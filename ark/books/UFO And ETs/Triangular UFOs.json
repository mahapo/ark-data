Alexander, Ph.D. At the far end of the dais, quietly we sat next to each other for anobligatory panel discussion. It was at the 2012 Ozark UFO conference, and wewere both considering how different our positions were from the otherpresenters, all well-known in UFOlogy circles. Based on science and facts, weeach had laid out strong arguments for the reality of UFOs and expressed theneed for serious study of the topic. Certainly the immediate feedback confirmedthat the true-believers were as bad as the skeptics in condemning anyone whodidn’t buy into some, if not all, of the most outlandish stories imaginable. Mypersonal favorite was the notion the UFOs often crashed in thunderstorms.Apparently the highly advanced UFOnauts could transit the vastness of space, butdid not understand the basics of electromagnetic interference, something thehuman aviation industry conquered decades ago. Despite the obvious lack ofcommon sense the audience ate it up. Maintaining contact, Dave sent me more material about his studies oftriangular UFOs. His was comprehensive research into an important subset of theUFO phenomenon; something that no one else has attempted previously. Whileseveral people have written short papers about triangular UFOs, Dave’s work wasin-depth and compelling. I was particularly impressed as it circumvented one ofmy main concerns; i.e. “What constitutes a UFO?” Unfortunately it is a term usedbroadly and without clear definition. Reports of UFOs range from little balls oflight, often high in the sky, to large physical objects, possibly more than amile across. Besides small and far away there are other observations by crediblewitnesses at very close proximity to the craft. My real concern remains theenormous variability in observations when considering this global issue. Thereare just too many varieties to accommodate any single simple solution. Positinglittle grey guys from Zeta Reticula, who have come to collect sperm, or moreperversely conduct anal probes, just won’t do it. As with any good researchproject the first step is to establish parameters delimiting the topic and makeit manageable; and Dave has done that. This book provides the first extensive examination of reports of largetriangular shaped UFOs. Fitting with my own disposition, he conclusivelyeliminates the most popular conspiracy theory about their origin—that they areproducts of secret research of the U.S. government. Anyone who has heard mespeak on the UFO topic should remember my admonition about the three thingsnecessary before engaging studies in phenomenology. First, you need a sense ofhumor as you will be attacked. The most vicious barbs will come from those inthe UFO community, not the skeptics. Second, you better have a day job (as Davedoes) because nobody is making big money at this. Finally, and most important,you must understand conspiracy theory as you are automatically part of it.Either you believe there is a U.S. government cover-up, or you are part of thatprocess. Amazingly, even government officials, especially from foreigncountries, often believe in the cover-up hypothesis. Regarding triangular UFOs in particular, conspiracy theorists repeatedly havetaken the position mentioned above—secret government research. It never matteredthat such a conclusion defies both facts and logic. Specifically, while thegovernment does develop advanced aircraft in secret, they do no conduct testflights of well-illuminated prototypes near major metropolitan areas. Yet, thatis where many of the large triangular UFOs have been observed. The proponents of such theories also fail to understand how military aircraftare either developed or employed. Foremost, new systems are all designed to meetspecific objectives and built to specific requirements. Other than aerostats,the most likely application of a large aircraft is for logistical purposes; thatis to move huge quantities of materials to a combat area. The development ofsuch a capability would constitute a major breakthrough. Having participated inseveral high-level wargames I can state unequivocally that logistics is alwaysthe long pole in the tent. That means getting sufficient quantities of materialto the warfighters is always the limiting factor in the ability to prosecutewars. Here observations step in. The U.S. has been engaged in the Global War onTerror in two major areas, Iraq and Afghanistan, for more than a decade. In thelatter, getting supplies to the troops has been particularly obstreperousespecially traversing the Khyber Pass through Pakistan. The arduous long-haulalternatives through Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are equally problematic. Still,the hypothesized large triangular craft have not been seen in either area ofoperation. Of course the reason is that the USAF simply doesn’t have them intheir inventory. Lack of use in current wars, however, is not the decisive factor thatcategorically eliminates the conspiracy theory of government development ofthese elusive craft. The coffin nail is Dave’s discovery that large triangularUFO sighting occurred as early as 1882, over two decades before the WrightBrothers first powered flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina in 1903. Obviouslythose observations put triangular UFOs far beyond the technological grasp of anyhuman source. In fact, large triangular UFOs have been observed from that time to thepresent and in many areas of the world. Previously I have reported that whileparticipating in a NATO study of a more mundane nature, some Belgian officersdid ask me if they belonged to the U.S. That was shortly after the pervasivesightings of 1989-1990. Not long after that I was chairing a non-lethal weaponsconference in Tysons Corner, Virginia. One of the speakers was an Air Forcemajor general whom I had met years before when we were attending courses atHarvard. Aware of my interest in UFOs he inquired what was happening in thefield. As he had previously been the director of all USAF research anddevelopment at Wright-Patterson AFB, I took the opportunity to ask him aboutthese large triangular objects. He indicated we had nothing larger than the C-5although the Russian Antonov AN-124 is even bigger. Neither of those approachthe size reported on many occasions. I am also aware of a proposal by one of themajor aerospace defense contractors to build a large semi-rigid,lighter-than-air craft specifically for logistical purposes. They indicated theycould not even get any military support for the concept, and that was within thepast fifteen years. So, if they are not “ours,” then, who does fly them and from where do theyoriginate? Those are legitimate questions, but it is unlikely they will beaddressed anytime soon. The fundamental problem is that political correctnessdrives away the best and brightest scientists—at least if they value theircareer. It is an unfortunate reality that mere association with the study ofUFOs can bring discredit to research in conventional areas. Good scientists whowish to explore phenomena do so at great risk to their livelihood. That issomething that must change before we will make any significant advances in ourunderstanding of UFOs or other phenomena. Inauspiciously, it is many of the people in Ufology who exacerbate thissituation. One has but to attend most any UFO conference to spot them. They arespeakers and attendees alike. The wilder the story presented, the more likelythat it will be enthusiastically received. As I have stated repeatedly, thereare no lower limits to such crazy stories. Emotion trumps facts every time. Whenany serious, yet reasonably skeptical scientist enquires about UFOs, they areregaled by utter nonsense, and too often assume that the entire field iscorrupted. Then too there are the debunkers and hoaxers who bring discredit to thefield. Most debunkers are guilty of addressing facts very selectively, andrarely have explanations that fit all of the reported aspects. Hoaxers too oftenprove the gullibility of the UFO community, but it is an easy target.Importantly, hoaxes are not benign as many would believe. Some attempts, such assending burning flares aloft are inherently dangerous. In fact, skeptics haveclaimed that some of the large triangles have actually been teams of ultra-lightor similar aircraft flying in formation at night without traditional aviationlights. We are asked to believe that the nefarious pilots risk life and limb forthe pleasure of perpetrating a perverse joke. With the famous Bentwaters UFOcase the public alternately was asked to believe it was a lighthouse, a burningdung wagon, radioactive rabbits, and even a dropped NASA dummy Apollo mooncapsule, none of which fit the facts. The bottom line to this book is that large triangular UFOs have been seen inmany areas of the world. Most important, they have been around for a long, longtime. They have been reported by numerous credible witnesses and offer animportant subset of the UFO phenomenon, one worthy of serious scientific study.Like Dave, I sincerely hope scientists will be able to get past the debunkers,hoaxers, and the credulous true believers. At some point in time maybe that willhappen. From the history of large triangular UFO sightings, it is most probablethat they will continue to perplex us for a long time to come. John B.

Preface The subject of UFOs is one of the most controversial subjects today. Mostpeople have an opinion about it. These opinions fall somewhere along thespectrum of acceptance on one hand and rejection on the other. For some people,either you believe in UFOs or you don’t. For years people would ask me “Do youbelieve in UFOs?” I was always uneasy with the term “believe.” When discussing the belief in something, it evokes religious connotations inmy mind. It is suggestive of faith-based ideologies. I have always attempted toapproach the subject in an objective manner and examine the facts. I was notlooking for an alternative religion or spiritual path as many have attemptedthrough the vehicle of the UFO subject. Rather, I was interested in followingthe evidence to where it may, or may not, lead. I wanted to ascertain whether ornot there was truly something behind this mystery. I would best characterize myself as one who is open-minded yet skeptical.When people would ask me in the course of interviews or lectures if I “believe”in UFOs, I would usually respond by saying “I believe the subject needs to beexamined more thoroughly.” I have stated this for years and cling to thisposition yet today. A more accurate statement would be “I accept the possibleexistence of UFOs as a tangible reality based on the available information.”This may seem like an exercise in semantics – “belief” versus “acceptance.”However, I feel this is a more accurate descriptive. In dealing with the general public, I was amazed how passionately many clungto their position on UFOs despite their admission they didn’t know muchregarding the subject. Obviously, everyone is entitled to their individualopinions, but shouldn’t these opinions be educated ones? Prior to formulating anopinion, I would encourage people to study the subject matter. Upon review ofthe material, you will then have a better appreciation for the subject includingsalient points to address when having a discussion or debate on the topic. For many others, the subject of UFOs is the last thing they are concernedabout. With the current period of worldwide financial collapse facing countries,citizens are faced with finding jobs and providing for their families. They donot have the luxury of time used to contemplate the existence or non-existenceof UFOs even if the interest is there. In addition, they may feel there is nopersonal relevance to them and their lives. This I can certainly appreciate. I have often thought that many people mentally place UFO eyewitnesses in thesame category as people who have been struck by lightning. Certainly, bothincidents are dramatic. People have heard stories of these events happening.However, most people assume this is something that happens to other people – notthemselves. Most of us never think we are going to be struck by lightning or seea UFO. None-the-less, some of these same people may be outside one day and look upand see an airborne object they cannot readily identify. Suddenly, they arefaced with an unknown element in their life. When this occurs, many peopleignore what they have witnessed. They decide to live in denial and move on withtheir lives. Yet others will be captivated by what they have witnessed. Manytimes, depending on the nature of the sighting, the individual will becomeobsessed with the subject of UFOs. For many researchers in the field of UFOlogy,this is how they personally were drawn to the subject. This brings us to the term “UFO.” When this acronym is mentioned, itoftentimes elicits giggles and smirks by individuals. Interestingly enough, itis more of a visceral reaction – a knee jerk response of sorts. In today’ssociety, “UFO” has become synonymous with “alien spacecraft.” This should simplynot be the case. The term itself was created in the early 1950s by the UnitedStates Air Force to replace the more fanciful term being tossed about at thetime - “flying saucers.” From its inception, the term UFO simply meant “unidentified flying object.”This is how I employ the term throughout this book. In fact, many witnessesthemselves that claim to have seen UFOs will state they don’t know what theysaw. Why then should we impose the “alien spacecraft” overtones to their reportsif they themselves are not? Taking a step back for one moment and viewing the scenario objectively, whatis wrong with someone stating they witnessed an “unidentified flying object”?Many objects that we witness in the sky may be unidentified based on our limitedknowledge or perceptual limitations. These can range from satellites, militaryaircraft, meteors, atmospheric phenomena, etc. I believe the emotional reaction to the term “UFO” has developed over time inpart due to the influence of movies over the years as well as the news media’suse of the subject as tongue-in-cheek reporting – taking a legitimate sightingreport and poking fun at the report and oftentimes the witnesses themselves. While we all like to have a laugh now and again, myself included, we shouldask ourselves “Where is this laughter coming from?” Are we responding to asituation due to its intrinsic humor or are we responding with nervous laughter?On the outside, many people are laughing because they do not wish to contemplatethe possibility that we could be visited by a non-terrestrial civilization. Somecannot mentally wrap their minds around the concept while others may see this asan affront to their religious beliefs. Regardless of their reasoning, perhapsthe laughter serves as a coping mechanism for many people. I have had the honor of meeting hundreds of people over the years who fallsomewhere along the spectrum of acceptance and rejection of the UFO subject.Many of my friends and I have had numerous and lengthy discussions on thesubject. For years, both friends and colleagues have continually posed thequestion to me, “When are you going to write a book on UFOs?” If you knew of mylifelong interest in the subject and the wealth of books and other materials inmy personal library, it would seem like a reasonable question. Typically, most authors write books based on at least one of the followingcriteria. First, it is a subject they feel passionate about. Second, it involvesa subject or event they were associated with directly. Or third, they wish toraise public awareness regarding a topic. All of these apply to me and thewriting of this book as you will discover. However, I would only write a book on the UFO subject based on threeadditional criteria. First, it would have to be material that I considered trulysignificant to the field of UFOlogy. Second, this position would have to beshared by my colleagues in addition to myself. Finally, it would need to beoriginal material and not a rehash of “classic” cases and research that havebeen documented in dozens of books previously published. Taking each criterionin-turn, let’s discuss them further. The first involves my viewing the material as truly significant to the UFOresearch field. Over the last ten to twenty years, there have been a growingnumber of UFO reports involving so-called flying triangles or triangular UFOs.These, like other UFO reports, come from witnesses of varying age, education,and socioeconomic background. They are also reported worldwide. As will soon become clear, a series of events drew my attention to thisparticular subset of UFO data. As I began to research these reports in greaterdetail, I noticed a majority of the cases had many common characteristics. When I was working on this project in 2004, I examined frequency datapertaining to these UFO reports. I knew these sightings were prevalent, but towhat extent? In my opinion, the best source of raw reports was Peter Davenport’sNational UFO Reporting Center (www.ufocenter.com). Although, these cases are notinvestigated prior to posting in most cases, it at least provides a researcherwith information regarding what people are reporting. It should be noted thatthe reports listed there are primarily from North America. I was amazed to see how the statistics played out when I examined the numberof reports broken down into their respective categories based on UFO shapes. Asof November 2004, the data was as follows: Unspecified1848Chevron402Cigar817Circle2233Cone134Crescent2Cross86Cylinder466Delta8Diamond456Disk2439Egg373Fireball1739Hexagon1Light5509Other2274Oval1261Pyramid1Rectangle396Round2Sphere1614Teardrop264Triangle2782 Apart from the ambiguous category of “light,” the main geometric shape peoplewere reporting was that of the triangle. This surpassed the classic flying“disk” by 343 reports. Obviously, statistics can be examined and interpreted ina myriad of ways. I only share these statistics to emphasize that many reportsnow involve triangular UFOs. Also, it must be added that these reports are a cumulative total of reportsgathered since The National UFO Reporting Center was founded back in 1974 byveteran UFO researcher, Bob Gribble. In addition, many reports involve UFOsightings that purportedly occurred prior to 1974. But the vast majority of UFOreports there date typically from the 1960s to the present day. In preparation for a lecture on the subject in February 2012, I re-examinedthe website for an updated tally of UFO reports received. Not much had changedin the way of reporting distribution based on UFO shapes. Again, other than thecategory of “light,” triangles continued to surpass other reported shapes.

However, I noticed that no one had written a comprehensive bookon the subject encompassing not only the reports themselves, but a detailedhistorical examination of them as well. How could this be? The traditional“flying saucer” no longer was in the majority. Now triangular UFOs appeared todominate the scene, yet no book was dedicated to analyzing them. I must, at this point, make mention of one man in the context of researchinto triangular UFOs. Despite not having written a book-length treatise ontriangular UFOs, veteran British researcher, Omar Fowler, has written two verywell-researched monographs on the subject. The first was The Flying TriangleMystery, published in 1996. This was followed by the second report, FlyingTriangle UFOs: The Continuing Story, in 1997. Both of these were published byThe Phenomenon Research Association. Up to this point, these were the only comprehensive reports that examined theoverall phenomenon. Certainly, there were well-written articles on individualcases involving triangular UFOs, but Mr. Fowler deserves credit where credit isdue. He took the time to examine a multitude of cases available to him. Thesewere primarily from England and from the previous ten years with a fewexceptions dating even earlier. Indeed, he laid the groundwork for publishedresearch into these flying triangles or “FTs” as he refers to them. He was aninspiration to my work and we have exchanged information over the years. He hasalso been kind enough to share information contained in this book With the events that transpired in January of 2000 coupled with myever-growing library of rare UFO material, I fostered the idea of writing a bookon the subject of UFOs. But for anyone who has written a similar book ofhistorical material, you know the amount of data gathering that is required. Itis time consuming and labor-intensive. In addition, it should be noted that Ialong with other UFO researchers do this work in our spare time andout-of-pocket. So if a book were to develop, it would take some time. I feltstrongly that a book was needed that seriously addressed the nature of thesetriangular UFO reports. But was this feeling shared by others in the field? This brings me to my second criterion for publishing a book. Were colleaguesand others in the field interested in seeing well-documented reports that havebeen collated into a systematic analysis? Over time, this became obvious to meas I continued to network and share case material with investigators andresearchers like Omar Fowler in England. The defining moment where this became blatantly clear was when I lectured atThe Ozark UFO Conference in Eureka Springs, Arkansas in April of 2012. It wouldbe the fourth time I had lectured to audiences there. Historically, it was oneof the best UFO conferences in the United States. This was not just my opinionbut that of countless others who had attended over the years. I had a long history with this conference going back to 1991. It was thatyear I attended the conference for the first time. I had the distinct honor ofmeeting veteran UFO historian and researcher, Lou Farish. Lou was the host ofthe conference since 1989 and would continue that tradition until 2009. Lou wasunique in that he was very unassuming and simple in the way he presentedhimself. However, this belied the wealth of knowledge and experience he had inthe field. For anyone that had the pleasure of knowing him, they will tell you that hewas a walking encyclopedia of knowledge on UFOs and other paranormal subjects. Imet him in 1991 and developed a kinship with him regarding our mutual interestin UFO history and its preservation. To that end, Lou graciously entrusted hislibrary to me before his death in January 2012. Much of the material in thisbook derives from Lou’s collection. Lou initially invited me to speak at the conference back in 2000 on the casewe will discuss in Chapter One. Following that, as my historical research ontriangular UFOs developed, Lou wanted me to share my findings. He invited meback periodically to address the subject further as new case material wasdiscovered. He was interested and impressed with what I had to share. This wasthe validation I needed to continue my research. After Lou’s death in January of 2012, friends and conference organizers,Jerry Blackburn, Lee Clinton, and Paula King, invited me back to lecture on mylatest triangular UFO research. Despite having had audiences averaging 400 attendees each year and receivingthanks and encouragement after each lecture I presented, this 2012 audience waslarger and showed a tremendous amount of enthusiasm regarding my research.People wanted to know more about these triangular UFOs. I had to disappoint several audience members after my lecture. They asked ifI had a book on my research that they could purchase. I had to inform them thatI did not have a book on my research to-date. However, the decision to moveforward with this book, solidified on my flight home from that same conference.Again, if Lou Farish, other leading researchers, and audience members thoughtthis was significant to the field of UFOlogy, then it only bolstered my samefeelings on the matter. The last criterion, involving original material being presented, I believewill become readily apparent to the reader. I can’t describe it as “new”material as most of what we will examine will be historical in-nature. However,what is covered has never been assembled and presented in this manner. Again,this is the first book dedicated to this subset of UFO reports. This book is written with the purpose of placing focus on triangular UFOsighting reports. This book will not venture off into areas such as “alienabductions,” “government conspiracies,” etc. I want this book to appeal to awide audience with the focus on UFO sightings themselves. When examining the development of this phenomenon over the last severaldecades, UFO sightings are what started it all. UFO sightings are at the core ofthe phenomenon still today. Whether or not other subjects such as theaforementioned or crop circles, cattle mutilations, etc. are related to theseUFO sightings remains to be seen. There may be relationships between thesetopics, but evidence thus far is inconclusive and not necessarily causal innature. Simply put, in my research of over a decade, I have not seen evidence ofa relationship and therefore these topics will not be addressed in this work.Perhaps future researchers will explore these avenues and use this work as astarting point. This brings me to the title of the book. Obviously, we are focusing ontriangular UFO reports, but why refer to the book as “An Estimate of theSituation”? For those readers well acquainted with UFO history, this titleshould not be unfamiliar. In the very early days of the UFO phenomenon, the United States Air Force inJanuary of 1948 had launched “Project Sign” as their first official inquiry intothe subject. At the end of their initial review of the material, the members ofthe research group presented their findings in late 1948. The report wasreferred to as The Estimate of the Situation. This was typically how intelligence reports of this nature were titled whenan examination or investigation was launched into an event or subject formilitary review. After such an investigation, an estimate of the situation wasprepared for senior military review. The conclusion or estimate of the panelregarding this situation involving UFOs was that the phenomenon was most likelyinterplanetary in origin. This report circulated up the chain of command until it reached the desk ofGeneral Hoyt Vandenberg, the United States Air Force Chief of Staff. He rejectedthe report and its findings due to the lack of physical evidence to supporttheir conclusion. He then ordered all copies of the report destroyed. As aresult, no copies of the report exist today. However, Air Force personnel who were in key positions at the time referredto it in subsequent years. This select group included Captain Edward J. Ruppelt.Captain Ruppelt was one of the project leaders of a later successor to “ProjectSign” known as “Project Blue Book” that continued to investigate UFOs from 1952to 1969. Shortly after leaving Blue Book, Ruppelt stated he had seen the“Estimate.” In his book, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, Captain Ruppeltdescribed the Estimate as “a rather thick document with a black cover and it wasprinted on legal-sized paper. Stamped across the front were the words TOPSECRET.” Another individual who had rare access to the report was Major Dewey Fournet.Major Fournet served as the Pentagon Liaison Officer for Project Blue Book andwas Captain Ruppelt’s superior. In the course of Fournet’s duties, he tooreviewed the Estimate. Like Captain Ruppelt, Major Fournet years later wouldpublicly acknowledge the one-time existence of the report. In my library, I havea rare audio recording of an interview with Major Fournet in which he discussesthe report’s existence and the differing opinions within military circlesregarding it. This report was important for two reasons. First, it was the initialassessment commissioned by the United States Air Force on the UFO subject. Thiswas their comprehensive analysis of the UFO phenomenon based on all availableinformation at the time. Many reports would certainly follow as the Air Forceredefined their projects and mandates regarding the subject matter. However, second and more importantly, was the conclusion reached by themilitary analysts and scientists of the time. Namely, that whatever thephenomenon, it could not be explained away by prosaic natural phenomena,military aircraft, hoaxes, hallucinations, etc. The best explanation and sourceof the phenomenon was interplanetary (i.e., extra-terrestrial). Based on the legendary nature of this report coupled with the conclusionspurportedly contained therein, it seemed only appropriate as the title for thisbook. This “Estimate” focuses on triangular UFO reports, but it serves as acomprehensive analysis of the available information to date. It must beacknowledged that any such report can only provide an overview of the subject. Ihave tried to assemble a representative sampling of cases to review, butobviously do not have the space to address every case on record. This is the first UFO book dedicated solely to the triangular UFO phenomenon.It will examine the history of sightings; outline patterns within the data; anddevelop a working profile of these objects. Upon reading this book, I hope thedata speaks for itself. I believe it strongly suggests we are dealing with atangible reality that has been with us for a very long time and requires furtherscientific investigation. It is my hope that this book will be read by not only the general public, butby individuals currently within key military and intelligence positions. Introduction Prior to delving into the subject matter, it might be best to explain how Ibecame involved in the UFO subject in the first place. There were three eventsearly in life that molded my interest in UFOs. It all started back in the yearof 1973 at the ripe young age of five years old while living in SouthernIllinois just east of St. Louis, Missouri. In early 1973 around the small Missouri town of Piedmont, UFOs were the topicof conversation. Piedmont is located 130 miles south/southwest of St. Louis,Missouri. On February 21st of that year, a basketball coach from Piedmont alongwith five members of his team were coming home after losing a game earlier thatevening in another town. As their vehicle was winding across the hilly roads ofSoutheast Missouri, their attention was drawn to an unusual “rotation of lights”in the sky. Despite being intrigued, they continued on their journey down Route60 while periodically seeing the lights both above and through the denselywooded terrain. When they reached a portion of the highway outside of Piedmont where one sideopened into a large open field, they noticed what appeared to be the same seriesof lights. This time, they noticed the lights appeared to be attached to sometype of object. This object was hovering in one spot above the field. Thispiqued their curiosity enough to pull the vehicle over to the shoulder of theroad and get a better look. The passengers assembled outside the vehicle andwatched in disbelief. As they watched, they could make out red, green, amber, and white lightswhich continued to rotate. It should be noted that at this time no sound or windappeared to emanate from the object as one would commonly associate with ahelicopter or conventional aircraft in this situation. The witnesses believedthe lights to be less than 200 yards away and approximately 50 feet off theground. After about 10 minutes, the series of lights rose at an angle and disappearedover a ridge. It was this incident that started the wave of UFO sightings thatwould follow in 1973 for this sleepy southeastern Missouri town. So how does this incident relate to my involvement in UFOs? Well, thebasketball coach’s name was Reggie Bone and he was one of my father’s bestfriends when they were both young. My father was born and raised in theneighboring town of Mill Spring, Missouri, before moving to the greater St.Louis metropolitan area. When my father read of this sighting, which was heavily publicized by thelocal newspaper as well as the St. Louis area newspapers, he was intrigued tosay the least. Added to this, a flood of additional UFO reports began to comeinto the local police department as well as the newspaper and radio station.Piedmont was in the midst of “UFO Fever”! Many people, having read the newspaper articles; heard the radio interviews;and seen the television news coverage, decided to see for themselves what wasgoing on. All along the country roads outside of Piedmont, visitors were campingout and conducting night vigils in the hopes of seeing the UFOs for themselves.My family was no exception. As an impressionable young boy, I was caught up in the excitement of seeingmy father, older brothers, and sister pack up the car with binoculars andthermoses of coffee as they prepared to take the two and a half hour drive downto Piedmont to “look for UFOs.” Much to my mother’s chagrin, this activity, as Iremember, happened more than once that spring and summer. The kids had a casualinterest in the subject of UFOs. My mother had as much in the way of disinterestin the subject. So, being only five years old, I was tasked with the duty ofstaying home with mom and letting my father and older siblings have their fun. I know that my father was always open to the subject of UFOs. However, whenone of his childhood friends reported seeing an unconventional aerial object,his interest became intensified. It was for this reason that he made his tripsdown there. He knew Reggie. He grew up with him. He knew he wouldn’t lie orembellish a story. He took him at his word. He saw something. The question was:What? Despite not joining the UFO search party, I remember hearing the stories upontheir return of others whom they met, and who supposedly had witnessed UFOs inthe area. Those witnesses would later include some of my father’s relatives. Hisaunt and uncle were among these people. Years after the event, they would stilltalk about the UFO sightings in the area. It should be noted that 1973 was anextremely active year for reported UFO activity in the United States. I was severely disappointed as a five year old to be excluded from somethingas exciting as chasing UFOs. But little did I know at the time, I would laterdevote my entire adult life to pursuing this elusive subject and would spendmany a night in UFO hotspots staring up at the star-filled sky in anticipationof seeing a genuine UFO. I guess I inherited this legacy from my father andbrothers starting in 1973. However, this was only the first in a series of threethings that captivated me as a youngster. The next event was much more dramaticand closer to home. It was a late night in the summer of 1977, and my sister, Cheryl, and herhusband, Joe, were returning to Kansas City, Missouri from a visit with myfamily in the St. Louis area. To properly set the scene, my sister was asleep inthe front passenger seat and her husband was driving. The time was approximately12:00 am. They were on the last leg of their journey and were only within onemile of their home. As they approached an intersection, the vehicle stopped. Joe looked both waysbefore preparing to drive on when suddenly a brilliant white light envelopedtheir car. It was as if a light switch had been turned on. One moment, they weresitting at a dark street corner. Then, without any warning, the vehicle wasbathed in an intense light of some sort that seemed to be emanating from abovetheir vehicle. Despite this light display, there was a complete absence of noiseor wind. This is, of course, similar to Reggie Bone’s UFO sighting outside ofPiedmont as well as countless others on-file. In instances such as this, time seems to stand still. Your brain races tomake sense out of what is taking place and your adrenaline kicks in as yourheart rate increases. Joe certainly was no exception to this rule. He wasnotorious in our family for not enjoying discussions of ghosts, UFOs, or theparanormal in general. He didn’t like the subjects and they made himuncomfortable. This event was only destined to reinforce that mindset. As he tried to process what was taking place, he had the presence of mind totry to wake his wife who was still sleeping soundly next to him. My sisterrecalls it best by telling me that she woke from a sound sleep with Joe shakingher violently and yelling “Cheryl! Cheryl! Wake up!” My sister remembers trying to open her eyes, but that it was difficultbecause of the intense white light. This intensity combined with the fact shejust opened her eyes from a deep sleep, made it a difficult task to see clearly.But, in a matter of a few seconds, her eyes began to adjust. Her first thoughtas she looked out of the windshield was “Why is it light outside?” She knew whenthey left St. Louis and when they were due home, since they traveled this routemany times. They left late in the evening and were due home late that night. Whywas it daylight outside? Again, things move quickly in a situation as this and before she could ponderthings further, her attention was then focused on her husband who was yelling ina panic. Neither one can recall the exact statements made at this time. Sufficeit to say, there were very colorful words being thrown about. There’s no otherway to say it other than Joe was scared. Despite the fear, he did muster the courage to look out of his driver’s sidewindow at what was above the car. At best, he described a very large white lightthat was shining down on them, the vehicle, and the immediate surrounding area.But, in the midst of this light, he could discern multiple smaller lights ofvarying colors in no particular order. No structure was visible due to theintensity of the light, but he felt the lights had to be attached to somethingphysical. As the fear continued to rise in their vehicle, the light disappeared asabruptly as it initially appeared. Again, they likened it to a light switchbeing flipped. Nothing was seen moving away in the sky and the area once againbecame a dark street corner. Despite the street corner returning to normal, thesame could not be said for my sister or her husband. This is where the storytakes on another strange turn. After a dramatic event such as this, you would suspect the witnesses would beabuzz with conversation and questions about what just took place. This was notthe case at all. In fact, neither one recalled speaking to each otherimmediately after the incident, or when they arrived home several minutes later. My sister is a creature of habit. After returning home from any vacation ortrip, she would make it a point to unload the luggage from their car. She statedshe would never leave the bags sit in the trunk overnight. She wouldn’tnecessarily unpack the luggage, but would bring them in the house to be unpackedthe next day. On this night, she did no such thing. As they both recall, no words were said to each other after the incident orwhen they arrived home. They both said they went inside their home; went to thebedroom; changed clothes for bed; and got in bed and pulled the covers up overtheir heads. Does this sound rational? For those well-read on the subject of UFOs, this may not seem strange at all.There may be more here than meets the eye. The fact remains, this was my sisterand her husband and they reported an encounter with what can only be called aUFO. They never publicly discussed this story. It was something that only familyand close friends ever heard about. They both knew that everyone would not beopen-minded towards their tale. In fact, until just the last ten years or so, Joe never wanted to speak of itto anyone. Again, the paranormal is not his cup of tea to say the least. Theyhad nothing to gain by fabricating a story like this nor would they. Simply put- an event occurred that was beyond their explanation. But it was an event thatadded to my ever-growing curiosity regarding the subject. The third event or series of events that shaped my interest in UFOs occurredjust one year later. The year was 1978 and the location was a quaint little townknown as Elsberry, Missouri. Elsberry is located just 59 miles north/northwestof St. Louis, Missouri near the Mississippi River. It was here on April 26th that a mutilated steer was found by the owner onhis property. The police reports indicated the sex organs were removed and theblood was drained from the body. Now that was very bizarre news for such aconservative community. Although, we know how news travels quickly. It wasn’t long before additional cattle were found mutilated and UFOsightings were being reported as well into the summer of that year. Thisattracted the St. Louis newspaper, radio, and television reporters eager for agood news story. I remember the news coverage on TV as a young ten year old. All of the localnews channels were on-location with their cameras hoping to interview witnessesas new cases developed. People from all over the area were converging onElsberry to sky watch and look for UFOs. It had become a media circus. Despite the carnival atmosphere, the local law enforcement officials weretaking this seriously. The bottom-line was that landowners were losing cattle.This was a crime as far as they were concerned. These cattle represented theirlivelihood and someone or something was killing them. This fact could not bedenied. The UFO sightings and cattle mutilations that started in Elsberry began tofilter out into other surrounding areas of Missouri later that year andcontinued to generate ample news coverage till the end of the year. Again, Icontinued to hear about these reports and pondered what this was all about. Whatindeed? After the 1973 Piedmont and 1978 Elsberry Missouri UFO waves, and hearingfirst-hand about my own sister’s UFO sighting, my interest in UFO researchcontinued to escalate. But it wasn’t until 1990 that I took an active role inUFO research. I began investigating UFO sightings for The Mutual UFO Network(MUFON) that year and I also began to slowly amass a large library of UFOmaterial. It is from this material that much of this book is derived. It was an article in the local newspaper that my mother had saved for me thatcatapulted me into having an active role in the subject of UFOs. The article wasa feature on a local man who served as the Illinois Assistant State Director forThe Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). The full-page article was complete with photosand was a well-written, serious piece on the UFO subject. With my level of interest in UFOs coupled with the fact the man in thearticle lived only fifteen minutes from my home, I decided to contact him andlearn more about MUFON and their investigative role regarding UFOs. The man’sname was Forest Crawford. He too had a lifelong interest in the subject. After an initial meeting with Forest that lasted hours into the late evening,I decided to join MUFON. Forest went from being a stranger to ultimately alifelong friend and colleague in the field of UFOlogy. He not only introduced meto the subject, but to many pioneers in the research field in the years thatfollowed. Shortly after joining MUFON in March of 1990, I began to acquire as muchwritten material on the subject as possible and became a voracious reader on thesubject. One of the sources of information was MUFON’s own monthly publication,The MUFON UFO Journal, also known as the MUFON Journal. I found some of thecases contained therein most interesting. In the July 1990 edition of the MUFON Journal (issue 267), I was firstintroduced to the subset of UFO reports known as “triangular UFOs.” Up to thistime, I was unaware of the complexity of UFO reports. Like most people, Iassumed most UFOs reported were shaped like flying saucers. Indeed, many reportsdescribe this type of object, especially in the early years of the phenomenon inthe late 1940s and throughout the 1950s. However, with this article, my eyeswere opened to a subject that would intrigue and ultimately confront me as aninvestigator ten years later. The 1990 article was written by veteran UFO researcher and journalist, BobPratt. The article was entitled “The Great Belgium UFO Flap” and was the coverstory. In it, Pratt described the series of UFO sightings that had been sweepingthe nation of Belgium since October 1989. The only thing that dwarfed the number of witnesses, now numbering in thethousands, was the seemingly immense size of the objects in question. Prattquoted witnesses as stating the objects were “as big as a football field” or “asbig as or bigger than an aircraft carrier.” What was being seen in Belgium? Pratt’s article went on to describe the ability of these objects to hover atvery low altitudes then rapidly accelerate away. Also, the immense objects werereported to make little or no noise. A characteristic that was very strangeinvolved the ability to pivot when turning as opposed to banking likeconventional aircraft. These objects, whatever they were, apparently could makeflat turns maintaining a horizontal position relative to the ground. [images/00004.jpg]Illustration by Benoit Vierin from Vague d’ OVNI sur la Belgique. One of the most compelling aspects of all of this was the fact the Belgianmilitary fully acknowledged the sightings and had tracked the objects on bothNATO ground and air-based radar systems. Pratt also discussed the pursuit by twoF-16 jet interceptors on the night of March 30, 1990 and the subsequent radartracking data obtained of the UFO. The best documentation for this event was created by the Belgian Air Forcesecretarial staff. This event prompted their creation of a document entitledReport on the observation of UFOs During the Night of March 30-31, 1990. Thereport dissected the events of that night in detail. We will quickly examinesome aspects of this report. The first notation referred to a UFO sighting by a local resident in themunicipality of Ramillies at 23:00 hours (GMT). He observed three bright lightsfrom his home there that appeared to be changing colors and were distinguishablefrom surrounding stars and planets. The Wavre gendarmerie dispatched a patrol toconfirm these reports. At 23:10, the resident called again to report a secondtriangle of lights that appeared near the first set of lights. At 23:28, the gendarmes arrive on the scene and confirm the eyewitnessreports. Minutes later, all observed these lights performing various acrobaticmaneuvers. Simultaneously, these “lights” appeared on radar at the trackingstation located in Glons based on the CRC (Control Reporting Center). Thistarget was also confirmed by the radar tracking station at Semmerzake at 23:49. Shortly after midnight, at 00:05, two F-16 jet interceptors were dispatchedto identify the targets. The report is quoted as follows: “Between 00 h 07 and00 h 54, under control of the CRC, on the whole nine interception attempts havebeen undertaken by the fighters. The planes have had, several times, brief radarcontacts on the targets designated by the CRC. In three cases, the pilotsmanaged to lock on the target during a few seconds, which, each time, induced adrastic change in the comportment of the UFOs. In no case, the pilots have had avisual contact with the UFO.” A quick example of the radical maneuvers measured and observed by the F-16sinvolved one of the UFOs traveling initially at 7,000 feet at 150 knots whichthen climbed to an altitude of 10,000 feet at 570 knots in a matter of seconds.Then it abruptly descended to only 500 feet in the span of five seconds movingat an incredible 990 knots! Despite moving in excess of the speed of sound, nosonic boom was noted. The Belgian Air Force alludes to this in their reportconclusions. Some other conclusions they noted in the report were:> > > •The visual evidences, on which this report is partially based, come from> > gendarmes on duty, whose objectivity cannot be questioned.> > •The speeds measured at that time (radar lock on) and the altitude shifts> > exclude the hypothesis according to which planes could be mistaken for the> > observed UFOs.

Moreover, the hologram cannot be detected by radar,> > and a laser projection can be seen only if there is a screen, like clouds> > for example.

At the center of the worldwide media attention during this UFO wave wasColonel Wilfried De Brouwer of the Belgian Air Force. Colonel (later MajorGeneral) De Brouwer was Chief of the Operations Division in the Air Staff andserved as the official spokesman for the Belgian Air Force throughout thisperiod of time. Since his retirement, he has continued to be vocal regarding theseries of UFO events that occurred in Belgium. On November 12th, 2007, an assemblage of highly credible individuals fromvarious military and aviation groups from around the world gathered together todiscuss the subject of UFOs. The event was held at the National Press Club inWashington D.C. One of the many distinguished speakers was General De Brouwer.He made the following statement at the event: > “My name is Wilfried De Brouwer. I am a retired Major General of the Belgian> Air Force and I was Chief (of) Operations in the Air Staff when an exceptional> UFO wave took place over Belgium.> Indeed, during the evening of 29 November 1989, in a small area in Eastern> Belgium, approximately 140 UFO sightings were reported. Hundreds of people saw> a majestic triangular craft with a span of approximately 120 feet, powerful> beaming spot lights, moving very slowly without making any significant noise> but, in several cases, accelerating to very high speeds.> The following days and months, many more sightings would follow. The UFO wave> would last more than one year during which a Belgian UFO organization> conducted more than 650 investigations and recorded more than 400 hours of> audio witness reports.

The> technical evidence was insufficient to conclude that abnormal air activities> took place during that evening.> In short, the Belgian UFO wave was exceptional and the Air Force could not> identify the nature, origin and intentions of the reported phenomena.” Of course, this is just a brief taste of the Belgian UFO wave of 1989-1991.Much has been written on the subject in other books and on various websites. Imention it only as a prelude for later developments that ultimately led me towrite this book. I was amazed by the nature of these triangular UFO reportscoming out of Belgium. My interest was multi-faceted. First, we are not talking about “lights in the sky” UFO reporting that couldeasily be explained away in conventional terms. These sightings appear to bewhat I would term “unambiguous” UFO reports. Most eyewitnesses in Belgiumdescribed structured craft of immense size upwards of 300 feet in length.Misidentification, although possible, is not likely given the nature of thereports and corroboration by numerous eyewitnesses. Second, we are looking at the Belgian military who obviously was taking thematter seriously. More importantly, they were sharing information with theBelgian UFOlogists and public at-large including radar lock-on by one of theF-16s in addition to ground-based radar tracking. I would continue to follow these triangular UFO reports coming out of Belgiumalong with others from varying countries including the United States andEngland. Reports consisted of equilateral as well as isosceles triangular flyingplatforms. They were compelling accounts, but only one aspect of the UFO subjectas a whole. I was studying all I possibly could at the time regarding theoverall subject. During the next ten years, my knowledge of the UFO subject increased as didmy UFO library. I had conducted numerous UFO investigations and worked with lawenforcement on some cases and I had attended many meetings and conferences andnetworked with many fellow-researchers. I had even begun lecturing on thesubject of UFOs. My interest continued to blossom. Then my life changed with one particular UFO case. Chapter 1:The New Millennium For most people who remember the dawning of the year 2000, it had nothing todo with the subject of UFOs. On Saturday, Jan. 1st, some of us were stillsharing a collective sigh of relief that the dreaded Y2K doomsday event did notoccur at the stroke of midnight. The world was still there and all of us had toreturn to our jobs and continue to pay taxes come Monday morning. Life went onas usual, at least for the first few days. In the cold early morning hours of Wednesday, Jan. 5th, something was movingin the sky over the State of Illinois. Something was about to set off a seriesof events that would forever change the lives of those involved. The first person to notice anything unusual that early morning was Mr.Melvern Noll. Mr. Noll is the owner of a miniature golf course located inHighland, Illinois, which is approximately 24 miles east of St. Louis, Missouri.During the off-season, Mr. Noll is a truck driver making deliveries at all hoursof the day and night. Mr. Noll was returning from a delivery run he had justcompleted at approximately 4 a.m. Before returning home, he thought he wouldcheck his miniature golf course and make sure everything was in order. He parked his truck in the back of the building and began to exit thevehicle. While doing so, he noticed a “bright star” over in the northeast sky.He didn’t give it much thought at the time and proceeded to enter the building.After checking things inside, he locked the building and was returning to histruck. Again, he noticed the “bright star” in the northeast sky. This time, hestopped and observed it more closely. He noticed the light was, in fact, moving in his general direction. In just afew minutes, Mr. Noll noticed the bright white light was only part of a largerobject which appeared to be rectangular in shape. The apparent size of theobject was comparable to the size of a football field. Mr. Noll added that theobject was also very tall and had a series of “windows” that ran down the side.He also noticed two “floors” each having two “windows.” These were described asrectangular with an intense white light radiating out from them. The “windows”appeared to be located more toward the rear of the object. When the object wasvery close, Mr. Noll stated he could see a large number of dim red lights on thebottom. He assumed the exterior color must have been black or dark gray. [images/00028.jpg]Based on Melvern Noll’s Sketch. The description he used to initially describe the object was looking like a“two-story house” in the sky. During this time, Mr. Noll did not notice anysound, odor, or emission coming from the object. As it moved away to thesouthwest, Mr. Noll noticed “windows” on the back of the object. He added thatthese appeared to have a series of vertical lines or bars. The object appeared to move in a northeast to southwest direction. The speedwas determined to be slow when compared to conventional aircraft. Mr. Noll didstate that he recalls the object slowing down as it passed in close proximity tohim before regaining speed as it moved away. Mr. Noll estimated the object waspossibly a half-mile distant when it moved closest to his location. The altitudewas estimated to be approximately 500 feet. The duration of this sighting wasestimated to be around 5 minutes in length. Mr. Noll promptly drove his pickup truck to the Highland Police Station. Hethought that nobody would believe him, if he told his story. He hoped that theHighland Police could contact a neighboring town’s police officer that couldverify there was something strange in the sky. The dispatcher at the Highland Police Department listened to Mr. Noll’saccount and determined that he was a rational individual, despite his unusualclaim. She then contacted the Lebanon Police Department located 15 miles to thesouthwest. Officer Ed Barton responded to the call at 4:12 a.m. Officer Barton was initially skeptical upon hearing the transmission. Heasked the dispatchers if they were joking. They stated they were not joking. Hethen proceeded to the north end of town, past Horner Park, on Widicus Road. Hedid not see anything in the sky at this time. He then followed Widicus Road, asit turns from the North to the East, heading towards Illinois Route 4. About halfway to Route 4, Officer Barton observed two large, brilliant whitelights in the northeastern sky. The lights appeared so close together thatOfficer Barton thought they were almost touching each other. He stated thelights were so brilliant in intensity that the light rays radiated outward likethe symbol of the Japanese Rising Sun battle flag from World War II. He becamecurious and decided to drive a little faster. Upon arriving at Illinois Route 4, Officer Barton turned south, heading backtowards Lebanon. He was able to observe the lights to his left through hisdriver’s side window as he was proceeding into town. At some point, as he wasalternating between watching the lights and the road in front of him, the twobright lights now appeared to be one bright light. At this point, he switched onhis overhead lights. He now believed this could possibly be an aircraft havingproblems. Upon arriving in town, he made a left turn onto East Route 50 and proceededeast to a bridge at the bottom of the hill. At this point, he noticed the onebright light now appeared as an elongated cigar-shaped object and appeared to bestationary in the sky over the northeast end of the neighboring town ofSummerfield. At this point, he stopped on the side of the road. He did this because he nownoticed the object appeared to be heading in his direction. He stated it was notmoving very fast, but not very slowly either. Upon stopping the vehicle, heturned off all the lights and his squad car’s radio in an attempt to hear anynoise possibly coming from the object. No noise was evident. As it approached, he noticed the distinct shape of the object. It appeared asa massive, elongated, narrow triangle. It appeared larger in length than width.The apparent size of the object was conservatively estimated to be approximately75 feet in length and 40 feet in width. At each point, Officer Barton observed,was a massive, bright, white light. These lights did not waver in intensity andappeared to be pointing straight down. He stated they did not light up theground, but were very bright. In addition to these, there was one smallerflashing red light. which was situated closer to the two rear white lights, yetin the midline of the object. He noticed that the object was blotting out thestars above it, as it passed by him. He still could not discern any noiseemanating from the object. [images/00064.jpg]Based on Officer Ed Barton’s Sketch At this time, the object appeared to be closest to Officer Barton. Heestimated the object was no more than 100 feet distant and approximately 1,000feet above the ground. Then he observed the object rotating in the sky. It wasnow pointed towards the southwest. As it rotated, the object did not bank as isexpected of conventional aircraft. Rather, the object pivoted in mid-air withouttilting to one side or the other and remained completely level. At this point, Officer Barton reached down into his squad car to radioCentral Command to tell them what he was observing. As he rose up with hismicrophone in hand, he noticed the object was off in the distance to thesouthwest. He was able to observe the rear of the object before it moved off. His bestanalogy was in comparing it to the Millennium Falcon spacecraft from the motionpicture Star Wars. It appeared to be rectangular and illuminated by white light.Through the middle of the light, running left to right, was a band ofmulti-colored illumination. He stated that there were not individual coloredlights that you could discern. Rather, it appeared as a band of various colors,which blended into each other. As the object disappeared from his line of sight, he continued thetransmission by informing Central Command that the object should now be aroundScott Air Force Base located approximately 8 miles to the southwest. Officer David Martin of the Shiloh Police Department then radioed that hecould indeed see something in the sky. Officer Martin was driving on thesouthern end of Shiloh heading east when he observed the mysterious object. Theobject appeared to be heading in a westerly direction. Officer Martin was ableto observe three brilliant white lights, which were shining light downward fromthe object. However, the light did not illuminate the ground or objects on theground. In addition, small red and green lights were observed on the back end ofthe object. At this time, Officer Martin thought the object’s altitude was approximately1,000 feet. He estimated the distance from his car to the object was about aquarter of a mile. He thought the object resembled the shape of an extra widetriangle or arrowhead. He noted that the underside of the object appeared to beconstructed of individual pieces that were put together like “building blocks.”He stated it did not have a smooth bottom as one would expect with conventionalaircraft. He estimated the apparent size to be 75-100 yards wide. Officer Martin was driving slowly during his observations. He also rolleddown his driver’s side window to determine if the object was emitting any sound.No sound could be heard. Officer Martin estimated the object’s initial speed to be the equivalent of15 mph. He then noticed the object had relocated further down the road in asplit second right before his very eyes. He indicated the object must have movedat an incredible rate of speed to instantaneously relocate itself in the mannerit did. He was very perplexed by this aspect. The object then continued to moveaway from him. The whole time the object remained silent. [images/00027.jpg]Based on Officer David Martin’s Sketch. Then 15 miles to the southwest in the town of Millstadt, Illinois, OfficerCraig Stevens was on patrol and heard the radio traffic regarding this wholeaffair. His curiosity was aroused and he drove to the east end of Millstadt inan attempt to see this mysterious thing in the sky. After not seeing anything atthat location, he proceeded to Liederkranz Park on the north end of town. While sitting in his car, he observed a very large object that was roughlytriangular in shape. Officer Stevens estimated the object to be only 500-1,000feet in altitude. The flight speed was described as extremely slow. He alsostated there was no noise with the exception of a “low decibel buzzing sound”that he could barely discern. As he watched the object, it began moving to thenorth. He could see the object had a white light on the left side, right side,and center of the back end. In addition, there was a single red light on thebottom. The back end also appeared to be slightly recessed. At 4:39 a.m., Officer Stevens contacted his dispatcher to advise him that hecould now see the object. He then exited his vehicle and grabbed the Polaroidcamera from his squad car’s trunk that was typically used for crime scenephotos. He aimed the camera at the object and took a picture. Unfortunately, ashe mentioned the extreme cold temperatures of that morning (15-20 degreesFahrenheit) caused the camera to work poorly. However, Stevens was able toproduce one photo, though poor in quality before the object disappeared to thenorthwest. The photo did not yield any useful information as it only showed afew blurry lights against a black background. However, he should be commendedfor his efforts in attempting to photograph the object. [images/00065.jpg]Based on Officer Craig Steven’s Sketch. The last police officer to report seeing the object that morning was OfficerMatt Jany from Dupo, Illinois. He was located 8 miles to the northwest ofOfficer Stevens in Millstadt. Jany also heard the radio traffic that morning anddecided to take a look in the sky for himself. Several minutes after OfficerStevens’ radio transmission, Officer Jany observed an array of lights. Contraryto the other officers, he stated the object was at a relatively high altitudeand proceeding in a north-northeasterly heading. It was so high in the sky thatthe officer said he wouldn’t have noticed it, if it weren’t for all the radiotraffic. He stated it stayed to the east of Dupo. The altitude was described asbeing higher than that of a small plane but lower than that of a commercialaircraft. Officer Jany viewed the object through binoculars, but was only able to see aconglomeration of lights. There were white and red lights visible. The whitelights were at the extreme ends. The red lights were in the middle. Aside fromthe lights, he could not discern any size or shape due to the distance andaltitude. These witnesses provided enough data to project the flight path of the objectas it traveled over the Southern Illinois area. Assuming we are dealing with oneobject, it apparently came from the northeast and traveled slowly over Highlandto Summerfield. Once there, it turned to the southwest. It traveled within 1-2miles of Scott Air Force Base as it passed through Shiloh. Then it later arrivednear the town of Millstadt. It altered direction again and turned to thenorthwest. Shortly after that, the object then made a turn to the northeastwhile also increasing in altitude. The object apparently maintained a lowaltitude until this final maneuver. [images/00007.jpg] One particular portion of this object’s flight involved the object’s rapidrelocation as noted by Officer Ed Barton. When the object was located justoutside of Summerfield, it pivoted and was pointed in a southwesterly position.Upon looking away and then looking back, Barton noted the object appeared closeto Scott Air Force Base. It was then observed by Officer David Martin. Thedistance between these two locations is an estimated ten miles. The duration offlight between these two points was an estimated 2 to 3 seconds. According toone estimate, this calculated to 12,000 miles per hour. Given the object’sestimated altitude of 500 to 1,000 feet, this object should have created a sonicboom when it reached the sound barrier at roughly 742 miles per hour. Theresulting effect should have been the creation of a sonic boom which would haverattled the entire area. However, no such reports were made by the witnesses orresidents of the surrounding area. How could this happen? It should be noted that many individuals subsequent to this event assumed theeyewitnesses misidentified a conventional military aircraft. The witnesses havelived and worked in the immediate area surrounding Scott Air Force Base for manyyears and were accustomed to aircraft (military and otherwise). Officer Bartonnoted he was a self-described military brat who grew up on Air Force Bases andthat all aircraft he was aware of make some kind of noise. He then emphasizedthis mystery object made no noise. One of the most intriguing aspects of this case beyond the UFO itself was theproximity of a major military base in relation to the flight path of the UFO.Scott Air Force Base serves as the 375th Air Mobility Command. Scott is a majorplayer in the global mobility of troops, equipment, medical aid, etc. The basehas several key command and control elements that assist in various operationsfor all branches of the United States military worldwide. Organizationalelements based there include: U.S. Transportation Command, Air Mobility Command,Air Force Network Integration Center, the 618th Air and Space Operations Center(Tanker Airlift Control Center). In addition, it hosts a Reserve unit, the 932ndAirlift Wing, in addition to an Air National Guard unit and the 126th AirRefueling Wing. Due to the location of Scott Air Force Base in relation to the UFO sightings,I found it necessary to contact them. Despite a history of the U.S. Air Forcenot being forthright with sharing UFO-related information, I felt I shouldpursue every possible source of information and filed a Freedom of InformationAct (FOIA) Request and sought answers to four important questions concerning therecent UFO sighting. I promptly received a courteous, albeit uninformative,letter of response with my questions and related answers (see Appendix foractual letter). > “In answer to your four questions:> 1. Did your base receive any calls relating to this event? Answer: The only> calls we received have been from the media asking for information about the> event.> 2. Did your base have any air or ground observers that witnessed the object?> Answer: No, none that have come forward.> 3. Did your base track any unknown object(s) on radar on the night of 1/05/00?> Answer: No, our radar services are provided by the Federal Aviation> Administration at Lambert St. Louis International Airport.> 4. Is your base supporting or operating a craft that resembles the one> described above? Answer: No.” The St. Clair County Sheriff’s Office released the police dispatch audiorecordings from that morning. This was the result of a Freedom of InformationAct request filed by independent documentary filmmaker, Darryl Barker (seeAppendix for actual CENCOM summary letter). What follows are the relevanttransmissions with time stamps that pertain to this case: > Dispatcher: (4:11:55 a.m.) Lebanon, this is a call from Highland P.D. in> reference to a truck driver who just stopped in.

Having reviewed the initial details of this case, let us examine someparticular aspects. The first concerns the obvious differences in thedescriptions given by the witnesses. In examining the figures, we can see thereare major disparities between them. Mr. Noll describes a largerectangular-shaped object. Approximately twenty minutes later, Officer Barton reports seeing anelongated triangle. The other officers at least report seeing objects that areroughly triangular in appearance. Beyond differences in shape, we also havedifferences in the lighting configurations that were reported. Initially, I believed there were several possibilities for theinconsistencies. The first involved the most prosaic explanation. Namely,witnesses make errors in their interpretations of what they claim to have seen.This is a fact all objective UFO researchers must never forget. This is mostproblematic during nighttime sightings such as this one. One of the major problems relating to this is the issue of perspective. Fromwhat perspective did the witnesses view the object? Some witnesses werestationary while others were driving at the time of their sighting. Inparticular, Officer Barton’s descriptions vary, as he views the object fromdifferent distances and angles. To compound matters, the object was moving atvarious speeds and directions in relation to the observers. Another possible explanation for the varied descriptions could be attributedto the notion that there were multiple objects of differing shapes in the skythat night. This would explain why different descriptions were received. I wassomewhat skeptical regarding this due to a couple facts. The terrain aroundHighland, Summerfield, and Shiloh is relatively flat. On a clear night, like onJan. 5th, you can see for miles in all directions. This is especially truebetween Highland and Summerfield. If multiple objects were in the sky illuminated by an array of lights,observers should have seen any of them that were there. However, if a witness’attention was initially drawn to the sighting of a UFO, would they be scanningthe sky looking for others? That is highly doubtful. One would assume theirattention would be fixed on the UFO itself to the exclusion of all else. Yet, a third possible explanation could involve the object actually changingshape in flight. This is one of the more questionable ideas proposed. But, areview of the UFO literature will reveal a multitude of cases that involveobjects that appear to change form while being viewed by the observer. I onlyconsider it as a possibility. Later, we will explore other cases thatdemonstrate this behavior. A final aspect related to this case involves the subsequent media coverage ofthe event. Compared to the typical tongue-in-cheek media coverage concerning UFOsightings, this served as an exception to the rule. For the most part, the localSt. Louis area media coverage was extremely professional in its approach towardsthe story. I clearly recall the television news segments that covered this caseand the professionalism of the newscasters. In addition, the newspaper articleswere equally serious in their overall tone. I believe there are a few reasons for this refreshing attitude towards thissequence of UFO sightings. First, we have the caliber of eyewitnesses. Namely,we have police officers that had everything to lose and nothing to gain bycoming forward with their testimony. In addition, they provided corroborativetestimony for one another by coming forward. The subsequent release of the St.Clair County police dispatch tapes that captured the police officers’ commentsduring the event added a sense of realism for those people that heard them asopposed to just reading statements made by the officers. Another possible reason for the serious tone of news reports surrounding thisevent is due to the location of Scott Air Force Base (AFB) in proximity to thesightings. Most reporters probably suspected these officers witnessed somemilitary black project associated with Scott AFB. So in their minds, the UFO wasnot thought of in terms of possible extraterrestrial visitation. Rather, it wasmore than likely a covert military operation. This was easier to digest for thereporters and their audiences. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch of January 9th, 2000 ran an article entitled“Police officers in St. Clair County report seeing early-morning UFO.” Thearticle reviewed the overall series of events as we have previously discussed.Specifically, the reporter interviewed Millstadt, Illinois police officer CraigStevens. The article included a photo of his sketch of the UFO and his Polaroidphoto. As mentioned, the police officers had nothing to gain by reporting their UFOsightings. To bolster this, the Post-Dispatch article begins by stating “In thepast few days, Millstadt police Officer Craig Stevens has slept little, takencountless phone messages from national experts and heard all of the little greenmen jokes his fellow officers can muster.” Perhaps the officers did gainsomething as a result of speaking up – a big headache. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch ran a subsequent news article in their January12th edition entitled “UFO sighting brings media attention, investigative teamto Southern Illinois.” A subtitle to the article stated “Credibility ofwitnesses piques interest.” This article focused primarily on the Highland,Illinois witness, Melvern Noll. It also discussed out-of-State investigatorsdescending on the area to investigate the case. Most importantly, it provided amap showing the sequence of sightings and corresponding flight path of the UFO. On the Illinois side of the Mississippi River, local newspapers werepublishing their own accounts of this major UFO sighting. The January 12thedition of the Waterloo Republic-Times ran a story entitled “UFO bafflesobservers” with the subtitle “Large, lighted object cruises the Metro Eastskies.” The article begins by asking its readers a question: “What is shapedlike an arrowhead, as big as a football field, two stories tall and flies slowlythrough the air? If you don’t know, don’t feel bad. People across the Metro Eastsaw an object fitting that description float overhead early last Wednesdaymorning, and no one yet has been able to explain what it was.” In New Baden, another newspaper, the Clinton County News, ran a story onJanuary 13th entitled “Lebanon Officer Witnesses UFO.” This article obviouslyfocused on an interview with Officer Ed Barton who gave a highly-detailedaccount of his sighting to the newspaper. The serious nature of the article,like those previously published, was devoid of any sarcasm or levity. The same day the O’Fallon Progress ran coverage as well in an articleentitled “What could it have been? Unidentified object invades area skies.” Thisarticle also provided an overview of the sighting reports, but more importantlyinterviewed the Public Affairs Director at Scott AFB. According to their Public Affairs Officer (PAO), they “did not receive anyofficial calls regarding the UFO sighting in the installation area.” Inaddition, “The base has received no reports or calls from military or civilianswho live or work on Scott.” Further, “None of the base’s 24-hour agencies, theSecurity Police, medical personnel, fire department or emergency servicesreported seeing the object that evening.” In reference to radar at the base, the PAO added “The base runway and controltower are not 24-hour-a-day facilities. The base also has no radar but relies onthe FAA radar approach system at Lambert International Airport. The tower wasclosed at the time of the sighting and no aircraft were in the air.” He added,“Later that morning, Scott (AFB) began receiving calls from the media solicitinginformation about the UFO sighting.” Whether the PAO was simply misquoted or incorrect, there are a couple oferrors in these statements that must be highlighted. First, let’s examine thecomment “The base also has no radar but relies on the FAA radar approach systemat Lambert International Airport.” It is true that Lambert has overallresponsibility for air traffic in the greater St. Louis area including ScottAFB. What is not true is that Scott AFB “has no radar.” Anyone can drive by thebase and see the air control tower and their rotating radar array. Scott AirForce Base has radar. In fact, we will learn more about this in the nextchapter. The other error relates to the base initially receiving word about the UFO.The PAO stated “Later that morning, Scott AFB began receiving calls from themedia soliciting information about the UFO sighting.” This bares similarities tothe statement in their letter of response to my FOIA request. However, thiscomment is simply not accurate or true. On the St. Clair County dispatch tapes at 4:21 am, Officer Ed Barton ofLebanon is heard requesting of Central Command “If you would, would you contactScott Air Force Base and see if they have anything flying within this areaplease?” At this point Central Command contacted Scott AFB to notify them of thesituation and inquired about any potential military aircraft in the area. ScottAFB informed them they knew of nothing. It is at this point in those earlymorning hours, while events were still in motion, that Scott AFB was firstnotified of something unusual. It was not, as the PAO stated, “later thatmorning” when reporters began calling them. Were these statements simple errors or outright deception? I will let you bethe judge. Regardless, I do believe officials at Scott AFB knew more than theywere sharing with the public. If the eyewitness accounts are true and anunidentified flying object was sighted within 1 to 2 miles of the base, we areleft with two basic scenarios. One scenario is that this was some type of top secret military aircraft thatthe Air Force refused to acknowledge. This is the most practical explanation andone whose secrecy I could respect. The second is that this was not a military vehicle and was completely foreignto military officials. If this scenario is true, the implications are chilling.A genuine UFO flew by a major military installation and caught the militarycompletely by surprise to the point where no overt defensive response wasinitiated. I make this statement since no one reported seeing jet interceptorsor any other military aircraft dispatched to identify / intercept the object. Again, when examining this case alone, the covert military aircraft seems themost tenable explanation. However, no UFO case exists in a vacuum. Anywell-documented case should be examined in the overall context of other casesand historical reports. This is no different than a crime being investigated bylaw enforcement and then compared to similar crimes in their database to lookfor any potential patterns or leads. In the years that followed the January 5th, 2000 incident, I adopted thissame approach. The evidence I later uncovered and present in this book, wouldstrongly argue against the military explanation and favors the alternatehypothesis – a genuine UFO. Chapter 2:New Information, New Insights As the year 2000 marched onward, interest in the Illinois UFO case did notwaver. In fact, shortly after my initial investigation, I was contacted by theMUFON International Director at the time, Walt Andrus. I had met with Walt on anumber of occasions at various UFO conferences in the past and was happy to hearfrom him. He had received my reports on this case at MUFON headquarters andrequested that I write an article about it for the MUFON UFO Journal. I washappy to oblige and it was the cover story of the March 2000 issue that year. During this same time, UFO enthusiasts and skeptics began the usualback-and-forth discussion/argument over what the origin of this object mighthave been. Most of those on the skeptical end of the spectrum attributed thesightings to some top secret military aircraft. The UFO enthusiasts contemplatedthe possibility of it being a genuine extra-terrestrial vehicle of some kind. One of the most outlandish explanations put forth was that the object seen onJanuary 5th, 2000 was simply the planet Venus that was mistaken for a UFO! Thisexplanation was vocalized by none other than the late UFO skeptic, Philip J.Klass who was well-known within UFO circles for decades as “the” UFO skeptic. Hewas also a senior aviation editor for Aviation Week & Space Technology magazinefor over thirty years. When objectively viewed, some of his criticisms over theyears in respect to UFO cases were warranted. However, most would argue that thevast majority of his explanations simply did not fit well with the details of acase. I was in communication with Phil right after the UFO incident over southernIllinois. He had contacted me to gather information on the case. Despite thenegative experiences many UFO investigators have had with Phil, I must admitthat he was always very courteous and polite in his dealings with me. However,that being said, I did not agree at all with Phil’s assessment of this case. In his Skeptics UFO Newsletter (SUN) dated March 2000, Klass went into alengthy lecture on how the planet Venus has been misidentified by many so-calledUFO eyewitnesses. This is factually accurate. I have personally investigatedcases where the reporting witness claims to see a UFO when, upon closerexamination, it turns out to be the planet Venus. Oftentimes, this occurs whenVenus is low on the horizon where refraction occurs that distorts/magnifies itsactual appearance. Towards the end of his article, Phil had a final notation entitled “WillVenus explanation for Illinois UFO be accepted?” He stated “SUN predicts thatthe Venus explanation for the Illinois UFO will be rejected by many, if not all,of the ‘witnesses,’… and by many UFO researchers. Very rarely are personswilling to admit that they mistook a bright planet for a UFO. Additionally, manyof the Illinois UFO witnesses have now become local celebrities as a result ofmedia coverage and their appearance on radio-TV shows, including the famous ArtBell talk show.” I have no problem with the Venus explanation for some UFO sightings. However,when the witnesses observe the UFO traversing the sky from the northeast tosouthwest in minutes or seconds; when one witness hears a humming sound comingfrom the object; when multiple officers see the object blotting out stars as itmoves overhead, we need to look elsewhere for a viable explanation. One finalimportant fact to note is that Venus didn’t begin to rise over theEast-Southeastern horizon on January 5th, 2000 until a full thirty minutes afterthe first sighting by an eyewitness who was looking to the Northeast! In his follow-up SUN issue of May 2000, Klass acknowledged the fact thatVenus was scheduled to rise after the initial witness had his sighting. Hestated this ruled out this particular sighting as being triggered by Venus, butleft the insinuation the other eyewitness reports may have involved the planet.He also highlighted earlier in the newsletter my investigative report publishedby MUFON. Shortly after my article was published, I was contacted by veteran UFOresearcher, Lou Farish, who requested that I attend his Ozark UFO Conference inEureka Springs, Arkansas that April to discuss this UFO event. Again, I was morethan willing to share my insights into the case, despite having no solidexplanations for the sightings. That April, I stood before 400+ conferenceattendees to lecture on the case. This was the first public discussion otherthan the local St. Louis area news broadcasts in the days immediately followingthe sightings of January 5th. This was also my first public lecture on the subject of UFOs. Despite beingenthusiastic to discuss the case, I was a bit nervous. However, the positiveresponse and keen interest on the part of the audience demonstrated to me thesignificance of this case in the history of UFOlogy. Up until this time, I wasbusy interviewing, writing, and analyzing the raw reports. Now, I was able tosee first-hand the level of interest this case generated with people at large. I discussed the sequence of events based on my interviews and showed a slideshow of various locations where witnesses were positioned at the time of theirsightings. I also showed a map of the area and discussed the apparent flightpath of the object based on the eyewitness testimony. In addition, I discussedthe location of Scott Air Force Base in relation to the sightings. I stated that I found it hard to believe that the Air Force was ignorant ofthe events of that morning given the proximity of the UFO to the Air Base. Inaddition, I shared the letter of response to my inquiries from the base’s PublicInformation Office that indicated all radar is handled by the Federal AviationAdministration (FAA) out of Lambert International Airport in nearby St. Louis,Missouri. At the time, I felt this was an attempt to deflect attention away fromthe military base and their radar system. After concluding my conference lecture, I began to step away from thespeaker’s podium. Immediately a middle-aged man grabbed my arm and spoke in myear “If you have questions about radar in this case, I can assist you. I workfor the FAA and helped install the radar systems at Lambert InternationalAirport.” He then proceeded to give me his FAA business card as if to validatewhat he was telling me. Needless-to-say, I was taken aback being confronted by arepresentative of the FAA at a UFO conference. Those not well-acquainted withthe subject would be surprised to see the caliber of people that sometimesattend these UFO events. Despite other audience members clamoring around me to ask questions,eventually this man and I stepped outside the lecture hall to discuss mattersfurther. He was attending the conference in an unofficial capacity, since hepersonally had an interest in the UFO subject. His name is Richard Taylor and hehad a 38 year career with the FAA. He served as an Air Traffic Controller for 17years. Following that, he went into the Electronics Maintenance (i.e., radar andautomation) division and later served as a Technical Inspector. As mentioned, healso supervised the installation by Westinghouse of the existing radar system atLambert International Airport. Suffice-it-to-say, Richard is well-acquaintedwith radar. Richard reviewed with me the fundamentals of radar. Some of the information Iwas already familiar with while much was very enlightening. We ended ourconversation by him offering to take me to the radar facility at Lambert when itwas convenient. It should be stated up front that this was prior to the horrificterrorist attacks of 9/11 when security was much less restrictive than it istoday. Approximately one month later, I met with Richard in St. Louis. He led me tothe radar tower at Lambert International Airport where he then proceeded tointroduce me to the FAA staff that was on duty at the time. I must state thatall of the men that I met expressed a genuine interest in the January 5th, 2000UFO case. There were no snickers or snide comments made. I believe this waspartly due to the number of police officers involved as well as the localmedia’s serious attention given to the case. They asked me about the details of the event. I shared what information I hadat the time. At one point, they commented that if the UFO was flying between 500to 1,000 feet altitude as witnesses stated, the object may have been flyingbelow their radar. Richard chimed in at this point. He stated that he previouslyinformed me that the radar data would no longer be available due to the FAApolicy of recycling the recordings every 14 days. They stated that was indeedthe case. As Richard led me back downstairs, we passed their break room. We brieflystepped in so he could introduce me to one more gentlemen who was on breakwatching the History Channel on TV as I remember. Introductions were made andthe subject of lost radar data was mentioned again. Immediately, this man toldRichard that the data still existed. He said that it was “pulled” due to arequest from an “outside agency.” To this day, we are not sure which “agency”requested the data. This conversation led Richard to make subsequent inquiries and he trackeddown the man who saved the data upon receiving this earlier request. He was alsoable to secure a copy of it for me as well. This he provided along with thenecessary software to view it. Amazingly, I now had the radar data from themorning of January 5th, 2000! Upon processing the data with Richard’s assistance, we were able to plot thelatitude and longitude coordinates of the eyewitnesses and had specific times oftheir sightings as provided by the time stamps on the St. Clair County policedispatch tapes. From an investigative standpoint, it doesn’t get much betterthan this! Despite having viewed the data dozens of times and factoring in multiplevariables and filters, we found no radar targets that matched the locationcoordinates and times of the witness sightings. This was disappointing but didnot in any way invalidate the case. Again, as my FAA friends alluded to on myrecent visit, if the estimates of altitude were fairly accurate, their radar maynot have detected the object due to being obscured by the terrain between theradar site at Lambert and the UFO. Again, my attention was drawn to Scott Air Force Base. Despite LambertAirport having overall jurisdiction over air space around the greater St. Louisarea including Scott, they have their radar array located in St. Louis. Scotthas a radar array as well and it was much closer to the flight path of theobject (estimated one to two miles). However, according to official sources,their radar was down for routine maintenance at that time. As mentioned in thelast chapter, the Public Affairs Officer even reportedly stated they did nothave radar! This raises an interesting question: Did the operators of this object knowthe radar was non-functional at the time and take advantage of this opportunityto make a flyby of the military base? Is it coincidental that this remarkableevent occurred during this limited window of opportunity? Regardless of who wasoperating the craft (i.e., human or otherwise), this aspect of the case is mostintriguing. Richard Taylor informed me that we have the ability to monitoractive radar frequencies or lack thereof in any given area. Why couldn’t othersdo it? Regardless, it doesn’t answer the question as to who was operating thiscraft. It simply speaks to the timing of the event. Over the subsequent years, this case began to garner additional mediaattention. Numerous production teams descended upon the witnesses to interviewand re-create the events of that early January morning for their televisionaudiences. At the same time, the internet was rampant with speculation on thepart of skeptics and UFO believers alike regarding what truly occurred in theskies of southern Illinois. Despite the confusing and often misleading statements and documentaries madeabout this UFO-related event, the most objective and accurate portrayal of thislandmark case was created by my friend and colleague, Darryl Barker who not onlyinterviewed the initial series of eyewitnesses that came forward, butincorporated his interviews and research into a 30-minute independentdocumentary film entitled The Edge of Reality: Illinois UFO, January 5th, 2000. While I initially focused on the primary eyewitnesses and then later delvedinto historical research regarding triangular UFOs, Darryl developed a websitededicated to the case and continued to receive emails from individuals claimingfirst or second-hand knowledge of the UFO seen over Illinois in January 2000.Due to his continual efforts in documenting additional eyewitness testimony, Iasked Darryl to share his findings. What follows are some of the most intriguingaspects of his interviews and hard work over the last 13 years in his own words: > Before discussing my investigation of the January 5, 2000 Illinois UFO case, I> would like to thank David Marler for his paramount work on the UFO subject> made possible by his tireless labor and focused energy. He is devoted to the> understanding of an elusive phenomenon that has fascinated millions of people> around the world for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.> I cannot recount how many times I’ve been informed by a wide array of people> that what the January 5, 2000 UFO witnesses actually saw was - anything but a> genuine unidentified flying object.> After observing the gauntlet of media attention the January 5th witnesses> received, it is easy to understand why any person who valued their livelihood,> self-esteem, and sanity would be reticent to become the main attraction in the> UFO-media circus.

What he observed on the> morning of January 5th, 2000 would be a first in terms of a new parameter to> assess the assumed flight path of what was assumed to be a single UFO that> morning. Remaining anonymous, we will refer to him as “Mr. C.”> Mr. C was on his way home from a distant job location and had traveled north> in Illinois where he had just arrived at the intersection of Interstate 64 and> Highway 4, which is situated just east of Mid-America Airport and Scott Air> Force Base. Mr. C exited the interstate and was turning north on Highway 4> when he noticed at about 200 feet altitude, two red lights. His initial> impression was that they might be radio tower lights.

His description was that of> a “flying house” and he provided this description in a cell phone call he made> to his wife which awakened her at roughly 4:10 a.m. - 4:15 a.m. Mr. C stopped> his truck on the side of Highway 4 and watched the “box” as it came to a> stationary position just east of him. As he watched it, he continued to give a> play-by-play to his wife who was now on the phone with him.

The> triangle was no more than 500 feet altitude and was also flashing red lights> that were located on the tips of the triangle. After this exchange, the> triangle made a flat, pivoting turn and moved to the west/southwest.> Turning back to the “box,” Mr. C then had a profound feeling that he was being> watched.

Mr. C observed two separate UFOs: one a> distinct triangle and the other being a rectangular box. The effort made to> rationalize Melvern Noll’s box-shaped “flying house” as a triangle seen from> the side may no longer be a viable notion.

However, even within the triangular reports, there are> variations in the descriptions. It may be possible that there was more than> one type of triangular craft over the area as well, leading to a scenario more> complex than previously thought.

It is not every day that a small flotilla of UFOs cruises by a major> Air Force Base. At least, not that we know of… Again, I am indebted to Darryl Barker for generously providing his additionaleyewitness material. I have found Darryl to be extremely objective anddetailed-oriented in his investigation. His methodical approach to examining theevidence is only rivaled by his tenacity towards unraveling this mystery. He notonly is a good colleague, but a great and dear friend. Those interested in hisresearch are encouraged to visit his website: www.dbarkertv.com for furtherinformation. This newest testimony offered by “Mr. C” illustrates how difficult it is toclose an investigation into a UFO case. You never know when new information maypresent itself. Despite exhaustive investigations on the part of Darryl and Ispanning the last thirteen years, here we are faced with new and compellingtestimony. It should be mentioned that Darryl has had many people offer uppurported testimony to UFO sightings that Darryl did not deem credible based onone reason or another. After multiple interviews, Darryl found “Mr. C” to beconcise, clear, and consistent in his testimony. “Mr. C” also has impeccablecredentials relating to a former job position he once held that adds to hisoverall credibility. Beyond the aspects of this new witness’ character, of significance is histestimony and how it weaves into the narrative previously discussed regardingJanuary 5th, 2000. Never publicly discussed, Darryl and I had issues trying toresolve Officer Lopinot’s sighting in O’Fallon with that of Officer Barton andOfficer Martin in Lebanon and Shiloh respectively. Specifically, when the UFOreportedly shot away to the southwest as reported by Barton, it was then sightedby Officer Martin. However, when examining the direction of flight described byBarton, this did not correspond with the location of Officer Martin assumingthere was a linear flight path involved. Rather, it would have placed the UFO inthe exact location of where “Mr. C” reported his triangular UFO sighting. Again,this was never made public and “Mr. C” would have no way of knowing this. Finally, if we examine Officer Lopinot’s testimony, he indicated the UFOdeparted towards the town of Shiloh, Illinois. Taking into account his UFO’sreported direction of departure, this would have placed the UFO in the exactlocation of Officer Martin’s sighting directly across Interstate 64 to thesouthwest. Following the information as it has been presented, we are now forcedto conclude there appears to have been at least three separate UFOs in thevicinity of Scott Air Force Base on the morning of January 5th, 2000 (see map). [images/00005.jpg] For those that have difficulty accepting the notion of a solitary UFO flyingin proximity to Scott Air Force Base, this new scenario may truly stretchcredulity. However, as we will explore later in this book, there is a richhistory of these sighting reports. Specifically, accounts showing a pattern ofmultiple triangular UFOs being sighted together and rectangular UFOs being seenwith them as well. As you will soon see, the events of January 5th, 2000 werenot unique. In addition to the eyewitnesses described by Darryl, I was also contacted byothers who claim to have observed the UFO around the same timeframe. In fact,two separate groups of eyewitnesses claim to have seen the same triangularobject in southern Illinois the night of January 4th, 2000 – hours prior to theinitial sightings starting around 4:00 a.m. on January 5th. One group waslocated in the town of Litchfield, Illinois (located approximately 42 milesnorth of Highland) and the other was located in the town of Millstadt (whereOfficer Craig Stevens would later report his UFO). Unfortunately, both lead witnesses in these instances failed to meet forface-to-face interviews and ceased communication with me. Either they decidedthey did not want any undue publicity or they were not truthful in their initialreporting. Many UFO investigations involve witnesses who seem open initially todiscussion, but who then later change their minds. I only mention this since itmay imply UFO-related events occurring in the area outside the originallyconceived timeframe between 4:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. Likewise, additional people stepped forward to claim they saw the objectafter this same initial timeframe. One such witness was a man near Frank HoltenState Park in East St. Louis, Illinois. He claims to have observed the object inthe southwest sky around 7:00 a.m. on January 5th – two hours after the lastpolice sighting in Dupo, Illinois. One witness, who later came forward to a mutual friend of ours, allowed me tointerview him. This man is a private pilot. In January 2000, he had a planehoused in a hangar in Columbia, Illinois located seven miles west of Millstadt.Based on his location and testimony, he may have observed the UFO between thetime Officer Stevens (Millstadt) and Officer Jany (Dupo) saw the UFO. Whatfollows are excerpts of my interview with him. I have changed his name toprotect his identity. > “My name is John and I have an airplane down in Columbia, Illinois. I was> working late over at my hangar. I had just left the hangar. I had noticed that> there was something in the sky and it was pretty bright and pretty big. I> (could) see a large triangular-shaped object. It was probably around 2,000> feet in the air or maybe a little lower. It is kind of hard to tell at night.> It was hovering and it wasn’t moving very fast (when it did move). It made no> sound whatsoever. And it had lights on the tips that I could tell of the> object. I watched it move to the north. It was between Old Route 3 and the> Mississippi River. I don’t know how big this thing was, but it was huge! It> looked like the size of a football field. It was huge!> I watched it five to ten minutes. It moved kind of abruptly, but not too fast.> It didn’t bank when it turned. It was horizontal. It stayed horizontal when it> made its turns. It was kind of an abrupt movement, but no sound whatsoever. I> watched it for a while until it kind of disappeared. I didn’t know if we were> under attack or what was going on because I had never seen anything like this> thing before. It was following (Interstate) 255 (in its flight path heading> south to north). Like I said, that was some years ago, but I can distinctly> remember it. I will never forget it!” I then asked him how many years he was a pilot at the time of the sighting.He indicated he was a pilot for seven years in 2000. I then inquired of himthat, as a pilot, how was he interpreting what he was observing? His reply wasto the point. He stated: > “I really didn’t know what I was seeing because I had never seen anything that> big in the air! And that’s what really kind of terrified me in a sense because> it didn’t make any noise and, like I said, it was huge! I really didn’t know> what to think about it! It was moving slowly and it wasn’t hurting anything.> But, there again, I just observed it. Obviously, somebody would know about it> somewhere because you’re not going to be able to hide something that huge in a> hangar.” I then asked him about any subsequent conversations he had with fellow-pilotsor others after the morning of January 5th, 2000. His statement sheds some lighton additional police involvement and eyewitnesses. He stated: > “I did mention it to a few other police officers over there in the Dupo> (Illinois) area. They said there were some (Illinois) State Patrol people that> apparently seen this thing and followed it for awhile. So apparently there> were quite a few people that seen the same thing that I seen. Apparently, you> know, it’s not just me (as a witness). There’s something going on. It’s> unbelievable! But I will never forget that. I will never forget that!” The latest in a series of witnesses who came forward was in the summer of2012. What follows is the testimony of a man who was interviewed by Illinois andMissouri MUFON investigators. I interviewed him later and found him to be ahighly credible witness. His name is Tom Jensen and this is his story: > “I worked as a firefighter for 24 years. I was an Assistant Chief for 12 of> those years. I was also a member of the local Bomb and Arson Squad. Let’s> start by the date. Around Jan. 5, 2000 (not sure of the exact date), I was at> a nearby township investigating a house fire. Around 3:00 a.m., I walked back> to my truck to clean off all the dirt from my boots and turn out gear. I> started listening to the hand walkie-talkie two-way radio in my truck. We were> picking up radio traffic from the area dispatcher. The dispatcher was talking> to some Police cars about an object moving North West in the night sky.> After about 10 minutes, I started heading home on I-44 east bound. That’s when> I picked up our county dispatcher talking again to a Union, Missouri Police> Officer about a large black object over Hwy. 50 & Hwy. 47. I turned down Hwy.> 47 towards Union, Missouri. As I came over the hill into town I saw three> white lights about 75 feet apart from each other. In between the round white> lights there were multicolored-color lights scrolling back and forth from left> to right and back again.> I came down the hill and pulled up behind two Police Officers parked on the> side of the road. I then could see a very large triangular-shaped craft with> more lights on the bottom of the object. There was one very bright white light> in each corner and one red light in the center towards the back of the craft.> The white lights were beaming straight down.> The red light was blinking on and off like a radio tower light. I got out my> truck and started walking up to the Police Officers. One officer was from the> City of Union, Missouri the other was a Franklin County Deputy. Just as I got> up to them, the object started to move off to the northwest at a jogging pace.> The two officers got in their cars and started to chase the object.> I was unable to keep up with the two officers. They were using their overhead> lights. So, after a minute or so, I caught up to them. I got out of the truck> again and walked up to the officers. The craft had stopped again about a mile> up the road. As we were watching, the bright spotlights in each corner came> down to about 100 feet from the ground and stopped. No light beam touched the> ground. We watched the craft for about 10 minutes. Then the craft moved again.> This time, only about one half mile and stopped again. After stopping and> getting out to talk with the officers again, I noticed the County officer was> trying to talk to the dispatcher by two-way radio.

Hopefully, this will help out investigators in the future.” [images/00067.jpg]Tom Jenson’s UFO model. Of course, I am indebted to this witness for coming forward with histestimony. If true, this is an important aspect of this case that deservesrecognition. It must be emphasized the witness was not certain as to the exactdate of his sighting. He thought it was January 5th, 2000, but added it couldhave been a day or two before or after. If it did occur on January 5th thatyear, it changes the overall complexion of this case in that it further extendsthe geographic area involved. Namely, it places another triangular object a fullfifty miles further west than the initial flight path. Could we have had threeidentical UFOs operating in two separate yet nearby locales? This may stretchthe imagination, but as previously mentioned this is not an uncommon occurrenceregarding these objects. As a researcher, I was initially cautious of this testimony. The witness tooktwelve years to come forward with this report. This, of course, does notautomatically disqualify the veracity of someone’s statements. Upon interviewingthe witness, I learned that he did not wish to initially go public with hissighting due to his job position with the county. He did not wish to jeopardizehis career over a UFO sighting. However, over the years, he felt an obligationto report what he had witnessed. He stated he did not want to go to his gravewithout sharing this information with someone. I also need to address the witness’ statement about lack of media attentionon this case. This story, as previously-mentioned, was covered in the local St.Louis area newspapers and TV news for days and weeks after the event. Iacknowledge that perhaps the gentlemen simply did not see or hear of any ofthese, but it seems unlikely. Again, upon interviewing him, he clarified he wasalluding to the local Union, Missouri UFO not the Illinois reports that hadindeed garnered lots of attention."},{"pageContent":" It is difficult to logically resolve the time estimate and geographicdistance of fifty miles. The witness indicated he first heard the police radiotransmissions from Illinois around 3:00 a.m. This would be a full hour beforethe first eyewitness, Melvern Noll, sighted the UFO let alone reported it toauthorities. As far as the distance is concerned, we are looking at an estimatedfifty miles outside the initially established flight path of the object. Giventhe observed acceleration rates of the UFO, this in itself may not seem thatoutlandish. However, with the population density of the greater St. Louis areaeven at that early hour of the morning, it would be more plausible if we had oneor more witnesses who claim to have seen the object anywhere between southernIllinois and Union, Missouri. This would help piece these disparate episodestogether. Again though, are we faced with the ever-growing possibility there was morethan one UFO cavorting about the night skies around St. Louis, Missouri? If thisis the case, the similarities between the Illinois and Union, Missouri objectscannot be a coincidence. If two or more identical objects of unknown origin wereoperating in this area, they must have been doing so as part of a coordinatedoperation. But what operation was being conducted? In reference to the Union, Missouri case, the best we could hope for is thatthe police officers referenced in the report would come forward and beinterviewed. Their testimony could bolster this man’s report and add to itsvalidity. I include it to illustrate the subsequent eyewitness testimony that Ireceived. It should be noted that this witness from the Union, Missouri area did notbelieve in UFOs prior to his sighting. He told me point blank that he thoughtthose who reported UFOs were crazy people. Since January 2000, he has beenforced to reevaluate his stance on the subject. Initially, he thought what hewitnessed was some type of military craft. Over the years, he has heard of otherreports made worldwide and is unsure as to the origin of these objects. Despite his uncertainty as to their origin, this has not stopped him fromruminating about the sighting in the subsequent years. His interest reached apoint where he began creating three dimensional illuminated models of the UFO inquestion. Luckily, this witness is extremely talented in the area of woodworkingand was able to fashion very detailed models to illustrate his sighting. One ofthe models he generously presented to me in 2013 when he learned of my researchand upcoming book. Despite the dramatic nature of these sightings by credible witnesses coupledwith the subsequent media coverage that refrained from ridiculing the eyewitnessreports, I was stunned by the lack of concern on the part of those who lived inthe flight path of the object(s). Again, most people I spoke with at the timedid not discount that these witnesses saw something. Of course, no one had aconclusive answer. However, most people assumed it was something military inorigin. If the reports could be attributed to some type of experimental militaryaircraft, why would these be test flown over populated areas when there arelocations elsewhere designated for this purpose? Based on the eyewitnessreports, the object(s) did not operate with characteristics indicative ofconventional jet aircraft. Therefore, we must ask ourselves, “What type ofpropulsion technology was being utilized?” More importantly, the questionremains, “What type of materials or byproducts (e.g., radiation) may thepopulace have been exposed to as a result of this object operating 1,000 feetover their homes?” I consider this to be a very real and valid issue, but thoseliving in the flight path of the object(s) never voiced any concerns relating tothis. Life continued and people went back to their day-to-day activities in thewake of these incredible sightings. Certainly, cases like this illustrate the complexity of UFO investigations.As more testimony comes forward, it must be analyzed and interpreted to see howit fits into the larger framework of the case. New information leads us tore-examine previously held conclusions. What started as the sighting of asolitary UFO may have evolved into a much more complex case involving multipleUFOs operating around a major metropolitan area and military base. I later applied this same principle of re-examination to this case relativeto the history of UFO reports as a whole. Just when I thought my work was done,I found myself engaging in historical research that would consume me for yearsto come. Chapter 3:The Historical Review Begins Given the quality and volume of eyewitness testimony related to the January5th, 2000 UFO incident and the similarities between that night and the events inBelgium from 1989 to 1991, I began to wonder what other UFO reports might existthat bear striking similarities to these. Were these repeated characteristics acoincidence or was there something more here? Obviously, over the course of fifty plus years, a wealth of UFO reports hasbeen accumulated from official and unofficial sources. They vary considerablywith regard to the eyewitnesses as well as the purported unidentified objectsthemselves. Many of these exist in newspaper reports. One such report that I came across was from an article in the Wisconsin StateJournal dated April 28, 1953. The gist of the article focuses on UFO researchconducted by one of the teachers at the University of Wisconsin. HelmuthEngelman is described in the article as a “jet course instructor” for theuniversity focusing on jet engine design and propulsion characteristics. In hisspare time, he researched and lectured on the UFO subject. He related in the article that one of his “non-believer” students eventuallybecame a “believer.” He stated that the student sent him a letter some monthsback that related a bizarre encounter with an unidentified flying object whiledriving on the Pennsylvania turnpike one morning. The student is quoted assaying “It was triangular in shape, resembling the type which was first reportedover the Dutch East Indies in 1890 and which caused the great flying trianglescare in England in 1894.” At this point, let’s examine what was just stated. First, we have atriangular UFO report from 1953 as reported by this student. Based on thelimited information, we can assume this was a single-witness case, which ofcourse is not as credible as compared to a multiple witness case. However, thefact there was a report of this nature made in the year 1953 is intriguing. Moreintriguing are the references he makes to triangular UFO reports from the years1890 and 1894. How far do these reports go back historically speaking? I decidedto track these reports down. Earlier in the same newspaper article that these references were made, Inoticed a discussion on Charles Fort. For those not familiar with Mr. Fort, hewas an American who lived from 1874 to 1932. He traveled extensively and wasbest known as an author on anomalous phenomena. His most popular book being TheBook of the Damned, published in 1919. Since there was a reference to CharlesFort, perhaps the accounts of triangular UFOs in the late 1800s were taken fromhis works. In reviewing my copy of The Book of the Damned, I came across severalintriguing reports. Despite the fact they are not references to what thenewspaper article alludes to, they should be mentioned here in the context ofour discussion. One such report was taken from the publication, Nature (vol. 90 pg. 169).Fort relates that a Mr. Charles Tilden Smith of Chisbury, Wiltshire, England onApril 8, 1912 observed an unusual sight. He goes on to state that Mr. Smithdescribed it as “unlike anything that I had ever seen before. Although I havestudied the skies for many years, I have never seen anything like it.” Fort relates that what Mr. Smith observed were two stationary dark patches onthe clouds. Specifically, they were dark patches that appeared stationary onmoving clouds. In other words, the dark areas moved with the clouds so theirrelative positions did not change in relation to the clouds themselves. The mostintriguing aspect was that the dark areas were triangular in shape. This wasobserved for more than thirty minutes. Mr. Smith’s impression was that these were like “a heavy shadow cast upon athin veil of clouds by some unseen object away in the west, which wasintercepting the sun’s rays.” It is not a stretch of the imagination to assumethat two large triangular-shaped shadows were most likely caused by two largetriangular-shaped objects. Now what the objects might have been is anotherquestion. To add to the confusion, Fort relates a similar instance of sorts. This time,the appearances were observed on the surface of the moon! In Scientific American(vol. 46 pg. 49), is the account made by several observers from Lebanon,Connecticut. On the evening of July 3, 1882, these observers claimed to havewitnessed “two triangular luminous appearances” seen “on the moon’s upper limb”as Fort put it. These disappeared after a time and were replaced two darktriangular “appearances” three minutes later on the moon’s “lower limb.” Theywere seen to approach each other then meet and instantly disappear. Moststaggering were the apparent size of the images as they “seemed to be cuttingoff or obliterating nearly a quarter of its (moon’s) surface.” Again, if thenarrative isn’t compelling enough, the year of this report is – 1882. An interesting aspect with regard to these two reports is that two triangularappearances for lack of a better term in each case were reported. This willfactor into the discussion in Chapter 7 when we examine in greater detail thecommon characteristics of these reports. Despite these curious and potentially relevant reports, they are notproviding us with insight into the statements made in the Wisconsin StateJournal article of 1953. I decided to start reviewing the UFO literature priorto the year 1953 in the hopes of finding the source(s) of the references to “theDutch East Indies in 1890” and “the great flying triangle scare in England in1894.” After an extensive review of what was published regarding flying saucers upto that time, I found a reference in Donald Keyhoe’s first UFO book entitled,The Flying Saucers Are Real, published in 1950. It is this reference that Ibelieve was the basis for the statement made in the newspaper article. In chapter 7 of his book, Keyhoe wrote: > “In New Zealand, a year later, an oval-shaped disk was reported speeding high> overhead. This was on May 4, 1888. About two years after this (circa 1890),> several large aerial bodies were sighted hovering over the Dutch East Indies.> Most accounts described them as roughly triangular, about one hundred feet on> the base and two hundred feet on the sides. But some observers thought they> might be longer and narrower.” Later in the same chapter, Keyhoe stated: > “On August 26, 1894, a British admiral reported sighting a large disk with a> projection like a tail. And a year after this (1895), both England and> Scotland buzzed with stories of triangular-shaped objects like those seen in> the Dutch East Indies. Although many officials scoffed at the stories, more> than one astronomer stuck to his belief that the mysterious things might be> coming from outer space. Since planes and dirigibles were then unknown, there> was no one on Earth who could have been responsible for them.” As I continued to pursue this mystery, my curiosity was piqued even further.Again, we have reports dating from the late 19th century! More importantly, inthe reports from the Dutch East Indies, the description of size is mostimportant. Beyond triangular UFOs being reported, we have descriptions ofappreciable size. Namely, the reports clearly describe the objects as onehundred feet wide at the base and two hundred feet in overall length. Thiscorrelates with the reports from Belgium and Southern Illinois in the years1989-1991 and 2000 respectively. Is it possible we are dealing with the sameobjects despite the geographical differences and temporal difference of roughly100 years? My review of the historical material was just beginning, but if thispattern continued to be displayed as I reviewed additional reports, what were wedealing with? At this point, I would like to discuss a most intriguing first-hand reportrelayed to my dear friend and colleague, Peter Davenport, Director of TheNational UFO Reporting Center (www.ufocenter.com) based in the State ofWashington. It involves the personal account of a Mr. Holger Berg (now deceased)of a UFO sighting he had in the year 1936. Davenport’s report summary: > “One Saturday evening in October 1936, two teenage men, Mr. Holger Berg, age> 19, and his workmate, a “Mr. Peterson,” appear to have had an encounter with a> very strange, triangular-shaped, aerial craft, an event that both intrigued,> and confused, Mr. Berg to the end of his life.> The two men were employed by the U. S. Civilian Conservation Corps to help> construct a “CCC” camp in Eklutna, located approximately 27 miles northeast of> Anchorage. Having completed the final day of work of their typical six-day> work week, they two threw on their jackets, and set out from the camp, with> the intent of hitchhiking into Anchorage, a trip they already had made on> several occasions that summer.> After a mile or two of walking, hoping for a ride, they were concerned by that> fact that no vehicles had passed them on the highway, and that the temperature> was significantly lower than they had prepared for. They began to become> chilled, and they realized that they should have worn much heavier clothing> than what they had left camp with.> Consequently, they were relieved finally to see ahead of them what they> initially assumed was a single headlight on an approaching truck. However, as> the light continued to draw closer, the two lads began to suspect that it was> not a truck at all, but rather some type of peculiar aircraft that they could> not identify.> What began to trouble them is that as the object drew closer was that its> shape was that its shape was distinctly triangular, similar in appearance to> that of a flat-iron, used for ironing clothes. Moreover, it appeared to them> to be embedded in a “cloud” of blue-green light, a color they had never seen> before.> In addition, it seemed to emanate a very peculiar sound, what they perceived> to be a strange buzzing or humming. Mr. Berg averred that the sound was> similar to the sound that a turbine engine generates, when it is shut down, a> sound he later in life heard many times when he worked for The Boeing Aircraft> Company.> As the object passed almost directly over them, the two men were able to> confirm the triangular shape of the ventral surface of the craft. As it flew> away from them, the witnesses could see some type of peculiar, multi-colored> lighting on its aft end.> The two young men became so frightened by the object, at the recommendation of> Mr. Berg, they both dove into a nearby snow bank, intent on concealing> themselves from the craft. After they were convinced that the object had left> the area, they climbed out of the snow bank, and ran all the way back to camp.> Mr. Berg reported to the National UFO Reporting Center that whenever he> attempted to discuss the incident with friends or family members, they> ridiculed him and often laughed. He had not talked about the incident for> decades, when he finally reported it to the National UFO Reporting Center in> September 2000.” Due to the early date of this sighting, included below is a transcript of theactual statements made by Mr. Berg as recorded by Peter Davenport with thewitness’ kind permission: > “It was in the fall of (the year) 1936 at 27 miles out of Anchorage at a place> called Eklutna. Another fella and I were hitchhiking to town. It was kinda> stupid since the temperature was below 20 (degrees Fahrenheit). However, we> were six miles at least away from the camp. We saw this light and we said ‘Oh> boy! A truck is coming.’> Well, anyway all of a sudden we realized this thing was up in the air and we> couldn't figure out what it was and before we knew it, it was right above us> and it had kind of a blue-green light in it and it made a sound and I never> heard that sound again until I heard the first jet engine shutdown, kind of a> low whining sound. And this fella’s name was Peterson him and I dove into a> snow bank and we watched it. It passed overhead and it looked like it was> going to run right into the mountain to our right. When it got to the> mountain, this thing went over the top and down the other side. And we said> ‘That does it! We’re going back!’ We don't know what it was. But we thought it> was something secret the government was doing.> It looked like it was cigar-shaped. However, as it got away from us, it looked> more like a flat iron. You know it (was) wider at the back than it was at the> front. I'm sure that we had that in our sites (for) over 3 minutes. Cause it> was not moving very fast and it was less than 1000 feet. And this is the part> that really frightened us. When I think about it, there may have been more> than one light but it was one blue-green light or maybe a couple of them> either on the sides or on the top. I was too rattled to really, you know> (process it all). And my response was to Peterson was ‘God! Dive into the> snow! I think it's going to crash!’> We were looking at the side of it. And as it passed...as it got away...it> looked wider at the back than it did (appear) at the front. The sound that> came from it was nothing like they had in those days. Those were all piston> engines. And like I said the sound reminded me of when the pilot shuts down a> turbine. It had a kind of a whining sound until it finally peters out. And> that's the sound that I heard. And I'm sure Peterson heard it to.” So here is an early first-hand account of a triangular UFO sighting from1936. Despite the fact it was reported many years later, it cannot be completelyignored, since we have established that earlier accounts have been documentedprior to this one. As I have learned, any one case should not be accepted atface-value as “fact,” but when one examines the cumulative body of reports, weshould at least suspend our disbelief and look more closely at the data ratherthan simply dismiss it out-of-hand. This brings us to a number of early newspaper reports. I have drawn from myown extensive collection of UFO news clippings as well as from a number ofnewspaper archives to bring these to you. Compared to most conventional reportsposted on the internet where often they are anonymous, these early newspaperarticles provide more credible information. By that, I mean we can establish thewitness is who they state they are, since newspapers would usually verify thesource of the story prior to publishing it. In addition, with the earliernewspaper accounts, they would often include the name and address of thewitnesses referenced in the article. One early example is included below from1950 in its entirety: [images/00029.jpg] We can look at another newspaper report from the early 1950s that illustratesthis. In this instance, the object in-question is described as a “flyingarrowhead.” The report is from The Daily Gazette in Berkley, California datedJanuary 6, 1953. The article’s title tells the story quite well: “SaucersOutmoded: Texans Sight Flying Arrowhead.” The incident occurred over Dallas,Texas beginning at 3:00 a.m. (CST) and lasted a total of two hours. The basicdescription was arrowhead-shaped with a green nose and wings that gave off awhite light. The object was further described as emitting a whirring noise. Witnesses included police officers as well as citizens who were calling toreport their sightings. Police contacted the air control tower at Love Field andpersonnel there were observing the object as well. Wyle Moore was the on-dutycontroller and stated when he first saw the object he estimated it was at 30,000feet altitude. He stated the object appeared to increase in altitude over timefrom 80,000 to 100,000 feet. Then he stated it was out of visual range. Rumorsof an attempted military jet intercept were mentioned, but could not besubstantiated. Whether or not the military were involved in this incident, as we shall seein Chapter 6, the military does have an extensive history of involvement withthese elusive triangles. To briefly illustrate this, we need only look atanother encounter with a triangular UFO that occurred just three months afterthe event over Dallas, Texas. This event was chronicled in The Kingsport News in Kingsport, Tennessee, onApril 20, 1953. The title of the article was “Four Airmen Spot ‘Discs’ OverKorea.” Despite the article alluding to multiple UFOs being sighted over theactive military area traveling at super-sonic speeds in the last few days, itfocused on one particular incident on the Korean Western Front. The article stated: > “At approximately 1:00 p.m. today (Sunday) aerial observers in two separate> planes flying routine reconnaissance missions, observed a white, rounded,> delta-shaped object.” We have yet again another descriptive term for these> triangular objects: ‘delta-shaped.’ The article continues by saying “It was> traveling between 60 and 80 miles per hour in a vibrating motion. The course> of the flight was from north-northwest to south-southwest over enemy> territory.” Korea is not alone when it comes to reports of triangular UFOs over theyears. The following year, a wave of triangular UFO reports swept Germany. AnInternational News Service (INS) wire story dated July 3, 1954 is quoted asstating “Three hundred West Berliners were reported today to have seen threetriangular-shaped flying saucers on several occasions during the past few weeks.Rudolf Hermes, a director of Tempelhof Airport in Berlin, said all the witnessesdescribed the objects as shiny.” Witnesses also claimed the “saucers” seemed topull away with tremendous speed and in a zigzag motion. The article closed bysaying “American and British officials have begun an investigation.” This is oneof the earliest references to military investigations of triangular UFOs. It should come as no surprise that military officials from the United Statesand Britain were interested in these reports enough to launch an investigation.This case alone cites “three hundred” Germans who were witness to, not one, butthree triangular UFOs! This case, in conjunction with the ones we have alreadydiscussed, should make any government and, more specifically, military stand upand take notice. Perhaps the investigation was not launched because of what occurred in theskies over Berlin, but because of what transpired just four days prior over theCanadian region of Goose Bay, Labrador on June 29, 1954, where anothertriangular UFO was sighted. This time, it was witnessed by eleven crew membersof a British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Stratocruiser and most of thefifty-one passengers for a full eighteen minutes. The flight had departed New York City at 5:00 p.m. EST en route to London.Its flight path took it up the East Coast of the United States to Goose Baywhich was a refueling stop prior to crossing the Atlantic. It was 9:05 p.m.Labrador time and they were flying level at 19,000 feet when the pilot, CaptainJames Howard, first observed something strange in the sky. Captain Howard stated that, at first, he saw what looked like “anindeterminate dark blob in the distance with six smaller blobs dancingattendance on it.” Howard drew the attention of his First Officer, Lee Boyd, tothe objects. Both men were unsure what they were observing. At this point theobjects were stretched out in a line parallel to their flight path. As theyobserved the array of objects, the larger one was in the center of the line withthe smaller ones lined up three in front and three behind. They likened it to abattleship with escort ships. As though this was not fascinating enough, they then noticed the main objectbegan to change shape. While this was occurring, they noticed the smallerobjects were moving as well. In fact, they had the impression that the smallerobjects were entering and exiting the main object and, in fact, there may havebeen more than six attendant objects total. They notified Goose Bay ApproachControl of their situation. No other air traffic was detected on radar accordingto Goose Bay, but they were going to see about dispatching a jet fighter toidentify the objects. During all of this, crew members began filing into thecockpit to get a better look and discuss amongst themselves what they wereseeing. Howard then noted the main object changed from a pear-shape to that of “anenormous delta-wing plane turning in to close with us.” The object seemed togrow larger as though closing on the Stratocruiser, but then the delta-wingappearance changed yet again to that of a “giant telephone receiver lying on itsback in the sky.” Due to the nature of the main object continually changing,Captain Howard would later refer to the UFO as a “flying jellyfish.” Manysubsequent newspaper articles included interviews and illustrations based onHoward’s initial sketches made during the time of the sighting. This one istaken from the Daily Mail Reporter in London dated July 2, 1954. [images/00046.jpg] Captain Howard stated the object looked as large as an ocean liner. Still,the smaller objects cavorted around the main one in various positions. Theentire cluster of objects including the main one always appeared to maintain thesame altitude and flight speed as that of the passenger plane which afforded thepassengers optimal viewing. Across the radio speaker came the voice of a jet interceptor pilot who wasclosing on their position. He asked if the objects were still visible andCaptain Howard confirmed this. The interceptor pilot stated he was approximatelytwenty miles distant from their current location. Then Howard noticed thesmaller attendant objects had suddenly disappeared. He asked his crew where thesmaller objects had gone. The navigator, George Allen, stated “It looked to meas though they went inside the big one.” Then the main object began todramatically shrink in size and appeared to be departing rapidly. The jetinterceptor never made visual or radar contact. However, the object had kept pace with the Stratocruiser for eighty miles oftheir journey for a full eighteen minutes. Twenty minutes after the objectsdisappeared, the plane landed safely at Goose Bay. The crew was met by a UnitedStates Air Force Intelligence Officer and they were interviewed about the eventsof that evening. As in the case of Berlin four days later, the United Statesmilitary was interested in investigating the report. The Labrador sightinggenerated numerous newspaper headlines around the world. One final note regarding the Labrador incident involves veteran UFOinvestigator and author, Leonard Cramp. Mr. Cramp wrote an article for the veryfirst issue of Flying Saucer Review in the spring of 1955. The article, entitled“Mystery Over Labrador,” attempted to lay out the details of this sighting andmake sense out of what exactly the witnesses had observed. One of Cramp’s finalanalyses was that the main object was, in fact, a large triangular craft thatserved as a “mother ship” with the smaller “scout ships” suspected of beingdisc-shaped, based on Cramp’s analysis of Captain Howard’s sketches andtestimony. According to Cramp, the differences in sizes and shapes reported wereattributed to the relative positions of the objects changing over time andviewing the same objects from different angles. Regardless of the finalinterpretation, the Labrador case will remain one of the great UFO events of alltime. However, Canada was not finished with triangular UFOs before the year 1954concluded. On December 27th, the Toronto Telegram ran a story entitled: “FlyingTriangle Hovers Over Cobalt.” The object reportedly hovered over the AgaunicoMine for five hours. The night watchman of the mine had indicated the object wasvery close to the ground and light from the object was so intense it almostblinded him. Another witness stated the light was as bright as a photographer’sflash bulb. Other witnesses were interviewed in the article and all agreed theobject was low, bright, stationary, and triangular in appearance. One witnessstated “Then it started to go up and down slowly, then shot high into the sky ata tremendous speed. Fantastic. Just fantastic.” It should be noted that this incident over the Agaunico Mine was just one ina series of UFO sightings that occurred in that general area years before andafterwards. These have been well-documented by Michel M. Deschamps and hiscivilian organization, Northern Ontario UFO Research & Study (NOUFORS). Manyhistorical newspaper clippings are listed on their website: www.noufors.com. Speaking of civilian UFO organizations, one of the first groups in the UnitedStates was The Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) which was foundedin 1952 by Coral and Jim Lorenzen. Their publication, the APRO Bulletin,discussed two separate triangular UFO incidents in their August 1955 issue. The first involved Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. This wasthe home of the United States Air Force Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC)which was the nerve center for their UFO investigations. As the APRO Bulletinreports, on March 30, 1955 “a triangular-shaped object of silver color hoveredover this Air Base for about 15 minutes early one morning. (It was) reported onthe 8:00 a.m. newscast, but never mentioned again.” The article continues bystating the primary witness was a friend of an APRO member who was riding a buspast the base when she and the majority of other passengers observed it. The second incident occurred on August 11, 1955 in Cairo, Illinois. A femaleresident, who wished to remain anonymous, observed a triangular-shaped objectaround 9:30 p.m. The article is quoted as saying “The front end of the objectwas dark, middle part was bluish green, and the rear of the object was verybright. (It was) seen low on the horizon above the trees, heading north andslightly west. There was no sound, trail, and the light of the object was nothazy, but rather ‘brighter than the sun’, as the observer described it. The ladysaid the object appeared to be about ten times as long as the width of thecrossbar of a TV antenna in the neighborhood.” It is interesting to note the description of the light being so bright. It issimilar in-nature to the Cobalt report from the previous year. Also, theapparent size of the object could best be defined as large when taking intoconsideration the comparison of “ten times the width of the crossbar of a TVantenna” for those of us old enough to remember those now-outdated items. A year later, APRO published another report in their September 1956 issue ofthe APRO Bulletin. They quote excerpts from the Daily Missoulian newspaper fromMissoula, Montana dated September 5, 1956. The article discusses a number of UFOsightings in the area, but focused on one primary sighting report involving atriangular UFO. The article is quoted as saying “Meanwhile, citizens stillspeculated on the object sighted over Pattee Canyon near Kalispell, Montana onthe 3rd of September. Described as triangular in shape with a bright yellowglow, it was an important enough sighting for the Helena, Montana Filter Centerto summon jet aircraft to investigate.” The article goes into detail mentioninga number of military personnel who observed the object. Then the article states“Although Air Force and civilian officials watched the object, it was not pickedup on radar. When jets came in at 12:45 a.m. and witnesses observed that as theaircraft closed in, the object faded and, as they drew away, the lightbrightened again.” Was this an example of intelligent control and a directresponse to our aircraft approaching? Despite the intriguing nature of this report, the fact remains that multiplemilitary witnesses observed it for more than three hours. Also, that the jetinterceptors dispatched were unable to identify the object. A spokesman for theMontana State University astronomy department stated the object was, in theiropinion, the planet Mars. I leave it up to the reader to decide. Four months later in Ashby, Minnesota, another triangular UFO was sighted.This report was taken from the Daily Journal from Fergus Falls, Minnesota, datedJanuary 3, 1957. The article states “Shortly before midnight (on January 2nd),while driving NE to their home, Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Naderson and their sonsobserved a ‘triangular figure with two lights side by side in the lower part andsome light along the edges in the eastern sky. A darker section was noted in thecenter. The family watched the phenomenon for three-quarters of an hour as ittraveled ‘very slowly’ and ‘high in the sky’ below high clouds.” Another report of a triangular UFO makes the news before the year ends. Thisincident was documented in the newspaper, News from Camarillo, California datedNovember 14, 1957. The incident occurred at 6:22 a.m. on November 8, 1957. Thearticle is quoted as saying: > “Mrs. Connie Foster, long time resident here, who works at Camarillo State> Hospital, went out to get her car out of her garage at 6:22 Friday morning and> saw a Flying Triangle all lighted up moving across the sky from southeast to> northwest. She said it was moving with the triangle base facing forward, and> that it looked like it was all lighted up from the inside, with bright lights> on the tips of the triangle. She watched it for nearly half an hour before it> disappeared. It was far up in the sky and not moving at a great rate of speed.> The Flying Triangle was also seen by Mrs. Larry Logue (of), 125 E. Loop,> Camarillo Heights.” This case illustrates one of the most unusual aspects of many of thesetriangular reports. Namely, the ability for them to move through the atmospherewith the “base” of the triangle as the leading-edge. This would seem tocontradict basic aerodynamic principles as we know them. If this were aconventional aircraft, why wouldn’t the point of the triangle be the leadingedge? It would seem to facilitate easier movement through the air like mostaircraft we are familiar with. We will explore this in greater detail in Chapter7. Another intriguing report can be found courtesy of another early civilian UFOinvestigative organization, The National Investigations Committee on AerialPhenomena (NICAP) that was founded in 1956. Their files, now in the possessionof The Center For UFO Studies (CUFOS) (www.cufos.org), features a report datedSeptember 5, 1958. The report details the sighting of a triangular object thatflew over the witness in Albuquerque, New Mexico on July 18, 1958. The witnesswas a high school student at the time. He was enjoying a beautiful evening lyingon his back staring at the stars. At 8:30 p.m. an object described as anequilateral triangle flew directly overhead in a north to south direction movingat an estimated 70 to 100 miles per hour. Estimated altitude was 1,000 feet. Theestimated duration of the sighting was ten seconds. This time, the point of thetriangle was the leading edge. A sketch was provided in the report and showed an equilateral trianglesurrounded on its edges by twelve small orange lights equally spaced along theedges (three on each side and one on each point). However, the witness stated hewas not sure what the total number of lights may have been. The witness alsoadded that the object, although moving in a straight line, “gave the impressionthat it was sailing – wavering from side to side a slight bit.” One comment thewitness noted on the report form was “The object I saw was very unusual.” Whocould disagree with that statement in 1958? The year 1960 had a number of well-documented reports specifically in themonth of September. The first sighting I was able to discover occurred inWestbrook, Connecticut on the evening of September 2nd and in the nearby area ofChalker Beach the subsequent evening by multiple witnesses. The sightings weredocumented in the Hartford Courant newspaper dated September 17, 1960 in anarticle entitled: “New Saucer Twist: ‘Flying Triangle’ Seen in State.” The primary witness in this report was a Mr. Richard Ireton. He and his wifeand neighbors discussed sighting “flying triangles” two weeks earlier. Heindicated that he was hesitant to initially report the sightings due to fear ofpublic ridicule. Later, he decided to come forward with his testimony. Thearticle is quoted as follows: > “Eeerie: No Noise> Ireton said that about 11:30 p.m. Sept. 2 he and his wife were driving on Rt.> 1 in Westbrook. After crossing a bridge, he noticed ‘an aircraft about to> crash.’> He stopped the car to watch the object, which he and his wife saw ‘veer to the> south toward the shore’. They drove to the beach. There they saw the object> again, going ‘about the speed of a Piper Cub plane’.> The eeriest part of the whole thing he said, was that the flying object made> no sound.> ‘Terrific Speed’> The object went toward Cornfield Point where it hovered in the air, going> first back and forth horizontally and then up and down, Ireton said. It then> flew back past him toward the public beach at Westbrook.> Ireton returned to his car and drove to the public beach. There he said, he> saw it go up and off at an angle ‘at a terrific rate of speed’ toward Long> Island Sound – but with no sound of its own.> He said the object had, at two points of the triangle, white lights, at the> third point, a blue light. In its center was a revolving red light, Ireton> said.” [images/00066.jpg]Hartford Courant, September 17, 1960. Later in the article, Ireton relates a second sighting of apparently the sameobject or similar object on September 3rd. This time, he and his wife hadadditional witnesses to the event. They were staying at his father’s cottage onChalker Beach and were in the company of the people staying in the neighboringcottage. The article stated: > “It was seen about 9:30 p.m., hovered over the water for a while, then went up> very fast and stayed in one spot.> Ireton watched the object with binoculars for half an hour. Then he became> cold, he said, and went into the cottage. Several people in this area told him> they saw the same thing at the same times, he said.> Finally feeling his experiences weren’t incredible, he reported the sightings> to State Police. They said other sightings were reported, but had no advisory> on what the object might be.” This case features many aspects that will surface time and time again as weexplore the history of reports. The characteristics of rapid speed and silentflight are of special note. This newspaper report is rare in that it featured awitness sketch of the object complete with lighting pattern. What type ofaircraft back in 1960 could explain this sighting report? Just five days later, another triangular craft was sighted over Tyneside, aregion in the northeast of England, on the evening of September 8th. Theincident was covered by the Evening Chronicle newspaper the following day. [images/00025.jpg]Evening Chronicle, September 9, 1960. A number of related news articles appeared in the subsequent days and weeksrelated to this sighting. Some articles bolstered the original witness reportswith additional eyewitness testimony while others dismissed the event as atanker aircraft refueling other planes in flight. The last report worthy of examining from that September was referenced at theend of the Hartford Courant article discussed earlier. This Associated Press(AP) article dated September 15, 1960 leaves the final interpretation up to thereader. Was it a balloon or a genuine UFO? [images/00037.jpg]AP article, September 15, 1960. The witness described it as a “dark object” which conceivably could have beena balloon. However, the object was also reportedly stationary as well as movingslowly. If the object was indeed a weather balloon that is released each morningfrom the Douglas plant, wouldn’t the witnesses be accustomed to such a sight?Why would all of these independent witnesses choose the same day to suddenlyoverreact to such a prosaic balloon? Finally, weather balloons are round inshape – not triangular. Another incident occurred south of Houston, TX. The witnesses in this casewere law enforcement officers, Deputies Billie McCoy and Bob Goode. This casewas reported in the Houston Chronicle in September 1965 (exact date unknown).The two deputies were driving back to Angleton from the city of Damon locatedtwenty-five miles to the northeast on September 3, 1965. The simplethirty-minute drive would be one these men would never forget. They described the night as clear and peaceful until their attention wasdrawn to an unusual object that was above a pasture next to the road. They werequoted as saying “It hovered in the air. It was eerie. It was shaped like atriangle 200 feet long and 40 or 50 feet high. It had a purple light on its leftside and a blue one on its right side.” The article goes on to state the objectappeared to hover just above the ground and was silent. After observing it for a time, the deputies attempted to gain access to thefenced pasture in an attempt to get a better look. However, they could notlocate an access gate. While attempting to do this, they noticed the objectbegan moving towards them. They fled to their vehicle and left the scene. Unfortunately, this night was not over for them, since the object at thispoint appeared to pursue their vehicle. Deputy McCoy was quoted as saying “Wehit 90 miles an hour and it was gaining on us. We increased our speed, but itkept gaining.” At one point, the object abruptly stopped while the car continuedto shoot down the road at high speed. The object was seen remaining stationaryfor a few seconds while the bright lights on the object illuminated thesurrounding area. The object then disappeared. This case was also profiled in the September-October 1965 issue of the APROBulletin. Additional details are mentioned in the article including the time ofthe sighting – 11:00 p.m. CST. In addition, the color of the object itself wasdescribed as “gray” with no markings. The size estimate of 200 feet in lengthwas further clarified in the article. It mentioned this was based on thedistance of the telephone poles along the road which was used as a referencepoint. The purple light was also emphasized more in this article in that itsupposedly illuminated the object itself, the pasture and highway, and theinterior and exterior of their vehicle. Also, it was noted that Deputy Goode’s car window was rolled down and hiselbow was extended out of the vehicle as it rested on the window ledge. Hestated that he definitely felt heat from the object when on its closestapproach. It was at this time that their vehicle accelerated to 110 miles perhour as their fear intensified. The final departure of the object was clarified as well. Deputy McCoy wasquoted as saying the object seemed to “snap back” to its original location whenit stopped pursuing the vehicle. Another abrupt maneuver described was when itwas last seen in that it suddenly and silently shot straight up and disappeared. This disappearance is similar in nature to yet another case from Switzerland.Again we obtain this report from the January-February 1966 issue Flying SaucerReview, which quoted the Swiss tabloid, Aftonbladet of November 6, 1965 asfollows: “Although it was bright sunlight, fisherman Mauritz Lougren, (age) 67,of Lulea says that the sky phenomenon which he and a companion saw over theLulea archipelago was quite dazzling. The object was the shape of a trianglewith very bright points, and it moved backwards and forwards in the sky for some20 minutes. It then disappeared silently, at a great speed, in a westerlydirection.” Unfortunately, the actual date of the sighting is not given. The year 1966 also had triangular UFO reports. In March, there was a rash ofUFO sightings occurring across the United States as reflected in a United PressInternational (UPI) article from the Great Bend Daily Tribune in Great Bend,Kansas dated March 25th. Titled “UFO Sightings Widespread Over Country,” thearticle discusses UFO reports from the state of Maine to the Rocky Mountainsbeing documented. One in particular involved a Mrs. Robert Gorisek of LaSalle, Illinois whoclaimed a triangular object hovered over her car for over an hour on March 25th.The object was witnessed by her and several passengers while they were drivinghome from work. As they drove through several towns, the object kept up withthem. The object was reported to have had red, orange, and white lights. Noother details were noted in the article. The interesting thing about this report is that on the same day in Victoria,British Columbia, two triangular UFOs were being observed. These were observedover the Saanich Inlet by three local residents. The Saanich Peninsula and GulfIslands Review newspaper dated March 30th stated the objects hovered 40 to 50feet above the water. Mrs. R.H. Chappell and her sister, Miss Janie Kidd, saidthe objects remained motionless for a couple minutes then moved off “slowly andgracefully.” There was no sound reported during the sighting. Both were reportedas triangular in appearance. One interesting aspect noted by Mrs. Chappell was that ruby red lights wereflashing back and forth between the UFOs as if they were signaling each other.This characteristic is interesting to note, given the testimony of “Mr. C” fromChapter 2. He described flashing lights being used apparently to communicatebetween the triangular and rectangular UFO on the morning of January 5th, 2000.Is there a pattern here? Another United Press International (UPI) article was published involving yetanother triangular UFO sighting that occurred on March 27th (two days later).This one taken from the Redlands Daily Facts in Redlands, California dated March28, 1966. [images/00048.jpg]Redlands Daily Facts, March 28, 1966. One final item worth mentioning from 1966 involves reports from the State ofNew Jersey on November 13th that year. The November 14th issue of the NewarkNews is quoted as stating “UFOs were reported(ly) seen in four sections of NewJersey yesterday. The size, actions, and color of the objects varied indescriptions by the witnesses. Three witnesses who may have seen the same thingsaid it was triangular in shape, that it hovered for a while over an area andthat it kept changing colors from red to white to green or from purple to redand white.” No other details were mentioned. Later in the article, anotherpossible triangular sighting was mentioned. Moving forward to the year 1969, we shift the focus a bit to UFO reports frombehind the Iron Curtain. In fact, I would like to cite a few cases from the bookwith that title, UFOs From Behind the Iron Curtain, by Ion Hobana and JulienWeverbergh. We must remember that information sharing between people in and outof Soviet occupied countries was difficult at-best in the 1950s and 1960s not tomention later decades before the collapse of Communist Russia. UFO informationwas no exception. But this book was one of the first to provide us with insightsinto UFO reports coming out of communist countries. The authors mention tworeports involving triangular UFOs from the year 1969. The first report involves a sighting that occurred on May 1st, 1969 nearNegru Voda, Romania. The book states “At 17:30 an illuminated triangular objectmoved soundlessly and at a fixed speed from south to north. After 20 minutes ofhanging motionless it disappeared at an angle of 90 degrees eastwards, just asfast as it had appeared. (There were) many witnesses.” The second report documents the personal sighting by one of the book’sauthors, Ion Hobana. This sighting occurred on August 30th, 1969 in Bucharest,Romania. The book states “At about 19:30 Ion Hobana was near North Station (notfar from his residence) when he saw a triangular object arise from behind thestation building. At 20 degrees above the horizon it traveled to the right anddisappeared after a few seconds behind the houses. The object was a dull orangecolor and it moved with one of its sides to the front, the opposite cornerhaving three small globules behind it. Hobana estimated its size as being abouta quarter that of the moon, but has no idea how far away it was, though he feelsit was fairly low and close in view of its large dimensions. He concludes it wasa UFO.” This report is significant due to two key factors. First, the object movedwith one of its sides to the front as opposed to one of the points of thetriangle as the leading edge. This is something we have encountered before inreviewing cases. Second, the reference to “three small globules” is important.In the book, Hobana provides a photo of the city street where he observed thisspectacle. On the photo, he drew in the triangular object and accompanying“globules” to provide the reader with a better appreciation of the sighting.When looking at the sketch, it is very reminiscent of Captain James Howard’ssketch of the large UFO and accompanying smaller objects witnessed by the BOACcrew and passengers on June 29th, 1954. One final report from 1969 is worthy of mentioning due to the proximity ofthe sighting in relation to the earlier Romanian sightings. This event was takenfrom the Atlanta Journal (no date provided). It describes the sighting of atriangular UFO over Belgrade, Yugoslavia (modern-day Serbia). The articlereferences the newspaper Politika by saying that witnesses described a roughlytriangular shape, shining dully like metal, with lights at each corner whichappeared between 5:40 p.m. and 6:10 p.m. on September 27th. It also quotes it assaying “It looked like a Zeppelin or some sort of balloon. But we don’t haveadequate equipment to establish what it was.” Again, I can appreciate the fact that this could have been a balloon.However, a triangular balloon with lights at each corner would be highlyunusual. There were atmospheric research balloons that resembled an invertedpyramid from the side. From beneath, they could have taken on the appearance ofa triangular object. In fact, I stumbled across many such reports thatultimately were determined or highly-suspected to be research balloons. One casethat generated a lot of media attention at the time occurred over the city ofMadrid, Spain in early September 1968. Another case was over the city of Riga,Latvia back on August, 6th, 1968. However, these and other misindentifiedconventional objects I have attempted to filter out of the body of cases we arenow examining. Chapter 4:The Historical Review Continues As I examined cases from the early 1970s, one newspaper report stood out. Itwas from the Breese Journal in Breese, Illinois, dated November 19, 1970. Theshort article describes the sighting by one adult and at least four teenagewitnesses on the evening of November 16th (exact time not indicated). They hadjust left a basketball game at Beckemeyer Public School when they all noticed atriangular object low in the sky to the south of their location. The object hadorange and white lights. They observed this object for ten full minutes. Whiledoing so, they also observed a second object emerge from the triangular one.This is an interesting correlate to the BOAC sighting in 1954. Lastly, thearticle states the triangular UFO moved in an erratic manner. It should be notedthat Beckemeyer, Illinois is approximately 28 miles east of Scott Air Force Basewhere the now-famous January 5th, 2000 incident occurred. Just over a year after the Beckemeyer sighting and in the same general area,a dramatic incident occurred. This is one of the more detailed historicalreports I have come across and rivals modern day accounts of these objects. Thisincident occurred in January of 1972 (exact date unknown). It was documented inthe May 31st, 1972 edition of the Metro-East Journal (now defunct). The articlediscussed local UFO sightings in the area at that time. At one point, the article states “Last January, Miss Donna Wilkins ofBartelso, a senior at Central High School in Breese, was driving in a rural areanear Bartelso with a boyfriend when they saw lights travelling in an odd patternin the distance. ‘They were moving real funny back and forth and back and forth’she said. They drove a short distance and suddenly a lighted object appeared‘right there by us’ she said. Both were frightened and they began drivingfaster. They had traveled only an estimated one-fourth mile when the objectbegan hovering over the moving auto, she said. ‘It was triangular shaped’ shesaid. ‘I could only see the bottom of it. It was real big. I guess about twicethe size of a car.’ The object’s underside appeared to be constructed of metalbeams, she said. According to Miss Wilkins, the object maintained its positionover their car although they drove up to 85 miles per hour. As they drove intoBartelso, it disappeared behind a tree line.” This is a significant report when viewed in the context of others we havereviewed thus far. First, there is the dramatic nature of their car being chasedor harassed for lack of a better term. This bears striking similarities to theevent that occurred south of Houston, Texas on September 3rd, 1965 when the twodeputies were chased by the triangular UFO up to 110 miles per hour. Second, thedescription of the object’s underside that “appeared to be constructed of metalbeams” is reminiscent of Officer David Martin’s description from January 5th,2000 where he described the underside of the object as appearing to beconstructed of individual pieces that were put together like “building blocks.”Finally, there is the proximity to Scott Air Force Base yet again. This event,along with the one from Beckemeyer and the January 5th, 2000 incident thatoccurred roughly 20 miles away, must be noted. I also find it hard to believe our military was flying such radicallyadvanced aircraft in 1972—the description of which happens to match almostexactly the report of a flying triangle from 2000. If that were the case, thenwe are still waiting to see that aircraft declassified today. If we had thistechnology in 1972, then why are we still experimenting with inferiortechnologies and lesser aircraft designs? In my humble opinion, the contentionthat these are all military aircraft is a position devoid of common sense whentaking into consideration the historical nature of these reports. In early February 1972, a very unusual case occurred over Yugoslavia. Thisreport was documented in Flying Saucer Review Case Histories February 1973issue. In the article, a reference is made to a report dated February 7th, 1972from Sarajevo. This details the sighting of a triangular UFO seen a few daysearlier (exact date unknown) between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. It goes on to statethat the UFO was picked up on radar by Sarajevo Airport and was tracked movingone kilometer per minute. However, when a Yugoslav Airlines (JAT) Convairapproached the object, it accelerated and vanished at a tremendous speed. Later that year, another triangular UFO was sighted. This time, it was overBuffalo, South Dakota. An article from the Buffalo Times Herald (date unknown)recounted the details. The UFO was sighted around 10:00 p.m. on June 29th, 1972.The object reportedly passed directly over the witnesses at a very slow speed.It was estimated to be one hundred feet long. It was described as having twobrilliant white lights at the front and two more widely-spaced, brilliantorange-white lights in the rear. It was a dark wedge-shaped object. Witnessesnoted the object moved with the blunt end at the front and the tapered end ofthe triangle at the rear. Does this sound familiar? The estimated altitude was two hundred to five hundred feet. The behavior ofthe object was further noted. It appeared to periodically move then hover andrepeat this pattern for the period of forty minutes. During this time, itemitted a muffled sound like rushing air with a faint, intermittent flutteringnoise. A final observation worth noting involved the lights on the object.Witnesses indicated the lights appeared to be “perfectly flat” and did not shineoutward to create a beam of light as would be expected. This is a detail thatwould be reported in triangular UFO reports decades later. Just five days after this event in 1972, a wave of UFO sightings began overBelgium. It would involve reports with characteristics eerily similar to thelater Belgian wave of 1989 to 1991. In addition, some of these sightinglocations were from the same general area, despite the separation of almosttwenty years between the two waves. Is this just a coincidence? The first triangular UFO report made during this wave of sightings occurredat Lamonriville (Bellevaux-Ligneuville commune). The witnesses included Belgianmissionary, Reverend Father Quertemont, along with forty-four girl guides fromDison. Sitting around a campfire at approximately 10:10 p.m. on July 4th, thenineteen-year-old guide leader, Claudine Dieupart, alerted everyone to somethingin the sky. Directly above them was a triangle of white luminous lights movingsilently overhead from the southeast to the northwest. The witnesses felt thelights were “very high” in the sky. The duration of the sighting wasapproximately five minutes. At approximately 10:30 p.m. in the city of Liege, an observer stated that heand several other witnesses at a bus stop witnessed a triangle of three verybright globes of light. These were moving slowly from east to west in a widearc. As they watched, the globes of light passed through a cloud bank andilluminated it with its lights. The clouds over Liege that evening were recordedat a maximum altitude of 2,000 meters. Around this same timeframe in the western suburbs of Liege, three youngwitnesses reported seeing a similar lighting display in the sky moving from eastto west at roughly 2000 to 3000 meters altitude. They observed this for fiveminutes. In the city of Flawinne, a timekeeper in a factory noted that at exactly10:31 p.m. he observed the flight of an equilateral triangle of three brightlights overhead. The lights appeared to ascend vertically as he observed them. At 10:40 p.m.in the city of Spy, a couple observed a similar display oflights. These lights also appeared to be flying east to west on a straightcourse and increasing slightly in altitude as they did so. An additional detailprovided by the couple involved the lights themselves. They stated the threeluminous lights appeared to be rotating and were surrounded by bluish sparks. At the railway station at Ath, a conductor observed three luminous discs inthe formation of a triangle. They were described as having hazy contours. Theconductor stated the formation moved from the east-southeast to thewest-northwest. The final witness regarding this particular night’s sightings was a youngfarmer from Ellezelles, near Renaix. At 10:45 p.m. he was in a field next to hisfarm when he noticed three bluish beams of light shining down from a luminous“cloud” that was stationary in the sky. The beams were in the shape of arcs of acircle and came down to the ground all around him at three points. Shortly afterthis, the beams withdrew into the sky. One final detail involved the actualbeams of light. The witness stated the beams fanned out wider and wider as theygot further from the source. When this reached just about one meter from theground, the beams shrank down to just very small points of light that touchedthe ground. When the beams were withdrawn, the process reversed itself. These and later reports were investigated and evaluated by the Belgiancivilian UFO organization known as SOBEPS (Société Belge d'étude des PhénomènesSpatiaux) (translated: Belgian Society for the study of Space Phenomena). It wasthis same group that investigated the later 1989-1991 Belgian wave of UFOreports. It should be noted that in both waves of sightings, their work wasexemplary. They should be commended for their efforts. The reports up to this point that SOBEPS investigated involved formations ofthree bright white lights. One could make the argument that these were attachedto a triangular object in the sky, but this would be pure supposition. In fact,in presenting the selected triangular UFO reports to you in this book, I havetried to refrain from reports of just three lights in a triangular pattern withonly few exceptions. Reports such as this may be just that – three independentlight sources moving in a triangular formation. The rationale for sharing theseBelgian reports from 1972 will become readily clear. At approximately 12:10 p.m. on July 5th, 1972, a gentlemen was parking hiscar in front of his home (location in Belgium not given) when he noticed a dozenwhitish objects flying about in the sky above him at a low altitude. He likenedthem to papers blown about in the wind. However, on this day and time, there wasno wind. This cluster was moving to the north-northwest and the man was notinterested enough to keep watching them. He did mention it to a neighbor who didcontinue watching them. The neighbor described the whitish objects as vague inshape; fleecy in appearance; and rotating slowly. Most importantly, the witnessstated they were moving in turns around a dark triangular object in the sky. Additional witnesses came forward with reports of lights in a triangularformation as late as July 19th of that year across Belgium. These too werethoroughly documented by SOBEPS investigators. Given the consistency of reportsinvolving three luminous lights in a triangular pattern along with theeyewitness testimony from July 5th of a dark triangular object and thesimilarity to other reports we have reviewed thus far, it is not outside therealm of possibility that all of these reports may have been triangular UFOs. Ifthere is still any doubt, let us not forget the later wave of reports thatfocused on these same areas in Belgium from 1989 to 1991. If there is one thingI have realized in reviewing these reports, it is that patterns do tend toemerge. In the introduction to this book, I referenced my interest in UFOs startingwith the 1973 wave of UFO sightings in and around Piedmont, Missouri. On May24th, 1973 a sighting took place in Farmington, Missouri during this timeperiod. The witness in this case is as significant as the UFO sighting itself:Dr. Harley Rutledge, author of Project Identification – The First ScientificField Study of UFO Phenomena. Dr. Rutledge served as the Chairman of the Physics Department at SoutheastMissouri State University. He also served as the President of the MissouriSection of the American Association of Physics Teachers and President of theMissouri Academy of Science. This man was not a UFO believer. He was a scientistin every sense of the word. In 1973, when the UFO sightings started to increase in southeast Missouri andgarnered lots of media attention, one of Dr. Rutledge’s colleagues asked if hewould look into the matter. Rutledge responded initially by stating he “wouldn’ttouch the subject with a ten-foot pole.” However, as a scientist, he laterdecided to gather a team of colleagues and students to conduct a series of fieldobservations to see first-hand what people were interpreting as “UFOs.” He entered into the investigation with a skeptical approach as any truescientist would. However, by the end of his investigations, he was of theopinion that there was an objective reality behind some of the UFO reports. Bothhe and other team members had their own personal UFO observations that theycould not discount. One particular sighting occurred on May 24th, 1973 that leftan indelible impression on Dr. Rutledge. To properly set the stage, Rutledge and members of his team had setup theirobservational equipment this night near the runway of Farmington MunicipalAirport. It was here the team had just finished observing an unusual amber lightin the sky at approximately 9:20 p.m. After they lost sight of the light, he andthree other team members gathered in the middle of the now-inactive runway todiscuss what they had just observed. Rutledge stated in his book “Instinctively, I tilted my head upward – andwhat I saw will be etched upon my memory for life.” He goes on to describe aconfiguration of four lights that had just flown over the heads of the team. Thecolors of the lights were (from left to right) white, red, red, white. He addedthey were in a symmetrical pattern perpendicular to the direction of motion.Further he stated “Each long and narrow light seemed to be attached or molded tothe back of a huge wing, although I couldn’t make out any form in the darkness.”He also noted the size of the formation was amazing in addition to the manner inwhich it flew low, swift, and silent. As the object continued to move away, Rutledge grabbed his binoculars andviewed the lights more closely. He had never seen these kinds of lights attachedto an aircraft before. The white lights were reflecting off of the surroundingstructure of this craft and “appeared to be a metal, like aluminum.” He thenfocused on the red lights and noted “the light was emanating from what appearedto be red glass – similar to that used in the taillights of cars.” He also noted“a raised or ribbed structure, ostensibly for reinforcing the glass.” The lighting array moved quickly out of sight and the team’s cameras wereover 150 feet away with their other field gear so no pictures were taken. Rutledge estimated the craft was approximately 2,500 feet in altitude butknew it wasn’t higher than 10,000 feet altitude due to that being the cloudceiling for that night. In his book, Rutledge estimates the size of what wasobserved. The object was between 368 feet to half a mile across in size based onits relative altitude. He added “the row of lights made a slight angle (slightlyswept wing) whose vertex was in the direction of motion.” He added, “The objectmay have been a flying wing, but one of extraordinary size and one that flewwithout a sound.” In summary, Rutledge stated the remarkable nature of this sighting “Becausethere was a low, heavy overcast, which places an upper limit on the altitude ofthe object; because there was a reasonable estimate of the angular width of thelight configuration; because there was no sound. And because there were threewitnesses for verification, this must be called an incredible sighting. No otherclassification is reasonable. In this case, the observer need not have a Ph.D.degree in physics to know that a very strange craft had passed overhead.” Iwould argue that Rutledge’s assessment could apply to many of the cases we havereviewed thus far. In Campbellsville, Kentucky, another triangular UFO report was documented bythe local newspaper, the News-Journal. In their October 25th, 1973 edition theyrecount the sightings of UFOs by several local citizens over the last week. Onecase involved Mr. Sam Richerson. At 2:00 a.m. on October 20th, he awoke due to adog’s barking having awakened his young son from a deep sleep. His wife went toattend to the boy and as she leaned over to pick up the child, she noticed aglowing object across the road. She then drew her husband’s attention to it.They both stood and watched the object for about fifteen minutes. Mr. Richersondescribed it as a “triangular-shaped object about the size of two cars hoveringabout tree-top high not more than one hundred yards from his home.” Incredibly, this brings us to another report from Southern Illinois thatoccurred on the same date. This report is taken from the Alton Telegraph inAlton, Illinois dated October 22, 1973. The title of the article is “Latest UFOover Milton (Road).” It states that an Alton resident made a report to policeafter he claimed to have witnessed a “triangular-shaped form with bright whitelights hovering over Milton Road.” The sighting occurred on October 20th shortlybefore 8:00 p.m. The witness also described seeing a second triangle of lightsabove the first. The witness told police these were not conventional aircraft.This is but one example of earlier reports describing two or more triangularUFOs being seen in conjunction with one another. Despite being on the same day, the Kentucky report was at 2:00 a.m. thatmorning and the Illinois report was later that night at 8:00 p.m. Regardless ofthe time difference, it is interesting that these occurred on the same date.Whether the two instances are related I cannot say. An interesting article surfaced from the Cross Country News in Fort Worth,Texas. In the January 8th, 1975 edition is a story concerning a “rash ofreports” regarding UFOs that swept through the United States and Canada inNovember of 1974. The article is quoted as saying “Hundreds of sightings came topolice as the object reportedly cruised, often at tree-top level, over the U.S.and Canada. Sightings were reported two days in Florida, Georgia, Ohio, andMichigan. All described the object as flashing red, green, and white lights.Several described it as having a triangular shape.” The article then recounts the November 11th sighting in Madison, Ohio byPatrolmen Zachary Space and Lester Nagle. They supposedly chased the UFO for atotal of twenty minutes. They were also joined by a Madison resident and asheriff’s deputy. Patrolman Space stated they all watched the object hoveringlevel with high-tension wires near the Ashtabula County line. He is quoted assaying “It came down above the wires for maybe 15 or 20 seconds, and then wouldrise up slowly out of sight, then appear again. It did not resemble a plane orhelicopter. As far as speed, it left like a flash.” He went on to add “When theUFO rose it had three dominant white lights with a glow around it.” In a finalhumorous remark, the patrolman added “my name would have to be ‘Space’ to top itall off. But there were other witnesses who saw the same thing.” This brings us to the first well-documented wave of triangular UFO reports inthe United States. Prior to this timeframe, there were only isolated reports oftriangular UFO sightings there. This wave of sightings covered the period ofApril 3rd to April 9th, 1975. The sightings were confined to a relatively smallgeographic area (40 mile radius) in the southeastern portion of the state ofNorth Carolina. The principal investigators of this activity were veteran UFOresearchers, Jennie Zeidman, Lee Spiegel, and Ted Phillips. The most comprehensive analysis of this particular UFO wave was written byZeidman entitled, The Lumberton Report: UFO Activity in Southern North CarolinaApril 3-9, 1975. This was published by the Center For UFO Studies (CUFOS)(www.cufos.org) in 1976. We will cite details from this comprehensive reporthere. The report begins by describing the UFOs the bulk of which involved “aV-shaped or wedge-shaped object, brightly lighted, apparently the size of anautomobile, which was seen by many observers, at close range, over a severalnight span.” Zeidman’s report continues: > “The characteristics of the V-shaped object (each reported by at least two> witnesses) which determine its being classified as a UFO are:> 1. Range of speed from hovering to 200+ miles per hour in very short periods> of time.> 2. Ability to execute flat (as opposed to banked) turns.> 3. An intensely bright spotlight which had directional maneuverability,> variable intensity, and, on at least two occasions, appeared to ‘signal’ in> response to automobile headlight or automobile spotlight blinking.> 4. Absence of noise: only three witnesses (out of more than fifty) reported> any sound from the object in spite of the fact that most observers felt that> they were within 200 feet of it.” Of course, these characteristics are all too familiar in the context of thereports we have and will continue to examine. In Chapter 7 we will explore thesein greater detail. Zeidman goes on to state, “Although the objects described and drawn could bemore accurately described as triangular or delta-shaped, the term ‘Vee’ is usedin this report whenever that specific word was used by the reporter.” We cannotexamine the full investigative report in this work. However, let us look at justa few examples of what was being reported in North Carolina in the Spring of1975. The first sighting of a triangular-shaped object during this wave occurred inthe early hours of April 3rd. Two Lumberton police officers had observed a lighthovering over a water tower located behind the Lumberton High School. At thesame time, another officer, Phil Stanton, was alone in his police carapproximately 200 yards from this same water tower observing the same light. He,like the other officers, thought at first this was just a helicopter. Stanton isquoted as saying “I saw it hovering directly over the tower. When I got closer,(I) switched off my motor and got out of the car, that’s when I saw it close up.It was triangular-shaped with a row of lights down each side, and one bigspotlight on the front. I estimated the object to be about 200 feet off theground because the water tower is nearly 200 feet high. The craft looked like itwas just about the size of my patrol car. I saw a beam of light just directedstraight down and it lit up the lettering on the water tower. Then the spotlightwent out and the thing just took off at a terrific rate of speed, making nosound.” The report included a sketch made by Officer Stanton. [images/00038.jpg]Officer Stanton’s Sketch The mysterious object headed in the direction of St. Pauls, North Carolina(12 miles due north). In St. Pauls, Officer R.T. Hagens and civilian JohnMcPherson heard Officer Stanton notify them over the police radio of an unusualobject heading in their direction. Two miles outside of town, they bothwitnessed a “blinding flash of light which lit up the woods like a giant flashbulb” according to McPherson. He continued “When I first saw the object it wascoming up from behind some trees, which led me to believe it had been on theground before that. I could see the outline of the trees silhouetted against thelight.” It should be mentioned here that an almost identical scenario played out withtwo Belgian gendarmes during the Belgium UFO wave. They described a triangularUFO rise up from behind trees as if taking off from the ground with lightsshining through the trees. This incident occurred near Lake Gileppe at 6:45 p.m.on November 29th, 1989. This was one of the first reports that began the UFOwave that would last into 1991. Back to Lumberton, Officer McPherson’s partner Hagens added, “It rose slowlyabove the trees; started to move slowly; then suddenly accelerated; changeddirection; and in 15 to 20 seconds it had faded out and disappeared. The lighthad intensified real bright when it first started to accelerate.” Both witnessesstated there was no sound. Hagens made a sketch of what they witnessed. McPherson and Hagens were not the only law enforcement officers to witnessthe craft; other officers in the surrounding area also saw similar lights andshapes in the night sky. [images/00039.jpg]Officer R.T. Hagens’ sketch. Almost twenty-four hours after the first UFO sighting over the water tower,another wave of sightings occurred the following early morning of April 4th. At1:00 a.m., reports began to pour into local police and sheriffs’ departments.Officer John Hayes of the Newton Grove Police department was informed of thisinflux of reports by the Sampson County Sheriff’s Department. Based on thereports, the object that was being sighted was heading in his direction. At one point, Hayes pulled his police cruiser over to the side of the roadand turned the engine and lights off. He did this in response to seeing anobject in the sky approaching him. The object flew directly over his head. Hestated “I got outside the car then and estimated the object to be 300 to 400feet high. The only sound I was able to hear was a very slight humming noise. Inoticed a grayish-blue glow around the outer edges of the thing, and also notedthat the craft was moving extremely slow…much too slow for any conventionalaircraft.” Officer Hayes observed this for two minutes and indicated he could make out asolid structured object with a series of lights on each side. He also notedthere was a large spotlight in the front. Most importantly, he stated the objectmade a flat turn as opposed banking like a conventional aircraft. He alsoprovided a sketch to investigators. Just like the morning before, this sighting was followed by additional UFOreports of similar description that followed in a sequential order. These werejust the first two days of UFO activity over this relatively small geographicarea. Again, the activity persisted up until April 9th, but then abruptly ended.No rational explanation was ever found for the basis of these reports. However,the details reported by the witnesses in and around Lumberton in 1975 seem tomatch reports elsewhere in the world. Again, credit must be given to theoutstanding investigators in this case for their in-depth reporting andanalysis. [images/00049.jpg]Officer John Hayes’ sketch. The locations and times of the Lumberton area sightings were consistent witha solitary unidentified flying object moving from town to town as witnessed mymultiple eyewitnesses most of whom were police officers. Yet another area, twoyears later, would have virtually the same drama play itself out involvingpolice officers as witnesses. On the night/morning of May 16th/17th 1977 in Memphis, Tennessee, the nextsignificant incident involving this type of UFO would take place. The MemphisPress-Scimitar article dated May 17th was extremely detailed and paints a clearpicture of what reportedly transpired. The article opens with the dramatic statement “A monster ‘UFO’ (UnidentifiedFlying Object) described as big as a football field, visited Memphis and ShelbyCounty last night, four policemen and a Tennessee highway patrolman said today.”It continues “Officers T.L. Todd and J.W. Jeter of the Police Tactical Squadsaid they saw the huge object, pyramidal in shape with red and green blinkinglights on its corners while they were on I-240 near Norris about 3:45 a.m.” [images/00001.jpg]Memphis Press-Scimitar sketch. > “The officers said they spotted the huge vehicle, estimated at 300 feet long,> three separate times.> ‘We called the police dispatcher to report what we had seen and we were still> on the air talking to him when a Tennessee State Highway patrolman called in> from Collierville to report he had seen it,’ Jeter said.> The two officers said a team of officers from the North Precinct then broke> into the conversation to ask if it was triangular in shape.> Todd said the men were M.

It was in the shape of a perfect triangle, standing on> its edge. It was so close it almost looked as if I could reach out and touch> it,’ he said. ‘There was a sort of a white glow around it.’” Later, the officers observed the object “flying flat” (i.e., horizontalposition parallel to the ground) as opposed to standing on edge. At this point,the officers grabbed their rifle that had a magnified spotting scope which theyused as a telescope to view the object more closely. The UFO may not have beenoverly enthused by a rifle being trained on it since Jeter is quoted as saying“I just got a glimpse of it in the scope when it took off and was gone, justlike that.” An interesting observational note was made by the officers. They indicatedthat, if the object reported in Collierville was the same object, it traveledroughly 30 miles in just seconds. In addition, the object was completely silent.Both Todd and Jeter insisted there was no noise coming from the object. Jeterstated “If it had been a jet plane, we certainly would have heard the noise.” If this case does not resemble the events of January 5th, 2000, then whatdoes? Here we have law enforcement officers spread out over a fairly localizedarea in radio contact with one another as they are observing what can only bedefined as an unconventional object of triangular shape. The characteristics of the object certainly are comparable to the objectwitnessed over twenty years later in Southern Illinois. The large triangularshape (estimated 300 feet long), coupled with the ability to hover low, moveslowly, rapidly accelerate—and do all of this silently—is not coincidental. Thetestimony of these men simply cannot be ignored when their testimony couldequally be used in a court of law to convict someone of a crime. Either thesemen are credible witnesses or they are not. While under observation by the police officers, these objects continued toharass drivers and passengers. The Belleville Intelligencer from Ontario, Canadadated May 6th, 1977 had the article entitled: “UFO Hovered Over Car.” Thearticle relates details from a March 19th UFO sighting that year by a Lindsay,Ontario woman and her 12-year old daughter. The mother, Sylvia Laidler, statedshe and her daughter, Darlene, were driving eastbound on Highway 401 around 8:00p.m. when a “red streak” appeared out of the north. She said the UFO stopped abruptly over the highway in front of her car. Whileit hovered, it maintained “a red pulsating glow.” She continued by adding “Thenwe saw it was coming directly towards us flying on the south side of the highwayat tree top level.” She described the object as having “turquoise lights and redflashing lights.” She added “It was a triangular shape with a goldish lightflashing at the bottom of the craft as it flew over our car but hovered directlyover us.” While they were observing all of this, both witnesses did not noticeany noise coming from the object. The object reportedly then moved in asoutherly direction and disappeared when another car’s headlights appeared andapproached them. The article states the only reason the witness came forwardabout their sighting was due to others having written to the newspaper to reportother sightings in the area. It is nice to see that, after so many years, these triangular objects stillhave an affinity for pursuing motor vehicles. Remember, we have other cases sofar where that behavior has been exhibited: outside Houston, Texas in 1965;LaSalle, Illinois in 1966; and Bartelso, Illinois in 1972 to name a few. Again,there seems to be consistency in the reports and consistency in thecharacteristics and behaviors of these objects. Four days after this newspaper article was published in Canada, anothersighting occurred in the United States in Rome, Georgia. The local newspaper,Rome News-Tribune, quickly published the report the day of the sighting on May10th, 1977. The primary witness, a 19-year old student pilot by the name ofPhylis Barlow, claimed to have witnessed a triangular UFO in the sky around 5:10a.m. She stated in the article “It seemed to be circling slowly over the area.It was flying at a tilt, and on the bottom of the object was a circle of foggylight surrounding a triangle of intense bright light.” As the object made asecond pass over the area, she called out to a friend in the immediate area whoalso witnessed the object. Together, they watched it for approximately tenminutes. Barlow stated “It was pretty high up at first, but then it started gettinglower and lower. As it came closer, the light seemed to fade. I guess it stoppedabout 1000 feet above the ground and we could see about forty per cent of thebottom of the object. The body was a flat grayish-silver color and three creamyyellow lights were distinguishable along the bottom at that distance. They wereoval-shaped and honeycombed. The UFO stopped and hovered for a minute and dartedoff toward Atlanta at a tremendous rate of speed.” Barlow also stated “When I first saw it, I thought it was some kind ofaircraft, but planes can’t hover, and this object did not have the blinking,rotating lights airplanes and helicopters are required to have. The lights onthis vehicle were constant, and some were dulled.” The article points to the fact that the object made no noise. Barlow said “Asclose as it got at times, I’m sure we would have been able to hear engine noise,if there was any. And besides, the range of speed on this thing was too varied.Sometimes it would hover, then (it would) fly slowly, and sometimes it woulddart around at an amazing speed.” Moving from the United States to France, we find another report from thenewspaper, Le Republicain Lorrain, dated December 8th, 1977. The article startsoff by referencing an article in their previous issue involving a UFO sightingin Behren les Forbach (a city near the French/German border in the Lorraineregion). No details or exact date are given, but the article continues bystating that another UFO eyewitness has come forward. This witness is from thecity of Falck (in the Lorraine region). This new witness is reported to haveobserved a triangular UFO while driving to the city of Brettnach (also in theLorraine region) around 5:15 p.m. The witness is quoted as saying “I have seentwo luminous headlights in the sky. The object was motionless.” He continued bysaying “I saw a third headlight and the object appeared like a triangle with ared light in the middle. I didn’t hear any noise. Abruptly, the UFOdisappeared...” It is worth noting that this sighting occurred in the year 1977. It would beanother 12 years before the famous Belgian UFO wave would develop. Yet, we havea UFO report that bares remarkable similarities to the later Belgian reports (atriangular object with lights at each point; and a red light in the center; thatmoves silently; and has the ability to abruptly depart). The year 1978 had some extremely interesting cases in the United States. InJanuary, reports began to filter into authorities in the State of New Jersey onthe East Coast. This was followed in February by reports in California on theWest Coast. We will examine each in-turn. The New Jersey sightings were focused on the city of Vineland locatedapproximately 36 miles inland to the west-northwest of Atlantic City. TheAtlantic City Press published an article entitled “Vineland Is Beset by UFOSightings” in their February 3rd issue. The article relates that at least threeseparate sightings have been reported in the last week. The first, in order of occurrence, took place on January 27th, 1978 (no timegiven). The witness, Cheryl DeSanctis, initially observed a blinking red andwhite light in the sky hovering above some trees. She watched it stay in astationary position for five minutes then a “red ball” moved from behind it.This “ball” then descended to just a few feet above the rooftops where the lightcould be seen reflecting off of the houses as it moved. The “red ball” thenmoved to the north and the main object departed in the opposite direction to thesouth. She watched this portion for a total of ten minutes. No description of atriangular object was noted. Four nights after this sighting, another one occurred in the same area. OnJanuary 31st, 1978, Pat Martinelli was outside her home at approximately 11:00p.m. when she saw an object above the nearby trees. She is quoted as saying “Itwas not as low flying as a small airplane, but it was lower than most airplanes.It was a triangle with the point at the back and a lot of red and white lights,more than planes usually have.” She then stated, “Besides, you can usually tellthe humming sound of a plane.” She added that this object she witnessed did nothave any sound. The following night, the third local sighting occurred. This involved sixlocal teenagers who were driving in town when their attention was drawn to aseries of four large lights low in the sky heading towards their vehicle. One ofthe witnesses, Donald Bennett, was quoted in the article as saying “It didn’tstop, but kind of swerved at a tight angle. When it was sideways, we all saw it.It looked like a triangle shape with a light in each corner, and it went backthe way it came.” The youths then decided to follow the object in their vehicle.They followed it for approximately six or seven miles, but pulled over at onepoint and decide to end the pursuit. An interesting final note worth mentioning involves their car’s headlights.When they stopped their pursuit, they turned off the car and headlights. Whentheir headlights went out, the UFO’s lights went out. They then turned back onthe headlights of their car at which point the UFO’s lights turned on as well.At this point, the UFO was high in the sky. At its closest approach, theyestimated the UFO was about a mile distant and 500 to 600 feet altitude. Thismutual interplay of lights turning off and on may be another suggestion ofintelligence behind these objects. We find one of the most credible triangular UFO reports from 1978 asdocumented in the March 1st issue of the Auburn, California Auburn Journal. Thearticle entitled “More Reports Confirm Strange Craft in Placer Area” documentsseveral eyewitness reports of an unusual craft moving in the skies. The primarywitness the article focused on was Mr. Brian Metcalfe. Metcalfe was of specialimportance not only for his detailed sighting report, but also for hisbackground. Metcalfe, at that time, was a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)air traffic controller. The article relates that Metcalfe was driving on Interstate 80 betweenRoseville and Newcastle, California at approximately 9:40 p.m. on February 22nd,1978. As he approached Newcastle, he noticed two intense lights in the sky. Hewas surprised at how slow the object seemed to be moving so he pulled hisvehicle over to get a better look. He turned the motor off and exited thevehicle. The only sound he noted was a “low hum.” The UFO moved southwest alongthe freeway at 30 to 40 miles per hour and at an estimated altitude of 2,000 to3,000 feet according to Metcalfe. As it approached, he noticed it was “deltashaped” and had no “defined control surfaces and no apparent markings.” The UFOthen moved in an easterly direction. Others in the area also testified to seeingthe object which bolstered Metcalfe’s description. One such witness mentioned in the article was Mary Cuneo and her twelve yearold son, Mike. They saw the UFO over the city of Auburn located just to thenortheast of Newcastle just before 10:00 p.m. They too initially saw the twobright lights. Then, as the object got closer, they noticed a triangular objectthat moved silently at an estimated 30 to 40 miles per hour and at an estimatedaltitude of 400 to 500 feet. One final detail provided by Mrs. Cuneo was that“As it passed, you could see the back end with lights on it. The smaller lightswere blue or green.” This brings us to Patapsco State Park in the State of Maryland. This wasanother interesting case documented quite well by The Aerial Phenomena ResearchOrganization (APRO) in their April 1978 issue of the APRO Bulletin. The articlestates “On Wednesday, March 22, 1978 at approximately 11:00 p.m. EST, GaryOickle, 24, his brother David, 22, and two friends, Barry Smith, 22 and KenCabot, 25 were around a campfire talking in Patapsco State Park at the Baltimore& Ohio railroad tunnel. Barry and David were about 50 feet away from the otherswhen they noticed a strange object in the southeastern sky which disappearedover a ridge in the distance. They watched the object for about 10 seconds andcould see no particular details except a rough shape. Barry described it as aflat looking object. They then walked back to the fire to tell the other two about what they hadseen when another similar object appeared directly over the four of them frombehind a ridge to their north. The object was described as a huge triangularshaped object with large windows and three white lights at the corners. The sizewas estimated from ‘a quarter the size of a football field’ to ‘150-200 feet oneach side’. The object moved very slowly, hovering at times, in a southeasterndirection following the contour of the ridges just above the trees. When it appeared above them it was very low, approximately 200-250 feet, andmade a sound like a ‘quiet wind’ or ‘quietly rushing waterfall’. The witnesseswatched the object for approximately 15 to 20 seconds until it disappearedbehind the trees. Three of the witnesses thought they could see the shadow orsilhouette of a figure at the windows. Three of the witnesses also reportedseeing a bright star-like object in the southern sky immediately after thesighting. Two of them said the star-like object changed colors; blue, green,yellow, red, repeatedly, while the other thought the object may have been ahelicopter or something in the distance. Two of the witnesses thought that the large triangular object had a‘metallic’ or ‘bluish-gray’ color, but all four agreed that it had three whitelights at the corners and a blinking red light on the top.” The APRO Bulletin article also contained a sketch provided by the witnesses. [images/00009.jpg] Another typical report is taken from the Daily News in New York. In theirJune 24th, 1978 edition, an article recounts the unusual encounter of twoMaplewood police officers, Robert Fiorentino and Anthony Puglio. Both men had atriangular UFO sighting on June 17th at 4:30 a.m. While they were on patrol, theobject came into view. They pulled their vehicle over and exited the vehicle toget a better look at the object. They described it as a soundless, triangular flying object. It was estimatedto be twice the size of a full moon. In addition, it had a white light on eachtip of the triangle and red lights in the center. As both men stood watching,the object circled them twice and shone bright lights down on them. OfficerFiorentino was quoted as saying “It was blinding.” In Canada, we find yet another report of triangular UFOs interested in motorvehicles. A small article from the Evening Tribune in Welland, Ontario dated May1st, 1978 describes the sighting by a Mrs. Debra Gairns. She, along with herhusband and friend, were driving along on the evening of April 26th atapproximately 11:00 p.m. in Welland (located approximately 25 miles to thenorthwest of Buffalo, New York). She stated the object hovered directly overtheir car for a few moments then moved away and hovered over a nearby group oftrees. Gairns stated the object was triangular in shape with red, white, andblue blinking lights. Finally, she noted it was completely silent. It eventuallydisappeared over the city. One of the most dramatic reports I have come across is out of England from1978. The Stoke-on-Trent Evening Sentinel published an article on September 16thentitled “U.F.O. shot a beam of light at our car – claim” that detailed achilling encounter with a large triangular UFO. A young couple, StephenColclough and his girlfriend, Patricia, were driving through the village ofDilhorne in Staffordshire around 1:30 a.m. that same day. They were followingtwo friends who were in a vehicle in front of them. Suddenly, Colclough noticeda red and white light move across the sky. The newspaper quotes him as stating“Then, seemingly out of nowhere, this enormous black object loomed up in frontof both cars and shot a beam of light at us. It was as bright as a powerfulsearchlight and remained on both cars for about three seconds. We stoppedimmediately. It was absolutely terrifying. I am shivering now just thinkingabout it. It was the most frightening thing I have ever seen.” He also addedthat the object was completely silent. On October 30th, the Leicester Mercury out of Leicester, England published asmall article entitled “200 report seeing UFO.” It goes on to state that “Morethan 200 people have reported seeing a delta shaped unidentified flying objectspotted in Leicestershire last Monday” (October 23rd). It later states “Theobject was delta shaped with a mass of lights and it was sighted between 6:30and 8:30 p.m.” No further details are provided. The day this newspaper article was published, another triangular UFO sightingwas taking place back in the United States. On October 30th at 6:30 p.m., ateenager and friend reportedly observed a UFO over a field in Denison, Texas (63miles north of Dallas, Texas). The teenager told police the UFO wasapproximately the size of a house and was 100 feet above them. He described theUFO as triangular in shape. Most puzzling was the claim that the UFO shot a“blue light” at both witnesses which temporarily blinded them. Police checkedthe area, but found nothing according to the Denison Herald, dated October 31st,1978. This case might easily be discounted, if it wasn’t for the similarinstance in Dilhorne, England just a little over a month before. One of the last reports for 1978 was from Demopolis, Alabama. The DemopolisTimes, dated January 4th, 1979 carried a large news article on local UFOsightings simply titled “Locals sight U.F.O.” The first witness it references isBobby Hines who was awakened at 4:00 a.m. on December 31st to the sound of herdogs outside barking. She recalls seeing a “very large and bright objecthovering over the trees about 600 yards from the house. The dogs and the cowswere really making a lot of noise. Whatever it was really had them upset becausethey never make that much noise.” She then woke her husband who also watched theobject for a time. The object was described as about the size of a small houseand triangular in shape. After hovering for several minutes, it moved towards their home. Hines stated“As it came towards the house, it moved in a zigzag pattern. Not very fast orfar, but it was definitely moving…” She also added “It hovered for over a halfhour.” Police were called during this time and, as they approached the home, thetwo responding officers, Wayne Mitchell and Mike Slocum, both testified toseeing the object hovering and taking off to the southeast. The article adds“Their police report, filed at 4:29 a.m. Sunday, described a large, brightobject hovering some 50 feet off the ground and then moving to the southeastmaking a funny noise.” A number of other individuals in the community observed the object at thesame time according to the article. One witness, Mr. Fred Mayton, lived near theHines family. He claimed the object was triangular-shaped with a blue-whiteglow. He also added “The whole thing was lit up on the bottom…It looked solidbut I couldn’t tell what kind of material.” The most notable account of a triangular UFO sighting in 1979 consisted ofmultiple witnesses stretched across northwestern Kansas and southwesternNebraska. The event occurred on the evening of August 2nd at approximately 11:30p.m. The UFO reportedly moved from the south to the north from Kansas across theborder into Nebraska. The McCook Gazette newspaper in Nebraska published aseries of stories covering this event. Their first story, dated August 7th, was titled “Strange Object Seen ByKansas Residents” and interviewed the Tongish family from the Herndon, Kansasarea. The mother and her daughter were riding bicycles late into the eveningwhen they noticed a strange light to the south. The light just seemed to hover.The daughter, Dawn, retrieved a set of binoculars from their home and they bothcontinued to observe the light. Eventually, the rest of the family joined themoutside to watch. This consisted of Mr. Tongish, son, and other daughter. They noticed the object made no noise when it hovered, but it did when itbegan to move. However, they indicated the sound made by the object wasunfamiliar. Dawn drew a sketch of the object and stated the object had threesides. She also indicated there were red lights at each tip of the triangle andone in the middle. There were additional red and white lights as well. Theobject itself had a dull metal appearance and was estimated to be fifty feetlong. [images/00071.jpg]Witness sketch of object seen August 2, 1979. The article continues by interviewing an additional witness from Herndon whocorroborated the Tongish’s statements. In addition, Mrs. Arlo Wurm from aneighboring area south of Herndon was driving home with her teenage son anddaughter when they observed the same object. She was quoted as saying it wasvery low to the ground “lower than the helicopters we see around here.” Inaddition, she noted the object was moving very slowly. She observed it hoveringover their farm’s feedlot. While observing it there, she noted it had a cone inthe front and then a black object behind the cone “about the size of a footballfield.” Behind the black portion, more lights were noted. According to Wurm, theobject moved to the north-northwest. She did note a sound similar to a blimpmotor when it first started moving. Later, she said it resembled more of a jetmotor. A final comment made by Wurm was that she had heard of another witnesswho observed a light supposedly detach from this triangular object and thenreturn to it. The next newspaper article by the McCook Gazette was dated August 9th titled“A Bird? A plane? No, It’s…(?)” this article focused on the testimony providedby the Rippen family who lived outside of Culbertson, Nebraska (locatedapproximately 30 miles north of Herndon, Kansas). Their testimony backed theeyewitness statements of the Kansas residents who observed this object. Namely,that the object was triangular; had the ability to hover silently; made a slightengine sound when it moved; and was very low to the ground. The subsequent newspaper article was dated the following day, August 10thtitled “Flying Object Seen North of Culbertson.” So here we continue to trackthe object’s flight path as additional information is provided. This articleinterviewed 18-year old Todd Wagner who, as the article indicates, “lives aboutone-half mile north and one-fourth mile west of Culbertson.” Wagner’s testimonycontinued to paint the same picture regarding the mysterious object of August2nd. He stated the object was triangular; hovered periodically at an estimated200 to 300 feet altitude; and made a humming sound. He added that there appearedto be a fourth red light on top of the object. Finally, he indicated thereappeared to be a glow in the front of the vehicle compared to the light shiningthrough a window. It is interesting to note this article postulates a number of explanationsfor the sightings. One is that perhaps this is a “new jet helicopter from somebranch of the armed forces.” Again, this is a logical assumption for the time.However, as we continue to review the long history of these reports worldwide,the military explanation is simply untenable in my opinion. The last newspaper article that documented this event is dated August 11thand is titled “SAC Lacks Facts, Too – What Was Up August 2nd?” The articlebegins by stating that at least 21 witnesses have come forward claiming to havewitnessed the UFO in-question. It also mentions that the Associated Press (AP)made inquiries with the Strategic Air Command (SAC) in Omaha, Nebraska. A SACspokesman stated they had no aircraft resembling the triangular shape which hasbeen described. He added that, to his knowledge, they had no aircraft at alloperating in that area on that night. He did add that he had not reviewed allrecords yet, though. The article also provided additional eyewitness testimony. One of theobservers was an Atwood, Kansas police officer, Lindsey Cooper. He saw thelights at an estimated distance of 15 to 20 miles, but could not make out ashape due to this distance. One other witness was Mr. Jim Armagost of McCook,Nebraska. He observed the object with his wife and one of his children. He couldnot discern the shape of the object against the brilliance of the lights. Heindicated the lights in front were like landing lights and he also noticed a redlight on the top and on the bottom. It never hovered when he observed it.However, it moved “not very fast” and was silent. Chapter 5:The Historical Review Concludes This brings us to the decade of the 1980s. Some significant cases emergedduring this period as well. The first significant report occurred over Red Wing,Minnesota as reported in their Republican Eagle edition dated January 15th,1980. The article’s title “5 watch tree-hovering UFO for 6 minutes, ‘won’t sayit’s from space’ “ leads into describing the sighting of a Brenda Simanski andfive other witnesses. Simanski had just finished her work shift at a nursing home at 9:00 p.m. onJanuary 13th and exited the building with a friend, Janine Mattson. They werestanding outside in the parking lot waiting for Brenda’s mother to pick her upwhen they noticed a “star going berserk” according to Simanski. The articlestates she drew a zigzag line on a piece of paper to illustrate this maneuver.The light then moved towards the pair of young women and “in no more than twominutes” was overhead according to Simanski. The object was described initiallyas a triangle of lights. Reportedly there were two white lights in front; bluein the back two corners; and a solitary red light between the blue ones. Theycontinued to describe the object as quite flat. The dimensions were estimated tobe fifteen feet wide and twenty feet long. Astonished by the sudden approach and appearance of this object, the twowomen dove into Mattson’s car that was next to them. Simanski stated “It wasdirectly above us when the two lights went on.” She saw two “egg-shaped lights”on either side of the leading white light. She added that “they weren’tspotlights,” but were very bright. At this point it appeared to be hovering overthem and a large fifty-foot high oak tree that was on that side of the parkinglot. They rolled a window down to see if they heard any noise coming from theobject, but there was a complete absence of sound. Another employee left the building at 9:03 p.m. and heard the two girlsscreaming out of fear. Simanski yelled “UFO” to the worker and she looked up tosee the triangular object hovering over them. The additional witness stated “Isaw what looked like a jet right over the parking lot. I thought it was a jetgoing to crash on us.” She added “It was barely moving, slower than you couldwalk. I was so in shock I couldn’t think.” Mattson and Simanski dashed into the building to get other witnesses to thisevent. Additional employees came outside and saw the object as well. One witnesswas quoted as saying “It was right there, right there in the corner of the lot.”As the group watched in amazement, the object eventually started to move in anorth-northwest direction at a very slow pace. This direction took it overHighway 61 where the object was last seen before it “just disintegrated”according to one witness. Another witness stated “In the blink of an eye it wasgone.” After the object disappeared, the group of witnesses immediately contactedthe local police who arrived on the scene within minutes. One witness said that,out of three police officers, only one believed their story. Frustrated theyadded “What’s the use of telling anyone if they don’t believe us?” Eyewitnesssketches were provided. [images/00051.jpg]Three witness sketches of object seen on January 13, 1980. It wasn’t until later that year when triangular UFO reports appeared toincrease in frequency. The next news article of interest was taken from theDaily Olympian edition of October 9th from Olympia, Washington. It covered threerecent UFO reports from Thurston County that had been reported to Bob Gribble ofPhenomena Research (a UFO investigative organization) based in Seattle. This isthe same Bob Gribble who was the founder of the now-famous National UFOReporting Center based in Washington State. The first report involved the sighting of a UFO four miles northwest of Yelm,Washington (approximately 60 miles south of Seattle) on October 7th at 11:30p.m. Witnesses reported a “huge object shaped like a triangle in front with redand green lights.” The object reportedly passed over the vehicle they were in atthe time. The second sighting occurred the same night (no time provided) in the areaaround Tenino, Washington (approximately 14 miles to the southwest of Yelm). Theobject seen there was reported as being triangular in front and dark with awhite glow. This object was flying low and fast. No additional details wereprovided on this sighting. The third and final report discussed in the article occurred near OffuttLake, Washington (just 5 miles to the northeast of Tenino) on the same evening(no time provided). This report involved the sighting of a UFO by passengers ina car like the first report. The UFO was described as diamond shaped and gold incolor. You may be curious why I included this report considering the object reportedwas diamond shaped – not triangular. First, the sightings all occurred within a20 mile radius of one another on the same evening. It is doubtful this is acoincidence. Second, there are a number of reports involving triangular anddiamond shaped UFOs sighted together as well as other UFOs of varying shape seenin conjunction with triangular UFOs (e.g., January 5th, 2000). We will explorethis characteristic more in Chapter 7. An event that generated an avalanche of news reports occurred on the eveningof November 18th, 1980. On this night, one or multiple triangular UFOs werereported over parts of northern Missouri and northeastern Kansas. Like many UFOincidents of this nature, the initial news stories reflect the preliminaryreports from a given area. The first report I found was from the Kirksville,Missouri Express & News edition of November 19th. The article recounts thesightings in that general area the night before. At the time, they were unawareof the scope of the sightings. Later, they would realize there were eyewitnessesspread out over a much larger area. The article of November 19th starts by saying “Hundreds of residents of northMissouri from 50 miles west of Trenton to Kirksville reported sighting anunidentified object flying across the sky Tuesday night.” It continues bymentioning the Kirksville police station had started receiving reports around9:00 p.m. that evening. All reports suggested the mystery object traveled fromwest to east at a relatively low altitude and slow speed. The majority of callsdescribed lights resembling headlights on a car that appeared to be attached toan object. No reports in this article mentioned triangular or any other shape.Later reports, as we will see, will fill in the details. This initial news story also made a few references worth noting. First, itstated that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in Columbia, Missouri saidthat no military aircraft of any type was scheduled to fly in that area on thatnight. They added that they receive weekly notices from the military regardingany flight patterns and schedules. They did confirm that several pilots of smallplanes had reported similar sightings that evening. Second, the police contacted the local Air Force radar base located sevenmiles north of Kirksville shortly after 9:00 p.m. The radar personnel initiallystated the object seen was an airplane. However, at 10:40 p.m., the policereceived a phone call from that same base stating the object was not anairplane. In a rare instance, we have reference to radar data associated withthese UFOs. The article is quoted as saying “The radar that was tracking theobject recorded maneuvers that cannot be made by an airplane, and the lightconfiguration was not like that of any plane, according to radar basepersonnel.” Approximately 60 miles to the west of Kirksville, a radio disc jockey inTrenton, Missouri started receiving calls from citizens claiming to see a UFOaround 8:30 p.m. The object reportedly was 15 miles west of Trenton. At 9:00p.m. he stepped outside to see if he could see anything. He too spotted a pairof bright headlights in the sky. He observed these for several minutes moving ata steady speed to the east. He then contacted the Strategic Air Command (SAC)bases in Omaha, Nebraska and Belleville, Illinois (Scott Air Force Base). He wastold by both that no aircraft were scheduled to fly in that area at that time. Additional details were provided by the Constitution-Tribune of Chillicothe,Missouri (located south of Trenton) also dated the day after the sighting,November 19th. The article describes much of what the previous article discussedwith additional details. The article discusses various reports of lights andobjects but adds “The most widely-reported configuration seen Tuesday night wasthat of a triangular shaped object with lights on each of the four [sic]corners, and a red light hanging down from the center on some type ofappendage.” One eyewitness account involved a Trenton resident by the name ofSteve Palmer. He had the advantage of observing the UFO through binoculars. Hedescribed the object as a triangle with three lights and a red light in thecenter. Of course, we have heard of this lighting configuration before. The article also stated that some eyewitnesses had reported seeing the UFO“jettison another flying craft while in midair.” This was followed up bymentioning another similar UFO sighting that same night near Moberly, Missouri(located 56 miles south of Kirksville). This report was courtesy of Bob Gribbleof Phenomena Research in Seattle, Washington. According to Gribble, “Two witnesses said it was similar in shape to a hugecigar with swept wings, and passed overhead with a rumbling sound. Then, aboutsix objects smaller than it flew out of an opening in the rear of the craft andflew off in opposite directions at high rates of speed.” This is reminiscent ofthe BOAC Stratocruiser incident of June 29th, 1954. The most comprehensive investigation on the incidents of November 18th wasconducted by the late Bob Pratt. At the time, Pratt was a reporter for theNational Enquirer. Pratt had over 40 years in the field of journalism workingfor various newspapers and publications prior to his employment with theNational Enquirer. He took special interest in investigating and accuratelyreporting UFO-related events. Pratt’s contributions to UFO research cannot beoverestimated. I am happy to have corresponded with him on my triangular UFOresearch prior to his death on November 21st, 2005. He encouraged me in myresearch and provided me with many case reports he personally investigated whichhe gave me permission to share. Pratt conducted numerous interviews with the witnesses from November 18th. OnFebruary 3rd, 1981, he published a one page article for the National Enquirerentitled “Hundreds Spot Gigantic UFO As It Cruises Over 2 States.” In thearticle, he recounts much of what we reviewed thus far, but added additionalwitness testimony. In reference to the size of the object, Pratt quoted a Mr. Don Leslie fromMilan, Missouri as saying “It was at least as big as a football field.” Anotherwitness who weighed in on the size of the object was Mr. Roger Bennett ofHuntsville, Missouri who said “It was so big it would make a B-52 bomber looklike a Piper Cub.” Again, it should be noted this was nine full years prior tothe Belgian wave of sightings. At this time, triangular UFOs of appreciable sizewere not commonly known to the general public. The article also discussed a Mr. Rick Hull who was able to snap a photo ofthe object as it flew over Trenton, Missouri. The photo revealed a triangulararrangement of lights, but no object. Hull stated the lights looked like a lightsource shining out of “windows to a cockpit.” This sentiment was shared by Mr.Buddy Hannaford of Trenton who said “They were like cabin lights, like lightscoming out of the windows of an airplane.” The following month, on December 10th, another multiple sighting caseoccurred. This time, the UFO was sighted around the city of Clifton, Arizona(located near the Arizona – New Mexico border). According to the December 17thedition of the Courier newspaper of Safford, Arizona, the sightings began around7:00 p.m. and were witnessed by scores of people whose descriptions coincidedwith one another. The impact of the sighting on witnesses in this case was pronounced. A localresident was quoted as saying “I was a non-believer until Wednesday night! Theobject that I saw was triangular in shape with several rows of lights. Itappeared to be reddish in color.” She indicated the object circled the town;departed to the east; then returned to circle the town and surrounding areas.She added that this cycle occurred several times. She further described theobject itself “It was very large, very low, and very quiet. The only sound Iheard was a soft dull jet-like sound, but it definitely was not a jet.” Around 8:00 p.m., the object made another approach over the city. An unnamedwitness stated the object “looked as big as the parking lot at the pit mine.”They added “There was no noise and it just seemed to float through the air.” Another witness, a lifelong resident of Clifton, said “Both my wife and I sawwhatever it was. We’re used to airplanes overhead day and night and this didn’teven move like a plane. Also, there was no sound.” His account varied a bit fromthe other witnesses in that he also described the object “to be shaped like akite or diamond.” Here is yet another “diamond-shaped” description associatedwith triangular UFO reports. He finished by stating “whatever it was (it) wastremendously big and the way the lights were spaced solidly there’s nopossibility that they were all on separate crafts.” The most striking characteristic in the article was that some of thewitnesses described the main object as a “mothership,” since two reportsdescribed smaller objects leaving the main object. One of the smaller objectsmoved off towards New Mexico and the other toward Safford. Later, they wereobserved to return to their original positions. This is certainly reminiscent ofthe reports from Missouri the month before. The correlation between the two maynot be a mere coincidence. An incident that sparked a flurry of news coverage in 1981 centered onWindsor, Vermont. The April 17th edition of Valley News in White River Junction,Vermont had the initial coverage. It discussed witnesses who came forward toreport sighting a triangular craft on April 15th. Linda Kingsbury, a business manager at the local public radio station, statedher and a co-worker, Lucy Slothower, noticed two bright lights in the sky around7:30 p.m. As the lights approached, they were clearly part of an object. Thisobject was described by the two women as triangular in shape; metallic inappearance; with additional lights on the underside. Kingsbury stated “As itwent over the top of us, this slow thing, there was a very heavy humming,droning (with) yellow and bluish lights filling in underneath.” They also notedred lights on the sides of the object. Additional witnesses were also quoted inthe article. A follow-up article was published by the same paper on April 22nd. Thearticle mentioned a man by the name of Eugene Fucci who claimed to havewitnessed the same UFO while driving near Mount Sunapee (located 25 miles to thesoutheast of Windsor). Fucci’s description tallied with the Windsor witnesses.He too stated the object initially looked like “two huge bright stars” to theeast. As it approached, the object resembled a huge metal triangle. He added itlooked like “five B-52s on a low altitude flight flying in a staggeredV-formation.” He added that it was flying “very low, lower than the hills.” Itpassed over Fucci’s car and headed west. The characteristic associated with the initial sighting of these objectsoften involves observation of two primary white lights. This is similar toseeing a car’s headlights. This was demonstrated in Red Wing, Minnesota;Kirksville/Trenton, Missouri; and the Windsor/Mount Sunapee, Vermont areasightings. These are just a few cases we have explored out of many others I havedocumented. Also, let us not forget Officer Ed Barton’s initial observation onJanuary 5th, 2000 near Lebanon, Illinois when he described two very bright whitelights with rays of light that resembled the “Japanese Rising Sun battle flag.” To underscore this fact, we only need look at a news article from the WhitbyGazette from North Yorkshire, England, dated November 12th, 1982. It describesthe latest UFO sighting in that area (exact date not given) as “a wide-basedtriangle shape with a domed covering.” The witness was a Mrs. Rachel Morton whosaw it pass overhead while waiting for a bus at approximately 6:15 p.m. As thearticle relates, “She first saw two small lights at the front, similar to carheadlights, just above housetop level.” It added, the object moved noiselesslyoverhead and the shape was unmistakable, since the streetlight shone upwardagainst its underbelly. The object was triangular and the back was curved wherethree larger lights were visible. This report from England was not the only one. On December 1st, theLincolnshire Daily Echo in Lincoln published another account of a triangular UFObeing sighted (no date/time given). The article related the sighting by a seniorCoastguard, Mr. Bernard O’Reilly, over the area of Skegness, a coastal town onthe North Sea. Bernard reported seeing “a lit up triangular craft” as thearticle put it. It was observed hovering for several minutes before movingsoundlessly in the direction of Hunstanton (a town located 18 miles to thesoutheast). As it hovered almost overhead, O’Reilly initially thought the objectmight be a Harrier jet. However, he immediately dismissed this since “It wasdeathly silent and on a calm clear night like that we would have heard theengines if it had been a jet.” Other residents came forward to local police toreport seeing the same thing. If England had sightings of triangular UFOs in 1982, it was only a preludefor what was to come the following year, 1983, in Cardiff, Wales. The first caseI came across garnered lots of media coverage. The incident in question occurredon January 19th around 7:00 p.m. The primary witness in this case was a Mrs.Carole Griffiths. The Cardiff newspaper, South Wales Echo, dated January 20th, ran the firststory documenting the events of the prior evening. The article starts bystating, “Reports of a giant triangular object hovering over South Wales aretoday being investigated by police.” The article continues by adding thedescription of the object matched that of six other people from Swansea (roughly40 miles to the northwest). Witnesses included two police detectives. The description of the UFO as stated in the article was that of “a gianttriangular-shaped object with white lights along the border of the triangle.” Itcontinued “Some reports say it was longer than a jumbo jet and had a red lightin the middle.” The report by Griffiths involved her along with her husband and a passengeras they were driving home. They noticed the large object in the sky and pulledtheir vehicle over to the side of the road. They then exited the vehicle to geta better look. Carole was quoted as saying “It looked like Concorde taking offbut it was stationary in the sky. I normally pooh-pooh things like that, but ithad to be a UFO.” The South Wales police also acknowledged receiving phone callsfrom citizens reporting UFOs that evening between 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. Asketch was provided by Carole of what they witnessed. The sightings that evening started in Swansea with the report of twodetectives who observed a silent triangular-shaped object. They estimate it was1,000 feet altitude with three lights. Two of these lights were reported topulsate. Most importantly, the detectives also reported a “smaller similarobject” that followed the initial one. It also noted the RAF had received twosuch reports as well. The January 21st edition of the South Wales Echo continued its news coverageof the event, but added additional eyewitnesses to the list. After their initial news storyran, other witnesses felt compelled to report their observations without fear ofridicule. In fact, one witness was quoted as saying “Until we saw the front pageof the Echo, I would have thought people would think I was some kind of a nut.” [images/00010.jpg]Witness sketch in South Wales Echo. The article goes on to rule out various conventional explanations for the UFOreports including helicopters, balloons, military refueling operations, andcommercial aircraft. To the last point, a witness even stated that whileobserving the UFO she also saw an aircraft fly by in the sky. She was able tocompare the speed of the two and indicated the UFO was moving very slowlyrelative to the aircraft. The South Wales Evening Post also reported on the local UFO activity in theirJanuary 21st edition. Specifically, the article interviews a witness, Mrs. JuneThomas, of Swansea. She discounted explanations offered by the local coastguardsthat the UFOs were simply attributed to meteors. She emphatically stated “What Isaw was [sic] two objects, very big objects, moving across the sky slowly andwithout any noise.” She added “Call them flying saucers if you will, but theywere definitely not planes or meteorites.” Thomas also provided a sketch of whatshe and others had witnessed over Swansea. [images/00023.jpg]Sketch by June Thomas of objects. Another witness interviewed was a Mr. John Owen who reportedly witnessed theUFOs over the town of Porthcawl (situated between Swansea and Cardiff). Hestated “What I saw was about 600 feet from the ground, huge in size and did nothave any engine noise, not like any civil or military aircraft I know. Besides,it was only moving at about 30 miles per hour, far too slow for an aircraft.” An RAF spokesman at the Ministry of Defence stated he had not yet receivedany official reports of the incident. He went on to speculate the sightingsmight have been attributed to planes flying in formation. This explanationdoesn’t seem to fit the eyewitness testimony. (See Appendix for MOD filesreferencing case) The January 24th edition of the South Wales Echo continued to report onadditional witnesses as they came forward with corroborative testimony. One thatstands out from the rest was a Mr. Joe Toland who was an aircraft engineer forthe RAF for fifteen years and was fortunate to see the UFO on the evening of the19th. He was coaching a soccer team when he and the team stopped to watch the UFOsoverhead. He was quoted in the article as follows “We stopped playing to watchit. I couldn’t fathom out why the lights were so far apart. It was close perhaps600 – 1,000 feet up. It must have been 300 feet across, so it could not be anaircraft. The thing I really don’t understand is that it made no noise.” Reports like these continued to be documented in subsequent newspaperarticles, specifically in the South Wales Echo through February of that year.Multiple witnesses came forward with similar testimony. All witnesses describinga huge triangular object flying silently overhead. These reports would bemirrored by reports over the State of New York in the United States startingaround this same time frame. We will briefly cover a few of the initial news reports concerning this waveof UFO sightings that became well known as the Hudson Valley UFO sightings. Forthose wishing to read more about this concentration of UFO activity, I refer youto the book Night Siege by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Philip Imbrogno, and Bob Pratt. As if to reinforce what we have explored thus far, it is worth quoting theintroduction to Chapter Two of Night Siege. It states “A triangular objectbigger than a football field that can hover silently or move ever so slowly –all very strange stuff. Yet it is not an unfamiliar story to UFO researchers.Similar sightings have been reported in Arkansas, Missouri, Arizona, Tennessee,and other states since the mid-1970s. Triangular-shaped UFOs have also beenreported in Great Britain and other countries.” As we have seen, these reportsgo back much further than the 1970s. Reports during this particular UFO wave consisted of “V” formations oflights; triangular objects; and boomerang or chevron-shaped objects beingsighted. The UFO reports poured in from the New York counties of Westchester,Putnam, and Dutchess as well as Fairfield, Litchfield, and New Haven counties inConnecticut. The wave occurred primarily from 1983 to 1986 with varyingintensity although there were some reports before and after this time period aswell. As the authors of Night Siege state at the beginning of Chapter Three, “March24, 1983 was one of the biggest nights for sightings.” Hundreds of sightingswere generated that evening around the cities of Yorktown and New Castle in theHudson River Valley area. The majority of witnesses described a “V” shaped arrayof lights moving very slowly and silently overhead. At times the lights appearedto hover. One of the local news articles that carried initial coverage was published bythe Patent Trader of Mt. Kisco (later merged into the Journal News). Theirarticle published the following day, March 25th, described the initialsightings. It stated that reports covered the area from Yorktown to White Plainsshortly before 9:00 p.m. Both citizens as well as police officers were witnessto the spectacle. Observers described an “arrowhead or V-shaped array containing‘green and white lights’ (that) made no noise and ‘hovered’. It moved veryslowly.” One witness stated she and others watched the lights that alternated betweengreen and white move from the south; return to its original position; thenzigzag toward the north. Police were interviewed in addition to the supervisorof the Westchester County Airport. He didn’t know what the lights were butsuggested they might be private planes flying together in a tight formation.This explanation would be offered for the sightings then as well as years later.Indeed, some private planes did appear to be doing this in the area, but itcannot be accepted as an explanation for all of the reports, since manywitnesses distinctly reported a solid mass behind the lights complete withstructural details. In the March 31st issue of the Reporter Dispatch newspaper of White Plains,New York, Philip Imbrogno was interviewed regarding the sightings that had beenoccurring for the last week or so. He stated the lights closely resemble anumber of sightings reported in that same area in the years 1976, 1977, and1980. He added that this type of report “falls into one of the major types ofUFO shape that has been reported over the years.” In the April 3rd issue of the Herald Statesman newspaper of Yonkers, NewYork, Imbrogno was quoted as saying, “The majority of the sightings indicatedthe object was 500 to 1,000 feet up, and most people say it was so slow theycould catch up to it. A number reported seeing a structure, some kind of grayshape.” This same article also mentions that some witnesses described five separateplanes in formation with the characteristic sound of propellers. Yet, othersreported a single wedge-shaped object very close to their position that had thecapability to hover and dart off in a manner unlike any aircraft. You be thejudge. Later, in another edition of the Herald Statesman dated May 22nd, Imbrognowas interviewed and shared additional eyewitness testimony and discussed howtheir investigative efforts were doing. He believed there were at least twoseparate UFOs operating in the area. “One object is described astriangular-shaped. A wide V about 300 feet long. The other is described asboomerang-shaped…about 150 feet long, end-to-end.” He discussed his summation of interviews with the witnesses from March 24th.He stated “They reported this enormous thing, silent, hovering over their homesfor 45 minutes. It was 70 feet in the air, hovering, and made right angleturns.” An airplane that silently hovers for 45 minutes is hard to imagine. Some of the most serious reports documented by the authors involved a largetriangular UFO hovering over the Indian Point nuclear power plant located inBuchanan, New York. The initial report came from a New York State PowerAuthority security officer who indicated a UFO hovered 300 feet over one of thereactor’s exhaust towers for at least ten minutes on July 24th, 1984.Investigators would later confirm the report and interview multiple securityofficers and local residents who all testified to seeing a UFO over thefacility. [images/00041.jpg]Indian Point UFO from Night Siege. The situation raised security concerns at the facility, since this wasobviously an unidentified flying object that was hovering over a nuclear reactorin an area that is designated as restricted airspace. The authors of Night Siegedocumented this aspect quite well in their discussion of the case. In addition,they learned of a similar event that occurred there on June 14th. The witnessesprovided the following sketch to investigators. While the sightings persisted in New York State, triangular UFO reportscontinued in England as well. The Bolton Evening News described a sighting intheir February 16th, 1984 edition. This sighting involved 24-year-old StuartSettle, who was in Bolton at the time of his sighting. The paper relates thatSettle observed a UFO near Horwich College as he was walking home (no date/timegiven). He described a triangular-shaped object that was seen to tilt, hover,and change direction as its five lights flashed continually. Once he arrivedhome, his 20-year-old brother observed it as well. Settle was quoted as saying“I used to think it (UFOs) was all a load of rubbish, but now!” The following year in 1985, the Leicester Mercury newspaper published anarticle discussing multiple triangular UFO sightings in the area. In theirDecember 2nd edition, it stated “Apparently since early August there have beenmany sightings of a triangular shaped object with unusual lights.” It referenceda sighting by two police officers in the village of Long Clawson (roughly 20miles northeast of Leicester) on September 27th of that year. The article goes on to mention investigations underway by the Leicester UFOInvestigation Centre based in Leicester. Also, Centre investigators noted therecent sightings were very similar to 67 sighting reports obtained from theOctober 23, 1978 sightings in the area. The Cardiff sighting description from 1983 was echoed in a 1987 sighting overWolverhampton. In the November 21st edition of the Wolverhampton Express Star,the article title reads “Mystery of ‘Concorde shape UFO’.” The sightingsoccurred around 7:00 p.m. (no exact date is given). Businessman Jim Dawes wasone of the witnesses who came forward. At first, he thought the lights henoticed in the sky belonged to a small aircraft landing at a nearby airfield. Headded “When it got closer it looked like two planes flying side-by-side. Butthere were too many different lights in a triangle shape. It looked like theoutline of Concorde.” He added “It just glided overhead.” On December 10th, the Nottingham Evening Post ran a story entitled “Mysteryof City UFO Sightings” that described the mass sighting of a UFO over the citythe night prior. Unfortunately, the description is lacking in the article. Itdescribes the UFO as “strange lights in the sky on an object the size of afootball pitch [soccer field], travelling very slowly and accompanied by a deephum.” Inquiries made with various military and aviation authorities met with noanswers. Despite the absence of the object’s shape being described, it ispossible the sighting involved a triangular UFO as we will see shortly. The nextsighting occurred roughly 70 miles northeast of Nottingham. The Hull Daily Mail dated December 11th described a number of UFO reportsmade in the area. In one case, police were contacted by a man who claimed tohave witnessed a triangular UFO estimated to be 250 feet long (no date given).He witnessed this over a farm and stated it was covered in roughly 150 red andwhite lights. He also said it was making a roaring noise. Due to the proximity(by air) of the last sighting and the timing of both articles separated by justone day, it could be surmised the same thing was observed in both locales. In addition, we have another article that confirms triangular UFOs werefrequenting the skies over Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Leicestershire, andDerbyshire around this timeframe. This, according to the Long Eaton Trader,dated December 23rd. The article focuses on investigations by Dennis Harriman,member of the National UFO Investigation Society. The reports received by Harriman all tallied with one another. The reportsinvolved a large triangular object with multiple lights. The object wasdescribed as the size of a football pitch. The object reportedly moved veryslowly and emitted a deep hum. One witness, Edward Fell, said he parked and exited his car to view theobject (no date given). He stated “The impression I got was that it wastremendous. I knew it was huge – 20 to 30 times the size of a normal aircraft.And it made a distinctive deep throbbing noise.” To illustrate Fell’s andother’s descriptions, Long Eaton Trader artist, Paul Moran, provided a drawing. [images/00055.jpg]Sketch by Paul Moran. Sightings of triangular UFOs would continue to frequent skies over Englandinto the following year. The Stafford Newsletter of May 20th, 1988 quoted famedUFO researcher Jenny Randles as stating “We’ve had quite a spate of these in theMidlands, about a dozen since December.” The article focused on the recentsighting by a Mrs. Eileen Ballard of two triangular UFOs flying together. Ballard and four friends were outside in Stafford around 10:00 p.m. on May16th when they initially noticed two spotlights in the sky. She added “Theybanked over and went into side by side formation, one above the other, and flewslowly across the sky without any noise at all.” She added “They flew very closetogether and were triangular in shape…There were a lot of lights underneath, redand green, around the edge(s) and within that lots (of) others.” A sketch wasprovided by Ballard to better illustrate her sighting. [images/00020.jpg]Sketch by Eileen Ballard. At the time, investigators from the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA)were quoted in the article as attributing the sighting to two top secret UnitedStates Air Force Stealth Fighters, despite the complete absence of sound noted.At the time, the official designation for this aircraft was not known and it wasbeing erroneously referred to as the “F-19.” The article also had the Assistant Editor, Mike Daly, of Jane’s DefenceWeekly, weigh in on the matter. He acknowledged rumors of American StealthFighters being based and flown in England, but added “But two together all litup over a populated area would seem very odd, though I suppose they would needlights if their flight path wasn’t generally known. Even so, I’d think it wouldmake more sense to fly them over the North Sea.” I would personally have toagree with Mr. Daly’s statements. This case would draw lots of media attention as well as the attention of alocal government official. The July 1st edition of the Stafford Newsletter ranthe article entitled “After MP’s (Minister of Parliament) plea, more tell of UFOMystery.” It states that Stafford MP, Bill Cash, would be presenting the caseinformation to Defence Minister, Roger Freeman, for “official investigation.” The article also describes the sighting details of two additional witnessesfrom Stafford. Michael Acocks and his wife, Joan, were walking on the evening ofMay 16th when they noticed two triangular shapes hovering over some nearby treesat 9:50 p.m. Mrs. Acocks was quoted as saying “I stood there looking and all ofa sudden it just disappeared. I stood there for a while and then it appearedagain exactly as before in the same place, hovering for a few seconds before itdisappeared again and we walked on.” She added “What struck me more thananything was that it was absolutely silent.” Another witness mentioned was Elaine Willacy. She, along with two neighbors,viewed the objects through binoculars and stated that the sketch previouslypublished was very accurate. She added that no identification markings were seenon the objects that might suggest military (American or otherwise). She said “Itwas going very slowly and seemed in no rush to go anywhere. It felt as thoughsomeone was looking down on us and taking pictures.” The absence of sound wasalso again noted. Newspaper reports continued until at least September of 1988 regarding thesesightings over Stafford. Additional witnesses came forward with similareyewitness testimony. All of the witnesses were consistent in their details.Despite the apparent ability of these objects to hover; disappear thenre-appear; and move directly overhead with complete absence of sound; BUFORAmaintained their position that the source of these UFOs were most likelyAmerican Stealth Fighters. This was a logical and down-to-Earth explanation,since we didn’t have any definitive details regarding these aircraft at thetime. Now, after more than twenty years of public disclosure, we know withcertainty the flight capabilities of the F-117 Stealth Fighter. Namely, itcannot hover, magically disappear then re-appear, or move silently. Despite thetechnological innovations of the time, this aircraft still had flight dynamicssimilar to conventional aircraft. One final item worth mentioning is that theF-117 was officially acknowledged and unveiled in November of that same year. The UFO activity continued unabated into 1989 in England as evidenced by anews article in the Southend Evening Echo from Essex dated January 6th. Thearticle started off with the words “More triangular craft have been reported inthe South East Essex skies.” It recounted the sighting by a woman and her sonwho were walking their dog (no date given). They described a triangular craftwith green and white flashing lights. They also noted a large spotlight thatextinguished when an aircraft passed overhead then came on again after theaircraft departed. The craft moved slowly and the witnesses noticed red lightson the rear of the object. The Essex Chronicle, out of Chelmsford, ran a news story in their February 17edition, which continued to document the drama in the skies. It reviewed recentreports from the area and stated “On January 28 a triangular or shield-shapedUFO was sighted over the Tiptree area in the evening. It’s [sic] colour changedfrom bright to a dull white before it shot across the sky towards Chelmsford.”References were made to two additional triangular UFO sightings in January (nodates provided). On February 24th, the Wilts & Gloucester Standard of Cirencester ran a storyentitled “UFO or a plane?” The article discusses the prevalence of UFO reportsin that area as being triangular, noiseless, and “ablaze with lights.” Thearticle mentioned some of the recent sightings and added that one reportdescribed a series of light beams emanating from the UFO towards the ground thatgave it a “tripod effect.” Additional reports of this nature would continue to pour in from citizensacross England in 1989. In retrospect, I think it is safe to say that this waveof sightings would serve as a prelude for the Belgian UFO wave starting onNovember 29th of that year. Indeed, the similarities in these reports cannot beignored. In recognizing these similarities, it underscores the idea that we aredealing with objects based in fact – not fantasy. As previously mentioned, the Belgian military thought they were confronting agenuine phenomenon when attempting to investigate these reports from 1989 to1991. But what types of military cases exist prior to this timeframe thatprovide additional information for our analysis? Chapter 6:Military Reports One of the earliest and most comprehensive collections of military reportsinvolving UFOs that have been made available to the public is the United StatesAir Force’s Project Blue Book files. The project ran from March 1952 to Decemberof 1969. Two previous projects, Sign and Grudge, ran from January 1948 toFebruary 1949 and February 1949 to March 1952, respectively. Herein, we willrefer to all of these projects under the umbrella title of Project Blue Book. Intotal, the three projects documented 12,618 UFO sightings. Of these, 701remained “unidentified” despite attempts to explain them all away inconventional terms. Despite the skewed conclusions that favored prosaic explanations,documentation of the actual UFO sightings is of historical value. It serves as atestament to what was being reported in the early years of this phenomenon. Likenewspaper reporters, the Blue Book investigators took the time to verify thewitnesses’ identities and interviewed them. Again, this adds a level ofcredibility to the reports in that the sources have been verified. However, theveracity or accuracy of the reporting may still be questioned. Similar to our review of newspaper and other printed reports, we see arecurring pattern of triangular UFO sightings in the Blue Book files. However,these reports are a distinct minority compared to the ubiquitous “flying saucer”sightings documented especially in the early years of the project. Again, itmust be emphasized that the reports we will review are only a fraction of thebest cases involving triangular UFO reports that exist in the Blue Book files.There are many others, but we do not have the space to review them here. One of the first well-documented cases involved multiple eyewitnesses fromBaltimore, Maryland referenced as “Incident 398.” Shortly after 6:30 p.m. onJune 29, 1949, a former Air Force Tech Sergeant and World War 2 veteran observedthree separate flights of three V-shaped or triangular-shaped objects. At thetime, he was sitting on his front porch as he would often do and was observingclouds in the sky when the mystery objects came into view. Initially, he thoughtthey might be Maryland National Guard planes. However, this idea quickly fadedwhen he observed the objects veer sharply into a cloud and then proceed to flyaround the cloud repeatedly. For two hours he observed this spectacle. Overtime, the objects increased to an estimated fifteen to twenty in number. During this time, the primary witness’ wife and over a dozen neighbors cameoutside to view the spectacle. After the first half hour, he contacted theBaltimore News Post to see if they could have a reporter come to the location toverify and document the objects’ presence. They did not dispatch a reporter, butdid contact the Baltimore Municipal Airport who stated there were no knownaircraft in that area at that time. The man then grabbed his binoculars in the hope of identifying the objects inquestion. He fully acknowledged the task was difficult due to the rapid natureof their flight. However, he stated “The best description that I can give of theobjects is that they resembled a boomerang which had been pulled out. Actually,they were an open angular, with the vertex angle approximately 70 degrees; thelegs of the angle had some thickness, but there was no evidence of engines,fuselage, canopies, landing gear, or other conventional aircraft construction.”As a commercial art student, he provided a sketch to investigators to illustratethe event. He continued his description by adding “The objects were black in color, witha dull sheen that showed no sun reflection. I was extremely impressed by thehigh degree of maneuverability and the terrific rate of speed at which theobjects appeared to be traveling. The objects seemed to possess the ability toreverse their course 180 degrees instantaneously.” This characteristic has beendescribed in many later triangular UFO cases, but this was 1949 and we hadnothing that could make such a maneuver at such high speed. [images/00052.jpg]Sketch of objects over Baltimore, 1949. The rapid nature of flight was noted throughout the episode. In addition toflying around the cloud, which investigators noted the base to be 2,500 feetaltitude, the objects reportedly were zipping in and out of it with equal speedand precision. During this time period, the formation slowly moved from thesoutheast to the northeast before it was out of sight. Despite the incredible nature of this report, a few points are worth noting.The report is quoted as saying the witness “stated that during the time he flewas a field gunner in the Air Force he observed airplanes from a distance andbirds in flight many, many times, and he was absolutely positive that what hesaw on the afternoon of 29 June 1949 was not something he had witnessed beforein his life.” Adding to this was the “Agent’s Note” by the investigating AirForce officer which states the witness “appears to be a very well-educated,intelligent, conscientious individual, and gives the impression of fullsincerity in the report of this matter.” One final note on this case involves the fact that over fifteen additionalwitnesses corroborated the lead witness’ account and were interviewed at lengthby two investigating Air Force officers. All descriptions tallied with theinitial report. Another dramatic incident involving multiple eyewitnesses occurred during theNATO exercise known as Operation or Exercise Mainbrace. This was a joint navaloperation that was conducted in September of 1952 involving nine countriesincluding the United States and England. The operations area consisted of theNorth, Baltic, Norwegian, and Barents Sea. On the night of September 13th, the first in a series of UFO sightingsoccurred. While north of Bornholm Island, Lieutenant Commander G. Schmidt-Jensenon board the Danish naval destroyer, Willemoes, observed a “flying luminoustriangle” according to military reports. He, along with additional officers,were on the bridge when they heard a whistling sound and saw a “flying triangle”pass overhead at high speed. Schmidt-Jensen stated “It was luminous, with a greenish light, and flew withone corner pointing forward. From its rear it jetted three rays of firebackwards. I have no idea how high it was so that I could not judge either itssize or speed, but I believe it went at more than 1,500 kilometers an hour. Itdisappeared in a north-westerly direction. I have studied some astronomy and Ihave also learned to identify most of the modern planes and I am sure it wasneither.” In later reports, he also noted the object could not have been ameteor. Subsequent to this sighting, there were at least four other UFO sightings inthis military operations area that month. The reports varied with regard to theobjects being seen. However, this was the only report involving a triangularUFO. The reports were taken seriously by military command staff and wereforwarded to Mainbrace headquarters in Copenhagen for evaluation (see Appendixfor copy of news teletype). Another dramatic encounter took place in the skies over Albany, Georgia onJanuary 28th, 1953. This incident involved an Air Force pilot flying an F-86Sabre jet. At 9:35 p.m., he was flying level at 6,000 feet altitude when henoticed a bright white light at his ten o’clock high position. He noted that itwas unusually bright and seemed to have a defined circular shape as opposed to apinpoint of light like a star. After a time, he decided to close in on the light for a better look. As heincreased his altitude, he realized in three to four minutes that he was nowabove the light. This was no star or planet. He then made a descent towards theobject. As he approached, the white light was getting larger. The light thenchanged its color to red then back to white in the span of about two seconds.This occurred repeatedly two or three times in rapid succession then culminatedin the light changing into a perfect triangle. As soon as he was able to processwhat happened, the triangle then split into two triangles, one above the other.Then both triangles suddenly disappeared. The witness stated “It was just likesomeone turning off a light – it’s there, then it’s gone.” The fact that the object appeared to change shape is something we have heardof before in other cases. In addition, the fact that two triangular UFOs weresighted together is another aspect that has been documented elsewhere. Finally,the ability to vanish instantaneously is not without precedence either. Theseand other aspects we will explore in greater detail in the next chapter. An important wave of triangular UFO sightings occurred over Denmark fromNovember of 1957 into 1958 that captured the attention of the Danish DefenseIntelligence Service. These were well-documented by military officials as wellas the Danish newspaper, B-T. Due to their place in our historical chronology,let’s examine these further. The newspaper, B-T, in its April 16th, 1958 edition stated “Triangular spaceships have also now appeared in the southern part of Jutland. From every partcome reports of mysterious phenomena in the sky towards the late evening. Allwitnesses state with certainty that conventional aircraft are not involved.” Itfurther noted “So many reports of a similar nature have been sent to the AirForce Station of Skrydstrup that they have been unable to cope with them all andmore are expected in the near future.” As if to bolster this newspaper report, I came across a Reuters news articledated just three days later, April 19th, entitled “Spaceship over Denmark.” Thisarticle recounted the sighting by a woman on April 15th, 1958 near the town ofBroager in south Jutland. She described the low-flying triangular object shewitnessed as big and black. Further, she noted as it flew over Broager a numberof horseshoe-shaped objects “emitting a strong light” emerged from the largecraft. The woman’s account was corroborated by approximately twenty otherwitnesses in the area who reported seeing “a triangular spaceship” in the samearea at the same time. This last report made its way into the Project Blue Book files and is theonly reference there to this dramatic wave of sightings. Luckily, we have theaforementioned newspaper report that shed additional insight into the events ofthat time. Most interesting is the reference to objects emerging from thetriangular object in question. Of course this harkens back to the BOACStratocruiser incident of June 29, 1954 over Labrador as well as other caseson-file. The UFO wave over Denmark apparently began in November of 1957.Coincidentally, a series of triangular UFO sightings occurred and weredocumented in the Blue Book files that took place along the Illinois / Wisconsinborder around this same timeframe on the night of November 5th, 1957. Is thisjust another mere coincidence? As noted on the report cover page, there werethree UFO incidents reported on the night of November 5th. The items listed as“1” and “2” are the ones of interest to us. [images/00072.jpg]Project Bluebook Report referencing three UFO sightings, November 5, 1957. The first event occurred over the city of Woodstock, Illinois around 8:43p.m. and involved the sighting of a large, triangular red object. As noted, theobject had a green light in the front and was yellow or gray in the rear. Iwould assume they were referencing a gray surface and yellow light, but thereport is ambiguous at best and no firm conclusion can be drawn based on thelimited data. Also, noted is the description of a “low droning sound.” Finally,it indicates a direction of flight from “west to east and vice versa along theIllinois / Wisconsin border.” Keep this in mind later when we examine theirconclusions. The second event references a triangular object that was amber or orange incolor seen over Delavan, Wisconsin around 10:15 p.m. Most important is thereference to the size of the object – two hundred feet in length. This sizeestimate correlates quite well with the Dutch East Indies’ reports of 1890 orthose of Belgium in 1989 to 1991 or even those from southern Illinois on January5, 2000. The duration of the sighting was five minutes. This is not only another example of triangular UFO reports, but is an exampleof the poor quality of documentation and questionable conclusions made byProject Blue Book in many cases. Let’s look at the issues related to thisreport. The first incident from Woodstock, Illinois did not solely consist of asighting in Woodstock. On the half page devoted to this report it states acivilian in Genoa City, Wisconsin was an eyewitness to the UFO. Moreimportantly, it notes that Woodstock, Illinois police officers saw the object aswell. The significance of this is not just that there were multiple witnessesfrom varying locations, but that Woodstock, Illinois is located approximatelytwenty miles to the southwest of Genoa City. Add to this the second incidentfrom Delavan, Wisconsin. Delavan is located approximately twenty five miles tothe northwest of Genoa City. When analyzed the data suggests these were possiblylinked events that occurred within a 50-mile radius within one and a half hoursof each other. Now we come to the conclusion drawn by Blue Book investigators. As shown onthe report’s cover page, the conclusion for the source of the sightings wasastronomical. Specifically, it was all due to an aurora according to Blue Bookinvestigators. For quick review, an aurora consists of charged particles thatcollide with atoms in our upper atmosphere to create beautiful light displays.For most people, this is known more commonly as the aurora borealis or northernlights. This so-called conclusion unfortunately doesn’t match the eyewitnesstestimony. Witnesses described a specific geometric shape and noted in one casea “low droning sound.” In addition, a direction of flight was indicated. Thisdoesn’t fit the nature of an aurora which appears silently as a transientshimmering spectrum of light. Compounded with this is the inconsistency within Blue Book’s own report. Onthe subsequent pages, references are made suggesting what was sighted overWoodstock and Delavan were jet aircraft. Sketches are provided showing thelighting patterns of particular jet aircraft. A notation next to one such sketchand the reference to Genoa City are scribbled the words “right under airway”suggesting the location is in an active flight path. Yet, the final conclusionis listed as “Was Astronomical – Aurora.” If the events over the Illinois / Wisconsin border were explained away as anaurora, I would enjoy seeing the Air Force investigators stretch thatexplanation to fit an event that occurred the very next day over Padang inCentral Sumatra, Indonesia. [images/00024.jpg]Air Intelligence Report on UFO sighting over Indonesia, 1957. This event occurred on the evening of November 6th, 1957 around 5:00 p.m. andinvolved two fishermen. It serves as one of the strangest accounts we willreview. Due to the prevalence of triangular UFO reports both in the UnitedStates as well as Denmark during this same timeframe, we should not bepredisposed to discount this event due to its high-strangeness. Also, if theaccount is true and accurate, it serves as the one and only instance where atriangular UFO may have been observed in a state of emergency. I include it herein its entirety. We now move forward to the year 1966. A Blue Book case that deservesattention occurred over Elmer, New Jersey on December 15th of that year.According to Blue Book, there was “insufficient data for evaluation” regardingthis case. The documentation consists of a letter from the primary witness whichwe now quote: > “On December 15, 1966 I saw a U.F.O. My sister also saw the object. After you> have read the data given below, if you have any questions ask them through the> mail or contact me through my school. If you have any logical explanation,> please send it to me in the mail. My mother objects completely to my> discussing this sighting to anyone. I would gladly submit to a lie detector> test.> The first sighting took place on December 15, 1966 between 5:30 & 6:00 p.m.> The object appeared to be triangular (in) shape and three lights were going on> & off. The object’s thickness appeared to be small when compared to the length> of aside [sic]. Four people were in the car which was approximately 6 miles> from Woodstown in a southeasterly direction. The car was approaching Woodstown> at about 50 miles per hour. The object was going in the opposite direction at> about the speed of a blimp. The distance the object was away was about 3 to 10> miles depending on its size, which was hard to determine. The second sighting> took place between 6:15 and 6:45 p.m. on the way leaving Woodstown in a> southeasterly direction. This time the car was almost passed over by the> object. The shape was very clear, you will find a drawing enclosed. The major> visible shape is covered in the drawing. I saw no large extensions nor minor> extensions. Attached on another sheet you will find a Personal Data Sheet. I> hope this sheet helps you realize that I have an above average intellect and> that I am not subject to hallucinations.” The witness then provided his sketch. The rounded corners are an aspect seenin many other cases. The reference to three lights does not go into detail, butwe must consider the possibility of the lights being positioned at the threepoints of the UFO as characterized in numerous other reports such as our nextcase. [images/00034.jpg]Witness sketch of object over Elmer, New Jersey, 1966. This brings us to one last Blue Book case in our review of military reports.This case occurred over northern Woodstock, Connecticut on February 10th, 1967.The report appears to have been a civilian investigative report that Blue Bookincluded in their files. They would often do this in addition to includingnewspaper and magazine references to UFO sightings in their case reports. The one page report lists three witnesses to this event. The time of thesighting occurred between 5:30 and 5:45 p.m. The apparent size of the UFO waslisted as “”larger” than a full moon. It was estimated to be 1,000 feet inaltitude. It was observed to the south of the witness’ location and appeared tomove from the northeast to the southwest. The object itself was described as a“dark outline” with a bright white light at each point of the triangle. It wasdescribed as silent when hovering, but it had a low rumbling sound when itmoved. Most intriguing was the apparent flight of this object, since itreportedly “moved with its blunt end or base forward and its pointed end or apextrailing.” Suggestions were made that there may have been electromagneticeffects associated with the family’s television set when the UFO passed by aswell. The following sketch was also provided.[images/00054.jpg]Sketch of object over Woodstock, Connecticut, 1967. On December 17th, 1969, Project Blue Book was terminated, much to the delightof Air Force officials. For years, the Project was more of a public relationsfront as opposed to a true scientific investigation of the UFO phenomenon. Theconclusions of the Project were as follows: > 1. No UFO reported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force was ever an> indication of threat to our national security.> 2. There was no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that> sightings categorized as \"unidentified\" represented technological developments> or principles beyond the range of modern scientific knowledge.> 3. There was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as> \"unidentified\" were extraterrestrial vehicles. It is interesting to note, despite these conclusions, that the United StatesAir Force has been involved in UFO cases subsequent to the termination ofProject Blue Book as revealed by declassified documents. It might be due in-partto the statement made in another declassified document dated October 20th, 1969.This document is known as the “Bolender memo” named after the man who draftedit, Air Force Brigadier General, C.H. Bolender. The memo lays out the history of the Air Force in its dealings with the UFOsituation for the past 21 years. The purpose of the memo was to recommend thetermination of Project Blue Book. It further states that “Moreover, reports ofunidentified flying objects which could affect national security…are not part ofthe Blue Book system.” Later it restates this position “However, as alreadystated, reports of UFOs which could affect national security would continue tobe handled through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose.” Is it then a surprise that one of Blue Book’s conclusions was that “No UFOreported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force was ever an indication ofthreat to our national security”? If all cases that posed such a threat werediverted away from Blue Book, of course they found no such indication of this.There have been various interpretations of this memo, but some think it shedslight on the UFO situation and Blue Book’s relationship with the phenomenon inthe late 1960s. Despite the United States wanting to (officially) distance themselves fromthe UFO subject, their counterparts in England decided to continue theircollection of UFO reports as they had done since 1950. In fact, a Ministry ofDefence (MOD) memo dated December 16th, 1971 stated “When the USAF announced inDecember 1969 the termination of Project Blue Book…the MOD position concerningUFO investigations was reviewed. It was decided early in 1970 that our policiesand procedures for dealing with these reports should continue unchanged.” Like their American counterparts, the British MOD had amassed quite acollection of reports involving UFOs that varied as much as the witnesses whofiled them. Objects of all shapes, sizes, and colors were reported anddocumented. In the midst of these reports, there were an ever-growing number oftriangular UFO reports. However, it wasn’t until the 1980s that this subset ofreports became more and more prevalent. A brief one page report alludes to a UFO sighting that occurred betweenRoyton and Oldham in Greater Manchester in December 1981. It references atriangular UFO that apparently altered its size. It also described the UFO ashaving a light on each corner of the triangle. Further still, one of the lightsreportedly detached itself from the object and flew off. There are certainlysome familiar characteristics mentioned in this case that we have and will seein other cases. Two years later, in December 1983, a similar UFO was observed by a witnesswho was walking his dogs at Sherlocks Farm in Groombridge, Sussex. This UFO hadan orange light at each apex of the triangle. In addition, this UFO made a lowdroning sound as it passed by the witness. The incident was reported to thelocal police. One month later, another report was filed involving a triangular UFO overGuilford, Surrey in January of 1984. This object had an escort. The reportdescribed the luminous triangle being preceded by a flashing light. In thiscase, the object was silent as it traveled to the east. A most bizarre case in the MOD files described the sighting of a“sausage-shaped object” in October of 1985. The sighting occurred in Frenchairspace and was reported by the pilot of a Cessna 421. The pilot observed theUFO and described it as large and black. It was located at the pilot’s 12o’clock position. He observed this object for ten minutes before it “split intotwo triangular shaped objects” and disappeared. The sighting was initiallyreported to Marseilles Air Traffic Control. This is reminiscent of the Sabre jetsighting over Albany, Georgia on January 28th, 1953. The year 1986 was a good year for triangular UFO reports in the MOD files.One case report in particular, dated March 18th, was referred to the Royal AirForce (RAF) West Drayton from the Maindee Police Station located in Newport,South Wales. The report detailed the sighting of two triangular UFOs the “pointsof which were facing in the same direction with a constant distance betweenthem.” The size of the objects was described as “a few hundred yards long.” Itfurther stated the “first triangle consisted of multi-coloured lights which werecovering the entire area.” The second one “had three lights at each point.” Another incident report dated May 6th described a number of unusual aspectscharacteristic of other cases. The witnesses were driving from the seaside townof Worthing to Billingshurst in West Sussex when they observed a somewhattriangular-shaped object described as a “trapezium-shaped object.” This oddityreportedly had “two square lights at front and two green lights and centre redlight at rear.” It was also associated with a dull humming sound. The witnessesdescribed this thing as hovering over the road then zigzagging across the roadbehind their car. They stopped their vehicle at which point the object camestraight at them. It then turned while above them and proceeded in the directionof Guildford to the north. One aspect of the British MOD files was their tendency to incorporatecivilian UFO group reports and newsletters into their files much like theirAmerican Blue Book counterparts. A dramatic series of sightings was documentedby the Plymouth UFO Research Group (PUFORG) in a memo dated August 29, 1987.Below are segments of this memo: > “I am compiling a full report on a sighting of two very large UFOs, which were> seen, by what I estimate to have been hundreds of people, in Plymouth alone.> These UFOs made successive passes over the city between the hours of 10:30> p.m. and 2:00 a.m. on the evening of the 4/5th of August… A feature of the> incident that I am finding hard to clarify is the height at which the objects> were flying and their size. While flying over Plymouth, the witnesses here> (myself included) felt that they were at a height of something between ¼ and a> ½ a mile, and apparently the size of a jumbo jet. However the two delta shaped> objects were seen at the same time in the Plymouth direction, from Bude on the> north coast, a distance of 40 miles away. The Bude sighting was by an RAF> wartime navigator, who states that he has never seen anything like them in all> his years associated with planes and flying…Believe me this was avery [sic]> impressive ‘display’ by a very impressive unknown flying aircraft.” One final note on this report was that references were made to the apparentsighting of the same objects 30 minutes prior over the city of Exeter in Devonlocated roughly 50 miles to the northeast. In this instance, the objectsreportedly were tracked on radar by local Air Traffic Control. As previouslymentioned, if this account is valid then there must have been a multitude ofwitnesses. A little over a month later, another sighting occurred on September, 30th asdocumented in an MOD report dated October 5th. This event was reported to theTaunton Police Department in Somerset prior to the MOD being notified. Thetriangular object was observed by three witnesses who described bright whitelights at each point in addition to red lights underneath it. The size wasestimated to be comparable to three C-130 aircraft (which has a length of 97feet 9 inches and a wingspan of 132 feet 7 inches). The object was reported torotate to the left as it was being observed. Another significant report surfaced regarding two triangular UFOs and hassimilarities to the Newport, South Wales case from 1986 mentioned earlier. Thisincident occurred around 9:45 p.m. on the evening of May16th, 1988 and involvedmultiple witnesses in the area of Stafford. In fact, we previously covered thiscase in referencing the July 1st edition of the Stafford Newsletter, the articleentitled “After MP’s plea, more tell of UFO Mystery.” It stated that StaffordMP, Bill Cash, would be presenting the case information to Defence Minister,Roger Freeman, for “official investigation.” Multiple reports were in fact sentto the MOD courtesy of William Cash. The following are some of those. One witness stated the UFOs were below the height that a microlight aircraftwould fly and there was no noise detectable. The objects moved slowly towardsher and five other witnesses and then turned around. She indicated that a normalplane would not have “banked” in the same way suggesting something out of theordinary with regard to its movement. Another witness was walking her dog with her son-in-law who was a policeofficer at 9:30 p.m. when they both observed two headlights moving towards them.They stated there was no sound. As they passed both of them overhead, there wasa mass of lights on the underside of both. The objects moved slowly and in aneasterly direction. Another group of eyewitnesses described seeing the objects at approximately10 p.m. They described two delta-shaped objects coming from the south thatturned towards the southeast. The objects were flying silently together at anestimated 5,000 feet altitude and made no sound. The most detailed account came from an eyewitness who observed the objectsfor an estimated four minutes. At first, the witness sighted two bright lightsvery low on the horizon at approximately 9:40 p.m. The lights were seen in ahorizontal position to one another, but steadily shifted to a vertical position.These lights dimmed as they approached the witness. Then numerous colored lightsbecame visible. As the objects flew directly overhead, the witness could see“two perfect triangles” in line with one another. There was a faint soundnoticeable. The object eventually disappeared from view. The witness also addedsome closing remarks. “I know of no plane that can manoeuvre in this manner atsuch a slow speed. The triangles were equal in size and the distance apart didnot fluctuate at all. If it had not been in the air I would have said that itcould not fly at all.” A sketch was provided of the sighting. [images/00059.jpg]Sketch of object over New South Wales, 1986. Triangular UFO reports continued to flood into the MOD from the 1980s to the1990s. However, it wasn’t until January 6th, 1995 when England was presentedwith one of the most sobering UFO encounters. This case involved thenear-collision of a commercial airliner and a triangular UFO! British Airways Flight 5061 from Milan was making its final approach towardsManchester Airport as it flew over the Pennine Mountains of North CentralEngland. The time was 6:48 p.m. as the Boeing 737 passenger plane was 8 to 9miles outside of Manchester and flying north at 4,000 feet altitude. In thecockpit were the pilot, Captain Roger Wills and his First Officer, Mark Stuart.Sixty passengers were on board. This seemingly uneventful flight was about tochange. As the two men were involved with their normal operations, their attentionwas quickly diverted to the sight of a lighted object moving in the oppositedirection that streaked towards them and just past the right hand side of theplane! The object was only in sight for 2 to 3 seconds and then was gone fromtheir field of view. Despite the apparent proximity of this object relative tothe plane, there was no sound or wake as it passed close by. It appeared soclose that the First Officer ducked instinctively! A transcript of the communication between Manchester Airport and Flight 5061contained the subsequent discussion: > B737: Manchester this is Speedbird 5061. We just had something go down the> right hand side just above us very fast.> Manchester: Well, there’s nothing seen on radar. Was it…er…an aircraft?> B737: Well, it had lights, it went down the starboard side very quick.> Manchester: And above you?> B737: …er, just slightly above us, yeah.> Manchester: Keep an eye out for something…er… I can’t see anything at all at> the moment so… er… must have… er… been very fast or gone down very quickly> after it passed you I think.> B737: OK. Well, there you go! The object itself was described as a dark silver wedge or triangular craftwith a dark stripe down the side of it. The object was not seen again and thepassenger plane landed safely just minutes later. For some time, neither pilot came forward to speak publicly about theincident. Finally, the First Officer, Mark Stuart, allowed himself to beinterviewed by the Daily Mail newspaper. The August 5th, 1996 edition carried arecap of the case along with commentary. The following are some of thestatements made by the First Officer. > “My peripheral vision was drawn to something out of the front window. I> actually saw the object coming towards me. It was a silvery-grey wedge-shaped> object.> My reaction was to reach for the control column to try to get away from what I> felt was an object in very close proximity. My hands never really went further> forward than maybe an inch or two. The object passed very, very close down the> right hand-side.> I asked the captain if he had seen it, to which he replied ‘yes’, he had.> We decided to ask air traffic control if they had seen anything on the radar.> They replied that they hadn’t and asked us if we’d like to file an air miss,> which would lead to an investigation.> The object didn’t alter its course. There was no deviation on the part of> either aircraft. It just came down the side, making no attempt to avoid us,> and we didn’t have a chance to take any evasive action. It was over very> quickly, so there wasn’t much that could be done.> I suggested to the captain that it would be a good idea to draw what we had> seen. We both did so.> The objects we drew were the same shape, but they differed in texture – mine> was a solid object which I believed had black or grey stripes down the side.> I didn’t see any windows or anything like that. The captain drew a similar> shape, but his was made up of lots of different little lights.> I felt his drawing could be explained by a reflection from our landing lights> as the object went down our right-hand side.> We then phoned air traffic control and decided that we would file an air miss,> which meant that all the traces from radar would have to be examined in> further detail.” The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) investigated the case for months, but wasat odds to determine what actually took place. They reviewed the audiotranscripts; analyzed the radar data; and interviewed both ground and airpersonnel. The result of their hard labor resulted in a final report released onFebruary 2nd, 1996 (see Appendix for the full report). The final statements ofthe report read as follows: > Having debated the various hypotheses at length the Group concluded that, in> the absence of any firm evidence which could identify or explain this object,> it was not possible to assess either the cause or the risk by any of the> normal criteria applicable to airmiss reports. The incident therefore remains> unresolved. > PART C: ASSESSMENT OF RISK AND CAUSE> Degree of Risk:Unassessable> Cause:Unassessable The case captured the attention of those in England and around the world dueto the air safety concerns it presented as well as the credibility of the aircrew. It is unfortunate that it takes a case of this nature to draw attention tothe aspect of air safety relative to the UFO phenomenon. In point of fact, anygenuine unidentified flying object that violates controlled airspace is apotential air safety hazard. This case also solidified in many people’s minds the idea that had beencirculating in England for a number of years now. It was the notion that thesetriangular UFOs being seen with such prevalence over England were in fact topsecret American/British aircraft. For years, newspaper articles in England werecontemplating this thought. Aviation experts were weighing in on the debate aswell. For most people, it was easier to accept the notion these mystery objectswere terrestrial aircraft versus someone else’s. Maybe they were right – maybenot. This sentiment was expressed in the MOD files in a letter dated January 9th,1997 in reference to the Manchester air-miss incident. It was sent to the RightHonourable Michael Portillo, MP in the House of Commons. The letter was straightand to the point: > “Dear Mr. Portillo,> As minister for defence can you explain why top secret triangular aircraft are> being allowed to fly through British airspace at a level which endangers> civilian air traffic? In January of 1995 a civilian airliner almost collided> with one of these craft and was only inches away from what would have been a> most horrific loss of life. Can you tell me if these craft are required to> observe the practise of carrying radar warning beacons? At least this would> give our civilian pilots some warning of their approach.> Yours Sincerely”> (Name not provided) [See Appendix for letter of reply] Despite concern and speculation, the sightings of these objects continuedunabated through 1995. A June 15th sighting around 2:30 a.m. was documented byRAF West Drayton involving a “triangular object – with 2 round objects brightlylit.” Another was referenced in a letter that purportedly occurred over LowBradfield Village around 12:15 a.m. on July 29th. Five witnesses there sighted a“triangular object bigger than a commercial airliner.” This object, like otherswe have reviewed, was “flying flat side forward.” A low humming sound was alsoassociated with this object. On August 14th, a roughly triangular object was sighted by three familymembers just before midnight near the Brighton Race Course in East Sussex. Thecorresponding sketch resembled the bottom of a flat iron which harkens back tothe Eklutna, Alaska case we examined from 1936 during our historical review. Thereported size of the object was enormous. This was also forwarded to the MOD byRAF West Drayton. Another sighting occurred on September 29th at 8:50 p.m. over Stanley inDurham County. The witness reported that they were familiar with most aircraftthat frequent the skies in that area, but added “but this craft seemed sounusual I just could not identify it as any known type flown in the U.K.” Headded that there had been many unusual sightings in that area recently. Thewitness noted in the report “I must add however that I did view the craftthrough binoculars as it disappeared from view so (I) had a better look than theothers at this unusual craft.” [images/00003.jpg]Witness sketch of craft, September 1995. Many more triangular reports were sent to the MOD during this timeframe. Oneaccount was titled “ ’Unidentified Flying Objects’ – Tue 12 Aug 97 – PoliceReport.” The detailed account involved the UFO sighting by two unnamed Corshampolice officers. The following excerpt tells the story: > At 0100 hours Tuesday 12th August, 1997, I was travelling along the> unclassified Corsham to Lacock road. I was in company with (name omitted). We> had reached a point just past the railway bridge, grid reference 894698, when> an unidentified object flew past us in the same direction. I would estimate> it’s [sic] height at approximately 30 feet as it was just above the tree top> level. The Police vehicle was travelling at 35-40 mph and the object’s> estimated speed is 45-50mph.> Having passed us it then headed north east towards Chippenham.

Another very brief account was documented that purportedly occurred onJanuary 11th, 1998 between 1:00 and 1:50 a.m. The location was Cuddington,Cheshire. The report described another pair of triangular UFOs. In thisinstance, the two “merged into one.” Most notable were the accompanyingsketches. [images/00043.jpg]Sketches of object seen over Cuddington, Cheshire, January 11th, 1998. These cases are but a sampling of the numerous references to large triangularUFOs in the MOD files. It should be noted that many of these reports pre-datethe famous Belgian UFO wave that started in November of 1989. Like their ProjectBlue Book counterparts, these records show that people were reporting thesemysterious objects for many years. Upon reviewing these military cases, there appear to be correlations with thenewspaper accounts previously surveyed. When viewed as a collective body ofevidence, these accounts suggest there is a consistent narrative being told.These reports strongly indicate the existence of a genuine, tangible, andoftentimes scary phenomenon. Indeed, the next step is to examine what patterns exist in the data. Itshould be self-evident by now that the similarities in these cases transcend thebasic triangular shape. When assembled, the aspects associated with the overallappearance and behavior of these objects serves to better illustrate the mysterywe seek to unravel. Chapter 7:Establishing a Profile In reviewing the multitude of triangular UFO cases on file, I have discoveredtwenty common characteristics repeatedly described by eyewitnesses which helpprovide a working profile for these UFOs. I recognize that many of these aspectsare not exclusive to triangular UFOs, but are reported in association with othertypes of UFO sightings. However, their prevalence and the consistency with whichthey show themselves in this subset of reports must be acknowledged. These characteristics can be divided into two categories, primary andsecondary, consisting of ten each. The primary characteristics are those thatare displayed in the vast majority of triangular UFO reports. The secondarycharacteristics are not as prevalent, yet have surfaced repeatedly over theyears. Together, they provide a working model of the triangular UFOs’ appearanceand behaviors. TRIANGULAR UFO CHARACTERISTICS PRIMARY• Beams of light emitted• Three bright lights (one at each point)• Large size• Ability to hover• Ability to make flat turns• Silent flight• Slow speed• Low-altitude flight• Sharp turns at high speed• Rapid acceleration SECONDARY• Associated sounds• Observed with non-triangular UFOs• Electromagnetic (EM) effects• Multiple triangular UFOs• Colored (glowing) underside• Erratic movement• Blunt-end-forward movement• Detachable lights/objects• Shape-shifting• Superstructure observed PRIMARY: 1. Beams of light emitted These fall into two categories resembling either spotlights and/or laser-likebeams. The spotlights will often shine down to the ground and illuminate terrain,vehicles, or people. There are other reports indicating the lights extend almostto the ground, but do not touch. In these later reports, witnesses havedescribed a defined beam that does not radiate outwards as a conventional lightbeam will do the further it radiates outward from the source. Reports will oftendescribe the light as appearing to almost have solidity due to this extremelyfocused beam. The laser-like beams have been reported to shine down to the ground, but alsoto “shoot” back and forth horizontally between two or more triangular UFOs. Themost common color described is that of a red laser beam. 2. Three bright lights (one at each point) Although lighting patterns vary in the reports, by far, the most commondescription by witnesses involves that of large circular white lights (one ateach point of the triangle) and often a central red/orange light located roughlyin the center of the triangle. Typically, the white lights are steady and are often reported as very largecircles of light as opposed to smaller lights as seen on common commercial andmilitary aircraft. The central red / orange light is reported as steady or as pulsing. Thislight is usually less pronounced than its white counterparts."},{"pageContent":" This is one of the most typical lighting arrays associated with theseobjects. However, it should be noted the most variability in the reportstypically involves lighting patterns. 3. Large size One of the most startling aspects of these reports involves the sheer size ofthese objects based on the accounts. Despite the fact that eyewitnesses may havedifficulty estimating size based on an estimate of altitude, the scale of theseobjects is such that they often obscure a majority of the sky when overhead. Inmany cases, a witness, despite a wide field of view, cannot visually capture thesize of these objects in their totality. 4. Ability to hover One of the most interesting flight dynamics associated with these reportsinvolves the ability for these objects to hover in a stationary position. Mostoften, these objects maintain a horizontal position parallel to the ground.However, a small percentage of reports suggest they may achieve a vertical andlateral position relative to the ground as well. While hovering, these objectsdo not exhibit any down draft or air displacement similar to helicopters oraircraft that maintain stationary positions in mid-air (e.g., Harrier jet). 5. Ability to make flat turns In conjunction with the previous aspect, an added flight characteristicassociated with these craft involves the ability to make course correctionswhile maintaining a horizontal position parallel to the ground. In doing this, they do not exhibit the characteristic roll (tilting) thatnormal aircraft display when making turns. I have suggested that perhaps thethree large lights at each corner serve as stabilizers in the same way athree-legged table would rely on support from its three legs to maintain a levelstance. 6. Silent flight Compared to any conventional aircraft, these objects are often notorious foremitting no noise whatsoever. Coupled with their appreciable size the silentflight is a characteristic that has left witnesses emotionally shaken. This absence of sound seems to be an accurate description, since manywitnesses have had relatively close observations with minimal background noiseand wind which, if it were present at the time, could suppress noise coming fromthe object in question. 7. Slow speed If these objects are not reported hovering or rapidly accelerating, theyoften are said to move very slowly across the sky. Many witnesses have madestatements that reflect this often adding a comment that they don’t know how theobject could stay aloft while moving so slowly. This is one more aspect thatsuggests some unknown type of propulsion system. 8. Low-altitude flight A characteristic that lends to the “close encounters” with these objects isthe commonly reported description of the objects being extremely low inaltitude. In the majority of cases, the altitude of these objects is oftenjudged to be approximately 500 to 1,000 feet above the witnesses’ heads. In addition, witnesses have reportedly observed these low-level flights andalso observed the objects increasing in altitude to apparently avoid collidingwith tall objects such as electrical lines and trees. This suggests dangerouslylow altitude maneuvers. Could this be a maneuver designed to avoid radar? 9. Sharp turns at high speed In association with erratic flight, these objects have been reported to makeacute angular turns and marked changes in altitude while moving at tremendousvelocities. Despite this, these objects seem to conduct themselves effortlesslyin performing these maneuvers. It cannot be emphasized enough that these flightdynamics are indicative of some non-traditional type of propulsion system. 10. Rapid acceleration In some instances, this relocation is described as almost instantaneous. Thisacceleration rate has been demonstrated while in mid-flight or from a stationaryposition. Often, this acceleration rate has been estimated to far exceed thesound barrier, yet no sonic booms are reported. SECONDARY: 11. Associated sounds As stated earlier, many reports indicate these objects are completely silent.However, this is not always the case. In some instances, witnesses have statedthat they clearly could discern subtle noises associated with these objects.Although the descriptions vary, they are similar types of noises that are notindicative of conventional jet or propeller-based aircraft. 12. Observed with non-triangular UFOs Certain cases suggest that these objects are flying in conjunction with otherUFOs that are not triangular in appearance. These accounts vary, but stronglysuggest a pattern of behavior or association that has yet to be understood.Rectangular objects have been seen in conjunction with triangular craft on morethan one occasion. 13. Electromagnetic (EM) effects In a relatively small percentage of cases, interference has occurred withelectrical devices in association with fly-bys of these triangular UFOs. Theobjects affected vary from report to report. However, due to the nature of EMeffects in association with many other types of UFO sightings, it is necessaryto mention this. 14. Multiple triangular UFOs An amazing number of reports reflect the tendency for these objects to fly ingroups of two or more. Some of the reports indicate that groups of two appear tobe common. In certain extraordinary instances, these objects seem to have theability to physically merge and separate with each other as referenced earlier. 15. Colored (glowing) underside In some cases, while discreet lights are noticeable, the bottom of theseobjects manifest a dull glow, that is sometimes reddish in color. In some cases,this characteristic has been described as a shimmering effect. Both this characteristic as well as the unusual lighting may reflect aspectsof the propulsion systems that propel these objects in our atmosphere. 16. Erratic movement One of the more enigmatic aspects associated with these objects is thebehavior of moving erratically across the sky. This can take on many forms suchas flying in zigzag patterns at high speed; flying across the sky, stopping, andflying back again and stopping, going up then down then left then right. Again,these maneuvers are executed without the typical turn radius or banking one seeswith conventional aircraft. 17. Blunt-end-forward movement A quality associated with these objects is the ability to move with a flatside of the triangle forward and a point of the triangle trailing in the rear.This is contrary to conventional aircraft design with a pointed front and narrowfuselage or a swept wing design that radiates from a pointed front. Yet, a largepercentage of reports involving these triangular UFOs have included eyewitnesseswho claim to have seen these objects moving forward with the leading edge of thecraft being wide and flat as opposed to tapered and pointed. It should also be noted the sides of these objects are reportedly flat andnot tapered in any way. References have been made to a wedge of cheese todescribe this. Again, what types of propulsion and guidance systems are beingemployed? 18. Detachable lights / objects In a smaller number of cases, lights / objects have been reported to detachor eject themselves from these craft. They have been known to apparently fly andmaneuver independently. They are also observed returning to the object in somecases. The central red / orange light (see #2) has reportedly done this in somereports. 19. Shape-shifting Objects have the ability to transform before eyewitnesses to and from atriangular shape. In many reports, the object may divide from one to twotriangular objects which then move independently. In other reports twotriangular objects may merge into one. 20. Superstructure observed Although some reports describe no structural features or details other than adark mass and lights, some accounts state that these objects have very detailedsuperstructure or relief on their undersides. In some instances, this has beendescribed as resembling pipes or girders. This would not be considered veryaerodynamic from a conventional perspective. * * * EXAMINATION OF CASES ON RECORD The following is only a partial list of cases on record that exemplify thecharacteristics previously mentioned. Please note that these cases are used toillustrate a given characteristic as italicized in each account. However, inalmost every case there is a clear indication that the sighting reports reflecta combination of the characteristics we have just described. In other words,these are not mutually exclusive. In the vast majority of cases, there are atleast two to three such characteristics described in each account. In myopinion, this underscores the fact that we are dealing with reports of similarcraft whose comparisons go far beyond their simple geometric shape. The cases listed here are in addition to those discussed previously. The onlyexceptions are select reports from the Belgian UFO wave and the January 5th,2000 incident to illustrate the similarities of these cases with the body ofevidence at-large. This is just a sampling of cases. Numerous other reportsexist in addition to what is now presented. PRIMARY 1. Beams of light emitted November 1957 – Denmark (near Jordrup). A Mr. Hans Haugaard Hansen wasdelivering some goods…and saw a triangular-shaped object moving at a verylow-level across a field. It emitted a reddish or orange-colored light and madeno sound. (source: Flying Saucer Review July-August 1958) 6-11-66 – Venezuela (Falcon State). A luminous UAO (unidentified aerial object)which stopped and hovered in midair for short intervals was seen. Severalpeople…stopped to watch the triangular-shaped object which appeared, from itsmaneuvers, to be searching for something. Its flight was fast, but the hoveringmaneuvers indicated a search of some sort. (A witness) said the object gave offa beam of light in various directions, which contributed to the impression of asearch. (source: APRO Bulletin July-August 1966) 3-5-67 – United States (South Dakota). A couple and their two kids witnessed abright light following their car. The “object” kept closing the distance betweenit and the car until there “was less than a mile difference.” The object cameclosest to the car about 10 miles east of Hayes, South Dakota and…”was as low asthe telephone wires.” The “thing” seemed to be V-shaped with a bright lightcoming from it. (Then it was) reported the road and an area around the car wasbathed in a light bright enough “so you could drive without headlights.” Thecouple also reported a humming sound and a feeling of “numbness” during the timethe road and the area around the car were lit up. (source: APRG Reporter #56,May 1967) 10-5-73 - United States (Pennsylvania). Two state troopers observed aheart-shaped object, with the point in front, shining down a large, bright,powerful beam (of light) straight down, hovering silently at about 1,200 feet.The sighting lasted 90 seconds. The object traveled a quarter mile whereupon thered lights at the side went out; it then emitted a purring sound and took off.(source: Evening Journal of Wilmington, DE) 12-9-74 – Austria. (The witness) saw an object which at first she took to be anairplane. It sent out beams – green, blue, red, and so on. She sketched atriangular shape…From 10:30 until 11:00 p.m. she watched the object. (source:Flying Saucer Review vol. 21 issue 5) 4-4-75 – United States (North Carolina). White Lake police chief reported thatan object hovered over his car about 8:45 p.m., shining a light “so bright Icould hardly look at it.” (He) said that the object hovered 200 feet over hiscar. (source: News & Observer of Raleigh, North Carolina) 8-11-91 – Scotland (Edinburgh). A triangle was reported in the skies over theBathgate Hills and it was seen to project beams of light towards the ground.(source: Flying Saucers and How To See Them, Randles) Summer 1992 – Puerto Rico (Santiago Military Base). Two brothers…saw a giganticsilent triangle passing over the town of Salinas and heading towards the base…Itlooked metallic, dark grey, with what looked like a rough under-surface withnumerous smaller lights of various colors and two big white ones. From one ofthese latter (ones) a shaft of white light was being beamed down. (source:Flying Saucer Review vol. 44 issue 3) 8-19-92 – United States (Arizona). About 1:00am a 31-year-old male was drivingnear Tucson, AZ when he noticed a strange light off in the distance. As thelight form approached from the northeast it…descended rapidly, came across afield and began to hover. A cone of light came out of the bottom whichcompletely bathed the area, illuminating the ground and surrounding vegetation.At this point the witness was approximately 200 to 300 yards from it and wasable to discern that it was a solid object, an actual craft. It looked like amanta ray with a dull black matte finish…The young man pulled his car over tothe side of the road and stopped. He heard no sound…As the craft moved directlyoverhead, the witness got back into his car and sped away. After getting back onthe freeway he spotted the craft again as it stopped over a nearby farmhouse.Again a bright light came from the underside of the craft, engulfing the entirehouse and the area around it for almost 20 seconds. It was about 15 feet abovethe house. The craft then moved away from the house, illuminating a large areaof trees behind the house. (source: MUFON Journal issue #296, 1992) January 1994 – Japan (Fujitsu-gun). At approximately 7:00 p.m. the witnessobserved a bright light moving towards his car while he was driving. The singlelight appeared to be three lights as it approached his vehicle. The lightsdescended and appeared to be attached to a dark triangular-shaped object. Thenthe car was flooded with a brilliant white light described as being just like asearchlight. The witness increased his vehicle’s speed and the object kept pacefor a short time. The beam of light lit up the road ahead of the car until thetriangle increased its speed and disappeared. (source: The Flying TriangleMystery, Omar Fowler, 1996) 12-3-94 – England (Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts). An amateur astronomer noticed abright light in the sky. He drove to a nearby hill and observed a “flyingtriangle” approach and hover over the countryside. It then shone a beam of lightto the ground. (source: The Flying Triangle Mystery, Fowler, 1996) 11-27-95 – United Arab Emirates (Dubai). Two triangle-shaped unidentified flyingobjects (UFOs) have been sighted by five men in the United Arab Emirates (UAE),the English daily Gulf News reported today. The UFOs…emitted strong laserbeam-like blue rays splashed with red (one witness) was quoted as saying.(source: Saudi Gazette, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Nov. 28, 1995) 6-26-98 – England (Stourbridge). Two individuals spotted a triangular UFOhovering above Corbett Hospital. The sighting occurred in the early morninghours. The witnesses said the UFO had white lights at each corner and projecteda white beam (of light) onto buildings. (source: Express & Star, Wolverhampton,England, July 10, 1998) 2. Three bright lights (one at each point, often with a central red/orangelight) 8-22-64 – United States (Maryland). A broadcast engineer for radio station WFBRand a friend watched a lighted triangular object pass directly overhead about9:35 p.m. At first (they) thought it was an airplane, but as it neared, heobserved it through 8x50 binoculars and saw the well-defined shape. At eachcorner was a steady bright white light. A small green light was observed abovethe white light on one of the trailing corners, and a small red light in thecenter underneath. Neither of the colored lights blinked. (source: UFOInvestigator, vol. 2, no. 12, 1964, NICAP) 10-28-80 – United States (Missouri). A number of people sighted strange brightlights flying over northern Livingston County and several adjacent counties.Based on calls to local police and radio stations, the first sightings werebelieved to have occurred between 9 and 9:30 p.m. The most widely reportedconfiguration was that of a triangular-shaped object with lights on each of thecorners and a red light hanging down from the center on some sort of appendage.(source: APRO Bulletin, vol. 29, no. 5, 1981) 11-29-89 – Belgium (Eupen). At 17:24 hours, two Eupen gendarmes…had seen in thevicinity of the Grosse Welde farm powerful lights shining on the meadows besidethe road. The vivid glow seemed to be coming from a stationary platform whichwas almost right above their van. This platform was a triangle with three bigwhite lights and a sort of flashing reddish-orange revolving light (in thecenter). (source: Flying Saucer Review, vol. 35, no. 2, 1990) 3-31-93 – England (near Kerris, Cornwall). Several witnesses on a farm watched alarge triangular object (at 1:10 a.m.) showing three bright white lights and acentral flashing red light floating along at a steady pace. (source: The FlyingTriangle Mystery, Fowler, 1996) 4-26-95 – England (Derby). A retired school teacher…was going upstairs to bed ather home at 11:45 p.m.…She peered out of the window to see a huge flyingtriangle flying slowly overhead. It had three bright white lights and onecentral red light. The witness described it as “cruising slowly and being verylarge in size.” (source: The Flying Triangle Mystery, Fowler, 1996) 1-1-96 – England (between Colchester to Clacton). A couple was traveling intheir car at 2:20 a.m. when they realized that a large triangular shaped objectwas following them. It had three very large white lights and a single red light.The object was behind them all the way from Colchester and seemed able to varyits speed to that of the car. Eventually, when they reached Clacton, it flew outto sea. (source: The Flying Triangle Mystery, Fowler, 1996) 3-9-96 – England (Gallows Corner in Romford). At approximately 10:50 p.m. fivepeople watched a large triangular-shaped object with white lights at each cornerand a pulsating orange light in the center. (source: Romford Recorder, Essex,England, Mar. 15, 1996) 6-17-96 – United States (Florida). A large black triangular object was spottedat about 10:30 p.m. by a Pensacola motorist…He pulled his vehicle to the side ofthe road as did another motorist. The object had a single white light at eachcorner and hovered directly over the road. A red blinking light was at thecenter of the triangle. (source: Islander, Pensacola Beach, Florida, July 10,1996) 3. Large size 11-3-61 - England (Eyres Monsell). At 4:30 p.m. a witness observed an objectthat was brilliant like a star with an orange center flying south at anestimated 600 miles per hour. It was reportedly triangular in shape and appearedto be about three times the size of an Avro Vulcan bomber. The Vulcan bomber hasa wingspan of 99 feet, 5 inches, and a length of 97 feet, inch. (source: FlyingSaucer Review, vol. 8, no. 2, 1962) 12-15-65 – England (Surrey). A reader noted that he observed a triangularobject, white in color, fly over his home in the direction of London (Heathrow)Airport. The man wrote, “What attracted my attention was the sound of anairliner’s engines and as I am keen about aircraft I looked up: the aircraft wasstill some way off, and it was then that this triangular UFO swooped by like agraceful swan. It was lost to sight in a second or so and it did not have anyfins, aerofoils, or apertures. The altitude of the clouds and the object wereabout 1,500 – 2,000 feet…The object was about one and a fourth times the lengthof a Vickers Viscount aircraft (85ft,8in) and the apparent wingspan width of aBoeing 707 (minimum of 130ft, 10in) as the width of its base. Also, it wasabsolutely silent.” (source: Flying Saucer Review, vol. 12, no. 2, 1966) 4-14-72 – United States (Connecticut). At least four adults around the city ofWaterbury reported spotting a triangular-shaped UFO moving silently above thetown. All of the witnesses said the object emitted no sound as it maneuveredabout the evening sky. Two witnesses claimed the object appeared to be about thesize of a 707 (minimum width of 130ft, 10in / minimum length of 144ft, 6in),while another witness said he thought it was even larger – “bigger than a 747(minimum width of 195ft, 8in / minimum length of 231ft 10in).” (source: UFOInvestigator, Dec., 1972, NICAP) 5-5-81 - United States (New Jersey). Four family members reportedly observed alarge UFO glide noiselessly over their home in Tewksbury. Following a poweroutage around 9:30 p.m., the family’s attention was drawn to lights outside thehome. One of the witnesses observed dozens of green, blue, and red lights“buzzing” in the southern sky. According to this witness, they appeared to hoveraround a huge airborne vehicle covered with hundreds of lights. “The big shipwas simply enormous” said the witness. He estimated it to be larger than four orfive Boeing 747 planes put together. “It wasn’t round. It was kind of elongatedand had an outline of wings.” Another witness remarked that the thing was flyingat the same level as a small aircraft would fly – not as high up as a jet.(source: Hunterdon County Democrat, May 14, 1981) 8-1-83 - United States (Washington). Two witnesses reported to MUFON that theyobserved a triangular-shaped object over College Place (near Walla Walla) around9:15 p.m. The witnesses were sitting on their front porch enjoying the night airwhen they sensed something passing over the house. They observed thistriangular-shaped object which one witness described as like one of those “oldflying wings.” They said it was covered in a myriad of small, off-white ororange colored lights on the underside and along the edges. No distinguishingmarks were noted. The object was silent. One witness estimated the apparent sizeof the object as that of several 8.5 by 11 inch sheets of paper held at arm’slength. He said the object was large and traveled “awful fast.” (source: MUFONJournal, #188, 1983) 4. Ability to hover 11-23-57 – United States (Richland Township, Pennsylvania). Six truck driversobserved a “strange lighted object hovering over a field…for half an hour.”Witnesses were interviewed by local police. The interviewing officer stated “Inever saw three men more shaken up.” The drivers were returning to their placeof business after eating at a local restaurant. They noticed an object hoveringover a field adjacent to the road with three lights in a triangular pattern.They stopped and exited their vehicle. They then walked across the field towardsthe object. When they got within 75 feet of the object, it moved to the eastthen to the south. Some men returned to their vehicle and aimed its headlightsat the UFO. The UFO then extinguished its lights and disappeared. (source:Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph, date unknown) August 1969 – England (Bolton, Lancashire). “Watched by a terrified woman andher 14-year-old daughter, a mysterious flying object hovered for ten secondsover the rooftops of Bolton and then disappeared in a flash of light…Mrs.Unsworth and her daughter Carol were looking out of their back bedroom window atdusk when they saw the huge, triangular object. It was surrounded by flickeringgreen lights with oval lights, one red and two green, burning at the corners. Icouldn’t judge how big it was, but it was certainly big. It was silent and itstopped over the chimneys as though it wanted someone to see it.” (source:Evening News, August 26, 1969) 9-8-70 – United States (Washington). In Zillah, a farmer dismounting from histractor at dusk spotted a triangular shaped object hovering overhead in thedirection of the moon. “Steel gray” in color, it had a red light at each of itsbottom corners and white lights or windows in its center. The object was alsoobserved by four other adults and three children. It eventually moved upward andout of sight. (source: UFO Investigator, January 1971, NICAP) 2-12-78 – United States (Washington). A couple observed an orange triangle witha hole in it hovering above Lake Sacajawea for approximately 15 seconds atapproximately 11:00pm. The triangle was about two and a half trees up in the air(altitude). According to the witnesses, there was no noise. (source: LongviewWashington News, Feb. 13, 1978) 5. Ability to make flat turns. 9-7-53 – United States (Ohio). At approximately 6:30 p.m., a Cleveland manwitnessed a UFO pass overhead. The man glanced up to notice a grayish-blueobject directly overhead that was heading north. The UFO appeared to be lessthan 3000 ft altitude. It was shaped roughly like an equilateral triangle, butrounded somewhat on the sides and angles, and was rotating around a centralaxis. Eventually, the object disappeared from sight after about 5 seconds.(source: The UFO Evidence, NICAP) 11-24-86 – United States (Wisconsin). At 11 p.m. a man was driving when henoticed unusual lights in the sky. He stopped and observed an object describedas resembling a flattened triangle. The size was estimated to be about 75 ftwide. Pairs of flashing red lights were seen at each corner. On the sides of theobject were pairs of white and red lights that did not flash. The object itselfwas a dark brown or black color. As it hovered, it rotated slowly and made nosound. The man watched the object for about 2 to 3 minutes and decided to get acloser look. As he drove toward it, the craft stopped rotating and began tomove. It stayed in front of him flying very low. The man eventually lost sightof the object behind some trees. (source: APRO Bulletin, vol.33, no. 7, 1987) 1-5-2000 – United States (Illinois). At approximately 4:15 a.m., an Illinoispolice officer responded to a call regarding a UFO heading towards the vicinityof Lebanon. He noticed a brilliant set of lights in the eastern sky and drove toinvestigate them further. Upon nearing the lights, he could see a large,elongated triangular-shaped object moving silently through the sky. He exitedhis vehicle and observed the object. It rotated in the air making a flat turn(i.e., maintaining a level position). It went from pointing northwest topointing southwest. Then the object silently and abruptly accelerated awaytowards the southwest. (source: MUFON Journal, #383, 2000, and personalinterview notes) 6. Silent flight March 1967 - Puerto Rico (Guaynabo). A group of students observed a triangularUFO (exact date unknown) above a nearby mountain. The craft was totally silentand had a cupola on its upper center. It flew around for a while beforevanishing, and was reportedly seen by other witnesses. (source: Flying SaucerReview, vol. 44, no. 3, 1999) 6-15-77 – Canada (Penticton). A man and his friend were standing outside in whenthey observed a delta-winged (triangular-shaped) object traveling from north tosouth at a high rate of speed around 11:10 p.m. They observed it for about 15seconds before it disappeared. They reported that the object made no sound as itflew over the city at an altitude of about 2,000 ft. The object had lights onall three tips. (source: Penticton Herald, June 16, 1977) February 1982 - United States (Vermont). A woman was driving home around 9 p.m.in mid February when she saw a light in the sky. As it approached, she was ableto discern it was triangular in shape. As she pulled into her driveway, she wasstartled to see the object hovering in her back yard, about 25 ft away. She wasstartled even further as it moved directly over her head, making absolutely nosound. She added that it was much bigger than she initially thought. She said itwas “maybe as big as a football field.” The object then moved away noiselessly.(source: APRO Bulletin, vol.31, no. 7, 1983) 3-28-84 – United States (New Hampshire). A triangular-shaped object reportedlypassed over a car in West Nottingham at an altitude of about 50 ft around 8 p.m.in New Hampshire. The object had two bright lights like car headlights and gaveoff no sound. (source: APRO Bulletin, vol. 32, no. 3, 1984) 7. Slow speed 3-16-78 – United States (California). Multiple witnesses observed a brightlylit, low flying UFO over South San Luis Obispo County. Two town mayors, andofficers of the local sheriff’s department were witnesses to the event. Mostwitnesses agree that the craft was slow-moving, appeared to hover and approachedquietly. One mayor commented that “It appeared to me to be less than a mile upand moving very slowly. I don’t think it was going more than 100 miles an hourand appeared to be of a triangular configuration, the way it was lighted. I’venever seen an aircraft of that size move so slowly.” (source: Times, Mar. 17,1978, Santa Maria, CA) 7-26-94 – United States (Pennsylvania). Numerous persons spotted a triangularobject over Steelton, PA at about 11 p.m. The object – traveling at an estimated15 mph – had a dark body or fuselage with lights underneath and white“headlights” in front. (source: Patriot News, July 28, 1994, Harrisburg, PA) 10-11-94 – England (near Brindley Ford). A newspaper photographer was called outto cover a local incident and was driving along the A527 when he noticed anobject in the sky around 9:30 p.m. As the object drew nearer, he was able tomake out a triangular shape between 20-30 meters wide. He saw a row of redlights along the bottom edge and other red and yellow lights were visible. Thespeed was estimated at only 30-60 mph and it was only 400-500 ft away. No soundwas heard. It was last seen “gliding” over the village of Brindley Ford.(source: The Flying Triangle Mystery, Fowler, 1996) 8. Low-altitude flight 11-19-85 – United States (Wisconsin). At 11 p.m., a woman was driving…onMilwaukee Street. She noticed a group of three lights that she first thoughtwere helicopter lights. They reportedly came within 10 ft of the road. Thinkingit was about to crash, she pulled her car over to the side of the road makingsure not to take her eyes off of them. The row of lights made a “sharp andgraceful 90 degree turn.” It was now in front of her car. She continues bysaying “Ascending straight up, several feet in front of my car, the craft avoidshitting the power lines.” As the object rose, the streetlight illuminated it. Itwas solid and triangular in appearance. No wings, propellers nor engines werevisible, and whatever it was, it moved in silence. It swept north, hovering 12to 15 ft above a house. The article states that three days later, about 5 p.m. on Nov. 22nd, a stateemployee was driving on Highway CV…when he saw three similar lights in the sky.They were hovering 20 to 30 ft above a farmhouse. It was roughly triangular witha sloping bottom, and moved silently. (source: Madison, Oct. 1992, Madison, WI) 12-31-94 – Scotland. At 9:20 p.m. on New Year’s Eve a man was enjoying a cigarin his backyard waiting for his wife to return home. Suddenly a trio of dullorange lights appeared. Once he had focused on these lights, he realized thatthey were on the points of a triangular-shaped craft that passed directlyoverhead. This craft was either black or dark gray in color and was obviouslysolid as the stars were blotted out as it went by. The only noise to be heardwas a rushing air type sound. It was in full view for around 7 to 10 seconds. Arough guess as to its altitude would be around 500 to 700 ft up. (source:Evening Express, Jan. 20, 1995, Aberdeen, Scotland) 9. Sharp turns at high speed 1965 – Sweden (Bienne). Three young men reportedly observed a triangular UFO asreported in the Swiss newspaper, Pour Tous, no. 35 of August 24, 1965. Thewitnesses described the object “as a triangle with a luminous point (of light)at each of its angles.” Although no date is given for the sighting, the articlestates that they observed this object that was tilted slightly and moving veryfast from north to south along the Jura Mountains. The height of the object wascomparable to the middle part of the mountains. They had the impression that theobject skimmed the rooftops of the houses in the Beaumont sector of the town.Suddenly, it stopped, between Bienne and Vigneule, at the same time changingcolor from yellow to dark red. In a fraction of a second after stopping, it madea 180 degree turn. “Then it took off again like lightning towards the east,which involved a 90 degree change of course, and then it vanished suddenly.(source: Flying Saucer Review, vol. 12, no. 1, 1966) 10-2-71 – United States (Michigan). A 29-year-old ex-Air Force man was drivingfrom Caro to Watrousville around 6:30 a.m. and spotted a triangular shaped UFOwith a large white light at the bottom and many smaller red lights around it.The object emitted no sound and made sharp turns at “fantastic” speed. When theobserver moved in direct line with the object it moved quickly out of sight.(source: UFO Investigator, Dec. 1971, NICAP) 3-30-90 – Belgium. Two F-16 jet aircraft were dispatched at 00:05 hours to tryto identify a UFO that had been tracked by four separate NATO radar trackingstations and observed by no less than 18 gendarmes from various locales. TheF-16s were able to lock-on with their on-board radar systems, but each time thiswas achieved, the UFO would rapidly accelerate and make radical evasivemaneuvers at these high velocities. One example of this behavior can be seen when reviewing the radar recordings.These were graciously shown to the public during a press conference moderated byColonel De Brouwer of the Belgian Air Force. It shows the UFO initially at 7,000ft and moving at 150 knots. After the radar lock-on, it climbed to 10,000 ft at570 knots and then descended to 500 ft in five seconds at 990 knots. No sonicboom was noted despite the recorded speeds being in excess of the sound barrier.(source: Flying Saucer Review, vol. 35, no. 4, 1990) 10. Rapid acceleration 1965 – Sweden (Lulea). Two witnesses observed a triangular UFO as reported inthe Swiss newspaper, Aftonbladet, dated Nov. 6, 1965. Although no date is givenfor the sighting, it reportedly occurred over the Lulea archipelego. The objectwas the shape of a triangle with very bright points (of light) and it movedbackwards and forwards in the sky for 20 minutes. Upon stopping, it thendisappeared silently at great speed in a westerly direction. (source: FlyingSaucer Review, vol. 12, no. 1, 1966) 1-20-68 – Brazil (Brazilia). Two police deputies reported that they observed atriangular-shaped UFO 15 kilometers outside of Brazilia while they were drivingin their car. The deputies stopped and exited their car to observe this object.They witnessed it hover for five minutes. The time of the incident was 6pm. Itstayed in one position for about four minutes, then accelerated suddenly andsped toward Goiania. (source: APRO Bulletin, Jan.-Feb., 1968) 5-10-77 – United States (Georgia). Two witnesses observed a UFO in the pre-dawnsky around 5:10 a.m. It seemed to be circling slowly over the area. On thebottom was a circle of foggy light surrounding a triangle of intense light. Itstopped at one point and hovered about 1,000 ft off the ground. The body wasdescribed as grayish-silver with three creamy yellow lights. The UFO hovered forabout one minute and then darted off toward Atlanta at a tremendous rate ofspeed. (source: News-Tribune, May 10, 1977) 6-10-82 – United States (New Hampshire). Three witnesses saw a wedge-shaped UFOwith bright white lights and smaller blue-green-red body lights hovering about50 feet over a reservoir in Madbury. The lights reflected off the water’ssurface. The time was 10:30 p.m. The object moved away as the witnesses tried todrive to a better viewing location. It seemed to move from one location toanother almost instantaneously. The witnesses saw it again hovering over a housewith a wobbling or oscillatory motion. A red light beam shone down on the houseand then on the car. After a while the object approached the car from behind andpassed over it about 30 feet above the ground. (source: The UFO Evidence, VolumeII, Hall) SECONDARY 11. Associated sounds 7-22-66 – England (Radnorshire). A man, his son, and a neighbor observed a UFOto the east around 9 p.m. near the town of Llandrindod Wells over PenybontCommon. It could be very clearly seen hovering for perhaps 30 to 40 seconds.“The shape of the object was that of an isosceles triangle or low cone, and itwas like highly polished silver shining brilliantly…The farmer (neighbor) saidhe heard no sound, but both my wife and I heard a low humming whilst the objectwas almost overhead.” (source: Flying Saucer Review, vol. 12, no. 6, 1966) 3-28-73 – United States (Rhode Island). At approximately 7 p.m., two girls sawan object with a rough triangular shape hovering over the trees on Stony Lane inExeter. The object glowed with brilliant white lights.

At approximately 8:30 p.m., the witnessand her three children were returning home in their car when they noticed anobject with “very bright lights” moving back and forth across the sky. Upontheir arrival, they observed the object again moving “very slowly and low” abovethe house. The adult witness stated the object was bigger than a jet plane,shaped like an arrowhead and appeared to be made of a metallic material “likechrome, but flat – without a glow.” Behind it, separately, was a red lighttraveling in tandem with the leading object. About 30 minutes later, the objectreturned and moved over their house heading in a westerly direction. The witnessstated, “This time, there was no red light behind.” (source: APRO Bulletin, vol.30, issue 1, 1982) 8-20-84 – United States (New York). At approximately 9:00 p.m., a Mahopac Fallswoman and her daughter were returning home when they noticed a triangle-shapedUFO with an unusual “L” shaped tailpiece. They stopped their car to observe thisobject more carefully. It reportedly had one red light, one green light, andeight white lights. The witnesses stated the object was moving south when itsuddenly made a 90 degree turn and slowly moved towards them. They then decidedto resume their drive home, which was just around the corner. During this shortdrive, the object stayed with them in the sky. Once at home, the woman enteredthe house to obtain binoculars. She could clearly see a dark gray/black objectthat appeared to be metal. It then moved off over a neighbor’s yard and hovered.As it hovered there, another UFO came into view. It had the same coloring as thefirst UFO. This UFO was rectangular in shape with four bright white lights ineach corner (see Belgian report of 11-29-89 below for comparison). It moved infront of the first UFO and obscured it for about five seconds. Then the secondUFO vanished from sight. The first UFO continued to hover momentarily and thenmoved off and out of sight as well. Both UFOs were completely silent.

The object had been reported by other gendarmes that sameevening. At 18:15 this object was seen to shoot up obliquely into the sky anddisappear. This was to be replaced by a second UFO that was described asrectangular. It appeared to be at a height of 100 to 150 meters and travelingvery slowly. It was estimated to be 6 to 8 meters in length with four verybright lights at each corner. The object then moved off and out of sight.(source: Flying Saucer Review, vol. 35, no. 2, 1990) [images/00058.jpg]Eupen, Belgium, 1989. 10-18-98 – England (Wombourne). At 12:40 p.m. three witnesses observed a spherein the sky which appeared to be motionless over Sandwell Valley. The sphere wasin view for about twenty minutes when a metallic-looking triangular UFO alsoappeared. The witness said the triangle moved from side to side “in shortbursts” before vanishing completely. The sphere remained in its originallocation but dwindled to a dark spot. The overall sighting lasted about thirtyminutes. (source: Express & Star, Oct. 29, 1998, Wolverhampton, England) 13. Electromagnetic (EM) effects November 1982 – United States (California). A man and his wife were camping whenthey were awakened after midnight with their bodies “responding to staticelectricity – every hair stood on end.” A huge object hovered above them. Theobject was “shaped like a manta ray” and was at least 200 feet across. It made ahumming sound and slowly passed over the couple, heading to the east.

At 10:30 p.m. a man was driving with a friendwhen they saw a dark object approaching. “The car radio started to suffer someinterference. We stopped the car and we got out. The object looked black and wassilhouetted against a less darker sky. It had three dull, red, steady lights setslightly in from the edges. It passed over at about 200 ft high, with no sound.I estimated it to be about 600 ft long. At one stage it bridged (extended) fromthe park, over the dual carriageway and over the houses. I have no idea of thedepth of it, as it passed directly overhead. The air seemed heavy or charged asit passed over. It appeared to be one solid object.” (source: Omar Fowler andPhenomenon Research Association files) 11-17-92 – Japan (Tenjin, Sagashi). At about 7:10 p.m. as the witness waswalking to her car, she noticed a strange light in the western part of the sky.It appeared to be moving towards her very slowly. As it came closer, sherealized it was made up of three lights and as the craft passed overhead she wasable to make out the shape of a triangular object. The object was very dark, butthe outline was edged by a gray line. It was difficult to judge the size of thecraft, but she estimated its altitude to be 80 ft from the ground. It was laterdiscovered that while the flying triangle passed over the area, FM radiobroadcasts were affected by strange noises.

On one sideof the road there is a series of buildings and on the other there is opencountryside with a series of electrical pylons carrying lines to the testfacility. As the man was driving along, his van’s headlights suddenly went outand, almost at the same time, he noticed a series of lights hovering over anearby field. He pulled over and peered out of the window. There was a formationof three bright white lights hovering over a nearby power line pylon. He wasable to make out the shape of a triangular object. As he watched it, it slowlybegan to move away. He turned his van around to follow the object, but it wasnow out-of-sight. Suddenly, his headlights came back on again.

He contacted friends in the area and they too observed this lightfrom a separate location. They observed the object appear to increase in size,until it appeared to be the size of a matchbox held at arm’s length. The objectmaintained its position in the sky now at an estimated 200 feet altitude. Nosound was evident. The initial witness stated “It looked like two saucers joinedat the rims by a black band. It appeared to move slowly towards us…As it didthat, it started to change shape. It took on the form of a triangle…It wasorange hued like street lamps, and although I could make out a definite shape,it had an orange glow around it. It moved away from us and then shot off at afast speed.” The other witnesses also noted this change in shape take place.(source: Flying Saucer Review, Jan-Feb 1979) 9-11-95 – England (Darenth).

(source: The Flying Triangle Mystery, Fowler, 1996) Chapter 8:Aerospace Experts In August 1989, Chris Gibson was working on an oil rig located in the NorthSea. His attention was drawn to a most unusual sight that day. He looked up tosee a dark triangular craft in the middle of an apparent mid-air refuelingoperation. It was situated immediately behind a KC-135 tanker plane and had twoF-111 bombers flying alongside it. This spectacle, though high in the sky, wasvery clear against the white clouds in the area. Gibson knew exactly what types of aircraft were escorting this triangularobject. He should know, since he was a trained member of the Royal ObserverCorps (now defunct). Gibson was trained on how to identify any known aircraft,but the triangle was a definite unknown. It wasn’t until 1992 when he saw amagazine illustration of a hypersonic aircraft design that he made a connection.It was at this point, he suspected the object seen was a new top secret aircraftcalled Aurora. Gibson’s sighting was reported in various newspapers and was also profiled inthe March 1993 issue of Popular Science. The article referred to Aurora aspossibly being an operational spy plane to replace the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbirdwhich was officially retired in February 1990. Shortly after that, the article stated that sonic booms began rattlingsouthern California. It added, “Officials at the United States GeologicalSurvey, the agency that monitors earthquake activity, no doubt irked themilitary with their public statements that a very fast, high-flying aircraft wascausing the ‘airquakes’ registering on their array of seismographs.” One particular incident involved an unidentified aircraft which traveledacross southern California at an estimated Mach 3.1 on January 30th, 1992. Ofparticular note was that this sonic boom’s signature differed to those createdby the SR-71 or NASA’s space shuttle. The recordings plotted a flight pathheading towards southern Nevada. Suggestions were made that it might have beenheading towards the mysterious Air Force test facility at Groom Lake that has asix-mile long runway. Imbedded in the Popular Science article was a separate article entitled“Flying in the Government’s Black World.” Written by aviation experts, BillSweetman and Stuart Brown, it provided an overview of secret aircraft programswhich might include Aurora. They referenced a 1992 report titled “MysteryAircraft” written by the Washington D.C.-based Federation of Scientists (FAS).The report concluded that two or more secret airplanes are possible. The reportis quoted as saying “It is probable that at least one high-altitude experimentalair vehicle is currently undergoing flight tests.” It further stated this craftmay have achieved operational status. [images/00044.jpg]Concept drawing of Aurora from Motorbooks International Mil-Tech Series, AURORA:The Pentagon’s Secret Hypersonic Spyplane, by Bill Sweetman. Going into further detail, the report added this craft could be manned orunmanned. Speculation was that this could have been a Mach-4 to Mach-6Aurora-type craft or a Mach-8 “exotic propulsion aircraft” utilizing apulse-detonation or external combustion technology. In either case, these arecombustion technologies that create sound when in operation. Despite high-speedsand purported triangular bodies, could these explain what witnesses havedescribed in recent years as “triangular UFOs”? Indeed, the triangular shapedescribed by Chris Gibson is a familiar one to us after having reviewed amultitude of cases. The high speed velocities as well are very reminiscent ofsome of these UFO reports. In contrast, the reports we reviewed thus far have involved triangularplatforms that in the majority of cases make no sound. In cases where sound isnoted, it is usually very faint. Further still, the cases we have examinedinvolve the triangular objects hovering; moving slowly; and quickly approachingto and departing from a stationary position. The sighting reports reviewed alsodo not reference any type of vertical stabilizers being evident on the objects.Finally, despite the estimated supersonic speeds and those measured on radar,the UFOs we have examined do not generate sonic booms. Is it possible we aredealing with two different groups of triangular craft operating in our skies(i.e., one that is manmade and another that is of unknown origin)? Chris Gibson’s North Sea sighting was confirmation for many who had suspectedthe United States was conducting test flights of advanced aircraft resembling atriangle. As previously reviewed, the 1988 UFO sightings in the Midlands ofEngland made some aviation and UFO researchers speculate these were caused bystealth aircraft. Due to the knowledge we now have 25 years later concerningboth the F-117A Stealth Fighter and B-2 Stealth Bomber, we can rule these out asviable explanations. Simply put, these aircraft make noise and are unable tohover. Evidence of this is apparent when we examine reports of UFO sightings overCalifornia that same year. The Fresno Bee edition dated October 28th, 1988 ranan article entitled “Unidentified object steals across valley sky.” The articledescribes sightings by residents of the San Joaquin Valley in central Californiainvolving objects and lights in the sky. Speculation was split between genuineUFOs and military test aircraft. The military explanation was bolstered by the fact that the NorthropCorporation was known to be building the Stealth Bomber in Palmdale, California.The article stated the Air Force acknowledged this aircraft would be unveiled onNovember 22nd of that year. In addition, an aspect of these sightings involvedthe sound of engines. One witness from North Fork is quoted as saying “I wasamazed – and somewhat frightened. When I realized whatever this thing was wasmoving away, it didn’t bother me. But when it was coming back, I felt it had tobe something that our government was doing. It was definitely a motor sound –nothing eerie like something from another world, although I still think that’spossible.” None of the witnesses mentioned hovering behaviors in the article. Less than one month after this article in California, the Southend EveningEcho out of Essex, England ran a story on November 18th entitled “Is this topsecret bomber the UFO you saw?” The article posed the question “Is this similarto the mysterious triangular object that dozens of people have seen over SouthEast Essex?” It included an artistic rendition of the suspected Stealth Bomberwhich was inaccurate based on what we now know of the aircraft. The graphicprovided displayed a triangular shape with straight rear end, as opposed to thecharacteristic segmented bat-wing appearance. [images/00012.jpg]Underside view of B-2 Stealth Bomber. Another British news article appeared the following year. The December 15th,1989 edition of the Staffordshire Newsletter interviewed UFO author, Tim Good.The article’s title said it all – “Staffordshire UFO’s not consistent withaircraft says author.” The article discussed the spate of UFO sightingsthroughout England. It went on to state there was a high frequency of sightingsin Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and the West Midlands area. Some ofthese we recounted in our historical review. Good was quoted as saying “In the case of the Staffordshire sightings, thedesign of the Stealth Bomber just is not similar to the reports of triangularUFOs which have been seen.” He continued by adding “Besides that, I wouldquestion the intelligence of flying a top secret aircraft over a highlypopulated area.” This was a sentiment I expressed when asked about the January5th, 2000 triangle over Illinois. You might assume this is what UFO investigators would say in reference tothese sightings. However a similar thought was shared by the late UFO skeptic,Philip J. Klass when asked about the triangular UFOs being seen over Belgium andHudson Valley. In the November 29th edition of the Tribune out of New York, NewYork, the “Science Frontiers” section written by veteran UFO investigator,Antonio Huneeus, ran a story titled “Debunker Scoffs at Belgian UFO Flap andSecret Weapon Theory.” Klass is questioned as to whether he believes the two waves of UFO sightingscould have been caused by top secret military aircraft. He replied “in myopinion the answer is absolutely not.” Klass continued “If there were [sic] asecret airplane, for goodness’ sake, the last place in the world you’d want tofly it is in Duchess [sic] County (New York), where people have been alerted tolook for objects.” This position was also echoed by Captain Jay DeFrank of the U.S. Air ForceStrategic Unit when asked about triangular-shaped UFOs over Wythe County in theState of Virginia in 1988. DeFrank was quoted in the Richmond Times-Dispatch ofApril, 28th that year stating “…common sense would tell you we wouldn’t fly a[secret] aircraft in an area where the public could see it.” I would also add that it would be counter-productive to light the top secretaircraft up like Christmas trees, as reports suggest in many cases. If they wereoperating in these populated areas, which I personally question, these aircraftwould fly with little or no lighting. There is a reason they are called“stealth” beyond just their radar evasiveness. Despite the B-2 Stealth Bomber being fairly large with a wingspan of 172 feetand length of 69 feet, this is dwarfed by accounts of triangular craft estimatedto be 200 to 300 feet per side. Further still, claims that attribute triangularUFO reports to F-117A Stealth Fighters are even more ludicrous. These planes,that in reality are not fighters but ground-attack aircraft, have a wingspanthat measures a mere 43 feet 4 inches and length of 65 feet 11 inches. Itstretches the imagination that such an aircraft would be misidentified as atriangular UFO of the size described. [images/00053.jpg]Underside view of F-117A Stealth Fighter. However, as triangular UFOs were being attributed to Stealth Bombers inVirginia in 1988, we had UFOs over the Midlands in England being attributed toStealth Fighters as discussed previously in Chapter 5. It should be noted thatat the time not much was known of this aircraft. In fact, for years it waserroneously referred to as the “F-19.” Speculation ran rampant about thisradical new aircraft. Beyond the error in its assumed name designation,imaginations ran wild with regard to its proposed shape. This ultimately led tothe development of toy models created by the Testors model company in 1986;Monogram model company in 1987; and Revell model company in 1988. Ultimately, itwas shown that none of these models bore resemblance to the actual aircraft,once the Stealth Fighter was unveiled to the public in November of 1988. Beyond the aspects of shape and design, there are the flight characteristicsor limitations of this aircraft. Namely, the F-117A does not hover and is notsilent. These aspects cannot be overemphasized despite numerous claims in thelate 1980s to the contrary. With the passage of time and the knowledge we nowpossess in relation to these aircraft, we can dismiss these explanationsoutright. The question then remains: What were these people witnessing? For better insights in this area, I felt compelled to reach out to aviationexperts to provide their insights into the history of triangular or delta-wingaircraft design and various propulsion technologies. Their expertise wouldhopefully provide better insights into the capabilities of today’s cutting-edgeaircraft designs as well as those of recent years. This knowledge would provideimportant parallels in examining these triangular UFO reports. As I had statedduring my investigation into the January 5th, 2000 Illinois case, the militaryexplanation was much more practical than these craft being of non-terrestrialorigin. During the course of corresponding with various aviation experts anddiscussing my research, I was steered in the direction of a Professor John E.Allen. Allen is a leader in his field with an impressive resume that he willallude to. At the age of 92 years old, he is a sharp, affable, and engagingindividual with a pleasant humility and self deprecating sense of humor. Professor Allen was Chief of Future Projects for British Aerospace (now BAESystems). After retirement, he served as Visiting Professor of Aerodynamics atKingston University. He was an Engineering Consultant for the BAE Systems’Project Greenglow that investigated the concept of gravitational propulsion. He has been a direct witness to the evolution of aerodynamics over the last70 years having a multi-faceted career in this field of research. His knowledgeand expertise in the field is a well-recognized fact. He is no stranger todelta-form aircraft like the Avro 707 or Avro Vulcan (a.k.a. the Hawker SiddeleyVulcan). I found him to be the perfect aviation expert to discuss the subject oftriangular UFOs given his extensive knowledge of aircraft development over thelast several decades in addition to his concepts for future propulsiontechnologies. As you will see in the subsequent interview recorded on April 14th, 2013,Professor Allen is a classic scientist who explores facts even as they appliedto his “what-if” study that explored advanced propulsion systems. He isskeptical of UFO reports given the nature of eyewitness testimony, but concedesthere may be a genuine phenomenon behind some of the reports. In fact, he willrelay details of the radar tracking of an apparent genuine UFO in the late 1950sby Jodrell Bank Observatory in England. One of many research papers he drafted was entitled: “Quest for a novelforce: a possible revolution in aerospace.” This was published in Progress inAerospace Sciences 39 (2003) 1-60 and is available online atwww.sciencedirect.com. The article’s abstract states “The primary task is todesign radically new aeronautical systems based on new physical principles.”Allen begins the interview by describing this work: ALLEN: I took the view that I wanted to design something which I did not havethe physics of it, you see, and so I did a what-if study. What would happen tothe design possibilities if I had a new kind of force and a new kind ofpropulsion. Anyway, it had a lot of numbers in it and reflected my generalattitude to all these things and was quite clearly a lot of very differentpoints of view.MARLER: Can you give me the back story on Project Greenglow? You described thatyou were approached by British Aerospace, correct?ALLEN: Yes. I was well-known to British Aerospace as I’d held several very keyjobs as chief engineer on various projects, and I was fairly well-known aroundthe industry and the various societies. And I went to give a lecture to theheadquarters branch up at Warton, which is where Dr. Ron Evans worked. (Dr.Evans was Project Leader for Greenglow).MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: And I gave them a lecture about the long-term future of aeronautics andafterwards had a lunch, and they said to me, “Would you like to do a study forus?” I said, “Yeah, I’d be happy to do anything. I like studying whatever’snew.” And so I said, “What do you want to do?” And they said, “Well, we wantedyou to review and report on the prospects for the changes in aeronautical designin military aircraft of the availability of an antigravity drive.” In otherwords, should a competitor hit this on the jackpot, what sort of improvedperformance is one to expect, you see?MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: I said, “Well, yes, that’s very exciting. What is this antigravitydrive?” So they said, “We don’t know,” which left me a little bit distraught, mylegs shot off from underneath me, you know. But I ruminated on it for a fewhours and I thought, “Well, if that’s what they’re up to, I’ll have to inventwhat somebody might have done elsewhere, but I’ve got to have all the forces andI’ve gotta have all the controlling moments of the right magnitude.”MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: At least, I can get that right because I am an expert in doing thatanyway.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: And let’s see what comes after that, you see? So I did it for militaryaircraft and I realized it was going to be fairly significant, but it was moreimpact for space flight, and I looked at that design: moon craft, space touringcraft. You know, it’s all in the article. And then I thought, “What would it dofor terrestrial transport?”MARLER: Yes. Project Greenglow began in 1997, correct?ALLEN: Something like that, yes. There’d been a previous one because I think RonEvans had got wind of a guidance system which depended on detected changes inthe in the gravity field. And this was discovered in the ‘80s. But it thenfocused on trying to get some new physics and applying it to produce forces, andthey had some experiments done in the wind tunnel with some metal models andthey put some electricity in it and the leading edges glowed in a green color.That’s where the word “Greenglow” comes from.There was a lot of parallel work going on in the United States at the time, achap called (Marc) Millis I think from NASA, and he was doing some gravitygradient work for propulsion. And so the difference was that the American onewas purely dealing with spacecraft applications.MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: But our one, the one I worked on, I changed it to deal also withaeronautical devices in the atmosphere and also, as I said, applied it toterrestrial devices as well. Yeah, we had a wider sort of field for exploration,but the Americans were purely on space flight at the time and that was theiradvanced propulsion system work.MARLER: And I think it’s important -- I’m glad you made the point -- that theUnited States was already engaged in research as well in this area, and I thinkfor most readers, keep in mind that, obviously, the average reader of this bookis not going to be familiar with the information within aerospace circles.ALLEN: No, that’s right.MARLER: And so when someone -- I think when the reader hears of antigravitypropulsion, to the average layperson, this sounds like the stuff of sciencefiction; but, to your point, there has been research -- a history of research --in this area for many, many years.ALLEN: Yes. There was quite a lot published about 1960 from the United StatesGravity Research Foundation. They used to give an award for the best paper everyyear. I have to just unscramble the definition of antigravity. Because if youhave something which opposes gravity, it doesn’t give you full control over thevehicle because how do you make it go sideways?MARLER: Exactly.ALLEN: You see? So I never thought that was particularly sensible, and I foundthat -- again, I keep going back to history, but this is very important torealize where the ideas came from and how long ago they came -- and there was aguy called Dr. Thurston in England. He was the first person who set up anaeronautical engineering course at university in 1908. And he did aninvestigation -- or he was asked by the government after the first World War --to produce a paper of possibilities in the development in aeronautics whichought to be understood by the government so they could fund what they felt wassensible. And this chap wrote this paper and he spoke about the developments ofretractable undercarriages. And he also spoke about Britain being able torecover oil from its own territory. (He was) very foresighted. He also spokeabout atomic power and he also referred to a novel means of propulsion which hecalled “autogravity”-not antigravity. And he called it autogravity and this wasdistinctly different, but he was dealing with the applications of way-out,speculative science and the relation to aeronautics.MARLER: And this was right after World War I, you said?ALLEN: Yeah, that’s right. And I’ve got his papers and it’s quite well-known.MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: So when it came to the point, I didn’t call it anti-gravity, certainly.Auto-gravity, I acknowledged this and I called mine “mass dynamic flight,” yousee.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: -- because you get hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, so I called it “massdynamics” you see. That means that doesn’t beg the question of its antigravity;it’s more general, you see. So I have called my thing -- it’s now generallyrecognized that it’s called -- the mass dynamic process, you see.MARLER: Yes, I’m looking over the paper as we speak. And it was interesting; didyou ever understand where the British Aerospace developed the idea to pursuethis? Did you have any insight into why they decided to task you with the job ofdeveloping this, or were they just really looking at any and all applicationsthat could be used from a military standpoint?ALLEN: Well, I suppose it’s because I had an incredible, varied career.I first started at Farnborough in 1941 and doing developments of research on newfighter aircraft after the Battle of Britain. I then did 600 test flights onseaplanes. And then I went on to the atom bomb. I worked on that at Farnboroughand we did trials, we dropped them from aircraft, and so on. And then I wasrecruited into the Avro Company in Manchester in Lancashire. And I was one ofthe seven people who set up a Weapons Research Division to research, design,develop, test, and get into service rocket-propelled hydrogen bomb.MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: So I did very well in these jobs, but I also had written lots of papers.I’d written papers for the Aeronautical Society, which turned into a book calledThe Next Hundred Years in Aeronautics. So I had a reputation of safe hands andsetting up teams and doing very difficult design work on these things, and itwas (in the) United Kingdom only. So it was a million times more difficultbecause you had to set up a team of people from nothing in parallel withdeveloping a missile. But, in the end, it all went through with a few troublesand we had 36 of our V-bombers equipped with hydrogen bombs propelled by rocketswhich would be air-launched from 60,000 feet and they would’ve been gone,accelerated up to Mach 3 and they were very stealthy designs and they’re verydifficult to pick up by intercepting radar. I also have a 39-page book which ismy CV (curriculum vitae).MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: So, anyway, I was well-known for not only being a proper chief engineerand looking after everything, recruiting teams of a hundred people or more, andso but I also had other things like I had published, and I’ve never beencriticized as being a crank so they had a safe bet of commissioning me to dothis and I, you know, made several thousands of pounds in about six years doingthis work for them. I joined British Aerospace in 19 -- let me think -- at Avro,1954. I retired in 1983. I did the work on Greenglow from 1997 ‘til 2003. But Ijust keep going forever. At the age of 79, I was appointed a visiting professorand the main -- well, one of the main -- jobs I did was to supervise all of lastyear’s students who in that year had to spend nine months on their ownindividual project.MARLER: Now was that at Kingston University?ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: One of my students did a project design of a spacecraft propelled byantimatter systems.MARLER: Okay. Antimatter?ALLEN: Right, antimatter is quite legitimate. There’s been a lot of work done onthat, which I happen to know is quite rational. I mean, there’s also someproblems about it, but, I mean, that’s a different ballgame.MARLER: Well, and I’m glad you laid out your résumé just for the readers so theyunderstand your background. Also, Dr. Evans, who was the project leader ofProject Greenglow, he was the one that put me in touch with you originally andstated that, in fact, your title was Chief of Future Projects for BritishAerospace.ALLEN: Yes, right. And then the latest title I had was Chief Future ProjectsEngineer for the Hawker Company that made the Hurricane.MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: But I just wanted to make one comment.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: I think I told you, from your book, about this device which I’m stillconvinced that I’m right in this - that the object described (referring to theNorth Carolina UFO wave of 1975 discussed in Chapter 4) was certainly a Harrier- an AV-8B made by McDonnell Douglas at St. Louis. The shape, well, the shape ofit, you see, it had swept-back wings. There’s an air intake, there’s a gasturbine, and there’s an exhaust switch -- exhaust, just hot air. You don’t getany flames coming out of it. So I can’t see how this could be anything elseexcept that. And I think I probably mentioned to you before that I have my ownpersonal records of seeing seven UFOs.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: But after some consideration and one thing or another, I was able toexplain each one of these very different instances by my knowledge of variousdevices, including meteorological subjects. But, to me as an engineer, if theseare alleged sightings of phenomena which create light, it was something up inthe sky which you can see. It was some light coming off, which gets to your eye.And you then have the people who are unskilled, perhaps not expecting to see it,have to try and work out what it is. So they have no knowledge whatsoever andthey do the best they can, but they would be influenced by things I’ve readabout, you know.MARLER: Uh-huh. Yes, so that’s a very valid point that you bring up, and onethat we always try to keep in mind as investigators into the subject matterbecause, to your point, not many people are skilled in recognizing aircraft,especially advanced aircraft design.ALLEN: I mean, and I saw this immediately because, I mean, I’ve worked with theHarrier. I was in the Harrier design team. I knew the work we did with theAmericans; the American collaboration on the Harrier was brilliant. So, anyway,the point is take the something like 100,000 or more observations of variouslights in the sky which people have identified as UFOs. Now the question is:It’s suggested that these are secret warplanes, which aren’t generally known.MARLER: Sure.ALLEN: But it might also be created by some intelligent beings from somewhereelse.MARLER: Sure.ALLEN: I mean, it has to be a possibility.MARLER: By the way, when did the Harrier actually go into operation?ALLEN: Well, it started in our country in 1965. But I think it was 1970 when itgot to the United States Air Force.MARLER: And just one of the comments regarding the North Carolina case, which Idid want to discuss with you because, again, you know, looking at the basicdescription, the lighting, etc., one of the comments that has been consistent,both in the North Carolina wave of 1975 that I discuss in the book, but, moreimportantly, going back to the 1930s and even the 1940s, are descriptions ofthese triangular objects. But, to your point with regard to the Harrier, one ofthe very distinct characteristics about these objects that all the witnesseswere emphatic about was the fact that there was absolutely no noise. And, that,that would be uncharacteristic of the Harrier jet, wouldn’t it?ALLEN: Well, the Harrier is quite noisy, but it depends on how far people assumeit to be away.MARLER: Well, some of the witnesses would state that it was directly overheadand it made absolutely no noise, so that, in those instances, it would be verysuspicious, wouldn’t it?ALLEN: And that’s… well, yes, you can’t turn the engine off in a Harrier.MARLER: Exactly.ALLEN: You have to have the engines on to keep up.MARLER: Exactly.ALLEN: So if it’s one of my Harriers but it doesn’t make a noise, that’s leftyou with a question.MARLER: Yes, indeed.ALLEN: I just wondered if there is tendency for some people to make exaggeratedclaims to get some publicity. I don’t know.MARLER: I think that we can’t rule that out as a possibility. Going backhistorically, like I said, I have well-documented cases going back to the 1930sand 1940s. Certainly, delta form aircraft -- delta wing aircraft - are nothingnew. Can you speak to that just a little bit?ALLEN: The 1940s, you say?MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: Well, I don’t have all the evidence in my mind at the moment. I mean, youknow, I know of it in a vague way, but there was at that time some very oddaircraft flying around. I mean, I worked on a whole series of extremely odddevices that we used to fly around to increase the time which our fighters, likethe Spitfires and Hurricanes, would have.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: But there’s a sketch (in your book) of a device which is absolutely likea sort of shoebox (i.e., rectangular).MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: Now, you see, I can’t equate that with any aircraft whatsoever, and itseems to me to -- I mean, I just can’t understand, I can’t put any rationalexplanation into something which is just the shape of a shoebox.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: A rectangular (object) - it’s got six flat sides, it’s got corners andedges, and I just can’t relate that to any logic whatsoever in the means ofproducing some force to make a thing go around in the sky.MARLER: Yes, and I’m glad you bring that up because I do have several cases fromBelgium to the United States to England describing that very object --ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: -- and, again, over a period of several decades --ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: -- and, in all cases, they’re seen in conjunction with these triangularobjects that people have reported in the sky.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: And, again, like the triangular objects, often the witnesses willdescribe complete absence of sound despite it being an estimated 200 feet awayin a rural setting where there’s no background noise.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: So, like you said, how do you rationalize that? I’m in the same boat. Idon’t know how to -- you know, what do I do with that information?ALLEN: No, that’s right.MARLER: And these are all very good points that you bring up. But to your point(and I think you acknowledged this earlier) - you don’t rule out that UFOs mayhave some type of extraterrestrial source as at least a possibility, if not aprobability.ALLEN: Yes, that’s right.MARLER: In one of the chapters I discussed the characteristics (of these UFOs).If people are reporting these things, and, as some people say, this isrelatively new to the phenomenon, I started to conduct a comprehensivehistorical analysis. My attitude was, “Well, are these new? Have these beenreported before?” And what I found was consistency in the reporting worldwide ofdescriptions that mirror what’s being reported today in UFO reports. And what Ithen found were some consistent characteristics. And, again, in the ‘40s, ‘50s,‘60s, even into the ‘70s, these triangular UFO reports were never widelypublished. It wasn’t part of the modern literature. People were still thinking,as I’m sure you can appreciate, of the classic flying saucer when people thinkof UFO.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: They weren’t thinking triangular objects. And some of thecharacteristics that I found obviously could not be attributed to aircraft. One(characteristic) we discussed was the complete absence of sound even when theseobjects are directly overhead or near overhead, you know, based on witnesstestimony. And another one was the large size. A personal friend of mine, who isretired law enforcement and retired military, he had a sighting with somefriends that I discuss in a later chapter in the book, and this is someone who Iknow -- now, obviously, I can’t speak to the accuracy of his testimony, to yourpoint; but I can speak to the veracity of his claims because I know him not tobe someone to exaggerate, to hoax, to lie.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: I can speak to his character. But he described the large size of thisobject and, to your point, many eyewitnesses in a heightened state of emotionmay not be accurate in their observations, which I think is a very importantpoint you addressed earlier.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: But, to me, his description, as well as other people’s descriptions,when they state that, “You couldn’t look at it. You had to look from the left tothe right to see the entire object,” now --ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: -- when it gets to that point, then I think they are describingsomething of appreciable size. But what was interesting; he described thismoving out over a clearing where they were in a rural area and, again, with himhaving it overhead looking left to right to see the entire object, he said therewas completely no noise whatsoever coming from this object.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: Now there are those unusual cases and, to your point, 90 percent to 95percent of UFO reports can be discounted as conventional, prosaic explanations.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: But there are some of those cases though that you really do scratch yourhead and you have to wonder.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: And, with the complete absence of sound, I mean could it be possiblethat they’re seeing something that’s manmade that might be utilizing some of thetechnologies that you were exploring with Project Greenglow? Could they belooking potentially at something that would have some type of anti-gravitationalpropulsion?Well, one of the other things I did have a question about and I was hoping youcould give me some insight into this, a number of the reports -- and, again, Ihave to concede that my book is based, you know, on eyewitness reports because,to your point, we really don’t have any physical evidence with regard to thephenomenon -- but a number of eyewitness reports describe the object moving attremendous velocities to the point where, based on some of the calculations,they appear to be moving, you know, beyond the sound barriers but, yet, there’sno sonic boom created. Is there anything within your background that would maybeshed insight into ways to alleviate or somehow mitigate breaking the soundbarrier and generating a sonic boom? Does that make any sense from anaerodynamic standpoint?ALLEN: -- if it’s going away from you, the sonic boom goes down -- if it’slifting -- if the device is lifting -- then the sonic boom goes downward.MARLER: Uh-huh.ALLEN: If it’s going away from you, you may not hear it.MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: But if it’s coming towards you and it goes right overhead, then you wouldhear it.MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: But the thing is that there’s one UFO event (that occurred). It was at aplace called Jodrell Bank.MARLER: Jodrell Bank, yes.ALLEN: And it was done by a professor and it was quite close to where I workedat Avro. And due to this, I went to see these people once and I gave them alecture on aeronautics. But they took me up to their recording room and theyshowed me a trajectory of an object they were picking up over the Atlantic whichwas being tracked by their radar. It was an enormous disc about a 100-footdiameter, you see, and it was able to be moved into any direction.MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: And they said, “This does not move like an aircraft. It’s too fast for anaircraft.”MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: “It’s too low to be a spacecraft in orbit, and we think it’s doing about5 or 6 times the speed of sound.”MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: And they couldn’t explain it. And I couldn’t explain it either. But thatwas told to me by the scientists who were working the Jodrell Bank radiotelescope.MARLER: Well, and you bring up a good point. I’ve been having conversations withDr. Paul Czysz that worked for McDonnell Douglas for many years. ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: He stated that when he was stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Basewhen he was in the Air Force prior to his employment with McDonnell Douglas thatthey tracked, similar to what you’re describing, they tracked an object withinthe atmosphere that was making acute right angle turns at high-speed velocitiesthat they could not explain. And he said they tracked it all the way up fromWright-Patterson in Ohio all the way up to the Canadian border before they lostthe tracking on the object.ALLEN: The first date when I did this event (Jodrell Bank), when I went to seethem, would be between 1954 and 1963. Yes. I think it is quite certain thatthose dates when I went up to Manchester was 1954. I left it in ’63, you see.MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: So that’s a fairly narrow time and I, if I looked at my diary, I couldactually find the date I did it. But I just heard what they said and I guess ofmy seven UFOs, this is the one which I have not been able to crack, but most ofthe others I did. But this one -- these (reports) were given to me by thescientists who were very well equipped and they’re highly qualified. Most arePh.D.s. And there’s no reason for them to just try and spoof me over somethingthat they didn’t (observe).MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: I mean it wasn’t that sort of occasion. I was treated with great respectand I went up the tower itself and everything. So I couldn’t see any reason forbeing deceptive about it, so I took it at its face value that what they said tome was a record that they had and they couldn’t understand it either.MARLER: Absolutely. And, you know, as far as science goes, I think it’s okay tosay, “We don’t know. We can’t explain it.” That doesn’t mean there’s not anexplanation. It’s just, based on the available information, we can’t explain itat this time.ALLEN: That’s correct, yes.MARLER: Actually, you reminded me of this in describing that encounter atJodrell Bank. The Belgian wave of triangular UFO reports, did you hear aboutthose reports in England from 1989 to 1991 where the Belgian Air Force actuallytracked these objects?ALLEN: Yes. The difficulty with this one is that these were professional pilots.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: And this does make it a very sort of significant thing worth studyingbecause, unless it was, I mean, so just two things. I mean, in a sense, theyshould be professionally qualified, and, therefore, they wouldn’t be trying toput it over on anybody.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: But you might give them the benefit of a doubt saying they reported onsomething they saw.MARLER: That’s one of the things that drew my attention to this particularsubset of UFO reports because I thought that wave of sightings waswell-documented. To your point, these were credible, military, educatedeyewitnesses.ALLEN: Yeah.MARLER: And, more importantly, prior to the F-16’s being sent up to identifythese UFOs, four separate ground-based NATO tracking stations were tracking theunknown target at the same time, a number of gendarmes and citizens in Belgiumwere visually reporting seeing the UFOs, and the locations of the eyewitnesseson the ground correlated with the radar target of the four NATO ground trackingstations. And it was based upon that information that they deemed it worthyenough to dispatch two F-16’s to identify the object. So just to give you somebackground on that.ALLEN: Yes, I’m not familiar with the details of this. I only know of itsexistence, so I’m not really in a position to give any comment.MARLER: Yes. I was just curious if you were familiar with it. When you mentionedthe Jodrell Bank incident, that made me think of the radar tracking of theobjects over Belgium.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: We talked about Project Greenglow. We talked about how you wereapproached with it.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: Can you describe when Project Greenglow concluded?ALLEN: Well, it, as usual, wrapped up because of funding.MARLER: Uh-huh.ALLEN: I think that Ron Evans told me that they spent £100,000 on it.MARLER: Okay.ALLEN: And I think the honest drive was to really prove to the limit ofpossibility the chance of anybody else in another country or a differentindustry might come up with a competitive system which would put us out ofbusiness.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: You know, it’s a good attitude to safeguard, isn’t it?MARLER: Yes, it is.ALLEN: And so I think that they were quite happy with the way we were running itand the enthusiasm we put into it and that we were able to attract a high levelof competent people.MARLER: Well, back to the subject of the book - these triangular objects.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: Just assuming, for the sake of argument, that at least the modern dayreports that have occurred in just the last few years, these sightings of thesetriangular objects, if accurate and true, do you think that they could possiblyemploy -- that these could be terrestrial objects that could be employing --some of the physics that you were exploring with Project Greenglow back in the‘90s?ALLEN: I don’t think so, no. I think there’s very good reasons to have adelta-shaped wing for aircraft like the Harrier and certainly the Comet.MARLER: So, in your opinion, the physics that you were exploring with ProjectGreenglow, you don’t believe that these could actually be implemented to thepoint where you have operational models?ALLEN: No. It was only a what-if study and I wasn’t actually drawing themachinery. But I think that the delta-shaped wing planform is likely to be ofgreater use in the future. But these shapes which show sort of a flat -- thetriangle edges -- have got a flat surface. The triangle has a deck.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: So this doesn’t strike me as being -- there’s no logic for thatwhatsoever.MARLER: I’m glad you bring that up, Professor Allen because I have a depictionof one of those objects on the cover of the book.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: Eyewitnesses, including the ones in Belgium, did describe that there isthickness as well as length and width to these objects. While you’re discussingthat blunt surface (sides) on these objects there is another characteristic --and this goes back to the United States Air Force Project Blue Book as well asthe recently declassified British MOD UFO files and they describe thesetriangles moving with the flat side as the leading edge and the apex of thetriangle trailing behind.ALLEN: Well, I don’t -- that doesn’t make aerodynamic sense to me at all.MARLER: Well, nor to me, and I’m glad to hear that it doesn’t make sense fromsomeone of your caliber because it certainly didn’t make sense to a laypersonlike myself.ALLEN: Coming back to this mass dynamic process of my own. Within the sphere,you have to call it an engine - because the engine does -- it does work on theatomic characteristics of matter, and it also embodies an interaction with thespace function as well. But, nevertheless, it doesn’t lead to any emanation.There’s no jet (exhaust) that comes out of it.MARLER: Uh-huh.ALLEN: But, in fact, I suppose if I wanted to engineer -- you take thisparticular shape we’re discussing now which is a thick triangle.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: Then I would put my device, my engine, in the middle of it. And it wouldhave enough power to overcome that particular device. And if the -- it’s not anatural shape to fly the Earth’s atmosphere because you have to have astreamlined leading edge and you have to have a sharp trailing edge to get alift out of it. And it doesn’t make any sense. But I don’t need -- I have mysphere inside that actually produces forces and moments. So even if the airflowover the surface is quite unhelpful, my machine could actually overcome thatbecause it has enough capability in producing the three moments. You know, youhave to have three axes -- an axis going forward, an axis going up and down, andan axis going out along the wing. These three axes, and you have to have enoughpower to produce moments around these three axes to overcome any hiccups from avery, very badly designed external shape, you see?MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: You see, that’s quite important. I’ve never thought of that before, butthat’s how I would interpret it, you see.MARLER: Well, and you bring up a good point with regard to these hypotheticaltriangular platforms. You touched on it. You mentioned the energy source, andthat’s certainly another question, isn’t it?ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: What would be the energy source to drive your auto-gravitationalpropulsion?ALLEN: Well, my paper, you see, had to make certain assumptions. So, yes, Imean, I assume I violated physics by making assumptions. But I declared what thevalues of the forces were and everything.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: And then, on that basis, one could go ahead and design all sorts ofthings (that) would be propelled with my mass dynamic system.MARLER: I want to make sure your position is made very clear.ALLEN: Yes.MARLER: Your position on UFOs is certainly you’re not a UFO advocate/proponent,but, at the same time, in your experience, like (the) Jodrell Bank (incident)you described the tracking of that unknown. You certainly don’t rule out theextraterrestrial hypothesis or some non-terrestrial source, shall we say, forsome UFO reports. I mean, you’re certainly open-minded to the subject.ALLEN: Yes, that’s right. I mean, Leonardo da Vinci made a great step forward indrawing diagrams in 1500 of a man in a boat flapping wings and flying. You know?MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: Well, I went to an exhibition in Florence of Leonardo da Vinci’s work,and one of these representations of these flying boats was shown there. And Isaid, “Wouldn’t it be fun if we could get Leonardo back here and I would say,‘You know, you were very foresighted because we do fly now’. And -- but I said,“We don’t just have one person in the boat; we have 500 people.” And he would bevery surprised and he would say, “I find this unbelievable because I can’timagine the size of the pulleys and the ropes.”MARLER: Conventional wisdom.ALLEN: Well, you see, he couldn’t see. But, you see, the reason he was fooledwas he thought and a lot of his detailed research went into understand how birdsfly. And he was using the principle of bird flight to apply it to his airplane.MARLER: Yes.ALLEN: Now his physics was wrong. But, the point was people believed, from whathe drew, that manned flight would be possible. You see the trick in theargument?MARLER: Absolutely.ALLEN: And it’s very clever because, even though he got his physics wrong, helet people think, and so many people thought, like all the pioneers (of flight).And they were carried on by the belief that they’d acquired from Leonardo daVinci even though his physics was totally wrong.MARLER: But it was the basis for further research that did develop intofruition.ALLEN: (I have) the same position as Leonardo because I’ve shown pictures of newdevices which have, as it were, UFO capabilities, but my physics is wrong. Myphysics doesn’t exist.MARLER: Yes."},{"pageContent":"ALLEN: So I am exactly like Leonardo da Vinci, but, as I’ve published it andyou’ve read it, you will be led along a path which says, “Yes, there is a way.We’ve already seen it.” And so we’re completely the lookalike of Leonardo daVinci. I did this with the greatest honesty. I have the greatest honesty. I’mnot trying to kid anybody. But, you see, if people look back on this maybe in200 years’ time, they might say, “Ah, yes, John Allen admitted (the nature of)his physics. Leonardo did not admit that his physics was wrong because hethought it was all right. Now I am ahead of him insofar as I said, “Look, I’mnot kidding you people. I haven’t got my physics right.” If people develop ideasthat will get me new physics like this, then I’ve won. So there you are.MARLER: Well, that’s great. And just with regard to your analogy regardingLeonardo da Vinci, I think that your analogy speaks to your humility and yourcharacter, so I thank you for that. I think that really portrays where we’re atwith this whole UFO mystery in general; we can’t definitively say these thingsare this, but, at the same time, we can’t say that we have all the answers tothe universe either.ALLEN: That’s correct, yes. Indeed. There was a very, very good televisionprogram on our national channel on Friday night about Sir Isaac Newton. In oneof my other foresighted books, I said that, “Sir Isaac Newton invented gravityand engineers made space flight.”MARLER: Yes, that’s true.ALLEN: I said that, “When we’ve fully understood our space flight better than wedo now,” I then said, “Who will be the new Newton that takes us on as big a stepfrom where we are as Newton gave us before we got here?” And I had a slidecalled, “The New Newton.” So that fits in even though I’d forgotten about it forthe last 20 years.This might give a totally different approach to the whole thing is thecombination of your writing the book and asking me to join you. It may give usan incredible, unexpected opportunity here. Well, I’m very grateful to you andmay I wish you every success through your efforts?MARLER: Thank you very much, Professor Allen.ALLEN: Thank you. Good show. I am indebted to Professor Allen for his time and keen insights. He is a truegentleman you feel gratified to have encountered given his good nature andincredible knowledge base. He was most generous with his time over the course ofseveral phone calls to the U.K. and he educated me on many related subjects fromhis years in aerospace. Interestingly enough, counterparts in the United States followed a pathsimilar to that of British Aerospace, as referenced by Professor Allen. AtNASA’s Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program, they explored similar lines ofinquiry. Namely, it was established “to seek the ultimate breakthroughs in spacetransportation: propulsion that requires no propellant mass, propulsion thatattains the maximum transit speeds physically possible, and breakthrough methodsof energy production to power such devices” according to Marc Millis, formerproject leader, in a 1999 article entitled “NASA’s Breakthrough PropulsionPhysics Program” (In Acta Astronautica, Vol. 44, Nos. 2-4, pp. 175-182.). This program ran from 1996 through 2002. Millis stated “Topics of interestinclude experiments and theories regarding the coupling of gravity andelectromagnetism, vacuum fluctuation energy, warp drives and wormholes, andsuperluminal quantum effects. Because these propulsion goals are presumably farfrom fruition, a special emphasis is to identify affordable, near-term, andcredible research that could make measurable progress toward these propulsiongoals.” In referencing the effort toward eliminating propellant mass, Millisacknowledges the fact that “Although it is presently unknown if suchpropellantless propulsion can be achieved, several theories have emerged thatprovide additional research paths. It should be noted that all of these theoriesare too new to have either been confirmed or discounted, but their potentialutility warrants consideration.” This is an important statement as it relates to our subject matter (i.e.,triangular UFOs). Based on all available information, these objects appear tofly or operate in our airspace without producing exhaust trails or noise. Thisforces us to consider the possibility these objects do not utilizepropellant-based technologies (i.e., combustion-based). Consider this thought inthe context of the statements made by Millis in 1999. If a leader in theaerospace field states that forays into propellantless propulsion “are too newto have either been confirmed or discounted” then how can we realisticallyexpect that objects observed prior to this year could be man-made craftutilizing these very same principles to apparent perfection? Again, thehistorical framework has previously been established to show these objectsclearly date back much further than the 1990s. Other areas of focus for Millis and his team involved the exploration of “howto attain the ultimate achievable transit speeds” and “discover fundamentallynew modes of onboard energy generation.” Millis and his team focused on spacetravel, but the basic principles of achieving rapid flight and increasedacceleration whether in space or within our atmosphere is an important one.Again, the speeds observed and also tracked by radar of triangular UFOsachieving incredible accelerations is noteworthy. Then we have the necessary component of energy that Millis and his teamexplored. This was a subject that was discussed with Professor Allen as well.Aerospace concepts may exist within a theoretical framework for new propulsiontechnologies, but if one does not have the necessary energy requirementson-board to drive these systems, they are nothing more than that – theoretical. In a subsequent article entitled “Breakthrough Propulsion Physics” datedNovember 19th, 2008, Millis further stated “This research falls within the realmof physics instead of technology, with the distinction being that physics isabout uncovering the laws of nature while technology is about applying thatphysics to build useful devices.” In this same article, Millis stated “All NASA support to sustain cognizanceon these possibilities has been withdrawn as of October 1, 2008.” He added “Whenfunding for active research was available, which ran from 1996 to 2002, theproject oversaw research into 8 different approaches, produced 16 peer-reviewedjournal articles…all for a total investment of less than $1.6M.” In the finalsection of his article entitled “Status of Research” he bluntly stated “Nobreakthroughs appear imminent.” Again, it is a tragedy to see funding withheld from prominent scientists whohave incredible scientific knowledge and foresight like Millis, Allen, andEvans. These men are modern-day geniuses who, if provided with unlimitedfunding, could achieve nothing short of miracles within the scientific realm. However, this state of affairs brings us back to our elusive triangles. Ifkey scientists on both sides of the pond in the U.S. and the U.K., workingwithin BAE Systems and NASA respectively, have not made breakthroughs that wouldlead to the development of triangular aircraft of incredible design andoperation – what are we dealing with? Having the insights of these experts provides us with a rare glimpse into theworld of the aerospace industry. Obviously, within this field there are thosewho take the subject of UFOs quite seriously. In fact, one highly-placedindividual within the field stated to me in an email “We are all striving forthe same purpose: to understand how UFOs fly.” Engineers are not usually in thehabit of chasing phantoms or fairy tales. This statement, coupled with theprevious information, brings UFOs clearly into the realm of fact - not fiction. So where does that leave the future of aviation? In the January 2009 issue ofPopular Science, an article entitled “Stealth Reborn” discussed the possiblefuture of stealth technology and its applications. The article focused on theconcept of a “mid-range stealth aircraft” which they stated was scheduled toappear on the scene in the year 2018. The prototype design, if accurate, resembles the modern day stealth bomberwith its characteristic bat-wing design and roughly triangular appearance. Thereis speculation as to whether this would be a manned or unmanned aircraft. It wassuggested this newer version would have a much smaller radar signature than itsmodern day counterpart due to changes in surface design and coating. One otherfactor discussed was the ability to fly up to 2,000 miles without needing torefuel via an airborne tanker. This last tidbit of information regarding mid-air refueling coupled with theoverall design shown in the article showing inlet and exhaust ports for the jetengines strongly argues against the notion that we are currently flyinganti-gravity aircraft today. If that were the case, then why are we stilltinkering with jet propelled aircraft? Before you answer that question, we can look at an even more recent articlefrom the Washington Post dated August 15th, 2012. The article entitled“Hypersonic craft X-51A fails latest test” describes the Waverider aircraft thatwas tested by the Air Force. It was launched from a B-52 bomber and lost controlseconds after the test flight began due to a problem with a control fin. Thearticle stated this aircraft was powered by a Pratt Whitney Rocketdyne SJY61scramjet combustion engine. The accompanying graphic also showed a craftpropelled by jet exhaust – not anti-gravity engines. Based on documented facts, we must concede that leading researchers have andwill most probably continue to experiment with anti-gravity propulsion. However,also based on documented facts, we must set aside any notion that we haveperfected such a craft and have been flying these around the globe for noobvious reason. All of this is in the realm of science fiction by today’s standards, but whoknows about tomorrow? Certainly, if we reject the modern day accounts as beingattributed to human technology then what does that say about reports of silent,triangular aircraft being sighted in the 1940s and 1950s if not earlier? Examples of the minutia circulating on the internet regarding these objectsare stories of the mythological “TR-3B” aircraft. Not only do websites referencethe existence of this purported United States aircraft as a solid fact, but theyalso know exactly how the craft operates. Some websites provide detailedschematics of this “top secret” aircraft and propulsion system. So much forsecrecy! Attached to these reports are individuals who claim to have worked onthese projects first-hand. However, they never seem to have the evidence to backup their stories. I have attempted to provide educated insights into this mystery by leadingaerospace experts who are well-established in their field, includingwell-documented material in the public domain. For those that still spin storiesof “black projects” involving man-made triangular UFOs, I can only point out twothings. First, these lone individuals who claim to have worked on black projects mustoffer some type of evidence beyond just their solely unsubstantiated statements.Second, if they are divulging “top secret” technological information, then whyhave they not been arrested for violation of secrecy oaths? Based on all available information, the evidence suggests the triangular UFOswe have discussed are separate from any Earth-based technologies. Despite someaerospace experts possibly studying the proposed flight characteristics of theseUFOs and hypothesized physics involved, we can conclude that “we” are not“there” yet. Again, perhaps one day we will be. Meanwhile, we are stillpresented with a genuine phenomenon that needs to be addressed. Chapter 9:History Repeats Itself The topic of UFOs is a fascinating one to be sure. Regardless of yourviewpoint on the subject, it certainly fuels the imagination. My interest beganas a general curiosity at first. Later, it developed into a focused attempt totry and gain a true understanding of the reality or non-reality of what wasconfronting us. I began to appreciate the subject beyond just the search foranswers and gained an overall appreciation for the phenomenon as a culturalaspect of our society. In many lectures I have given on the subject, I have stated that regardlessof your position regarding the UFO subject, one thing is certain – UFOs are partof our culture. You may relegate UFOs to the category of fact, fiction, orfolklore. Each person arrives at that decision individually, but nonethelessUFOs are part of our culture – love them or hate them. If they are part of ourculture, then it goes without saying they are part of our history. If there isone other passion I have aside from UFOs it is an interest and appreciation forhistory and its preservation. Like other aspects of our cultural heritage, UFO history should be preservedas well. One day, people will look back on the 20th and early 21st centuries andour fascination with “flying saucers” and “UFOs” with fond nostalgia. They maycomment on the cultural antecedents that lead to the formation of these thoughtsand beliefs involving so-called “flying saucers” or “UFOs.” They may marvel atthe phenomenon and how it evolved over decades of thought and story-telling as apervasive myth. Already, books have been dedicated to this thesis. Conversely, as more information comes to light, the stark reality that we arenot alone may become the predominant mindset. Over the years, numerous scholarsand scientists from around the world have secretly engaged in UFO research ontheir own time and on their own dime. In the last ten to twenty years, morescientists and academicians are stepping out of the shadows to acknowledge theirinterest and investigation into the subject matter regardless of ridicule. As this continues to occur, more people are having their own first-hand UFOexperiences and are opening their minds to the potential reality of UFOs.Combined, this may eventually lead to a major cultural shift in our thinking andapproach towards the UFO subject. Then again, incontrovertible proof may one daysurface that proves the existence of UFOs as a reality – whatever that realitymight be. In either case, people will look back on what occurred years and decadesearlier. They will ask questions and seek information to bolster theirpositions. If we do not take the time to preserve the UFO information we havetoday, it will not be around tomorrow. Instances have occurred where a prominentUFO researcher passed away only to have the survivors discard all of theirmaterial, since they didn’t hold an appreciation for the subject similar totheir departed loved one. At the time this book is being written, the last surviving “saucerenthusiasts” are slowly passing away due to old age. The individuals who werecaptivated by the first well-publicized “flying saucer” reports from 1947 arenow in their seventies, eighties, or nineties. I know this, since I have beenworking with a number of them to preserve their collections. This is, in part,how I have been able to amass the collection of UFO material I have today fromwhich this book is derived. One of the larger collections I have been fortunate enough to have beenentrusted, is that of The UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis. Thisorganization was founded in the late 1960s by a number of serious UFOenthusiasts. The group served as a precursor to The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON)which is now the largest investigative body in the United States. Futurefounding members of MUFON were regular attendees at the local St. Louis areameetings. In addition to hosting lectures and guest speakers from around the countryand promoting general UFO education, they also served as an active investigativegroup in the late 1960s and 1970s. Their files included UFO sighting reportsfrom the greater St. Louis, Missouri area as well as neighboring southernIllinois. These were later placed in storage along with many books, journals,newspapers, etc. The surviving members of this organization were not getting anyyounger and they were concerned about the future of their library. In the summer of 2005, I was approached and asked if I would be willing totake possession of the Study Group’s UFO library including case files. I wasapproached due to my well-known desire to preserve UFO information for futuregenerations as well as my historical UFO research and lectures that incorporatedthis same material. In addition, I was one of the youngest associates of theorganization. I was happy to accept this material and include it in myever-growing research library. Little did I realize that this decision in 2005would provide an investigative lead in my triangular UFO research six yearslater. Having sorted through most of the randomly boxed UFO material over thesubsequent few years, I found myself confronted with two file cabinet drawers ofmiscellaneous papers. These were the last items of the library that had not beenfiled. I would leave these drawers alone for another few years as I wasconstantly acquiring additional material from other sources and lecturing inaddition to my day job. In 2011, I decided finally to tackle these last two drawers of material. As Iquickly sorted the various papers, I threw away most due to them beingphotocopies of original items I already had or due to the pages having fadedwith age and improper storage. However, as I quickly tore through thisnever-ending pile of papers, I stumbled upon a few items that were noteworthy.One was a UFO sighting report from 1968. What first caught my attention was the obvious fact this was a UFO sightingreport form. However, my attention was then drawn to the sketch of the UFO aspurportedly seen by the witness. It was a triangular object. More importantlywas the location of the UFO sighting as noted on the form. It was sighted justoutside Scott Air Force Base in southern Illinois. Add to this the date of thepurported sighting: December 19th, 1967. [images/00002.jpg] I was in utter disbelief! While haphazardly sorting through old UFO papers, Istumble across a UFO sighting report that bears striking similarities to theJanuary 5th, 2000 UFO incident not only involving the same location but also thesame UFO described. Yet this event occurred roughly thirty-two years prior! Whatwas going on here? I decided to make an attempt to track down the witness to this case, assuminghe was still alive and willing to talk to me. After three decades, I was notoverly optimistic. Yet, I did have the name of the eyewitness listed on thesecond page of the UFO report form. After some time, I did locate an emailaddress of someone residing in Illinois who had the same name. After sending anemail to the individual asking if they had reported a UFO in 1968, I received areply to my surprise. The gentleman stated he did, in fact, sight a UFO in 1967,but had forgotten about filing a report after all these years. A series ofemails then led to a phone conversation. This conversation then led to aface-to-face interview in January of 2012. Due to my close affiliation with fellow-researcher, Darryl Barker, and ourshared interest in the January 5th, 2000 incident, I invited him to join me forthe interview. Upon meeting the witness and his family, both of us wereimpressed by him. Despite having witnessed this object in 1967, he admitted heis “not into UFOs.” However, he did hear about the 2000 sighting near Scott AirForce Base, since he still lives in the general area. As previously-mentioned, the witness had no recollection of filing an actualUFO report back in 1968. As a result, I kept the report from him until I couldconduct the interview to see how well his testimony remained consistent. ToDarryl’s and my amazement, his testimony was completely consistent with hisinitial report (see Appendix for report). Even with the passage of years, hismemory of the event was solid. In addition, he was extremely articulate andprecise in relating details of the event. The witness was also generous enough to allow audio and video recording ofhis interview, which I greatly appreciated. What follows is a portion of ourinterview regarding his 1967 UFO sighting near Scott Air Force Base: Witness: It was after dark. It was late in the evening. I’m not sure now thetime. We were westbound on Highway 177 from Mascoutah to Belleville. We wereright at the East edge of Belleville on (Highway) 177. There’s a tavern rightthere I believe called Lone Oak Tavern something like that on (Highway) 177. Wehad (been driving) right in that area when one of us noticed the object in thesky. And we proceeded to follow the thing across the East edge of Belleville.Marler: Once you decided to pursue the object or go after it, what direction didthat lead you?Witness: Northeast. Probably more East. East-Northeast say. It was on a fairlystraight (flight) path. We zigzagged through the city streets on the East end ofBelleville to keep up with it. It was in our line of sight all the time. Wecould see it the whole time we were following (it). And it seemed to be headingtoward Scott (Air Force Base) and then we lost sight of it somewhere aroundHighway 161 near where Southwest Illinois College is today.Marler: In losing sight of it, did the object simply depart or did you havesomething that obstructed your view at that point do you recall?Witness: Just lost sight of it. It didn’t appear to rush off it didn’t appear tochange direction drastically or anything. Just lost sight (of it).Marler: Could you describe the object when you noticed it and then did it changeappearance in any way shape or form as you were obviously viewing it fromdifferent vantage points?Witness: Yes. (It) always seemed to be in the shape of a slice of pie to me.Just that those dimensions. (It) had some thickness to it and an obvioustriangular shape.Marler: And you mentioned that there were some lights or windows as youdescribed them?Witness: There was a row of lights along one side. There was only one sidevisible at a time anyway. The row of lights were square. The lights were squareor rectangular anyway. We weren’t like watching it for any period of timebecause it was moving all the time. We were kind of hampered because we didn’thave a straight line way to follow it. We had to zig-zag. (We) never really gota chance to just sit there and look at it.Marler: Obviously you described it visually. What type of noise did you hear?Witness: Absolutely silent. There wasn’t a sound. There was no sound at all.Marler: Can you describe the general terrain back at that time?Witness: I would say it was just all open fields. Between where we saw theobject and where the Southwest Illinois College is now, (it was) pretty muchwide open at that time. Just nothing but fields. We were able to stay almostunderneath it the whole time. (We were) real close to it even though we werelimited by the speed we could drive, by stop signs, stoplights, whatever to stayup with it. We had no trouble. It wasn’t moving very fast. The terrain then wasjust open country(side).Marler: What do you think was an estimate of the closest that you were to theobject?Witness: I would say 500 feet (distance). It could have been more than that. Itsurely wasn’t much less than that. But it could have been more than that.Marler: At this time, I believe your report indicates 10:30 p.m. (CST) was thetime of the sighting and this was in December, so at any time did you have thewindows to the car rolled down do you recall to see if you could hear anything?Witness: Oh yes. Absolutely. We did do that when I first noticed that I couldn’thear anything in the car. We rolled the windows down to see if we could hear(anything). And there was still no sound. It was just deathly quiet.Marler: Now the other question I had for you is you state it was roughly, againyour estimate, within about 500 feet (distance) of where you were (positioned).Witness: Yes.Marler: What would you estimate was the altitude of the object?Witness: Close to that I would say. Because we stayed so close to it all thetime.Marler: So roughly 500 feet distance from you and 500 feet above as far asaltitude?Witness: Probably so. 500 feet away was maybe not the maximum distance it wasaway at any one time, often closer than that, until we just lost sight of it.Marler: So, just to recap, the direction you saw it coming from would have been?Witness: From the southwest going to the northeast basically.Marler: Okay. And you stated you went to Scott Air Force Base?Witness: Yes.Marler: Can you describe what took place after you lost sight of the object?Witness: Sure. Because of the direction the thing was going and also thedirection we were driving at the time was toward Scott (Air Force Base), mythought was that it was something that was going to Scott (Air Force Base). Itwas going there to land or something like that. It was affiliated (with ScottAir Force Base). I knew my way around Scott (Air Force Base). I spent a lot of time out therewith friends at the Teen Club. You know, visiting friends. And I knew where theflight line was. I knew where the control tower was. So we went to where thecontrol tower was…and we parked.., and we went up the stairs… to where thecontrol tower was and went in the control tower. Just opened the door and wentin. And there were a few fellas sitting in there and I said we have just beenchasing a thing…something flying from Belleville towards Scott (Air Force Base)(and we were) wondering if you guys had anything on radar if you had spottedanything also? They said “No.” They asked, “Where did you see it?” We told themthe direction it was flying and they talked amongst themselves and they said“No. We have nothing.”Marler: Now, moving forward (in time) to January 5th, 2000, you and your wifehad heard about that sighting.Witness: Yes.Marler: What was your initial reaction when you heard about that (case)? Did youmake the connection with your sighting?Witness: Absolutely! I said, “Holy smokes! These guys have seen the same thingthat I saw essentially!” I remember more about the stuff that I saw more thanwhat I remember about the thing that we saw on TV and the reports. But it sureseemed like there were a lot of similarities to me. An awful lot!Marler: And the size of your object again, if you were to estimate? How largedid you believe the object was?Witness: I would say 50 (to) 75 feet long. Something like that. From the pointof the triangle to say the middle of the back of the thing.Marler: And you indicated the “windows” were illuminated?Witness: Yes.Marler: Was there a color associated with that light or could you describe thelight?Witness: I really couldn’t do that any justice. It was pale. They didn’t seem tobe (aircraft) marking lights or something like that. They seemed to be windows.They seemed to be not so much illuminated at the window as behind the window.That the light was coming through the window instead of right at the window.Marler: Were there any other lights any type of navigational-type lights or whatwould look like navigational lights or were there just the “windows” that youcould notice?Witness: I don’t really recall. I don’t think so. I don’t know.Marler: Yeah. On your original report, just as a refresher, you didn’t indicatethat there were any lights. It seemed to be the “windows” were the only thing(visible on the object). So that would be consistent with your initial reportback in 1968. One last question is: Total duration of your sighting? Again, you hadobserved it from multiple points during this time period. From the moment youinitially saw the object to the moment it disappeared, what do you think was anestimate of total duration of the sighting?Witness: Twenty minutes give or take five minutes.Marler: So this was not a fleeting event? That you saw it and then it was gone.Witness: Not at all!Marler: This was occurring over several minutes.Witness: Oh yes.Marler: Hypothetically, if there was a skeptic sitting here right now and theysaid, “You just simply misidentified a conventional military aircraft.” Whatwould be your response to someone making that statement?Witness: Well, except for a few things, I would say “Sure. You know. Could be.But I’d sure like to see what you’re talking about that is of that shape and issilent.” That was the kicker for me! No noise!Marler: And again, you reiterate what you reported back in 1968. Because if younotice on the report form there you said “No sound” in response to the question,“Was there any noise?” And you underlined it twice.Witness: None. Not a hum. Yeah, no noise!Marler: So, in the literal sense of the term, you saw an unidentified flyingobject?Witness: Absolutely! And still to this day is unidentified as far as I’mconcerned. As discussed in our historical review, the general area around Scott AirForce Base has had its share of triangular UFO reports. We have reviewed thefollowing cases so far: December 19th, 1967, November 16th, 1970, January 1972,and January 5th, 2000. These are just the reports we have heard about. There maybe others. In the course of research for this book, I also came across two UFO reportsseparated by ten years near the city of Alton, Illinois located 40 milesnorthwest of Scott Air Force Base. Both reports were documented in the AltonTelegraph newspaper. The first sighting was reported in the October 22, 1973 issue of thenewspaper and was referenced earlier in Chapter 4. It described the sightingreported to Alton police by an eyewitness of a “triangular-shaped form.” Theobject reportedly had one bright white light at each point and was seen hoveringover a local road. The sighting occurred shortly before 8:00 p.m. on October20th. The witness said there was a second set of lights in a triangular patternabove the first. The lighting configuration and the fact there were two objectsfits into our established profile. Ten years later, another triangular UFO sighting occurred near Alton,Illinois. This was reported in the February 8th, 1983 edition of the newspaper.This article referenced the Illinois State Police who had recently received twoseparate UFO reports on February 7th. The first witness was from Coffeen,Illinois located 54 miles northeast of Alton. The witness reported seeing a“triangular object with bright lights” around 8:19 p.m. The second witness was apolice officer from Brighton, Illinois located 50 miles west of Coffeen. Hereportedly observed the same object approximately ten miles southwest ofBrighton around 8:27 p.m. Less than sixty miles to the northwest of Brighton across the MississippiRiver in the State of Missouri is the town of Elsberry, Missouri. It was therein 1978 that a wave of UFO sightings and cattle mutilations occurred asreferenced in the book’s introduction. However, in November of 2000, just tenmonths after the January 5th, 2000 UFO incident, a retired law enforcementofficer and former Marine along with six friends sighted a gigantic triangularUFO over a rural wooded area in the vicinity of Elsberry. The men were there to hunt deer as they often had in the past on manyoccasions. However, on this particular weekend, they sighted somethingextraordinary. At approximately 7:00 p.m., the men had gathered outside to cookdinner over an open fire. At some point, one of the men shouted “Look at that!What is that?” Another man replied “Yeah! Look at that! Look at that!” All ofthe men then focused on the sky above them. According to the retired law enforcement officer, they observed a huge flying“wedge” or “wing.” There was a white light on the left and right points of theobject. He added that the sky was “so clear and there were so many stars(visible) in the sky that night, that we could see the object quite easilybecause it was blocking out the stars in the sky of course as it was going over(head).” He added the object seemed to be only around 3,000 feet in altitude. Inaddition, he noted the complete absence of sound. He estimates they saw theobject for thirty seconds before losing sight of it, since they were in a woodedarea and only observed it while it was passing over the open field or clearingwhere they were set up. The size encompassed the whole clearing. He veryadamantly stated “You couldn’t look at it. You had to look from left to right tosee it all.” The object departed to the southeast. The witness sketch isprovided. Note the similarity in shape to that of Officer Stevens’ sketch fromJanuary 5th, 2000. [images/00056.jpg]Witness sketch of object near Elsberry, Missouri, November 2000. The witness stated he was an aviation electrician in the Marine Corpsattached to an air wing and the owner of the property, who was a witness, workedfor a major aircraft corporation based in St. Louis, Missouri. He emphasized tome that “We’re both fairly familiar with aircraft.” But he added “This is justsomething we have never seen before and it was totally silent.” Knowing this manpersonally, I would take whatever he said at face value. I know him to be ano-nonsense individual of outstanding character. This case brings to mind the argument posed by many regarding UFOs: “Why areUFOs always seen in rural settings and not over large cities for all to see?”Well, the question itself speaks to the lack of knowledge the inquisitor hasregarding the subject matter. Many UFOs have been observed over large cities andpopulation centers. Triangular UFOs are no exception. One case in particular stands out from the rest. This case actually involvedtwo separate nights of sightings over the same area involving a tremendouslylarge object as witnessed by hundreds, if not thousands of people. While servingas Illinois State Director for MUFON, I received some of the initial phone callsconcerning this incident and was involved on the periphery of the investigation.This was partly due to me residing in southern Illinois and the UFO being seenin upstate Illinois over the city of Tinley Park and surrounding areas which isroughly 25 miles southwest of downtown Chicago. The other reason for not beingdirectly involved in the investigation was that my Assistant State Director atthe time, Sam Maranto, lived in the immediate area and was well-suited toinvestigate the case. What follows is a review of the events over Tinley Park, Illinois on theevenings of August, 21st, 2004 and October 31st, 2004 and the subsequentinvestigation as told by my friend and current Illinois MUFON State Director,Sam Maranto. “I got it …I got it on tape” may very well sum up the significance of the TinleyPark, Illinois mass sightings of 2004 that occurred to the southwest of Chicago,Illinois. T.J., an avid sky watcher, chemical plant manager, father of two andauthor of this statement, was one of a number of witnesses who not only recordedthe August 21st, 2004 event, but was fortunate enough to witness and record thesubsequent events of October 31st of that same year.In both instances, the lights were observed over the surrounding areas ofFrankfort, Mokena, New Lenox, Oak Forest, Orland Park, Orland Hills, as well asMatteson in addition to other outlying regions. The lights movedThis element was an added value to the credible mass UFO sighting case thatincluded multiple video footages taken from a variety of vantage points whichoffered a different perspective of the same subject and event. Many of thesewere able to be sequenced revealing, how truly invaluable they were as itprovided supportive evidence to the eyewitness reports. To date, some twentyplus videos had been submitted for evaluation. There were three independentgroups as well as a number of individuals that analyzed these videos. Someanalyses were more extensive than others.Having personally reviewed the majority of these videos in addition to video andphotographic experts’ analyses, I can say with a comfortable degree of certaintyand in agreement with the majority who also evaluated this evidence that:1.) The three red illuminations that had been seen on both nights were mostlikely not independent of each other (i.e., they were physically connected).2.) If the illuminations were positioned / located near points of the furthestmost extremities, near what would be the vertices, then the object wouldresemble a massive isosceles triangle. Two equal length legs (sides) longer thanthe third base (leg) with two base/leg angular measurement being greater than 45degrees each.3.) The illuminations are not consistent with any known atmospheric phenomena.They are inconsistent with aviation lights or military incendiaries (i.e.,flares).4.) The illuminations themselves had properties that lacked the scintillationassociated with flares, Chinese lanterns, or any of the usual suspects. Nocharacteristics such as smoke; flickering; dropping of slag; or gradual descentindicative of the above were noted. No recovery of evidence to that effectexists either.5.) These three illuminations were reported and recorded in this area for nearlytwo hours. They reportedly disappeared and reappeared at times in varyinglocales within the overall sighting area.6.) Within a 72 hour window before and after the August 21st, 2004 Tinley Parkevent, we noted a large number of similar sightings in various worldwidelocations. Most significant was a video from Melbourne, Australia showing two ofthese identical triangular configurations.7.) These illuminations maintained altitude uniformly and hovered motionless attimes and in the presence of a breeze on August 21st, 2004 and a more prevalentbreeze on October 31st, 2004.8.) These illuminations may very well be a residual effect on the surroundingatmosphere by energized fields that may have been emitted. This may relate topossible propulsion technology as opposed to mere navigational lighting.9.) Even though, as pointed out repeatedly, the quality of this footage is, forthe most part, low quality consumer grade imagery. The value here is inmeasurable and supportive data - not cinematography. We are forced to workwithin the scope of the evidence at our disposal. We surely were notdisappointed with the analysis in this case.10.) Having measurable and known reference points and subject matter in thesequenced videos gave us supporting evidence to determining the approximatedistance, altitude, and size of the object.Before going into any more details as to the findings of this case here is avery brief summary background of the case that may be of interest.Three million attendees lined the lake front of Chicago for the annual Air andWater Show earlier that Saturday the 21st of August, 2004. Many began makingtheir way home as musician, Ozzie Osbourne, made his way off stage at the FirstMidwest Bank Amphitheatre (at the time known as the Tweeter Center) in TinleyPark. It was just after 10:00 p.m. when traffic was streaming on to the mainroads adjoining the interstate. Throughout the area, thousands were out enjoyingthis near perfect summer evening. Many were attending any one of numerous blockparties or backyard barbeques that evening. Suddenly, something very unusualcaught their attention. It was three brilliant, deep reddish illuminations thatremained motionless at times then slowly meandered silently across thiscloudless, starlit night sky. The flight path consisted of them moving from thesouth/southwest to the north/northeast then finally to the south/southeast. Hereon a day filled with captivating performances and festivities these three redlights would ultimately end up stealing the show by being far more memorable tothe observers.Some, lucky enough to have a camcorder on hand, captured this configuration asit rotated in perfect unison while maintaining altitude and position. It wasdescribed as beautiful yet unnerving .Within minutes, calls were flooding intothe Tinley Park Police and 911 center as well as those in many other surroundingcommunities.Peter Davenport at the National UFO Reporting Center was also receiving anunusual volume of calls regarding this event. Clearly, something was being seenin this highly populated area just south of Chicago and it wasn’t the Goodyearblimp.Directly above this area is one of the busiest air traffic corridors in theworld. Yet while these observations were being made, it was keenly noted thatall air traffic appeared to have ceased. Normal Air traffic resumed immediatelyafter the illuminations departed the area. For nearly two hours, the sky wasfree of conventional aircraft. This fact alone alarmed a good number ofcitizens.Roughly half an hour after the first spectacle cleared the area, anotherillumination appeared. This was reported as a single red illumination thatdidn’t linger over the area like the first. It moved along at a good rate ofspeed yet departing along a similar trajectory as the first series of lights asthough trying to catch up to it.It was on viewing the first video in a faster play mode followed by reversingthe same sequence that it became apparent these three red illuminations seemedto maintain a very consistent distance from one another. This geometric form ofan Isosceles triangle was clearly becoming discernible. If in fact theseilluminations were affixed to something that wasn’t visible in the video andwere being held in place, it would have been enormous in size as well as in itsconstruction.After reviewing two other videos and three photos, it was more than anassumption that the only variation was the perspective of the witness and/orrecording of the subject as the evidence was consistently pointing topotentially a single, structured object with a geometric triangularconfiguration. Though, of the many witnesses interviewed, only a few feltcertain they had seen a solid object or something connecting the illuminationsto each other.Another interesting observation that was overwhelmingly consistent with someaccounts from August 21st, 2004 was that the three large “red lights” were eachcomprised of three smaller illuminations. Separate yet equal in size andintensity each light appeared in a triangular configuration within the largerones. This observation was held by many of those who were in the eastern sectionof the village. One gentleman made this discovery through the use of atelescope. He was some three plus miles west of the other witnesses. Alsoreported were no less than three accounts of smaller objects seen leaving fromand returning to the large triangular object. One such report was from a policeofficer.Most reported a deep reddish hue to the “lights” somewhat similar to the manyradio tower beacons that can be seen throughout the area. A few reported, asthey stood directly under the object, a combination of rapidly alternatingcolored illuminations. This may have been when the object was much lower inaltitude.It was the October 31st, 2004 mass sighting that occurred just after 8:00 p.m.that yielded higher quality video evidence. In this case, the lights moved fromthe northwest to the southeast. After the event in August, several individualsand groups teamed up to form quick response teams complete with cameras in theevent a similar episode should occur. They did not have to wait long as theywere able to record the event from fixed positions this Halloween night. Theyalso were asked to give a constant narration of the event and all details whilefilming. It had also been suggested to keep reference objects in the field ofview, if future video footage was taken. It was T.J. again who captured somestunning video on this date. He captured a commercial jet flying between hisvantage point and the mystery object. Incorporating another video taken a fewblocks from T.J. further south, we were able to clearly see that the jet wasbetween T.J.’s field of view and the object. This put things into perspectivefor us.Thanks are extended to Terrence Masson and Dr. Ted Acworth who, while working ona UFO Hunters television episode dedicated to this very case, analyzed selectfootage. Their evaluation of footage and graphic illustrations of the estimatedthe size of the triangular object is nothing short of dynamic. They did anexcellent job getting the point across in the show that, whatever the nature ofthe object, it was many times larger than anything in our flying arsenal today.Those who independently drew similar calculations based off of the eyewitnesstestimony and video evaluation included Dr. Mark Rodeghier, Victor Connor, DavidFinkbeiner, David Marler, Dr. Michael Swords and many others who contributed tothis investigation.Of all the many unusual attributes to this anomalous massive triangular objectboth observed and recorded, the following may be a little known identifiablemaneuver worth noting.In at least two videos the object was recorded rotating its base below and aboveitself this is a very unusual maneuver clearly recorded and mentioned in thenarration. It was also included in one witness report (a phone interview) withan amateur astronomer who is also an attorney. He was shocked by this quickreconfiguration. I had also seen this very same arcing rotation in another videofrom southern Illinois taken on the evening of January 4th, 2000. This cleararcing motion from one side to the other then stopping in the very location theother illumination had occupied is a strong indication of structure. This entirerotation was accomplished in less time than an object in a state of free fall.This little demonstration infers, at the very least, a presence of structure.It should be noted that massive triangular craft have been seen in this samearea prior to and subsequent to these two incidents. However, this time, theygot it on videotape. I wish to thank my colleague, Sam Maranto, for his dedicated efforts ininvestigating this case. He, along with his Illinois MUFON investigators, workedtirelessly to interview the innumerable witnesses to both of these dramaticevents. Two reports Sam investigated demonstrate parallels to cases andcharacteristics previously mentioned. The first report involved a 48-year-old resident of Tinley Park who witnessedthe triangular formation of lights on August 21st, 2004 that many observed thatsame evening around 10:00 p.m. He noted the absence of any noise coming from thelights and watched them eventually disappear. However, approximately 45 minuteslater, an unusual solitary light was observed. The witness stated “A red lightcame down the same path and did the same thing (as the previous formation oflights). It made no noise, it floated very slowly right over the tops of all ourhouses. It appeared to stop and start again, turned right and disappeared.” Thesimilarities to other historical UFO reports involving solitary red lights thatfly in conjunction with triangular UFOs should be noted. Multiple examples ofthis occurred during the Belgian UFO wave from 1989 to 1991. The second report involved a father and daughter who were in two separatelocations in the general area of the First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre (at thetime known as the Tweeter Center) in Tinley Park on the night of October 31st,2004. The daughter who was to the north of her father’s location had observedwhat appeared to be a large triangular object in the sky. At the same time, thefather was observing a “horseshoe shaped-object” further to the south. Thistestimony is reminiscent of the case we reviewed earlier in the book fromBroager, Denmark. As the reader may recall, the witness there described a large,low-flying, triangular object that flew over the town of Broager in conjunctionwith a number of horseshoe-shaped objects that emerged from it. Could theseevents somehow be related? As amply demonstrated thus far, these triangular objects have been reportedworldwide. However, there have been multiple well-documented cases of thisnature reported in Illinois. Either this is due to an inordinate concentrationof activity there or due to me having lived in Illinois until recent years andbeing more privy to cases from that area. In either case, we now know of adocumented account from the year 1968 of a 1967 sighting as well as the January5th, 2000 incident that both occurred outside of Scott Air Force Base. Then, in2004, we have two multiple witness cases over the area of Tinley Park involvinghundreds, if not thousands, of eyewitnesses. History has repeated itself theremany times. But let us return to the overall scope of the book and examine casesinvolving a wider geographical distribution. More importantly, let us continueour examination of cases leading up to more current times and, ultimately, toour final assessment of this material. Chapter 10:Continual Reports and Implications We have examined historical reports in newspapers, military files, and thosein UFO literature. In addition, we have reviewed interview notes witheyewitnesses. We have conducted a detailed analysis of the commoncharacteristics associated with these objects and thereby created a workingprofile. These were used to illustrate the long history of triangular UFOs priorto the modern wave of sightings which was typified by the now-famous Belgianwave of 1989-1991. Before moving to the conclusions of this report, a review should be made ofmore recent sightings to demonstrate the continuity of reports. We touched on afew in the previous chapter. Let us examine some others that have occurred afterthe Belgian wave concluded in 1991. By no means is this phenomenon somethingthat happened in the past tense. This phenomenon continues to occur! In March of 1992, reports of triangular objects were continuing to bereported worldwide. The Union Leader of Manchester, New Hampshire published adramatic sighting that occurred two days earlier on March 3rd. At 7:50 p.m.,Roger Cross was driving to Manchester on Route 3A in Concord, New Hampshire whenheard an unusual sound he later described as “sounding like increasing rain on asummer night on a canvas tent.” He pulled his car over to the side of the roadand witnessed a triangular object that was immense in size and flying 400 to 500feet above the road. The object had pulsating lights. The radio station, WNNH, in Henniker stated they had received “very seriouscalls” about a similar object the next morning. The sightings began around 6:00p.m. and filtered in from the cities of Claremont, Newport, Bradford, Salisbury,Penacook, as well as Concord. While back in England, reports of a similar nature continued as well. TheJanuary 21st, 1993 edition of the Ashbourne News Telegraph of Derbyshire ran astory entitled: “UFO spotters chase mysterious ‘flashing triangle’.” It recountsthe story of an Ellastone family who, upon seeing a massive triangular UFO abovetheir home, gave chase after it in their car when they lost sight of it. Theobject was described as very large, silent, with flashing lights all around it.Others in the area reported similar sightings. In February, similar sightings were being reported in southeastern Wisconsin.The Shepherd Express of Milwaukee Wisconsin ran a comprehensive story in theirJune 17th edition that described these. The first triangular UFO report in thearea occurred around 9:00 p.m. on February 1st. A young man was driving home toCedarburg, Wisconsin when he noticed a large, black, triangular UFO hoveringabove a Cedarburg water tank. The object reportedly had nine lights on it thatincluded a row of bright lights on one side. He reported his sighting to thelocal police. Two police officers in Cedarburg had witnessed bright beams oflight in the vicinity of the reported sighting, but didn’t realize thesignificance until they later received the UFO report. Another sighting occurred February 4th near Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin andinvolved a man, Kevin Crump, and his grandmother, Betty Barnick. Atapproximately 6:35 p.m., they saw a fire truck drive by with lights on. Theythen began to look around to see if they could see smoke or a fire nearby. Itwas at this point, they spotted something in the sky. The object was firstthought to be a low-flying plane. Crump stated “Then all of a sudden it shot outa blue glowing ball from the tail-end of the craft. It looked like a flame ballfrom a roman candle. It shot out about two inches, in ground to sky distance,with a trail of twinkling lights. The blue ball just hung in the sky over theold school to our left.” Crump then pulled his car over to the side of the road and exited thevehicle. Barnick stayed inside. Crump stated “I looked up and saw the ship justabout directly overhead. I could see a faint outline of the ship because themoon was above it.” He continued “The moonlight reflected off the black metallicsurface. It was the shape of an oblong triangle with a light at each point – ared and a blue light at the front and a white light at the back.” A feature we have become familiar with was reported in this case as well. Thecraft was characterized as unusual due to the way it traveled – the base was theleading edge of the object and the point was at the back. The UFO eventuallymoved away, but then returned. Crump noted “There it was in the sky, and it wasnot alone. There was another bright light below it above the trees. It was atremendous bright light, brighter than any star or planet in the sky. There wasa flashing light way up high. At first I thought it was a plane; there wereplanes in the area at this time. But I realized that it might be the blue ballthat shot out of the ship.” Crump provided a sketch. [images/00062.jpg] Later the same year, a Muskegon, Michigan newspaper, The Chronicle, ran anews article titled “Two see unidentified ‘triangle of lights’.” The article,dated April 28th, discussed two sightings of a triangular array of lights twodays prior. Two separate witnesses had called in their reports to the newspaper. One witness, a 54-year old Muskegon woman was walking her dog around 11:20p.m. She noticed two red lights and a white light arranged in a triangularconfiguration hovering over Muskegon Lake. She added the lights appeared to belinked by a grey triangle with rounded corners. The lights were then observed tohave separated with the white light shooting across the sky so fast the witnessstated “I almost broke my neck tracking it.” The red lights then moved back andforth like pendulums before moving to the south. Roughly 20 miles to the north, in Whitehall, another witness was walking hisdog around the same time. The 49-year old man reported seeing three lights inthe sky similar to the Muskegon witness – two red and one white. This witnessstated the white light seemed to consist of three white lights in a triangularpattern. The lights were observed for approximately 3 minutes while they hoveredsilently. They then moved off and disappeared. The Hucknall Dispatch of Nottingham, England published a sighting reportinvolving a husband/wife sighting of a triangular UFO in their March 11th, 1994issue. The man, who wished to remain anonymous, described the encounter he andhis wife had in Bestwood Village (date not given). They were driving at the timeof their sighting and saw the object “hanging in the sky.” They pulled to theside of the road and exited their vehicle to get a better look. The man described the sighting “It had three lights in a triangular formationand seemed to be only 200 ft from the ground. It was big – about the size of a747 airliner – and it had white, green, and red lights that were steady and verybright.” His wife was so amazed by what they were seeing that she fell to theground in disbelief. Her husband observed the object’s underside as being greyin color that had a cross-ribbed pattern across it. The object was described as being huge yet eerily silent. The object thenbegan to move off slowly in the direction of Hucknall. Reportedly, it thenaccelerated at a high speed making a sharp change of direction while doing so.The object then disappeared to the south while never appearing to alter itsaltitude. A similar object was observed in March of 1996 over Southport in Merseyside,England as reported in the March 8th edition of the Visitor. The title of thearticle was “Mystery in the evening skies – Was ‘Flying Triangle’ an alien craftover town?” The article described multiple UFO sightings by local residents. A motorist observed an unusual object on March 1st around 6 p.m. when hedrove past a nearby field. He stated “The thing was unreal. It was sort oftriangle-shaped with a white light in each corner and a square green light inthe middle. It remained motionless for at least five minutes. By that timeseveral cars had stopped and the drivers and passengers were standing by theircars watching in amazement. Suddenly, the object started going round the fieldfor a minute or two. Then it stopped and the lights gathered together. Now, itwas just one big green light and, without warning, it just flew off.” This isyet one more example of these objects changing shape while under observation. Another case from 1996 was documented in the March 15th edition of theRomford Recorder in Essex, England. This occurred just eight days after thesighting in Southport. On March 9th, a triangular UFO was observed by two groupsof motorists around 10:50 p.m. in the area known as Gallows Corner. The objectwas described as being as large as a football pitch and having a white light ateach corner with a pulsating orange light in the center of it. Three men were inone vehicle and an elderly couple in the other one. Both groups observed theobject and drew similar sketches for local investigators. In October 1996, another news article appeared entitled “Several sightings of‘triangular, orange UFO’.” This was in the October 3rd edition of theWalthamstow Guardian of London, England. It detailed the sighting of a local manwho sighted an orange triangular UFO on September 27th. More importantly, itreferred to a wave of similar sightings in the greater London area over the pastfew weeks. The triangle sightings over England continued with intensity for the years1995 and 1996 but still continued to trickle in the subsequent years as well.The Post of Stafford recorded some of these reports in their April 9th, 1998issue. The article is here quoted describing two reports: > “A new wave of UFO sightings have [sic] been reported by Stafford> residents. Triangular shaped crafts with lights were spotted around the area> between March 27 and 30. A black triangular object with a white light at each> corner was seen over Pennycroft Flats, Stafford at 8:30 p.m. on April 30. It> was travelling at about 2,500ft and completely noiseless.> In a separate incident at 8:30 p.m. on March 27 a similar craft, this time> with red, blue and white lights, was spotted over the A51 (motorway). It was> silent and travelling in a westerly direction at a very low height.” Later in 1998, another article surfaced in the County Times of Welshpool,Wales. This news story, dated June 12th, was entitled “UFOs spotted near Llani.”The article goes on to state that three triangular-shaped objects were sightedsimultaneously by a Newtown resident and his girlfriend while driving on June5th. The man, Paul Best, is quoted in the article as follows: > “I saw three triangular-shaped planes, which were below the clouds, sometime> after half past 10 in the evening. They were perfect triangles, with a round> shape underneath. I got out of the car to watch them and for seven or eight> minutes they were stationary, they weren’t even hovering it was like they were> just stuck in the air. Then they started moving very, very slowly, before> shooting off very quickly.” Best stated they were unlike any aircraft he had seen before includingpictures of the B2 Stealth Bomber. He added “They weren’t flying saucers. Ididn’t have any sense of them being extra terrestrial [sic] or anything likethat. I thought they were just really weird looking planes.” This last comment is important in that the witness was not framing this as aUFO sighting per se. They were unidentified flying objects in the literal senseof the term, but he was not attributing them to anything beyond this. Rightlyso, he thought these were aircraft of some unknown type. In 1999, the area of Derbyshire, England was again being frequented bytriangular UFOs based on the newspapers reports. The Belper News of March 24thran an article entitled “ ‘Black wedge’ seen in skies over town.” It recountedthe details of a series of sightings over the areas of Brinsley, Crich, andBelper. Again, a familiar observation was reported. The blunt end of the wedgewas at the front of the object as it flew at an estimated 30 miles per hour. Theobject also reportedly had two bright white headlights. One eyewitness interviewed was from Brinsley. He commented “I know thataerodynamically something of that shape should not be flying.” The day after hissighting, he overheard a woman describing the same object she apparently hadsighted. In her case, she observed the object change from a diamond-shape into atriangular form. The article also referenced veteran UFO researcher, Omar Fowler, who wasleading the investigations into these reports along with his group, ThePhenomenon Research Association. It should be noted that over the years leadingup to this latest wave of sightings, Fowler and his team were doggedlyinvestigating and cataloging similar reports stretching back through the 1990s. While the American media attention was focused on southern Illinois and theJanuary 5th, 2000 UFO incident, triangular UFOs continued to frequent the skiesof England into the 21st century. The Rochdale Observer of Lancashire reported adetailed account in their July 5th, 2000 edition. The sighting occurred overLittleborough and the primary witness, Ceri Kenyon, was a resident there. While walking home one evening (date not provided), he initially observed aflickering light in the sky. As he approached closer, he heard a strange buzzingsound and could clearly see a distinctly outlined object. He is quoted asfollows: > I looked straight up at it and could see there were lots of red and blue> lights. I could also hear a buzzing sound like a vacuum cleaner. From the> underneath it was almost triangular in shape because the lights went around> it. It was hovering above some flats and moving ever so slightly (see Ceri’s> sketch). [images/00057.jpg] As Ceri observed this, two other people appeared on the scene and observedthe same thing. Ceri stated “I stopped two lads and asked them if they could seeit. I asked them if it was just me but they said ‘no mate, there’s something upthere’. He finally added “It looked like there was a kind of energy around it.”The lateral view of the object as sketched by Ceri resembles Melvern Noll’s UFOreport from January 5th, 2000 regarding rectangular windows being observed. One aspect of the article beyond the sighting report was a commentary by thelate UFO researcher, Graham Birdsall. He stated “We have received a telephonecall from someone in Manchester who saw a triangular object last month. We havebeen getting reports over the years of these so-called ‘flying triangles’ fromall over the world. Some people think this is the latest stealth technology butwonder what it is doing over populated areas. These sightings are surely amatter of significance in terms of safety. These people on the ground who seethem are not alone. There are people seeing them from the air and logging them.” On September 28th, the Cannock Chase Post of Wolverhampton, England ran anarticle entitled “FLYING TRIANGLES OF THE CHASE.” The article stated “For thevast majority of people, any mention of the term UFO inevitably conjures upimages of Flying Saucers and similar shaped objects. Over the course of the lastfew years, however, our investigations into the UFO mysteries of Cannock Chasehave shown us that an increasing number of people are now reporting encounterswith a distinctly different type of UFO – one that has become known as theFlying Triangle.” The article then continued by discussing cases and researchers involved intheir investigation including Omar Fowler who we referenced earlier. Finally,the newspaper article provided contact info for those who wished to report theirown UFO sightings to the paper. On December 21st, a follow-up article was published titled, “Tale of a Chasehi-tech triangle.” This article mentioned the influx of letters andcorrespondence they received as a result of their request for reports back inSeptember. They indicated the UFO reports received covered the last 20 years forthe surrounding area. On such report involved a father and son who were driving at the time oftheir sighting. It was in the autumn of 1985 around 8:30 p.m. As they rounded abend in the road, they saw a large, black, triangular-shaped object stationaryin the sky. The distance from the object was estimated to be 100 feet. Theestimated altitude was a mere 150 feet. The object had a bright light at eachpoint of the triangle. The two exited their vehicle and observed this spectacle. The silent objectmaintained a stationary position for some time over some trees. Suddenly, theobject shot away at an incredible speed. The father and son then quickly headedhome where they contacted the police to report their sighting. From 2007 to 2011, reports of triangular UFOs were occasionally reported inthe Express & Star of Wolverhampton, England. One of the earliest reportsreferred to the UFO as resembling a huge “Dorito” crisp or snack chip due to itstriangular shape. From this point on, it would be referenced as the “DoritoUFO.” During this timeframe, reports trickled in from the areas of Halesowen,Stourbridge, Bushbury, Wollaston, Wallows Wood, Wednesfield, Dudley, Tipton,Boldmere, Oldbury, Clent, and Kidderminster. In all cases, the object wasdescribed as triangular. Regarding more recent reports, it might be assumed that more triangular UFOsightings occur in England versus other countries. Indeed, a large percentage ofreports derive from there. However, many similar sightings have occurred in theUnited States as well. However, the media in the United Kingdom appear to bemore open to reporting the subject than their American counterparts. Progressively over the years, there have been fewer newspaper reports in theUnited States that focus on UFO sightings. This may be partly due to thedecreasing number of actual newspapers still in publication. In cases wherestories are printed, the news articles often focus on UFO researchers orconventions as opposed to the UFO sightings themselves. Of course they are stillreported, but to a much lesser degree than in the U.K. In relation to this, it should be mentioned there is a shortage of triangularUFO reports coming from non-English speaking countries. Over time, I hope tosecure contacts in these countries and establish an information exchange system.In a small number of cases, it has been demonstrated that triangular UFOs aresighted and reported. One example was from our Project Blue Book reviewinvolving a report from Indonesia in 1957. I would suspect the lack of reportsis not indicative of a lack of sightings. Rather, it may be attributed to simplelanguage barriers making it difficult to obtain such reports. As referenced earlier in the book, one of the largest collections of raw UFOsighting reports in North America, if not the world, is the long-standingNational UFO Reporting Center (www.ufocenter.com) based in Washington State.Peter Davenport serves as its Director. Peter has worked tirelessly for over 17years day-in and day-out without a salary to document UFO sighting reports. Ihave known and worked with Peter on past UFO cases since 1995 and am proud tocall him my friend and colleague. He is truly one of the most underratedindividuals in the field of UFO research today. Peter has graciously allowed me to share the following cases courtesy of TheNational UFO Reporting Center. These serve as some of the more dramatic anddetailed reports in Peter’s files regarding triangular UFOs: THE PALOUSE, EASTERN WASHINGTON, DECEMBER 29, 1994 @ 21:45 HRS. (PDT)A mother was driving home along Highway 127 with her six children, headed totheir home in the town of La Crosse, Washington, located in the wheat growingregion of southeastern Washington State (south of Spokane).Since it was already late at night, the mother decided to take a shortcut byturning northwest onto Zaring Cutoff Road, in lieu of continuing east to Dusty,Washington, thereby reducing the remaining mileage home by approximately eightmiles. Little did the mother realize at the time how fateful a decision she hadjust made!As the family proceeded northwest on Zaring Cutoff Road, the mother looked offto her right, and noticed three very bright yellow lights that seemed to be outin the middle of a large field. She commented to her children what bright lightsthose “18 wheelers” had, momentarily overlooking the fact that large trucks donot operate in the middle of snow covered fields in late December!Her children quickly responded that the lights were not attached to trucks atall, but rather, they were something quite different. The mother glanced back atthe lights, and immediately realized that her children were correct, and thatshe was looking at something that she had never seen before. Curious as to whatthe three strange objects were, she stopped her car on the highway, shut off theengine, and rolled down the driver’s window.Within seconds of having stopped the car, the mother realized that they were alllooking at three triangular craft, each of which appeared to have “stubbywings,” and each of which had a very bright light on its nose which shone on theground ahead of the craft.The three objects, which moved slowly in front of the car from right to left,passed over the highway and into the field on the witnesses’ left side. Nosooner had they done that, than all three, as if on the same command, rotatedapproximately ninety degrees in the horizontal plane, and began moving parallelwith the highway, so they were now moving in the opposite direction that the carwas pointing! In addition, the objects seemed to have kept their original, andunwavering, formation, relative to one another!The mother was badly frightened by the spectacle unfolding before her eyes, butthere was not a thing she could do but watch and try to record the facts of theevent.As the objects passed down the left side of and above the family’s vehicle, themother had a very clear and close-up view of the three objects. She could seethat each of the craft appeared to have a type of “window,” or “louver,” on theventral part of its fuselage, from which a peculiar blue-colored light was seen.In addition, she could detect a peculiar “whining,” or “buzzing” sound thatemanated from, she thought, the same window. The mother likened the sound tothat of a refrigerator motor, or a hydraulic pump, running at high speed.After the objects had disappeared from sight, the mother started her vehicle,and proceeded to their home in La Crosse, Washington.Two days after the incident, the mother telephone the National UFO ReportingCenter UFO Hotline, and provided a detailed report of the sighting. Toward theend of that conversation, she admitted that she had been so frightened by theincident she was unable to force herself to go outside after dark, out of fearthat she might see the objects again! [images/00018.jpg] [images/00047.jpg] KIRKLAND, WASHINGTON, DECEMBER 03RD, 1998, @ 23:30 HRS. (PACIFIC)After attending the opera at the Seattle Center, two adult women drove back toKirkland, Washington, located on the east side of Lake Washington, where both ofthem resided.After the driver had dropped off her friend, she proceeded to drive toward herown home. When she was just a block or two north of her home, the woman noticeda strange cluster of five lights in the night sky to the south. Two of thelights were large and white, with an equally large red light between and behindthem. Also, there were two much smaller lights on either side of the largerlights in the center.As she continued driving toward her neighborhood, the woman continued to keep aneye on the peculiar lights. The lights seemed to be drawing closer to her, andthe driver became increasingly alarmed. Frightened by the presence of thisthreatening object, the woman suddenly accelerated her car; quickly turned intoher driveway; and pulled into the garage hoping to conceal herself from thebizarre object, as quickly as possible.However, as she pulled into her driveway, she was able to look upward at theobject just as it passed overhead. What she saw appeared to be a dark,equilateral triangle with two large white lights close to the leading vertex ofthe triangle and a large red light located between, and slightly behind, thosetwo white lights. Two smaller white lights were located on either side of thethree larger lights and close to the trailing vertices of the triangle.The woman reported the sighting to the National UFO Reporting Center shortlyafter the event had occurred. She emphasized how genuinely bizarre the objectwas and the fact that it seemed to be absolutely silent as it passed overhead.It was not a commercial airliner or military aircraft, she was certain.The witness was flabbergasted by the event and reported it to the National UFOReporting Center telephone hotline on the night of the sighting. CHALLIS, IDAHO, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2000, @ 21:45 HRS. (MDT)Four adult males, all experienced outdoorsmen, were camped at a rural huntingsite near Challis, Idaho where they had camped almost annually over the previoustwo decades. The purpose of their trip was to survey the area for game inpreparation for the upcoming Idaho big game hunting season.At approximately 21:45 hours, after the men had spent the evening viewing videofootage of animals they had encountered and photographed earlier in the day, oneof the four men exited the trailer and walked to his pick-up truck to retrievefood from a food locker for dinner. As he placed his foot on the rear tire of the truck, and swung up onto the truckbed, his small “Mini-Mag” flashlight swept across the night sky suddenlyilluminating something directly above him! The witness instantly glanced upwardand was flabbergasted to see a strange looking, massive, dark, triangular-shapedobject sitting motionless above him! It was so massive that it seemed toblanket the entire campsite!The witness was so shocked by what he was looking at that he fell back down tothe ground and, lying on his back, started yelling for the others to come out ofthe trailer immediately!Two of the men inside, one of them the younger brother of the first witness,rushed out of the trailer thinking that their colleague was perhaps beingattacked by a bear. Just as they exited the trailer, lights on the strange craftabove camp turned on making the object much more visible and prominent in thenight sky than it had been just seconds earlier. The three witnesses stoodseemingly mesmerized by the object hovering above them! Then it began to slowly and silently move away from their camp and headed towarda nearby range of mountains. The men quickly retrieved high-quality binocularsfrom their trucks which permitted them to discern fine detail on the craft andto follow it closely as it glided toward the nearby mountains. When it arrivedat the side of mountains, the object tipped its nose upward and it slowlyascended up the side of the mountain. When it reached the top of the mountain,it tipped forward; passed over the mountain; and disappeared from their sight.The men sat in camp discussing for an hour or so what they had just witnessed.The two brothers decided that they were not going to spend another night at thatcampsite! They loaded their hunting rifles; climbed into their truck; and drovefor more than an hour and a half to the nearest town, Challis, Idaho. Oncethere, they rented a motel room and spent the night. The next morning, the two brothers, one of whom was a licensed pilot, contactedthe Boise, Idaho office of the Federal Aviation Administration, and recountedtheir story to an employee of that agency who seemed to address the matterseriously. Later that same afternoon, the two brothers drove back to the camp not knowingwhat to expect. As they approached the camp, they were surprised to see a U. S.Air Force F-16 fighter jet pass over the general area.They were relieved to find the camp to be in the same condition it had been thenight before and to find their two hunting companions still alive and well. However, the two men who had remained in the camp reported that earlier thatmorning a USAF F-16 jet fighter had flown directly over the camp at extremelyhigh speed. It appeared to follow the same pathway that the triangular craft hadfollowed during the previous evening! That first aircraft had flown overapproximately one hour after the two brothers had recounted to the FAA what hadoccurred the night before causing them to wonder whether the over-flights were aresult of their having reported their sighting to the FAA earlier that morning. I wish to extend my thanks again to Peter Davenport and the National UFOReporting Center for sharing these accounts. As demonstrated by this sampling,the working profile established earlier in the book is reinforced by thesereports. There is overall continuity in the narratives themselves despite minorvariances. However, the December 29th, 1994 Washington State sighting is anexample of how some triangular UFO reports deviate from the straightforwardequilateral or elongated triangle shape. Some reports mention appendages orslight variations in the basic triangular design as evidenced in this case. Again, I do not rule out the possibility that some triangular UFO reports maybe attributed to advanced military aircraft resembling the basic triangularshape. However, in this Washington case, the ability of these three craft that“rotated approximately ninety degrees in the horizontal plane” is suggestive ofnon-traditional propulsion technologies. Another example of a triangular UFO report that does not fit the establishedprofile derives from a highly-publicized UFO case. The case is often referred toas the “Rendlesham Forest Incident” or the “Bentwaters-Woodbridge Incident.”Without going into too much detail due to the intricacies of the case and due tomuch already being written about it, the series of incidents involved multipleUFOs being reported by military and civilians in and around theBentwaters-Woodbridge Air Bases in Suffolk, England in late December 1980. Bothbases were nestled in an area known as Rendlesham Forest. Stationed there weremembers of the RAF as well as United States Air Force personnel. Of particular note was the sighting by one of the American servicemen of arelatively small triangular UFO that was observed hovering just above theground. He was not only able to see the object, but was able to walk up andtouch it. He had a notebook with him at the time of the sighting and noted thefollowing: “'Triangular in shape. The top portion is producing mainly whitelight which encompasses most of the upper section of the craft. A small amountof white light is appearing from what appears to be the bottom of the craft. Atthe left side is a bluish light. And on the other side is red. The lights seemto be molded as part of the exterior of the structure.” The silent objectreportedly was nine feet wide by nine feet tall. When the serviceman touched theobject it felt like “black glass.” He wrote an additional note: “On this smoothexterior shell, there is writing of some kind. I'm not sure what it is. Size3-inch lettering. (It) may be symbols that stretch for a length of 2 feet. Maybea little more.” He added that the symbols appeared to be “etched or engraved”into the object. For a full forty-five minutes, the serviceman walked around the entire craft;sketched the object; took at least 35 black and white photographs; before thething began to elevate a few feet above the ground. It then proceeded tomaneuver its way through the woods for approximately 25 to 30 meters. It thenhovered momentarily before rising roughly 250 feet above the treetops. Then, itabruptly just disappeared. The serviceman’s notes survived. However, thephotographs were submitted to the base’s photo lab never to be seen again. This is just one of a series of bizarre UFO incidents that occurred inRendlesham Forest in December of 1980. The reader is encouraged to research thiscase further, if interested. Much has been written on the subject. However, thisbrief review serves to illustrate yet one more triangular UFO report that doesnot conform to the typical profile we are familiar with. If and how thesevariants relate to the more standardized reports is a question that remainsunknown. However, it demonstrates that not all triangular UFO reports arehomogeneous in nature. I understand these accounts, like so many others we reviewed, are based oneyewitness testimony. Such information is not always 100% accurate. There arelimitations to visual perception, interpretation, as well as recollection. Thatbeing said, this same eyewitness testimony can be used in a court of law to helpconvict someone of a violent crime. So either eyewitness testimony is valid orit isn’t. Where do we draw the line? Personally, I find it difficult to accept that all of the testimony we havereviewed can be dismissed as misidentifications, hallucinations, and outrightlies. If just one of the cases we reviewed occurred exactly as described, thenwe are dealing with a genuine mystery. Individually, we all must weigh theevidence and develop our own conclusions. However, our chronological review now brings us to the current time period.Faced with this phenomenon, what steps can be taken to deal with the situation?Unfortunately, as individuals and civilians, there is not much that can be done.Maintaining an open mind towards the subject is the best option available. It should be added that there is nothing constructive that can come from true“UFO believers” who accept every story as fact and promulgate conspiracytheories and develop a quasi-religion out of the phenomenon. Within the UFOresearch field itself, there has developed a central belief system that manyadhere to involving crashed UFOs, government cover-ups, alien abductions, jointmilitary/alien operations, etc. Regardless of any validity that one mightascribe to these topics, individuals who question any one aspect of these may beconsidered subversive or part of the “government UFO cover-up” themselves. Theoverriding mentality is one of blind faith and acceptance of every UFO case thatpresents itself, regardless of how outlandish it appears. Conversely, the ardent skeptics contribute little of value either. Theirattitude is to simply take a contrary position against anything UFO-related.Most of the so-called “skeptics” typically do not engage in actualinvestigations and resort to tactics involving character assassination of thewitnesses whom they have often never met. These skeptics will usually makegeneralized statements that often have little or no bearing on a case. Theprosaic explanations for UFO sightings offered by them usually only fit some ofthe facts in a given case while ignoring others. Specific to the triangular UFO mystery, many skeptics have advanced thenotion that modern-day UFOs are being described as triangular due to theinfluence of science-fiction television programs in the 1990s (e.g., TheX-Files, Dark Skies, etc.). However, as our historical examination has shown,triangular UFO reports pre-date these television shows by decades at the veryleast. The actual UFO sightings occurred – then the television shows followed.It is yet another example of art imitating life. The same was true of theclassic flying saucer reports of the late1940s and 1950s. Skeptics made the samearguments that these reports were inspired by Hollywood movies. However, thefact of the matter is that “saucer” sightings occurred first followed by theirbig screen counterparts. I do not mean to suggest being skeptical is not warranted. It is apre-requisite in order to approach the subject objectively. Some criticisms madeby skeptics have been valid over the years and have illustrated errors orinvalid assumptions on the part of UFO investigators. Healthy skepticism coupledwith an open mind is the formula for serious investigation into this elusivesubject matter. Again, as stated at the beginning of this book, I consider myself as one whois skeptical yet open-minded. I am not alone in this category. Despite thepercentages of “UFO believers” and “skeptics” that pervade this area of study,it should be noted there is still a large percentage of individuals who aresomewhere in the middle of this continuum. They do not fall into the mindset ofoutright acceptance or rejection of the phenomenon. These are educated, logicalindividuals who have taken the time to evaluate the material and have followed aprocess of deduction. In this process, many UFO reports have been evaluated and rejected based onlack of evidence; misidentifications; hoaxes; inconsistencies in the report; thequestionable character of the reporting eyewitness; or the inability to verifythe identity of the reporting eyewitness. Likewise, many other UFO reports may pass this evaluation process and bedeemed credible. Each UFO investigator or organization may have their own set ofcriteria that determines this. Unfortunately, there is a lack of uniformity inevaluation criteria within the field. Regardless, any seasoned UFO investigatorwill admit the best thing we can say regarding a UFO case, assuming all prosaicexplanations have been ruled out, is that the UFO appears to be a genuine“unknown.” We cannot say what the UFO actually was; we can only state what itwas not. This frustrates many investigators, but we must be honest with ourselves andthe general public. In cases where a UFO has been investigated and conventionalexplanations eliminated as the cause, people will press you to say what youthink it was. I have always stated “There is no shame in saying ‘We don’tknow’.” We cannot fall into the slippery slope of speculation that leadsabsolutely nowhere. We must only go where the facts lead us. It is thisoverriding philosophy in conjunction with our review of case material that leadsus to the next step. Having reviewed the body of evidence, we now need to examine thepossibilities and ramifications of what all of this means. Like this book’snamesake, the 1948 Estimate of the Situation, this report will now provideconclusions and recommendations based on the available material reviewed. Theseare written in accordance with an analyst’s report being submitted to officialmilitary/government authorities on the subject as a briefing paper. Chapter 11:Conclusion Discussion: These triangular UFO reports are not ambiguous, like the majority of UFOsover the years, involving simple “lights-in-the-sky.” These are apparentlystructured craft of appreciable size. They appear to defy physics as we know it.The overall consistency in reports over decades indicates a specific subset ofUFOs. Their worldwide distribution cannot be ignored and rules out simple hoaxesas a valid explanation. Numerous multiple-witness cases rules out hallucinationsas a plausible explanation. Low-altitude flights of these objects moving belowcloud cover rules out astronomical explanations (e.g., meteors). Objects hoverand move slowly similar to blimps, but perform flight dynamics (e.g., rapidacceleration from stationary position) unlike the most advanced aircraft knownto us. Absence of sonic booms when tracked visually and by radar exceeding thesound barrier remains unexplained. Radar confirmation exists in some cases tobolster eyewitness reports. Behaviors of the objects suggest intelligent control(e.g., evasive maneuvers and interaction with observers). Behaviors also suggestreticence to appear openly as suggested by the predominance of nighttimesightings. Absence of noise and exhaust suggests non-traditional propulsionsystem (e.g., not combustion-based). Absence of landing traces is notable aswell as related physical effects to surrounding objects with only fewexceptions, despite very low flight observations (e.g., a few feet above theground). Definitive photographic or video evidence requires further exploration.Imagery captured thus far has not proven conclusive. The military explanation for the source of the objects is not supported bythe evidence due to the long history of reports coupled with the fact theobjects do not appear to improve technologically over time. Reports arestrangely consistent over decades. This does not compare to typical aircraftdesign and development that shows a progression of technological advancementover time. If military in origin, what was the planned mission of this craft? Ifdesigned for military use, why in the last several decades have there never beenreports of these objects being observed in military theater operations? Ifmilitary in origin, logistical questions come into play. Where are these largecraft being housed? Why is there an absence of reports involving take-offs andlandings? How many technicians, engineers, support teams would be required tomaintenance these craft on a regular basis? If originating from the UnitedStates, are we operating these craft over populated areas of foreign nationswithout their permission? Are we operating in commercial airspace withoutauthorization as in the Manchester Airport air-miss incident of January 6th,1995? It is inconceivable that advanced top secret military aircraft would be flownover populated areas and in commercial airspace. The risk to the secrecy of suchprojects, the military assets involved, and safety of citizens rules this outaltogether. Any claims to the contrary must have supporting evidence. Unfoundedclaims made by so-called “insiders” who worked on military projects involvingtriangular craft cannot be accepted at face value. These individuals must offerevidence of these claims. Conclusions: These are craft of unknown origin. We appear to be confronted with somethingother than human technology, therefore the implications are profound. Theobjects may be spatial, temporal, or dimensional in origin. From a military perspective, given the volume of testimony and technologicalconfirmation in some cases, attention must be given to this subset of UFOreports, if not the subject in general. Unknown aircraft of superior design andoperation moving at will through secured airspaces and in proximity to militarybases (e.g., Scott AFB) should be considered of importance to national securityuntil proven otherwise. The default position military officials should maintainregarding this subject is one of vigilance. We should be on guard despite thefact the data suggests these objects do not appear to be overtly hostile inintent. However, in not knowing what their ultimate goal(s) may be, it cannot beassumed their past benign behaviors will always be status quo. The possibilityexists for a change in their modus operandi at any time based on variables wecan only imagine. Such a potential threat should mandate that contingency plans are in place onthe part of our military. Futile though this may seem, given the apparenttechnological gap between us and this outside intelligence, defense strategiesshould be established. In conjunction with this, plans to maximize publiceducation and minimize public panic should be an integral part of thiscontingency plan. Preemptive efforts might be considered to gradually acclimatethe public to the reality of UFOs and their existence to minimize the potentialdamage done to the collective psyche were such a phenomenon to suddenly andovertly present itself. Conversely, the public position towards the subject on the part of governmentand military leaders should be one of disinterest. This is to avoid thepotential fear that could be generated by any form of public endorsement orvalidation of the phenomenon, until such a time when hard facts and additionalinsights into the phenomenon are established. The subject cannot be acknowledgedpublicly until military leaders have a full understanding of what they aredealing with, in addition to the related sociological ramifications. In theinterim, the policy should be to control the perception of the phenomenon, sincethe phenomenon itself cannot be managed. Recommendations: • Coordinate a centralized collection system of worldwide UFO reports and data• Establish multi-disciplinary scientific teams to evaluate UFO information• Develop an inter-agency intelligence group to assess the UFO situation• Create protocol for military interaction with UFOs• Examine scenarios for eventual public education and acknowledgment of thephenomenon These are my conclusions and recommendations, based on the systematic reviewof the material. Whereas the recommendations for government and militaryofficials are presented as hypothetical policies and procedures, some believethese mechanisms are already in place by various governments to manage thephenomenon. While military officials may make plans and remain vigilant, these sightingscontinue to occur. With each new witness observing these strange craft, anotherperson’s life is affected in a deeply profound way. I have interviewed many UFOeyewitnesses who have stated to me point blank “If you came in here a year agosaying you investigated UFOs, I would have told you there’s the door.” Theywould then state that, despite having little or no interest in the subjectpreviously, they saw something that they can’t explain and now they need tore-evaluate this whole subject, themselves, and the world they live in. Itborders on a religious experience for many people in that it is extremelytransformative. For some, it creates a paradigm-shift. They rarely view theworld the same way subsequent to such an event. This brings us to the subject of proof. Merriam-Webster defines proof as: (a)the cogency of evidence that compels acceptance by the mind of a truth or afact; (b) the process or an instance of establishing the validity of a statementespecially by derivation from other statements in accordance with principles ofreasoning Therefore, proof is based on evidence. But Merriam-Webster defines evidenceas: (a) an outward sign : indication (b) something that furnishes proof :testimony; specifically: something legally submitted to a tribunal to ascertainthe truth of a matter. Evidence itself can be a subjective term for many people. The sighting of aUFO by someone may constitute enough evidence for them to accept the reality ofUFOs. Obviously, this may not mean much to you or others, though. I considerthis “personal evidence.” Then there are scenarios that may involve multiplewitness sightings and radar tracking data. This would be an example of“circumstantial evidence.” Compelling though this is, it doesn’t mean much tothe scientists at-large. They are looking for “hard evidence.” This consists ofphysical materials and data that can be analyzed and measured by multiplelaboratories where results can be verified and replicated. This is how science operates. It is a commendable pursuit and approach.Certainly, the weight of evidence is measured differently in the scientificworld than that of our legal systems. However, the scientific method is based onthe premise that we can control all variables when examining any given subjectmatter. It assumes that “we” are superior to the world we live in and the thingswe study. Well, how does the traditional scientific method apply to the subject ofUFOs? In my humble opinion, it doesn’t. First of all, we are not sure what weare dealing with regarding the subject of UFOs. The parameters of the phenomenonare unknown to us. Beyond this, how do we identify the variables associated withsuch a mysterious phenomenon? Further still, if we are dealing with a superiorintelligence, we are clearly not in control of the situation. Finally, thequestion remains “How far in advance could this ‘intelligence’ be of us?” The estimated age of the universe is considered to be 13.75 billion yearsold. The estimated age of the Earth is 4.54 billion years old. In relation, theestimated age of early humans (Homo habilis) is only 2.3 million years old. Whenexamining the universe and our place in its history, is it really thatimplausible that intelligent beings could exist that are thousands if notmillions of years ahead of us in technology? Being conservative, let’s askourselves “What would technology look like to us that is in advance of ours by athousand years?” Before we even begin to speculate on that point, take into consideration theadvancements in our own technology over the last 100+ years. The Wright brothersmade the first controlled, powered and sustained heavier than air flight, onDecember 17, 1903. Fast forward to April 12, 1961 when Yuri Gagarin, became thefirst human to go into outer space and orbit the Earth. Then on July 20, 1976the Viking 1 Lander touched down on the surface of the planet Mars. This is justone series of examples. We could also look at how methods of communication have advanced over thesame period of time. How would the first users of the telephone in the 1890srespond if presented with cellular smart phone technology from the 21st century?These are recent advancements in the grand scheme of time. Imagine thepossibilities of what our technology will look like in another hundred years orthousand years. Getting back to the topic at-hand, what amazing things couldexist created by an alien culture in advance of our own by one thousand years?Is it really that amazing to speculate on space travel by such a race? Afterall, in our short history, how many manned and unmanned space explorations wehave developed and deployed? If faced with visitors from outside our world potentially thousands of yearsin advance of our own, how would their technology appear to us? Our primitivescientists would pose logical arguments based on physics as we know it to denytheir existence, since they cannot explain it in conventional terms. What theycannot explain – they refute. Rather than embracing the phenomenon as truescientists and objectively investigating it, they dismiss the subject matter apriori. This is a situation that has plagued the subject of UFOs for decadeswith certain exceptions to this rule. There have been some courageous scientists who have delved into this subjectmatter – consequences be damned! Of course, there was Dr. J. Allen Hynek who wasthe Scientific Consultant to the U.S. Air Force’s Project Blue Book for manyyears until its termination in 1969. Others have included Dr. James E. McDonald,Dr. Jacques Vallee, and Dr. Peter Sturrock to name just a few. It is interesting to note that in the 1950s and1960s, ideas began to developwithin UFO circles that perhaps the UFOs do not come from some other planet, butperhaps some other dimension of reality. Mainstream scientists scoffed at theidea and used it to illustrate the folly of UFO researchers and their lunatictheories. However, with the passage of time, many of today’s scientists are notlaughing at the idea of multiple dimensions co-existing with our own. As sciencehas developed, so too have many scientists in their thinking and approachtowards UFOs. Some have acknowledged the possibilities of UFOs in relation tothe new physics such as string theory, wormholes, etc. A double-standard exists today regarding the idea of UFOs andextra-terrestrial life. Mainstream science embraces the idea that life may existelsewhere in the universe. In fact, that idea is the driving force currentlybehind many unmanned space missions. In addition, there are various SETI (Searchfor Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) programs currently active. These are basedon the premise that if there is life elsewhere in the universe, perhaps theyhave used radio waves or similar communication at one time or another. If so,then we can use radio telescopes to listen for these non-random electro-magneticpatterns against the general background noise of the universe. This concept iscertainly a valid and noble one. I personally encourage their efforts. However, whereas SETI projects are held in high regard and garner scientificrecognition; UFO research is relegated to the “fringe element.” SETI programs inone form or another have been active for decades going back to the 1960s. Yetthese programs have nothing to show for their efforts. No signals have yet beendetected that confirm intelligent life in the universe. I must emphasize, thisshould not be construed as a rationale for closure of such projects. Again, Isupport their continued endeavors with the hope of eventual success. Conversely, despite decades of valid case material, science and the media toa large extent have ignored or ridiculed the UFO subject matter and thoseassociated with it. This is ironic, considering at the core of it all, we areall striving for the same thing – confirmation of intelligent life beyond ourown. We share the dream if not the methodology. But there exists a rift betweenthese two groups that is predicated on the fundamental notion of whereextraterrestrial life exists. SETI groups operate under the notion that intelligent life could exist outthere in the universe, but they couldn’t possibly be visiting Earth. UFOresearchers concede that intelligent life could exist in the universe, but addthat it is also a distinct possibility those same intelligences could bemonitoring/visiting our planet given the age of the universe relative to that ofEarth’s. As previously discussed, extra-terrestrial life could exist and bethousands or millions of years ahead of us in technology. We simply cannotignore this possibility. I have worked in the medical field for fifteen years and have seen anever-growing trend towards multi-disciplinary approaches towards remedyingdisease states and illnesses. Rather than taking a one prong approach to curinga patient; physicians are looking at various treatment modalities to be done inconjunction with one another. Why can’t we utilize this same philosophyregarding the study of extra-terrestrial life? Why can’t we have SETI programsthat have public/private funding as well as UFO research that can be equallysupported? Why don’t we actively pursue both avenues of research and hold themin equally high regard? It is just a thought. Where we stand today in reference to triangular UFOs and the UFO subject as awhole is just a stepping stone in our examination of this phenomenon. Hopefully,this book serves a small role in gaining insights and understanding into themystery by focusing specifically on one particular subgroup of UFOs. Questionsremain as to the relationship, if any, of these triangular UFOs relative to theothers of varying description. Each person who reviews this material can maketheir own conclusions. However, at the very least, we must acknowledge thepossibility of a tangible reality behind this mystery. Using the field of archaeology as an analogy, the age of humankind on thisplanet continues to be dated earlier into antiquity as we discover new fossilevidence. The field of UFOlogy is no different. As new information comes to thesurface, we will need to examine the information with a critical eye anddetermine its validity. In addition, such information may force us to re-examinepreviously-held ideas and beliefs concerning the subject matter. Until hard UFO evidence is presented for the general public’s consumption(e.g., actual UFO or parts thereof), this mystery will continue. However, thethirst for understanding is there and will continue to fuel the investigationsand research until the day when a better understanding is made of this mostintriguing phenomenon. Perhaps one day we will have definitive answers. Chapter 12:Thoughts From Other Researchers I felt that a proper way to conclude our “estimate” was to have a number ofcredible UFO researchers share their insights into the triangular UFO mystery.Certainly, despite my years of experience and research in this field of inquiry,I do not have a firm understanding of what we are truly dealing with and look toothers for input and new perspectives. Like any field of scientific study, Ibelieve it must be a collaborative effort. To that end, I share the followingthoughts from some of my friends and colleagues: Richard M. Dolan, UFO Historian For decades, generations, and probably more, UFOs have constituted a greatunexplained phenomenon that even today we struggle to comprehend. Afteraccounting for the vagaries of human perception, the inevitablemisunderstandings that arise due to various natural phenomena, and all the otherfactors that may cause an honest human being to misinterpret an unusual event,we are left with a staggering number of genuine, unexplained things traversingthe skies, the oceans, and even Earth's orbit. It is not merely that these objects, assuming that is what they are, don'tfit into our standard political and technological history. Because they don't.But they also defy our current, albeit conventional, understanding of science. Isay conventional because there are several leading-edge, unconventionalscientific theories that may well explain the bulk of this phenomenon. Butwithout a doubt, a genuine understanding of UFOs promises to turn much of ourpreviously held collective reality on its head. Within this grand mystery, an important subset has arisen. This is thephenomenon of the triangles. It's not that there were no triangular UFOs beingrecorded during the early years – by early, I mean the immediate post-World WarII era. There were a few, but only a few. Amid the several UFO designs that werenoted even back then, triangles were simply one variation, something thatresearchers did not think too much about. Far more prevalent were thedisk-shaped objects. That is, the saucers. There was a definite increase in reports of triangular UFOs during the 1970s.Most significantly was a brief wave of well-observed triangles over in NorthCarolina in 1975. For the remainder of the decade, sporadic reports were madethroughout many regions of the United States. It may well be that mosttriangular UFOs happened to be in America, but we should remember that theUnited States had by far the best UFO reporting system at the time.Realistically, we will never know how many people saw such triangles back then,especially beyond American borders. It was during the early 1980s that the triangles -- and boomerang-shapedcraft -- became big news among UFO researchers. The objects were enormous,highly visible to thousands of witnesses, and, most amazing, were appearing justnorth of the New York City metropolitan area. So much for UFOs appearing only tohillbilly farmers who drink too much moonshine. Indeed, throughout the decade,perfectly triangular craft were being seen and recorded in many other places,most notably Pennsylvania, California, the American South, and the UnitedKingdom. The thing about perfectly triangular craft is quite simple: they are notsupposed to exist. Just like other forms of UFOs, these things do not officiallyexist within the fleet of any known civilian or military agency. Within the lastfew years, it is true that there have been a few drone aircraft that looktriangular in shape. But this is a very recent development, since around 2010 orso. And even so, none of the known drones are perfectly triangular. Also, just like other types of UFOs, these triangles are occasionallyobserved to perform maneuvers that defy explanation. How is it possible for ahovering craft instantly to accelerate rapidly away, and to do so silently? Thishas been observed a number of times. In fact, there have been several scientific attempts to explain suchpropulsion technologies, most notably by the late NASA scientist Paul Hill inhis classic work, Unconventional Flying Objects: A Scientific Analysis. Hillhypothesized that the UFOs so many people have observed use a form of gravitycancellation, the power source for which unfortunately he could not identify.Yet, the math seemed valid in that, with enough energy, an electrograviticeffect could explain most, if not all, of the performance capabilities of UFOs.There is no reason the triangles should be seen any differently in this respect. Certainly one of the most interesting questions concerning the triangles iswho is making them? Even though there are no known aircraft like them, somepeople have suspected them to be a secret American project. There is some evidence supporting this belief. In August 1989, a former RoyalObserver Corps member was working on a North Sea gas rig about sixty miles offthe Norfolk coast. This man, named Chris Gibson, was one of the world’s expertsin aircraft recognition. He even competed in international recognitiontournaments and was writing an aircraft recognition manual at the time of hissighting. What he saw that day was a matte black aircraft, shaped in a perfectisosceles triangle, with the nose angle at 30 degrees, in a refueling operationwith a KC-135. Two F-111 fighters accompanied the craft. The triangular craftwas slightly larger than an F-111. Aviation writer Bill Sweetman noted that “noaircraft other than a supersonic vehicle, or a test aircraft for such a vehicle,has ever been built or studied with such a planform.” As a result, some people attributed this sighting to the fabled Aurora, thealleged hypersonic successor to the world’s \"fastest\" plane, the SR-71Blackbird. Of course, the Aurora never flew, or even existed, officially, butthe rumor mill gave it dimensions that were compatible with what Gibson saw. But given that the Aurora, or something like it, ever existed, was thatreally what Gibson saw? And could that possibly have been the craft that buzzedBelgium in 1989-1990, or was responsible for the Hudson Valley sightings?Hardly. The craft observed in those places were seen to hover, accelerateinstantly, and (on one occasion recorded by the Belgian military) rapidly changealtitude. There are also rumors of the TR-3A and TR-3B, called the Black Manta.According to some claims, it is a tactical reconnaissance aircraft that wasfirst operational in the early 1990s, funded and tasked by the NRO, NSA, andCIA. Furthermore, it has been claimed that the TR-3B has something called aMagnetic Field Disruptor, which is a circular, highly pressurized, mercury-basedplasma filled ring surrounding a rotatable crew compartment. The plasma isaccelerated to extreme speeds, which is said to result in “gravity disruption,”and can neutralize the effect of gravity on mass by as much as 89 percent. Thus,it could have an indefinite loiter time at high altitudes, and the ability totravel as fast as Mach 9. Of course, all of this is alleged, none counts as evidence. Does the BlackManta really exist? Or is it all nothing more than hearsay? Is it possible thatthe black-budget world actually has such technology? Certainly, many doubts remain, but I do believe that the U.S. military hassome sort of flying triangle, perhaps several types. Even so, it is a long stretch to argue that all of the triangle reports canbe attributed to \"our\" technology. Frankly, many of these craft do not appear tocome from any conceivable terrestrial source. After all, how far back could we push the technology to account fortriangles? Could the Black Manta -- even assuming it exists -- have beenresponsible for the Belgian sightings of 1989 and 1990? And even if that wereso, what does one make of the Hudson Valley sightings, which are earlier still?And the earlier reports still, many of which are recounted by David Marler'sresearch. At what point do we move from the improbable, to the implausible, tothe ridiculous? No matter what the ultimate answer is behind the mystery of the triangles, tosay nothing of the greater mystery of UFOs, it is easy to see why the subject ismarked by such silence and obfuscation from our political leadership. For thisis an explosive issue, and the opening of this door will inevitably lead to evermore questions being asked, ever more doors opening. Mark Rodeghier, Scientific Director, Center for UFO Studies UFOs have been reported with a myriad of shapes, including ones that makeabsolutely no aerodynamic sense, such as a rectangular box, or flying pyramids.This proliferation of shapes has been a continuing puzzle, and although humanerror undoubtedly contributes to some uncertainty in specific instances, thegeneral point that UFOs are far from standardized is certainly correct. Among the more common forms, triangular- or boomerang-shaped UFOs have been acategory that has long had a potential connection with terrestrial technology,however unlikely. We know that the Nazis in World War II were activelydeveloping triangular aircraft, specifically the fabled Horten brothers flyingwing. And after the war, with that aircraft as design inspiration, the NorthropCorporation developed the YB-49, an American version of the flying wing. Thisaircraft actually flew, albeit with various technical difficulties, and so neverwent into full production. Unlike flying wing designs, the disk-shaped UFO, which was the most commonuntil the 1980s, has never had any serious competition among manmade aircraft.The most ‘advanced’ design was the Avro VZ-9 Avrocar, developed in Canada, whichdefinitely looked like a classic flying saucer. But in contrast to the reportedflight capabilities of UFOs, the Avrocar was barely able to lift off the ground,and never was a serious flying machine. In later years, the US Air Force developed the F-117 Stealth Fighter and theB-2 Stealth Bomber, both descendants of the flying wing designs, in spirit ifnot in technical details. And these aircraft are very capable, if not able tomatch the maneuvers reported in some UFO sightings. What this history has meant for reports of triangular UFOs is that it hasbeen just possible to believe that some of these reports, especially in morerecent years, are caused by hi-tech, very secret, technology developed on Earth.The same has simply not been true for other UFO shapes. As David Marler demonstrates in this volume, there were plenty of sightingsof triangular UFOs in the early modern era of UFO reports, say until about 1980.And investigators looked into these and generally treated them no differentlythan other sightings. The fact that we had once developed a flying wing didn’tmean that these sightings were, if hard to explain otherwise, attributed toterrestrial technology. But among the many UFO shapes reported, triangular UFOswere low in frequency, so no special emphasis was placed on these reports. All of this changed in the early 1980s, as UFOs that were boomerang ortriangular began to take center stage in the UFO mystery, while disk-shaped UFOsbecame scarcer. And this wasn’t something very gradual and stealthy; instead, itburst on the scene dramatically near New York City with the famous series ofincidents now known as the Westchester boomerang. I was privy early on to this,as Dr. J. Allen Hynek, scientific director of CUFOS at the time, did his owninvestigation along with local ufologist Philip Imbrogno. When Dr. Hynek reported his findings to us, we found them rather incredible,even coming from such a respected colleague, and our attitude had nothing towith the triangular shape. It was, instead, their very large size, slow motion,low altitude, and lengthy time in view, and the many witnesses, which caused usto be skeptical. Those types of behavior were rare in combination in the mass ofUFO sightings, no matter the UFO shape, and so we looked for some alternativehypothesis (including, yes, classified technology). Of course, it didn’t taketoo long for the evidence to become convincing, and to see that what was goingon in Westchester county and nearby was something new in UFO history. What we didn’t realize at the time was that these events announced a changein the long-run course of sightings, as triangle UFOs gradually came to bedominant among those UFOs with some reported structure (although lights at nightwith no obvious associated object have been, and still are, the most common typeof UFO reported). The change wasn’t limited to a UFO’s appearance, but includedthose same features that first appeared in the Westchester reports. TriangleUFOs usually didn’t speed away to end a sighting, but often majestically movedslowly into the distance. They lingered, giving witnesses a good view, and oftena relatively nearby view, as they were reported at low altitudes. Triangle UFOs were hardly ever reported to land, and so couldn’t leave markson the ground or cause other physical effects. Nor did they interfere with theoperation of vehicles, as disk-shaped and other UFOs did and—very rarely—stilldo. And triangle UFOs came in very large sizes, often hundreds of feet across(the size I calculated after speaking to witnesses of the Tinley Park trianglesighting in Illinois in 2005). As we compared triangle UFOs to the triangle- and boomerang-shaped aircraftdeveloped by the military, it became clear that the vast majority of triangleUFOs were not caused by conventional, or unconventional, technology. I discussedthis with aviation experts and aviation journalists, and they were uniformlyunaware of any terrestrial aircraft that could be causing these reports. So are triangle UFOs the central element of the UFO phenomenon today? Well,not quite, but they do illustrate quite well the continuing scientific enigmaposed by UFO sightings. Why don’t witnesses report disk-shaped UFOs so muchtoday? Why have they essentially been replaced by triangle- and boomerang-shapedUFOs? Why do triangle UFOs often engage in behavior so different than UFOsreported in the early modern era of UFO sightings, such as appearing openly inpopulous areas? It is hard to imagine that something in the makeup of UFO witnesses orsociety has caused this evolution, since it has happened throughout the Westernworld, whether it is the US, Canada, the UK, or France. The UFO phenomenon haschanged (and in many other ways which cannot be detailed in this essay), and wedidn’t expect it (not that we had any great track record in predicting theregularity of UFO waves, or UFO hotspots, or hardly any other characteristic ofthe phenomenon). And that change is exemplified by the rise of sightings oftriangle UFOs. Finally, the large, slow triangle UFOs, viewed by hundreds, even thousands,demonstrate how willfully the establishment, represented by government,academics, and the elite news media, can disregard something that is soubiquitous, so visible, and so unearthly. It is possible not to see the elephantin the room, even when that elephant is a 300-foot triangular-shaped UFO. George Wingfield, UFO and Crop Circle Researcher, UKSome Thoughts on the Flying Triangle UFOs “Whatever this was, it definitely wasn’t anything from here. It was not anycraft from this Earth.” That is what has often been said about the flyingtriangle UFOs by witnesses in the US, in Belgium, and in other countries wherethese things have been seen during the last sixty years or so. Even so, one hasto ask whether such judgments are justifiable. There is certainly little dispute that what witnesses see is not any kind ofnatural phenomenon and these objects or craft do appear to be intelligentlycontrolled. If that’s accepted, then the only remaining dispute there can be iswhether this control is of human or non-human origin. Conspiracy theorists will undoubtedly suggest that the triangles must beblack project aircraft commissioned by the US government that might includeLEMVs (Long Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicles which are giant hybridmilitary airships) or maybe ultrasonic successors to the SR-71 such as thealleged “Aurora.” They also suggest there may be secret aircraft which employ“electrogravitics,” “gravity shielding,” or technologies which allow“masslessness” --although these concepts are more in the realm of sciencefiction rather than science fact. LEMVs are certainly being tested now and we’llsee a lot more of them, but they are new and could not possibly be anexplanation for the triangles which have been seen widely since the 1980s andindeed long before. Careful examination of the history of known black project aircraft such asthe SR-71, the F-117 Stealth attack aircraft, or the B-2 Stealth bomber whichwere all eventually declassified gives one no reason to believe that these couldever have been mistaken for the flying triangle UFOs. Nor is it feasible thatany black project aircraft that are not yet declassified could possibly accountfor all the triangles that have been seen during the last fifty years. There isabsolutely no proof either that secret “electrogravitic” or “massless” aircrafthave ever flown or that such technologies even exist. The notion of gravityshielding is equally improbable since gravity, according to General Relativitytheory, is really a property of space and time and not some force that can beshielded against. If these UFOs are not of human origin one then has to ask: “Is there any wayof knowing what they really are?” Any supposition that they might be ofextraterrestrial origin should not be colored by preconceived notions we mighthave regarding UFOs and their supposed alien occupants. There have been so manyfalse claims of alien contact over the past sixty-odd years and the emergence ofa UFO mythology that promotes the existence of small gray aliens (plus severalother varieties) that we would be unwise to make any such assumptions if we areever to get at the truth. Without saying that all such UFO lore is necessarilyfallacious and all claims of alien contact false, we still need to ask severalbasic questions which do not necessarily have easy answers. My first question is whether these UFOs are necessarily “craft,” “vehicles,”or, indeed, “spaceships”? Maybe they are, but equally they may have somecompletely different function. “Craft” or “vehicles” imply that they are used tomove occupants (or whatever) from A to B. This question of what these UFOsreally are must always be borne in mind. Secondly, are such UFOs “piloted,” occupied by “aliens”/”non-humans,” or a“crew,” etc? Not necessarily so, as might well have been supposed until quiterecent times. These days a large proportion of the US military’s aircraftinventory consists of UAVs –drones-- flown using artificial intelligence or,usually, remotely controlled. The same considerations could well apply to UFOs,if they are of non-human origin, and their purpose could also be surveying, orreconnaissance, like that of manmade drones. The third question we need to ask is whether flying triangle UFOs are realsolid objects, whether they are of metallic or other construction, and whetherthey have any significant mass? Let us return to this question separately. The fourth question is whether these UFOs move through the atmosphere in anaerodynamic manner like aircraft and whether, if they were to crash, they wouldleave wreckage or fragments behind on earth? The answer to the first part ofthis question appears, from witness accounts, to be that they do not –they donot fly aerodynamically-- and, for the second part, one can only say there is noconfirmed record of any material piece of a UFO ever being left behind orrecovered. My fifth and last question is whether the hypothesized intelligence thatcontrols such flying triangle UFOs is either benign or hostile towards humans?Or, indeed, whether they have any particular interest in humans whatever? Some of these questions will not necessarily have any obvious answers butnevertheless they need to be asked. It is important that the above are validquestions and that we do not jump to unwarranted conclusions. Yet furtherunanswered questions may arise as we seek understanding. The reported flight characteristics of the flying triangles certainly do notappear to be aerodynamic like those of an airplane and seem only consistent withtheir having a very small mass or possibly no mass at all. Their silent flight,which appears to produce no displacement of air as even a glider would, andtheir sometimes reported huge acceleration to extreme speed gives further reasonto think that their mass, if any, must be vanishingly small. What does this sayabout the material the UFOs may consist of? There are two ways of looking at this. One speculative approach could be thatthe triangles consist of an unknown material of very small or possibly near-zerodensity like, say, neutrinos, billions of which --scientists assure us--constantly pour through space and through everything, including us, in theuniverse. The supposition that objects like the triangles could consist of anunknown material like this and be able to pass through normal physical thingsmight be feasible if something akin to teleportation were involved, but in termsof our present science that is still in the realm of science fiction. Howeverscientists do speculate that travel through space and time might one day bepossible if mass is somehow converted into energy in a non-destructive way thatallows its reconstitution when it reaches its destination. Do the flyingtriangle UFOs have such capability, perhaps allowing them to travelinterdimensionally as pure energy? The other possibility that would explain the apparent masslessness of theflying triangles is that what witnesses see is really just a moving image.Although this explanation seems counterintuitive, there is some reason tobelieve that these apparently vast UFOs have no more substance than the movingimage of, say, an airplane --or, perhaps, the image of the Starship Enterprise--on the screen of a movie theater. If true, it would explain how such UFOs cantravel very slowly, seemingly unaffected by gravity, shoot off at unimaginablespeeds, or perhaps simply vanish in situ, change their shape or lightconfiguration, or indeed behave in a variety of other mysterious ways. It mightalso explain why such UFOs are rarely seen except at night. I say “counterintuitive” because whenever one sees a large shape or maybe acluster of lights in the sky one immediately assumes that it is an airplane orairship or some aerial vehicle. With the flying triangle UFOs, observers assumethat it is a craft although most often no fuselage is actually seen and that isonly inferred from the fact the lights appear to move in unison, as if part ofone object. With some triangle UFO sightings, such as the Phoenix Lights ofMarch 1997, the inference of some observers was that this was some enormouscraft perhaps a mile or more across. The alternative explanation is that thiscould have been a number of bright lights –say, UFOs—moving in unison. Or,indeed, a number of moving images that appear to move together like a singleobject. The “moving image” suggestion does however beg several further questions. Whoor what could be producing such moving images? What or where is the origin ofsuch images? Who or what is the, if any, intended “audience”? If moving imagesare what is seen, are these images of real objects somewhere else, or are theyabstract images? And, if these UFOs are just images, what conceivably could betheir purpose? In the past one might have supposed any such image would need to be projectedfrom some point of origin on to a surface like a cinema screen. In today’s worldone has to acknowledge there are many other ways of producing video images, someof which --like holograms-- require no screen. Other images may originate fromdistant sources as with the internet. These days many are familiar with 3-Dimages that can cause one to duck and we are told of computer-generated “virtualrealities” that are 90% similar to reality itself. Can we be sure that theflying triangle UFOs are material objects rather than moving images produced asa virtual reality? Of course, some triangle UFOs, at least, must be materialobjects since there have been radar returns from them, such as during theBelgium triangle UFO flap. Equally images projected from inside a translucentsphere onto its surface could give any such object different appearances orlight configurations. If the flying triangle UFOs are primarily moving images without materiality,does that mean they are necessarily of human origin? There is no indication thatthat is so. The reverse seems more likely to be the case and there are reasonsfor believing that the source of such images –if the triangles are indeedexplained as moving images— may be some non-human intelligence, or at least anintelligence which has its origin far removed from us in space or time. What itspurpose might be, or whether that purpose is due to an interest in the humanrace, is a far harder question to answer. It is certainly tempting to think thatthese UFOs might be some kind of non-material ET drone that allows surveillanceof this planet by unknown intelligences far, far away. That speculation bringsus sharply back to the conclusions of those triangle UFO witnesses that westarted with: that this “thing” was otherworldly, and quite definitely notsomething from here... Omar Fowler (Phenomenon Research Association) Derby, EnglandThe Flying Triangle Mystery in the UK We had followed the early appearance of ‘Flying Triangles’ (also referred toas ‘FTs’) when they appeared in the Hudson Valley during the early months of1983. It soon became apparent that these mysterious craft were no longer confinedto a particular area of the United States, but were beginning to spread out in apattern that resulted in sightings being reported in all the major countries ofthe world. During the period 1989/90 it was the turn of Belgium to be inundated withnightly visits from these huge black and silent craft. This became the firstinstance where fighter aircraft were directed to intercept these craft andalthough the F16 fighters of the Belgian Air Force were unable to match theamazing manoeuvres of the ‘FT’s’, they did succeed in obtaining radar scopefootage showing the astounding performance of the ‘FT’ craft. On the night of the 26th September 1993 a huge black ‘Flying Triangle’ flewslowly across the Derbyshire town of Bakewell, setting the scene for what was tocome! (The PRA were able to interview a primary witness on video within 45minutes of the event). The witness confirmed that he had been driving andapproaching the town, when he saw the low level lights slowly gliding in frontof him. He accelerated to 40 mph and not only caught up with the illuminatedFlying Triangle, but he overtook it! The ‘Flying Triangle’ sightings continued in a sporadic fashion in the ‘eastMidlands’ area of the UK until December 1994, when the ‘FT’s’ arrived in force! During the period December 1994 to May 1995, fifty two ‘Flying Triangle’events were investigated in the Derbyshire area. In some instances ‘FT’s’hovered low over traffic and individual vehicles. In one case, a terrified womanpassenger tried to hide under the glove compartment of the car as a FlyingTriangle flew low overhead (more than one male driver departed the scene at highspeed!) There were a number of incidents where an interaction had taken place betweena witness and a ‘Flying Triangle’ that indicated that these were not the productof some mysterious military power but had all the indications that these craftwere alien to our civilization. In one instance a late night driver was passing near the Rolls-Royce AeroEngine Test Bed facility near Sinfin in Derby, when he had an unexpectedencounter with a Flying Triangle. The time was 1.20am as the witness was driving along the deserted road nearthe engine works. Then suddenly his headlights went out and almost at the sametime, he noticed a series of lights hovering over a nearby field. He pulled upto a stop and peered out through his window and was able to see three whitelights hovering over a nearby power line pylon. He was able to make out what appeared to be a triangle of lights and close tothe ‘nose’ he noticed a bright red light which was positioned next to a brightwhite light. As he peered out through his side window and into the darkness hewas able to make out the classic shape of a Flying Triangle. As he watched the FT, it slowly started to move away and soon it was out ofsight. Then suddenly his van headlights came on again and the Flying Trianglehad gone! There were numerous witness reports describing how these huge 'FT's' had beenobserved moving slowly and silently as they approached the witness and thenpassing silently overhead. There had been various reactions from witnesses and any animals that happenedto be in the vicinity. One mother described how she had seen the FT slowlyapproaching and her six year old daughter asked what it was. \"It was anaeroplane\" replied the mother, the young girl replied \"I don't like thataeroplane Mummy!\" The mother also felt uneasy and quickly walked away from thearea. There was also animal reaction the Flying Triangles, one witness out walkingwith his dogs described how the dogs had become very excited. On the 22nd ofFebruary 1995 another witness Mr 'R C' had just returned to his home in Derbywhen he observed two FT's with numerous lights. They were stationary at first,but then began to move towards the witness. He heard a 'humming noise' as thetwo FT's passed overhead and he noticed that his dogs were nervous. An even more disturbing case was that of a young girl that lived in a smallvillage out in the countryside of North Yorkshire. The incident took place onthe 3rd July 1996 when the young lady, having finished work for the day haddecided to have a quiet walk in the nearby countryside, find a pleasant spot tosit in the sunshine and to read a book. Within a short time, she had nestleddown on the grass at the side of a field and began to read her book. It wasseveral minutes later that her attention was drawn to a dark shadow slowlycrossing the field and coming in her direction. She looked up to see a hugeblack triangular craft, then suddenly a shaft of blue light shot down from thecraft and covered her and she felt herself going upwards very, very fast and shefelt sick. She went on to describe remembering lying on a table and surrounded by'Grays', with one taller alien about 6 feet tall, that seemed to be in charge ofthings. He peered into her eyes and she began to feel peaceful. Then her memoryfaded and the next thing she knew was when she woke up in the field she had beenin, but in a different position in the field. She looked around and eventuallyfound her book in the hedge and proceeded to walk home. \"When I got home 5 1/2 hours had elapsed and I went in (I have five dogs),the dogs reacted strangely to me. Instead of coming up and jumping all over me,like they normally did, they were like whimpering and cowering away and sniffingall the way around me. I have had awful headaches and nosebleeds. I thought itwas some kind of dream, but I've kept having really bad flashbacks!\" These few examples that I have given are just the tip of the Flying Triangleiceberg and I am sure that although the 'Military' may have developed a stealthtriangular craft, the examples that I have given indicate that we have been andstill are regularly visited by aliens from another dimension! I am sure that David will review all the information that he has availableand will produce a technical publication of outstanding interest. Peter Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting Center Following the June 24th, 1947, sighting by Mr. Ken Arnold of a string ofbizarre-looking objects, seen streaking, almost nose-to-tail, down the crest ofthe Cascade Mountains in Washington State, for many people, the term “flyingsaucer” suddenly became synonymous with the concept of an extraterrestrial spacecraft. This bit of UFO history is ironic given that the multiple objects seen onthat date were not saucer-shaped at all, but rather more scimitar-like orwedge-shaped in their appearance, according to the witness’s description. Ken Arnold’s sighting was first reported by a Portland, Oregon newspaper. Thereporter labeling the objects “saucers,” a term which has endured now for oversix decades, and which, early in the discussion of UFOs, tacitly misled manypeople to believe that all UFOs were disk-shaped. Had the journalist reportedmore accurately what the witness had observed that day, we ufologists might betalking today not about “flying saucers,” but rather about “flying triangles.” In preparing to write this piece, I reviewed the database of over 87,000sighting reports collected by the National UFO Reporting Center since 1994. WhatI observed was eye-opening and it lends strong support to David Marler’sground-breaking thesis regarding the importance of studying triangular-shapedUFOs. Whereas “disks,” are reported in 6,460 of those cases, “chevrons,”“diamonds,” “boomerangs,” and “triangles” are reported in at least 11,000 casessuggesting that triangular UFOs may be significantly more common than disks.This is a fact that probably has not been openly recognized before DavidMarler’s book on this important subject. Some skeptics take the position that these triangular craft are nothing morethan modern, delta-winged aircraft of terrestrial origin. However, even amoment’s consideration of that possibility compels a reasonable person to rejectit immediately and merely out of hand. First, triangular UFOs have been reported by reliable witnesses since longbefore aeronautical engineers ever recognized the value of the swept-wing designconcept. The National UFO Reporting Center has at least one credible report onfile of a distinctly triangular-shaped craft, witnessed by two teenage CivilianConservation Corps workers, one Saturday night in Eklutna, Alaska, duringOctober 1936 (as referenced in Chapter 3). Obviously, the sighting occurred longbefore aircraft designers began to address the aerodynamic benefits of“sweeping” the wings of a high-speed aircraft. In addition, over recent decades, we have collected countless reports oftriangles allegedly seen by credible witnesses to hover while motionless andsilent. A small number of highly specialized terrestrial aircraft may be able tohover for short periods of time, but with the exception of blimps anddirigibles, they certainly are not capable of doing so silently. Anyone who hasbeen witness to a display by an AV-8B “Harrier,” the so-called “jump jet,” knowshow loud those aircraft are when they are in a hovering mode! Another characteristic of triangular UFOs which rules out their beingterrestrial craft, is the light patterns they are often reported by witnesses todisplay at night. To be consistent with the Federal Aviation Regulations(“FAR’s”) pertaining to aircraft lighting, the only colored lights that aterrestrial aircraft may display legally at night are red, green, and white.Triangular UFOs are often reported to display for example blue and orange lightsin addition to other varying colors, which would have the craft in violation ofthose regulations and which would subject the aircraft operator to possibleprosecution. Moreover, the positioning of the lights on triangular UFOs, asoften reported by witnesses, is altogether inconsistent with other federallymandated lighting requirements. Many other characteristics of these triangular UFOs are breath-taking byterrestrial standards and they are altogether incompatible with the performancecapabilities of aerodynamically controlled vehicles of human manufacture. Theirability to suddenly accelerate and streak out of sight within seconds is vastlyin excess of performance capabilities of any aircraft of terrestrial origin ordesign. Examples of such breath-taking performance were witnessed in thecelebrated sighting over St. Clair County, Illinois, on January 5th, 2000 (asdiscussed in Chapter 1), and again in the sighting near Stephenville, Texas, onJanuary 08th, 2008. In the former case, a seasoned police officer reported thatthe gigantic triangle above his police cruiser suddenly accelerated and “jumped”many miles, an assertion that was later corroborated by subsequent investigationmuch of that corroboration having been provided by Mr. Marler himself. In the case of the Stephenville sighting, a triangular craft was seen bycountless witnesses on the ground to suddenly accelerate and quickly outdistancethe two USAF F-16 fighters which clearly were in pursuit of it. The incidentoccurred not far from the ranch where President Bush was in residence at thetime. Finally, there is the issue of size. In many cases, ufologists have been ableto determine the distance from an eyewitness to an observed craft, which allowsan approximate determination of its actual dimensions. In the case of the“Phoenix Lights” sightings of March 13, 1997, in Arizona, for example, the huge,bizarre-looking chevron-shaped object that hovered motionless for an estimatedfive minutes above the home of Mrs. Sue Watson was not less than 8,000 feetabove the ground level. This altitude was calculated in a report made by the U.S. Air Force F-15 pilot who apparently had attempted to intercept the object.Given that the object subtended an arc of approximately 135 degrees, as viewedby witnesses on the ground, and by applying trigonometric analysis, the wingspanof the object could therefore be calculated. Those results suggest that thetriangular craft was not less than seven (statute) miles in width, from wingtipto wingtip, and it may have been as wide as 9 miles, if its altitude was as highas first reported by the pilot!! This was a craft that was seen to hover; tomove at supersonic velocity; and to accelerate at an unimaginable rapid rate asit suddenly moved off to the south from Sue Watson’s home. It is worth mentioning that this calculated wingspan is consistent with whatmany other witnesses reported that included Arizona Governor, Fife Symington.The USAF pilot who intercepted the triangle over the Watsons’ home, upon landinghis F-15c fighter back at Luke AFB minutes after the intercept, reported to hisground crew that the object was so large that it had filled 180 degrees of thewindshield and canopy of his aircraft…from his “9 o’clock” position, to his “3o’clock” position…in the horizontal plane! In support of these reports about the immense size of the Phoenix UFO, Mrs.Stacey Roads along with her husband, and their two children, reported drivingthat night under a huge triangular craft that “blanketed” Interstate 10. Thisoccurred as they drove toward Phoenix, and they stated how it literally “filledthe sky” above their heads! In her written report, she emphasized how immensethe craft was and how much of the sky it concealed from their view. What explains the shape of these triangular UFOs, we can only guess. Until weare able to communicate with the presumed occupants of those craft, we can onlybut conjecture on what determines the shape of the triangular craft and, infact, all other types of UFOs (e.g., disks and spheres). Could the shape be theresult of the special conditions required of space travel? Could it be theresult of aerodynamic considerations, given that UFOs apparently must be capableof navigating in both space and atmospheric conditions? Could it be the resultof the design requirements dictated by the craft’s propulsion system or becauseof the requirements of the laws of physics, about which we yet know nothing?These are all questions for which ufologists have no answers, but which DavidMarler’s book addresses, and to which, at long last, it opens the doors ofinquiry. David Marler’s focus on triangular-shaped UFOs is long overdue inufology, and it finally serves to correct the long-standing misconception aboutwhat UFOs are - or can be. The book opens a new chapter in an important arena ofthe continuing mystery of ufology, and I anticipate that it will set the“high-water” mark in UFO research on this subject for many decades to come.
