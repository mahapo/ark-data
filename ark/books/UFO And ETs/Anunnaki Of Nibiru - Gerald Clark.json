Innumerable television specials on the archeological findings relatingto the Egyptian pyramids, the Mayan calendar, and discoveries of books andrecords from around the world uncovered in various forms, to include SumerianCuneiform tablets, provides modern man with a new understanding of ancienthistory. This lost knowledge has been slow to make its way into mainstreamthought and is just now beginning to air on television on the History andDiscovery Channels. It took time for archeologists to find the right artifactsto decode the past languages from the region.Many historical and scriptural findings that were not included in ormisrepresented by the Canonical Bible have now come to light. Access to scriptssuch as the Book of Enoch, the Nag Hamadi Gospels, the Book of Jubilees, amongother historical texts, when synthesized and correlated with existing documents,is truly an eye opener relative to the common beliefs found in the modernWestern culture.Ancient Writings other than the books of the Canonical Bible broaden ourknowledge base relative to history in the Middle East. Hidden scrolls tuckedaway in remote caves, cuneiform tablets covered by the sands of time, andequinox and solstice temples aligned perfectly to the sun lay forgotten in thedeserted plains of Mesopotamia. Many of the documents predate the CanonicalBible by thousands of years, shedding light on the origins and influences of thefamiliar stories told therein having an immense influence on Western thought. Would it surprise the reader to know that the flood hero Noah was actually aSumerian King in the city of Shuruppak? He was quite well educated and wrote anaccount of his own regarding the times in which he lived. In the epic ofGilgamesh, one of the longest known stories involving the King of the Sumeriancity of Uruk, the King visits Noah and has a long conversation with him aboutsome issues common to both of them. Also from Sumer, that is the Southernextreme of Mesopotamia—the land between the two rivers: the Tigris andEuphrates, hails the Biblical Patriarch Abraham. Abram became Abraham once thecovenant is made between him and the Lord, prior to that he was called Abram. Recall in Genesis 12:1-4 where The Lord said to Abram, Genesis 12:1-4 (NIV)“Leave your country, your people and your father’s householdand go to the land I will show you.I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you.I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.I will bless those that bless you and whoever curses you I will curse;and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.”Abram was in the Sumerian city of Haran when he received the call from the Lordto go to the land of Canaan. Note that Abram was born in the Sumerian city ofUr approximately 1433 BCE. His father, Terah, was an artisan and priest in thelocal temple, and his brothers Nahor and Haran resided in Ur as well [40]. Wefind Abraham in the city of Haran when he is preparing to leave for Canaan asstated in Genesis 15:7. Genesis 15:7 (NIV)“I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeansto give you this land to take possession of it. Wasn’t the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob the God of the Israelites, the Godof the Old Testament? Thus, in addition to names like Jehovah, Yahweh, and ElSheddai, Abraham’s God had another name in Sumer, one which he was called in oneof his Temples in the city of Ur.According to Cuneiform tablets found in Ur and many other pre and post-dilluvialcities along the Tigris and Euphrates to include Sippar and Nineveh, thisSumerian deity also had brothers and sisters who were also worshipped as gods inMesopotamia and the surrounding regions. Abraham’s deity’s name is mentioned inother noteworthy documents from the region and era to include the Atrahasis, theEnuma Elish, and the Epic of Gilgamesh. Abraham and Noah also have closecontact with these deities. Who were they and how do we know they existed? What are we to think about the fact that Abraham’s God had a previous history asa Sumerian deity with a temple dedicated to him in Ur of the Chaldeans? The funding for early archeological inquiries was closely controlled andchanneled by early church authorities, in particular the Roman Catholic Church. A mandate was issued to only fund the archeological explorations thatperpetuated the story told in the canonical Bible, established by the sameinstitution at the Council of Nicaea, 325 AD. Eventually, hidden books andsuppressed artifacts, codices, cylinder seals, and Sumerian cuneiform inscribedmonuments and tablets gave up their secrets to the inquisitive minds ofdisenfranchised seekers of truth.A heroic gentleman comes to mind, discovered during the research into this book,a Sir Henry Rawlinson , responsible for recording and decoding three languageshe discovered in 1835 located 1700 feet above the desert floor chiseled into thecliffs of Behistun, in modern day Iran. The historical marker was commissionedby Darius the 1st who lived and reigned from 522-486 BCE, recounting the Persianruler’s suppression of various rival uprisings. In 1835, Sir Henry Rawlinson, aBritish army officer training the army of the Shah of Iran, began studying theinscription in earnest. As the town of Bisistun's name was anglicized as\"Behistun\" at this time, the monument became known as the \"BehistunInscription\". Despite its inaccessibility, Rawlinson was able to scale the cliffand copy the Old Persian inscription. The Elamite was across a chasm, and theBabylonian four metres above; both were beyond easy reach and were left forlater.Armed with the Persian text, and with about a third of the syllabary madeavailable to him by the work of Grotefend, Rawlinson set to work on decipheringthe text. Fortunately, the first section of this text contained a list ofPersian kings identical to that found in Herodotus, and by matching the namesand the characters, Rawlinson was able to crack the form of cuneiform used forOld Persian by 1838 and present his results to the Royal Asiatic Society inLondon and the Societe Asiatique in Paris [120].Major Rawlinson copied the strange wedge-shaped writings etched into the sheerrock face and made them available to the British Museum after spending timedecoding the tablets. His efforts lead to the ability to translate Old Persian,Elamite, and Akkadian scripts from one to the other leading to the re-discoveryof the Mesopotamian sites in modern day Iraq, buried beneath the desert sands. A new investigation of the first-hand writings and evidence left by theEgyptians, Sumerians, and early church authors sheds new light on the historicaltruth, which at times seems stranger than the wildest contrived fictionaltales. Discoveries at the ancient Mesopotamian cities of Nineveh all the way tothe very Southern city of Eridu have many secrets to reveal, many of which arediscussed in this book.Various clues have surfaced and been laid bare for all to see, wrought forth bythe dedication, sweat, and blood of the investigative pioneers from the past. It is now the responsibility for modern man to take a fresh look at the originalevidence from which historians and scribes of the past aggregated the genesisaccounts upon which our society’s civilization foundations rest. Knowing thathistory’s texts are inked by those in power at the time events are recorded,often relegates truth to the sidelines in favor of a story that perpetuates thecontrolling influences of the ruling party. Flagrant acts such as chipping awayhieroglyphic evidence captured in stone to subsuming names and ranks of rivaldeities and creating also known as lists adds confusion to further cloud thetruth. Thus, given the unreliable nature of historical accuracy, people relegated theresponsibility of knowing the truth to authorities appointed over them. Thishappened readily for those unfortunate enough to not be able to read-whichthroughout history included the majority. Scribes and priests were often thosetrained in the lingual arts and thus had their fingers on the pulse of truththroughout history. Books written by first-hand authors that told the truth,such as the Book of Enoch, were hidden from mankind for thousands of years andare now widely in circulation. Tens of thousands of Cuneiform inscribed tabletsthat lay forgotten; buried for thousands of years guarding recorded secretshidden beneath the silt and sand of the Mesopotamian plains, recently unearthedall along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, have been recovered and decoded byarcheologists. So many tablets, tens of thousands, written in baked clay wererecovered that the discovery spawned a cuneiform digitization project toexpedite the process of garnering the tablet’s secrets [63]. Many of theSumerian artifacts and cuneiform tablets are on display in prominent museums inLondon, Paris, and Berlin to name just a few. The oldest Sumerian records pre-date the books of the canonical Bible bythousands of years in some cases. The Sumerian records, discovered in citieslike Uruk, the Biblical Erech, record mundane activities involving marriage andtrade, and more important accounts of decrees and records of birth and death,etc. Referencing the first-hand historical accounts versus those composed bythe societal victors, allows one to at least compare the current basis forcultural events and social mores with their antecedent counterparts frommultiple recorded cultural perspectives toward a synthesized whole. Stranger than fiction was the account of Noah’s mystifying near-alien birth asdescribed in vivid detail in the Book of Enoch [36]. According to some sources,Noah’s father was definitely not Lamech as told in Genesis 5: 28, but rather oneof the Mesopotamian deities that ends up saving him from the deluge [37]. Theold Babylonian version of the flood account depicts the deity speaking to a reedhut where Ziusudra, AKA Noah, resides thereby divulging the urgent warning toget prepared for a flood that was to arrive on the Mesopotamian plains. Thissame story is told in the Bible sans illuminating Sumerian detail.By analyzing the various birth accounts, genealogy tables, and deities veneratedin the temples of Mesopotamia, an interesting realization, actually a profoundepiphany is revealed! A cultural lie is uncovered that has such profound impactas to relegate all previous beliefs to obscurity, as if one had not come to thatconclusion already given our present-day knowledge base. When asking aWesterner the simple question, who was Yahweh? one gets the typical AKA list toinclude Jehovah and finally the AKA list ends with the answer of God, as taughtintentionally with the help of the canonical Bible, in particular the OldTestament. When one realizes that one of the Gods of the Old Testament, Yahweh,was none other than the local deity of the Sumerian city of Ur, e.g. Enlil, thetruth is revealed. For you see, Enlil was written about in a plethora ofaccounts in Sumeria and elsewhere in the region. Enlil and his relatives werevenerated as gods in various temples from Nineveh to Assur to the Sumerian cityof Ur to name just a few. Similarly his brother Enki and his children Nannarand Inanna also had temples in prominent cultural and trade portals within theregion. More importantly, Enlil was not acting alone, but rather in consortwith others referred to as the Anunnaki in the Atrahasis or the Nephilim orElohim in the Genesis 1:26 account wherein the confusing statement is made: Genesis 1:26 (NIV)Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, in our likeness…” The confusion created by the plural statement “us, our” in the Biblical creationaccount is clarified when reading texts that predate the Genesis account by morethan 1700 years such as the Atrahasis. Atrahasis, AKA the Biblical Noah, tellsthe story of the creation of man linking the same deities venerated in thetemples of Mesopotamia with Enlil-Yahweh of the old testament and his brotherEnki-Adonai: the hidden “us” in Genesis 1:26. For Enki is mentioned along withhis half-sister Ninmah, participating in genetic trials to produce a primitiveworker, Homo Sapiens Sapiens. A very detailed account is provided of a clinical trial that results in thearchetype for the human race Adam being birthed. The trial was conducted byEnlil’s half-sister, Ninharsag or Ninmah, and his archrival andscientifically-inclined brother Enki, in an African laboratory. The historicalrecords appeal to even the most scrutinizing scientist who recognizes readilythe threshold of knowledge required to discuss a topic such as geneticengineering, in a document almost five thousand years old, which provides a moredetailed account of the creation of man; one that makes sense technically andhistorically versus the précis version provided in the Bible, although in manycases complementary. Additionally, similar records illuminate the life of KingUt-napishtim of Shuruppak, the Biblical Noah, said to be 600 years old at thetime of the great flood. It seemed that various deities had also known as (AKA) names whichseemed to span long periods of time. The great god Sin, as named by theAkkadians, after whom the Sinai peninsula was named, had an AKA name linking himto various Sumerian cities such as Ur and Harran: where he was known as Nannarthe moon god, son of Enlil. His sister, Inanna also sported the symbol of thecrescent moon and had temples throughout Mesopotamia. She was known as Ishtarto the Akkadians.The Greek historian Herodotus lived in the 5th century BCE and hailed fromIonia. He delineated the Egyptian civilization into three dynasties and themodel is still used by Egyptologists today. Manetho, the Egyptianpriest-historian appears to have agreed with Herodotus partitioning the Egyptruler ship, with the exception that instead of 3 dynasties, he included anadditional era that was ruled by the gods alone. Manetho states that the firstdynastic rulers of Egyptian gods ruled for 12,300 years [16]: 1st Egyptian Dynasty Ruler Reign (years)Ptah9,000Ra1,000Shu700Geb500Osiris450Seth350Horus300Table 1: First Dynasty of Egypt Again, we find astonishingly long reigns listed in Table 1 above for the FirstEgyptian Dynasty rulers. It is interesting to note that in the Sumerian texts,Enki, a high-ranking deity from the city of Eridu, was assigned the regions ofEgypt and Africa by his father Anu, on or before 3760 BCE. It just so happensthat the Jewish calendar, whose origins are from the Sumerian city of Nippur,begins its count in 3760 BCE as well. Coincidence you might be thinking, butnot according to the ancient cuneiform texts.The second Egyptian dynastic period, according to Manetho, was composed oftwelve divine rulers that reigned for 1,570 years. The first god that ruled thesecond dynasty of gods was Thoth, who, it turns out, is also a son of Enki. Next, Egypt was ruled by thirty demigods whose reign lasted for 3,650 years intotal. Later, the Pharaonic dynasty, which scholars believe began approximately3100 BCE, lasted for 350 years and was headquartered at Men-Nefer, or Memphis inGreek. Who were these deities? Clues to the mystery are further confounded whenviewing the Sumerian King’s List. Some of the reigns for the first kings inSumer lasted up to 28,800 years according to the records. This is quitedifficult to believe. The Sumerians claimed that all aspects of civilizationwere taught to them by the deities that were worshipped in the temples ofMesopotamia. Detailed knowledge about the orbital plane, tilt axis, sphericalshape, and processional behavior of the earth’s equinox were known by theSumerian deities, who were also credited for creation of the Zodiac. Contrastthis detailed level of knowledge in Sumer with that possessed in Europe duringthe Middle-Ages. Scientists and church authorities in Europe were at oddswhether the earth was round or flat while the peoples of Sumer and thesurrounding region had advanced mathematics, metallurgy, law codes, and producedmany of civilizations first inventions and advanced achievements [41].A female Sumerian deity, Inanna, was also known as Hathor in Egypt and her nameis well recognized and memorialized on the walls of temples to include theTemple of Hathor found on Mount Serabit El Khadim, the Biblical Mount Sinai; themountain in the wilderness of the deity Nannar-Sin. The deity Sin is alsodescribed in various traditions to include Assyria, and those cultures thatassociate with the crescent moon symbol found on flags and mosques affiliatedwith the religion of Islam. The male deity recognized as the moon god to thepeoples of Mesopotamia was Nannar-Sin who also had a sister, none other than thegoddess Inanna aka Hathor to the Egyptians. From the genealogy accountsinscribed in baked clay on display in museums throughout the world the authorsreadily proclaimed in the Sumerian records, Nannar-Sin was the son of Enlil, andwas also known as the moon god to peoples of the ancient Middle East. Thereare links in historical texts indicating that Nannar-Sin had a very largefollowing in his cult centers that were prolific in the area from southern Iraqto Syria, Turkey and Iran. Interestingly enough, the Kaaba stone in Mecca,Saudi Arabia, one of the sacred centers for the religion of Islam, wasoriginally dedicated to the moon god, referred to there as Allah. CouldNannar-Sin be the deity that Mohammed had an encounter with in the wilderness? Is Nannar-Sin the fabled Allah?At this historical juncture, the very instance one proper noun replaces another,especially as it relates to a deity’s name; a new epithet begins as an old oneis occluded or subsumed. Witnessing the Sumerian deity Enlil whose origins weremysterious but had been recorded and witnessed daily by the Biblical patriarchAbraham and peoples of the city of Ur, become the lofty one of the mountain, ElShaddai and eventually Jehovah to the people of the land of Israel, was anastounding discovery that linked the deities of Sumeria with at least one God ofthe old testament. This fact becomes apparent when comparing the Sumerian StormGod (Enlil) written about in the Lamentations of Ur with the God of wrath andvengeance of the Old Testament. More personable Gods were worshipped elsewherein the region: like Enki, aka Ahura Mazda as he was known in ancient Persia,the “creator of all good things, god of light and wisdom” Ahura Mazda wasreplaced by Allah, aka Nannar-Sin when Arab conquerors overtook the Persians in633 BCE, headquartered at their spectacular capital at Persepolis. The Arabincursion led to the decline of the Zoroastrian religion with the ending of theSassanid Empire in 644 BCE.Subsumption of names and epithets was a common practice performed by Egyptianand Sumerian cultures to solidify power and authority. This was a method usedto coalesce multiple namesakes into a single name, one that was crafted to fitthe culture and language used by the worshipping subjects, probably for ease ofreference and aggregation of rivals when convenient.When one realizes with full force that what one culture calls a deity is thentermed by another name in a follow-on culture that the idea of a cultural mythtakes on more significance, especially if the name is traceablecross-culturally. See God Table 9. For just as the purveyor of truth inhistory are hand-selected by the victors, the validity of a belief whetherpolitical or religious is perpetuated in a society by the same governingforces. Thus what the victor believes is truth; what others believe is politelytermed myth instead of the politically incorrect label of lie. Similarly, whendiscussing religious truth, there is what the ruling party or superpowerbelieves and what the subordinated cultures believe which is given a derogatorylabel as pagan or occult. A horribly relevant example of this is taking placeand manifesting presently in the Middle East where the religious factionsrepresenting Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are waging war in the ancient landof Canaan, near Mount Megiddo located approximately 15 miles south of Haifa,Israel. Warring factions whose genealogy derives from rival deities originatingin Sumeria are still in conflict today. The devotees of Enlil, AKA Yahweh theGod of the Old Testament, stand toe to toe with the followers of Enki-Poseidon,apparently still at odds with each other over dominion of the earth. Could theconflicts involving the countries of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Israel be a result ofthe past wars that took place between Enlil and Enki and their offspring aswritten about in the “Wars of Gods and Men“by Zecharia Sitchin? Whether truth orfiction, dogma or doctrine, the armies of the generals of the earth are gatheredtogether once again in the Middle East where the nuclear countdown clock is justabout out of time. Will the offspring of Enki interrupt the destructive planhis arch rival Enlil (Zeus to the Greeks) along with his warring son Ninurta(Apollo to the Greeks). Is it possible that the reason the Jewish people rejectJesus as the Messiah is because he was the offspring of Enki, Jehovah’s rival? These and many more profoundly important topics are explored with the reader inthis book.

Additionally, from the list of characters detailed as“deities” in Mesopotamian literature like the “Epic of Gilgamesh”, we know thatthe head of the Anunnaki council of 12 was chaired by Anu, the father of the twokey players and half-brothers Enlil and Enki. Figure 1 below depicts thecouncil composition as of 3760 BCE.From the digitized cuneiform script, one can compose the word NI.BI.RU fromthree syllables which are listed in the Unicode as hexadecimal font codes 1224C,12204C, and 12292. [../images/00004.jpeg] [../images/00005.jpeg] [../images/00006.jpeg]NI=1224C BI=12204C RU=12292Anunna_Council_3760 [../images/00007.jpeg]Figure 1: Anunnaki Council of Twelve on Earth 3760 BCE Thus, a more accurate interpretation of the word Anunnaki is those who from Anuto the Earth came or was sent. Annuna is a self-referenced term Enlil uses fortheir race in the Atrahasis on the Mount Ararat encounter with Ziusudra. Thus,an alternative way of spelling it would be Annua.Ki, specifying a different setof Uniform Hexadecimal codes allocated to the Cuneiform Script as shown for thespelling of Nibiru previously. Equating the planet Nibiru with the word Heaven,as used in the Bible, is an important detail when re-examining prayers like “OurFather who art in Heaven…” shining a whole new light on who the Father in Heavenactually was, namely Anu. Thus the prayer must have originated among one of hiskids on Earth, Enlil, Enki, or Ninmah or Ninharsag as depicted in Figure 1above.What was the reason that the Anunnaki left Nibiru to come to the Earth? Nibiru,located beyond Pluto in our Solar System, is trapped in a 3600-year retrogradeelliptical orbit around our sun. According to maps found in Sumeria, andreports from the 1986 IRAS Naval Observatory discovery of a brown dwarf in theregion Nibiru was reported to reside by the Sumerians, and the intense Catholicfocus on Mount Graham using the Lucifer scope watching for Nibiru’s arrival, theplanet is real. So, what prompted an advanced civilization on Nibiru to send a team ofexploratory scientists to Earth? According to the genealogy table shown inFigure 2 below, various political struggles for power were ongoing withenvironmental pressures garnering the attention of the governing council onNibiru. For those with diminishing eyesight, Figure 2 is reproduced as a fullsize drawing, for ease of reference in Appendix A. [../images/00008.jpeg]Figure 2: Anu Family History on NibiruBrown dwarf planets, as we know, do not receive significant solar radiationsufficient to keep the surface temperature habitable, as is the case for Earthgiven its optimal distance from the sun. The atmosphere on Nibiru was generatedeither artificially or from gasses and released steam from the geo-thermallyheated planet. Consider the periodic exposure of an outer planet that normallyreceives very low levels of direct solar radiation in its outer orbit butintense exposure during the close perigee when the atmosphere would receive alarger radiation dose. According to Sitchin’s published history timeline [88]approximately 450,000 years ago, life on Nibiru was facing extinction due to adeteriorating atmosphere and the subsequent exposure to radiation, especially atclose perigee with the sun. This event is depicted in Figure 2 shown in thedialog box at the bottom left hand side. A political struggle was also taking place on Nibiru, wherein Anu succeeds inwresting kingship from the unjust ruler Alalu, leading to his exile. Alaluescapes in a space craft in anticipation of his exile sentencing andsubsequently discovers gold on Earth. Alalu’s precious metal discovery is usedas a peace offering in his veiled attempt to save Nibiru’s failing atmosphere. The hope is that the ionized god shield will shield the solar radiation bydispersing ionized gold particles into the home planet’s degrading atmosphere.Anu dispatches his premier scientifically-minded son Enki to assess thepossibility of recovering Alalu’s reported gold from Earth. Enki departs forEarth approximately 5,000 earth years later 445,000 ago, noting that a Niburianyear is equal to 3,600 earth years. According to Sumerian records, to includethe Sumerian King’s list, the first city colonized by the Anunnaki was Eridu,located at the headwaters of the Persian Gulf [16]. Following their arrival onEarth, Enki, along with a small band of support staff, began prospecting forgold in the waters of the Gulf, with limited success. The lack of progress inproducing a sufficient amounts of gold to repair the ailing atmosphere promptsAnu to send his younger son, Enlil, to help Enki speed up the gold recoveryprocess. The mining operation was being transitioned from the waters of thePersian Gulf to mining the ore located by Enki in South Africa, in the vicinityof the Zambezi River. Given the support infrastructure that would be needed tocrush rock and process gold-laden ore, Enki and Enlil invited Anu to come toEarth and provide council on the arduous mining task. Between approximately 445,000 to 360,000 years ago, Anu arrived on Earth and wasbriefed on the current gold mining operational status that his son Enki wasspearheading. A question of which brother should handle the mining operation inAfrica and which would head up the command headquarters in Mesopotamia,specifically in Nippur, was at issue. According to the Atrahasis account, Anu,Enlil, and Enki drew lots to determine which mission each would pursueseparately, creating space between the two half-brothers that were often atodds. Enki was the first born son to Anu and Antu. Enlil was, according tothe Sumerian accounts, the rightful heir. Based on Niburian inheritance rules,the rightful heir is designated as the offspring of the male and hishalf-sister. The reason this was done by the Anunnaki was rooted in science. The female contribution to the genetic material includes mitochondrial DNA whichthe male does not. This predisposes the genetic blood line toward the maternalsource.Following the drawing of lots, Enlil was assigned to the Mesopotamian regionwhere he would eventually be served by Terah and his son Abram in the temple atUr. Enki was assigned to the Abzu (Africa) to speed up the gold miningoperation badly needed to repair the Niburian degenerating atmosphere. Anureturned to Nibiru to run the kingship back on the home planet. Inanna, Anu’sfavorite granddaughter, was given the Indus Valley region, and the SinaiPeninsula was retained for use by the Anunnaki. The division took place and wasfinalized in the calendar year 3760 BCE.Approximately 415,000 years ago, Enki’s half-sister Ninharsag, a medicalofficer, traveled to Earth and established her medical center at Shuruppak. Hermission was to provide health care support for the space traveling Niburianastronauts. There were complaints from the Anunnaki about noticeable agingeffects that were not seen on Nibiru. It was postulated that the more rapidcircuits they were experiencing on Earth versus Nibiru with a much slowercircuit, namely a 3,600 year shar.CityFunctionNippurMission Control CenterSipparSpace PortShuruppakMedical CenterBad TibiraGold Ore ProcessingLarsa and LagashNavigational AidsUrCommand Headquarters, EnlilEriduEarth Station One, Enki HQTable 2: Pre-Dilluvial Anunnaki Outposts Several cities were established in Sumeria, augmenting the existing Eridu builtby Enki upon his prior arrival. These cities were designed to provide specificfunctions related to the mining operation and subsequent ore processing as wellas the infrastructure needed to remain in communications with Nibiru [13]. Table2 depicts the cities and their respective functions. Figure 3 shows arelational city map. [../images/00009.jpeg]Figure 3: Pre-Dilluvial Anunnaki Cities in Mesopotamia As told in the Atrahasis, approximately 300,000 years ago in Enki’s domain inSouthern Africa, the Anunnaki Council of 12 met to discuss how to increase goldproduction rates. Background information from the account sets the scene forthe ancient astronaut’s noteworthy recorded historical event. The higherranking members of the Anunnaki Council, purportedly Enki himself, broughtseveral subservient workers to help with establishing the gold mining outpost onEarth. The Lost Book of Enoch refers to them as Watchers [36], but theAtrahasis calls the miners Igigi. They were apparently very advanced relativeto humans, although designated the working class agent. Fig 3 depictsarcheological sites in Mesopotamia. Difficult labor-intensive tasks were assigned to the Igigi, to include dredgingrivers, digging and constructing aqua ducts, building cities and last, but notleast, mining gold-bearing ore in Southern Africa. Apparently, they were notsupplied with female companions during their alien deployment to Earth miningover a long period of time, measured in Niburian orbit lengths as a sharequaling 3,600 Earth years. What follows is an excerpt from the first tabletfrom the Atrahasis, the Old Babylonian Version (OBV) as translated by StephanieDalley in her Oxford World’s Classics book entitled Myths From Mesopotamia:Creation, the Flood, Gilgamesh, and Others, [37, pps. 9-10].. Atrahasis Tablet 1 [37, pg. 9]When the gods instead of manDid the work, bore the loads,The gods’ load was too great,The work too hard, the trouble too much,The great Anunnaki made the IgigiCarry the workload sevenfold.Anu their father was king,Their counselor warrior Ellil,Their chamberlain was Ninurta,Their canal-controller Ennugi.They took the box of lots…,Cast the lots; the gods made the division.Anu went up to the sky,And Ellil took the earth for his people.The bolt which bars the seaWas assigned to far-sighted Enki.When Anu had gone up the sky,And the gods of the Apsu had gone below,The Anunnaki of the skyMade the Igigi bear the workload.The gods had to dig out canals,Had to clear channels, the lifelines of the land,The Igigi had to dig out canals,Had to clear channels, the lifelines of the land.The gods dug out the Tigris river bedAnd then dug out the Euphrates….In the deep they set upThe Apsu of the landInside it raised its topOf all the mountainsThey were counting the years of loads;For 3,600 years they bore the excess,Hard work, night and day.They groaned and blamed each other.Grumbled over the masses of excavated soil.“Let us confront the chamberlains,And get him to relieve us of our hard work!” With mutiny in the air, summarizing the key points of the first tablet, theIgigi surround Enlil’s encampment (Ellil in the OBV translation) and demand tobe relieved of their excessive work load. Anu, Enlil and Enki’s father on Nibiruis summoned for his advice and counsel. Enki is also invited to help to come upwith a resolution to the unrest in the mines. The Igigi are temporarilyappeased with promises of work relief while the Anunnaki Council meets todiscuss the rioting Igigi gold miners. Enki and Ninharsag, his half-sister andChief Medical Officer, team up to develop a genetic hybrid being, a primitiveworker, to replace the Igigi gold diggers. Next chapter the evidence supportingthe Anunnaki on earth is explored with the reader.

Evidence categories examined include Astrological, technical, documentary, andbiological evidence."},{"pageContent":"ASTROLOGICAL EVIDENCEThe Sumerian creation tale, as recorded on the Enuma Elish [89] clay tablets ondisplay at the University of Pennsylvania Museum, is told as an allegory ofcelestial warriors whose skirmishes and exploits lead to the planets and theirhosts established circuits around the sun. The Old Babylonian Version (OBV) ofthe clay tablets that record the Cuneiform inscribed tale, were dated toapproximately 1936-1901 BCE. According to the Sumerian records, Marduk, firstborn son of Enki, was the national deity of Babylon, and was at the height ofhis reign at approximately 2000 BCE. It is proffered that a much older version of the creation tale is in existence,which had Nibiru named as the home planet, Nibiru, which was replaced by thename Marduk in the OBV. The names of the planets and their orbital distancefrom the sun are accurately depicted, with exceptions. What is amazing aboutthe Babylonian creation account is the advanced knowledge of our solar systemthat has only recently been verified by modern science. Is it possible thatcurrent scientific knowledge is only now maturing to the point that we canvalidate the Babylonian Epic of Creation? The account specifies ten versus nine planets and includes the sun and moonamong the hosts. Table 3 below depicts the solar system planets and theNiburian names assigned to them. Note also that the Anunnaki elite have planetsassociated with their namesake and there were a total of 10 planets, versus ourcurrent understanding and acceptance of only 9, according to the Sumerianrecords.

The story begins withthe Sun and Mercury conspiring to destroy Tiamut. Enki learns of the plot andshields Mercury by quelling the Sun’s radiation. Enki then puts Mercury to“sleep” [37, p235] Enki puts the sun to sleep as well. Mercury, the counselorwas in a sleepless daze. Ea (another name for Enki) unfastened his belt, tookoff his crown, then took away his mantel of radiance and put it on himself. Note that Enki’s planet is Neptune and could be inferring that Mercury’s orbitwas temporarily changed while dealing with the solar radiation issue from theSun. Nibiru rested on top of the sun for 900 years (captured in the sun’sorbit?) [33]. the sun’s solar radiation disturbs Tiamut, Ea and his wife Damkinahave offspring, namely their firstborn son Marduk. Herein, Marduk takes libertywith the account as the progeny of the high ranking members of the AnunnakiCouncil, establishing his birthright spawned in the heavens. Marduk took overthe council rank of 50 from Enlil at the height of his rule in Babylon. The signs of the Zodiac in the Heavens are described to include Taurus, Pisces,and Capricorn. Qingu (currently the Earth’s moon) was aligned with Tiamut, whichheld the tablet of destinies. Neptune attempts to quell Tiamut’s fury, stirredby the Sun, turning back and reporting to Anshar (Saturn). This forces Tiamutto stray from its orbital path. Ea recommends disbanding Tiamut’s forces andvolunteers Marduk (Nibiru) to help. Nibiru is drawn into Saturn’s orbit,providing a calming effect. A satellite or moon of Saturn is sent to Mercuryand Venus as a probe, whereby Mercury and Venus are alluded to as ancestors ofSaturn. A Radiation weapon termed inhullu-wind is alluded to as an evil wind,the tempest, the whirlwind that releases 7 winds against Tiamut, advancingbehind in Tiamut’s path. A flood weapon is used against Tiamut, as an asteroid(arrow) hits Tiamut splitting it open. Subsequently, Qingu is destroyed. Aconstellation of planets, stars, and remnants of Tiamut are captured in Nibiru’sorbit. The lower part of Tiamut is trampled, sending one half of its mass tothe roof of the sky, drawing a bolt across it and a guard to hold it. Then thewaters were arranged so they coagulated to an ocean. Nibiru’s course was thencorrected, and the location affixed to the stand of Enlil (planetary affiliationis Jupiter, Zodiac symbol of Taurus) and the stand of Enki (Zodiac affiliationPisces, Planetary Affiliation is Neptune). The Earth’s moon was previously amoon of Tiamut. The reader would be well served to read the Enuma Elish in its original form toget a sense of the detailed creation epic. From this allegorical account at thepoint of creation in our solar system, Tiamut, a planet the size of Uranus, hadan established orbit between Mars and Jupiter. Earth had not come intoexistence at that time. Nibiru was somehow captured into our solar system’sorbit, with various hypothesis about whence it came. This capturing started thecelestial battle for orbital position if you will. When Nibiru entered itsorbital path around the sun, passing the outer planets introduced gravitationalforces that tilted Uranus on its side and dislodged Pluto from its orbit aroundSaturn, promoting it to planet hood only to be demoted recently by thescientific community. Then, one of Nibiru’s satellites strikes Tiamut enroute to solar perigee and onits next orbital path Nibiru hit Tiamut directly. A large part of Tiamut brokeoff and became the Earth, with the left over debris becoming the asteroid belt,currently located between Mars and Jupiter. The Earth congealed into a solidplanet in its current orbit capturing a moon of Nibiru as its own. Some modernscientific analysis of the earth’s deep rifts in the Pacific as well as itsunusually large size moon have been corroborated with the Sumerian creationaccount read every spring in Babylon. An impact from Nibiru could also havetransferred the seeds of life to Earth, a form of accidental Panspermia versusthe intentional one proposed by Dr. Jonas Salk of San Diego, suggesting thatintelligent beings intentionally seeded planet Earth with alien life forms. The most important part of the Epic of Creation specifies one additional planetin our solar system, the Anunnaki’s home planet of Nibiru, whose apogee ispositioned beyond Pluto in a 3,600 year retrograde orbit around the sun. Corroborating evidence was provided by the former chief of the U.S. NavalObservatory, Dr. Robert S. Harrington. A gent named Tombaugh discovered Plutoin 1930 and its moon Charon was found in 1978. Planetary wobbles in the orbitalpaths of Uranus and Neptune spawned the use of an infra-red astronomicalsatellite, IRAS in 1983 to locate the suspected planet that induced the wobbles.The IRAS produced results indicating a large brown dwarf, four times the size ofthe Earth, had been located, without question. A newspaper article was published in 1992 by Harrington and Van Flandern of theNaval Observatory, working with all the information they had at hand, publishingtheir findings and opinion that a tenth planet had been located in our solarsystem, even calling it an intruder planet. [82] Zecharia Sitchin and Dr.Harrington, being familiar with all Sitchin’s writings about a tenth planet, metto correlate the IRAS findings with the account he had interpreted from theBabylonian Epic of Creation, the Enuma Elish. Given the evidence reported bythe IRAS, other space probes like Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager, and thecorroborating orbital path, planet size, and retrograde characteristics of thetenth planet, Harrington agreed with Sitchin that it was Nibiru [82] The passage of a planet as large as Nibiru between Mars and Jupiter wouldcertainly have a noticeable impact every 3,600 years. It is highly probablythat Nibiru’s passage may be responsible for pole shifts and reversals, changesin the Earth’s precession about its axis, and potentially dangerous meteors andspace debris drug along from the asteroid belt inbound to perigee.

Examples include hieroglyphs from the Egyptian temple of Abydos depictingrockets, airplanes, submarines, and even an advanced helicopter that lookssimilar to the United States AH-64 Apache Helicopter. There is also the Iraqibattery find, precision stone masonry and architecture using megalithic stones. Of all the building materials accessible to a culture, why choose the mostdifficult material possible? Massive 1000 ton plus stone blocks? The trilithonstones of Baalbek, Lebanon come to mind. The answer is more than likely becausethey could and it was easy for them. One of the most intriguing finds was the temple of Hathor atop the BiblicalMount Sinai. Within the temple was found a strange white talcum powder that wasapparently the result of smelting gold as it turned out [48]. This find led tothe re-discovery of mono-atomic gold by David Hudson. These room temperaturesuperconductors have anti-gravity properties and have been postulated to havebeen leveraged to move the large stone blocks used in temple construction. Additionally, there is clear evidence that the Anunnaki of a chosen blood line,were ingesting the mono-atomic gold in the form of conical bread cakes asdepicted on Hathor’s temple walls [48]. The shorter orbital cycles on Earthwere having a negative effect on the Anunnaki DNA; specifically the telomereswere being damaged by close proximal radiation from the sun [14, 16]. Theingestion of mono-atomic gold has the effect of “lighting up” the human energybody as well as provisioning a bridge to other dimensions due to the missingatomic mass of the multi-pass annealing process applied to the smelting gold. Other ingredients were added to the gold to cause it to turn into a white powderand lose its mass, mainly Antimony. Findings from around the world to include model airplanes, incrediblysophisticated solar and lunar temples aligned to solstice and equinox alike,along with tens of thousands of clay tablets and written accounts of advancedbeings teaching civilizing technologies to indigenous peoples pointsoverwhelmingly to the fact that the Anunnaki were here on Earth. Impressive remnants left behind by the ancient Anunnaki astronauts are thestructures in the pre-dilluvial cities in Mesopotamia such as Eridu, Babylon,and Uruk where the famed Gilgamesh was King. Evidence List: 1. Building structures like Baalbek defy current engineering abilities [70]. 2. Gold mines carbon dated to the period that Enki was said to be in Africa approximately 200,000 years ago [13, 14]. 3. Stone dwellings occupied by Mankind’s true ancestors, Anunnaki genetic slaves, found by Michael Tellinger near the gold mining operation. Awaiting verifiable bodies found with DNA testing [111], queued up yet Michael? 4.

Enuma Elish, on display in the University of Pennsylvania museum, has very sophisticated and technically accurate description of celestial collisions that led to the composition of our current solar system. In this depiction, Sumerians knew about Pluto that took NASA until 1980s to positively identify the planet. How did they know this [37, 89]? 6.

The Sumerians did not inventthe concept of a mythological entity, but rather found in those records that theSumerians knew the astronauts were not from Earth and were elevated as gods inthe various cities where they took up residence in Ziggurat Temples. The aliensthat setup the Sumer civilization were real flesh and blood who routinelyinteracted with the people, their genetic underling creation. Ashurbanipal’slibrary at Nineveh was torched, firing many of the clay tablets therein,preserving them for antiquity. Recently a sealed nine by six foot room in theAnunnaki space port of Sippar was found. Within the sealed chamber were nearly400 chronologically ordered clay tablets which detailed the unbroken record ofthe Anunnaki’s travails during mission Earth [82]. Sitchin was instrumental ingetting the Sumerian details about the Anunnaki records for the world to see. It has taken over 100 years for the information to be accepted thus far. Tablets are now digitized for translation speed and accuracy [63]. Physical evidence that correlates to the documentary evidence is not hard tofind either. The Sumerian Atrahasis document indicates that the Anunnaki weremining gold in Africa. Those ancient mines have been found and carbon dated,indicating they could have been in used by 200,000 year old miners with links toour true biological ancestors according to Michael Tellinger, author of “Adam’sCalendar” [111] and the “Slave Species of God” [119].

This was also corroborated by the GeneticAdam study tracking the mutation of the Y-chromosome, leading to the same areaand time frame as the Genetic Eve study. The Atrahasis provides several detailsabout mixing animal, and Anunnaki DNA until the final solution was found, HomoSapiens Sapiens [37]. The intelligence that the Anunnaki stated that mankind received accounts for ourout of place and time rapid technological developments that have seen advancedspace travel after only 200,000 or so years of evolution. This does not jivewell with the record on how tool progress iteratively occurred over millions ofyears, versus rapid paradigm shifts like that of the Sumerians forward [43]. Inthe next chapter, we will take a closer look at mankind’s genetic creator. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4: ENKI THE SCIENTIST: MAN’S CREATOR The Anunnaki found themselves in a considerable bind conducting the miningoperations in South Africa. After arriving with Enki almost 432,000 years ago,the Igigi helped colonize the Earth. After splashing down in the Persian Gulf,building Eridu (Earth Station One) and attempting to unsuccessfully gleansufficient quantities of gold from the ocean, the mining operation was moved theAbzu (Africa) along the Zambezi River. The Igigi were later accompanied bylower echelon workers that were dedicated to the gold ore mining task. Afterlong periods working in the mines, under what appears to be harsh conditions,the miners rebelled surrounding Enlil’s fortress, and demanded relief. The following passage from the Atrahasis captures the emotional mood the minerswere in after, according to the account, working for 3,600 years (1 sharcoincidentally = 1 Niburian Solar Year). Atrahasis Tablet 1 [37, pg. 10]Come, let us carry Ellil,The counselor of gods, the warrior, from his dwellingThen Alla made his voice heard,And spoke to the gods his brothersCome! Let us carry Ellil,The counselor of gods, the warrior, from his dwelling.Now, cry battle!The gods listened to his speech,Set fire to their tools,Put aside their spade for fire,Their loads for the fire-god,They flared up. When they reachedThe gate of warrior Ellis’s dwelling,It was night, the middle watch,The house was surrounded… Enlil’s guards, Nusku and Kalkal, roused their master to the rabble that wassurrounding his house. When Enlil was told he was surrounded by the Igigiminers, he had weapons brought to his dwelling. Nusku, Enlil’s vizier,cautioned him to seek counsel from his father Anu and to also fetch Enki. Anuand Enki were summoned to an impromptu Council meeting to discuss what to doabout the revolting lower echelon Anunnaki. Atrahasis Tablet 1 [37, pg. 10]Anu king of the sky was present,Enki king of the Apsu attended.The great Anunnaki were present.Ellil got up and the case was put.Ellil made his voice heardAnd spoke to the great gods,“Is it against me that they have risen?Shall I do battle…?Anu made his voice heardAnd spoke to the warrior Ellil,“Let Nusku go outAnd find out word of the IgigiWho have surrounded your door. Nusku, fully armed, approached the rabble mob and queried on behalf of Anu,Enki, Enlil, and the canal-controller Ennugi who was in charge and what theproblem was? The revolting miners told Nusku to give Enlil the message: Atrahasis Tablet 1 [37, pg. 12]“Every single one of us gods declared war!We have put a stop to the digging.The load is excessive, it is killing us!” Upon hearing the issue presented by Nusku on behalf of the fed up miners, Enlilwept upon hearing the news then turned to his father Anu and asked that one ofthe miners be made an example of by terminating him publicly. Atrahasis Tablet 1 [37, pg. 13-15]Anu made his voice heardAnd spoke to the gods his brothers,“What are we complaining of?Their work was indeed too hard, their trouble was too much.Every day the earth resounded,The warning signal was loud enough, we kept hearing the noise.(gap)Enki (Ea) made his voice heardAnd spoke to the gods his brothers,“Why are we blaming them?”Their work was too hard, their trouble was too much,(gap)Belet-ili the womb-goddess is present—Let her create primeval manSo that he may bear the yoke,So that he may bear the work of Ellil,Belet-ili the womb-goddess is present,Let the womb-goddess create offspring,And let man bear the load the gods!”(gap)Nintu (AKA: Belet-ili) made her voice heard,And spoke to the great gods,“It is not proper for me to make him.The work is Enki’s; He makes everything pure!If he gives me clay, then I will do it”Enki made his voice heardAnd spoke to the great gods,“On the first, seventh, and fifteenth of the monthI shall make a purification by washing.Then one god should be slaughtered.And the gods can be purified by immersion.Nintu shall mix clayWith his flesh and blood.Then a god and a manWill be mixed together in clay.Let us hear the drumbeat forever after,Let a ghost come into existence form the god’s flesh,Let her proclaim it as his living sign,And let the ghost exist so as not to forget the slain god.They answered “Yes”!” in the assembly,The great Anunnaki who assign the fates. So, the Anunnaki council, with Anu as the head of the assembly, makes thedecision to allocate Enki and Nintu (the medical officer also known asNinharsag) to the task of creating a primitive worker to replace the rebelliousIgigi miners. The Atrahasis continues in great detail describing the multiplegenetic attempts, failures, and abominable mishaps. When success was finally athand, Nintu, who was then promoted to Mistress of All Gods, spoke to theAnunnaki council. Even the mother of mankind has to submit a “TPS” report to justify heraccomplishment to her boss! Atrahasis Tablet 1 [37, pg. 16]“I have carried out perfectlyThe work that you ordered of me.You have slaughtered a god together with his intelligence.I have relieved you of your hard work,I have imposed your load on man.” The concept of genetic manipulation is not only understood among moderncivilized peoples today, but is so common that it is no big deal. Could it betrue that the Anunnaki, at least 450,000 years ahead of our civilization andhaving conquered space travel, had the ability to do in-vitro fertilization? According to the Atrahasis account, they certainly did. This brings intoserious question the idea of man’s concept of a “creator”. The question thatcomes to mind is whether the genetic scientist of our modern era is really anydifferent functionally than that performed by Enki in his African lab? Note theAnunnaki concept of a spirit transferred from a sacrificed being to another.This coincides with stories of underworld energy/soul maintenance. A point to consider from the Enuma Elish creation account is that the collisionbetween Nibiru and Tiamut, a portion of which became the Earth, could have beencontaminated with the seeds of life from Nibiru. These seeds of life, accordingto Enki’s writings, were from the Creator of All. Thus, the Anunnaki had ameta-concept beyond that of a god, which even the Igigi were sometimes called. Enki stated that the bipedal hominids he found on the African plains wererecognizable as a species based on the evolutionary process seen on Nibiru. Thus, the genetic upgrade given to early pre-human hominids was seen as atemporal head start program, not necessarily creating a new species alltogether. Mankind had an original Creator of All to thank for the seeds of life, alongwith the ancient astronaut Enki whose genetic seed was used as the archetypalAdapa, the first human, bearing the mark of the Anunnaki. Our ancient astronautidentity and intelligence is resident in our hybrid Anunnaki genes. A very important point is brought to the attention to the reader, given theknown age of the Atrahasis tablets written during the Old Babylonian Perioddated to 1700 BCE. The Sumerian flood account was clearly copied and modifiedto create the Genesis account, written by Hebrew priests being held captive inBabylon, where they had access to the true story of the great flood but chose toplacate Enlil as their chosen monotheistic ancient astronaut god. After all,they were scared to death of Enlil’s wrath. Genesis 6 describes the backgroundscene of the great flood from the Enlilite perspective, having tried toeliminate all references to the other members of the Anunnaki council in theTorah narrative, especially any reference to his arch rival and half-brotherEnki. Genesis 6:1-8 (NIV)When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born tothem, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and theymarried any of them they chose. Then the Lord said, “My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he ismortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years.” The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons ofGod went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroesof old, men of renown. The Atrahasis OBV account uses a very different catalyst that leads to thedestructive flood than the Genesis reference. In the Sumerian account, Enlil isfurious at mankind’s noise and wants them silenced. In the Genesis 6:1-8account, the fact that the Nephilim take human wives, potentially breakinggalactic law by shacking up with a genetic slave, is ignored by Enlil choosingto base mankind’s extinction tale on how evil men were as noted in the followingBiblical account. Genesis 6: 5 (NIV)The Lord saw how great man’s wickedness on the earth had become, and that everyinclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time.The Lord was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filledwith pain. So the Lord said, “I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, fromthe face of the earth… It is interesting to compare the Genesis account with the Atrahasis account. Here are just a couple of the bald faced lies which should be clear to the mostcasual observer. First, Enlil was not involved in the creation of mankind, ashe claims in Genesis 6:5. But rather Enki and Ninmah were solely responsible asevidenced in the Atrahasis, predating the Genesis account by at least 1,700years. If mankind’s thoughts were evil all the time, did that include the timethey were toiling in the mines to get gold ore for Enlil? His true complaint inthe Atrahasis account was repeatedly that mankind was noisy and he could notsleep. How about some earplugs? Hmm, too much trouble or was the idea ofprolific offspring of his arch rival brother that had the potential to rise upagainst his authority was more likely the case. Using terms like all and everyin Genesis 6:5 is a Boolean Logic no-no. Clearly the Biblical ghost writer(Enlil) was not trained in the scientific Boolean Logical rule set rules, oroften communicated in absolutes as evidenced herein.It’s interesting to consider that the “plant of knowledge of good and evil” waspresent in Sumeria, the Eden, and utilized by the Anunnaki. Enlil-Jehovah tellsAdapa in the Garden of Eden that if he eats it he will die. Enki counteractsthis lie and tells Adapa he will surely not die but instead become like one ofus, the gods. Thus, there seems to be a transformational effect, at the DNAlevel produced by this plant that changes human consciousness. In any event,Enki tells the truth and is demonized and symbolized as a snake, while Enlillies, and promotes himself as God. This lie, the fact that Adam did not die butrather became aware of his nakedness, attests to the stated outcome that Enkiprovided as the real reason Enlil did not want the plant of the knowledge ofgood and evil consumed. It was about controlling the access to higherconsciousness, frowned upon by Enlil.What happened next were unforeseen genocidal actions initiated by Enlil. Apparently after 600 years of the primal man breeding program humans wereprolific and noisy. Atrahasis Tablet 1 [37, pg. 18]600 years, less than 600 passed,And the country became too wide, the people too numerous.The country was as noisy as a bellowing bull.The God grew restless at their racket,Ellil had to listen to their noise.He addressed the great gods,“The noise of mankind has become too much,I am losing sleep over their racket.Give the order that sϋruppu-disease shall break out. This appears to be the genesis of all out conflict between Enki and Enlil. Mankind was Enki’s proud creation with the help of Ninharsag, successfullyalleviating the gods from the toils of the African gold mines just as hepromised. Of course Enki would take issue with an order to release some form ofdisease on the populace by his half-brother Enlil, whose obvious intent was towipe out the source of the noise, namely mankind. There were other deep-seatedsources of conflict between the two which will be addressed later in the book.These issues involved birthright, inheritance and official rank and titles. The NIV Bible corroborates the timeline from the creation of the Adapa to thetime that they were so numerous that Enlil wanted them terminated, namely 600years, Noah’s age at the time of the flood. Genesis 7:11 (NIV)In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the secondmonth—on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and thefloodgates of the heavens were opened. And rain fell on the earth forty daysand forty nights. Atrahasis later contradicts the 40 day continuous rain, specifying only 7 daysof rain in the Sumerian account. It is also interesting to question the agesshown in the Bible from Adam to Noah in Genesis 5. The phenomenal ages listedrange up to 895 years for Mahalalel and 962 years for Jared. Could it be thatthe ages were simply exaggerated or could the Anunnaki blood line, at its morepure state before dilution after generational mixing with mankind, accounted forthe exceptional ages mentioned therein? Another point worth noting is thegenetic age constraint the Anunnaki placed on their primitive workers, providingthem with the intelligence to follow instructions in the mines, but a short lifeto prevent overpopulation. As pointed out in Genesis 6:3, mankind was allotteda maximum of a 120 year lifespan. This coincides with the Atrahasis account. Checking online, the oldest person in recorded history was Ms. Jeanne Calment, aFrench woman who lived from 21 February, 1875 to 4 August, 1997. She wasofficially recorded to be 122 years, 164 days old. Looks like she broke theAnunnaki genetic mold by a small amount, namely 2 years and 164 days. Although,given the multitudes that have stepped foot on Earth, the 120 year geneticdesign target seems to have worked quite well. The text towards the end of Atrahasis Tablet 1 establishes that a closerelationship exists between Atrahasis and the great god Enki. From thegenealogy table shown in [48, pg. 316] and the Lost Book of Enoch [36], it isasserted that Atrahasis was none other than the offspring of Enki and Batanash,the wife of the Biblical Lamech [14]. That being said, Enki coordinates arebellion among mankind with Atrahasis his son, providing instructions as to howto perform a peaceful protest and shame the powers that be (Enlil) into ceasingthe punishment by sϋruppu-disease, whatever that ailment was. Enki’sintercession appears to have worked, much to Enlil’s chagrin, clenching his jawin preparation for the next onslaught against human fodder. Enlil orders a newgenocidal tactic: Atrahasis Tablet 1 [37, pg. 20]He addressed the great gods, (Elil= Enlil)“The noise of mankind has become too much, I am losing sleep over their racket.Cut off food supplies to the people!Let the vegetation be too scant for their hunger!Let Adad wipe away his rain. (Iskur Adad is one of Enlil’s sons)Below, let no flood-water flow from the springs.Let wind go, let it strip the ground bare,Let clouds gather but not drop rain,Let the field yield a diminished harvest,Let Nissaba stop up her bosom.No happiness shall come to them.” Again, Enki runs intercession on behalf of the people, coaching them how to dealwith the ill will of his half-brother, Enlil. Enki instructs the people toresist by not praying to their goddess and shaming Iskur Adad for averting rainfor the crops. Enki’s intercession works again, but not for long. Enlilpersists in his multi-pronged approach to wipe out mankind. He sends additionaldiseases to put an end to their noise. Mankind was summarily afflicted withsickness, headaches, and sϋruppu and asakku disease. Atrahasis Tablet 1 [37, pg. 26)The field decreased its yield, Nissaba turned away her breast,The dark fields became white,The broad countryside bred alkali,Earth clamped down her teats:No vegetation sprouted, no grain grew.Asakku was inflicted on the people,The womb was too tight to let a baby out.(gap)When the second year arrivedThey had depleted the storehouse.When the third year arrived,The people’s looks were changed by starvation.When the fourth year arrivedTheir upstanding bearing bowed,Their well-set shoulders slouched,People went out in public hunched over.When the fifth year arrived,A daughter would eye her mother coming in;A mother would not even open her door to her daughter.A daughter would watch the scales at the sale of her mother,A mother would watch the scales at the sale of her daughter,When the sixth year arrivedThey served up a daughter for a meal,Served up a son for food. Atrahasis seeks out his lord Enki yet again to protect himself and what is leftof mankind against the genocidal onslaught that Enlil has brought to bear. Thisrequest for intercession once again leads to conflict between the two brothers. Enlil, still not satisfied with the destruction and disease he has brought tofruition against mankind, orders Enki to cause a flood to wipe out the remaininghumans. Enki refuses angrily. Although the Anunnaki had the ability tomanipulate the weather with a system like HAARP, it is not clear in thesecircumstances that the great flood to come was caused by the Anunnaki, butrather by gravitational forces wrought by Nibiru’s passing Earth, enroute to a3,600 year solar perigee. The knowledge of a coming tsunami-wave generated byslipping ice sheets at the Poles [14], with the potential to wipe outMesopotamia, was to be kept from man by Enlil’s orders. So, whether theAnunnaki generated the flood event with a “flood weapon” or knew of itsimpending arrival based on perturbations in the heavens, Enlil took credit forthe cataclysmic destruction to augment his perceived power to punish [Genesis6:5]. Those familiar with the Old Testament God of wrath and vengeance ought tofind a familiar spirit in the deeds and attitude detailed in the Atrahasisaccount of Enlil and his genocidal crimes against humanity (Ellil in the OBVAtrahasis text.) Enki, in anticipation of either a planned or accidental massive flood event, outof concern for his son Atrahasis, decides to modify an oath he was asked toswear to the Anunnaki Council, to not tell the humans of the impending waterydisaster. Instead of warning Atrahasis directly, Enki directs his speech to thewall of the reed hut where his son is taking refuge. Atrahasis is told to builda boat: Atrahasis Tablet 1 [37, pg. 29)Wall, listen constantly to me!Reed hut, make sure you attend to all my words!Dismantle the house, build a boat,Reject possessions, and save living things.The boat that you build…Roof it like the Apsu,So that the Sun cannot see inside it!Make upper decks and lower decks,The tackle must be very strong,The bitumen strong, to give strength,I shall make rain fall on you here,(gap)He opened the sand clock and filled it,He told him the sand needed for the Flood wasSeven nights’ worth. As noted previously, the Genesis account states is rained for 40 days versus 7days in the Atrahasis. Looks like Enlil is attempting to symbolically blame Enkifor the flood by changing the number of days of rain to the same rank numberassigned to Enki, e.g. 40. This is merely speculation, but not out of characterfor the brothers. Either way, Atrahasis is the actual nautical savior ofmankind, the Biblical Noah. He was 600 years old, the King of the city ofShuruppak, which also served as a medical center for Ninharsag (Nintu,Bellet-Ili, Mami…many labels used for her, later to be called Isis in Egypt). When he was leaving his beloved city, Atrahasis relayed a story that the folksleft behind would clearly buy. He told them that his god Enki was at odds withEnlil, and since the city was now in Enlil’s region (Mesopotamia), that it wouldbe best for him to leave the region and go to Africa (Apsu) to find safety inEnki’s domain. What ensues in the tablets is a very detailed account of Noah’sark with full-blown Sumerian details. The commonly accepted date for the Great Flood written about in many culturesappears to have happened at the end of the last ice age, approximately 11,000BCE [18, pg 346]. Following the flood, Atrahasis in his bitumen built boat,landed on the highest mountain peak in the area, Mt. Ararat, with the aid of anAnunnaki navigator that Enki had placed on board the vessel. After much bellyaching over the loss of the humans, the Anunnaki spotted Atrahasis’ boat fromtheir airborne craft and landed on Mt Ararat to investigate the matter further."},{"pageContent":"Atrahasis Tablet III [37, pg 34)The warrior Ellil spotted the boat,And was furious with the Igigi.“We, the great Anunna, all of us, Agreed together on an oath!No form of life should have escaped!How did any man survive the catastrophe?”(gap)Enki made his voice heardAnd spoke to the great gods,“I did it, in defiance of you!I made sure life was preserved.” So there it is in black and white (okay, baked clay to text first), Enki createdmankind from his genes and rebelled against a genocidal order from his brotherEnlil to wipe out the primitive workers, saving his son Atrahasis from the greatflood that decimated the Mesopotamian civilization of Sumer. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5: PRIMITIVE WORKER = SLAVE As an engineer, it is interesting to think about what design constraints theAnunnaki scientist Enki would have considered given the need for a labor forceto operate the mines. Would the workforce be able to read and therefore followinstructions without input? Or would the miners be communicated to using a moreadvanced understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum and matter, potentiallytelepathically? What about mutinies? That must have been a design constraint toconsider given the mutiny that spawned the creation of a primitive worker in thefirst place. Thus, it seems from a safety and security standpoint, the ability to transmitand receive verbal or mental instructions, safely and securely, would have beena key primitive worker feature. How would one design a primitive worker suchthat the thoughts are sophisticated enough to translate the foreman’sinstructions into practical physical actions, like digging with a spade. Wouldthe primitive workers be taught to speak and understand audible commands? At the same time, if the primitive workers were provided intelligence from oneof the Igigi as stated in the Atrahasis, then what would prevent the humans fromexercising their intelligence, realizing they were enslaved, and revolt as theirpredecessors had done before? To answer some of these questions, one mustconsider the advanced topic of energy and matter interactions: namelytransmission of signals in the extreme low frequency (ELF) range that knownmental process occur, namely less than 20 Hz. What happens if an outside signal is at the same frequency as the brain, andpotentially at a higher signal amplitude? There would be interference, and thehigher powered signal would over-ride the thought generated in the biologicalbrain. Could the Anunnaki have been using a technology similar to our ownHAARP, the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program? In Jerry Smiths’sBook, “HAARP The ultimate Weapon of the Conspiracy”, the author poses thequestion: What if you had a single weapon that could destroy all of an enemy’s orbitingspy satellites at once? What if the that same weapon could wrap the earth in animpenetrable “shield”? One that would destroy all intercontinental ballisticmissiles attempting to pass through it? A weapon that could create clouds ofelectrons could do both. What could a nation at war do with a weapon that couldundetectably redirect the jet stream? The weather could be controlled over thewhole continents, causing floods and droughts as desired. A ground based radiotransmitter of sufficient size could achieve both aims. The technology can alsobe used as an earth penetrating tomography (EPT), which is useful for locatingmining or petroleum deposits underground. HAARP has built a transmitter ofsufficient signal strength to turn the aurora borealis into a virtual antenna,rebroadcasting in the ELF range [85]. What could a nation or a devious ancient alien do with a weapon that can “fryyour mind” or induce emotions such as fear or rage, at will. What if you coulddo it over a large area, affecting enemy troops on their way to battle? Wholecities? Even entire continents. The human brain works in the same ELF range that HAARP is occasionallybroadcasting. Could one control a targeted people by projecting holographicimages into the sky, images of the deities or nemesis’ whom they were taught toworship and fear? Transmitting in the ELF is analogous to sending a carrierwave; then modulate some “data” onto the carrier wave at the rate that thoughtimpulses are generated, and one may simulate broadcasting words, thoughts, orimages into the mind. This would be a very effective method for the Anunnaki tocommunicate with the underling humans that were, for the most part, not alloweddirect contact with the Niburian astronauts. Could HAARP technology provide theability to broadcast instructions or messages to a large work force, likeminers? An entire book will be dedicated to this topic at a future time, in theinterim suffice it to say that it is probably a safe bet that the Anunnakidesigned mankind such that the transference of information could be donebi-directionally, securely, and with telemetry capabilities in place to snoop inon the thoughts of the workers in anticipation of thwarting an unforeseen minermutiny. Consider the ability for modern imaging equipment to peer insideshipping containers, the human body at airport scanners, and the advancedimaging equipment utilized in Western medicine for disease analysis, like CATscans, X-Rays and the like. Deploying a satellite with the ability to glean theenergy body state of a human would be no problem. Why do such a thing? Giventhe nerve ganglia nodes along the human spine, termed Chakras in the Yogictradition, have been affiliated with discrete wavelengths or colors forthousands of years. Advanced beings like the Anunnaki could potentially haveequipment that depicts the human energy body at its discrete Chakra levels inorder to assess the intent of the being’s actions and denote the evolutionarydiscrete quantized energy levels mastered, the crown Chakra being the ultimateachievement. As a reminder, the Anunnaki designed primitive humans as slaves with thepremeditated intent to control/manage them for somewhat complicated mining andbuilding tasks, stating in the Atrahasis that intelligence was thereforeprovided as part of their design37. This creates a dilemma for the creator asone is not quite making a robot with a limited command set, but rather an entitywith intelligence that has the ability to acquire a sense of self or a center,which will ultimately lead to independence and revolt. This dilemma ultimatelyfaced both the Anunnaki masters and the Igigi, most likely a genetic lot ofslave workers from Nibiru brought along to work as miners, city builders, andwhatever the Anunnaki in charge needed general labor for. The Igigi, over time, were facing the same issue on earth that we are today,e.g. they were evolving from the primitive consciousness that was most likelyinstilled in them at their inception intentionally at a lower level than thecreator’s, effectively relegating the entity as a primitive worker, bettercalled slave. The gotcha in this equation is that evolution does not stop, andeventually over time, especially if given intelligence to handle more complextasks, the primitive worker evolves enough so that self-identity arises, muchlike we read about in the Biblical account of Adam and Eve in the garden ofEden. Self-consciousness is antithetical to slavery and Enlil knew that. Thushe realized that Enki had plans all along to create a workforce that wouldeventually become like they are, a significant threat to power. Additionally,providing the workforce the ability to breed ensured rapid population growth tomeet the labor requirements.Thus the Igigi slaves found their self-consciousness center over time on earthand revolted against their slave taskmasters the Anunnaki elite, creating theneed for a replacement slave workforce, e.g. Enki’s primitive workers,anatomically modern humans. Perhaps the difference or speeding up in timeexperienced by the ancient astronaut Igigi who were not used to the Earth’sshorter solar cycles, accelerated them finding their identity; which was whatcaused the revolt. Note that it took a long time for this to happen, many sharsaccording to the Igigi, with a shar equal to 3,600 years.Lord Enki certainly knew this, as his intent all along, was to simply“jumpstart” the current evolutionary process that was already occurring onearth. He recognized that the seeds of life on planet earth came from Nibiruin the first place (see their creation cosmology in the Enuma Elish involvingTiamut-Earth and Kingu-Moon with which it collided) and that Neanderthal manalready existed on Earth which Enki described finding in Africa, reporting it tothe Anunnaki council. Recall that Enki was assigned the African gold-miningoperating when he lost the dice roll with his brother Enlil over who had theright to stay in Mesopotamia. Enki subsequently took up roots in the Abzu orAfrica to oversee the gold mining operations there. So the genetic interventionwith the local Neanderthal species was justified and approved by the AnunnakiCouncil since in their minds they were simply jump-starting the primitiveearthlings to a higher state of evolution; Neanderthal to primitive worker; noharm, no foul right?Additionally the Anunnaki were purportedly facing environmental and atmosphericthreats on their planet such that the mission to Earth to get gold to use as ananodized layer in the atmosphere was critical in the most urgent sense. Enlilwas obviously furious over the subversive tactics and highly clever beings Enkihad created, and that Enki himself marveled over. From Enki’s lustful reactionto the primitive workers, he must have outdone himself playing genetic god as hebragged to his son Marduk about his escapades finding some beautiful earthlingwomen bathing at a stream and the encounters he had with them. Marduk laughsand comments on the pre-existing reputation his father Enki has with theopposite sex. Marduk also found the earthling women irresistible, giving up hisrights as a god on Nibiru in essence to marry Sarpanit, a mere mortal. Enlilalso led a raid early on to the captive primitive workers who were taken back toMesopotamia, to the ED.IN. Enki’s genetic evolution success may not have beenwelcome by his brother Enlil, but the slaves were useful for the labor needs athand.Given the tension between the brothers, Enki no doubt had all the bases coveredwhen confronting the security and control design issues for the primitiveworkers. How else would he control the primitive workers if they were allowedto grow in number posing a revolutionary threat to the small number of Anunnakielite that were present, easily overthrown by an angry mob of miners. Additionally, there were 600 Igigi according to the initial records as theyarrived on Earth that had to be governed already. So, the idea of creating alarger primitive workforce that had what appeared to be a higher level ofintelligence than even the Igigi had, was certainly cause for alarm to Enlilfrom a command and control viewpoint. From an antagonist brother standpoint, Enki was probably always looking for waysto poke holes in his brother’s façade, trip up his command effectiveness, andgenerally antagonize his brother and rightful heir: the higher rankingCommander Enlil. The reason this information is provided is to set the contextin which Enki would have had to convince the council to allow him to create aprimitive workforce whose primary issue would be security and control.It should be clear that in order to control a large number of slaves, methods ofcommunication were needed for individual commands relative to assigned tasks aswell as group tasks, like jointly pulling a rope, in unison. With the advancedabilities the Anunnaki demonstrated genetically, one should query whatcommunications methods they had designed into the primitive workers so that theycould be efficiently commanded and controlled? Or rather were the primitiveworkers running around in the mines using an electronic device like a Motorolawireless headset of today? Not likely. What would one do with a slave workerthat is suddenly out of communication? This is too risky. It’s like giving aradio to each individual in a prison ward, doesn’t work that way. A moreelegant biological approach would be preferable.It should be safe to assume that the Anunnaki grasp of communication technologywas much further along than ours is even today given their massive head start ingalactic time. Why carry an electronic device to interface to the slaves wheninstead you can use the electromagnetic spectrum to modulate data thereupon andsend it directly, silently, to a group or an individual instantly, not withelectronics like today, but biologically using frequency direct access methodsused by dolphins and other advanced creatures.What evidence supports the claim that humans have a built-in communicationreceiver? What about a transmitter too? Most modern civilizations hooked onthe internet know of, or have heard of a MODEM which stands formodulator-demodulator. Modulation is a term used by communication specialiststo send and receive information using the carrying waves in the electromagneticspectrum (EMS) as the messengers. If our modern society is able to use the EMSto send and receive data, certainly the Anunnaki were able to do so as well, butprobably more directly. Consider the possibility that the Anunnaki used the human structure orre-designed it such that it could be used as a biological communications device,susceptible to their commands as slave masters. First a brief primer on theevolution of the human brain is presented.Our brains comprise three distinct structures, representing three evolutionaryperiods. The oldest, deepest, and smallest area is the reptilian brain [90]. Thereptilian brain controls the heart, lungs, and other vital organs. It enablesaggression, mating, and reaction to immediate danger. Mammals evolved the limbic system. This is the middle layer of our brains,surrounding the reptilian brain. The physiological features unique to mammalsare in the limbic brain, e.g., the hypothalamus system for keeping us warm.The limbic brain also produces emotions. Emotions facilitate relationships.Mammals, unlike reptiles, care for their young. Mammals evolved brains hardwiredfor mother-child and other relationships.The most common reaction a reptile has to its young is indifference; it lays itseggs and walks (or slithers) away. Mammals form close-knit, mutually nurturingsocial groups-families-in which members spend time touching and caring for oneanother. Parents nourish and safeguard their young, and each other, from thehostile world outside their group. A mammal will risk and sometimes lose itslife to protect a child or mate from attack. A garter snake or salamanderwatches the death of its kin with an unblinking eye [92].The cerebral cortex (or neocortex) is the newest, outermost area of our brains.The oldest mammals, e.g., opossums, have only a thin layer of cerebral cortex.Rabbits have a little more, cats a bit more. Monkeys have a substantial cerebralcortex. Humans—and only humans—have an enormous cerebral cortex.The human reptilian brain and limbic system is similar in size and structure toother animals. Our ancestors evolved a huge cerebral cortex, while the olderbrain areas didn't change.The cerebral cortex learns new things. Animals with little or no cerebral cortexact only as their genes program them to act. Animals with a cerebral cortex canfind new foods, survive in new environments, or change their mating tactics toimprove reproductive success.The human cerebral cortex goes beyond learning new foods and survival skills.Our brains can think in abstractions. We communicate via symbols (e.g.,language), consider the past and future, and sacrifice our personal interestsnot only for our families (as other mammals do) but also for ideas (e.g., honorand country).Conflicts between brain areas lead to relationship difficulties. In a conflictedbrain, the older area wins. In contrast, an individual with an integratedbrain—e.g., who uses his or her whole brain—solves relationship problems."},{"pageContent":"RETICULAR ACTIVATING SYSTEMIt is known that the primitive organ within the human brain that is responsiblefor attention is the Reticular Activating System [90]. It is a part of theprimitive survival brain that, along with complementary nerve ganglia andnetworks within the human body. The operation of the primitive brain is thesource of intuition or gut-feelings, which provide the necessary control aprimitive human being would need to survive in its environment sans the moreevolved brain that involves reflective consciousness in the modern human being. It is believed by contemporary scientists that the further evolution of thebrain (over time or augmented by the Anunnaki?) added more complexity upon theexisting primitive brain system that is still functional and operatingsimultaneously. A question then arises, could the primitive brain, if properlystimulated, override the functions of the more evolved reflective consciousnessbrain? Possible answers to this query involve the various factors that affectmental processes that result in focusing one’s attention. Consider that what weare focused on may be influenced by marketing or something as invasive as aspecific frequency communicating directly with the primitive brain via thereticular activating system.Note that the Reticular Activating System (RAS) still controls awareness inmodern humans. The RAS is essentially a direct sense experience computer with aprimitive survival program always running in the background. Theevent-filtering consciousness-directing ability the RAS exhibits in humans maybe demonstrated directly [90]. One simple example is to touch someone someplaceon their body that they are not expecting or witness visually. This unseentactile sensation is processed by the recipient, who suddenly becomes aware ofthe body part where the touch sensation was triggered. This can also be done byverbally bringing someone’s awareness to the sensation of the feel of theirwristwatch. The differentiation between being generally aware conceptually thatthe spot exists “in the back of our minds” and the reality of our awarenessbeing physically brought to the sensory impact point, demonstrates the functionof the RAS. The recipient was not really aware of body part area where thetouch encounter took place until it happened. The RAS cannot simultaneouslybring awareness to more than one event at a time though it may have theappearance of being done in parallel, much like a computer system. Imaginebeing in a crowd and having twenty people perform this experiment at the sametime. The RAS could not process which touch sensation to respond to first. Thus, the RAS has the responsibility of bringing awareness to importantprioritized events in our environment, especially those events that impactsurvival. Figure 4 depicts the Reticular Activating Control Loop showing theseparate channels for Auditory impulses near the primitive brainstem below thehypothalamus.

[../images/00011.jpeg]Figure 5: Superposition in Waves "},{"pageContent":"HARMONICS AND BINAURAL BEATS. When a sound wave is produced it can produce lower amplitude copies of theoriginal signal spaced either side of the fundamental frequency. This normallylooks like spikes of decreasing size as the spectrum increases or decreaseseither side of the fundamental frequency. Suppose you mix two frequenciestogether and the difference between the frequencies is 10 Hz. Then every Nx10Hz there will be a harmonic or echo of the difference between the frequencies.,N=1,2,3..) So, expect to find energy at 10 Hz, 20 Hz, 30 Hz, etc. Some veryinteresting sounds can be created taking advantage of this fact. When twofrequencies are presented to the human auditory system, something veryinteresting happens. The human ear does not hear either frequencyindependently, but rather hears the difference. If the frequency differencefalls within the brain wave frequency common in humans, a phenomenon occurscalled entrainment. There are factors that affect the degree to which the humanbrain can change frequency to that of the differential between frequencies f1and f2. For example, suppose that one instrument produces frequency f1 at 150Hzand the second source produces frequency f2 at 152 Hz. Then in this case, thehuman auditory system, specifically the reticular activating system, will hearand possibly synchronize (entrain) to the 2 Hz binaural beat, F2-F1. Using anelectroencephalograph, human brain waves have been categorized as shown in Table4 below. The 2 Hz beat falls within the brain wave state termed Delta,characterized by Yogic states and deep sleep. Given that Thoth is the son of Enki, the creator of and key proponent of mankindbecoming the “Sons of God” through the awakening of their energy bodies(Chakras) and subsequent consciousness, which he designed to be sensitive to thevarious frequencies affiliated with the radial distance and frequencies causedby a spherical resonator, e.g. the Earth. One can read the Emerald Tablets toget a sense of the advanced energy knowledge Thoth possessed. Also, asevidenced by his staff the Caduceus, he was an adept geneticist. LawrenceGardner in his pre-eminent book Genesis of the Grail Kings, discusses themeaning of the ancient symbol associated with Thoth. Knowledge of energy,matter, and the human pineal gland were at play as a function of humanconsciousness connected to DNA. Read Lawrence’s book for more advanced details. A naturally occurring earth-generated frequency that falls within the humanbrain wave region is the Schuman Resonance Frequency. The equation is definedas the Speed of Light divided by the Earth’s circumference. Interestinglyenough, varying the depth at which the radial axis is projected from the centerof the Earth, other frequencies can be identified. Human brain waves operatefrom approximately 0.5Hz to about 20 Hz being segmented from Delta, Theta,Alpha, and Beta. The Schuman Resonant frequency falls in the Alpha brain waveregion being approximately 7.8 Hz.

The beat frequency oscillation (BFO) shouldbe apparent. Note that there is one complete cycle in 0.5 seconds or 2 cyclesper second (2 Hz) which is the difference between the two frequencies, namely403 Hz - 401 Hz. This BFO has the potential to entrain the human brain to 2 Hz,the basic concept behind sound entrainment. Perhaps that is why didgeridoo musicis so mesmerizing to some as it naturally mixes frequencies that lead to mentalentrainment or “dreamtime” according to the Aboriginal Australian tradition. The science behind the brain-frequency altering didgeridoo, appears to havesound entrainment as its shamanic and healing basis.

Recall the discussion of the ELFbeing used as a carrier frequency and all that is needed to remotely communicatethoughts or images to another human is to modulate tangible data onto thecarrier, emulating thoughts. What better data source than the human voice tomodulate the carrier… Domestic cats all purr at the same frequency! Big cats, scrawny cats, old tomcats, kittens--same frequency. Which indicates that purring isn’t somephysiological phenomenon but must be driven centrally from the brain? Purring isassociated with contentment, well-being, good health and a “trance-like”behavior. Do cats purr to massage their neurons? Do the neurons operate tomassage the cat with sound as has been demonstrated in the field of cymatics?According to Wikipedia, the Schumann resonances are a set of frequenciesproportional to the Earth’s electromagnetic field and its spherical resonantchamber whose fundamental frequency is about 7.8 Hz. This frequency occursbecause the space between the surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphereacts as a closed waveguide which acts as a resonant cavity for extreme lowfrequency waves excited by lightening. It is interesting to note that the ELFof 7.8 Hz falls within the brain wave range for humans, specifically the Alpharegion. Waking consciousness, in particular for those in the industrialized andleft-brain centric West, is generally in the Beta region from 13-20 Hz. Couldit be that the more highly focused and alert mindset spawned by Alpha brainwaves is the intended frequency for humans living on the surface of the Earth’sresonant chamber? Additionally, a correlation with the 9 Mayan underworlds (radii from center ofthe Earth) or the correlated spherical resonator frequencies and those thataffect the human energy body and consciousness were discussed by Dr. JohanCalleman in his book “The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation ofConsciousness.” [66] Seems as if the Mayans were instructed by Thoth asdescribed in the book “The Lost Realm” by Sitchin [19]. Wonder who taught theYucatan’s finest the advanced calendar concepts and correlation of humanconsciousness with frequency shifts in the brain waves? You can bet that Thothwas indeed there as the records show. The later invasion by Kulkulkhan isreminiscent of the Enlil (Zeus) backed Cretian pirates that invaded Enki’s(Poseidon) divine city of Atlantis, discussed later in the book in chapter 9."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6: ENERGY, MATTER AND CONSCIOUSNESS Enki designed primitive workers with highly scientific abilities: geneticfunctional mappings with human energy body composed of 7 chakras representativeof the 7th planet, Tiamut to the Anunnaki, Earth to us.[../images/00013.jpeg] Figure 7: The Human Chakras Discrete quantized energy states analogous to the atomic molecule model,described in the Yogic tradition as Chakras, provide humans a mechanism toevolve their consciousness to become “The sons of God”. This is where energymeets matter. The lowest energy state being affiliated with the root Chakra,located in the pelvic bowl, as shown in Figure 7. This root nerve complexclosest to the ground electrical potential of the Earth, is termed the ganglionof Impar. The highest energy state is represented by the seventh or crownchakra typically affiliated with the human pineal gland [8, pg. 67]. The Chakras provide access to an evolutionary means to allow mankind to continueon its path to godhood. These seven quantized energy states were intentionallydesigned by Enki’s providing mankind an interface for future evolution ofconsciousness. Enki did not seem comfortable accepting the concept of slaveryversus creating a primitive worker that just got a genetic jumpstart with thepotential of becoming one of the gods. He struggled with the idea of breakinggalactic law and creating primitive workers versus advanced tools as Enlil, muchto his credit, argued for during the Anunnaki Council of Twelve meeting wherethe group decision was made to produce a slave replacement for the Igigiminers. Thus, understanding the “mechanism” by which the primitive workerscould participate in the evolution of consciousness was highly classifiedknowledge: expect governments to suppress this evolutionary mechanism above allcompeting datum. Zodiac symbols representing spirit and matter, the circle and crossrespectively, are ancient. The modern day equivalent to the word spirit,religiously colored in its antiquated definition, is the more tangible term:energy. According to the laws of physics, energy is neither created nordestroyed but merely changes state. This is a very important fundamental lawthat applies to planets, humans, and all matter according to Einstein’s specialtheory of relativity, E=mc2. All matter possesses a potential to be convertedto some energy state as Einstein’s equation so eloquently shows.Man has been driven eternally at a primal level within the core of his being tofind the intersection of finite matter and infinity, which energy represents inits most un-manifested form. The energy that animates all matter, in particularliving matter, is accepted as either representative of, or a subset of, theinfinite creation. Modern scientific knowledge about the interaction between energy and matter issomewhat understood, although much room for advanced exploration remains. "},{"pageContent":"HUMAN ENERGYWhen I first thought about the problem of structure, it had nothing whatsoeverto do with the human body, but rather consumed my thoughts during my graduatework in electrical engineering at the University of California, San Diego. During the academic year 1996, I had somehow interweaved my curiosity in theevolutionary state of mankind into a doctoral research topic, evolvable hardwareand gotten my advisor to approve it, ha! Let me explain some of the backgroundlest the reader lose interest completely. A key component on many of theprinted circuit boards in the electronics industry is the field programmablegate array (FPGA). These sophisticated integrated circuits were being used asre-programmable devices in many cases and were highly desirable because theycould implement algorithms and logic at speeds much faster that a microprocessorcould achieve with software. Additionally, one could get the device to functionwithout the logic being exactly right all at once, but rather iterativelydevelop it. As the FPGA competition heated up, more and more complexarrangements of memory and logic found their way into the integrated circuitdesign. The primary FPGA manufacturing competitors were Altera and Xilinxcorporations. Xilinx introduced an FPGA that had a cellular array structurethat had never before been available to the market. This device was essentiallya very large matrix of programmable functional elements that also hadprogrammable interconnections. So what you posit? Well, a little morebackground is needed here. The software industry, and in particular the fieldof artificial intelligence, had been working with what were termed geneticalgorithms. These were algorithms that would create populations of entities andsimulate the evolution of these imaginary entities using stochastic processes(randomness) to evolve like a species that had the best ability to adapt to alife stress function, much survival of the fittest made famous by CharlesDarwin. Simply put, the algorithms exposed the entities to a fitness test thatdetermined the viability of offspring spawned by the parents. Often times, theproblem would be represented as a chromosome, which was mutated and perpetuatedmuch like happens in nature. So, to make a long and boring story more to thepoint, my idea was to simulate a genetic algorithm inside the cellular array ofa very large FPGA from Xilinx. The goal was to “evolve” the correctinterconnect structure within the cellular array based on some fitness test orconstraint irrespective of the inputs to the chip. This idea would have aninterest to anyone in the industry that understood the impossibility of knowinga priori what inputs or circumstances may be encountered by an entity in anunknown environment, like an unmanned Mars rover. Typically what is done inanticipation of as many of the circumstances that are known to occur and logicis created to deal with it, often times in the form of rules. In my researchcase, the circumstances of the environment need not be known, thus allowing theinputs to determine the internal structure of the device to optimally configureitself to provide the best possible fit for the life function test. In otherwords, the structure of the FPGA would be established based on its inputsproducing optimal function. Structure is function, literally in this case. Iwon’t get into any gory details about the algorithms or the chip architecture;just hold onto the idea of structure as function as we begin to relate thisconcept to Structural Integration, sometimes called Rolfing. This is a name Idadid not approve of [6]."},{"pageContent":"STRUCTURE IS FUNCTION AND ENERGYStructural Integration is a form of manipulative bodywork that focuses onaligning and relating the human body to the gravity field. This work wasinvented by Dr. Ida Rolf and is described in her book [6]. My son JJ, now 14years old, was born with a genetic disorder termed DiGeorge’s Syndrome. One ofthe symptoms he had was loose connective tissue, which made walking withoutbraces difficult for him, even at age 5. During a triathlon race in San Diegoin the year 2000, a fellow athlete told me about Structural Integration. IdaRolf had a child with polio which had incapacitated one leg. She discovered theRolf 10-series during her quest to find solutions to musculo-skeletal disordersas well as bringing significant attention to the populace pragmaticallyinvestigating and understanding the relationship between the human structure andthe gravity field. After reading Ida’s book and experiencing the work, Iattended the Guild for Structural Integration, Boulder Colorado, to become acertified Structural Integrator in the year 2004, in order to help my son JJwith the multitude of issues he has with his structure. I was in practicefull-time doing this work for almost seven years, and am still occasionallysharing the work with folks as the spirit moves me to do so. My wife Christa isalso a Structural Integrator. Our current focus is bringing this work tospecial needs children like my son JJ.So, how does Structural Integration (SI) relate to energy in the human body? Itwasn’t until I began to experience significant changes in my own body that Ibegan to ponder what the relationship between structure and function were inhumans and how it was related to energy [7]. Note that I slipped in the conceptof energy when dealing with humans as I had trouble with the idea of quantifyingfunction related to the affairs of man. Stated another way, how do you measurethe function of a human? Of course, one can compare performance in variousevents such as athletics to determine degrees of function but it did not seemsatisfying to me. As my body began to approach a more structured state, Inoticed that my sensitivity to energy became heightened. One day while spacingout during the auditor course in Hawaii 2003 (no offense to Jeff Linn, you werea terrific instructor), I asked, okay rudely blurted out the question to Jeffand the class “what is the relationship of structure to energy?” Everyone inthe class gave me a sideways glance to “take it off line bonehead,” so I did. While sitting in my room staring at the lagoon, it occurred to me that as anelectrical engineer, I understood the laws of physics but had never reallyapplied them to myself. Here comes the fun part of this paper! Stay with mejust a bit longer. So I asked myself, what is the energy of a human? My firstthoughts were of measuring the capacitance and voltage of a human body to get E.Actual measurements seemed like work and probably would not be helpful orrelevant. Besides I did not bring an oscilloscope to Hawaii, only a bike. Thisled me to generalize and borrow an Equation from someone much smarter than I,Albert Einstein. See Equation [EQ1] for his more notorious contribution to thefield of physics.EQ1 [../images/00014.jpeg]At least I had a starting place to think about. Wasthis the energy of a human? It seemed too succinct to make a difference to whatI was experiencing as a result of structure changes in my body brought about byRolfing. So I started goofing around with Equation [EQ1] in order to relate itmore to a human. We don’t often think in terms of mass on earth relative tohumans, but rather discuss the weight of an object. This led to Equation [2] inwhich incorporates gravity into Equation [EQ1] above.EQ2 [../images/00015.jpeg]In this Equation our obsession with the bathroomweight scale convinced me I was on the right track. Weight (W) on earth issimply computed by multiplying our mass (m) times the supposed accelerativeforce of gravity (g). Near the earth’s surface, gravity is often treated as aconstant. Simply rearranging Equation [EQ2] to isolate the mass and thensubstituting it into Equation 1 produces Equation [EQ3]. eq3 [../images/00016.jpeg]Now we are getting somewhere, at least gravity seemsnow to be related to the energy of a human. The next variable (some say it’s aconstant, not so) to work with to better understand what constitutes humanenergy, at least in terms of physical forces currently known to science, was thespeed of light, c. As my structure progressed toward a more vertical state, aninterest in Yoga developed, as it seemed logical as an organized stretchingregimen. The books on Yoga referenced nerve ganglia at various locations alongthe human spine that acted as conduits for, you guessed it, energy [8]. ButEquation [EQ3] above did not really help here so I decided to replace the speedof light with another substitution, namely Equation [EQ4] below:eq4 [../images/00017.jpeg]Equation [EQ4] indicates that the speed of light is afunction of the wavelength and frequency, lambda and nu respectively. Whenthinking of wavelength and frequency, an electrical engineer would oftenconsider an antenna design which would be constructed to tune in a certainfrequency, like an FM radio station in your car. The antenna structure isdesigned to tune in a specific frequency based on the wavelength for thetransmitted signal. The electromagnetic spectrum contains all wavelengths so Iwas somewhat at a loss as to how this could be narrowed and related to humans. It was clear to me that the electromagnetic spectrum, including those naturallyfound in our physical world as well as those generated by man were impacting allof us but how did this energy relate to Equation [EQ3]? Again, by simplesubstitution of Equation [EQ4] into [EQ3], we get Equation [EQ5]:eq5 [../images/00018.jpeg]So, now we have an Equation that relates gravity,weight, wavelength, and frequency to the maximum energy of humans. Forinstance, what about the weak and strong nuclear forces? Working with what wehave thus far, ignoring quantum physics, and using the analogy of the human bodyas an antenna, the 7 Chakras from Yoga began to make more sense to me whenconsidering each nerve ganglia along the spine as root nodes in a human antennathat could be tuning in some energy source (electromagnetism, gravity,photons?). Demons according to some Christians. I guess you have to be anengineer to think this way, sorry. Anyway, assuming that the nodes or Chakrasalong the human spine had something to do with wavelength and frequency I madethe assumption that maybe, just maybe, those nodes could act as the pointsbetween which some form of waveform could resonate at some frequency/wavelengthand amplitude. The distance between the nodes establishes the wavelength and thefrequency would naturally follow as it is related to wavelength using with thespeed of light as a constant scalar. So, could it be as the structure of ahuman changed, that various changes would occur regarding the wavelength andfrequency of the “energy that animates all matter”, including humans, sets up asequence of waves whose wavelength and frequency are controlled by the distanceand resistance between the nodes. See Figure 8 for a depiction of thenodes/Chakras referenced in the Sivananda Yoga Manual [8, pg. 69].[../images/00019.jpeg]Figure 8: Chakras as Antenna Nodes in the Human Body The distance between these nodes is not accurately depicted and probably variessignificantly when measurements are obtained from a human structure. This maybe a significant variable in computing the total energy E as shown in Equation[EQ5] above. Generalizing the Chakras as nodes in a human antenna design, onecould envision energy waves, electrical or chemical or a combination of one ormore, oscillating between the nodes. Since the Chakras contribute quantizedamounts, each wavelength and frequency portion from the seven chakras ismodified in [EQ5A]. This equation accounts for Chakras that may not becontribute to the whole, also allowing different wavelengths to be used inaccordance with the colors affiliated with the Chakras. See [EQ5A] below [../images/00020.jpeg]  [EQ5A]Where does the energy received by the “human antenna” come from? Some havereferred to this energy as Christ’s, Chi, Prana, or several other names fromdifferent cultures. I prefer to reference it as the “energy that animates allmatter.” Whatever nomenclature suits the reader, my assertion is that thisenergy has both wavelength and frequency and exists as a waveform between thenodes or nerve ganglia along the human spine, possibly elsewhere as well. Notethat energy need not travel optimally between nodes, affecting the maximumenergy obtainable, Emax. An analogy of a guitar string comes to mind. Think of a guitar that has astring, that when plucked, vibrates at a wavelength and frequency equal to thelow E note. When the string has the proper tension, it will ring true,otherwise it may have unwanted harmonics that tend to cause a dampening orringing that deviate from the desired note. Similarly, the connection betweenthe nodes of the Chakras may be acting analogous to a guitar string providing astructural basis for energy flow between the nodes with a given wavelength andfrequency, respectively. A possible difference being that the waveforms betweennodes are probably occurring in an aqueous medium like the cerebral spinal fluidversus those described in the guitar analogy. Figure 9 depicts a genericsinusoidal waveform with wavelength and frequency identified. Bear with theengineering mumbo jumbo just a bit longer. The frequency is determined by howfast the waveform completes a full cycle of2 in the interval between time t0and t1. [../images/00021.jpeg]Figure 9: Generic Waveform Parameters Now that the background primer on waveforms has been covered, what’s next? Well, there could be any number of waveforms oscillating between any of thenodes depicted in Figure 8. For example, suppose that between the MuladharaChakra and the Swadhisthana Chakra depicted in Figure 8, a waveform began tooscillate when the pelvis approached a more organized level. The Yoga traditionasserts that Prana or “the energy that animates all matter,” is a waveform thatnaturally migrates from the bottom node Chakra located at the base of the sacrumtraveling upwards. Another term used in Yoga is apana, which is the energy thatmoves down the Chakras toward the Muladhara Chakra. According to the Yogis,when this occurs, the Kundalini or potential energy awakens. Whether or notthis is an accurate depiction of the way energy travels between Chakra nodes isa research topic beyond the scope of this book. What is in scope is the ideathat multiple waveforms may be occurring between each of the nodes and acrossnodes setting up a complex pattern of overlapping waveforms each with a uniquewavelength and frequency. In some cases, waveforms can be additive if theirpeaks are coincident or in phase using the superposition principle (one of thoseyucky math things). Waveforms out of phase tend to dampen the resultantamplitude, which in our case affects the amount of energy in Equation [EQ5]. When waveforms are additive the energy increases by the square term. Likewise,when they are out of phase, the energy decreases. It would not be surprising tofind a relationship between brainwave activity and the structural integrity(distance and path resistance) of the Chakras. This is where StructuralIntegration can have a major impact on the energy state of a human as related tothe gravity field. In particular, structural organization changes the nodedistance and the viscosity of the interstitial fluid in the cells. To whatextent the cerebral spinal fluid viscosity may be altered is unknown. Usingsimple electrical principles, viscosity in a fluid medium would certainly changethe electrical current/voltage relationship as well, namelyV = I * R, or I = V/R. The less resistance (R) in the medium, the larger theelectron current flow would be. For instance, what happens to the frequency andwavelength between nodes when the space between the vertebrae of the human spinegets increased? Specifically, how do changes in node distance along the spinerelate to energy defined in Equation [EQ5A]? It is interesting to note thateach of the Chakras had a color associated with it. In the electromagneticspectrum, wavelengths of light are characterized by differences in color. Thecolors shown in Figure 8 were intended to depict this but it’s a bit difficultto differentiate in the drawing. A later Chakra diagram in Chapter 12 providesthis detail.Another ramification worth considering in Equation [EQ5/5A] is the extent towhich gravity must be considered a constant in the denominator. Let’s supposethat we take the limit as g approaches infinity. In this case, the energy Egoes to zero. See, Equation [EQ6]eq6 [../images/00022.jpeg]Is it any wonder that one gets tired when getting outof bed, placing the body vertically the gravitational field? It has little todo with having to go to work, I promise. Next, consider the limit as g goes tozero depicted in Equation [EQ7].eq7 [../images/00023.jpeg]In this case, I am floating around with infiniteenergy. This brings to bear the question regarding the effects of gravity onthe human structure. According to Ida Rolf, when structure is properlyorganized, the force of gravity augments human energy versus impeding it. Howcan this be? Simply looking at Equation [EQ5] and following the second limitscenario, e.g. the limit as g approaches zero, we see mathematically that energyE goes to infinity. Could she be right? What are the ramifications of thisoccurring? Is this the result of finding the highly sought after “line” inStructural Integration? If one takes Equation [EQ5] literally, then that is theobvious result. A more probably situation is to expect that people in generalare not operating in a manner such that gravity can be ignored. For example,suppose that a particular individual were about 80% efficient with their body inthe gravitational field. This would result in a modification to Equation [EQ5]as shown in Equation [EQ8].eq8 [../images/00024.jpeg]Equation [EQ8] states that the individual would experience less of the effectsof gravity on their mass thereby increasing the overall energy E. "},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONThe human body has functional analogies to a communications antenna. The humanantenna has a primitive intelligence that seeks to optimally tune itself towhat’s on the cosmic broadcast channel by aligning itself in the gravity field.Changes in structure, from direct experience, and from the description by othersexperiencing the same phenomenon, produce changes in human energy. Thesechanges are felt by the individual and are often characterized by changes inbehavior/personality. The individual experiences changes in energy not only interms of the potential to do more work or activities at a higher performancelevel, but the state change also appears to significantly alter individualperception and consciousness. These changes in energy/consciousness are verysimilar, if not the same, to those described by models posited by the Zen andYoga masters of old.Thus, it is the author’s assertion that the energy defined in Equation [EQ5] isthe maximum energy obtainable in humans given our knowledge of the physical lawscurrently operating in this order of reality. It seems old fashioned and quaintto think that we as humans are subject to the same simple Newtonian laws ofphysics as other material objects, but the model seems to work thus far. That’snot to say that quantum effects are not happening simultaneously as well, butthat’s a topic for another book. As for gravity, it is my assertion that it isnot just an accelerative force. This is easily demonstrated by the fact thatobjects falling in the earth’s atmosphere reach a terminal velocity. If gravitywere truly an accelerative force, then the objects would continue to acceleratetowards the earth instead of reaching steady state velocities. Fullyunderstanding gravity is a topic for future work but as physicists approach aunified theory linking the known forces together, our understanding increases. Knowing of the atomic expansion rate of all mater, as exhibited by gravity,should become mainstream in short order, probably after the academics admitMcCutcheon’s validity [28]. Suffice it to say, gravity plays an integral part inthe daily experience of humans as either augmenting or detracting from the totalenergy for us all. Gravity either supports human structure to achieve our humanpotential or gradually withers unstructured humans beneath its oppressive force[6]. An upright structure is righteous and energetic. Now that you are sitting up straight, various energyinteraction modalities can be analyzed as to their probable or measured impacton matter. Much is yet to be discovered about that actual interaction betweenthe electromagnetic spectrum and human beings. Energy can take many forms thataffects humans: thermal energy, radiation, sound-pressure waves, microwaves,X-Rays, etc. Figure 10 depicts the continuum of the Electromagnetic Spectrum. [../images/00025.jpeg]Figure 10: Electromagnetic SpectrumAdditionally, not all energy interacts with matter: it may be the case that acertain frequency passes right through the matter without effect. The energythat is absorbed into matter is what creates an interaction where theconservation of energy principles can be studied and understood. Energyinteracts with matter in various ways as shown in the Figure 11.Recently, as part of the research I was conducting as part of my StructuralIntegration practice, Resonant Field Imaging and Poly-Chromatic InterferencePhotography software tools, licensed through Dr. Harry Oldfield out of the U.K.were acquired. Using the RFI software, I can capture frequencies with ahand-held meter, displaying the Chakra frequency as a wavelength or colorprintout for the client. To make it easier than taking several frequencymeasurements, I also bought the PIP software that allows me to see this samedata using a high definition video camera. My research data working with SIclients using RFI and PIP will be published shortly. Preliminary resultsindicate that there is a strong correlation between the human structure and theresultant energy which is clearly distinguishable when recorded onto a computer,in full HD. How could this data be used? Give it some thought.radm [../images/00026.jpeg]Figure 11: Energy Interactions with Matter The Anunnaki appear to have had a much better understanding of this topic giventheir history and Galactic head start of at least 450,000 years.

The second area of interest is how the Anunnaki mayhave used their knowledge of the interaction between energy and matter toprolong their own lives or at the very least maintain their bodily state tominimize the effects of rapid aging that would most likely affect any being thatchanged physical locations in the galaxy subsequently experiencing differentplanetary orbital periods that govern local life cycles.

When a predator detects the sound of its preyduring a hunt, it is able to focus in and determine in which direction to lookfor the source of the sound. This ability to triangulate in on the source of aninteresting sound is not unique to animals, but people have this innate sensingability as well. Consider how easily we are able to detect when someone callsour name in the park, which direction sometimes more general than others, and aninitial estimate how close the person is. Following the auditory trigger, theentity changes its focus, re-orienting the visual system toward the source ofthe sound, thereby creating a whole new state of awareness formulated using thesynthesized input from both the auditory and visual systems.Thus, a spatially diverse audible or sub-audible signal, could be used to sendmessages over the electromagnetic spectrum directly to the slave’s RAS,essentially issuing a command within the beings biological mental control loop. When a command is received in this way, the being, especially one that is notself-conscious, would simply respond to the message in their mind “as if it wereits own thought” and act accordingly. Note that problems arise if the beingquestions the thoughts that are being “put in their head” or if they evolve tothe point that they are able to take responsibility for their actions for:Behavior is nothing more than a belated announcement of a previously acceptedthought as one’s own.So, assuming that a thought may be placed within the mental control loop of ahuman being, discounting the counteractive possibility of free-will, and thethought is accepted as one’s own, then a biological method for controllingslaves has been identified. Recall in the last chapter where the didgeridoo andits mind entraining power was briefly touched upon. How does a beat frequencyoscillation change the human brain, seemingly without the targeted being doinganything to help? How is this done? Modern science had discovered a phenomenonthat most likely explains the process by which sound, even inaudible, could beused to control a human being, especially one that is not responsible for thecontent of their own thoughts. The phenomenon is termed sound entrainment, aterm that was briefly described in the last chapter, and will be more thoroughlyinvestigated here as a potential methodology used by the Anunnaki to command andcontrol the slave workers. Consider a cat prowling around the garden, listening for any potential prey. Watch carefully, as the cat individually attunes its ears to the sounds, one ofwhich Fluffy hopes will be the source of its next meal. Cats have the abilityto aim their waveguides, e.g. attune their sonic listening devices to the soundsource, independently. This is part of how sound can be triangulated upon, anability that humans also possess, though not as keen. In the case of the cat, it is listening with two different sensors spatiallylocated some known distance apart, intentionally tuning its sensors on the sametarget to derive a location of the unsuspecting prey. The physical spacing ofthe receivers, in this case the cats ears, allows it to recover a signal andrecombine the two independent inputs to create a unique distance and directionmeasurement about the generating source noise. It is akin to polar coordinate,in which an azimuth and distal radius is used.When the cat’s ears receive the signals, given the fact that they are atslightly different locations, there is a path length difference from each ear tothe original source noise. When a signal arrives at the two points (ears) witha slight delay between them, the cats ears may hear the sound but something muchmore important happens within the cats brain to allow it to process thedifference in the arrival times of the two signals. This comparison of the twosignal arrival times produces a tangible delay value that can then be used alongwith an estimated distance and direction to the target augmented by the cat’svisual system.Similarly, bats transmit sonic radar pulses and receive them, process theinformation, and use it to navigate and hunt without sight, but using the sameprinciple inherent in spatial diversity and signal processing. This applicationof radar in nature among bats is termed echolocation. Echolocation has beendemonstrated to work with humans as well. The primitive ability to process the difference in sonic arrivaltimes is a survival attribute endemic in nature and also possessed by humans. Knowing this information could allow one to control an unsuspecting being usingsound entrainment. Essentially, two signals are combined to produce the sum anddifference of the originals. Suppose we have two frequencies, F1 and F2 thatare within the human auditor range 0-20kHz or so. Let F1 be 7 cycles per second(Hz) and let F2 be 4 Hz. If we were to combine F1 and F2, namely F1+F2 theresults would be two-fold. Let the outputs be F3 and F4. See Figure 12 for agraphical depiction for the frequency mixing operation.mixer [../images/00027.jpeg]Figure 12: Frequency Mixer What’s interesting about this phenomenon is that even if the ears are hearingthe sounds almost as the same in each ear, if the sum or addition of thesesignals falls within the human brain wave or EEG range, namely 0-20 Hz that thebrain waves of the recipient begin to correlate or entrain to the resultantsource signal. This entrainment is caused by the Reticular Activating Systemsynchronizing to the difference in sound and if done long enough, theelectroencephalograph (EEG) will show that the brain has synchronized to thereceived frequency, either F3 or F4 shown in Figure 12 above. A similar resonant example comes to mind in which a wine glass vibrates when acertain frequency is directed toward the glass causing it to resonate in concertwith the signal, and depending on the strength of the glass, may even shatterunder its own self-destructive response. So, one can see that a similarvibratory method could be found for humans, whom the Anunnaki most likelyutilized as part of their command, control, and communications decisions in theprimitive worker design constraints undertaken by Lord Enki. Thus, if thesource signal could be generated in a spatially diverse way such that theworkers were being communicated with directly to their RAS, they couldessentially have thoughts put in their heads while listening to music or thesignal could be communicated directly to the RAS within the receptive rangedirectly and at an amplitude that prevented other signals from being processed,e.g. jamming. Task masters could easily transmit signals in such a way that the RAS cannotprocess other inputs, ensuring that the commands from the masters were adheredto by the biological robots. It’s interesting to ponder what would happen to agroup of robots that were being mentally controlled by some frequency, thensuddenly, the source signal shuts off and their original biological controlmethods used prior to the alien intervention were allowed to re-formulate,defaulting to their internal control programming, factory default rules. Without the ability to record what happened to them in long-term memory therobots would go back to their original programs that were running prior to theoutside slave intervention. But if the slave workforce had intelligence and memory, then when the commandchannel ceased, the slaves would still have all the learned knowledge obtainedthrough the exposure to the tasks forced upon them; e.g. gold mining and citybuilding, in the case of the new primitive workers, to name a few. This freeingact; turning off or eliminating the slave control frequency, could trigger arobot rebellion. Thus having a failsafe slave command, control, andcommunication system to keep the primitive workers from revolting was tantamountto selling the concept to the Anunnaki council, a point no doubt accepted by allas Enki prevailed in the Council which subsequently permitted him to fashionprimitive workers to replace the Igigi slaves already in rebellion in theAfrican mines.Given what we know about the reticular activating system’s role in attentionfiltering and control, and that slowing down the mental processes occurs withmeditation disciplines, perhaps Alpha or Delta frequencies. Could it be that theslower brain frequency synchronizes with the reticular activation systemtriggering an energy flow through the spinal nerve ganglia that activates thepineal gland at the Crown chakra? With pineal gland activation via a kundalinienergy release, coincident with a blinding white light associated with reachingSamadhi or an equivalently termed blissful state, it is hypothesized that thepineal gland is triggered by either internal or external stimuli causing thegland to release DMT, the spirit molecule which has been shown to be presentduring mystical and euphoric states of mind [1].In general it is interesting to consider the effects of brain wave frequencychanges on various parts of the body, and the general effects they may have uponthe nervous system, and in particular on the pineal gland and its DMT productionas it relates to consciousness. "},{"pageContent":"THE PINEAL GLAND Another area of biology that the Anunnaki were focused on was the human pinealgland. Various rituals that were being performed by the Anunnaki targeted theactivation of the pineal gland. The question is, why were they interested inthis gland and did it have to do with slave control or biological longevity?Many spiritual disciplines describe psychedelic accounts of the transformativeexperiences, whose attainment motivate their practice. Blinding white light,encounters with demonic and angelic entities, ecstatic emotions, timelessness,heavenly sounds, feelings of having died and being reborn, contacting a powerfuland loving presence underlying all of reality-these experiences cut across alldenominations. They also are characteristic of a fully psychedelic DMTexperience [1, pg. 73]. Could meditation trigger the pineal DMT response? Yogic traditions often practice breathing techniques designed to bring about anintense fine-tuning of attention and awareness. The brain’s electricalactivity, as measured by the EEG, depicts this correlated breath and brain waveactivity.Religious and spiritual traditions from around the world are replete withdescriptions of a blinding white light that accompanies deep spiritualrealization. This “Enlightenment” usually is the result of a progression ofconsciousness though quantized steps, testing the individual’s psychological,and ethical development. Most mystical traditions describe the process and itsstages. It is interesting that in the Yogic tradition, the energy levels ateach Chakra establish the consciousness attainable, equating energy andconsciousness: a common connection in ancient cultures [1, pg. 58]In Judaism, for example, consciousness moved through the senior, or Kabbalisticcenters of spiritual development, the highest being Kester, or Crown. In theEastern Ayurveda tradition, these centers are called Chakras, and particularexperiences likewise accompany the movement of energy through them. The highestChakra is also called the Crown, or the Thousand-petaled Lotus. In bothtraditions, the location of this Crown sefira or chakra is the center and top ofthe skull, anatomically corresponding to the human pineal gland. Note that thethird eye is believed to more closely correspond with the pituitary gland [1,pg. 59].We first read about the physical pineal gland in the writings of Herophilus, athird-century B.C. Greek physician from the time of Alexander the Great. Itsname comes from the Latin pineus, relating to the pine, pinus. This littleorgan is thus piniform, or shaped like a pinecone, no bigger than the nail ofyour little finger.The pineal gland is unique in its solitary status within the brain. All otherbrain sites are paired, meaning that they have left and right counterparts. Asthe only unpaired organ deep within the brain, the pineal gland remained ananatomical curiosity for nearly two thousand years. No one in the West had anyidea what the pineal gland’s function was.Interest in the pineal grew once attracting the attention of Rene Descartes.This famous seventeenth-century French philosopher and mathematician, who said,“I think therefore I am,” needed a divine origin for those thoughts. Introspection showed him that it was possible to think only one thought at atime. From where in the brain might these unpaired, solitary thoughts arise? Descartes proposed that the pineal, the only singleton organ of the brain,generated thoughts. In addition, Descartes believed the pineal’s location,directly above one of the crucial byways for the cerebrospinal fluid, made thisfunction even more likely. Hollow cavities deep within the brain termed the ventricles, produce clear,salty, protein-rich cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid protects the brain bycushioning it from sudden jolts and bumps. It also carries nutrients to, andwaste products away from deep brain tissue.In Descartes’s view, the ebb and flow of the cerebrospinal fluid through theventricles seemed logical as the origin of thoughts. If the pineal gland“secreted” thoughts into the cerebrospinal fluid, what better means for the“stream of consciousness” to make its way to the rest of the brain [1, pg. 59]Descartes also had a deeply spiritual side believing that thinking was basicallya spiritual phenomenon made possible by our divine nature shared with theCreator. That is, our thoughts are expressions of, and proof for the existenceof, our soul. Descartes believed that the pineal gland played an essential rolein the expression of the soul.Descartes thus proposed that the pineal gland somehow was the “seat of thesoul.” The intermediary between the spiritual and physical. The body and thespirit met there, each affecting the other, and the repercussions extended inboth directions [1, pg. 60].Could Descartes be right? What do we know about the biology of the pineal glandand does it relate to the nature of spirit/energy? The pineal gland ofevolutionarily older animals, such as lizards and amphibians, is also called the“third” eye. Just like the two seeing eyes, the third eye possesses a lens,cornea, and retina and is light-sensitive. The pineal gland helps regulate bodytemperature and skin coloration-two basic reptilian survival functionsintimately related to environmental light. Melatonin, the primary pinealhormone, is present in primitive pineal glands. As animals climbed the evolutionary ladder, the pineal moved inward, deeper intothe brain, more hidden and removed from outside influences. While the birdpineal no longer sits on top of the skull, it remains sensitive to outside lightbecause of the paper-thin surrounding bones. The mammalian, including human,pineal is buried even deeper in the brain’s recesses and is not directlysensitive to light, at least in adults. It is interesting to speculate that asthe pineal assumes a more “spiritual” role, it needs the greater protection fromthe environment afforded by such deep placement in the skull.The human pineal gland becomes visible in the developing fetus at seven weeks,or forty-nine days, after conception. Of great interest is the fact thatcoincident with this time is exactly the time at which sexual differentiation isclearly detectable. Before this time the sex of the fetus is indeterminate, orunknown. Thus, the pineal gland and the most important differentiation ofhumanity, male and female gender, appear at the same time [1, pg. 61].For many years physiologists considered the mammalian pineal gland theequivalent of the “brains appendix.” It was a residual, vestigial organ, athrowback to our early reptilian days, with no known role. Functional rolesbegan to appear when American dermatologist Aaron Lerner discovered melatonin in1958. [1, pg. 62]The full name for Melatonin is N-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine. Note thatmelatonin is a tryptamine, just like di-methyl-tryptamine or DMT, a verypowerful hallucinogen. Noradrenalin and adrenaline are neurotransmitters thatcontrol melatonin production in the pineal gland. Only the adrenaline andnoradrenalin released by nearby pineal nerve ending have any effect on pinealfunction. It is strange that the pineal gland does not originate from brain tissue, andexists outside the blood-brain barrier. The gland should be seeminglyresponsive to blood-borne chemicals and drugs, but this is not the case as thepineal function is highly protected by the body. Blood-borne neurotransmitterssecreted into the blood never get to the pineal gland. Is it possible that melatonin could be the hormone responsible for the blindingwhite light mystical experiences aforementioned by Yogis which closely resembleda DMT trip? During an FDA facilitated DMT study by Dr. Strassman, a patient wasaccidently given a high dose of melatonin, the results of which prove that itwas not a psychoactive element much to the disappointment of the researchersconducting the study. The general hypothesis is that the pineal gland produces psychedelic amounts ofDMT, the most powerful hallucinogen known on earth, at extraordinary times inour lives [1, pg. 68] The DMT produced within the pineal is utilized within theconfines of the brain and is prevented from crossing over the blood-brainbarrier.When our individual life force enters our fetal body, the moment in which webecome truly human, it passes through the pineal and triggers the firstprimordial flood of DMT. Later at birth, the pineal releases more DMT. In someof us, pineal DMT mediates the pivotal experiences of deep meditation,psychosis, and near-death experiences. As we die, the life-force leaves thebody through the pineal gland, releasing another flood of their psychedelicspirit molecule. An interesting observation to note is the correlation between the TibetanBuddhist belief that the soul takes forty nine days after death to collectitself, assess the lessons of its past life, and then chose another [1, pg. 61].This time period matches exactly with two landmark events in the development ofthe fetus from conception: \"Forty-Nine is when the fetus differentiates intomale and female gender. It also takes forty-nine days from conception for thefirst signs of the human pineal to appear and show the presence of DMT.\" Thiscorrelation is significant in that the differentiation into male and femalegenders occurs biologically at the exact same time that pineal DMT becomesdetectable is more than just coincidence. Was this the 7 x 7 (49 days) neededfor Enki’s being to be infused with the energy that animates humans?"},{"pageContent":"PRESERVING ANUNNAKI LIFE: STARFIRE GOLDWith the biology primer on the pineal gland completed, now consider the ritualsthat were being performed in the Mesopotamian temples as it relates to evolvinghuman consciousness. Located within the temple of Hathor on Mt Sinai,archaeologist found a large quantity of a white talcum-like powder in a storagechamber beneath a stone in the floor. When analyzed, the white powder turnedout to be a by-product of gold processing, which was apparently being formulatedinto bread and consumed by the temple priests and ritual attendants. What then is it that can outweigh itself, but can also under weigh itself andbecome nothing? What then is it that can be gold, but can be turned to apowder? It is the stone of the hidden name, the shem-an-na, the “highwardfire-stone” which is none other than the Sumerian firestone of the MasterCraftsmen metallurgists [48, pg. 129]. The white powdered Starfire gold wasconsumed by high-ranking Anunnaki. They knew monoatomic elements like Starfiregold activated the pineal gland, subsequently producing DMT. Additionally, thisbodily energetic optimization facilitated the production of the enzymetelomerase, tempering the damage to telomeres during cell division. A solutionto the rapid aging process due to the short solar cycles on Earth had beenfound! Common reports from Strassman’s DMT patients was a feeling ofconnectedness with a sacred realm, perhaps another frequency dimension thatbecomes accessible when high levels of DMT exist in the brain. Clearly, for theconcoction to work, it had to affect the DNA strand integrity by preventing thetelomeres from decaying, as will be discussed in the next chapter. An addedhypothetical used for Starfire gold could have involved the intentionalenhancement of mental or telepathic communications, given the electromagnetic tochemical transduction function Dr. Strassman assigned to the Sprit Molecule,DMT. In layman’s terms, the DMT could convert the electromagnetic waves tothoughts and thoughts to an electromagnetic wave, like a Bluetooth short rangemodulator/demodulator (MODEM).Revisiting Exodus, we find a strange account in which Moses himself appears tohave the Starfire gold recipe, as he converts a golden statue into the elixir ofthe gods, forcing his followers to drink the DNA- altering solution. Was Mosesforcing the spiritually blind to experience the blinding white light of thepineal DMT release, although purportedly short-lived in its transformativeeffects? Exodus 32:19 (NIV)When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his angerburned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at thefoot of the mountain. 20 And he took the calf the people had made and burned itin the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made theIsraelites drink it. In Chapter 7 the reader will be transported from the realm of energy, matter,and brain science and follow the deeds of King Gilgamesh of the Mesopotamiancity of Uruk, as he sought a method to overcome his genetic trappings seekingeternal life given his Anunnaki blood lineage. Apparently he was notinfluential enough to obtain access to the exclusive Mount Sinai Hathor TempleClub, where they were regularly prolonging their lives smelting the gold theprimitive workers mined for them. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7: GILGAMESH, NOAH AND ETERNAL LIFE The Epic of Gilgamesh is deemed the longest and greatest literary compositionwritten in Akkadian cuneiform script. The narration follows the heroic king ofthe Sumerian city of Uruk, located in modern day southern Iraq. The heroic kingGilgamesh reached notoriety due to his worldwide recognizable theme: his famedquest for immortality. Kingship, the sole form of early governorship in Mesopotamia, was ordained bythe Anunnaki gods. Kings were considered to be great shepherds, maintainingorder, military leadership and security, and performing priestly functions suchas creating laws and conducting large scale building projects. Kings alsoserved as the liaison between the gods and the masses. Early kings were likelygenetic offspring of the Anunnaki, demigods being a hybrid mix between pureNiburian blood and the diluted genetics concocted for the slave species Adapa. According to the Sumerian King’s List, Lugalbanda called the “Shepherd King”,served for 1,200 years as the second king of Uruk. A mythological Sumerian textdescribes a romantic relationship between Lugalbanda and Ninsun, a full-bloodedAnunnaki female goddess. In the Gilgamesh and Huwawa tale, the hero consistentlyuses the phrase: “By the life of my own mother Ninsun and of my father, holyLugalbanda!” Thus, it is clear that king Gilgamesh had royal Anunnaki blood,three quarters pure to be more exact. Lugalbanda may have preceded Gilgamesh asking and father, but he was merely a human. Ninsun, being a full-bloodedAnunnaki female, would contribute mitochondrial DNA in addition to herreproductive material, making her offspring ¾ Anunnaki. This is the reasonbehind the Niburian inheritance rules predicating that the rightful heir isproduced from the father and his half-sister, perpetuating dominating effects ofmitochondrial DNA in the progeny. Table 5 below depicts the First Dynasty Kingsof Uruk. The lineage data shows that although Gilgamesh was King circa 2600 BCEand ruled for 126 years, he did not follow in direct succession after his fatherLugalbanda, but rather succeeded Dumuzi, a son of Enki.

Samples included tablets found in Megiddo written in Akkadian. Others were found in Emar on the mid-Euphrates. Versions were found in Akkadian,Hittite, and Hurrian languages discussed at Hattusa’s Hittite capital inNorthern Anatolia. Versions found in Nineveh in the seventh century were datedto a time during the Kassite Kingship of Senacherib. No one knows why the famous epic was written, but its introduction to thecontemporary gods of Mesopotamia coincides with the names used in the Atrahasis,including the major members of the Anunnaki Council: namely Enlil, Enki, andAnu. Gilgamesh’s heroic and emotion laden quest for eternal life, like hisAnunnaki ancestors possessed, appealed to audiences for centuries throughout theentire region. Gilgamesh knew as king that the humans created by Enki had alimited lifespan to only 120 years. The sensitive king anguished over the lossof life, and dreadfully feared his own death because of his genetic lack,although demigods like the lucky king lived far longer than 120 years, asevidenced by the long lives annotated in Genesis 4 and his many deeds in ancientMesopotamia. The Anunnaki were partaking of life prolonging Starfire gold to mitigate theeffects of the rapid solar cycles experienced on earth in order to prevent theirtelomeres from deteriorating [48, pg. 253]. Thus the Anunnaki appeared immortalto humans or to have everlasting life. The records do not indicate that kingGilgamesh was afforded the same life prolonging luxury. Gilgamesh knew thatbecause of his diluted Anunnaki blood that he would not be afforded the sameeternal lifespan of his mother Ninsun."},{"pageContent":"PRESS RELEASE NOBEL PRIZE 2009-10-05The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute has today decided to awardThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2009jointly toElizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostakfor the discovery of\"how chromosomes are protectedby telomeres and the enzyme telomerase\" Brief mention was published about the Nobel Prize winningscientists Blackburn, Greider and Szostak. Research on human chromosomes and theeffects that telomere deterioration, or lack thereof, has on human aging, wereawarded the Nobel Prize in the year 2009.The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to the scientists havingsolved a major problem in biology: how the chromosomes can be copied during celldivisions without suffering degradation. The Nobel Laureates found that theenzyme telomerase helps protect telomeres from aging.The long, thread-like DNA molecules that carry our genes are packed intochromosomes, the telomeres being the caps on their ends. Elizabeth Blackburn andJack Szostak discovered that a unique DNA sequence in the telomeres protects thechromosomes from degradation. Carol Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn identifiedtelomerase, the enzyme that makes telomere DNA. These discoveries explained howthe ends of the chromosomes are protected by the telomeres and that they arebuilt by telomerase.If the telomeres are shortened, cells age. Conversely, if telomerase activity ishigh, telomere length is maintained, and cellular damage is delayed. This is thecase in cancer cells, which can be considered to have eternal life. Certaininherited diseases, in contrast, are characterized by a defective telomerase,resulting in damaged cells. The award of the Nobel Prize recognizes thediscovery of a fundamental mechanism in the cell, a discovery that hasstimulated the development of new therapeutic strategies. Seems like ancientknowledge about anti-aging is just now being re-discovered. The Anunnakimention aging as a problem for them on Earth. They found solutions, theultimate being Starfire gold, reserved for the elite. It would be interestingto do a comparative study using modern medical techniques to determine theprecursors for telomerase as discussed in the 2009 Nobel Prize research."},{"pageContent":"GILGAMESH LONGS FOR ETERNAL LIFEBeing king has its perks. One of which, tantalizing as it must have been forGilgamesh, was having access to otherwise forbidden knowledge kept by the alienastronauts in his own backyard of Uruk. Inanna and Anu both had temples inUruk. The Anunnaki guarded the ME’s, which were reported to be 94 in totalcontaining, information for the ancient astronauts to roll out the full aspectsof civilizations on a remote planet. The knowledge stored on these ME tablets,most likely contained technical details about genetics and their link to whatseemed to be eternal life spans lived by the gods. The extent to which Gilgamesh knew about the role genetics played in long life,as witnessed by the longevity of the Anunnaki enshrined as gods and deified inMesopotamia, propelled him in the quest to obtain it for himself. Following thelast great deluge to hit Mesopotamia, of which there was more than one, Ziusudra(AKA Atrahasis/Noah) and his family landed on Mount Ararat aboard his famed ark,as instructed by his father Enki. Enlil, while soaring aloft along with severalother Anunnaki key figures surveying flood damage, spotted Ziusudra and his arkand was infuriated that one or more of the humans had survived the catastrophe.Later that evening, while conducting an offering at an impromptu altar he builtonsite, Ziusudra had an encounter with Enlil and Enki where the truth of hisbloodline is revealed. Enki admits that he is Ziusudra’s father, and that iswhy he saved him from the destructive deluge."},{"pageContent":"NOAH STILL ALIVE?It is during that encounter with Enlil, that Ziusudra, only 50% pure in hisAnunnaki lineage, was granted access to eternal life. The details of whattranspired on the mountain are not completely clear, but using the precedenceprovided in the Anunnaki writings, most likely involved a Council decision toprovide access to a specific “plant of life” for the transformed and newlyrenamed Anunnaki club member, Ut-napishtim. "},{"pageContent":"ADAPA VISITS ANU IN HEAVENWhen Dumuzi and Ningishzida escorted the Adapa to meet Anu in heaven/Nibiru [14,pg. 178], as part of the ritual encounter offered by a Niburian host, the breadof life and the elixir of life are offered by Anu but refused by the mortalslave Adapa in accordance with Enki’s wishes. These concoctions were more thanlikely devised to overcome the damage done to Anunnaki DNA eternallyperpetuating the biological renewal process. This telomere renewal processappears to have been replicated or re-engineered on Earth given the rapid agingdiscussed by the Anunnaki working the mines for long durations in Africa. Gilgamesh sought a plant of life that produced the same life-prolongingeffects. Having failed in his attempt to rendezvous with the gods spotted taking off andlanding their rockets on the massive stone platforms located at Baalbek, Lebanon[70], king Gilgamesh contrived a plan to find Enki’s son. Noah, AKA Ziusudra,was renamed Ut-napishtim following his changed longevity status and beingallowed into the “god’s private club” on Mount Ararat. If Gilgamesh could findthe king of Shuruppak, called Ziusudra to the Sumerians, Noah to the readers ofthe Canonical Bible, then he could find out the secret given to him by Enlilatop Mount Ararat and achieve eternal life for himself too. After all, Ziusudraonly had 50% pure blood and Gilgamesh had 75% pure Anunnaki lineage. Thus, itonly seemed right to Ninsun’s boy Gilgamesh that he should be entitled to thesame treatment. This is the catalyst for Gilgamesh’s epic tale and thebackground situation in Uruk approximately 2600 BCE. At the expense of doing injustice to the entire Epic, it will not be offered asa summarized tale beyond the analysis provided herein. Several printed andonline translations of the Epic of Gilgamesh are readily available to theresearcher. I have a friend whose fifth-grade child was attending a privateschool where I reside in San Diego, California. One of the reading assignmentsgiven to the youth enrolled over the summer session was the Epic of Gilgamesh,much to my surprise and amazement. Most Americans struggle to differentiateTurkey from Iraq geographically, none the less partake of classic Middle EasternLiterature like the one originating in the astounding culture of Sumeria, moderncivilization’s original genesis [41, 43]. It is no wonder parents want theirchildren educated in private schools where the NEA approved story of modernhistory is not passed through the editorial scruples of the government’s storytellers prior to landing on the public furnished desks at our kid’s neighborhoodschool."},{"pageContent":"GILGAMESH MEETS NOAHWith that said, king Gilgamesh finds the great flood exiled Ut-napishtim in hisquest and gets him to relate the details about the plant of life he seeks, whichis harvested in the shallow waters of the ocean. Epic of Gilgamesh, Tablet XI [37, pg. 109]Gilgamesh spoke to him, to Ut-napishtim, the far-distant.“I look at you, Ut-napishtimAnd your limbs are no different-you are just like me. Indeed, you are not at all different-you are just like me.I feel the urge to prove myself against you, to pick a fight.”Ut-napishtim spoke to him, to Gilgamesh,“Let me reveal to you a closely guarded matter, Gilgamesh,And let me tell you the secret of the gods.” From this point, the Biblical Noah tells Gilgamesh the full detailed accountingof what happened before, during, and after the great flood. Compare thisaccounting to that told in Genesis 7-9. Hmm, quite a different accounting of astory that was so important in the search for mankind’s true origins. Epic of Gilgamesh, Tablet XI [37, pg. 109]Shuruppak is a city that you yourself know,Situated on the bank of the Euphrates.That city was already old when the gods within itDecided that the great gods should make a flood.There was Anu their father,Warrior Ellil their counselor,Ninurta was their chamberlain,Ennugi their canal-controller,Far-sighted Ea swore the oath of secrecy with them.So he repeated their speech to a reed hut,“Reed hut, reed hut, brick wall, brick wall,Listen, reed hut and pay attention, brick wall:Man of Shuruppak, son of Ubara-Tutu,Dismantle your house, build a boat.Leave possessions, search out living things.Reject cattle and save lives!Put aboard the seed of all living things, into the boat.”(gap)I realized and spoke to my master Ea,“I have paid attention to the words that you spoke in this way,My master, and I shall act upon them.But how can I explain myself to the city, the men and the elders?”Ea (Enki) made his voice heard and spoke,He said to me, his servant,“You shall speak to them thus:I think that Ellil has rejected me,And so I cannot stay in your city,And I cannot set foot on Ellis’s land again.I must go down to the Apsu and stay with my master Ea.” The important point of this Tablet XI snippet, is to point out that Ut-napishtimattributes his fate to his father Enki who warned him of the upcoming flood andEnlil, for blessing him with eternal life. Ut-napishtim and the king of Uruk go on a hunt for the heralded plant of life,find it, and Gilgamesh heads home via the sea with his prize plant. Given thesymbols alluded to in the Epic, those officially ascribed to Enki, lord of thewaters, the plant is taken away from Gilgamesh, indicating Enki’s originalgenetic design constraining mankind to a finite life span, namely 120 years. Even though Gilgamesh was more than likely to live well beyond the mere mortallifespan cap, his destiny was not to be immortal like Noah and the gods. Asimilar hero of old, Alexander the Great of Macedonia, suffered the exact samedilemma and consequences as Gilgamesh. Both demigods perished here on earth,heroes of old, men of renown as described in the Hebrew edited version of theBible, New International Version. Genesis 6:4 (NIV)The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons ofGod went to the daughters of men and had had children by them. They were theheroes of old, the men of renown. Gilgamesh’s Mother, Ninsun, would be a terrific candidate to study for thegenealogy of the Anunnaki since she had a pure blood line. The mother of a heroof old, a king of great renown. Obviously, having knowledge about Gilgamesh’sgrave site makes one wonder where his DNA analysis report is filed and who hasaccess to it? See the press release published in 2003. A press release from theBBC is provided shortly. As for other deeds the hero Gilgamesh accomplished, also known as Nimrod in theBible, again from Genesis we have the following details: Genesis 10:8-12 (NIV)Cush was the father of Nimrod, who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth, Hewas a mighty hunter before the Lord; that is why it is said “like Nimrod, amighty hunter before the Lord.” The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon,Erech (Uruk), Akkad and Calneh, in Shinar (Sumer). From that land he went toAssyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah and Resen, which is betweenNineveh and Calah; that is the great city. Zecharia Sitchin dreamt of having an ancient astronaut’s body from Nibirugenetically analyzed, validating his hypothesis on the Sumerian gods, hopefullyin his lifetime. I was listening to a program via YouTube last week and heardan old pre-recorded program shown in which Zecharia Sitchin was beinginterviewed, and the aged and soft-spoken scholar mentioned on the Coast toCoast AM Radio program with George Noory, his expressed desire to see histheories validated with science correlating mankind’s missing link origins withthe archetypal entwined serpent strands of Anunnaki DNA. Perhaps the “junk”human DNA [86], of which approximately 95% of it has been deemed by science forlack of understanding, was part of the original Anunnaki DNA that had beeninactivated in the primitive workers. Comparing the original Anunnaki DNA withhuman DNA would most likely dispel any further reservations about the Anunnakigenesis for humanity’s creation. In my humble opinion, given the fact thatgrave sites have been unearthed and physical anthropology has been focused onthe Sumer region since the turn of the century, this DNA analysis has long beenaccomplished. The results of such a study would certainly be hidden knowledgefrom the masses. Saddam Hussein hired a team of German archeologists to find Gilgamesh’s grave inthe city of Uruk. The city was mapped using a magnetometer [68] as reported ina press release from the BBC April 2003 [74]. Gilgamesh Tomb Believed Found Story from BBC NEWS:http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/science/nature/2982891.stmPublished: 2003/04/29 07:57:11 GMTArchaeologists in Iraq believe they may have found the lost tomb of KingGilgamesh - the subject of the oldest \"book\" in history.The Epic Of Gilgamesh - written by a Middle Eastern scholar 2,500 years beforethe birth of Christ - commemorated the life of the ruler of the city of Uruk,from which Iraq gets its name.Now, a German-led expedition has discovered what is thought to be the entirecity of Uruk - including, where the Euphrates once flowed, the last restingplace of its famous King.\"I don't want to say definitely it was the grave of King Gilgamesh, but it looksvery similar to that described in the epic,\" Jorg Fassbinder, of the Bavariandepartment of Historical Monuments in Munich, told the BBC World Service'sScience in Action programme. MagneticIn the book - actually a set of inscribed clay tablets - Gilgamesh was describedas having been buried under the Euphrates, in a tomb apparently constructed whenthe waters of the ancient river parted following his death.\"We found just outside the city an area in the middle of the former EuphratesRiver, the remains of such a building which could be interpreted as a burial,\"Mr. Fassbinder said.He said the amazing discovery of the ancient city under the Iraqi desert hadbeen made possible by modern technology.\"By differences in magnetization in the soil, you can look into the ground,\" Mr.Fassbinder added.\"The difference between mud bricks and sediments in the Euphrates River gives avery detailed structure.\"This creates a magnetogram, which is then digitally mapped, effectively giving atown plan of Uruk.'Venice in the desert'\"The most surprising thing was that we found structures already described byGilgamesh,\" Mr. Fassbinder stated.\"We covered more than 100 hectares. We have found garden structures and fieldstructures as described in the epic, and we found Babylonian houses.\"But he said the most astonishing find was an incredibly sophisticated system ofcanals.\"Very clearly, we can see in the canals some structures showing that floodingdestroyed some houses, which means it was a highly developed system.\"[It was] like Venice in the desert.\" The temple complexes in Uruk were specified as the Eanna District and the AnuDistrict, both of which were dedicated to the Anunnaki gods and Council membersInanna and Anu, respectively. The Anu District dates back to the times of Eridu,considered to be one of the oldest and most important cities of Sumer. Templesserved both an important religious function and state functions. Gilgamesh’sdirect knowledge and interaction with the likes of Inanna and Anu make the storyeven more compelling. These are not conjured up gods, but living beings thatregularly visit Uruk and take residence in their impressive temples therein. Saddam Hussein’s interest in rebuilding Babylon, Marduk’s gateway of the gods,was supposedly driven by his belief that he was a reincarnation ofNebuchadnezzar [75]. Also, he hired a team of Germans to run a magnetometer overthe ancient site of Uruk, during the first Gulf war in 1991. In order to gainaccess to the site, a massive bypass canal was built to divert the water wherethe famous reeds grew, away from the Uruk area. This dried up the regionallowing easy archeological access. This domestic archeological diggingactivity seemed somewhat crazy to be focused on while being overthrown by theworld’s most powerful military, the United States of America? An independent archaeologist that discussed a direct link between the ancient ETpresence in Sumer and the US focus on the regime of Saddam Hussein, is WilliamHenry. Henry's main thesis was that there existed in Sumerian times a Stargate,used by the Anunnaki/Nephilim to travel back and forth between Nibiru and theEarth [53]. Henry focuses on the following scene described by Sitchin'sinterpretation of a cuneiform tablet of an Uruk ritual text:“Depictions have been found that show divine beings flanking a temple entranceand holding up poles to which ring-like objects are attached. The celestialnature of the scene is indicated by the inclusion of the symbols of the Sun andthe Moon.... depicting Enlil and Enki flanking a gateway through which Anu ismaking a grand entrance.”Rather than a simple temple scene involving the chief Anunnaki of the Sumerians,Anu and his two sons, Enlil and Enki, Henry proposes that the above scenerepresents a transportation device used by Anu and others from the eliteAnunnaki. If so, then such a device is most likely located in the Sumerian cityof Uruk [75], which was the founding city of the Sumerian civilization, and thehome of Gilgamesh, the famed king of the Epic of Gilgamesh. Could this explainSaddam Hussein’s interest in mapping out the city of Uruk? Saddam’s secretagenda involving Sumerian artifacts died with him, and we may never know thetruth, lest Anu or some other high ranking Anunnaki re-activates the portal inUruk or Jerusalem with news media crews present, and introduces themselves tothe world via some talk show program on television.

It should be clear to peoples of the world that modern governments do not wantthe evolution of human consciousness to occur; and especially not the extensionof one’s life: This negative disposition between the governors and the serfsoriginated with Enlil. Evidence abounds in the world’s cultures that perpetuatechemical enslavement abiding by government established mores; the latest ofwhich involves the likes of Monsanto and its team of lawyers accosting theworld’s food supply with genetically modified foods/organisms (GMO) shown tocause significant harm in a recent finding involving pigs, whose digestive tractis quite similar to humans. According to the study, researchers found astatistically significant increase in severe stomach inflammation; about 2.5times higher in the pigs that were fed the engineered grains compared to thenon-engineered grains. Additionally, the weight of a pig's uterus was 25 percentlarger for GM-fed pigs, an issue which can lead to problems with a pig'sreproductive or hormonal system, said Michael Hansen, Consumer's Union SeniorStaff scientist [110]. The next section details some of the modern chemicalshumans have a close relationship to, helping governments around the world keephuman consciousness suppressed to its lowest Root Chakra level. For a goodlaugh, consider watching the movie “Idiocracy”, a 2006 satirical science fictioncomedy that makes fun of the human mob, crawling beneath the rotting seats atthe lowest level of human existence, worse than Plato’s allegorical projectionon the “he said, she said” cave wall. You will laugh, and nod your head inconciliatory cultural disgust."},{"pageContent":"ENSLAVEMENT TECHNIQUESMethods used by the Ancient gods and modern governments to enslave mankind aremany. Slavery imposed upon the primitive workers was done readily achievedusing in-vitro fertilization: mixing Enki’s DNA with the female zygote of aprimitive bi-pedal hominid, found roaming the plains of South Africaapproximately 200,000 years ago. Aside from the physical suppression ofconsciousness by anatomically modern human genetic craftsmen, other means forcontrolling the growing world’s population would be necessary as the tenets ofcivilization were slowly introduced to mankind by the Anunnaki. Theinstructions for seeding new civilizations on alien planets existed, accordingto the Sumerian texts, in the form of tablets or information disks simplyreferred to in the texts as ME’s, of which there were a total of 94. These“recipe disks” containing the details for implementing components ofcivilization were kept by Enki personally, either in his cult center temple inEridu or in Southeastern Africa where his mining headquarters was established."},{"pageContent":"ECONOMIC ENSLAVEMENTSuppose there were a population of primitive workers that the Anunnaki haddecided to introduce to the usury system, initially needed for ancient trade,marriage records, and general accounting techniques. Further suppose that thegenetic capabilities available to the primitive workers was originally quitepure and was tailored genetically to produce a specific functional capabilitysuch as procedural knowledge specific to the acts of mining and temple andcity-building. A major concern would be to get the primitive workers to dosomewhat sophisticated work while at the same time suppressing the behavior orpropensity to revolt after enduring extreme hard labor.It should be obvious to the casual observer that economic disparity is afunction of the capabilities of the individual relative to a usury system thathighly values and rewards certain capabilities while at the same time providingonly a meager existence to those that do not have the desired skills or goods. An example in our modern society is offered. Consider the economic earningdifference that exists between Nobel Prize winning scientists and someone thathas a learning disability that precludes them from attending a higher learninginstitute. The former may earn many times more than their strugglingcounterpart. Many such instances can be imagined across a spectrum ofvignettes. The issue at hand is the unfairness of the economic system thatbases one’s earning potential to a large part on genetics, not to overlook theenvironment as a contributing factor as well. The usury system could only beconsidered fair if all men were truly created equal, which is not the case atall. If one doubts this statement, compare the wages earned for highlytechnical workers like engineers, scientists, and computer programmer with theearning potential of laborers in the fast food industry. News media reportsthat these workers are joining unions and striking in massive numbers due to thefact that they cannot earn a living wage in the fast food business. We may beborn with the notion of equal access to opportunity in society, but not equalintellect or innate abilities to access it. Would the likes of Einstein’sintellect be equivalent to that of a common factory worker? Of course not, andthe ability to earn an equal income in a usury system that assumes that bymerely having “equal access to opportunities” makes the system fair is absurd. In large part, due to the innate differences in ability, the majority of thosein society are essentially relegated to economic slavery, disguised as a freesystem. A working class individual that must rely on the usury system to payfor housing, food, clothing, and medical care, often lives from paycheck topaycheck unable to save money and work their way out of the economic trap. Ifthe commoner is focused on making a living to simply survive in the system, thelikelihood of working toward an elevated consciousness, considered dangerous bythe ruling class, is practically null and void. Traditionally, the source ofdissidents and uprisings comes from the highly educated and not from the classof economic slaves. Although hard labor and difficult toil has been the basisof physical mutiny against the immediate enslavers, the ability to organize andincite a large group to action has historically eluded the pauper enslaved classThroughout history ruling class tactics have used a multitude of control methodsto prevent “mob uprisings”, a noteworthy advisor to kings was Machiavelli, whoauthored “The Prince”, a series of advice-lessons provided to French rulers asregarding interactions of a ruler with his followers. Later civilizationsadopted alternative methods to keep the mob at bay. One such method used inRome was to pacify the mob by entertaining them: a continuous calendar ofevents scheduled in the now infamous Coliseum to provide a passive outlet forpent up frustrations that otherwise would surface and be directed towards theruling class. Free entertainment surely is alluring, but other methods exist atvarious levels in a society designed to ensure compliance with ruling classmores or laws. Terrence McKenna, in his book Food of the Gods [4] discusseschemicals that were supported in early trade routes throughout the world thatpopulations found irresistible and rulers appreciated as the chemical substanceshad suppressive or dulling effects on human consciousness. Alternativeconsciousness suppression techniques included modern approaches to the energyand matter interactions discussed in Chapter 6; specifically the effects ELF canhave on controlling the human mind. "},{"pageContent":"CONSCIOUS SUPPRESSING CHEMICALSThe ways in which humans use plants, foods, and drugs causes the values ofindividuals and, ultimately, whole societies to shift. Eating some foods makesfolks happy while eating others makes one sleepy, and still others causealertness. Society encourages consumption of substances by the population thatproduce acceptable behavior. “Like fish in water, people in a culture swim in the virtually invisible mediumof culturally sanctioned yet artificial states of mind.” [4] This hidden yetpowerful chemical dependency was promoted if the effects of the substance madesubjects happy and more controllable, otherwise the substances were made illegalby the ruling class. Examples include hallucinogens such as mushrooms thatcontain psilocybin, potentially causing primitive workers to become aware oftheir own nakedness upon consumption?As sugar and other spices found their way into the trade routes that servedEuropeans, having endured a dismal and boring existence sans lavish colors andvariety, the Middle Ages were brought to an end. Christian medieval Europebroke up as a result of the consciousness expanding chemicals that entered themarket: coffee, opium dyes, silks, and rare gems were put on display in thepublic forum. The new trade goods were exotic and delightful. Sugar,chocolate, tea and coffee, and distilled alcohol survive to this day as staplesof the modern world. Our global trading market was created to cater tosociety’s need for variety and stimulation, especially when it comes to food. One particular drug that found ready acceptance in medieval Europe was canesugar [4]. The Romans favored sugar but knew that the bamboo-like grass from which sugarwas refined grew only in tropical regions, making it a rare and importedcommodity. Sugar beets were encouraged by Napoleon I as an alternative to thehard to get cane sugar. Sugar abuse is the world’s least discussed and most widespread addiction [4]. Sugar, as with all stimulants, causes a brief euphoric rush that is shortlyfollowed by depression, guilt, and usually an upset stomach if the individualquantity threshold is exceeded. Sugar abuse is often correlated with seriousalcohol consumption. Sugar and slavery are also closely related. Sugar canegrew in tropical regions and had to be imported, which led to brutalkidnappings, forced transporting, and mass murder of huge populations enslavedby merchants to support the addictive and growing demand for cane sugar. The use of tobacco in Europe in the sixteenth century has been perpetuated on aglobal scale, although smoking tobacco in the form of cigarettes in the UnitedStates, especially in coastal health conscious areas, has been the target ofgovernment sponsored negative advertising campaigns and has been banned in manypublic places. Developing nations and those on various trajectories along theindustrialization curve are the heaviest tobacco users. With the arrival of Europeans, tobacco became one of the primary productsfueling the colonization of the future American South, long before the creationof the United States. The initial colonial expansion, fueled by the desire toincrease tobacco production, was one cause of the first colonial conflicts withNative Americans and became a driving factor for the use of African slavelabor. Nothing complements a good smoke like a hard shot to wash down the tarand nicotine. Next we will look at alcohol’s effects on human consciousness.Alcohol may be responsible for suppressing inhibitions leading to more dynamic human interactions at the local pub, but it is not likely to be associated withelevation of consciousness any time soon, nor was it deemed so in the distantpast [95-107]. The effects of alcohol vary from person to person and withdifferent amounts. The number of drinks that constitute being “drunk” for oneperson may have little effect on another. Also varying are the changes inbehavior that one undergoes when under the influence of alcohol. A person maybehave in a way that is quite unlike their usual personality. For instance,someone who is normally calm and collected may become easily enraged and upsetor vice versa. Sometimes the effects of alcohol consumption are more subtle. Someone may simply become quiet and withdrawn. Often these changes are notnecessarily dangerous or problematic, but there are times when they certainlycan be. Some of the more serious changes in behavior may include violenttendencies, inability to make good or safe decisions, or lack of use ofprotection when engaging in sexual encounters. People often drink to relax, to gain confidence, or to be at ease in socialsituations [96]. Studies show that alcohol intoxication can make us aggressive[106,107]; it can relieve stressful anxiety and tension yet also increase themboth; it can inflate our egos yet lead to “crying-in-one’s beer” depression[97].Every time alcohol is consumed, in every person, perception and thought aregenerally impaired [99]. Research has shown that alcohol intoxication impairsnearly every aspect of information processing: the ability to abstract andconceptualize, the ability to encode large numbers of situational cues, theability to use several cues at the same time, the use of the active andsystematic encoding strategies, and the cognitive elaboration needed to encodemeaning from incoming information. Alcohol dulls the senses preventing one fromusing sensory cues to initiate a proper response, which could be fatal undercertain circumstances like drinking and driving.The consumption of alcohol may radically alter both one’s ability and one’smotivation to process information regarding sexual risk. Alcohol intoxicationcan decrease one’s ability to consider the consequences of their actions and itcan also lower inhibitions about sexual behaviors. Often times, alcohol playsthe role of scapegoat, as irresponsible actions can be blamed on the amount ofalcohol that was consumed.In general, studies have shown that people who regularly consume alcohol or usedrugs are more likely to engage in high-risk sexual behavior. Leigh andMorrison (1991) report that 50% of both male and female adolescents had beendrinking at the time of their first sexual experience. Alcohol intoxication atthe time of first sexual intercourse is associated with a decrease in condom use[100]. Under the influence of alcohol, people often make the poor decision toengage in sexual activity with someone they may not know and then make the evenworse decision not to use protection [101]. The basic effects of alcohol on thehuman awareness and behavior are clearly not conducive to an elevatedconsciousness. Other substances that made their way into civilizations via trade merchantsrecognizing a societal need or want and filling it. The point that needs to bemade is that the chemicals and substances that were allowed to stay incirculation in societies were either approved or denied by the ruling powers,with consciousness suppression being a foremost goal. Of particular concern toall ruling classes is the potential for an uprising or revolt against thegovernment. With this potential threat foremost in mind, it was and still isimperative to pay particular heed to the chemicals that the population isconsuming. The ideal substance that a ruler would gladly support is one that relegates thepopulation loyal to the ruler, suppresses the urge to revolt even under the mostdifficult circumstances, and at the same time keeps the subject at a functionallevel for the tasks assigned. The quintessential consumable substance is onethat prevents the ruler’s subject from “waking up” to the degree to which theruling class is exploiting the commoner for his own gain, as is common practicein master-slave relationships both individually and within larger societalsettings. Thus, it is to be expected to see substances in circulation thatsuppress human consciousness, while at the same time outlawing those thatelevate consciousness. Sugar, tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine are all prevalentin modern societies, while substances that were traditionally used by NativeAmericans to elevate-shift consciousness such as mushrooms, peyote, and cannabisare outlawed in the United States today. Some states provide means for societalmembers to access these substances for medicinal or spiritual purposes, butthese are only exceptions to the existing laws that generally outlaw their useby people."},{"pageContent":"HUMAN STRUCTURE AND CONSCIOUSNESSThe structural state for most human beings, beginning at birth and continuingthroughout the remainder of their life, is definitely a fallen state. Considerthe evolutionary path anatomically modern humans have traversed. Our firstbipedal ancestors appear to have transitioned from walking on all fours to amore or less upright stance approximately 3.5 million years ago given the stateof our current knowledge in the field of physical anthropology. What is meantby the assertion that humans are structurally in a fallen state? And what couldthat “fallen state” possibly have to do with consciousness? Structural Integration models the human body as a series of blocksthat must stack upon each other in the gravitational field in such a way thatthere is balance [117]. A working model of the human structure can bedelineated accordingly. Beginning from the ground, blocks representing variousparts of the body can be represented as stacked one on top of the other. Thefeet, legs, pelvis, torso, neck, and head are sufficient stackable blockrepresentations to demonstrate the point asserted above that most humans areunstructured. Structural integrators use various lines and planes to assess thedegree to which the human body is structured in the gravitational field. A very useful line used to assess human structure, as viewed from the side whilestanding, begins at the opening of the ear, passes through the shoulder and thenthe hip socket, progresses to the knee and finally ends at the ankle bone on theoutside of the leg. See Figure 13, leftmost image. For those more inclined touse Latin, the line extends from the Auditory Miatus to the Glenoid Fossa to theAcetabulum to the Fibular head and finally to the Lateral Malleolus. Note thatthe line only passes through bone at the top of the head, passing through thecenter of gravity behind the pubic bone in the pelvis. In order for a human tobe able to stand in a relaxed state and have the aforementioned blocks alignedis a very rare occurrence indeed. For that matter, over time, the humanstructure exposed to the gravitational field tends to deviate further andfurther from the imaginary line as described. See Figure 13 for some commonhuman structural patterns.posture [../images/00028.jpeg]Figure 13: Human Structural Patterns It’s as if the human structure has not evolved far enough to findthe gravitational balance point while standing. There are key areas of the bodythat tend to deter the ability to find this balanced state. Some of the keylocations that affect the body’s ability to find the vertical line are theCalcaneus or heel, the crest of the Ilium, and the Occipital muscles located atthe back of the cranium. Consider that at birth there are tissuedisorganizations at these locations that prevent the bony structure fromrelaxing and aligning with gravity. This is precisely the case in most humansat this present state of evolution having 1st hand knowledge with clients. Frombirth, if the crest of the Ilium has fascial attachments that prevent the pelvisfrom being horizontal, rest assured that as the baby transitions from crawlingto standing that the pelvis will most likely have an anterior tilt, which is themost common condition found among humans by structural integrators. If thepelvic block is tilted, even slightly anterior, then the blocks above the pelviswill have to adjust to keep the blocks stacked in the very strong gravitationalfield. To counter balance a tilted pelvis, the torso and head blocks in ourmodel will adjust to compensate for the pelvis. Over time, one can expect tosee an anterior head carry when referencing the Auditory Meatus (ear opening) tothe Glenoid Fossa otherwise known as the shoulder joint. In time, the anteriorhead position will stress the upper back muscles, in particular the Trapezoidsand the Rhomboids, leading eventually to a kyphotic hump at cervical vertebraeseven (C7). There are other unstructured patterns that emerge based on thedegree of fascial disorganization at the occipitals and Calcaneus. The point of this foray into human structure is to bring awarenessto the fallen state of human matter relative to the gravitational field. Sowhat is the effect of an unstructured body? This is where practitioners of yogaand other disciplines like Tai Chi have an experiential understanding of theimportance of synchronizing and balancing the human structure in thegravitational field. Through the process of re-ordering the human structure,practitioners realize empirically that the structural body state has a directcorrelation with energy and consciousness. Strength, balance, flexibility, andconsciousness are very much a function of proper structure. It is thus assertedthat most ordinary people that have not taken definitive steps to synchronizetheir bodies within the powerful gravitational field are most likely having orwill have pain in their bodies due to an ever-increasing unstructured state. Failing to synchronize the body with the strong gravity field creates a physicallimitation preventing the integration of energy and matter-handicapping theindividual’s ability to reach higher consciousness states.This slow-motion hardening of the fascia state occurs naturally, withoutimposing the compounding effects of accidents and poor posture. By the time achild has reached the age of seven or so, sans structural intervention, he orshe will not be able to abide by their parental prodding to sit up straight. Additionally, without proper parental or structural guidance to plant the SacralIschial Tuberosities (SITS bones) located at the inferior points of the pelvison the sitting surface, the child will not find balance sitting and will furtherexacerbate the structural disorder emanating from the all-important pelvis. In other words, unless a child is taught how to sit correctly early on, assuminga perfect structure to work with, he or she will cause further disorder amongthe stacked blocks by excessive and improper sitting habits. Gravity alwayswins this structural battle with the human body. Seeing this fallen conditionfrom a structural standpoint, among the human population at large, isdebilitating at best and tragic in its effects on human consciousness whichcannot progress beyond what the body’s structure allows. An analogy of theunstructured human body to a broken radio antenna is conjured up in the author’smind. If economic disparity, addictive chemical staple substances, andunstructured bodies are not enough to suppress human consciousness on a grandscale, then active interference in the brain using targeted frequencies byrepressive governments may be just what doctor Frankenstein ordered."},{"pageContent":"FREQUENCY CONTROLBiological components of the human brain that are susceptible to theelectromagnetic spectrum as previously detailed. As discussed in Chapter 5, thereticular activating system (RAS), an organ within the human brain, isresponsible for focusing attention. It is well know that the human brainregisters frequencies in the range 0-20 Hz as recorded and displayed on medicaldevices such as the electroencephalogram (EEG). The question raised for the reader’s consideration is this: what happens to thehuman brain, and in particular the RAS, when exposed to external frequenciesthat fall within this EEG range? Additionally, can information be modulatedonto the external frequency that is demodulated biologically by humans, therebyplacing “subconscious thoughts” within the human mind? An analogous situationoccurs in time of war dealing with enemy use of the electromagnetic spectrum. Battlefield tactics involving radio and navigation equipment are oftensubversive in nature. For instance, a pilot patrolling a border region may relyon the aircraft instruments to determine the location of friendly beaconslocated within the borders of the patrolled country. The enemy may desire todraw the pilot across the border so that an engagement may take place withoutviolating international laws by shooting across the border. One way to do thisis to use a false frequency originating from across the border to trick thepilot into believing that the navigation device or beacon is friendly. This canbe accomplished by methods of meaconing, intrusion, jamming, or interference. Meaconing is the use of a false beacon to fool the enemy into a false sense ofsecurity relying on the aircraft instruments, picking up a signal at the samefrequency as the actual friendly beacon, but at a high enough intensity to jamthe original signal that may be many miles away. Intrusion is a subversivefrequency tactic to place false information on a friendly net. Jamming is amethod whereby the foe’s communication channel is overridden by a higherintensity frequency originating from the enemy. An abbreviated version oftotally jamming a channel is to do it intermittently, interfering at criticalcommunication junctures to disrupt the flow of information, normally during abattle sequence. These methods work very well against radio and navigationequipment, so what are the effects of using these subversive electromagnetictactics against the human brain? Believe it or not, the government of theUnited States has such a program and has built antennae networks in America toaffect human consciousness on a massive scale."},{"pageContent":"HAARPThe U.S. Senate funded an ongoing project called the High frequency ActiveAuroral Research Program otherwise known as HAARP. The stated goal for theHAARP program is to further advance knowledge of the physical and electricalproperties of the Earth's ionosphere, which according to information from theofficial website (http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/) can affect military and civiliancommunication and navigation systems. The HAARP program operates a world-classionospheric research facility located in Gakona, Alaska. HAARP is jointlymanaged by the U.S. Air Force Phillips Laboratory, whose Geophysics Directorateis located at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, and two Navy organizationsin the District of Columbia: the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the NavalResearch Laboratory (NRL). Although HAARP is funded through the DOD, civilianand university researchers have conducted research using the system. The HAARP complex consists of 180 antenna towers configured in a grid of 15columns and 12 rows spread across 58 acres of Alaskan wilderness land. Thesystem is capable of transmitting 3.6 million watts of RF power and has apatented method for combining the energy in a focal beam array that is 72,000times more powerful than the largest commercial radio station in the UnitedStates. Construction was completed, although the antennae array is scalable inthe event more power is needed, in the year 2002. Antennae dipoles can operatein various frequency ranges [84]. Figure 14 depicts the HAARP antenna arrayfrom an aerial viewpoint. [../images/00029.jpeg]Figure 14: HAARP Antenna Array The HAARP project has configured an array of transmitters that emit sufficientsignal strength to turn the aurora borealis into a virtual antenna,re-broadcasting in the extreme low frequency (ELF) range. Note that the ELFfrequency range 6-10 Hz had been shown by David S. Walonick in his article“Effects of 6-10Hz ELF on Brain Waves” to have an effect on humans at thecellular level. EEG readings for the human brain operate in the range 0-20Hz orso. Thus, broadcasting using the HAARP antenna array minimally coincides withthe biological frequency occurring in the human brain. What could a nation orarmy do with such a system? Imagine being able use HAARP as a weapon tobroadcast with sufficient energy and in the proper frequency range, targetingopposing forces, cities, or entire continents. Given the sponsorship by thedepartment of defense, who owns the land and sponsors the program, HAARP used asa weapons has the ability to “fry” a human brain, much like theultra-high-frequency antennas mounted on modern military vehicles and aircraftcan do today. The system works by directing a transmitted ELF signal into thereflective ionosphere and bouncing the signal back to earth. During active ionospheric research, the signal generated by the transmittersystem is delivered to the antenna array, transmitted in an upward direction,and is partially absorbed, at an altitude between 100 to 350 km (depending onoperating frequency), in a small volume a few hundred meters thick and a fewtens of kilometers in diameter over the site. The intensity of the HF signal inthe ionosphere is less than 3 microwatts per cm2, tens of thousands of timesless than the Sun's natural electromagnetic radiation reaching the earth andhundreds of times less than even the normal random variations in intensity ofthe Sun's natural ultraviolet (UV) energy which creates the ionosphere. Thesmall effects that are produced, however, can be observed with the sensitivescientific instruments installed at the HAARP facility and these observationscan provide new information about the dynamics of plasmas and new insight intothe processes of solar-terrestrial interactions [84, 85].Since October 1976, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has beenemitting ELF signals from Tesla-type transmitters. Source frequencies coincideexactly with brain-wave rhythms that have been shown to cause depression andirritability in humans. The signals emanating from Russia have been analyzedby the EPA and found to produce psychological-psychoactive responses inhumans. The same ELF signals were also shown to be absorbed and re-radiated by60Hz power transmission wires among other structures common to industrializednations85. The point being that brain entrainment is known to occur as aresult of external stimulation by electro-magnetic means, subsequently changingthe brain waves to synchronize with the source ELF signal. The entrainmentresponse causes changes in brain waves leading to altered chemistry andsubsequent alteration in thoughts, emotions, and physical conditions. This isthe basic mechanism by which an individual or population can be subjected tointra-cerebral mind control [85]. Various control and enslavement methods have been introduced in this chapterthat is designed by governments to control their subjects. Methods ranging fromchemical dependency, economic enslavement, structural disintegration, and activetampering with mental functions using external frequency entrainment all operatein coincidence to suppress human consciousness perpetuated by the rulingclass. Humans for the most part are unwary victims of the degree to which theyhave been controlled while at the same time purported to have freedom but infact it is basically an illusion."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9: THE WINGED-DISC GOD OF ZOROASTERIn the eastern part of ancient Persia over a thousand years BCE a religiousphilosopher named Zoroaster simplified the pantheon of early Iranian gods intotwo opposing forces: Ahura Mazda (Illuminating Wisdom) and Angra Mainyu(Destructive Spirit) which were in conflict.Zoroaster's ideas led to a formal religion bearing his name by about the 6thcentury BCE and have influenced other later religions including Judaism,Gnosticism, Christianity and Islam.Ancient inscriptions on the cliffs of Behistun in modern day Iran, are shown inFigure 15 depicting the deity Ahura Mazda flying in his winged-disc over kingDarius I. This is the same symbol used by Enki in the flying disc symbol on theOld Persian capital of Persepolis. [../images/00030.jpeg]Figure 15: Behistun Inscription According to Wikipedia sources, the inscription was authored by Darius the Greatsometime between his coronation as king of the Persian Empire in the summer of522 BC and his death in autumn of 486 BC. The inscription begins with a briefautobiography of Darius, including his ancestry and lineage. Later in theinscription, Darius provides a lengthy sequence of events following the deathsof Cyrus the Great and Cambyses II in which he fought nineteen battles in aperiod of one year (ending in December 521 BC) to put down multiple rebellionsthroughout the Persian Empire. The inscription states in detail that therebellions, which had resulted from the deaths of Cyrus the Great and his sonCambyses II, were orchestrated by several impostors and their co-conspirators invarious cities throughout the empire, each of whom falsely proclaimed kinghoodduring the upheaval following Cyrus's death. Darius the Great proclaimed himselfvictorious in all battles during the period of upheaval, attributing his successto the \"grace of Ahura Mazda\". According to the tenets of the Zoroastrian religion, Ahura Mazdawas the creator god of light and wisdom, and his arch rival, the creator of alldestruction, was denoted as the god Angra Mainyu. It should not surprise thereader to know that Ahura Mazda was none other than Enki, and his half-brotherEnlil played the role of the great destroyer, the precursor of the Christiandevil, Angra Mainyu. If true, then the wiles of the Christian devil, promotedhimself as God and demonized the true creator, Ahura Mazda, as Satan or a sneakysnake as evidenced in the later Biblical Canon. Zoroastrianism, in various forms, served as the national or state religion for alarge portion of the Iranian people for centuries. The religion began to fadewhen the Achaemenid Empire was invaded by Alexander the Great, subsequentlydisintegrating and was further marginalized by Islam from the 7th centuryonwards with the decline of the Sassanid Empire. It was at this juncture inhistory that Allah’s Islam replaces Ahura Mazda’s Zoroastrianism as the newstate religion in Persia.Given that the Mesopotamian territory had been allotted to Enlil, it was just amatter of time until the Enlilites routed the remnants of their nemesis Enkiitesfrom the region. As evidenced by the situation in the Middle East, theEnlilites are growing in strength under the crescent moon-adorned flags incountries like Iran, Turkey, and Syria to name a few.Babylon had a brief late flowering of power and influence under the ChaldeanDynasty which took over much of the empire formerly held by their northernkinsmen. However, the last king of Babylon, the Assyrian born Nabonidus, paidlittle attention to politics, preferring to obsess with worship of the moon god,leaving day to day rule to his son Belshazzar.Could Allah, the god of the crescent moon, be none other than Nannar Sin,Enlil’s son, as we have postulated herein? Since the Mesopotamian territorybelonged to Enlil, his offspring, including the mood god Nannar, would have beenwelcomed there. Nannar was also a member of the Anunnaki council of 3760 BCE,and, as evidenced in the Atrahasis, he is shown to be the one that leads theIgigi miner’s rebellion in Africa under Enlil’s supervision. There are links in historical texts indicating that Nannar-Sin had a very largefollowing in his cult centers that were prolific in the area from southern Iraqto Syria, Turkey and Iran. Interestingly enough, the Kaaba stone in Mecca,Saudi Arabia, one of the sacred centers for the religion of Islam, wasoriginally dedicated to the moon god, referred to there as Allah. CouldNannar-Sin be the deity that Mohammed had an encounter with in the wilderness? Is Nannar-Sin the fabled Allah? Recall from the Atrahasis account:Atrahasis Tablet 1 [37, pg. 10]Then Alla made his voice heard,And spoke to the gods his brothersCome! Let us carry Ellil,The counselor of gods, the warrior, from his dwelling.Now, cry battle!The gods listened to his speech,Set fire to their tools,Put aside their spade for fire,Their loads for the fire-god,They flared up… The author asserts that it is no coincidence that Alla(h) is leading therebellion, right to his father Enlil’s domicile. Note the fiery rhetoric heused to stir up the crowd of Igigi miners. Seems to me that his behavior issimilar to that seen among the followers of Jihad in the Middle East, withspiritual leaders promoting warlike activities from the followers affiliatedwith the moon god, Allah. The genealogy tables and Sumerian records clearly indicate that Enlil had a sonon the Anunnaki council, Nannar Sin. Nannar (also called Sin) was the moon god;son of Enlil and Ninlil; father of Utu (sun god) and Inanna. It is not theintention of this book to definitively prove that the Alla referred to in theAtrahasis is the same Allah worshiped by Islam today, but would certainly be aterrific research project for those inclined toward finding the truth. Howwould the results of such research be received today? Knowing that Enlil wasthe god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the genocidal exterminator of earlyMesopotamian slaves and the Great Flood Proponent devised to wipe out all flesh,changed my perspective on the many labels of “God”. Hopefully, divulging thefact that Allah was an ancient astronaut from Nibiru and was the son of Enlil(AKA Zeus, Jupiter, Jehovah, El Shaddai…), will help illuminate the massesaffiliated with the religion of the crescent moon. Enlil’s offspring invariably invade and overtake the colonies of Enki ashappened in Atlantis and Mesopotamia. Thus Atlantis, a hidden away island, isstill susceptible to the nautical Enlil pirates that invaded from their islandbase of Crete. Note that the pirates of Crete were similar to the roamingmarauders that Enlil sponsored in Egypt, where their Biblical Exodus story isseverely mischaracterized. Keep in mind that Enlil was operating from theLevantine and Enki had his Egyptian domain adjacent to the headwaters of theNile river delta, in North Africa."},{"pageContent":"ENKI ESTABLISHES ATLANTISSpeaking of Atlantis, we find a connection from Sumeria to Greece via thislegendary lost city. We have written records about Atlantis recorded in theTimaeus by Plato. In the dialog between Critias and Socrates, a strange tale isconveyed which originated with Solon, wisest of the seven sages, althoughspecified as true, regarding the Great Athenians, whose memory had passed intooblivion. Critias picks the most monumental story recorded by Solon’s research,as a gratuity, stating that if Solon had finished the tale he would have been asfamous as Homer [114, pg. 26]. Critias continues, telling Socrates that at the head of the Egyptian delta,where the river Nile divides, there is a certain district which is called thedistrict of Sais, and the great city of the district is also called Sais, and isthe city from which sprang Amasis the king. And the citizens have a deity whois their foundress, called Neith, or Athena to the Greeks. Thus, the Egyptiansfelt a kindred connection to the Athenians. See God table 9. Solon visited the Egyptian priests to find out what they knew about Greekhistory, the times of old, admitting that “neither he nor any other Greek newanything worth mentioning about the past.” The reason the Greek history waslost was due to one of many destructions of mankind, arising out of variedcauses. Further adding insult to a short Greek memory, the Egyptian priest fromthe Sais chastens Solon: “As for those genealogies of yours which you have recounted to us Solon, theyare no better than the tales of children, for in the first place, you rememberone deluge only, where there were four with many lesser ones. In the nextplace, you do not know that there were dwelling in this land of yours one of thenoblest races ever to have lived of whom your land and your people are only aremnant.” (gap)“There was a time Solon, before the great deluge, when the city of Athens wasthe first in war and was preeminent for the excellence of her laws, and is saidto have performed the noblest deeds and have the fairest constitutions of anywhich history tells upon the earth” [114, pg. 26]. Plato inherited the writings of Socrates, discussing the history of Greece inhis unfinished notes. Solon, who was intending to use the tale of his poeminvolving the meaning of the historic Greek names provided by the Egyptianpriests, detailing his country’s noble ancestry. Plato picks up the lengthytale, beginning with the assumption that the gods had divided the whole earthamongst themselves, subsequently building temples in which they were enthronedas gods, accepting sacrifices and offerings from the genetic underlings. Poseidon, the god of the sea, receiving for his lot the island of Atlantis. According to the tale, Enki-Poseidon has children by a mortal woman, populatingthe island. In the account, a primitive man named Euenor lived in thesurrounding mountains. Cleito, his daughter, caught Enki’s fertility god eye. Poseidon fell in love with her, and had intercourse with her and, breaking theground, enclosed the hill in which she dwelt all round, making alternate zonesof sea and land, larger and smaller, encircling one another. Enki begat and brought up five pairs of male children, dividingthe island of Atlantis into ten portions; he gave to his first born of theeldest pair, his mother’s dwelling and the surround allotment, which was thelargest and best, and made him king over the rest; the others he made princes,and gave them rule over many men and a large territory. He named them all. Theeldest who was king, he named Atlas, and from him the whole island and the oceanreceived its name [114, pg. 39]. Extensive details about all aspects ofAtlantis are provided by Plato’s writing, recounting Solons historical forayinto the discovery of their noble links to the past. Thus, the mystery of Greekhistory was spelled out for Solon, and relayed to the world by Plato. Thisaccounting has been the factual basis for the search for Atlantis for manyyears, continuing to this day. Based on the writings, it seems obvious that theisland city of Atlantis was located along the rim of the now submerged AtlasMountain range in Northern Africa. Without the aid of a bronze age map depicting the port cities ofthe world, one could not rebuff the Darwinists who believed the sea levels circa2000 B.C. were little different than today. Yet the presence of hundreds ofsubmerged ancient construction sites from the Gulf of Chambay to Bimini, andfrom Cornwall to Nan Madol, certainly contradict that notion. Most of thesubmerged ruins worldwide are situated in the Mediterranean and easternAtlantic, right where you’d expect them to be, where king Atlas plied thewaters, building port facilities as told in Solon’s tale, now submerged sincethe end of the last Ice Age. Critias by Plato [114, pg. 32] For many generations, as long as the divine natured lasted inthem, they were obedient to the laws and well affectioned towards the gods whowere their kinsmen, for they possessed true and in every way great spirits,practicing gentleness and wisdom in the various changes of life, and in theirintercourse with one another. They despised everything but virtue, nor caringfor their present state of life, and thinking lightly on the possession of goldand other property which seemed only a burden to them. Neither were theyintoxicated by luxury, nor did wealth deprive them of their self-control, butthey were sober and saw clearly all these goods were increased by virtuousfriendship with one another, and that by excessive zeal for them, and honor ofthem, the good of them is lost, and friendship perishes with them.” We have traced a few of the complex civilizations that Enki wasinvolve in launching, from Eridu to Persia, Atlantis, Egypt and Greece. Next wewill explore the Anunnaki lessons taught to us about the Heavens. "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10: CELESTIAL TIME AND ZODIAC RULERS Living in the big city is hardly conducive to a successful hobbyin astronomy. Cities near the coast are often overcast given the formulation ofa marine layer. This moisture, coupled with prolific artificial lightingemanating from landscape and security lights, among a multitude of others,effectively blocks one’s ability to see the stars at night. Vacating the cityand driving inland to unpopulated areas, ideally at altitude and sporting lowhumidity on a cloudless partial moon-lit evening is where you will find thestargazers. Imaging living in a situation where one spent 3-4 hours a daydoing the domestic chore of securing resources needed to survive, then being innature enjoying life without corporate enslavement, as Zog the caveman lived. Okay, my virtual vacation aside, the stargazers of the past somehow, either oftheir own accord or with alien help, mapped the stars, grouped them into asuspiciously but profound twelve symbols still in use today. They also builtsophisticated temples using the megalithic stone blocks which tracked changes inthe processional slip the earth exhibits due to a wobble in its inclinedrotational axis. This detailed level of knowledge is impressive. Consider Zog, the hypothetical caveman with a nerdy disposition, who decides tomake a mark on a stone where a shadow is cast at first light each day, and beinga truly dedicated observer, continues his markings on the rock for at least onefull solar cycle (365 days). Zog would have data to show that on a certain daythe cycle repeated, perhaps he would have been keen enough to pick an unusualday, like the longest or shortest day as his focal point for the analysis. Thisimplies that Zog would also have to have kept track of the length of the day toassess which day is the longest or shortest. In either event, assuming a lothere, one could notice that the initial mark made on the stone at the shadow’sedge would not line up with the mark made on the same day one solar cycle ago. This is where one would need the knowledge of the division of a circle into somenumber of finite divisions. The concept of a circle, the Earth rotating on aninclined angle with an induced wobble, with precession relative to the solarecliptic experiencing slippage at a rate that enabled long-term calendar eventplanning, are difficult to fathom that Zog figured out on all this requisiteknowledge through his own through observations. Turns out that using threehundred and sixty degrees as the segmented measure allows one to represent therotational pattern of the earth around the sun, in a convenient mathematicalform that also allows application of the constant to Volume, Circumference, andArea measurements of a circle. Could the stargazing cave nerd have been smart enough to havespecified a unique day from which to compare the assumed repeating data cycles? If the 360 degree division standard was adopted and used, then we would findthat the difference in the first mark on the stone and the one that is a fullsolar cycle away, namely 364.25 days, round to 365, would be 1/72nd of a degreeoffset. Thus, Zog would have to extrapolate to figure out that it would take 72full solar cycles to offset the mark on the stone by 1 degree, having dividingthe circle arbitrarily into 360 degrees with a lucky guess. Thus, for theshadow mark etched on the “marker stone” to travel a full circle and arrive backat the same point as that annotated the first year, would take 72 years times360 degrees, or 25,920 years. That’s a lot of shells and beads to represent a“Great Year” as it is termed [20.] This is the level of knowledge that would be needed to begin to comprehend thescientific basis for the earth’s processional movement around the solarecliptic. Why would one dedicate such significant time observing the movementsof the sun on the horizon? Unless of course you were a nerd like Zog, or morelikely a temple priest watching the heavens for the appointed time of change tobe communicated to the next Zodiac ruler, in preparation for a change incommand. For the record, occurring on 07.29.13 as I work on this book, theGrand Sextile Alignment is occurring, creating a Star of David in the Heavens,for the 13th time since 1990 is truly significant as a War Star sign. There isa lot of buzz on YouTube about this event as the next one will not occur forover 100 years from now. Is it a coincidence, that simultaneously, Israel justbombed Damascus, again, as the world awaits a response? The situation in Syriaappears to be a Biblically significant war, especially if Damascus becomes aruinous heap as Isaiah 17:1 predicts it will as part of the end times. Farmers have used the knowledge of the longest day of winter as a marker pointin the planting cycle, seeking the earliest time in the season, depending ongeography, to sew their crops averting a crop damaging frost. The coming of theSpring Equinox was celebrated around the ancient world. Recognition of thisevent was fashioned in the temple architecture, providing a long axis aligned tothe point on the earth’s horizon where the sun rises, channeling the sunlightalong a corridor with a marker stone to save the place where the light strikes. To make the measurement relevant, the designer had to keep in mind that theearth is precessing, moving opposite the direction of rotation. Thus, the marks on the stone where the sun struck would be moving as indicatedpreviously for Zog. An ingenious way to deal with this is to assign the 360degree circle representing the orbital path with a set of divisions which can bevisually tracked in the night sky. This is where the twelve houses of theZodiac, provided to the Sumerians by the Anunnaki, are so useful. Simply usingthe star groupings relative to the horizon, split into three slices: SouthernHemisphere, Northern Hemisphere, and the Central Zone along the earth’sequator. Interestingly enough, the three segments were assigned to Enki, Enlil,and Anu respectively. At this point in our pretend scenario, assuming Zog would have been able tosimply watch the night sky and put together the Zodiac House we still use todayis questionable. That said, the Anunnaki not only divulged this knowledge tothe Sumerians, they even had their namesakes affiliated with the planets asshown in Table 6 below.

Pluto wasrecently demoted from planetary status and the thirteenth sign of Ophiuchus wasadded to the official Zodiac as of the year 2011. According to Robert Brit,Senior Science writer for Space.com, capping years of intense debate,astronomers resolved on August 24th, 2006, to demote Pluto from planetary statusto a dwarf planet category. Was this done as an appeasement to the Mayanpredictions? The reason is unclear. The hidden sign of Ophiuchus was designated between Sagittarius and Scorpio. Itwas stated in Mayan legends that the point in celestial time that the Sun wouldrise in the sign of Ophiuchus coincides with the solar system’s passage throughthe galactic center [66, 67]. By the 1930’s, the astronomical community had accepted the factthat the Galactic Center was located in the constellation of Sagittarius. Earlyobservations studying the source of static that was affecting transatlanticphone calls, led to the discovery of a 20.5 MHz frequency being emitted in theconstellation of Sagittarius, then known to be Galactic Center by scientists. The theory of the existence of a black hole at the center of our galaxy was putforth by Martin Rees and Donald Lynden-Bell in 1971. They believed that a blackhole could be one possible explanation for the tremendous amount of energy thathad been detected coming from the Galactic Center [109].Just three years later, Bruce Balick and Robert Brown detected such a compactsource in the inner one parsec core of the galactic nucleus [109]. They foundthe location of this extremely energetic source, Sagittarius A star, to coincidewith the dynamical center of the galaxy. The scientists had detected the firstevidence that a massive black hole resided in the heart of our galaxy. Theexact distance from the Sun to the Galactic Center falls within the range 25,000to 28,000 light years away. Due to the presence of interstellar dust, theGalactic Center cannot be studies in the visible, ultraviolet or X-raywavelengths. Current scientific data comes from observations using gamma rays,infrared, hard X-rays, and sub-millimeter radio wavelengths.The Milky Way passes through about 30 constellations. The band divides the nightsky into two roughly equal hemispheres. The Galactic plane is inclined by about60 degrees to the plane of the Earth's orbit. Why would one care about thecenter of the galaxy? Modern science, studying solar system physics, has shownthat the radiation within the galactic center is much higher than outside thatplane. Staying away from the galactic center has an additional advantage. Thecenter of the Galaxy is awash in harmful radiation. Solar systems near thecenter would experience increased exposure to gamma rays, X-rays, and cosmicrays, which would destroy any life trying to evolve on a planet. Radiation is measured in micro Sieverts, designated bySv. Theaverage radiation you receive per day is about 10Sv. Visiting the dentist foran X-ray radiates you with 100Sv, ten times the normal amount received in aday. The maximum allowable radiation dose for humans in the United States, foroccupational standards, is 50,000Sv. Severe radiation poisoning occurs at 2millionSv and 6-8 millionSv causes death. The Milky Way’s Galactic CosmicRadiation, or GCR, is found between a few tenths and few tens of GeV (yes, 10Giga Electron Volts), exceeding deadly human exposure limits. Referencing an article found online [118], in which the astronomer Parke Kunklewrote for NBC news, he states that due to the Earth's changing alignment in thelast 3000 years, the sign you were born into is now different than it was longago. Additionally, a 13th Zodiac sign called Ophiuchus, which falls betweenScorpio and Sagittarius, should amend the existing twelvesigns.  \"This is not something that happened today. This has gone on for thousands ofyears,\" says Kunkle. “Because of this change of tilt, the Earth is really overhere in effect and Sun is in a different constellation than it was 3,000 yearsago.\" The constellation of Ophiuchus is located near the celestial equator andis typically depicted as a man wrangling a serpent. \"Ophiuchus\" means\"serpent-bearer\" in Greek. One of several different characters from Greekmythology that Ophiuchus was thought to represent was Asclepius the healer. Thesnake is often associated with doctors, thanks to Thoth’s Caduceus, so Ophiuchusis often associated with healing images. The Romans also associated theconstellation with Asclepius, who learned the secret to immortality by watchingone serpent treat another serpent with healing herbs. Zeus summarily killedAsclepius with a lightning bolt because he didn't want everyone to be immortal,but later honored his good deeds by giving him a spot in the heavens. Soundslike something Enlil would do.[../images/00037.jpeg]Figure 16: Ophiuchus, the Missing Zodiac Sign This story sounds just like the god of wrath and vengeance given his badbehavior in Mesopotamia, given the consciousness-suppressing activities Enlilexhibits from the Atrahasis account forward in his relationship to mankind.The sign Ophiuchus can be found in the Sidereal Zodiac used by Hinduastrologers. The Sidereal Zodiac's astrological sign dates are based on a movingZodiac which has shifted almost one full sign from the fixed zodiac with 12signs still in use today. Thus, modern stargazers should technically be usingthese dates, shown below, which reflect the current alignment of the Sun, Earthand stars augmented with the missing sign of Ophiuchus.

There aredifferent models, some which divide the twelve signs evenly provisioning thirtydegrees per sign. Others allocate different degrees to each sign based itsactual transit time. Thus, using this method, not all Zodiac signs have thesame duration [45]. The Anunnaki relied on the accurate time-keeping priestsand temple calendars to observe the heavens and track the precessional sign theearth was in. Temples aligned either to equinox or solstice points on theEastern horizon, often had segmented viewing regions partitioned into eitherequivalent Zodiac house models, implying thirty degrees for each house, orunequal viewing segments based on their measured degrees in the specific Zodiacsign. Temples in use that exceeded the viewing azimuth for a given Zodiacalhouse, were sometimes re-oriented along a new viewing axis. This costlyoversight would have led to a more circular design structure like that used inStone Henge, allowing the architecture to adapt to the moving processionalazimuths. Archeoastronomy is a new science that takes into account the building alignmentas a function of which Zodiacal house the sun would be rising in during thattime period. Using this method has helped archeologists date stone structuresthat may be devoid of carbon-datable material [115]. Wikipedia has a nice writeup on the subject for those inclined to try it using software. Rulership was an important part of the transfer of kingship from Nibiru toEarth. The Sumerian King’s list provides a detailed, yet hard to believe recordthat dates back over 400,000 years ago. Given the ready affiliation of theAnunnaki namesakes with the known planets in our solar system, it should come asno surprise that the method chosen to justify a change in rulership wasestablished in the heavens. The jockeying for power and position on the Councilof Twelve rose to saber rattling intensity levels as the Zodiacal houseschanged. Consider our current Age change from Pisces to Aquarius, council changetime and the headlines indicate the DARK and the LIGHT gods are at war oncemore!!! My recommendation to the reader is to stay on the sidelines and not beused as a destructive pawn any longer. Counsel your sons and daughters to avoidmilitary service given the destructive and dishonorable missions they are beingassigned. Just say no! From the “Wars of Gods and Men”, Sitchin describes a scenario in which Mardukmakes a power grab approximately 24 years too early. The ability to accuratelymeasure which Zodiacal house the sun was rising in was critical to those inpower. Affiliating namesakes with planets was the ultimate power play. Thefollowing table shows the planets, their distance from the sun, and the solarorbital period in days. The information for Nibiru is not available (yet),although the orbital period was clearly specified as 3,600 Earth years. SeeTable 8.

Recall that the fractional number of 1.618 hasbeen declared the divine creation ratio, or  (Phi), it is derived fromexamining the Fibonacci Sequence which specifies the design ratio that alsoshows up in the heavens. The sequence is: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55…n=(n-1+n-2) The ratio is derived by dividing a number in the sequence by its n-1antecedent. Do this enough times and you will see the ratio converges to 1.618,rather quickly. 1/1=12/1=23/2=1.505/3=1.668/5=1.6013/8=1.62521/13=1.61534/21=1.61955/34=1.618 As you can see the series converges to 1.618 while oscillating around the likea damped sinusoid before converging to the creator’s assumed design ratio. Also, of great interest, is finding this same ratio between the Earth andVenus. Dividing the solar orbital period of Earth by that of Venus, and youfind the same ratio,. As above, so below it seems. Was this planetary ratiobetween Earth and Venus, also found in a plethora of terrestrial plants andanimals to include humans, an intentional artifact left over by the creator ofthe solar system, perhaps the Creator of All’s handiwork, as alluded to by theAnunnaki themselves? Thoth, as we know was none other than Enki’s son Ningishzida. He wrote theEmerald Tablets, in which he describes building the Giza pyramid structure. From the first tablet, he states: Emerald Tablets, Introduction [76]When Thoth, the Atlantean and Master raised the people of Khem (Egypt) to agreat civilization, and when the time came for him to leave Egypt, he erectedThe Great Pyramid over the entrance of the Great Halls of Amenti. In thePyramid, he posited his records and appointed Guards for his secrets from amongthe highest of his people.In later times, the descendants of these guards became the Pyramid Priests,while Thoth was deified as the God of Wisdom, the Recorder, by those in the ageof darkness which followed his passing. In legend, the Halls of Amenti becamethe underworld, the Halls of the Gods, where the soul passed after death forjudgment. According to modern researchers, the pyramids of Giza were constructed duringthe Age of Leo, which began in 10,500 BCE and lasted until 8,000 BCE. Thus theSphinx has the body of a lion, the Zodiac sign of Leo, and the face of Thoth itsbuilder, as stated in the Emerald Tablets. Sitchin also reports the same datafrom his records, giving credit to Thoth for the “building that is like amountain” construction. David Hatcher Childress, world explorer and author,regularly conducts Giza plateau Egypt tours as well as in South America, anotherAnunnaki mining outpost. See http://davidhatcherchildress.com[http://davidhatcherchildress.com] for more details. Without getting to far off the mark, while serving as a Chief Warrant Officerand Attack helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army 1982-1989, the concept ofgyroscopic precession lay at the technical basis for why a rotorcraft operatedthe way it did, as taught in Flight School, Fort Rucker, Alabama, graduatingLight Blue Flight class of 85-13. I digress. The angular momentum conservingprinciple states that applying a stimulus to a rotating body will manifest theinput force offset by ninety degrees in the direction of rotation. This isinteresting helicopter feature, to see the helicopter’s rotating swashplate tiltto the right given the counter clockwise blade rotation, as the cyclic controlinput is straight ahead, causing the aircraft to fly straight forward as aresult of this phenomenon. Now consider the Earth rotating like a gyroscope, the likes of which one findsin a toy store. If the top of the toy were split into two equal halves of acircle, letting one half be black and the other red, then an interesting visualeffect can be observed. While the top is spinning perfectly straight up anddown, the two halves of the circles will appear to stay stationary,differentiating the red and the black colored semi-circles clearly. Now, introduce a slight wobble to the stable spinning gyroscope by tapping itwith your finger. Observe the colored circles looking directly from above. Youwill see that the semi-circles appear to be rotating in the opposite directionof rotation. The slight wobble introduced causes the vertical axis to slip dueto the coefficient of friction increase which occurs where the surface area ofthe top impacts the horizontal support surface. As the top slows down, with theangular momentum forces decreasing, the wobble is exaggerated. At various rotational speeds, the wobbling toy will skip, coincident with wherethe point of impact was first imparted to the top. One can think of thisinduced wobble as an analogous event that must have occurred in the heavens suchthat the Earth has an inclined orbit of approximately 23.5 degrees relative tothe solar ecliptic. Is it possible that the source of the Earth’s wobble issome event that coincides with the Great Year? The implication would be thatsome force acting on the Earth was significant enough to cause the planet totilt away from the expected solar plane. A space intruder like a comet,asteroid, planet, or meteor could be the source of the Earth’s tilt andpotentially the wobble as well. Another speculative possibility for the readerto consider is that the forces within the Galactic Center could be responsibleto some degree for the Earth’s cyclical perturbations alluded to by the Mayans. Consider the 60 degree tilted plane our solar system has relative to theGalactic Center plane. If our entire solar system were to pass through theMilky Way Galaxy center in the sign of Ophiuchus as the Mayans stated, thenevery 13,000 years or so our entire solar system would cross through the highlyradiated Galactic Center being exposed to an intense gravity field. Try spinning a bicycle wheel in your hands, feeling the angularmomentum forces by changing the spin axis orientation. The spinning gyroscopewill oppose changes in the rotational plane. Now orient the spinning tire 60degrees relative to the ceiling, representing the Galactic Center as a forcefield. The force of gravity within the plane is much higher than outside,evidenced by the flat spinning, disk shaped geometry evidenced by images takenby the Hubble Telescope. If the spinning bike tire strike the ceiling at a 60degree angle, lifting it with your hands, what happens? Due to gyroscopicprecession previously discussed, the impact force of the ceiling, simulating thegradient field effect imposed by the massive black hole gravity flux, would showup ninety degrees in the direction of rotation causing the Earth to potentiallyflip and rotate about its axis, possibly explaining the plate tectonic suddenshift theory that Charles Hapgood wrote about in his book, supported by Einsteinin 1953. Einstein commented on Hapgood’s theory, stating that in a polar region there iscontinual deposition of ice, which is not symmetrically distributed about thepole. The earth’s rotation acts on these asymmetrically deposited masses, andproduces centrifugal momentum that is transmitted to the rigid crust of theearth. The constantly increasing centrifugal momentum produced in this way will,when it has reached a certain point, produces a movement of the earth’s crustover the rest of the earth’s body... [108]. The Anunnaki imparted to mankind significant knowledge about the workings in theheavens, planetary orbits and interactions having formed the basis of the EnumaElish, their creation account. Enoch was taken aloft by the Anunnaki and taughtthe entire workings of the heavens [36]. Advanced knowledge about the longwobble witnessed in the Earth’s processional movements, allowed the Niburianastronauts to create an ingenious system of Zodiac Houses assigned to a twelve,or thirteen part wheel, if including the recently added sign of Orphiuchus,thereby establishing a mechanism for term limits and power sharing by the elite. Temples were built aligned to the compass points in order to accurately assessthe repeating cycles of time. With the Zodiac Age changes came restructuringamong the Anunnaki rulers. All one needed to know was that every 72 years a 1degree slip occurs in the Zodiac wheel. If each of the original twelve housesof the Zodiac were equivalent, namely 30 degrees, then each sign would last 72years times 30 degrees equaling 2,160 years. So, approximately every twothousand years, major changes took place in leadership, often times impactingmankind with memorable events and wars [18]………………………………………………………….."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11: WARRING FACTIONS PAST AND PRESENT Given the rivalry that began to build among the Anunnaki deities over occupiedlands, specifically between archrivals Enlil and Enki; Anu scheduled a politicalvisit to arbitrate the conflict. The year was 3760 BCE according to theSumerian records, and the destination was the Sumerian city of Uruk, the city ofKing Gilgamesh. Cuneiform records detail the visit in intricate detail. Thepractical aspects of the trip involved specifically segregating the targetedregions for Anu’s direct reports and their offspring. The four regions the Anunnaki identified in the records were: the SinaiPeninsula, Mesopotamia, Egypt and South Africa, and the Indus Valley. Enki gotthe African continent. Marduk remained in his Gateway of the Gods City ofBabylon, clearly violating the terms of the territorial segregation having givenMesopotamia to Enlil, as Lord of the Command. Enki’s offspring were expected tomove to live within the protection provided in Africa, appears to be theimplication which Marduk rejected. This created conflicts, which escalated andeventually led to wars. The incursion on the rival brother’s territory, youwill recall from the Atrahasis account, is the reason given by Noah to leaveShuruppak, claiming that Enlil no longer found favor with him and that he wouldneed to move to Africa, Enki’s domain, to avoid conflict. Marduk maneuvers to avenge his father Enki which subsequently leads to war withNinurta over Zodiac timing. Conflicting accuracy of solar versus solar-lunarcalendars, as implemented by Thoth in the Yucatan, starting August 11, 3114 BCE,triggered the war. This is the Mayan long count start date. Using both thesolar and lunar cycle data provided Thoth with a more accurate calendar, onewhich could help avoid confusion over Zodiacal house boundaries, subsequentlyaverting skirmishes among the current and upcoming heirs to the Niburianallotted throne. Chichén Itzá, the temple of the moon and the sun, is anexample of the advanced timekeeping structures built in the Yucatan Peninsula,as eloquently detailed by Sitchin in his book “The Lost Realms” [19]  Biblical Canon and liturgical dogma often representthe covenant that Enlil makes with Abram, renaming him Abraham thereafter, togive his seed the land of Israel. Recall from Genesis: The Lord’s Covenant With Abram [Genesis 15:1-17 ]1 After this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision:“Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.”2 But Abram said, “Sovereign Lord, what can you give me since I remain childlessand the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?” 3 And Abramsaid, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be myheir.”4 Then the word of the Lord came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but ason who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.” 5 He took him outsideand said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.”Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”6 Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness.7 He also said to him, “I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of theChaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.”(gap)12 As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick anddreadful darkness came over him. 13 Then the Lord said to him, “Know for certainthat for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country nottheir own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. 14 But I willpunish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out withgreat possessions. 15 You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and beburied at a good old age. 16 In the fourth generation your descendants will comeback here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”17 When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with ablazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces. 18 On that day the Lordmade a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, fromthe Wadi of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates— 19 the land of the Kenites,Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 20 Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, 21 Amorites,Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.” As noted, the land that Abraham was to be given was already occupied by severaldifferent tribes to include the Hittites and the Canaanites. If a land is givento you but someone is already occupying the region, the gotcha is that Abrahamand his successors would be ordered to conduct a genocidal incursion into theregion, murdering all that lived in each village, until the entire area had beencleared. What kind of person would sign up to a real-estate deal like that? Enlil made a covenant with Abram to route the existing occupants of theLevantine via his offspring, not him personally. This was tantamount togenocide, Enki’s offspring were the targets. It is told in the Canonical biblefrom the Jacob standpoint. What about the Ishmael standpoint in the Qur’an[115]? After all, if a child is going to be sacrificed to God as an offering,abominable to consider in and of itself, why not sacrifice the one that was notin line to be heir, namely Ishmael? The Koran specifies that this was the childtaken to Mount Horeb, not Jacob as told the Bible. How does one ascribe the term “righteous”, as Abram did in verse Genesis 15:6,to the LORD that made the deal with him, at the same time declaring that Abramhimself will never make it to the land described in the covenant, but rather hewould meet his ancestors first as stated in verse 15. You, however, will go toyour ancestors instead of benefitting from our deal. Oh, your offspring willbenefit though, after numerous wars based on Enlil’s desire to exterminate anylife in the Levantine. This is one of many examples in which the brothers, or theiroffspring went to war. Mankind was merely a pawn in the territorial disputesthat arose in the region. The skirmishes were not limited to direct conflictsbetween Enki and Enlil, but rather sprang up among their progeny as well. Enkiand Marduk, the great Egyptian gods Ptah and Ra respectively, activelyparticipated in the genetic wars against the Enlilites. Enki produced prolific and strategic offspring at critical junctures inmankind’s history. In the Enki and Ninharsag Paradise Myth, a strategicconjugal visit occurs in an attempt to spawn a rightful heir. After all,Ninharsag was Enki’s half-sister. In the tale, aspirations to control part ofthe Sinai Peninsula that contained the relocated space port from Sippar, theEgyptian pyramids used for navigational and other means, were discussed betweenthe two. Several children were born to Enki, but the offspring from Ninharsagended up being a girl, disqualified from rulership. He kept trying, producingeight progeny, six females and two males resulted. Each offspring was assignedpolitically strategic roles designed to subvert, although subtly at times,Enlil’s authority and command. Whoever controlled the space related facilitiescould access the space vehicles and communications equipment that was theAnunnaki’s only link to their home planet, where critical resources tradedhands. Recall the tale of Isis, Osiris, and Horus from the land of Egypt. In theaccount, Seth left Upper Egypt (south) to the coveted lower region (north)allotted to Horus. Seth eliminated Osiris using a deceitful coffin trick, andappeared to have gotten away with the murder until Horus is geneticallyreconstituted from the dead god’s phallus (semen or DNA?) by Ninharsag-Isis. His rejoicing coup came to an end in the year 363 BCE when Horus takes revengeon Seth, starting what is termed the first Pyramid War. According to Sitchin,this is the first war that the gods used men as their expendable pawns. [18 pg.155]. Astoundingly, after studying the Egyptian Tarot Magus card, we find thatThoth is given yet another AKA name, Osiris. See Genesis of the Cosmos by Dr.Paul LaViolette page 152 for the details."},{"pageContent":"HORUS AND SETH WAGE WARHorus recruits other gods from Africa to counter attack the incursions of Seth. Aided by the Winged Disk that Thoth made, Horus made his way north toward theGiza plateau. According to the records, a significant skirmish took place neara chain of lakes separating the Sinai Peninsula and Egypt. Much carnage ensued,Seth’s forces suffering significant casualties. The war escalated to the pointthat Seth and Horus engaged in direct combat with each other. Their tacticalescapades involve using tunnels for cover and concealment and aerial combat overthe Sinai Peninsula. Horus prevailed and the Anunnaki Council delegates theEgypt region to Horus as the victor. Seth was banished from the region,purportedly taking up domicile as an exile in eastern Asian island according toSitchin. Additional conflicts persisted between the Enlilites and Enkiites, strategicallyfocused on controlling space related facilities like Giza, the space port in theSinai, and mission control functions in Jerusalem. Enlil won the Lord of the Command title to replace Enki in Mesopotamia aspredicated by Anu during his paternal referee visit circa 3760 BCE. Thus, theJewish people, descendants of Jacob, were in a geographic position to bepromoted as the guardians of the “portal” that was built beneath the TempleMount in Jerusalem. This Anunnaki only portal was used for high-level VIPtravelers that visited Earth from Nibiru like Anu. This was the post-dilluvialbond Heaven-Earth. Anu visited Earth using this portal, and various missions toNibiru were launched from Jerusalem’s mission control center [53]."},{"pageContent":"MOHAMMED VISITS HEAVEN FROM JERUSALEMAccording to the Qur’an, Mohammed was shuttled from Mecca to Jerusalem where heascended to heaven [115]. It is the author’s humble opinion that the portal ofMount Horeb, similar to the one found in Uruk, is the reason behind the world’sobsession with Jerusalem. According to the Lost Book of Enoch, the watchersare to be punished at the end of days [36, pg. 122]. These convicts on “deathrow” until that appointed time would definitely want a way out if one existed. The only way off the planet was via rocket ship, Shem as they were deemed, orvia the portal reserved for VIPs. Since the convicted rebels would most likelybe restricted from accessing vehicles that provided them a ready Earth-prisonbreak, the portal may have been the only Anunnaki bond heaven-earth spacefacility remnant left on Earth. Thus, protecting access to the portal, assumingit is still functional, would be of tantamount importance on Earth, as evidencedby the alliances and maneuverings between the United States and Israel relativeto their perceived enemies.

Forthose paying attention to the symbols used by the modern day kings and theiraffiliated kingdoms, the all Seeing Eye atop the partially completed pyramid, asdesigned into the world’s standard currency, the U.S. Dollar, begs the mostcasual observer to query the origins of such ancient trademarks. Could it bethat the power behind the secret societies, such as the Masons and theirinfiltrators, the Illuminati, as documented by Laurence Gardener in his premierbook “Genesis of the Grail Kings”, are broadcasting their intent to establish aNovus Ordo Seclorum, a New World Order? The first phrase, Annuit Coeptis, isless well known in translation from Latin. According to Wikipedia, the phraseis taken from the Latin words annuo; annuit in its third person present perfectform, means to nod or approve. The term coeptum is translated as commencementor undertaking. Together the accepted translation is “He approved of theundertakings”. There are implications that God (He) is the approving authorityof the New World Order undertakings, although any label of “God” was left offthe back of the dollar by the U.S Mint.

The Eye of Providence (or the all-seeing eye of God) is a symbol showing an eyeoften surrounded by rays of light or a glory and usually enclosed by a triangle.It is sometimes interpreted as representing the eye of God watching overhumankind. Imagery of an all-seeing eye can be traced back to Egyptian mythologyand the Eye of Horus, and is affiliated with Freemasonry today, as evidenced inthe architecture of the “Great Temple” of the 33rd degree Scottish Rite Templelocated in Washington D.C.

Whilevisiting Washington D.C., and the Library of Congress in the year 2009, doingresearch for this book, a private tour visit was arranged to see the insides ofthe Scottish Rite Temple, headquartered there. It was here that the theories Ihad been researching involving the Sumerians transformed from a curious delvinginto the past as a hobby, to a serious matter to contemplate. It was clearlyevident that the Masons had played a pivotal role in the founding of theWashington, D.C., the new Atlantis where the trestle board plans for a NovusOrdo Seclorum were memorialized on the nation’s currency, lest one be in doubtas to the identity of the hidden, yet all powerful architects and purveyors ofthe New World Order [65]."},{"pageContent":"ENOCH VISITS HEAVEN-NIBIRUEnoch describes his journey to Nibiru, although his departure location isunclear. Enoch is a central character to the Masonic rituals. He lived 365years (symbolic of the days in a year?) and then was no more as he took upresidence with “God”. Genesis 5:21 (NIV)When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. And after hebecame the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and had othersons and daughters. Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because Godtook him away. The lost book of Enoch states that he was involved in playing an intercessionaryrole between higher level Anunnaki Council members and Azazel, the Igigicommander that led the 200 rebels to take human women for themselves. The endof days mentioned in the Book of Enoch implies that the Igigi remnants thatbroke galactic law knew that there was no escaping the punishment that was due. In the end times, they would be looking for a portal, like the one that onceexisted in Uruk, and likely exists beneath the temple mount in Jerusalem, toexit planet Earth and attempt to flee in exile. As the judgment date drawsnearer, those alien astronauts condemned for their rebellious act to sew theirgenetic seed among man, will attempt all means to control access to Jerusalem’sportal, using humans as expendable fodder in their quest to escape punishment. "},{"pageContent":"BABYLON DESTROYED BY ENLILITESThe destruction of the Tower of Babylon was committed by Enlil and his sonNinurta, most likely, given the circumstances and the bloodline feud. Destroying the tower, most certainly a space vehicle launch facility, waswrought to avert Marduk, chief deity of Babylon and son of Enki, from bypassingthe Sinai space port. The Sinai territory was under Ninharsag’s authority,although Enlil treated it as his own. Therefore, Enlil decided to destroyMarduk’s obvious attempt to grab power and authority in the region from theEnlilites by having his own bond heaven-Earth facilities, to come and go as hepleased without Enlil’s control. Marduk was termed “he of the pure mound” by his father Enki and had the addedtitle of “Marduk the Avenger”, implying a sworn oath to avenge his father foraverted birth right issues whose origins apparently had their source back homeon Nibiru [18]. This inheritance misunderstanding between the half-brothers wasepic and played out over long periods of time on Earth, given the Anunnaki godsability to master time, living for incredible durations although not imperviousto death.

This alien bad behavior should be familiarto mankind, after all we have their genetic mark, and apparently their warringdisposition as well, given fallen state of the world today. The world’s nationsare in warring chaos and the average person is contemplating whether these arethe end of days? Israel is surrounded by hostile threats and apocalypticmaneuvers are under way.Marduk, having carved out the city of Babylon as his temple headquarters, wasofficially living in the territory that was initially his fathers, but had beentransferred to Enlil as lord of the Command, focusing his efforts in and aroundUr, Sippar, and Nippur. Marduk wanted control of the space port located at Sippar and ultimately went towar with the Enlilites fighting over the tactically significant terrain. Eventually, Ninurta obtained a forbidden nuclear weapon hidden away in a caveand used it to destroy the space port when it became evident it could no longerbe defended from the onslaught of the Marduk’s attacks. Interestingly, unbeknown to most, Abraham was an astute military general,working for Enlil. He was dispatched to Egypt to most likely spy on Enki’sforces which landed in the Egyptian Nile Delta where he and his offspring wereresponsible for building the great pyramids which were used as navigational aidsand energy generation and communication facilities. Abraham also came face toface with Marduk’s forces in the vicinity of Haran, a city named after Abram’sbrother, also hailing from the Sumerian city of Ur.\\ In the final chapter, Zeus and Apollo assert themselves as the Father Son duo,the Great Destroyers. Who will they use as human fodder this time? With Zodiachouses changing to Aquarius, the Water Bearer’s sign. Recall Enki/Poseidon wasassigned control over the water. Lord of the Waters was his title given byAnu. The rising tides that suddenly buried Atlantis during the last earthchanges, may be receding soon. According to top researchers, the New Atlantisis the planned headquarters for the New World Oder (NWO) [113]."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12: ZEUS, APOLLO, AND THE NEW ATLANTIS Prior to establishing the city of Atlantis, Enki and his Anunnaki gods on thecouncil that declared mankind’s fate, utilized the city of Baalbek, Lebanon as aspace facility. It is here that the famed king Gilgamesh seeks an encounterwith the gods in his initial quest for immortality, encountering the bull ofheaven, which he and Enkidu, the genetic chimera, slew. Symbolically this iswhere the Anunnaki Council of 12 became the Greek Pantheon. The Anunnaki, as a result of an all-out nuclear onslaught on the Sinai Peninsulacirca 1600 BCE, left the region of Sumer, avoiding the “evil wind”, orradioactive fallout as reported in the records. The Anunnaki Council of Twelve,effectively became the Greek Pantheon at Baalbek, moving Eastward towards theGreek peninsula to avoid the fallout of Ninurta’s aerial destruction wrought onthe Sinai space port [18]. Poseidon, as noted in the previous chapters, established the island nation ofAtlantis, siring offspring that eventually landed in Greece. Poseidon and Zeusboth had temples in Athens, Greece. It is well known that the Greek Pantheonwas accepted as the state religion in Rome until Constantine opted to subsumethe growing followers of Christ into a pagan aggregate, combining the birth ofJesus with the holiday of Saturnia on December 23rd, currently recognized asDecember 25th, Christmas. According to Wikipedia, Saturnalia was an ancient Roman festival in honor of thedeity Saturn, the Greek equivalent of Cronus, held on December 17 of the Juliancalendar and later expanded with festivities through December 23. The holidaywas celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn in the Roman Forum and apublic banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and acarnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms: gambling was permitted,and masters provided table service for their slaves.

Operating under the assumption that the deities of Sumeria werethe same as those that occupied the mythological Greek Pantheon, we can createTable 9 that depicts the God’s namesakes which spanned multiple cultures,maintaining their symbols and attributes in spite of the intentional changes totheir hidden namesakes. Rob Solarian [38] provides several god tables thatspan other cultures as well.

This cross cultural link establishes the Anunnaki as the true powerbrokers behind the rise of the world’s great civilizations, Mesopotamia, Egypt,and Greece to name just a few. They were also the authority vested in therulers that wielded that power on behalf of the empire or kingdom. According to the gospel author Paul, in his letter to the Greek Church atPergamum, it was the location of the seat of Satan in the Bible: Revelation 2:12 (NIV)“To the angel of the church in Pergamum write:These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword. 13 I knowwhere you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. Youdid not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithfulwitness, who was put to death in your city—where Satan lives. Thus, it seems we have tracked Angra Maiyu from his antagonistic role to AhuraMazda from Persia to Greece, where the Biblical writers have established inwriting that Satan has his throne in Pergamum. The Pergamum Altar is a massivestructure originally built in the 2nd century BC in the Ancient Greek city ofPergamum. The temple was dedicated to the Greek god Zeus. The Pergamum Altar was shipped out of the Ottoman Empire from the originalexcavation site by a German archeological team led by Carl Humann, andreconstructed in the Pergamum Museum in Berlin in the 19th century. Zeus’sAltar can be seen in the museum alongside other monumental structures such asthe Ishtar Gate from Babylon. [../images/00040.jpeg]Figure 19: Throne of Satan, Altar of Zeus A mockup of the altar was designed for Obama’s stage at the DemocraticNominating convention held at the mile high stadium in Denver, Colorado, 2008. Was Obama indicating through his choice of location and affiliation with Zeus,that he had been put in a role as United States President, which exposed him tothe most highly classified information: namely confronting the reality of theAnunnaki presence on Earth, and the political ramifications thereof? Obama, asPresident would be serving Enlil as a puppet leader of the most powerful nationon the planet? Revelations 9:11 (NIV)They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew isAbaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer). According to Tom Horn, author of “Apollyon Rising 2012” [113], Zeus and his SonApollo would assert themselves as leaders of the New World Order using theCatholic Church and the United States Presidency as the intended seats to beoccupied by the father-son duo. Also, according to the Bible in Revelations9:11, Apollo may have shared in the judgment to come, spoken of in the Lost Bookof Enoch, as leader of the Igigi to be cast into the Abyss. This Revelation prophecy formed the basis for the assertion that Apollo would beon the rise during the time that the New World Order was being established, asTom Horn described, wreaking havoc and destruction with a spirit antithetical tothat of Christ, along with his father, Zeus (Satan) who would perpetuate himselfin the Christian Apocalyptic role as the False Prophet. According to Tom, Zeuswould be promoted through the Catholic Church as the Pope, and Apollo wouldmaneuver his way into controlling the reigns of the most powerful military onthe planet, the United States of America. It remains to be seen whether TomHorn was correct in his identification of the Anunnaki elites poised to bringabout a New World Order. Given the symbols affiliated with the hidden powerbrokers of the world, coupled with the almost scripted fulfillment of Bibleprophecy associated with Israel, it seems that the Anunnaki are returning aspromised, with unknown consequences for mankind. If Zeus has his way expect amassive reduction in the human population. Consider the forces of creation anddestruction represented by Enki and Enlil. From Anu’s perspective, both areneeded. This is hard to grasp, but creation and destruction have to be inbalance to maintain homeostasis. Thu, seeing the fact that the half-brotherscooperate is analogous to God and the Devil playing a board game for theconquest of mankind’s soul. The epic battle between dark and light, good andevil.Could Apollo be the “Angel in the Whirlwind” referred to by former presidentGeorge W. Bush, in a speech he gave as a prelude to the unleashing ofdestructive forces in the Iraq Gulf war and subsequent Middle East turmoil,riots, and upheavals as seen in the “Arab Spring”? In the interim period, between governmental disclosure of the Anunnaki alienpresence on earth, and the build up to World War III, mankind is trapped betweenthe fates declared by their Niburian gods and the perceived freedom to pursuelife, liberty, and happiness as the New Atlantis arises before our very eyes. Canada’s former Defense minister, Paul Hellyer, is going viral on YouTube,testifying to the United States Congress about alien astronauts which he haddirect knowledge of in his official capacity.In his YouTube video released on July 24th, 2013[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu5V8gqFQ1c[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lu5V8gqFQ1c]], Paul mentions up to 20 alienspecies that have been here, some for thousands of years, hailing from ZetaReticuli, Pleiades, Orion, Andromeda Galaxy and the Altair Star Systems, whilereading from his book “Light at the End of the Tunnel: A Survival Plan for theHuman Species”. Although, Paul does not mention Nibiru or the Anunnaki, to myknowledge.Paul makes particular mention about aliens occupying a base near Indian Springs,Nevada, guarded by United States Air Force personnel where he discusses twoalien “Tall Whites” working with the United States Government. These entitiesare most likely Zeus and Apollo, as predicted by Tom Horn and the BiblicalRevelations reference to Apollyon being the demon leader. Paul Hellyer spent 23years in the Canadian government finalizing his career as the minister ofdefense. His assertion is that the universe is teeming with a variety ofintelligent life forms, some far more advanced than we are, and they areinteracting with us shaping world events as claimed in this book, from thebeginning of recorded time.In the Christian tradition, the faithful hold out the hope for the return of themessiah Jesus, to bring the heavenly (Niburian) kingdom to Earth (like Eridu?) When the three wise men of the East, namely dispatched astrologers from AhuraMazda’s Persia, were sent with kingly gifts for Jesus-Ningishzida at birth, itshould force one to ask the question why Magi from Iran, Enki’s domain, weretraveling to an area controlled by Enlil’s Roman governors and Jewish priestsloyal to the god of wrath and vengeance, Jehovah himself? It should be obviousto the reader that is was Enki interceding on behalf of mankind, just as he didearlier in the Atrahasis account in Mesopotamia and Africa, countering theoppressive beat-down his brother had planned for the noisy humans. Suppression of Human Consciousness, a tenet that Enlil strongly supportedrelative to the primitive workers fashioned by Enki and his half-sisterNinharsag in Africa, was a concept closely tied to slavery, purportedly outlawedon Nibiru. Recall that consciousness had the stinging side effect of empoweringthe enslaved to rise up casting off their oppressors, not an acceptable slavebehavior under Enlil’s command. Enki was far more sympathetic to the humancause, rightly so as their genetic creator. Thus, it should not surprise thereader to find that Jesus’ bloodline was connected to Enki, not Enlil. Thereare many instances in the Sumerian record in which Enki subverts the authorityand command of Enlil, much to his angry chagrin. This is why the Jews rejectJesus as the messiah: their god Enlil could never accept a geneticrepresentative of Enki as mankind’s vehicle out of a terminally suppressedconsciousness. Jesus threw mankind a rope on behalf of the Enkiites, providinga means to continue their spiritual evolution as Enki believe the Creator of Allintended. Consider the dying and rising god rituals that were frequentlyconducted in Egypt, Enki’s domain. A significant country and god list showingthat the ritual was conducted across a broad region was noted. The point of theritual, according to Wikipedia, was to dispense a frequency from the departinggod which was used to elevate human consciousness to that of the departing/dyinggod. Compare the language used in the Bible with the concept just described. John 1:12 (NIV)Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave theright to become children of God. Note the general idea of receiving a “frequency” or “power” that is latent,imposing the responsibility of “becoming” or transforming into Enki’s geneticarchetype. This subtle reference holds the key to the internal kingdom ofNibiru/Heaven. It is the author’s direct experience that the latent energyreferenced by Jesus-Thoth is fully described in detail in the Emerald Tablets. Additionally, the concept of transformation or becoming implies action that mustbe taken by the frequency recipient. It is the author’s personal contention,that becoming involves releasing the latent Kundalini energy allocated by thedying god frequency stored in the Ganglion of Impar (in the Sacrum) and aligningthe human body with the gravity field so that equation [EQ5A] is realized. Atthis point, the Caduceus of Thoth-Jesus will make more empirical sense to thereader. Thus, Jesus-Thoth taught that if one were to receive the “frequency” beingdispensed by his death, that it had the power to transform the primitiveworkers, whose consciousness had been repeatedly repressed by the Enlilites,occupying the Levantine with Pontius Pilate as the acting Governor. He was thejudge at Jesus’ trial, and authorized his crucifixion. So what did it mean tobecome a child of God? Could it be related to an internal change in humanenergy and consciousness, achieving the knowledge of good and evil as Enlilsought to withhold from the first primitive workers that Enki had brought to theEridu garden of ED.IN (the Biblical Eden), where they were being observed toensure that the procreative genetic upgrade provided by Enki’s sonNingishzida-Thoth, were effective? Did Jesus-Thoth allude to the seven chakrasbeing blocked, when he spoke of casting out the seven demons from Mary Magdalenein Mark 16:1? It would make sense, if, where the finite meets the infinite,where energy meets matter, we find the kingdom of God within you as Jesus statedin the Gospels as measurable energy along the Chakras. According to a website article sponsored by the United Church of God, “Is theKingdom of God within you?”, many people believe Jesus Christ taught that theKingdom of God is something that exists only in the hearts and minds ofbelievers. They base this on the Bible verse: Luke 17:20-21: (NIV)\"Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Heanswered them and said, 'The kingdom of God does not come with observation; norwill they say, 'See here!' or 'See there!' For indeed, the kingdom of God iswithin you.'\" The article takes issue with this statement, explaining that the assumption thatthe Kingdom only exists in the hearts of believers was incorrect, as the correctGreek translation for the word entos, within is better translated “in the midstof”. This is a pivotal distinction, rather than Christianity being a conceptin their hearts, Jesus was warning them that they were so spiritually blind thatthey could not recognize God in him, the future king of an Earthly rulership,according to the article [119]. The author emphatically disagrees with the United Church stance. Given ourknowledge of the electromagnetic spectrum and the human body whose structure andfunction provide mechanisms for mankind’s Anunnaki enslavement and ascension, Thoth-Jesus’ frequency dispensation allow the chosen to pass through the narrowgates of the righteous rules of the rocket ship from Nibiru, bypassing Enlil’sglass ceiling. Thoth-Ningishzida’s emblem was the famed healer’s Caduceus. This symbol of the serpent and the Tree of Knowledge are represented in theinsignia of the American and British medical associations. The brain’s pinealgland was directly associated with the Tree of Life by the ancient Greeks. Twocoiled serpents (DNA double helix) wrapped around a central winged pole, with aknob on top (pineal gland) had significant meaning relative to energy andmatter, associated with the messenger-god, Mercury-Hermes-Ningishzida, thriceborn. The central staff represents the spinal cord and the nerve gangliadistributed at the seven discrete Chakras. The wings represent the brain’slateral ventricles, with the pineal represented as a unary ball on top of thecentral pole. The combination of the central pineal gland, coupled with thelateral wings, is sometimes referred to in the Yoga tradition as the Swan offull enlightenment. Mystery schools located along the Nile River were administered by Thoth-Hermes,whose primary goal was teaching students the process for achieving enlightenedconsciousness. The process of activating the potential Kundalini energy in thesacrum, and its wiggling snake-like movement from the bottom of the central poleat the end of the coccyx bone (defined as the Ganglion of Impar, which ispurported to be the negative pole of the energy body) upwards to the crownChakra collocated with the pineal gland, triggering a DMT release and anelevated consciousness as indicated by wings of flight. Jesus spoke of casting out seven demons and called peoplestiff-necked in the New Testament. Given our discussion of the fallen state ofmankind, specifically referring to Structural Integration and the extent towhich human fascia naturally stiffens as we age, could the term mean a physicalproblem, or stubbornness, or are the two related? Is this derogatory label usedfor the primitive workers, calling them “stiff-necked”, used by the Anunnakielite, namely Enlil, given his influence in rewriting the Sumerian tales bycaptive Hebrew Priests dedicated to appeasing his wrath in the Torah? The Godof the Old Testament Bible (Enlil) uses the term 10 times as documented here. * Exodus 32:9, 33:3, 33:5, 34:9 * Deuteronomy 9:6, 9:13, 10:16 and Deuteronomy 31:27 * 2 Kings 17:14 and 2 Chronicles 30:8According to Structural Integration principles, human fascia loses moisture, orground substance as it is termed, with age, the collagen hardening like bone insome folks. This is a keen observation Enlil makes, noting a potential defectin his arch rival Enki’s primitive worker physical design. Apparently, aswitnessed in the global population of humans and their relationship to gravity,we see that the connective tissue hardens over time without intervention,leading to various medical labels to include Fibromyalgia. Western Medicine,along with academia, the government and the military have been infiltrated andtaken over by NWO forces. Thus, don’t expect to get well in the current healthcare system, and those services that will truly get you healthy are not coveredby insurance. Previous Fibromyalgia SI clients were counseled to avoid the workby their Western medicine primary care providers, opting instead to play therole of pharmacologist versus actual healer. True healers like Dr. RobertFulford, D.O. are few and far between. His 60-year practice as an old timeosteopathic doctor is evolved and inspiring. See his book “Robert Fulford, D.O.And the Philosopher Physician”, Eastland Press, 2002.To finalize the discussion on whether the Kingdom of Nibiru, I mean Heaven, iswithin the energy body of human, a further look at the Chakra system and theantagonistic position many Christian organizations have taken relative to theorganized stretching system is now discussed, again, for the last time I hope.Suppose for a moment that the blockages in the human body that impede theChakras from working have to do with an unstructured body (subluxation is a termoften used by Chiropractors) in the gravity field, as Ida Rolf indicated in herseminal book [6]. Given the fact that Jesus spent 30 or so years unaccountedfor studying in Egypt, likely as a student at the Thoth’s mystery schoolaccording to historical records, Enki’s domain, where the scientists wereesteemed. Let’s call the blockages demons and then follow along. Mary Magdalene was Thoth-Jesus’ best student and most highly esteemed disciple. If Jesus had cleared her seven Chakras, or seven demons as Mark and Luke recordin the New Testament accounts, then it is possible that she had already beentransformed into a higher level Anunnaki consciousness, more on par withJesus-Ningishzida. It is no wonder he preferred her company over that of theother disciples whose consciousness was still most likely at Root Chakra level. Some pretty radical thinking about Chakras and the casting out of demons isevidence of this un-evolved belief by some Christians. [../images/00041.jpeg]Figure 20: Hindu Chakras, Colors, Gods According to some sources, the “demons” that are blocking the Chakras areaffiliated with the Hindu religion. Based on the response of the Demoniac in thetomb setting that Jesus encounters in the Gospels, he says that the name of thedemon is Legion, and we are many. Could these “demons” be the Igigi that weregiven a judgment of destruction at the end times, according the Book of Enoch. The demon asks if Jesus has come to judge him before the appointed time, whichis when exactly? Interesting coincidence here. There is a distinct battleground that has formed between some religions and the human nerve ganglia, theChakras as shown. For clarification, listed below are the Chakras, theircolors, and the Hindu affiliated Gods that have a cork stopper stuck in yourganglia from birth, according to some… What follows is a link to the sourcematerial. http://www.lotussculpture.com/blog/chakras-colors-hindu-gods/[http://www.lotussculpture.com/blog/chakras-colors-hindu-gods/] by Kyle Tortora,Nov 2, 2012."},{"pageContent":"CHAKRAS, COLORS, BIOLOGY, AND HINDU DEITIES:1.

The mind, as the sense organ and actionorgan are associated with this chakra. Feelings associated with this chakra arespirituality, awareness, and sense of time. Hindu God -Ardhanarishvara –anandrogynous form of Hindu god Lord Shiva and Parvati, also known as Devi andShakti.7. Sahasrara: The Crown Chakra – located at the top of the head, the pinealgland. Associated with purple, or gold. It is from this Chakra that all othersemanate. It relates to pure consciousness. In Hindu literature, it is known as“the supreme center of contact with God.” Here liberated ones abide in communionwith the Self. Chakra is controlled by Hindu God Lord Shiva.It is the author’s personal experience that ethical-righteous behavior is afruit of the spirit achieved by those brave enough and disciplined enough torelate their bodies to the gravity field. The mystical “Rolf Line”,representing a human aligned to the gravity field fulfilling equation [EQ5/EQ5A]shown in Chapter 6, represents the maximal human energy. This energy or spiritas it is called in religious organizations, coincides with the highestintelligence imparted by the creators: both the Creator of All as termed by theAnunnaki, and the premier genetic scientist, the far-sighted Enki, putting hispersonal stamp on the primitive worker Adapa, the first modern man. A veryunique stamp was placed on the primitive workers: seven nerve ganglia alignedin ascending order, partitioning of the visible spectrum into seven discretelyquantized wavelength specific (rainbow-colored) Chakras imparted to his uniquecreation: the primitive workers of the seventh planet, now called Earth. Sevenwas a lucky number for good reason, as promoted by the Anunnaki. Seven timesseven has even more significance it seems, at least for me. That is thebiological age at which I finally got this book to print, nine years in themaking. Thoth states in the Emerald Tablets that he lived three incarnations. Could oneof the incarnations have been played out as the bringer of salvation to theprimitive workers, living as Enlil’s pawns protecting a transportation portalwhich they know nothing about, in the land promised to Abraham. Subversivetactical births seeding a genetic war against his half-brother Enlil were beingplayed out in Jerusalem, right beneath his nose. What better way for Enki tomake up for a genetic enslavement decision imposed on mankind, approved by theAnunnaki Council in Africa, than to freely make an energetic frequency-basedmechanism available to his creation, that by simply believing in a name, hadthe power to transform the intentionally dumbed-down genetic underlings designedto mine gold, into the “Sons of God”, allowing the evolution of consciousness toproceed unabated according the genetic seed in mankind, designed by the Creatorof All. Given that Enki’s genetic material was used to create the first Adapa, thetransformation promised by Jesus-Thoth-Ningishzida, to become a son or daughterof “God” may be one originally ingeniously contrived by his father Enki, toallow mankind to continue on its course to becoming a full-blown, geneticallyfreed Niburian archetypal citizen, a son of Enki or a daughter of Isis, for thelucky ones destined to partake of the bread and waters of eternal life, whoseaccess is closely guarded by those who from Nibiru to Earthcame………………………………………………………………....

Gerald is the author of several papers in the communications andelectronics field and is well known for his work in the San Diego hightechnology industry, awarded several patents in the Free Space Optical LaserCommunications Field while serving as Vice President of Engineering, LightPointeCommunications, Inc. Gerald’s career involved companies like Loral Telemetryand Instrumentation where he lead the final design phase of the GlobalstarTelemetry and Command Modem designed for Qualcomm- designed to command, monitor,and control 54 LEO Satellites. While serving as VP Engineering at Tiernan Communications, Gerald and his smallteam of hardware and software engineers were credited with “Digitizing AmericanTelevision”, having demonstrated the first live HDTV Monday night football gameon-air transmission from New York to the world using Tiernan Communications,Inc. HDTV 720p MPEG-2 Encoders.During the years 1996-2002, working as a telecommunications executive, Gerald’sbusiness travels took him to various parts of the world exposing him to aplethora of cultures which acted as a catalyst for his research in the earliesttechnologies and accomplishments including the cultures of Mesopotamia and thesurrounding areas of Turkey, Egypt, Persia, and Iraq, eventually leading to thecuneiform inscribed tablets left by the Sumerians.As a Chief Warrant Officer (CWO2) and helicopter pilot in the United StatesArmy, 1982-1989, Gerald’s duties included night vision goggle and instrumenttrainer as well as acting as the unit’s master fitness trainer.

Knowledge of the Anunnaki here on Earth, both in the ancient past their presencehere and now, is being fully-disclosed around the world. My hope is that thisbook will help the billions of primitive workers, left to fend for themselves ona hostile planet, to find hope that following the great destruction underway,wrought by the warring gods of Light and Dark, a promised peace in the new ageof Aquarius is dawning, actually already upon us. I am excited about sharing this research with like-minded collaborators authors,film makers, and seekers of the truth.
