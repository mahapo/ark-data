[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Special Preface We must be cautious of the hubris of the present. When UFOs first appeared in numbers during the great flying saucer wave of 1947, few people made the jump to an extraterrestrial hypothesis. The subject of this book, Alfred Loedding, is signifi cant because he did eventually lean toward that assumption. Because he played such an instrumental role in the first official Air Force investigation into the phenomena, it is important to anal yze the progression of his theories. For the best part of the summer of 1947 most serious minds studying the flying disc mystery, like Alfred Loedding, considered that a domestic secr et project might account for the sightings. After eliminating that possibility, the \"foreign origin\" option was exhaus tively explored. By 1948 foreign origin became a catch word for visitors from outer space, but in 1947 it meant only one thing— Russians. In fact, worries that the Soviet Union may have gleaned a Nazi s uper weapon at the end of the Second World War remained in the minds of Air Force officials up through 1952. But by late 1947 some aeronautical engineers, like Alfred Loedding, began to cons ider that \"flying saucers\" may represent intelligently controlled machines from another world. Why? What was the mind set in 1947 that could rationalize such a conclusion? What was his pe rspective? Where was the proof? It is very difficult with our 1998 view of popular culture to consider a time when there was no extensive set of preconceptions on ex traterrestrial life. Without a Stev en Spielberg to help us dream, or a Star Wars trilogy and a thousand other such productions dating back to 1949, we would not have the present-day mind set that we do. Yet, that is not to say there was not already some basis for the consideration of alien visitation. The best way for us to understand one early perspective is to look at Halloween night 1938. During that famous evening the dramatic actor Orson Welles produced and narrated a radio drama based on H.G. Wells' book, The War of the Worlds. Like the famous account of a Martian invasion, the radio play was a frightening success. Unfortuna tely for many East Coast listeners, it seemed so real that thousands flew into a panicked frenzy —actually believing aliens were landing in Grovers Mill, New Jersey. The nation was certainly in a vu lnerable state of paranoia due to the brewing storm clouds in Europe. The Second World War would begin just one year later on September 1st and Americans knew that they would soon be impacted by Hitler's madness. 2 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Many authors have used the panic cause d by Orson Welles' radio drama as a foretelling explanation for later UFO sightings. In other words, a belief has arisen that the radio drama planted a seed in the public's mind—a se lf-fulfilling prophecy fo r extraterrestrial visitation. The historian, however, will realize the concept of extraterrestrial life had already been firmly ingrained in the public's mind since 1894 when Percival Lowell founded the Lowell Observatory near Flagstaff, Arizona. Lowell believed he saw signs through his hu ge telescope of canals on the Martian landscape -- proving to him the existence of intelligent life th ere. Some scientists agreed while others were skeptical, but until the first Mars probes of the 1960s and 1970s showed just how lifeless the planet's surface actually was, many people kept an open mind about the possibility. UFOs, never the less, continued to be seen after we realized the near plan ets were uninhabited. Why? UFOs are just that, unidentified objects in th e atmosphere. Most of these turn out to be identified"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"or IFOs—always representing something of physical reality regardless of what they turn out to be. For years debunkers have tried to use science fic tion stories as an impetus behind UFO reports. But the stimulus for the sightings is real, not imagin ed. Orson Welles had no more responsibility than Percival Lowell for UFOs because as Alfred Loedding finally realized, whatever they represent, they are a real phenomena. True, no proof has surfaced to tell us what the UFO phenomenon represents. The continuing record of sightings detailed in this book will demonstrate clues to its anomalous nature just as it did to Loedding. In the case of UFOs it seems the truth may be very extraordinary. That, at any rate, is what Loe dding came to suggest. And for that reason it is perhaps best to remember the words of the late Dr. Carl Sagan w ho stressed that finding such extraordinary truths always requires extraordinary evidence. Unfortunate ly, if Loedding ever did come across conclusive evidence, it has not yet been discov ered. As a result, this book studi es the events of 1947 that we do know and presents them just as Alfred Loedding lived them. We can not disavow that Loedding might ha ve had some cultural preconceptions in the back of his mind. He did draft a formal conclusion to Ai r Force officials in mi d 1948, stating that flying discs may represent extraterrestri al visitation. But, he based his famous Estimate Of The Situation draft on fact, not fiction. It was, however, rejected in part due to fears of generating another War of the Worlds fiction-like panic. Beyond that no one can say if popular culture tainted the history of man' s modern interpretation of UFO sightings. The point for the sake of objectiv ity had to be presented. Following is presented the story of Alfred Loedding and th e great flying saucer wave of 1947. Introduction The morning of July 4th, 1947, at 3733 Shroyer Road Dayton, Ohio, began very peacefully. An initially hazy dawn yielded to a blue sky and a sunny but muggy day of eighty-one degrees. With the after effects of the Second World War still being felt, the nation we lcomed the long and bright three- day holiday despite the heat. It felt strange, however, for Alfred Christian Loedding not to be at work on a Friday morning. Loedding was a civilian aeronautical engineer at the well known Army Air Force labs just down the road at Wright Field. He was also a workaholic who lived and breathed aviation. Yet for all his talents, re laxing at home was not one of them. His son, Donald, remembers his father al ways doing something when at the house. So maybe that morning he was hard at work cleaning and tuning his prized 1946 Buick. Maybe he was down in the basement working on a host of experiments that over the years made him one of America's first Army-employed engineers to study rocketry and je t propulsion. Alfred prefe rred to be designing away in his cellar as to be anywhere else. His home-spun research did pay off over the y ears, giving him the experience needed to start the first jet propulsion division at Wri ght Labs and file a whole host of patents. One of these even included a design of a low aspect ra tio (flying wing) aircraft — anot her one of Alfred's specialties. It is, in fact, becaus e of his cutting-edge innovative br illiance that we would like to know Alfred's exact thoughts. Undoubtedly sometime duri ng that Independence holiday he stopped to pay close attention to the news. Since June 24th there had been a small number of unique stories in the press concerning sightings of unidentifiable flying objects. At the time these were coined \"flying discs\" or \"saucers\" after pr ivate pilot Kenneth Arnold likened the nine objects he saw over the Cascade Mountains to \"saucers sk ipping across the water.\" No one then used the phrase UFO so \"saucers an d discs\" became the catch words. But it was not until that Independence day weeken d that the sightings dramatically increased in intensity and started to dominate news headlines . West Coast newspapers were th e first to detail the stories,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"although, by Sunday of that weekend even the New York Ti mes had a page-one feature on the discs and would do so for the next three days.

It was back in 19 32 that Loedding, together with his wife Marion, saw som ething that they never coul d explain. A Dayton, Ohio, news arti cle detailed their incident as follows: In Octobe r, 1932, the c ouple saw such an object one evening while dr iving near Pl ainsb oro, N. J., he repor ted.

Yet it would be fun to have read the m ind of this brilliant engineer who had graduated the Daniel Guggenhe im School of Aeronautics back in 1930. This is especially im portant because Alfred had been privately design ing flying wing-shaped airc raft (then term ed low aspect ratio) and lecturing about the concept with a slide show since his 1932 sighting.

Chapter One The Famous Flying Saucers In the summer of 1947 the phrase \"flying saucer \" entered the vocabulary of popular Am erican culture. Before this period there were som e rare a nd unverifiable stories of di sc-shaped aircraft seen around the world, but only a few signi ficant reports of any kind cam e to light after a series of so- called \"phantom \" airship\" sightings in Am eri ca around 1886 and 1887. The truly notable incidents, although not really describing sa ucers, centered around the \"f oo- fighter\" of W orld War II and mysterious \"ghost rockets\" over Sweden in 1946. By 1947, the fa mous saucers had arrived and w ere here to stay."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" W hen the sightings hit the headlines, they almost exclus ively described flying objects in the shape of discs. Actually, when the prim ary acc ounts of m any of these reports are studied, the researcher reads stories more descriptive of Al fred Loedding' s favorite obsession—flying wings or delta and swept-wing shaped aircra ft. Such aerodynam ic for ms did e merge at th e end of W orld W ar II and without doubt generated num erous flying saucer reports.

For that reason it is u nderstand able w hy Alfred Loedding becam e a chief player in the dram a surrounding the early history of UFO sightings. By this period he was often seen running between the buildings at W right Labs carrying his work ing m odels of an all-wing lifting body airfoil. Loedding hoped his design would eventually prove to be th e ideal concep t for ligh t private aircraft. He envisaged a day when sm all flying airfoils would even 8 Alfre d Loeddi ng and The Great Fl ying S aucer W ave o f 19 47 replace the f amily car. 1 Today we may laugh at his planned application f or such a design, but at the tim e Loedding was justly respected for his interest in th e con cept of a sau cer-sh aped airfoil. This becam e all the m ore relevant by late June 1947 when \"real\" flying saucers we re being seen in the skies of America. No one knew what they represented, but m any were seeking answers from Am erican scientific experts. Alfred L oedding thus entered the flying disc mystery of the great UFO wave of 1947."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Pictured above are ac tual blueprints of a saucer -shaped aircraft designed and paten ted by Alfre d Loe dding. Loedding, with his background in radical ae ronautics as well as jet propulsion and rocket design was a logical resou rce to utilize, as little persp ect ive then existed for what was being seen. Jets, of course, were still fairly new and posed a possible solution to the m ystery. The Germ an jet and rocket planes that c ame into ser vice a t the ta il end of th e war startled even experienced pilo ts n ot only for their swept-wing design but also fo r the absence of a propeller. Thos e Germ an aircraft along with the British Meteor and Am erican P-80 jet fighters had speeds exceeding 500 miles p er hour. Such speeds, even two years after the wa r, still attracted great attention. But jets c ould account for only a few of the many saucer sighti ngs that summer—which often i nvolved velocities accurately calculated by qualified observers at greater than 1,000 m iles per hour. Neither could other new aircraft designs ans wer all the q uestions raised by the disc m ystery despite the f act th at both the Germ ans and Allies had experimented with the flying wing concept.

Balloons, although a much lower level of te chnology, generated other repor ts as scientists began using this old invention by the thousands to c onduct weather and cosm ic ray studies of the stratosphere in the 1940' s. The early balloons we re m ade from neoprene w hich would turn sm oky gray or black in the sunlight—jus t as som e witnesses of suspected flying sau cer events described seeing. The m ilitary and their civ ilian contractors also used balloons for a whole host o f research an d intellig ence gathering du ties. By Ju ly of 1947 m any of these were no lon ger sm all gas bags, but h uge silver (and som etim es clear) plastic envelopes m ade from polyethylene. These f would appear cone- shaped before their helium gas expanded and rounde d out their internal volum e at high altitude. Many tim es these and the older, neoprene balloons were tied together in clusters which could resem ble form ations of discs. Som e of these larg er polyethylene balloons c ould be seen by the naked eye at altitudes as high as 60,000 f eet. Many saucer sightings, especia lly after a lot of news play on the subject, were undoubtedly the resu lt of balloon launches. Perhaps as m any as seventy percent of all early UF O sightings are attri buted to balloons. Yet, balloons cannot explain away, accounts of flying-wings or discs with extrao rdinary flight characte ristics. Loedding soon learned this as he talked to balloon experts who ha d disc sightings them selves. The disc reports cam e from all over North A merica and around the w orld in 1947. Many were seen traveling at trem endous speeds, flying ex trem ely high, som etim es h overing, and on num erous occasions m aking contro lled ch anges in their flig ht path. These cases rem ain a m ystery because 10 Alfred Loeddi ng an d Th e G reat Fl ying Sauce r Wave of 1947 missiles of the day were only bei ng tested in specific designated areas and had little en durance o r range.

Aircraft, on the other hand, had not yet attain ed reliable m eans of reaching supersonic speeds, altitu des above 4 0,000 feet, or develop ed m ethods to hover. Because a large percentage of the first disc sightings occu rred during daylight hours, astronom ical events are difficult to associate with any but a few of th e reports.

Accounts from reputable witn esses during th e tim e are also significan t because th ey had not yet had the opportunity to have their observations tainted by a vast body of previously"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"published UFO lore. The military started a formal UFO inves tigation by the end of 1947, a lthough, as early as July Army Air Force and Naval Intelligence as well as the FBI had studied some of the more well publicized reports. Loedding was associated with inve stigations out of Wright Field by July 9th, yet few records remain of this work. As in later wa ves, however, only a small percentage of the total number of sightings were reported to authorities. Less than five percent of the 1947 incidents were even indexed in military files. 2 Many of those can be found in the National Archives' holdings of USAF Project Blue Book files. 3 Some paperwork dealing with UFOs are also located at the Air Force Historical Center at Maxwell Air Force Ba se near Montgomery, Alabama, which primarily deal with records of the Fourth Air Force. Nine hundred and ten pages of lost Air Force documents from the late 1940s have also come to light from the National Records Center in St. Louis Missouri—via Wright-Patterson Air Fo rce Base. Microfilms of early in telligence files have surfaced as well but are now held in priv ate hands although are becoming avai lable for sale to researchers. Recently released FBI files provide a very good insi ght into some of the early investigations too. Despite dedicated efforts to locate Naval records containing UFO cases by historian and researcher Jan Aldrich, these files are in large part still missing. Another very good source dealing with 1947 comes from a book by Ted Bloecher entitled Report on the UFO Wave of 1947. In his work Bloecher surveyed 853 North American newspaper accounts of flying saucer sightings. Regr ettably, many of those stories we re not taken seriously by the newspapers themselves and lack details. In fact, af ter some news play on the subject a great deal of silliness arose in the press. Often it becomes hard to weed out the serious stories from that madness. Because most accounts were not followed up on at the time, the articles remain as the only documentation to many of the early UFO sightings. Chapter One---The Famous Flying Saucers 11 The authors are indebted to the help of Jan Aldrich for a nu mber of the news accounts to follow. Mr. Aldrich is engaged in a compilation known as Project 1947 that significantly expands on Bloecher's work. Aldrich has screened over 3,200 North American newspapers and others from all over the world for UFO reports. Aldrich's recent book, Project 1947: A Preliminary Report On The 1947 UFO Sighting Wave, is by far the most extensively researched publi cation available on the period. Today his work continues, searching ou t UFO accounts long lost in over 11,000 newspapers that were in print in the United States alone in 1947. When readi ng those accounts it is important to realize that UFOs were still not yet called unidentified flying obj ects. As stated, the term UFO simply did not yet exist. The media dubbed th e strange objects \"flying saucers\" and \"discs\" following the Kenneth Arnold sighting. Those terms would predominate in the popular press until well into the 1950s. The most important historical hindsight a reader can possess concerns the nature of what flying saucers then represented. Very fe w made the assumption that these discs represented extraterrestrial intelligence. Belief in so-called \"alien visitation\" did not mature until 1949 and then mainly in the cinema and tabloid-like magazines printed on pul pwood paper—\"the pulp fiction.\" In 1947 flying saucers were assumed to mean scientific balloons or most likely classified military test craft. What else could a rational individual who had just lived through the wa rtime environment of secret weapons development think? Most people just hoped they were American and not Soviet— especially the military. Loedding thought likewise. At first he gave great wei ght to the consideration that the Soviets may have acquired some lost Nazi technology. It is interesting to note, however, that Loedding eventually became one of the first in offici al circles to conclude th at the flying discs could"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"represent controlled extraterrestri al spacecraft. His chief, Colonel Howard M. McCoy, even said that November, \"The possibility that th e reported objects are vehicles from another planet has not been ignored.\" 4 But that was not a topic of discussion in the summer of 1947. Although saucers were indeed very hot news by early July, they were not the only focus of the nation by any means. The Cold War had begun to heat up in late 1946 as tensi ons grew tighter each day. In that year, while responding to an invita tion from President Truman to speak in Fulton, Missouri, Winston Churchill brought the phrase Iron Curtain into gene ral use. Although voted out of office by that point, his beloved Br itain then had to institute bread rationing in order to export enough grain to keep food riots from erupting in Allied occupied Germany. That was a hardship English 12 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 citizens had not even had to endure during the dark est days of the war. Subsequent pressure on Parliament led Britain to abandon efforts to check Communist expa nsion in the eastern Mediterranean. President Truman felt America had to fill that vacuum. To drum up Congressional support for aid to Greece and Turkey as well as aid to Europe, the Truman administration intentionally exploited public anxiety. The battleship Missouri sailed to the Mediterranean. 5 But as the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan took shape in 1947, real fears over a blockade of Berlin were already in the news. The Berlin Crisis would only be a year off. President Truman w ould send a flight of B-29 bombers to England the next summ er to dissuade ongoing Soviet thre ats to close the divided city from the West. The B-29s had no nuclear weapons, but the administration made every effort to suggest that they did. In fact, when the (Army) Air Force and t hus Alfred Loedding officially became involved with UFOs, they did so largely out of fear of foreign, but earthly, intrusions into American air space. The American military, after all, had alr eady started mapping Soviet defenses on the Siberian frontier via the North Pole in converted B-29s. R ecently declassified Air Force files even document US efforts to locate land masses in the Polar regi on that could be used for bomber bases. When the British later flew nighttime radar mapping reconnai ssance missions over major Russian cities with American RB-45C jets out of England, it only stood to reason that the Sovi ets would try to do the same. 6 The crucial point so often missed, concerns the significance of the 1947 sightings. If the nation believed they were seeing experi mental aircraft or spy planes, then they were in fact seeing something. Today we know they were not Soviet —the USSR made no early incursions into continental US air space. But wh at were they? Undoubtedly many were misidentifications of domestic aircraft, balloons, and astronomical ev ents—probably as many as eighty percent. But even the military came to the conclusion that there was a disturbing number of unexplainable events. By September 1947 Air Materiel Comm and, Wright Field, commander, Li eutenant General Nathan F. Twining, produced a memo based on research which Loedding assisted wit h. It characterized the discs as \"real and not vi sionary.\" Future Air Force Intelligence Chief Major General Charles P. Cabell even stated in regard to the discs, \"The conclusion appears inescapable that some type of flying object has been observed.\" Wright Field Intelligence Chief Co lonel McCoy then concurred, \"it is obvious that some types of fl ying objects have been sighted.\" 7 "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Chapter One---The Famous Flying Saucers 13 From July 4-11, 1947 UFO reports dominated the newspapers, often featuring flying saucer sightings on their front pages. The stately New Yo rk Times ran four continuous days of page-one features starting on July 6th, this at a time when editors jealously coveted space for stories dealing with Berlin, the Marshall Plan, and serious fl ooding in the Midwest—which was a significant domestic news story. National Gu ard air units, the Army Air Force, and Navy were sufficiently concerned to send up \"saucer patrol s\" along the Pacific Coast. That's significant alone because the regular military then had what they perceived to be a need to conserve fuel for upcoming Air Force Day celebrations. The sightings attr acted such attention because most of them took place in broad daylight. This stood in great contrast to earlier an d later UFO cases, many of which occurred at night or generated vague descriptions of objects that ap peared so luminous or di stant that they did not seem to be of substance. During this period many accounts describe very solid-looking objects maneuvering with the performance that some aircraft lack today. The re ports do not all involve flying wing and saucer-shaped craft. The 1947 wa ve encompassed a great variety of observed phenomena including cigar-shaped rocket-like obj ects. Other forms include luminous balls, fan blades, boomerangs, triangles, diamonds, and light phenomena. Sightings suddenly slowed in frequency af ter July 11th. Several dozen notable sightings would follow to end out the year, but whatever happene d took place primarily be tween June 24th (and in force from July 4th) to July 11th. Granted, after the 11th, the news media did seem to lose interest in the story, but this alone cannot account for the marked decrease in reported activity after that initial onslaught of sightings. Some sort of phenomenon pre dominated in those very critical days of late June to early July. Many claim it to be a form of mass hysteri a generated by the widely publicized Kenneth Arnold sighting. If so, why did the sightings encompass the entire globe in a matter of only days with too little time for most people in forei gn countries to read news accounts of the first American saucers? Why were there sightings before Arnold's? Would Arnold's story have become so publicized if not for actual incidents immediately following his event? Why did th e intensity of the phenomenon end so suddenly after the 11th? If people were indeed caught up in a worldwide craze generated by media coverage, would not large numbers of reports still come in on the 12th instead of dozens the day before and only a handful until 1948? These same questions were asked by Alfred Loedding. The facts that follow are those that became available to Loedding during the course of 1947. Many of the UFO incidents of that year will be shown to result in specific actions taken by the military to formulate an investigation. That investigation, in large part, b ecame the brain child of Alfred Loedding. 1. Trenton (New Jersey) Sunday Times-Advertiser, 10 October 1954. 2. Research conducted by Jan Aldrich.

In all of these curious events he described seei ng a \"silver disc\" with distinct differences in shape and performance to that of a balloon. At some point after the events he reported the incidents to his superiors. The last sighting occurred one April morn ing when Minozewski and hi s staff caught sight of a very bright metallic elliptical disc while they we re tracking a small \"Pi Ball\" (or wind measuring) meteorological balloon then at 15,000 feet. He checked his observati ons through a theodolite telescope. (A theodolite is an optical device used for measuring horizontal and vertical angles—in this case used to track weather balloons.) The disc flew just below the ball oon and remained in sight for fifteen seconds, appearing much bigger than th e balloon with a flat level bottom and a dome on top. It remained on a westward heading at high speed until vanishing off into the distance. 2 Chapter Two---Before Kenneth Arnold 15 For some unexplained reason disc sightings of ten occurred in connection with balloon tests. It is ironic, because if it was not for the presence of highly trained balloon men in those instances, no one would believe the observations to be anything othe r than misidentifications of their own balloons. For that reason, and the expertise of such men, Loedding took special interest in all investigations involving balloon technicians. As another side note, it should be mentioned that there is some mystery concerning the Minozewski sightings. In January of 1967 research er Ted Bloecher reviewed the Minozewski case file at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, thanks to the assistance of Lieutenant Colonel George P. Freeman Jr. who arranged his visit. Bloecher 's associate, atmospheric physicist Dr. James McDonald of the University of Arizona, then contacted Minozewski to confirm the details of the report with him. Minozewski recounte d the fine points of the case just as they appeared in Air Force files but was baffled because he said he had never reported the incidents to the military. Equally perplexing is the fact that the Minozewski sight ings are not now part of the Blue Book index released to the National Archives nor does the case file appear as complete as when Bloecher reviewed it thirty-two years ago. 3 As will be demonstrated in this chapter, it is apparent that sometime during or after the close of the twenty-t wo year long Air Force investigation into UFOs that followed 1947, a conscious effort was made to downplay any sighting which occurred prior to"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"the Kenneth Arnold incident. Those after Arnold's sighting were then often claimed to be the result of simple hysteria generated from his highly publicized account. Only a few very sketchy reports can be found in May in any type of records, most without exact dates or times. Few of these came to the attenti on of the early investigat ors like Loedding, because they were not recorded until after the Kenneth Arnold sighting, and only then detailed in obscure newspaper articles. Others were not documented until private researchers started doing investigative work years later. For example, a Mrs. H.G. Olavic k (later Rawlins) recalled to Dr. James McDonald in 1967 that she witnessed ten flying discs make some curious aerial maneuvers near Tucson, Arizona, on or about May 5th of 1947. One of those objects appeared larger than the other nine discs, perhaps as big as 100 feet in diameter. Viewed with her former husband, they both agreed at the time that the discs must be some sort of new high performance military aircraft. As they watched, the nine smaller craft began \"playing around the cloud\" in violent aerial maneuvers for about seven minutes as if making mock dogfights. Finally regrouping in a V formation behind the larger craft, they flew off with tremendous acceleration 16 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 toward the northeast. 4 FBI files document another sighti ng on May 5th between Ellensburg and Seattle, Washington. In that case three men sight ed at 3:30 P.M. PST a silver object streaking erratically across the sky at great height and leaving a long pillar of \"gas\" which remained in the sky for over thirty minutes. 5 Bloecher documents in his book a sighting by Mrs. W.C. Clark, of Memphis, Tennessee, who reported seeing two flying objects shaped like \"tenni s balls\" pass over her yard around the first of May. 6 Another woman, Mrs. Slawuta, reported that on May 10th she saw a flying \"shining elliptical object\" with a gold band around it head ing east over Newark, New Jersey. 7 This would be one of the first that Loedding might have taken keen intere st in because of the f eature of a central ring— perhaps structural in nature. None of these early reports came to nationa l attention until after the Kenneth Arnold sighting in June. A few were then investigated by local military intelligence officers. In the following case an Army Air Force security officer out of Tinker Fiel d, Oklahoma, made a report and later the incident was reinvestigated by the FBI. This particular sigh ting impressed the military due to the reliability of the witness, Byron Savage. A businessman and private pilot from Oklahoma City, Savage observed sometime on or about May 17th to the 21st a shiny disc-l ike object flying over th e city. It was dusk, at the time of the sighting as Savage and his wife had just started to walk out to their car. At first he commented to his wife that a big white plane was coming over. He c ontinued to watch the craf t because it soon became evident that this thing was no ordi nary aircraft. The object was as bi g as six B-29 bomb ers! It flew between 10,000 and 18,000 feet toward the northwest at a speed estimated at more than three times that of a jet, which in those days flew about 500 miles per hour. The disc reportedly made no noise except for a very faint \"swishing so und.\" It passed over in a matter of fifteen to twenty seconds and had the appearance of a \"per fectly round and flat\" frosty white elliptical object. 8 Savage stated to FBI investigators that \"he was su re this object was not a meteor and in his opinion it must be radically built and powered, probably atomic.\" 9 This was one of the first reports that ended up in Wright Field's (later the Blue B ook) records, when Loedding bega n gathering all the paperwork he could on the flying disc mystery. Similar objects appeared over Manitou Spri ngs, Colorado, on the 19th when witnessed by Pike's Peak Railway mechanics Dean A. Hauser (a navy"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Chapter Two---Before Kenneth Arnold 17 veteran), Ted Weigand, Marion Hisshouse, T.J. Smit h, and L.D. Jamison. They were on their lunch break around 12:15 P.M. MST as the men noticed so me sort of shiny metal-like craft overhead. It flew around the area for over twenty minutes making er ratic aerial maneuvers that no aircraft they knew of could undertake. 10 While the news accounts on this incident are br ief, a very interesting rema rk in one of the stories indicates that representati ves of the 15th Air Force, then part of the Army Air Force, interviewed the rail workers on June 29th and sent their findings to Washington. This would certainly be one of the first indications of military interest in a UFO sighting. In fa ct, those who had the opportunity to view the Air Force files before they were released to the public in 1976 speak of th is as one of its cases. Today, however, the file along with a notable number of other early cases is officially \"missing.\" The National Archives lists them in the Air Force i ndex but do not have them in their collection of declassified files turned over to them by the military in late 1975. Loedding had obviously been privy to it once he persuaded the Pentagon to send its UFO files to Wright Field in September of 1947. Unfortunately, further details of th is case are lost with many others. A more obscure sighting that even Loedding may not have heard about occurred around the 19th when an Augusta, Georgia, physician, Dr. Golden R. Battey, spotted four discs at 11:00 A.M. EST while fishing in St. Helena Sound near Beaufort, South Carolina. Battey st ressed how bright they looked and related that the craft traveled at an a ltitude of more than 20,000 feet in a southeasterly direction. He said they were spinning on their axes with a circular rim ar ound their lower quarter as they silently moved by in less than twenty seconds at great speed. 11 Two flying discs accounts are found for the fi rst day of June but like almost all of the early sightings, were not reported until after the Kenne th Arnold incident. Yet these did later make numerous newspaper stories and were undoubtedly read by many including Alfred Loedding on or by the 6th of July. One of these came from housewif e Mrs. C.W. Parks in Bakersfield, California, who saw two groups of ten flying discs each moving at high speed in a southeasterly direction on June 1st. 12 That night another housewife, Mrs. Inez Nostrant, observe d numerous bright luminous plate-sized objects flying in groups of twos and fours as high as planes over Grand Rapids, Michigan. 13 On the 2nd of June private pilot Forrest Wenyon saw a jar-shaped rock et-like object fly across the nose of his aircraft at great speed near Lewes, Delaware, heading in an easterly direction around his own altitude of 1,400 18 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 feet. Wenyon reported his observation to the CAA, Eastern Airlines, and the FBI because the object was spotted in commercial airline space. There was some speculation on his part that there could have been a connection to a crash of a C-54 from such an object just two days before. The sighting did end up in Air Force records but for whatever r eason was not released to the National Archives when other UFO files were made public in 1976. Earl ier researchers who had the chance to view that file indicate that the military at tributed the sighting to a rocket test. History, however, bears no documentation of rocket te sts over that densely p opulated East Coast area. 14 This is one case in"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"which it would be interesting to know if Alfred Loedding consulted on due to his experience in rocketry. (The Wenyon incident is detailed in recently released FBI records.) That same day Carl Achee, Jr. and John Scales, Jr. observed one circular flying object over Shreveport, Louisiana, along the Red River. This event, like others, were not thought by the witnesses to be of significance unt il they read accounts of the wide ly publicized Arnold account. For that reason those and reports fr om June 10th in Douglas, Arizona , and Weiser, Idaho, on the 12th have received little attention ev en by modern day researchers. 15 Other early accounts come from overseas. According to the Times of India, flying discs were seen over Bombay as early as June 7th with other saucer-like accounts co ming from South America. 16 Disc reports outside the United States are very rare prior to July of 1947, but at 3:30 P.M. local time on June 10th, Hungarian citizen Gyorik Feren ce saw four \"yellow-red platter-like objects\" fly over Budapest. They were sphere-shaped and silver in color, traveling at high speeds. 17 Although it was in the United States that p ilot Richard Rankin, a vetera n flyer with more than 7,000 hours in the air, had the most notable flying sa ucer sighting prior to Arnold's. As with other early witnesses, he did not report it until others like Arnold had admitted to seeing such strange objects. Contrary to later account s of the Rankin Case, his observ ation did not happen on the 23rd, but on the 14th, and did not occur at 2:15 P.M. but at 12:00 noon PST . Nor was Rankin in flight at the time, but saw the objects while watching a bo y mow the lawn outside his friend's home in Bakersfield, California. At the time of the sighting it was a clear and sunny day when both he and the boy saw ten round objects or \"saucers\" fly over in a loose \"V\" formation with one stra ggling in the rear.\" They were heading north, but Chapter Two---Before Kenneth Arnold 19 seven of the discs then revers ed direction and came back over them toward the south. Their diameters appeared to be from 30 to 35 feet, and they were traveling at an estimated speed of 350 miles per hour around 8,500 feet. At the time of the sighting Rankin thought th e craft must be some sort of new Army or Navy test vehicle much like the oval-shaped XF5U-1 \"flying flapjack\" and even commented as much to the lad mowing the lawn. Yet, military intelligence concluded Rankin's sighting represented no known aircraft type. 18 (No XF5U-1 were airw orthy at that time.) 19 Loedding, among others, greatly valued such observations from experi enced pilots. Interviews with Loedding's son in 1997 and 1998 stressed that Al fred took special inte rest in any sightings made by pilots. Although the Fourth Army Air For ce in connection with the FBI first investigated the case, Loedding had a chance to review the Ra nkin file sometime by the end of that summer. Again, it is not known what he tho ught but like other case files he inherited from the Brown and Davidson team, Loedding was surely struck by th e similarities of the incident to others. The hallmarks of these included shiny sa ucer or wing-like obj ects flying fast and sile ntly, often in groups or in special formations. An early such sighting comes from Lansing, Michigan on the 15th at 9:30 P.M. CST which added to the notable early cases: Harry Von Riper was alerted by his landlady, Mrs. Letta Loree, and watched \"balls of fire\" jump in and out among the clouds \"like clay pigeons\" for abou t ten minutes. He tired of watching and returned to the house and did not see them again. He saw a search light beam, but the searchlight was stationary and could not, he thought, cause the phenomenon. 20 That same day, although apparently earlie r in the afternoon, housewife Mrs. H. Ackley saw a"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"very bright silver balloon- like object appear to the northeast of Gering, Nebraska. 21 News accounts tell of another sighting the following day ove r Valley City, North Dakota at 9:00 P.M. CST: Hjalmer Lokken, fireman at the State Teachers Coll ege, reported \"something that looked like a ball, bright red in color [that] went shooting past. It was ab out the height of the flag pole on the college building (approximately 65 feet.)\" It travel ed to the west at terrific speed. 22 20 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 On the 17th a strange round object was s een traveling in a strai ght line over Logan, West Virginia. 23 Then in Dubuque, Iowa, a very unusual sighting took place as described again by a local press account: Mrs. Louis Korn, 879 Rush Street, Dubuque, Iowa, saw over the Mississippi River six objects which all looked the same. They appeared to be two feet long and one foot wide, oval shaped (\"Being deeper than a saucer, more like a shallow cup, with broken handle \") and somewhat vaporous, like a white cloud. They seemed to float gently through the air, visible in each case for about an hour. Mrs. Korn and her husband saw similar objects on the 4th of July. 24 Also on the 17th a disc story comes from Bremerton, Washington, when Mrs. Emma Shingler saw more than one plate-shaped object flying west out over the Pacific at tremendous speed. This incident is interesting because that evening at 6: 00 P.M. PST three flying discs were again seen over Bremerton heading west by Mr . and Mrs. H.K. Wheeler. 25 (Reports such as those, detailing the discs heading out to sea, led Alfred Loedding and the first military investigators to wonder if the objects could have been launched fr om Soviet submarines.) And befo re the night of the 17th ended, Professor Emeritus from the University of Wisc onsin, E.B. McGilvery, spotted a round luminous object heading to the northeast of Madison. 26 The next day on the 18th a notable sighting o ccurred in Green Springs, Alabama, when at 4:00 P.M. CST Mrs. H. Akins with others observe d a blinking disc-shaped craft fly westward. 27 Another less well-known pre-Arnold sighting occurred in Oregon that day when E. H. Sprinkler and other residents of Eugene spotted multiple \"saucers\" in the southwest heading northeast. Sprinkler captured a picture of them. Unfo rtunately, the film revealed only dots because by the time that he had gotten his camera into position, the objects were speeding out of sight at tremendous velocity. 28 On the night of the 19th, from his back ya rd, R.D. Taylor spotted eigh t to ten discs which were lighted from within as they z oomed over Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 29 Mrs. Jerry Neels said she saw some \"bright and shiny\" discs south of Kelso, Washington, on the 20th. 30 Chapter Two---Before Kenneth Arnold 21 That same day Mrs Annabel Mobley and her daughter Luanne observe d three triangular-shaped groups of three discs flying toward the northeast of Hot Springs, New Mexico. 31 Also on the 20th, around 11:00 P.M. PST Archie Edes and his family saw an oval flame-like craft descend at high speed near Moses Lake, Washington. 32 A Spokane woman around the 21st added to the growing list of pre Arnold sightings when she saw eight disc s descending with a \"dead leaf motion\" near the shore of the Saint Jo e River in Idaho. 33 Two other sightings were reported for the 21st but are"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"dismissed as explainable phenomena. 34 Edward L. de Rose had still another ea rly sighting. At 11:30 A.M. EST on the 22nd he reported a \"brilliant, round-shaped silvery- white object\" moving in a northw esterly direction over Greenfield, Massachusetts. It traveled at a high rate of speed somewhere at around 1,000 feet of altitude and streaked across the sky in a matter of only eight to ten seconds befo re vanishing from view. He felt certain the mysterious craft could not have been a balloon and repres ented something very real when later filing this report with the A-2 section of Army Intelligence of the Atlantic Division. 35 That day a very similar sighting took place in Radium Springs , Oregon. In that case a \"flying pie-plate\" was seen by H.E. Hammond and his son L.V.W. Hammond, the secretary manager of the Eastern Oregon Federal Savings and Loan Association. 36 Before the 22nd ended a sigh ting occurred in Tucson, Arizona, when Walter Laos spotted a very strange-looking flying object. 37 On Monday the 23rd at 2:00 A.M. EST a Mississippi woman, Elizabeth H. Hall, awoke to a frightening sight. Outside her bedr oom window that early morning a ve ry bright light grew larger and then receded. She knew that it could not be a star, nor could she determ ine its size or shape. After this pulsating brilliance continued three tim es, it silently disappeared on its fourth cycle. 38 This account came from the same date as that of E.B. Parks and a dozen other witnesses who saw two illuminated discs fly at terrific speed, low over Hazel, Green, Alabama. 39 Later that day at 3:30 P.M. CST, an unusual flying object traveling abou t 150 miles per hour appeared over the mountains 22 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 outside of El Paso, Texas. Dr. G. Oliver Dick son, an optometrist, descri bed how it looked like a blimp with a point at each end. Although unlike a lighter-than-air craft, it remained bright or luminous. He stressed that because \"The sun's rays were not reflected on it.\" 40 Ironically, that night Richard L. Bitters, the editor of a large newspaper, saw strange flying objects over Wapakoneta, Oregon, but sat on his am azing story till after he saw Arnold's account published. 41 (This despite the fact that another similar sighting occurred in Cincinnati that same night.) 42 Thus, neither of those sightings made th e papers before Arnold's account, but one story was actually reported to newspapers on the 23rd. The tale came from a railroad engineer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. As he was climbing off his engine, he observed ten shiny disc-shaped objects flying in a string-like formation, \"like wild geese.\" The six line story it gene rated produced little attention at the time. 43 The public's perception of this strang e new flying disc phenomenon would, however, soon change. 1. Edward J. Ruppelt's personal papers do vaguely detail two fighter intercepts on a \"violently maneuvering\" UFO near England on January 16-1 7, 1947; and an undated post-war account of \"disc-shaped aircraft\" near Habberbishopshiem, Germany.

Chapter Three Kenneth Arnold"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"and The Aftermath From Tuesday, June 24th to July 1 1th, hundreds of flying discs we re seen in every corner of the globe by people of all walks of life. Most rememb er it beginning with a UFO sighting by private pilot Kenneth Arnold. As a result, the Kenneth Arnold Sighting officially ma rked the starting point of what is now called the modern UFO era. It al so initiated Alfred Loedding's emergence into the drama. The incident took place during a flight Arnold made in his small private plane from Chehalis to Yakima, Washington. Shortly into the trip at 2:59 P.M. PST he decided to take some extra time and keep an eye out for a Marine Co rps transport reported down several days earlier. Soon eastward bound at 9,000 feet and nearing the Ca scade Mountains of Washington St ate, he hoped that he might catch sight of it. Instead, he saw something quite different. Something that he would never forget. At a right angle to his aircraft nine very bright disc-shaped objects came into view. They were flying extremely fast in a reversed echelon formation north and to the left of Mount Rainier. At first he assumed they must be some form of new milita ry jet aircraft, but in the clear mountain sky he detected no tail surfaces or wings, just round all wi ng-like bodies. Arnold compared eight of them to \"pie-pans,\" somewhat cloverleaf-shaped, with surfaces so bright they reflect ed the sun like a mirror. The ninth object looked heel- shaped . He then picked up a cowling tool to compare them in size to a DC 4 just off to his upper left at about 1,400 feet. 1 Arnold estimated the discs to be 45 to 50 feet in length, traveling north to south 20 to 25 miles ahead of his aircraft . It was no reflection or mirage because the formation clearly could be seen to weave in and out of mountain peaks at speeds estimated at 1,700 miles per hour! 24. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 He derived this velocity by recording th e time it took the objects to pass the 47 mile stretch between Mount Rainier and Mount Ad ams. Arnold reasoned that the disc formation was five miles in length and passed the 47 mile distance in one minute and 42 seconds. 2 The calculation was simple, but barring minor discrepancies just as equa lly fool proof. Prior to making his computations, Arnold felt certain he could determ ine what type of aircraft they were. Yet these figures defied explanation. No manned aircraft th en in existence flew that fast. Even the new P-80 jets had only reached 623 miles per hour at the Muroc test range in California. Arnold knew aviation well and by then knew equally well that he had witnessed someth ing incredible. Others would soon come to that realization too, but the primary line of thought would not be spaces hips from another world, but some sort of new military test vehicle. Arnold mentioned his sighting to the ground cr ew after he landed in Yaki ma and talked about the incident with Al Baxter, the mana ger of Central Aircraft. While Arnold talked with Baxter in his office they were joined by pilots Les Mills, Carl Apts, and Jacques Filliol. 3 By the time Arnold flew on to Pendleton the story ha d already preceded him. After detailing the sighting to newsmen Bill Bequette and Nolan Skiff at noon on the followi ng day, newspapers soon made famous the term \"flying saucer\" by an off-handed remark of his—co mparing the objects to \"saucers skipping on the water.\" 4 His sighting went on to be the first to r eceive national media attention in more than 150 newspapers, being treated as a seri ous news story. This was due in part to the fact that Arnold was"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"not only an experienced mountain fl yer, but a licensed air rescue pilot, a deputy sheriff, and a respected businessm an. But it is equally im portant to rem ember that the stor y would not have gained the fam e it did unless a host of other saucer si ghtings had not soon followed. Many of the observers to those incidents talked about what they saw before ever hearing news of Arnold' s incident. Arnold' s account has thus often been m islabeled as the first flying saucer encounter m erely because it becam e the first well-known and the first believable sighting. 5 The Army Air Force soon becam e interest ed in Arnold' s account. O n July 12th intelligence officers Captain W illiam Lee Davids on and First Lieutenan t Frank Mer cer Brown inter viewed Arnold for six hours, taking a lengthy detailed statem ent from hi m at Boise' s downtown Hotel Owyhee. Just prior to that, Brown a nd Davidson had tracked down a well-known Ch apter Th ree-- -Kenn eth Arno ld and Th e After math 25 acquaintance of Arnold's, David N. Johnson. Johnson was an aviation reporter for the Boise Evening Statesm an and a widely respected w artim e B-29 bom ber pilot. Johnson gave Arnold a good recomm endation a s did m any others who knew him . In fact, Inte llig ence of ficers too k an imm ediate liking to Arnold — probably due to his aviation background. Brown and Davidson cam e to confide details of other cas es to him because he had exp resse d su ch an inte res t and need to prove his o wn story. Arnold even cla imed that they had told h im that som e in m ilita ry In telligenc e ha d becom e aware of saucer sto ries as early as April. 6 All but one of the objects Ar nold repor ted seeing were s haped like the s ketch above. That first effort to look into the disc s s ighting s by Intellig ence was sp earhead ed b y the A-2 section of the Fourth Air Force out of Ha milton Fiel d, California with Lieutenant Colonel Donald L. Springer in command. Brown and Davidson, under Spri nger' s supervision, woul d draw m ost of the duty, interviewing m any of the early witnesses.

The craft looked to have \"tails\" as they silently flew by at about 1,000 feet toward the southeast. They rem ained in view for about 45 to 60 seconds during which tim e the prospector examined one of them through a hand-held telescope. W ith the aid of the spyglass he could tell they were definitely real objects, round and about 30 feet in diam eter but \"tapering sharply to a point in the head end in an oval shape.\" He also observed som e type of obj ect in th eir tail shif ting f rom side to sid e.

The Portland prosp ector case eventually found its way into Air Force records as the first unid entified case of an eventual 587 offici ally given that designation. (At one time Air Force files listed 701 unidentifieds but today only 587 are noted in th e declassified index.) The unidentified classification (on ce termed unknown) was not lightly given and placed only on files that investigators could not attrib ute to a known cause. Witness reliabili ty also served as a key factor. In this instance the records of both the Army and FBI considered Mr. Johnson of high reliability and character. 9 (See Appendix I for further details.) Lieutenant Governor Donald S. Whitehead of Idaho and Chief Justice J.M. Lampert added to the list of those who saw a strange fl ying object that afternoon. At 3: 30 P.M. MST they viewed from Lampert's office window in downtown Boise a most unusual sight high in th e western sky. Called by some \"The Boise Object,\" it appeared to hover or \"hang\" stationary in th e sky, resembling a \"comet.\" 10 That afternoon at around 2:30 P.M. PST, in Richland, Washington, Leo Bernier reported several silvery-shaped discs high in the sky heading west by southwest. He stated they were traveling as fast as a P-38 fighter or about 400 miles per hour. Bernie r was one of the first w itnesses to suggest an extraterrestrial link. He was quoted in a July 3rd newspaper article, stating: \"I believe it may be a visitor from another planet.\" 11 Two sightings from the 24th reported nine disc-like objects just as Arnold had seen. One came from Charles Kastl as he was walking along a road ten miles east of Joliet, Illinois, at 1:50 P.M. CST. Kastl worked as a railroad engineer and described the nine discs as speeding along in a stretched out line formation at a bout 4,000 feet flying north to south. 12 The other incident was reported by Sidney B. Gallagher at 3:00 P.M. PST in Washington State when he saw nine shiny discs flash by to the north. 13 Then up to eight \"platter-shaped\" discs were seen in loose formation by Lester Swingleson and his wife a nd their two neighbor girls during that afternoon heading northwest from Lonejack, Missouri, toward Kansas City. 14 28.

At 3:00 A.M. EDT Mrs. G.E. Hart saw 13 luminous flying objects shaped like plates fly over Poplar Grove, Pennsylvania. 22 At 8:45 A.M. CST Mrs. Nels Thor of 10436 S Forest Ave. in Chicago, Illinois, observed one disc heading east over Lake Michigan. 23 Sometime after the noon hour that day W.I. Davenport, a carpenter in Kansas City, Missouri, observed nine speed ing disc-like objects just as Arnold did although these made considerable noise and left vapor trails. 24 Near Pueblo, Colorado, Lloyd Lowry and his wife observed two oval-shaped objects spinning on their axis while driving east in th eir car. They noted that the object s came from the east and veered south. Disc sightings involving two or less objects then came from Salem, Oregon; Alvarado, Chapter Three---Kenneth Arnold and The Aftermath 29 Texas, at 5:30 P.M. CST; and Newc omb, New Mexico at 7:00 P.M. MST. 25 By 7:30 P.M. a single bright disc appeared in the skies over Utah and fifteen minutes later Homer B.

The sightin g was made by high school student Larry Jones and two Catholic nuns. 31 In the Arizona Grand Canyon, Dr . Leon Oetinger and three others observed a \"silver ball\" too swift to be an aircraft. 32 At 7:45 P.M. MST in Cedar City, Utah, observers reported seeing one silvery colored disc fly over at about 2,000 feet with great velocity heading eastward. 33 Apparently that same object was seen by Roy Walters, a private pilot who had his sighting while airborne near Cedar City. Roy ce R. Knight, the airport manager at Cedar City, visually confirmed Walters' sighting. Still another man, Charles Moore, told of seeing a single unidentifiable luminous object speed ing east over Cedar City at the same time. Moore was manager for Western Airlines and in his mind dism issed the incident as a \"large meteor.\" 34 Interestingly, far to the north of Cedar C ity a teacher, Glen Bunting and two other independent witnesses, observed a very similar round disc moving eastward just three minutes earlier. 35 By 8:30 P.M.

Detchmendy who reported \"flame-like objects \" over the White Sands proving grounds at 9:50 A.M. MST. 39 Mr. W.C. Dodds then confirmed seeing the same event. 40 And just north of the base at 10:00 A.M., in Captain, New Mexico, Mrs. Cu mmins and her neighbor, Erv Dill, saw a single shiny object that \"seemed to land on nearby hills.\" 41 In fact, at 10:00 A. M. another sighting came from San Miguel, New Mexico, by Mrs. D. Appelz oller who observed a fast moving object at low altitude who also thought it might have landed. 42 Frankly, most researchers feel all of these New Mexico sightings describe an event very charact eristic of V-2 missile tests which were being conducted that year at White Sands. (Four other accounts of unusua l flying objects in New Mexico that day also suggest a rocket la unch or an astronomical event.) 43 The early disc reports were not thought to be attributable to any one specific cause. In general, the stories merely focused on the fact that unusual things were being seen and a number of solutions were posed. The best commentary for the 27th comes from two articles from the San Francisco Chronicle: by Howard W. Blakeslee, Associated Press Science Writer New York, June 27—The reports from five areas west of the Mississippi River about mysterious disc-like objects flashing across the sky agree roughly wi th the way light occasi onally is reflected Chapter Three---Kenneth Arnold and The Aftermath 31 from a distant airplane. In clear air the flash of sunl ight from a plane can easily be seen at 10 miles. This flash is round, the shape of the sun. Any other reflection at a great distance also is likely to be round, coming only from a small area on the plane. Not accounted for are the speeds reported by some observers. A distant plane does not appear to be moving fast. If any jet planes were si ghted, their speeds probably would be noticeable and could fit into the estimates, where si ght gave the impression of something traveling 10 00 miles an hour. It rarely happens that the eye can make an accurate esti mate of speed through the sky. Reports of unusual objects in the sky have been numerou s since the war. Atomic bomb and rocket rumors have accounted for most of them. Speculative stories about what may be seen in the future spread all over the world. With those in mind, any unusual sight in the sky is likely to appear exaggerated. __________________________________________________________________________ Army Colonel Thinks \"Discs\" May have Been Jet Planes White Sands, N.M., June 27 (AP)—Lieutenant Colonel Haro ld R. Turner says \"flying discs\" reported seen in several Western areas Wednesday night may have been jet airplanes. The White Sands proving ground commandant said jet planes have circular exhaust pipe s and that these when heat ed might give an illusion of discs. Reports of new \"flying saucers\" were recei ved today from Silver City, in southwestern New Mexico, and Joliet, Ill. A Silver City dentist and members of his family said they saw a disc half the size of a full moon sail slowly through the sky. A Joliet trai n engineer reported \"circula r objects\" going \"faster than any plane I ever saw.\" 44"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Disc sightings that day also came from El Paso and Houston, Te xas; Lowell, and Tintown, Arizona; Mountain Home, Arkansas; Seattle, Kels o and Woodland, Washington; Rutland, Vermont; and Vancouver, British Columbia. 45 Saturday 28 June A report as unique as Kenneth Arnold's took place this day. The Army, however, paid more attention this time. They did so because it involved one of its own Air Force pilots, First Lieutenant Eric B. Armstrong, who was flying a P-51 fighter from Brooks Field, San Antonio, to Portland, Oregon. 32. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 During that flight while 30 miles north of Lake Meade, Nevada, at 1:15 P.M. PST, Armstrong spotted five to six round white disc s in a close formation. He stated that they were about 4,000 feet below him at an altitude of 6,000 feet moving smoothly at his same air speed of 285 miles per hour toward the southeast. But they must have actually been moving at a faster rate because they soon passed out of sight on an angul ar course to his aircraft. Armstrong estimated that the discs appeared about three feet in diamet er and for that reason the Air Force finally concluded he mu st have seen a balloon cluster. 46 Yet it is known that serious discussion of this incident took place in the Pent agon and seems to have involved Alfred Loedding in some of his first liaison work between Dayton and Washington. Se veral years following the event Edward Ruppelt, when assuming command of UFO i nvestigations in 1951, learned that this had been a notable sighting in the military's early consideration of the problem. 47 At 3:45 P.M. CST that same day just nor th of Milwaukee over Rockfield, Wisconsin, a farmer, Marion Beuschler and his brother, observed seven to ten discs flying silently overhead toward the south. Later that afternoo n identical objects were reported by ra dio news programs in Illinois. Dr. J.W. Abner of Atchison, Missouri, also spotted discs. He reported eight of them traveling in a southerly direction at a high rate of speed. 48 A Colorado farmer, H.E. Soule of Appleton, told Grand Junction authorities that he observed a small disc-shaped object that day come from the northwest, which flew just 200 f eet above his house without maki ng a sound. According to him the disc then headed eastward ove r highway No. 6 for a mile and finally turned southeast. 49 Later that evening a woman in Oregon, Mrs. Sidney Smith and her daughter Joanne, reported seeing an alternately shining flying saucer just before sunset at 5:05 P.M. PST-heading southeast at high speed. 50 Detroit, Michigan, claimed two indepe ndent sightings that day; Los Angeles, California, one at 11:30 A.M. PST; Dallas, Texas, had an observation at 5:00 P.M. CST and another later that night; one that evening in Hooksett, New Hampshire; one in Montgomery, Alabama at 9:20 P.M. CST; and also one in Bath, South Carolina later that night. 51 Chapter Three---Kenneth Arnold and The Aftermath 33 Sunday 29 June"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" In the days following the Kenneth Arnold incident many disc sightings still came from the Pacific Northwest. Beginning at 11:00 A.M. PST on the 29t h Mrs. Morton Elder obs erved seven umbrella- shaped objects south of Pe ndleton, Oregon, flying north and emitting a humming noise. Other independent witnesses reported a similar sighting in the area. 52 That afternoon numerous people in Moscow, Idaho, reported seeing a single \"flying disc\" at 1:30 P.M. PST. 53 At 1:30 P.M. Msrin Tucson, Arizona, Charles Weaver and his wife saw one of the famous formations of discs just as Kenneth Arnold did five days before. 54 One of the most stunning reports for June 29th also comes out of the west. It involved three naval research scientists involve d in guided missile development. While driving to the White Sands proving grounds in New Mexico th e scientists observed something that proved to be far more interesting than the V-2 tests which they were th en working on. Dr. C.J. Zohn reported their amazing observation to Army Intelligence with supporting testimony from fellow sc ientists Curtis C. Rockwood and John R. Kauke. This report was one of the most interesting sigh tings to be studied by Wright Field Intelligence and Alfred Loeddi ng although the investigation was instigated by Lieutenant Colonel George D. Ga rrett of the Pentagon Intelligence Co llections branch. The incident began at 1:30 P.M. MST as the scientists were all in a car headed northeast down Route 17 to examine a launching site for a July 3rd V-2 test. Ju st then they had their attention drawn upward by a flash. All three men, and Curtis Ro ckwood' s wife who was in the car, observed \"a silvery disc whirling through the unclouded sky.\" Kauke was dr iving and became so overwhelmed by the site that he stopped the car. The sc ientists then estimated the di sc's altitude between 8,000 and 10,000 feet and were especially attracted by its bright surface. They agreed its shape appeared elliptical and flat. Dr. Zohn, a well-known rocket e xpert, stated that the object did not look like any rocket he had ever seen and that it coul d not have been a balloon. 55 Later that day at 3:00 P.M. Mr. and Mr s. James Harbor of Richland, Washington, and many local residents saw a very similar shiny di sc with a type of halo around it. Most agreed that its outer edge seemed to be spinning around a stationary center section. 56 34. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 By 4:45 P.M. CST a bus driver, Dale Bays , traveling from Des Moines to Mason City, Iowa, observed flying discs outside Clar ion. At first he saw only one oval object pass across the sky moving south-southwest at about 1,200 feet. Then four similar obj ects followed. Bays quickly stopped and got out for a better look. Taking in the view of the c ountryside, he turned around and spotted in the opposite direct ion a flight of thirteen more discs. This formation was at about the same altitude as the first objects and judged to be tr aveling 300 miles per hour. Th ey looked like \"inverted saucers,\" \"oval\" in appearance. He guessed that they were anywhere from 175 to 250 feet in diameter and around twelve feet thick. Their color appe ared a \"dirty white\" and he said they made a \"motor or dynamo\" type of noise while passing overhead. After a couple of minutes the discs were then lost from sight to the north-northwest. 57 Interestingly, a sighting came from 140 miles west of there near Sioux City, Iowa, just 30 minutes later. The witnesses, H.F. Angus and his wife, saw a silvery disc move rapidly to the south at high altitude. 58 Around 5:30 P.M. CST motorist Mrs. E.D. Butts, her husband, and so n all observed a bright object fly low over St. Joseph, Mi ssouri. Traveling relatively sl ow, it headed southward. They described the event just as if they were looking at the sun pe ering through the overcast on a very cloudy day or like seeing a bright moon. But the day was very cloudy, too cloudy to be the moon. And because the object appeared from the north and moved continually to the south, it came"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"nowhere near where the sun was positioned. 59 Another family, Mrs. HJ. Beckmeyer and her brother E.W. Brown, in St. Louis accounted a similar stor y that afternoon but in this case they saw three bright discs. 60 At 8:05 P.M. PST Mrs. Sidney B. Smith in Seaside, Oregon, added to th e growing lists of reports when she observed a round silent object pass over very high, just east of the city. 61 An hour and two minutes later Frank M. King, his wi fe, and their three guests, watche d an oval gleaming disc fly over San Leandro, California, at great speed between 4,000 and 5,000 feet headed on a northerly course. 62 That day the Associated Press reported dozens of such flying saucer sightings from Vancouver, British Columbia, to El Paso, Texas. The storie s all had similar characteristics—involving fast moving objects shaped like discs or saucers, traveling south at high rates of speed. They made little or no noise and each of the objects were said to have a surface that gave Chapter Three---Kenneth Arnold and The Aftermath 35 off a blinding reflection from the sun. 63 Monday 30 June Occasional mention has been made in this text about Edward Ruppelt. He is of such interest because his landmark book, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, documents not only the great UFO flap of 1952 but also gives many insights on the 1947 saucer wave. Th is is ironic because during the summer of 1947 Ruppelt hoped he had seen the last of the Air Force. In WWII he served a long stint as a bombardier and radar operator during the en tire B-29 bombing offensive against Japan. He certainly had earned his GI bill that he was th en going to school on—having survived some hard combat and winning a fist full of medals the hard way. Now he was working just as hard toward a degree in aeronautical e ngineering at Iowa State College—a happy civilian. That day Ruppelt was in Yellowstone Park, en joying the first lazy holida y in a long time. That's when he heard the new word \"flying saucer.\" Just outside the lodge kids we re sailing paper plates into the air yelling \"saucer, saucer!\" He soon read the news reports which filled him in on the unusual phrase, but little did he real ize that three years la ter he would be back in the Air Force as project head of UFO investigations in Dayton. 64 One of the first sightings Ruppelt read a bout came out of Idaho on Monday the 30th. It began at 2:30 P.M. MST when several observers saw a flight of eight to ten objects in a V formation near the town of Hailey flying toward Gale na Summit. Witness Walter Nichols on stated that the left wing of the V formation contained five disc-shaped objects in perfect line but the ones on the right \"seemed to weave.\" 65 Forest ranger Hunter Nelson, who was mark ing trees with Nicholson three miles from Galena Summit, counted seven to ni ne objects in the V formation. He stated that they were moving ex tremely fast and were as high as 10,000 feet heading northeast. Although both men said the objects were so high that they only looked like shiny specks in the sky, they told UFO researcher Dr. James McDonald years later that they had never seen anything like it before or since a nd were positive they had not seen conventional aircraft. Both men stressed that point, stating that they flew \"much faster than any aircraft of that day.\" 66 36.

Grumpier, a Rogers, Arka nsas, real estate dealer, watched the approach of a strong wind storm. As he steppe d out onto his porch, the clouds became even more dark and ominous. Suddenly a disc appeared out of the north west and vanished rapidly into the southwest. 67 Although it is hard to determine a definite time fo r this report another disc sighting was documented at 6:00 P.M. CST in Tupelo, Arkansas. In that cas e the postmaster, T.A. Morris with Alien Jones and Oscar Jones, observed a silver disc fly toward the northeast at a high rate of speed and great altitude. 68 Actually there were many accounts to come out of the South that night. For example, a round bright object flashed westward over Knoxville, Tennessee, at 8:00 P.M EST. 69 Then at 9:30 P.M. C.E. Brehm, acting president of the University of Tennessee, observed with his wife a bright fiery object resembling \"a long cylinder\" move at terrific speed across the sky in several seconds as it left \"in its wake a shower of sparks.\" He told authorities that \"I've s een many a falling star, but never one that behaved like this thing. It was high in the sky, though much lower than the stars.\" 70 Local residents, Mr. and Mrs. Bellam, saw a similar sp ectacle. Mr. Bellam, who worked at the Oak Ridge nuclear facility, agreed with the other witnes ses and refused to dism iss the sighting as an astronomical event because the alt itude of the object was described as relatively low — in one case 5,000 feet or less. 71 On the 30th disc sightings also came from Arizona, Utah, Oregon, Washington, Massachusetts, and Ohio. 72 Tuesday 1 July On the first day of July Robert E. Johnson, the c ounty juvenile probation offi cer in Tucson, Arizona, reported seeing a disc-shaped objec t fly northward over the Pima Indian Reservation at 9:30 A.M. MST. Johnson stated that it appear ed to be silver in color and moving at great speed at 5,000 to 10,000 feet. He described its flight characteristics as fairly smooth a nd direct, remaining in view for three minutes. 73 By 11:00 A.M. CST two shiny objects we re seen traveling south, very high and fast over Indianapolis, Indiana. 74 Chapter Three---Kenneth Arnold and The Aftermath 37 Much further west Mrs. Herbert Ballie t and her husband then reported seeing two groups of flying discs at 11:45 A.M. PST fl y right over their new house in Portland, Oregon. They said the second group contained ten to twelve objects and flew low over the foothills near the Columbia River. 75 At noon Mrs. R.A. Hunt of Madras, Oregon, saw six \"aluminum\" colored saucers circle high overhead . 76 Forty-five minutes later another Oregon wo man and others in the Astoria, Fort Stevens area told of seeing a bright shiny objec t for 15 minutes moving toward the Columbia River in a northerly direction. A local we lder saw that same object—it being so bright he noticed it through his dark welding glasses. Then other observers sa w the objects and their concern led to phone calls to the Army at Fort Stevens and the Coast Guard at Port Adams. Officials from those facilities, however, stated that they had noted no unusual activity. 77 For some reason Oregon seemed to be a real hotbed of saucer sightings that day. An interesting report came from Mrs. Walter Clark as others in Pe ndleton spotted saucers in a formation of six to eight objects that afternoon. 78 At 12:45 P.M CST a Dallas, Texas, man, Tom Dean, traveling between Dallas and Fort Worth said he and his wife and daughter saw a disc-shaped object \"going like blue blazes from northeast to southwest at cloud level.\" Dean recounted that it resembled a"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"flattened-out balloon as it zoomed by in a matter of only fifteen seconds. 79 Further north in Canada on Prince Edward Island, Dr. and Mrs. C.K. Gunn with two friends saw a strange luminous object traveling at great sp eed high in the sky. 80 Also in Canada over Edm onton, Alberta, at 3:00 P.M. MST, Mrs. A. Olson reported seei ng a \"silver-colored\" craft heading southeast at a great speed. 81 That night in Wallaceburg, Ontario, Ray Stevens spotted a disc flash by with bright luminous flames heading south at 8:45 P.M. EST. 82 In Albuquerque, New Mexico, Chamber of Commerce official, Max H ood, reported \"a disc-like bluish object following a zig-zag path in the no rthwestern sky.\" Between Wilmington and St. George, Delaware, a man observed five oval object s with two short protrusions on their trailing edges. 83 (In some of Loedding's investigations he t ook particular interest in any such notation of control surfaces as in this account and that of Fred Johnson's 38. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 sighting on June 24th.) Between 8:45 and 9:58 P.M. EST three reports came out of North Carolina and one from Kentucky and one from South Carolina. In each ca se one luminous saucer-shaped disc was reported moving rapidly overhead on a southerly course. 84 That same night at 10:10 P.M. CST US meteorologist, E.E. Unger of Louisville, Kentucky, told of seeing a circular object flying through the air as he left a neighborhood theater. He said it moved at least 100 miles an hour and gave off an orange light as it headed toward the southeast. 85 By July 1st Washington DC time, a rada r operator at Chitoze AAB, Mokkaido Japan, detected a target traveling at a speed in excess of 600 miles per hour. This became one of the first notable radar targeted UFO events as the object could not be attributed to any na tural occurring phenomenon. Alfred Loedding was later called to Washington to consult on th at particular case. Pentagon Intelligence concluded during the meeting that it must have been some type of manned \"aircraft\" because it made four changes in heading while on the scope. The event certainly caught the eye of Pentagon brass because very few ai rcraft at that time could reach speeds of 600 miles per hour. In the intelligence report, however, a Major Farrier is quoted as stating that the USSR was then known to possess a jet fighter capabl e of speeds in that range. 86 On this date or near it, passengers and a ship's officer on the SS Llandovery Castle had a very disturbing sighting. At 11:00 P.M lo cal time, while in the Madagascar Straits, they observed a cigar- shaped machine fly parallel to the sh ip just twenty feet above the wa ter. It shined a searchlight-like beam on the water 50 yards from the ship. After a short while the craft flew out of sight without making a noise, but emitted \"fierce fl ames\" as it accelerated away. Passe ngers stated that it looked to be of entirely metal construction with a blunt end and no sign of windows. Although the most remarkable facet of the account involves the size of the UFO—described as four times the length of the ship and about four times its height! 87 Descriptions of \"cigar-sha ped\" craft, sometimes of huge size, have become the second most common feature of unidentified flying objects sightings from 1947 and continuing on to this day.

Then a weather balloon was blamed, but in 1994 they claimed the weather balloon had been used as a cover story for what was actually th e crash of a high alt itude \"Mogul balloon.\" Mogul balloons were part of an extremely se cret project designed to s can for shockwaves in the upper atmosphere, indicating possible Soviet nuclear testing. The only problem with this scenario is that although two Mogul balloons definitely did go down near Roswell, the records of the Air Materiel Command show that these incidents occurre d only on June 7th and July 5th. Aside from that, recently declassified FBI files clearly show that the Mogul project was know of (by name) even by low level intelligence units. By the 6th of July the nearby 509th bomb gr oup was already notified of an aircraft crash of some sort on a nearby sheep ranch. Manager of the ranch, W.W. (Mac) Brazel, had reported the incident to the sheriff's office by the 5th, stating that he found a wide area of ai rcraft-like debris on the morning of the 3rd following a severe storm the night before . (Other accounts state Brazel found the debris in mid June, and still others place his discovery on the 4th of July.) Today there are many sensational stories circulati ng about the Roswell Inci dent. Most are to the effect that the propulsion unit of one or two flying saucers (perhaps after a collisio n) exploded and showered-down the debris found by Brazel. The main body of at least one disc is said to have then crashed, complete with four occupa nts, 75 miles northwest of Roswell. While there are a remarkable number of collaborating stories fr om many of those known to have been involved in the incident, there is no physical evidence to substantiate their claims. 40. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Recently the Air Force posed its fourth e xplanation for Roswell, st ating that test dummies dropped from a high altitude aircraft accounted for the mysterious alien bodies. The problem this time is that the exercise occurred more than tw elve years after the suppos ed incident. And it is no coincidence that the Air Force made this recent re velation on the morning of the 50th anniversary of the Kenneth Arnold sighting—completely ov ershadowing that historic event. Recent discoveries of government documents confirming a saucer crash and even an autopsy film have not been authenticated. These tidbits of evidence, known as the MJ-12 papers and the Santilli film, are nevertheless very intriguing. One thing that makes them so remarkable is that, if they are fakes or hoaxes, they have been done at tremendous expens e utilizing exceptionally specialized skills. Some have even speculated that the most frightening scenario of all would be if the Roswell \"evidence\" was a fake . If so, who or what group would have the finances and resources at their disposal to produce this kind of disinf ormation, and why? And contra ry to popular belief, no UFO hoax has ever produced a profitable outcome for anyone. Few believe the sensational stories, but so mething very real is known to have been collected from the desert by the 8th Army Air Force 509th co mposite bomb group based in Roswell. This is startling for that reason alone because the 509th wa s the only squadron then in existence authorized"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"to carry atomic weapons. Whatever crashed near th is high security nuclear base was then flown to Carswell Army Air Force base in Fort Worth, Texa s, and then to Wright Field (renamed Wright- Patterson AFB by 1948) in Dayton, Ohio. In all likelihood the commanding officer of the 509th, Colonel William \"Butch\" Blanchard, who authorized the release of the \"disc crash\" story by Ju ly 8th did not initially realize the implications of the event. When his intelligence officer Major Jesse Marcel told him they had found the scattered debris of a flying disc, Blanchard probably first thought of a balloon crash or some such explainable event. The Arnold story was only eight days old and still being talked about. On the evening of July 2nd, local retailer Dan Wilmot even had a saucer sighting. In 1947, however, flying discs or saucers had not yet assumed the image of extraterrestrial visitors that they have taken on today. Almost everyone then took it for granted that flying saucer s were research balloons or military experiments of some sort. Colonel Blanchard probably innocently thought their recovered disc would be just one more story added to the many already being reported in the news media. If the debris did come from something terr estrial, but secret, it would make sense that General Roger M. Ramey, commander of the 8th, would have then retracted Blanchard's disc story with a weather balloon explanation. It Chapter Three---Kenneth Arnold and The Aftermath 41 would make all the more sense if it was not just a low-level research experiment as Blanchard probably assumed, but a highly classified project, or a nuclear accident, or perhaps even something of Soviet origin. This would conceal the indication of any such event and thus prevent public embarrassment at a time of mounting Cold War tensions. It would al so conveniently and completely defuse the situation—which it immediately did. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" Press officer Lt. Walter Haut recei ved authoriz ation by Col.

How long would it take for scientists in 1947 to identify crash debris far in advance of current human technology—if indeed some was recovered? Whatever went down near Roswell was id entified by the chain of command quickly enough to stop it from becoming public knowledge. That fact is clear. Someday, perhaps soon, the story will finally come out. 89 Perhaps a spaceship did crash that stormy July night. Playing devil's advocate, it would certainly answer many questions—the mo st perplexing surrounding the question why discs sightings increased so dramatically by July 4th. Perhaps there was a reason for the saucers to come out that day and up through July llth. Were they, in other words, looking for a missing disc? Is that an over simplistic hypothesis? More conventional UFO re ports for this date are now being discovered by researchers. Flying disc reports, for example, came in from various parts of the Columbus, Cincinnati, and Springfield, Ohio, area. 90 (In Cincinnati that evening at 8:00 P.M. EST over a hundred spectators at a baseball game saw two disc move slowly over the field. 91 ) Discs popped up in Lewiston, Idaho; Hot Springs, Arkansas; Royal Oak, Michigan; Rutland, Vermont; DeKalb and Texarkana, Texas; and Denver, Colorado. 92 Chapter Three---Kenneth Arnold and The Aftermath 43 A sighting that day comes from Tehama County, California, rancher Stanley S. Teass who reported seeing a group of eight to ni ne strange objects flying south at high speed near Red Bluff. 93 Other sightings came from California at 2:15 P. M. PST in both San Francisco, and East Los Angeles, and then that night in Huntington Park at 7:10 P.M. PST, and Pasadena at 8:00 P.M. EST. Still more came from Beverly Hills, M ontrose, Tuyunga, and Burbank, California. 94 (The 2:15 event involved State Highway Patrol Sergeant Da vid Menary, of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge detail and passenger Walte r Castro. They reported seeing si x bright metal objects \"about the size of a football\" whiz overhead and fall into the sea.) 95 That same evening two reports came from Sioux City, Iowa, describing three brightly luminous saucer-like flying objects moving in close formation to the southwest. 96 One disc was then seen over Green Bay, Wisconsin, at 6:30 P.M. CST. 97 Finally at 8:00 P.M. PST, Mrs. Margaret Gill observed a \"red ball of fire\" fly over just south of Auburn, Wa shington. Two other women, Mrs. Zamora Lucas and her mother witnessed the same si ght, thinking it was a burning aircraft. In fact, all three witnesses were convinced the craft was in dist ress because they said the object appeared to fall to earth. 98 A report in Oregon at Klamath Falls conveyed an almost identical account. 99 Thursday 3 July By the 3rd, flying saucer reports slowly started to increase in frequency. Beginning in Omaha, Nebraska, at 3:30 A.M. CST Mrs. Fred C. Ne lson saw three objects \"glowing like a full moon.\" 100 At dawn in Texarkana, Arkansas, a bus driver and a fireman reported se eing one disc high above them. 101 Around 9:00 to 10:00 A.M. EST that morni ng up to 100 fishermen saw eight disc-shaped objects maneuver wildly in the clouds over Conowingo Dam in Pennsylvania. 102 "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 44. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 At 10:30 A.M. EST in Lockland, Ohio, a man saw a football-shaped silv ery object heading south at high altitude. 103 By 7:45 A.M. PST a Monterey, Califor nia, housewife observed a glowing round object \"flow over onto its edge\" as it flew by in the course of ten to fifteen seconds. 104 In Denver, Colorado, at 8:55 A.M. MST William F. LeFevre w itnessed a shiny, mirror-like disc zoom by at several thousand feet and make a forty-five degree turn before vanishing toward the southwest. 105 At noon in Cincinnati, Ohio, a housewife caught a gl impse of three discs streaking overhead on a straight course. 106 About the same time a Staten Island ma n, Nicholas Kronyak, observed a ball-shaped silver colored object fly over New York just astern of an aircraft while S.M. Barker saw three discs race eastward over Keokuk, Iowa. 107 Also over the noon hour, a circular object sped over Nampa, Idaho, with an undulating motion as witnesse d by Charles Hughes and Clarence Faust. 108 One of the best for this day involved an astronomer, John F. Cole, who observed at 2:30 P.M. EST ten luminous objects above Harborside, Main e, from his location on the eastern shore of Penobscot Bay. He estimated thei r speed between 600 and 1,200 miles per hour as they passed by in a hazy blue sky toward the northwest. Unlike other in cidents, these objects flew with a loud roar and did not appear to hold any defi nite formation but moved along like \"a swarm of bees.\" Their size appeared to be from 50 to 100 feet wide although two objects in the formation looked to have dark areas that may have been wings. 109 This event comprised one of the first files to make its way to Wright Field, via the Pentagon, and received care ful attention by authorit ies including Alfred Loedding. Intelligence never discov ered a reasonable explanation fo r what Mr. Cole saw that day over Maine and thus marked the case unidentified. Later that day on the other side of the country a Redding, California, couple saw a shiny \"flying triangle\" zooming silently over their state toward the north. 110 An even more startling report came out of California at 5:00 P.M. PST. The incident took place at the Naval Auxiliary Station at Santa Rosa and involved trained observers . The story made quite an impact in the local newspaper when one of those witnesses gave an interview: Chapter Three---Kenneth Arnold and The Aftermath 45 I noticed it first a few minutes before 5 p.m., on Thur sday. From my location, it seemed to be 1,000 feet above the main north-south runway at the airfield, and I would judge that it was 15 to 20 feet in diameter. . . it was impossible to judge size and distance accura tely, because there was nothing about the object that enabled me to make an accurate approximation of size. It was the shape of a giant pocket watch, with out the stem, and it was covere d by silver material that looked like airplane aluminum. There were no marks of any sort on the surface. It was perfectly smooth. The object was moving at about the speed of a glider in normal flight attitude, and indeed on my first glimpse I automatically recorded it in my mind as a glider. But an instant later I realized that there wa s something strange about it an d looked back. Then I noted that it had no wings, no apparent projections of any sort. It moved smoothly in a northerly direction unt il it reached the north end of the runway, then turned to the east, banking slightly and headed toward Santa Ro sa. I was forced to turn my attention away from it for a moment, and when I lo oked again it was gone. From my observation, I would believe that the object was controlled in its flight, either directly or by gyro-control. Its only deviation from a straight path was for wind currents, and after tipping or rising with a current it would recover its level flying position. The recovery was made in much the same manner as a glider appears to recover when a thermal"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"current forces one wing up or down. At the same time, the return to normal was accompanied by an overcompensation effect which is typical of gyro control.\" 111 During the early evening an account came out of St. Maries, Idaho, when eight luminous discs were reported by Mrs. Walter Johnson and her fa mily while she was visiting her parents. The sighting occurred at 6:30 P.M. PST when her fath er Ben Beeman had alerted the whole family to \"come out of the house quick!\" As they all ran outdoor s the family of at least nine saw eight to nine large objects flying from the south in a scattered formation. Mrs. J ohnson said they approached very fast and soon became silhouetted against a nearby mountainside. Mrs. Johnson later told the press that \"s uddenly they stopped in mid-air, then started again. When they reached a point over a clearing in the timber, they stopped again and settled down a few at a time until they were out of sight. The mysteri ous part was that we could see them flutter down into the timber, and yet we couldn't see that they did anything to th e trees.\" She went, on stating that they looked thicker than discs—ac tually more like washtubs but as big as a \"five room house.\" The most interesting part of her acc ount described self-luminescent prope rties. She said they glittered like a mirror in 46. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 the sunlight, but that the sun was apparently obscured by overcast—indica ting the light came from within the craft. Because over a half dozen neighbors also wi tnessed this sight, the event drew a great deal of attention. Benewah County sheriffs deputies made a la nd search of the area a nd three days later the National Guard's 116th fighter group combed the ar ea by air. Despite these efforts no landing traces were ever reported. It is odd that this case never made it into Air Force files because Mrs. Johnson reported the incident to officials at the Spokane Army Air Base when she returned to her home in Dishman Washington.\" 112 Further north that day at 5:45 P.M. ADT , Brenton Clark, a Canadi an farmer near Augustine Cove, Prince Edward Island, witnessed a similar (s ingle) bright round object zooming southward at around 10,000 feet. Before disappearing from view it dove earthward leaving a vapor trail behind it. Neighboring farmer James Harris an d hired-hand Herman Linkletter, near Sherbrooke, confirmed the same sighting. They commented that the craft th ey saw had such a brilliant reflection that its shape was indiscernible. Another neighbor, however , near Charlottestown, Ewen McNeill, clearly described seeing a \"torpedo-shaped object of tremendous speed\" at the time. 113 That afternoon two Walkerton, Indiana, housewives saw several disc s maneuver in circular movements. 114 Then in Arkansas, J.L. Hampton told newsmen he saw a kite-shaped craft going at great speed.\" 115 That same late after noon Robert Jackson and William Baker, retired Navy Chiefs, saw three discs make controlled changes in their flight and circle near the San Diego Naval Air Station. 116 By 5:30 P.M. EST in Greenhills, Ohio, a man saw a silver disc shaped like a football.\" 117 Around that hour in Asheville, Nort h Carolina, four people noticed a star-like object at low altitude headed west. 118 At 5:00 P.M. CST a Waukesha, Wiscons in, city council member and two others described seeing a fifteen foot long, five foot wide, silvery disc fly high overhead toward the north. 119 By 7:00 P.M.

In this case they described them as bright gold and moving very fast in a straight line accompanied by a \"jet-like"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Chapter Three---Kenneth Arnold and The Aftermath 47 noise.\" 120 At 9:30 P.M. EDT Baltimore, Maryland, re sidents accounted for a sighting of a round object that was bright yellow in color and larger and faster than a falling star, heading on an even course from the northwest to the eas t over the course of five minutes. 121 Around 9:00 P.M. EST in Mendon, Vermont, Mrs. Clara Spieski reported that she saw a tubular, luminous, greenish craft flying over low toward the southwest. 122 At 9:30 P.M. CDT a policeman, George Mayfield, west of Springfie ld, Illinois, reported seeing four flat luminous discs zoom by in straight flight. 123 Adding to the nighttime sightings of lu minous discs came reports from four people in Warren, Pennsylvania. 124 Then in Crawfordsville, Indiana, Kenne th Stanford reported five luminous discs going northwesterly at great speed. 125 Claude Price may have seen thos e same objects at that time in Decatur, Illinois. 126 By 10:30 P.M. CST a luminous disc appeared over Sioux City, Iowa, headed east as a yellowish disc was seen in Seattle, Washington, at 9:45 P.M. psr. 127 Ending out the night, a group of luminous discs were seen traveling over Oakland, California, by Mrs. Estelle DeVaughn at great velocity going east. 128 Up to this time the military still had not yet organized any determined investigation at Wright Field of which researchers are aware of. Such work did not seem to begin until at least July 9th. News accounts, however, do show offi cials were considering the issu e if only to issue a few and very contradictory statements. On July 3rd, as de tailed in the Introduction, Army Major Paul Gay nor stated that a preliminary inve stigation had been dropped for lack of evidence. Then Boise, Idaho Statesman, reporter Dave Johnson wrote that the commander of the Air Materiel Command, Lieutenant General Nathan Twining, told him that officials were indeed looking into the matter of flying discs. Twining stated that ev en the top secret res earch conducted at the fa mous aviation labs at Wright Field had not produced technology comparable to that being observed. Continuing, he added that a \"reputable scientist\" ha d seen one of the discs and that his report is being studied. 129 1.

Chapter Four The Onslaught Maybe it all could just be chalked up to fireworks, but on Loedding's day off on Friday, July 4th, Independence Day, a nationwide rash of saucer sigh tings hit the headlines. New Jersey residents started off the long list when \"balls of fire si lently darting through the air at high speed\" were reported between 1:00 and 3:00 A.M. EST. 1 During those same early mo rning hours, further west, Mrs. B.B. Connor of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, sa w a group of star-like obj ects fly through broken cloud layers. She described them as maneuvering in an erratic manner. 2 From sun rise to mid"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"afternoon discs sighting came from Virginia, Idaho, Colorado, Texas, California, Louisiana, and Arkansas. 3 At 11:00 A.M. PST a carload of people dr iving near Portland, Oregon, spotted four disc-shaped objects streaking past Mount Jefferson. Just before that Harry Hale, production manager of the Portland Oregonian, saw a shiny disc-like object in the sky west of Beaverton wh ile driving to work that morning. 4 (Interestingly, around that same time a priv ate pilot flying over Idaho saw a similar disc speeding toward Oregon as a V-shaped objec t was spotted by ground observers in Troutland, Oregon.) 5 These were only the first few of many Oregon reports. The next came at 1:00 P.M. from a Portland radio station employee, Frank Cooley. He and many of hi s co-workers saw disc-shaped objects from the windows of the International News Service o ffice in the Journal building. 6 Don Metcalfe, an employee at the nearby Oaks Amusemen t Park saw the same discs. His superintendent, William LeRoy, also saw them a nd made a report to police. 7 Five minutes later a Portland policema n, Kenneth McDowell, had a sighting. While feeding pigeons behind Precinct House No. 1, he became su rprised to see them suddenly startled away. McDowell looked up and to his Chapter Four------The Onslaught 49 amazement observed five large osci llating discs, two going south, thr ee east. They were traveling at a high rate of speed and looked like nothing he had seen before. This prompted an all-car police alert to re port any aerial objects. Five minutes later the first of many responses came back into headquarters. 8 At 1:10 P.M., for example, two Portland policemen in car 82 near Oaks Amusement Park, Walter A. Lissy and Andrew Fox, who were both civilian pilots and WWII veterans, reported six or seven \"flat, round discs. They were flying at terrific speed in a straight-line formation\" head ed south within 30 sec onds of one another. Lissy said they zig- zagged and made turns so sharp that he knew they could not be aircraft. Ea ch of the objects headed east over the park at great height estimated as hi gh as 40,000 feet. No engine noises or vapor trails were noted, but they did see \"flashes \" of light. The last disc \"fluttered rapidly to the side in an arc\" and they all appeared white against the cl ear blue sky. 9 In Car 13 officer Earl Patterson, at SE 82nd and Foster Road (three miles from Lissy), saw something too. He reported an \"oval whitish aluminum-colored object\" coming out of the west heading southwest at terri fic speed at about 30,000 feet. Patterson, who was a former Army Air Force ve teran, stated that it resembled no plane he had ever seen. 10 Then harbor patrolman, Captain K.A. Prehn, boat pilot A.T. Austad, and patrolman Kent C. Hoff reported to Portland police headquarte rs that they had seen three to six oscillating, flashing discs. These were described as being \"s haped like chrome hubcaps\" traveli ng very fast and high at about 10,000 feet toward the south over th e Globe Mills. The men were uncertain of the exact number of objects because the flashes from the objects were so br ight that they could not stand to stare at them. They did agree that the objects wobbled and osci llated as they flew w ith turning and weaving motions. 11 Numerous Portland citizen s also reported sightings. At 2:00 P. M. \"metallic discs glinting in the sunlight\" were seen across the Williamette River near the Rose Island bridge. Picnickers and a woman pilot saw silvery \"spinning di scs.\" One woman at 4:30 P.M. de scribed viewing an object like \"a new dime flipping around\" over the Sandy Dist rict. Two white or silver objects flew over Portland at 4:58 P.M. heading southeast, and a third passed over at 5:30 P.M.

C ooley, as stated, saw a formation of twelve discs himself as high as 20,000 feet at 1:00 P.M. He declared that they were \"operated and 50. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 maneuverable devices,\" indicating th at the objects were larger than many believed. He continued: \"They plainly experienced maneuvers in the sky. . . At one time a number of the discs would get into formation and fly circles around another disc. It was hard to follow their behavior exactly because of the great height, their gleaming surface and their nature.\" 12 In Milwaukie, Oregon, (due south of Portland) three discs in a line formation were observed flying in a northeasterly directi on by State Police Sergeant Claude Cr oss during that 1:00 P.M. flurry of sightings. Also across the Columbia River fr om Portland near Vancouver, Washington, Clark County Sheriffs Deputies John Sullivan, Clarence McKay, and Fred Krives reported up to 30 such flying objects. Their sightings (whi ch actually involved eight depu ties but not Krives) began after hearing reports of flying discs br oadcast on the police radio. The deput ies then went outside of the sheriffs headquarters to have a look for themselv es and soon caught sight of \"round\" objects flying over high and fast in a straight lin e toward the west and south. As they passed, a low humming noise could be detected. Witnesses told the International News Servi ce that \"they were there and no mistake about that.\" 13 They explained that the objects a ppeared in the s outhwest over the courthouse heading southwest at about 1,000 feet. The deputies saw numerous flights of discs—the first of which had seven objects in it. The tail end of that formation split off the main line to form a separate group rising above the others. They were described as disc-shaped with speeds approximating an aircraft. 14 To date no has been able to determine ex actly what all of these Portland and Washington State sightings represented. It should be noted, however , a flight of B-29 bombers followed by group of P- 80 jet fighters did fly over Portland just before 1:00 P.M. at high altitude. Later, Army Air Force investigators made an assumption that they may have dropped \"chaff strips of aluminum foil which were used in exercises and during wartime to jam enemy radar. This, in fact, may not be too far- fetched of an explanation as Burl Nolisch of 660 4 North Burrage Street did tell reporters that day that he saw an aircraft fly over at 1:00. He mentioned this fact only because he saw pieces of aluminum foil swirling around afte rwards—assuming they may have been dropped by the aircraft. 15 Elsewhere in the country that afternoon at 3:00 P.M. MST, 38 miles south of Great Falls, Montana, Mr. and Mrs. Curt Dennis were enjoying the holiday by fishing off a bridge. Then, as in so many other cases, they were attracted by a flash in the sky. Above them twelve silver-colored objects flew over in a Chapter Four----The Onslaught 51 single file formation headed northwest. 16 On the Sacramento River near Broderick, California, another family was enjoying a picnic when a shiny disc appeared far above. Mrs. Clarence Henn and her son, Robert, commented at the time that what ever it was, its surface must have had a highly polished finish to reflect the sun so brightly. When the object did leave, it di d not gradually move out of view, but just vanished. 17 In Pocatello, Idaho, that afternoo n R.A. Seymour observed seven high- flying star-shaped or spoked discs revolving around their own axis . They moved in steady flight,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"about four times the speed of a conventional aircraft. 18 In Richland, Washington, Mrs. Nordman saw a similar \"flying disc\" zoom northeast with a \"turning motion.\" She commented that it was only by chance that she glanced up to see it—indicating the craft emitted no noise 19 Two separate disc sighti ngs came at 6:20 P.M. EST from Charleston, South Carolina, then one from T.L. Huckaby in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, descri bing a grayish \"wash tub\" shaped object. Also in Arkansas, near Fayetteville, farmer Henry Seay had his livestock badly spooked by three low flying yellow discs. 20 In Santa Monica, Californi a, at 5:00 P.M. PST pilot Dan J. Whelan and another flyer, Duncan Underbill, witnesse d a \"flying saucer\" 40 to 50 feet in diameter \"catapulting across the sky\" at about 450 to 500 miles per hour toward the northwest on a steady course at 7,000 feet. 21 After a similar report from Mr. Nova Hart near St. Louis, one came from the Clark County Building Inspector of Las Vegas, Nevada, O.J. Morling. He stated that he and his wife saw up to two dozen \"discs\" pass over in a loose formation. They estimat ed the objects were traveling at about 100 miles per hour, at 500 feet of altitude heading toward the northeast. Private pilot Raymond Harris also saw sa ucers over Nevada. From his 150 Voyager he and a friend observed five discs below them—so bright they were hard to look at. He turned his aircraft to give chase but could not intercep t the saucers which were zipping off toward the southwest. After the incident he described the obj ects to his father, a deputy sher iff, as circular and brilliant. 22 Around twilight at 5:30 P.M. PST while near his home in the Seattle 52. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 suburb of Lake City, Coast Guardsman Yeoman Frank Ryman captured a saucer on film. Initially he spotted it at a fair distance away, flying over the north end of La ke Washington. Before taking the photo he had a chance to view the disc through binoculars and estimated it to be traveling northward at about 10,000 feet - - - somewhere around 500 mile s per hour. At least twenty other individuals watched with Ryman as he lowered his field glas ses and replaced them with a camera. His photos were developed at the local military intelligence office but showed only a sharp point of light. The military attributed the im age to a balloon, but the report, and it s supporting evidence, is claimed to have been lost. 23 (Two other independent sets of observers in other parts of Seattle reported seeing multiple discs about a half an hour before Ryman took his photos.) 24 That night an incident occurred which was second only to Arnold's sighting in terms of media coverage. Captain E.J. Smith and First Officer Ral ph Stevens of United Airlines Flight 105 were the chief witnesses. Shortly after takeoff from Bois e's Gowan Field at 9:04 P.M. MST, they observed from their DC-3 airliner five discs \"silhouetted agai nst the sunset in a loose formation.\" When Smith asked Stewardess Marty Morrow to come forward, sh e confirmed the observation. Ironically, before the crew boarded the plane, someone had asked them if they had seen any flying saucers—as the disc sightings were by then star ting to receive more and more pub licity. Smith snapped back with a smile that, \"I'll believe them when I see them.\" In that dark cockpit Smith remembered hi s famous last words as they watched the mysterious sight for several minutes as four more discs joined the group just as the original five faded from sight. The second group flew in a straight line forma tion of three together with the fourth one off by itself. Smith said \"this group seemed to be highe r than our flight path,\" [then at 7,000 feet] \"and when they did leave, they left fast!\" The sightings lasted twelve minutes a nd covered 45 miles as the unknown objects moved in a northwesterly direction across Idaho. At one point Smith recalled that it looked almost as if some of the discs merged together. Reaching a cruising altitu de of 8,000 feet, Smith had attempted to close in for a better look as the discs neared Oregon but co uld not attain an airspeed much above 185 miles"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"per hour. At that point he contacte d the nearest observer he could re ach—the radio tower at Ontario, Oregon. The attendant there could no t see anything, yet neither coul d the pilots by that point.

Intelligence people in the field who had previously been free with opinions now clammed up tight. 26 On that same night the manager of the Id aho United Press and a fiftee n-year veteran reporter, John C. Corlett, had a sighting that seemed to c onfirm the presence of something strange near Right 105. While relaxing at home in his garden, he an d his wife with their dinner guests, famed Boise artist V.H. Selby and his wife, all had a disc sighting. It occurred around th e same time as Captain Smith's encounter when the couples observed a white disc zoom across the sky in a matter of just seconds. The object came from the northwest and traveled southeast as it passed Chapter Four----The Onslaught 55 silently overhead at an altitude of about 10,000 feet in a clear sky. 27 Earlier that afternoon in Idaho, disc ac tivity had been observed near the Twin Falls area. 28 Between 2:30 P.M. MST and 3:10 P.M. three groups of discs ranging from tw enty to nine objects were seen by over sixty persons en joying the 4th of July celebrations in the local park of Twin Falls. 29 At 7:00 P.M. PST as many as 200 people observed a disc at Hauser Lake, Idaho, just a few miles northeast of Spokane. George Aster described that ev ent, stating, \"I pointed it out to the others and they all stood around and followed it for about 30 minutes while it hovered at about ten degrees above the horizon.\" The witness sa w the craft while celebrating the holiday at the lake and agreed that it must have hovered at about 20,000 feet until an aircraft came into the area and all of a sudden it shot straight up into the sky and vanished in \"a fraction of a second.\" Observers gave a host of physical descript ions ranging from a shiny aluminum disc-shaped craft to having the appearance of a s ilver dollar approximately 30 feet across. UFO researcher Dr. James McDonald tracked down George Aster in 1967 and conf irmed the details of this remarkable event. He also learned from the intervie w that while the disc had hovered, it slightly wobbled. Aster said that this behavior completely discounted in his mind the possibility the obj ect was an aircraft—due to these peculiar lateral oscillations. 30 The Independence Day Sightings may have ju st been due to mass hysteria. Although contrary to popular belief, many people who reported \"flying saucers\" on the 4th had not yet heard the term. Soon, however, the phrase would become a household word as hundreds started seeing an onslaught of flying saucers. 56. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Saturday 5 July UFOs proved even more persistent the day follo wing the Independence Day Sightings. In Augusta, Maine, at 1:15 P.M. EST dozens of reports cam e into the Civil Aeronautical Administration describing unidentifiable flying objects over the city—all heading in a northerly direction. Dan Kelly, program director at the local radio station WRDO, persona lly saw twelve of the discs. By 8:00 A.M. PST on the other side of th e country in Sacramento, California, Dr. A.K. Carr had"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"a remarkable sighting of two disc which may have been seen by others shor tly afterwards.

We could see streams of vapor behind them. The lower one continue d in an easterly direction, but the other, which I was observing through 12 power field glasses, banked sharply over the city and flew north. It seemed to stand on one edge as it turned. 31 Just 30 minutes later two si milar discs were seen far to the sout h near Dana Point, California, by Mr. and Mrs. John K. Street. Street was an insura nce company executive and he and his wife were spending the weekend at the beach side town enjoyi ng the long holiday. At the time of the incident they were sight seeing just a few miles inland at the Capistrano Missi on. Mr. and Mrs. Street described the objects they saw as two \"saucer-lik e\" craft which slowly flew up the canyon from the beach in a northerly direction toward the Capistrano Mission. 32 Then about 50 miles north northwest of Da na Point two discs were once again seen by a third independent witness over Eagle Rock, California. Dona ld Levine, ten years old at the time, described them as yellowish and traveling at a high rate of speed flying straight toward the north. 33 About that same time a fourth observer just a few miles north of Eagle Rock saw disc-like objects over Glendale, California. In that case, however, obs erver Donald Dwiggins repor ted seeing four discs which changed shape and flew at 8,000 to 9,000 feet. 34 A series of sightings occurred in Washington State around Spokane and Seattle that also involved independent observati ons of similar flying objects Chapter Four----The Onslaught 57 between 10:45 and 11:00 A.M. PST. 35 In Covington, Kentucky, that afternoon, two women described seeing a flying saucer with \"legs.\" Interestingly, that same day a Chicago woman reported an identical feature on a flying disc, stating: \"it had legs.\" 36 In Bethesda, Maryland, Jack LaBous, a visual artist, saw a very unusual flying object. He said it looked like a dome with an antenna protruding from beneath. This is of note because a Sioux Falls man described seeing an identical so rt of disc the next day — also describing some sort of pole-like appendage sticking out of the bottom of the craft. 37 Other reports on the 5th came from St. John, New Brunswick; Sherbrooke, Quebec; Port Huron, Michigan; Anaconda, Montana; Hollywood, Califor nia; Waterloo, Iowa; Akron and Cincinnati, Ohio; Portland, Oregon; South Bend and Huntington, Indiana; New Orleans, Louisiana; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Denver, Colorado; Seattle, Washington (where a \"flying football\" appeared); Wisconsin, Minnesota, Maryland, Connecticut, Utah, a nd Chicago, Illinois. 38 Of special interest, around 11:00 A.M. PST in San Jose, California, Sergeant Charles R. Sigala of the Army Air Force said he and three others observed a \"silvery\" flying disc near his home. Sigala was on leave from Hamilton Field at the time and saw the object fly by in clear view. It circled around over some nearby mountains at about 5,000 feet, dipped several times, and then headed toward the sea. Sigala estimated the object to be as large as an automobile. 39 Further north in Albany, Oregon, at 3:20 P.M. PST ex-sailor Ted Tannish and his friend Bill Lemon observed a similar circular-shaped object rapi dly flying south. They then watc hed it slow down before heading northward — finally disappearing into a cloud bank. 40 At 7:00 P.M. EST TWA pilot Captain J ohn L. Dobberteen and First Officer Frank Corwin, observed a strange looking object while over Neapo lis, Ohio. They were on a ferrying mission from"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"the East Coast with an empty airliner at about 4,000 feet when the unknown object came into sight. Both pilots described it as a \"whi rling fan blade\" about the size of a small private plane and moving at an estimated speed of 200 miles per hour. The Capt ain stated that it definitely resembled no plane or auto gyro he had ever seen and felt it may ha ve resembled a flying disc if seen from the ground. 58. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Dobberteen deviated slightly off course and followed it for a short time before correcting back to a heading for their destination in Chicago. After landing Dobberteen made a point of reporting the incident to air traffic control as the event had oc curred in commercial air lane space and he feared that the mysterious object may pose a hazard. 41 At sunset, two miles north of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Henry Seay (who had a sighting the night before) claimed he saw a ten to twelve foot wi de luminous disc briefly land on his farm! Very conservative and set in his ways, Seay described the event to UFO researcher Dr. James McDonald years later. He had been driving his cattle toward the barn for milking at the time. As he moved them up a road leading to the milking barn, a disc-like obj ect flew over him and showered down an array of sparks. The sparks landed on Seay's bare arms bu t did not burn. The whole incident, however, badly frightened his cattle. For the ne xt ten minutes Seay scurried around attempting to gather them up— being more concerned about his livestock than lo oking at the bothersome disc . Finally getting them rounded up to drive back toward the barn, he sa w the disc again. This time it had touched down between him and the barn at a distance of 200 yards across the pasture. As he gazed at the object Seay could discern a round flattene d shape that was luminous but not too blinding to look at—just too bright to clearly make out any distinct edges. Within seconds the craft silently rose up vertically to almost 40 feet and zoomed off horizontally at a speed around 50 miles an hour. As it did so, it again dropped a shower of sparks which fell to the ground but did not seem to damage his nearby oat field. Only ashes were evident from the event and Seay could not even find a mark on the ground to prove where the disc had landed. Ye t, like the night before, his cat tle remained badly spooked by the whole event. 42 We know that Alfred Lo edding was investigating such landing cases by at least 1948—the files of which have never been released by the Air Force. 43 But there is no indication Mr. Seay was ever contacted by anyone other than Dr. McDonald, a lthough Seay did say his neighbors saw the disc too. That night at 10:30 P.M. EST many Cana dian residents of Wallaceburg, Ontario, observed two large formations of luminous discs trav ersing a wide area of the nighttime sky. 44 Back east in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, Mrs. Jessie F. Willis reported that she saw eight blue flying discs heading in a northerly direction about 7:30 P.M. EST. She then observed others in groups of Chapter Four----The Onslaught 59 twos and threes. 45 By 9:30 P.M. MST Mrs. Shirley Heffer on and her sister Lois Mae Gadbaw of Butte, Montana, saw several strange craft pass overhead in a northerly direction. 46 At 10:00 P.M. MST lights were reported on the horizon by Evanston, Wyoming, residents but these may have been attributed to searchlight beams from the fairgrounds in Salt Lake City. 47 By 9:45 P.M. EST Mrs. Scott Jones, daughter, and childre n witnessed a \"shooting star\" turn and float toward the Phillips"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Packing Company in Cambridge, Maryland. It th en turned again in an opposite direction. 48 Around 10:00 or 10:30 P.M. PST in Longview, Washington, Mrs. Margaret Carter told of seeing a spherical, aluminum-colored object in the southwestern skies headed northw est.\" The object \"dipped\" several times while it was in view for up to five minutes. 49 In Norwalk, Ohio, that ni ght two Huron County farm families sa w saucers. They noted that \"one disc over-lapped the other and traveled in the opposite circular directions.\" 50 At 12:23 A.M. EST the next morning, a sighting occurred in Paterson, New Jersey. Across the country John Neisswanger of Eugene, Oregon, was returning home on a dark and lonely road about 12:30 P.M. MST. Suddenly, he became startled by a slowly-moving aerial object. His description compared it to a child's drawing of the sun with lines ar ound it. He then stopped the car, and he and his wife and another passenger watched the weird phenomenon until it passed. 51 Sunday 6 July By the end of the long three-day holiday, flying saucer incidents were stil l increasing in number. That Sunday morning began with one of the most uni que cases for the year. Following is a complete account by the witness of a remarkable UFO encounter in Omaha, Nebraska: Although I am in the greatest of hurries, being on my way to Omaha to go to the bedside of a sick relative, I must hasten to write you a few lines to describe an incident that took place only a little while ago. My boy and I have been driving steadily since we left Seattle yesterday, and came into this city only a little over an hour ago. It was just dayl ight, and as we drove down Main street, I happened to glance down one side, and saw a disc about the size of a farm wagon wheel fl oat lightly to the middle of the street, and come to a stop. Instantly I put on my brakes, but I had to back up to get 60. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 into the street where this thing lit. It stopped for only a few seconds, but I did get a good look at it, for it was only about 30 yards away, and almost still. It was not a saucer, but a disk. This was surrounded by a tube that had an enlarged opening at one end, like a funnel, and ended in a tapered point at the other. In the middle of the disk I could make out a bulge, as if a plate had been welded on the disk, and there were two narrow strips of metal running almost paralle l to each other above and below the midsection. I started to get out of the car thinking that this queer object would fall over and give a chance to examine it closer, but something was holding it up. So mething held it upright, and then the strangest thing took place. The disk was being subjected to a number of short jerks, moving forward each time a foot or two. The funnel part of the tube wa s set into the disk's rim so that the latter could roll freely, and after moving a distance of about 20 yards it rose easily and began at once to climb. I thought for that it was transparent, but no, that was due to the reflection of the lig ht. The sun was not yet up, but this shimmering effect marked the upward climb of the disk. Once it see med to stand still in midair, spinning rapidly, then it veered of [sic] to what I would say must have been northeast, and soon disappeared from view. The entire incident lasted only about forty seconds. I went over and examined the place where it had landed, but it seemed to have touched the ground so lightly that it left no mark. I am convinced beyond doubt that the disk's flight was contro lled, that it gave out signals indicating its position, and also that it is harmless. 52 About 6:00 A.M. EST that day near Miami, Florida, multiple unidentified aircraft were seen. Observers, Fred Walsh and his wife described them as \"round, silver objects wh ich were about ten to fifteen feet across.\" Those UFOs first appeared out of the Everglades and headed due south. 53 At 9:30 A.M. one disc appearing larger than an airliner flew over Tampa, Florida, headed southeast. 54 Then by 10:00 A.M. CST a similar disc was seen over Alexandria, Louisian a. In that case four people tracked the unusual aeri al object heading northwest. 55 Four discs were seen about that time"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"over New Orleans by US Army private Robert G. Hellman on leave from Camp Bliss. Hellman was on his way to his hotel room that morning when he spotted the discs high above Canal Street. He described them as flashing whirling colored saucer s, pink and silver in appearance—flying in a V formation on a steady course. 56 And around that time of day sightings of more than one disc came out of Texas. 57 Chapter Four----The Onslaught 61 Further west at 8:20 A. M. PST a veteran World War I pilot, Frank Tylman and his son, saw a disc shaped object while driving tw o miles west of Pittsburgh, California. Tylman sated that \"It was shooting toward Mount Diablo. . . It revolved in a counter-clockwise direction, as we viewed it.\" Tylman estimated the height of the object at a bout 3,000 feet and definitely moving \"faster than jet planes,\" although he did st ate that it approximated th e size of a P-80 jet. The object appeared \"circular\" and \"it ha d a definite thickness, being curved outward on both upper and lower surfaces.\" He went on explaining that unlike an aircraft, it left no smoke or vapor nor made any sound that could have been heard above the noise of his own car and the wind. The sighting lasted only 30 seconds as the disc soon disappeared into the southern horizon. 58 As that notable day went on, eight saucers were seen near a mountain in Washington State and Francis Howell claimed one \"landed\" very briefly near Tempe, Arizona. 59 The military apparently collected a file on this particular incident, but researchers found only an empty file folder when allowed to review Air Force records on UFOs in the late 1960s. By 1976 when those files had been turned over to the National Archiv es, no indication of any kind remain ed that this sighting had ever been investigated. After talking to Alfred Loedding' s son Donald, it is belie ved this may have been one of the \"landing cases\" he reme mbers his father talking about. 60 Earlier that morning at 10:00 A.M. MST well known University of Arizona football coach Niles (Mike) Casteel had reported se eing a flying disc pass over Tucson, Arizona. This same object was reported by Wallace B. Magness of the Air Materiel Command from Davis Monthan AAFB. When describing the incident to UFO researcher Ja mes McDonald in 1967, Magness characterized the object he saw as a round light—brighte r than he had ever seen before. 61 Also in Tucson the same day, a highly respected attorney, Joseph Hendron, and his wife observed three \"silver colored discs\" fly over at about 5:00 P.M. Three other Tucson w itnesses reported discs just 30 minutes before. Among them, was Walter Laos who estimated their speed at 200 miles per hour and altitude between 5,000 to 6,000 feet. 62 (Laos had an earlier sighting on June 22nd.) Arizona is also of note because on the even ing of the 6th a series of strange sightings began in Tucson describing large discs accompanied by a 62. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 group of smaller objects. These were seen to merge with, and later separate from, the larger \"parent craft.\" Amazingly, these same types of observati ons then moved clockwise around the circumference of the United States until almost the same time the following night. Cities accounting for sightings of \"companion ships\" associated with larger \"mothe r discs\" included Palmda le, California; Tacoma, Washington; Cicero, Illinois; and Manchester, Maine. 63 Jumping back into the ch ronology of July 6th, at 1:00 P.M. Paul R. Bates, a passenger on an"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"airliner ten miles southeast of Boise, Idaho, witnessed a \"flying saucer\" flas h against a mountainous background. He called a stewardess, who ran back to try to see it, but by that point the craft had disappeared to the southwest. 64 Only forty-five minutes later, at 1:45 P.M CST, an Army Air Force B-25 crew reported a similar sight during a flight from Ogden, Utah. It became one of the few incidents where a UFO was seen from above. Their plane was 100 miles west of Kans as City, Missouri, at 10,000 feet when the pilot, Archie B. Browning, caught sight of a very bright objec t. He described it as \"s haped like the top of a water tank\"—some 30 to 35 feet in diameter. Weather conditions were clear with unlimited visibility when the disc first came into view ten miles ahead and below th e left side of the B-25. The UFO may have initially been hovering because as the pilot closed to with in one or two miles, the disc began to parallel their eastward bound course and speed of 210 miles per hour. Browning turned toward the strange craft, which was climbing to 11,000 feet. Yet, just at that moment, it accelerated off at great srjeed and virtually disappeared. Although this report found its way into numerous Air Force files and was periodically commented on over the years, it di d not receive an unidentified cl assification. Today the case has a notation on it attributing the ev ent to a possible \"reflection.\" Actually many such cases were earmarked with astronomical or meteorological explanations simply because Air Force consulting astrophysicist Dr. J. Alien Hynek, hired in 1948, would make comment s to that effect on the case files he reviewed for the military. In other words, remarks of his alluding to only one possible explanation were often seized on to complete the paperwork on an open case file. It is qu ite true that in those early years Dr. Hynek did not believe that there was much to the disc sighti ngs. He, in fact, felt it coul d all be attributed to simple \"post-war nerves.\" But his rather careless examination of the early cases was not due to any intentional debunking on his part or conspiracy on the military's behalf. Unfortunately we have no real knowledge of the interaction between Hynek and Loedding. Loedding entered the picture before Hynek but Chapter Four----The Onslaught 63 obviously would have been used to brief him once the Air Force contracted for his consultations. Hynek's overall role during the early days of UFO investigations, in retrospect, seems minor. Yet it must be kept in mind that many of th ese sightings from early July were never investigated by the military—less than three to five percent. 65 There were simply too many to ever be tracked down and studied. For example, numerous sightings were reported around di fferent areas of the country that day which at best were only gleaned through newspaper accounts by Loedding and other investigators. This is regrettable because some, like the following, occurred around the same time of day. These may have been proved to be conn ected in some way if they had been investigated as a whole. The best of these sightings took place from an aircraft around 2:30 to 3:00 P.M. MST over Colorado and Kansas and is detailed by the Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Daily Enterprise: John Phillips, Jr., of Phillips Petroleum aviati on department and Henry Barbarick, company pilot, were flying at 10,000 to 12,000 fe et. \"Phillips who was piloting the plan e saw the first 'flying saucer.' He yelled to Barbarick who was reading maps, but Barbarick said the 'saucer' went by so fast that he was unable to see it. A few minutes later Phillips saw another one of the strange flying objects which he said looked like a large 'hangar door' on the hori zon but again Barbarick was unable to catch sight of it. A moment later another appeared in front of th e plane and then shot up and over the plane, and this time Barbarick caught sight of the object. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" Phillips said that at least nine of the 'saucers' [appeared] in a space of fift een minutes. Both men said the discs were flying at such a tremen dous rate of speed that they were unable to get a go od look at them. They tried unsuccessfully to clock them once when on e flashed by. Phillips turned the plane to get a better look at it, but it had disappeared by the time the plane came around. Phillips said the discs varied in size of a small plane up to a large transport. He said they looked saucer shaped with the front tilted up. He said they were definitely made of metal, since they g listened like silver in the sun. They appeared to be revolving, he said. Barbarick said that it gave you a feeling \"like someone was shooting flak at you.\" 66 Also in that area of the country at 2:45 P.M. MST a metallic disc m oving very fast was spotted over Denver, Colorado, while one appeared at the same time over south central Wyoming. 67 Fifteen minutes later and 100 miles to the 64. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 north at 3:00 P.M. MST Casper, Wyoming, resident s Mr. and Mrs. G.W. Gibson had a sighting of a single glittering disc. 68 Simultaneously, a very fast disc appeared over Santa Rosa, California. Observers Calvin McEntire and his brother Jack thought it to be the fa stest thing that they had ever seen. 69 Four other sightings of a single metallic disc took place in California around that same time in Long Beach, Mill Valley, Hamilton Field, and Fairfield-Suisun ArmyAFB. 70 The incident at the Fairfield-Suisun base involved Army Air Force Captain James H. Burniston and his wife who spotted from their back yard an object traveling three qu arters of the way across the sky in a matter of only 60 sec onds. He noted an oscillating motion to the mysterious craft as it traveled in a southeasterly direc tion at about 10,000 feet, rolling from side to side three times, with one side strongly reflecting the s un. As it rolled it became harder to see, suggesting the object was thinner in one dimension than the other. Its j size was compared to a DC-3 and because of other aircraft noises in the j vicinity, Burniston could not ascertain if the object emitted any noticeable -j sound. This case did end up in Air Force records and became considered by j investigators like Loedding to be one of the truly unexplained cas es. To this day it remains officially stamped unidentified in Air Force Files. 71 At 3:00 P.M. EST a Clearwater, Florida, woman reported \"tumbling objects that looked like pie pans traveling very high in the ai r and at a very fast rate of sp eed.\" As the discs passed over on a west to southeast course, \"trees bowed\" from a strong gust of wind assumed to be caused by their passing. 72 At 4:00 P.M. CST, twelve people in Thro ckmorton, Texas, saw a disc that produced a \"sizzling noise.\" 73 An hour and a half later in Emporia, Kansas, a silent UFO shaped like a dirigible \"floated\" low over a wheat field. This object approached three women working in the field from the south, but then veered off slowly toward the southwest. 74 Only half an hour later at 6:00 P.M. EST two shiny disc- shaped objects zoomed over Cincinnati, Ohio, traveling south to north 75 Proving to be the busiest day to date, the sa ucers' activities even made the front page of the New York Times and would do so for the next three days . UFOs also drew the attention of the military who had Army, Navy, and Chapter Four----The Onslaught 65 National Guard aircraft patrolling the Pacific co ast regions for flying discs despite what some"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"officials feared were low fuel reserves. 76 At Manhattan Beach, Califor nia, A.W. McKelvey fl ew a P-51 fighter on patr ol over Van Nuys at 35,000 feet. Five P-51s of the Oregon National Guar d cruised the Cascade Mountains and a sixth over Portland—all without success. A new P-80 jet fighter at Muroc Army Air Field and six P-51s at Portland stood ready, but no sightings occurred. 77 An Air National Guard air unit at Sioux Falls, North Dakota, had a little more excitement when a re port came in of a \"silvery disc with a short tail.\" One of its pilots on patrol that afternoon received the call to inte rcept, but he could not locate the UFO. Back in the northwest, the Oregon Guard put eight P-51s in the air and three A-26 bombers armed with telescopic cameras. General Irving O. Schaefer of Colorado's Air National Guard told reporters that he had his fighter planes on ;; standby ready to make an intercept at a moment's notice. 78 Military intelligence units also began to meaningfully enter the scene, making files on some sightings and even conducting a few low level investigations. 79 On that day the Army Air Force intelligence group under the Ai r Materiel Command in Dayton, Ohio, did feel the need to make a statement to the press, but c ould only say it had not collected any \"reputable information.\" 80 (Loedding at this early date may have not even b een consulted about the sightings.) Then, for some reason, Major General Curtis E. LeMay made a statement. LeMay had been the famed leader of the strategic bombing campaign of Japan but by then headed up research and development of all new technology at the Pentagon for the Army. He gave no real insight to military thinking on the phenomenon, simply stressing that the re ports were nothing to worry about. 81 Thus, by July 6th, it is still too early to document Alfred Loedding as being involved in any meaningful way with the disc inquiries. However that would soon change. Anyone involved with military matters that weekend would have been very curious about all the reports which continued coming in on the 6th. By evening a disc appeared over Beverly, Massachusetts. That night in Ma ssachusetts two very similar discs were seen in Wenham. 82 At 5:15 P.M. EST Patrolman Frederick Schlauch of the E lizabeth, New Jersey, police department told of seeing two \"shiny objects\" fl ying toward the northeast. 66. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 He had just finished ch anging a tire when he ca ught sight of the objects. Schlauch stated that they were very shiny and moved e rratically. Schlauch compared them to \"chrome plates\" which were \"diving in a fluttery fashion.\" He estimated the speed of the objects close to that of a fighter plane— around 400 miles per hour but stress ed they \"were not planes.\" 83 In Washington D.C. at 8:40 P.M. EST, former Army flying Cadet Hazen Kennedy glimpsed an \"orange-colored\" object flying at 1,000 to 1,500 feet moving at over 1,000 miles per hour. 84 In Rochester, New York, at 8:30 P.M. EST Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Ohley observed from their back yard a white disc \"zipping\" eastward. 85 A man in Glen Falls had a si milar sighting but noted red and blue fire-like lights on the object that he had seen. 86 In Valley Stream, New York that evening John Heathcote, fourteen years of age, saw three \"plate-like\" objects flying in a V formation toward the west. 87 The night's activities continued with a si ghting in Missouri at 6:00 P.M. CST near Mound City, when a Mr. and Mrs. Dunn and thei r children were taking a car ride with Mr. and Mrs. J.W. Hendrix and their children. The couples spotted what they described as a flying saucer about three to four miles east of Mound City. They then pulled off the road and Mrs. Hendrix noted that it had a silver hue and seemed to be of good size as it passed slow ly toward the west. But after about five minutes an aircraft came into the area from the northeast causing the saucer to suddenly change direction and"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"head off rapidly to the north. Thirty miles away in I ndustrial City Mr. and Mrs. George Painter reported seeing through field glasses an odd object traveling very quickly to the east at high alt itude. It looked li ke a shiny light from the ground, but aided by his bi noculars Mr. Painter could make out a disc surrounded by \"a dark shadow-like haze.\" Around 7:00 P.M. W.C. M iller of St. Joseph and five other persons observed a bright flying disc very high in the sky traveling in a s outhwesterly direction. They had it in sight for about two and a half minutes. Around that same time the J.E. Johnson family of the 2900 block of Jule Street reported a fl ying saucer traveling over from the northeast to the southwest. It remained in sight for about five minutes. 88 The C.D. Frank Chapter Four----The Onslaught 67 family and Ernest Smith and his wife also saw a s ilver disc while driving s outh of St. Joseph at 7:00 P.M. 89 At 7:45 P.M. Dr. Walter Hoefer, with his son and daughter, reported seeing six round oval objects flying just west of St. Louis. Mr. Hoefer stated that they silently flew south at a very high altitude. He was able to run and gr ab his binoculars before they were out of sight. With the aid of the field glasses he noted a light s pot in the center of the objects. 90 At that same time several miles away in Shrewsbury, Mr. and Mrs. George Willson and their daughter and Mr. and Mrs. Char les Downs reported seeing two gr oups of three discs zooming eastward. 91 Just to the east in St. Louis, Mrs. N. P. McDonald and her daughter Nancy and Mrs. Walter Simonds at Scanlon Avenue saw an eastwar d bound flight of six objects in two groups of three each. 92 Another St. Louis resident, Miss Lois Bogner, confirmed the same sight from Sutherland Avenue as did Leonard Coleman and his sister from anot her part of town at Pershing Avenue. 93 Finally, in Ferguson, Missouri, William A. G ood and his wife saw a disc at that same hour. 94 At 8::55 P.M. CST Staff Sergeant Ira L. Livingston in Birmingham, Alabama, reported that he and his neighbor, Herman M. Sockwell, and others noticed a round object in the western sky heading south in an arched flight path. After it passed, they observed six mo re, one at a time, traversing the same course. Livingston, who had 250 hours as a pilot and aerial gunner, estim ated that the objects were traveling 500 to 600 miles per hour at around 2,000 feet with a dim glow. The Air Force file detailing Livingston's si ghting fails to make any mention of the vast multitude of other sightings simultaneously go ing on around the city and in that whole area of the country like those from Missouri. In fact, hundr eds of other Birmingham resident s observed discs as the local radio station logged as many as 400 calls on th e strange lights between 8:00 and 9:00 P.M. 95 One Birmingham witness, Marvin Pharo, said the object s steadily increased in numbers and seemed to \"go over the mountain\" to the south. J.H. Chatham, a state mine inspector, along with his neighbors, described seeing \"egg-shaped\" fluor escent discs flying \"fairly low ag ainst the mountain\" outside of Birmingham. 68. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Other city residents like Mr. and Mrs. J.R. Martin describe d them as \"saucer-like.\" Miss Connie Murdock on 512 South 10th Court Street observed nine objects that she could only characterize as"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"\"like gobs of light moving around in the sky.\" 96 Robert Crossland of the Birmingham Age-Herald captured two photographs of the strange objects. Ar my Intelligence did analyze the photos and agreed with professional Birmi ngham photographers that it represented \"an actual image of the mysterious discs.\" 97 Others back in St. Louis, Missouri, may have had still more sightings up to 8:00 P.M. CST. 98 As late as 9:30 P.M. at least one more Missouri report came in 50 miles to the south of St. Joseph. Filed to newspapers by S.D. Wilson of Independence, he told of spotting a \"row of saucers\" flying in single file in a northerly directi on over Gardner Lake. They traveled at a high rate of speed in a straight line. Each appeared to have a bright light on their undersides. 99 Aside from the various accounts of the disc sightings, the national media via the newspapers and radio were also running storie s by the 6th on possible explana tions for the phenomena. Many theories were expressed includ ing a possible link to nuclear te sting and even a suggestion the sightings could represent physical manifestations of signals from Mars. Most scientists, however, chose to ignore the subject and those that w ould comment, suggested a connection to military testing. Two of the country's leading astronomers we re quoted by the press on that point. Dr. Gerard Kuiper, head of the University of Chicago's Ye rkes Observatory at Williams Bay, Wisconsin, and Dr. Oliver Lee, head of Northwestern University's Dearborn Observatory at Evanston, stated that the curious discs were \"man-made\" and probably \"radio -controlled.\" Lee said that \"the Army, Navy and Air Force are working secretly on all sorts of things.\" 100 Ironically, many in-the military by that date were themselves starting to w onder if some other bran ch of the service had an experimental test vehicle undergoing secret trials. Time, however , would prove no such domestic program ever existed. Although that was one theory the early inve stigators, like Alfred Loedding, had to examine. Monday 7 July Sightings were already worldwide by Monday. In England a clergyman's wife had her attention drawn skyward by \"a dark ri ng with clear-cut edges\" Chapter Four----The Onslaught 69 speeding across the sky. 101 In Mexico five discs were spotted over Mexicali and two over Ciudad Juarez. 102 Back in the United States at 2:30 AM . PST in Tacoma, Washington, two police officers saw glowing, turning, discs moving overhead on an errati c course. At first the objects would glow red, then turn purple, and work into a blue-white hue before returning to a red color. They noted one \"central saucer\" which appeared to act as a sort of \"flagship.\" Around it, smaller saucers were said to make repeated \"sorties\" to the larger disc. 103 This same type of strange phenomena was then repeated by a woman in Palmdale, California. She also described seeing a \"mother saucer\" with a \"bunch of little saucers playing around it.\" 104 At Riverside, California, an even more fantastic report came to light. There, a man stated that he saw si x discs the size of sma ll plates hovering over a power line while he was outside trying to find the cause of the static on his radio. 105 By 6:21 A.M. PST yet another case comes from Colton, Californ ia, where eight silvery \"egg or disc-shaped\" objects were observed silently flying by in a stra ight line. One of the craft was described as elliptical-shaped and \"flashing.\" 106 About two hours later a disc was sighted in Lawton, Oklahoma, headed west. Then just five minutes later near San Carlos, California, at 10:35 A.M. PST Stanley Miramon and his mother observed 30 strange objects circle overhead at about 2,000 feet. Miramo n compared them to the size"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"of an automobile and round and silvery in appearance. 107 By that afternoon n ear Glenn, California, two farmers harvesting barley noticed the sun refl ecting off three \"rows\" of discs flying overhead. They estimated that there were at least twenty-five craft flying at great spee d, moving with an up and down and side to side tipping motion. Before they passed out of sight the three row formation changed into a perfect V formation. 108 Still another sighting o ccurred near Sacramento: William Smith, a photographer for the Bee, saw a ro und object which appeared to be tumbling over and over, alternately showing a dark and a bright si de. It was unlike any plane he had seen as a former Naval aviator. He went for his camera, but when he returned it was gone. 109 Another very interesting article describes a disc sighting that morning 70. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 at the Rodgers Airport in Springfield, Missouri: A flying saucer was spotted over Springfield yesterday by three observers at the Rodgers airport, a city policeman reported last night. The officer, Frank Walker, who flies a plane in his spare time, said he took off from the Rodgers airport yesterday morning, bound on a shor t pleasure cruise toward Ozark and back. Walker said his trip was uneventful, and he di dn't sight any of the shiny discs personally, but when he returned to the airport later three fr iends who had watched his takeoff told of seeing an object \"trailing\" him for some distance. \"They said it was flat-shaped and shiny,\" Walker said, \"and that it appeared to have some sort of fins on it\" The fellow who first saw it thought I was towing a target of some kind. Altogether, three persons saw it, I believe. Walker said the men told him the object a ppeared to be rolling over stea dily. He said the observers reported that the discs followed hi m for some distance toward the nort heast and vanished as Walker's plane turned toward the southwest. 110 In Los Angeles, California, pilot Vernon Baird, while flying a war surplus P-38 fighter for the Fairchild Photogrammetric Engineers Company, told of a very cl ose aerial encounter he had with a UFO. Baird and an assistant, George Sutti n, were mapping the region between Helena and Yellowstone Park for the Reclamation Bureau. They were at 32,400 feet traveling at 360 miles per hour when a flying disc appeared 100 yards behind thei r aircraft. It had a pearl gray color and looked to be around fifteen feet in diamet er and four feet thick with a t ype of plexiglass canopy or dome on top. When the disc started to overtake the P-38, Baird took evasive action, causing it to be suddenly buffeted with strong air currents or propwash. Bair d believed the saucer may have broken up during the maneuver because after the encounter it appeared to split into two clamshell-like sections and lose altitude over the Tobacco Root Mountains of western Montana. 111 Although unheard of at the time, many UFO reports in later years would describe similar aerial separations. Often appearing as if an aircraft had broken-up in flight —rather, they seem to indicate some sort of complex change or maneuver. Inte restingly, after this sight ing made headlines, the Fairchild Company became so inundated with phone calls that a plant spokesman soon stated the incident had never really happened and was just the result of some wild talk. But it was JJ. Archer, Baird's boss, who branded it a hoax, not Baird or Suttin. 112 "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Chapter Four----The Onslaught 71 That is not an infrequent problem with UFO reports. After the fact, some witnesses, or their friends, will make a similar claim si mply to put an end to the nuisan ce of public inte rest.

Another air-to-air sighting took place that morning seven miles north of the Shreveport Municipal Airport. The Shreveport, Louisiana, Times, states: Sgt. Marvin V. Thomas, 26, of Squadron K, Barksdale Field was flying when he saw a bright silver object shaped like a saucer. Thomas said that he flew toward the object for fi ve minutes, and then veered to the right and left, trying to determine hi s distance from it but without success. It looked about the size of the moon and looked thin as it turned.\" 113 Boise Evening Statesman aviation writer Dave Johnson became keenly interested in such sightings. He was friends not only with Kenneth Arnold but came to know Captain Smith of the United Airlines Flight 105 Case too. In fact, up until 1953 when unnamed military officials suggested he tone down his enthusiasm, Johnson investigated many of the more significant UFO sightings. The following article is very revealing because it documents his first efforts to learn more about this strange phenomenon: Idaho Newsman-Pilot Given 'Dream Assignment' 'Get Picture of Saucers Or Bring One Back Alive' By DAVE JOHNSON (Idaho Statesman Aviation Editor) Boise—July 6--AP--FIew inst ruments this afternoon for a couple of hours with the Idaho national guard. A lieutenant colonel sat up in front and watched for discs while I struggled with the gauges and the radio beam. We got back into Gowen field's pattern, and the control tower called to report some people in Ontario, Ore., had told the CAA they saw some saucers wheeling through the sky. Now, there's one thing about these saucers. I've never seen one, so on the way home I dropped into the Statesman office with an idea. That was to take the Early-Bird No. 3, our airplane, and be up tonight and prowl around the airways, just looking. Gets Expense Dough I broached that to the city editor and blew the foam off of it, and a you-know-what look spread over his face, just like somebody had tossed a brick into a mud puddle. He talked for a few minutes and I listened. The upshot of it was that I walked out of the office with expense dough in my pocket and a date with Kenneth Arnold, the Boise man who two weeks ago saw the discs come roaring around Mt Rainier in Washington. 72. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 I have one of those things called a general assignment. I'm going disc hunting with Arnold in the Statesman plane. Started In Idaho The city editor had said: \"Dave, I was just about to give you a call and discuss this damn saucer business with you. The thing started here in Boise with Arnold an d it is getting out of hand. The wi re services are moving more copy on it than any single story in years except the war, and no ' one knows any more about it now than when they were doubting this fellow Arnold who first reported seeing whatever it is that is being looked at, real or imaginary.\" \"As I said before, this business started in Boise an d it is up to us if we can do it to help get it brought"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"down to earth. I hope you can lasso one of the damn things and bring it in for display, but on the other hand, it might be a good idea to be ready to duck if you see something skipping along.\" Dream Assignment I might interject here th at the boss doesn't fly. \"Crank up your airplane,\" he said, \"and go up around the Hanford atom plant area in Washington and stay there until you either find somet hing or give it up. See if this fellow Arnold wants to go along (he jumped at the chance) and take the best camera equip ment you can find and stay as long as you want to.\" Such an assignment- stay as long as you want to- is no t to be accepted lightly. \"Fly around that area,\" said the city editor, \"because my hunch is that if these things can come from any place they are coming from some project like Hanford. The army has denied this possibility but the army has been making denials a major business for years. In one case an Army man said there's nothing to get excited about, \"if there were anything to the saucers the army would have notified us.\" Also... Good Luck! If you see anything that answers the descript ion—or the hundreds of descriptions-- grab a picture and high-tail for Boise.\" \"Oh yes,\" he added. \"Good luck to you.\" They take the insurance out of my check.I phoned Arnold. We are taking off bright and early in the morning. Arnold has a new movie camera with a tele photo lens and we're fortified for pictures. From somewhere up in eastern Wa shington tomorrow night yo u'll hear from us, providing, of course, we don't run into something that proves these reports to be the McCoy and it runs over us. The city desk says he'll stand behind us.\" 114 Saucer sightings also came from S pokane, Washington; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Osburn, Idaho; Lakeview, Oregon; Rutland, Vermont; Wisc onsin; and 17 cases orig inated in Illinois. 115 Chapter Four----The Onslaught 73 A very notable incident on the 7th, fo r example, occurred around noon near Willow Springs, Illinois, when Robert Meegan and his 14 year old son John heard a buzzing noise overhead. They were working in the fields on their farm near th e Des Plains River not fa r from the Argonne National Laboratories. Looking up they saw \"13 round objects a ll going east, single file in a straight line.\" They described the objects as round with flat bottoms estimated about as big as a house and bluish- grey in color. They stated that the craft flew on a straight and level course toward the east. 116 By noontime that day Deputy Army Air For ce Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg gave up any hope of getting to regular business. His entire day proved to be dominated by phone calls on the sightings. In fact, while at Hensley Field in Dallas, Texas, that afternoon, he stated publicly that the Army Air Force was receiving thousands of queries on the disc sightings. 117 The discs reports that came out of Wisconsi n, via Boiling Field and the state's Civil Air Patrol, were even more stunning than those in Illinois an d must have attracted the General's attention. The first began at 11:45 A.M. CST when a flight instructor, Kenneth Jone s, and his student in a private aircraft at 800 feet spotted a \"saucer\" near Koshkonong, Wisconsi n. It descended from the clouds vertically and edgewise until stopping to hover at 4,000 feet. The craft then took off at a speed estimated at 6,000 miles per hour—calculated by th e 25 mile distance the object covered between Koshkonong to Elkhorn in fifteen sec onds. At the end of its speedy r un the object sudd enly stopped and hovered, then disappeared in the distance. At 2:30 P.M another set of airborne witnesses reported a saucer near East Troy, Wisconsin. Pilot Wing Supply Officer Captain R.J. Southey (Burlington Civil Air Patrol) and a passenger, Clem Hackworthy, were at 3,500 feet when they saw a flying disc below them at 2,500 feet. It then covered the 22 mile distance betw een Eagle to Muskego in twenty seconds, placing its speed at 3,960 miles per hour.

Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Another interesting EM effect befell the town of Acampo, California, the night before around dawn. Citizens of that community noted a \"spectacul ar glow in the sky\" accompanied by a loud roar just before a complete area-wide power failure. Not long after that a mysterious flying object was seen at low altitude over the nearby town of Lodi. In later years very similar UFO related blackouts have occurred, but this is one of the earliest examples of such an event. 122 One curious discovery from interviews conducted with Alfred Loedding's relatives, reveal that he was one of the first officials to recognize this importa nt facet. Other early investigator s only theorized about nuclear propulsion as a possible power plant for the discs. Loedding, for whatever reason, seemed to have a very clear understanding that many of the UFOs displayed electromagnetic properties. Around 5:20 P.M. a secretar y in the Engineering Department of Dupont's Chester, Pennsylvania, division had a more common enc ounter when witnessing five du ll gray objects fly over in a V- formation. 123 Much further south a strange encount er occurred over th e Gulf of Mexico: Captain Marian Ruffner of Midnight Pass was proceeding in her d eep sea fishing boat when she saw something that she first thought was a dirigible heading out over the Gulf. It was heading southwest, moving fast and appeared to be round and flat. It appeared and disappeared as she watched. \"It flashed in the sun and appeared to be silver in color.\" Mrs. Ruff ner described herself as \"flabbergasted\" by the sight of an object that she had previous ly taken as a joke. She reported that she was cold sober at the tirne. 124 That night at 6:30 P.M. EST a Tampa, Flor ida, man, George Gortez, a nd several others saw a V formation of three \"golden colored\" objects slowly flying overhead. 125 Further west at 8:30 P.M. CST John W. Hawkins and Virgil Ashley report ed seeing a \"flying di sc\" pass over St. Joseph, Missouri, at a high speed heading toward the north. They noticed th e craft while sitting out in the back yard of the Ashley home, one mile north of the city. The UFO appeared luminous and disc- shaped with a silver glow. Estimated to have be en around 300 feet in the air, it gave off a faint buzzing sound. Then at 9:17 P.M. a phone call came in to the St. Joseph Gazette, stating that a flying disc had just been spotted ove r the city. Reporters looked out side but did not see anything. 126 Around that same time period a single disc was seen over St. Louis, and Univ ersity City, Missouri. 127 Chapter Four----The Onslaught 77 Back east on the Atlan tic coast at 9:30 P.M. EST a \"fly ing saucer\" zoomed over Wilmington, North Carolina heading north.. Witnesses noted its hi gh rate of speed and unusual brightness with an orange tint. 128 About the same time two college kids, Albert Dugan and Charles Cross, reported seeing a large luminous object speed overhead just ten miles outside of Raleigh, North Carolina. They initially thought it to be a st ar, but then realized the object was an elliptical flying machine that radiated blue lights from its edges as it moved in a circular orbit. After about three minutes it vanished into the clouds which we re later confirmed by the Weather Bureau to be at a ceiling of 5,500 feet. An independent observation also de scribed a luminous object moving north over Asheville, North Carolina. 129 Before the day was out, Mexico City claimed several saucer sightings, reporting discs identical to those seen all over the United States. 130 Tuesday 8 July Early the next day around 7:05 A.M. CST a private pi lot viewed a very strange sight from his small"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"aircraft while over Cook Springs, Alabama. S ilhouetted against a nearby mountain, he noted a circular object with a mirror-like finish. The pilot a ttempted to close in, but its speed was so great, it soon flew out of sight. 131 At 8:15 A.M. Arizona State Highway Depart ment workers Henry Varela, R.N. Villa, and Henry Hodges observed two \"flying saucers streak high over the city of Yuma.\" Villa and Hodges saw them first and when Varela heard his friends talking he thought they must be describing aircraft. But Varela had seen an aircraft pa ss over just moments earlier and what he then witnessed looked nothing like it. All three men desc ribed the objects as saucer-shaped. They stated that they were silver in color and appeared to be just alike with one flying behind the other. The one thing that so amazed the men concerned the absolute lack of sound associated with the inci dent despite the fact the objects were at a fairly high al titude. The actual altitude could not be estimated, but all agreed the saucers were very high and traveled extremely fast in a straight line until they disappeared out of sight to the northeast. James Gor don of the US Weather Bureau sugge sted that the men could have simply made a misidentification of the planet Venus despite the fact that two distinct objects were seen in the same area of sky at the same time. 132 78. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Around 9:30 or 10:00 A.M. PST at Muroc Army Air Force Base, California, (today Edwards AFB) Lieutenant Joseph C. McHenry viewed with th ree other witnesses, two silver spherical objects traveling about 300 miles per hour in level fl ight. The unknown craft moved northward toward Mojave, California, against the prevailing wind at 8,000 feet when a third object appeared—heading in the same direction but ma king several tight circles. McHenry told intelligence officers that no ai rcraft he knew of could have performed such sharp maneuvers. Yet that was not the end of the story that day at the super secret Muroc test grounds. 133 By 11:50 A.M. at nearby Rogers Dry Lake, two technicians observed another strange event. They reported seeing a luminous round object for about 90 seconds. The men had been watching two P-82 fighters and an A-26 attack plane that were preparing for a seat ejection test when the UFO came into view. At first the men thought the object might be the parachute fr om the test, but that occurred later. The object did, however, very much resemb le a fabric-like object not quite as dense as a parachute canopy with a white aluminum color. It flew silently at a lit tle under 20,000 feet until descending at about three times the rate of the pa rachute, which was visible during the ejection test. As it came lower its silhouette presented a distinctive oval shape with two projections on the upper surface which seemed to slowly oscillate. The UFO moved against the wind in a northwesterly direction toward Mount Wilson until it was lost from sight as it des cended level with the tops of a nearby mountain range. 134 Still later at 3:50 P.M., 40 miles south of Muroc, a P-51 pilot at 20,000 feet spotted a wingless, tailless \"flat object of light-reflecting nature.\" He twice attempted an intercept but could not climb high enough. Intelligence later took great note of th at incident because they determined that no military or civilian aircraft were in the area. 135 That night at 9:20 P.M. spherical objects were again seen in the area, this time at 8,000 feet still moving against the wind at around 300 miles per hour. This was reminiscent of a sighting just the day before at 10:10 A.M. when Muroc test pilot Ma jor J.C. Wise, while preparing his XP-84 aircraft for takeoff, observed one yellowish-white spherical object traveling at 200 to 225 miles per hour at 10,000 feet. It headed east w ith an oscillating motion. 136 These disc sightings over Muroc really shook-up the Pentagon. Known collectively as the Muroc Sightings, the incidents led the Army Air Force to issue classified orders requiring reports of any"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"\"saucer-like\" objects to be Chapter Four----The Onslaught 79 given to the T-2 branch (the T echnical Intelligence office—redesi gnated the Technical Intelligence Division or TID in August) of th e Air Materiel Command at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio. A post- war version of the highly secret T-2 wartime in telligence group, the Techni cal Intelligence (later Division) specialized in colle cting data on enemy aircraft. T-2 at the Air Materiel Command had been \" unofficially interested\" in the disc reports which had filtered in via the Pentagon and various Air Force commands—namely the Fourth Air Force. 137 In fact, beginning with the July 4th Independence Da y Sightings a directive came down from Army Air Force Chief of Staff General Carl Spaatz who wanted the 4th AAF Intelligence at Hamilton Field to \"open a file,\" although he specified that they should then report their findings to the Air Materiel Command. Yet the Muroc incidents threw matters into high gear and motivated the Pentagon to ask for a maximum effort from intelligence units aro und the world. Orders were then sent to all US Army air bases requiring sightings near their area to be investigat ed and reports sent directly to Wright Field with paperwork also going to the Pe ntagon. Actually, research shows that most of the early casework went directly to the Pentagon, and Wright Field did not get a complete set of files until September of 1947—by which time Loedding was working in a meaningful way with the investigations and persona lly lobbying for the reports. By July 8th investigators from Wright Fi eld, along with Alfred Loedding, began to speculate the flying disc phenomenon may be advanced German Third Reich weapons and/or aircraft being designed and flown over the United States by the Sovi et Union's military forces. Specifically suspect were the wartime designs of flyi ng-wing style aircraft inspired by the Horten brothers, Reimar and Walter of-Goettingen. One of thei r jet propelled flying wing designs had made its way to Wright Labs after the war and was undoubtedly st udied by Loedding and the T-2 office. Shortly after July 8th Technical Intelligence at Wright Field requested that the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps-Europe, or ECIC , help in the investigation. 138 Their agents in Germany scoured the allied occupation zones for clues to the existence of any models of Horten-like ai rcraft but found nothing. 139 Thus, without doubt, the government already be gan feeling pressure to solve the saucer mystery as early as July 8th. Although, it is unkn own just how much reactive concern the Truman administration placed on the Pentagon and subsequen tly to Intelligence. Yet, between July 8th and 80. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 July 9th, the wheels began turning very fast. Washington released the following statement: Washington, July 9 (UP)—Official Wa shington was sure today that it knew what the flying saucers were not-but it hadn't the faintest idea what they were. The Army Air Forces said they had the matter under investigation. Preliminary study has di sclosed that the flying discs are not: 1. Secret bacteriological weapon s designed by some foreign 2. New-type Army rockets. 3. Spaceships. 140"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" In reaction, Army Air Force Requirements In telligence branch chief, Brigadier General George F. Schulgen, called on the FBI to give additional assistance. Schulgen also brought in one of the Muroc pilots to the Pentagon to be interrogate d by a host of generals, scientists, and even psychologists. Despite a thorough grilling, the pilot re mained convinced that he had seen a \"flying disk.\" 141 (See Appendix II.) Schulgen also worked on the flying disc phenomenon with Pentagon In telligence Collections branch executive Colonel Robert Taylor and his right-hand man, Lieutenant Colonel George D. Garrett. It was Garrett and the Collection branch that Loedding would coordina te with in his liaison work. But, documents do show Loedding had meetings in person with Schulgen as well. Taylor and Garrett were also the military connection to the FB I. They utilized FBI Sp ecial Agent S.W. Reynolds for the first inquiries into the by-then nation-wide rash of disc sightings. In late July, Colonel Garrett, perhaps af ter networking with Loeddi ng, decided to write up a report and send it to both the FB I and the upper echelons of the Pentagon. His memo basically served as a preliminary estimate of the current UFO situation. The intention in compiling the paper may have also been to bring the issue to a head. In other words, this report hoped to establish a position on the phenomenon. Garrett, and certainly Loedding, first of all want ed to know if the discs represented a secret American project. (See Appendix III.) After that their more ove rwhelming fears centered around something of foreign—namely Soviet origin. All of these men, however, quickly became frustrated with the higher echelons of the military in their attempts to crack the myst ery. Distinguished UFO researcher Professor Michael Swords writes in reference to this: Chapter Four----The Onslaught 81 As July wore on into August, Garre tt, Schulgen, and Reynolds became confused by a void of interest or pressure emanating from the high echelons of the Pentagon. They had gone through an investigative furor, which they considered to be similar to the flyi ng disks, the previous year when hundreds of \"ghost rocket\" reports were made in Sweden and other Europe an countries. In the 1946 experience, though, the top brass had exerted continuous p ressure to find an answer. But h ere, the brass had gone completely quiet. This puzzling void has been termed \"the Silence from Topside.\" It was very peculiar to Garrett and the FBI. Their mutual suspicion was that the very highest brass knew what this phenomenon was already. 142 The Silence from Topside refers to a connection to the Roswell Incide nt. Some researchers feel that physical evidence was recovered during that even t, proving the flying di scs to represent a real technology. The assumption is of course that the \"tec hnology\" was of extraterrest rial origin and that the \"top brass\" were involved in a cover up of evidence. Others feel th at if there was a suspicion that the high brass \"knew the real answ er,\" it involved the idea of a secret insight into captured Nazi technology. The FBI simply wanted to know up front if the phenomenon was something that actually required their expertise as the Bu reau's manpower was limited. In othe r words, as Loren Gross wrote in his book on the 1947 wave: \"If the saucers were not due to Communist agents making false reports, there wasn't much to keep the FBI busy.\" 143 (See Appendix IV for example of FBI memos expressing concern.) Yet, the military was truly con cerned about a Soviet link. Even as late as 1952, some Pentagon officials would be speculating ab out a German/Soviet connection to the disc mystery. Following is an intriguing letter which came into Air Force Intelligence in 1952. It would seem to support such an assertion if it is indeed a genuine account:"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Rudolf Goy Menehek-Power P.O. Box 2000 Mont Joli, P.

All this noise about these flying apparatus is known to you, but I would like to tell you no t to believe in the visits from other planets or in the meteorological phenomena, because I believe that all this is a big mistake. In 1944 I worked with a small group of scientists and technicians on flying apparatus which resembled exactly this \"Flying Saucer.\" Due to the air raids our group was sent to S ilesia in order to work undisturbed. The experiments were only model tests and they were supposed to be realized in great haste since, according to Teich Marshal Goring's directive, this was Hitler's \"Mystery We apon.\" We were subordinate directly to him (Goring) and cut off from every outsid e communication. Even the letters which I wrote to my wife had to be addressed via Berlin where they were subject to censorship. The end ca me in 1945. We wanted to save at least something, so we separated and tried to reach the west individually. As I found out, not everyone succeeded because three of our group were captu red and with them a part of the test results as well as some technical drawings. This was reported to me by a colleague who succeeded in escaping at the last moment. This is what I have to say on this poin t. Now, let's go to the apparatus itself. After the wind- tunnel tests, an experimental model was built of 3.6 m (in diameter). The driving motor was the same as \" the one used for the experimental ro ckets. The steering gear was remote ly controlled and similar to the FX-Bombs, which I know you are familiar with. From the aerotechnical stan dpoint, the results were amazing and they surpassed all expectations. However, it would take too long to give you all the details. You have a staff of scientists and technicians and I can only advise you to work a full steam so that the technique will not be 10 years ahead in a certain part of the wo rld, while you believe yourselves to be in the first place. I am thinking of the jets in Korea. Bu t please, do not think that I, as a small man, would like to propose something. I don't. But do not be misled about things which do exist. Perhaps you will say: \"Who does he think he is, this German guy, he can't teach us, Americans, etc. .. .\" Please, gentlemen, the question now is not \"who invented this thing,\" the only thing that matters now is not to be the last one and, at a decisive moment, find oneself confronted with the facts. By then , of course, it would be too late. Just look at 1939-1945, and I believe we learned enou gh. I hope that you do not misunderstand me. Even though my duty is not to gossip about these things, nevertheless, the existence of these things released me from the secrecy-oath given at that time to the constructor. I wish you every success in this work and I remain Sincerely, Rudolf Goy P.S. I am reported the same to the Vice-Chief of Staff of the Royal Canadian Air Force. 144 Chapter Four----The Onslaught 83 In late July Colonel Garrett finished his preliminary estimate of the current UFO situation:"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"From detailed study of reports select ed for their impression of veracity and reliability, several conclusions have been formed: (a) This \"flying saucer\" situation is not all imagin ary or seeing too much in some natural phenomenon. Something is really flying around. (b) Lack of topside inquiries, when compared to the prompt and demanding inquires that have originated topside upon former events, give more ordinary weight to the possibility that this is a domestic project, about which the President, etc. know. (c) Whatever the objects are, this much ca n be said of their physical appearance: 1. The surface of these objects is meta llic, indicating a metallic skin, at least. 2. When a trail is observed, it is lightly colored, a Bl ue-Brown haze, that is similar to a rocket engine's exhaust. Contrary to a rocket of the solid type, one observation indicates that the fuel may be throttled which would indicate a liquid rocket engine. 3. As to shape, all observations stat e that the object is circular or at least elliptical, flat on the bottom and slightly domed on the top. The size estimates place it somewhere near the size of a C-54 or a Constellation. 4. Some reports described two tabs, located at the rear and symmetrical about th e axis of flight motion. 5. Flights have been reported, from three to nine of them, flying good fo rmation on each other, with speeds always above 300 knots. 6. The discs oscillate laterally while flying along, which could be snaking. 145 The report did force the Pentagon to star t eliminating possibilities. The Chief of Research and Development, General Curtis E. LeMay, dispelled the first assumption. He st ated, that \"the Army Air Force has no project with the ch aracteristics similar to those which have been associated with the Flying Discs.\" 146 Nevertheless, something from somewhere was definitely flying over US air space that July. The people con cerned, like Loedding, had but one other possibility to eliminate—a Soviet connection. On that watershed day of the 8th of Ju ly, UFO activity proved active elsewhere in the country. At 1:00 P.M. PST in Avalon, California, several hundred witnesses on Santa Catalina Island off Long Beach observed a formation of \"saucers.\" Most observers agreed that there were six disc- shaped objects in the formation which passed over the island. Among those were Army Air Corps veterans Bob Jung, Kenneth Johnson, and Alvio Russo. Jung 84. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 actually got a photo of th e objects as did Alvio Russo. Russo, who had piloted 35 combat missions over Europe, estimated their speed at 850 miles per hour. Jung clarified the details by stating that they were flying in two elements of three each about as fast as a Navy Tiny Tim rocket. He said the formation came in from the northeast and disappe ared over the hills to the south of AvalonBay. 147 By 3:30 P.M. PST in Seattle, Washington, a \"very shiny\" oval-shaped disc with a \"glass dome on top\" flew in a northwest direction over the city. 148 In St. Joseph, Missouri, at 4:20 P.M. CST Mrs. La Verla McCord and neighbor Mrs. Frances Illines reported a white luminous round object traveling slowly to the northeast. The craft seemed to be high, but the women were surprised that it made no noise. Many tried to convince them that they had seen a balloon desp ite the fact that the wind at that time was from the east. Weather Bu reau observer Arthur Van Cleave confirmed this although admitted winds above 8,000 feet were from the northwest, but did not think they could have been capable of blowing a balloon northeast. Th en, just as the excitement over the first sighting died down, another disc report cam e at 6:00 P.M. from St. Joseph. 149 One of the most credible accounts of the ear ly sightings came out of an incident over Alton, New Hampshire, at 4:26 P.M. EST. The report was made by private pilot Thomas Dale, the son of noted Governor Charles M. Dale and a highly respected pilot during WWII. For th at reason the press took great interest in his st ory and undoubtedly accounts of the inci dent were monitored by Loedding and"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"others in Dayton as well as th e Pentagon. Furthermore, Dale was not alone at the time. His friend Jere Stetson was in the aircraft with him and both told an identical account. They stated that while flying southwest ove r Alton at an altitude of 2,800 feet, a strange object appeared two miles to the east a nd some 1,500 feet below their plane. It then approached them at \"excessive speed\" in a matter of 15 to 18 second s as it veered north over Alton Bay and Lake Winnipesaukee, toward Moultenboro. Both men were careful not to assume anything. Dale, in fact, stated that \"I'm not saying it was a 'flying saucer,' or disc.\" But the men di d agree that it did not \"in any way, shape or manner\" resemble any type of know n aircraft. They then went on to stress that it was definitely of metal constr uction, about 20 feet long, and \"not exactly round in shape.\" When they first spotted the object it was observed in profile against the trees below. They said the sight left them \"flabbergasted.\" 150 Chapter Four----The Onslaught 85 That evening numerous sightings came fr om Philadelphia and southern New Jersey. Although only a few reports were printed by area newspape rs, hundreds of witnesses in the city and area suburbs saw a huge flying cone-sha ped object that was colored gray. 151 Researchers, however, are always hesitant when reading accounts of cone shaped objects simply because that is a prime characteristic of the large research balloons—j ust starting to come into use at that time. Around 9:50 P.M. PST a huge formation of lu minous \"flying saucers\" were spotted over Fraser Valley, British Columbia, heading west at great speed. 152 Finally at 11:05 P.M. PST, UFOs appeared over Chino, California which topped a list of dozens of sightings in the state that day which involved hundreds of witnesses. 153 Other headlines from the 8th came from all over North America, but exact times for the sightings are hard to pin down. Saucer reports, for exampl e, came from parts of Ohio, but no times were recorded. 154 Similarly, a very good sighting came from Co rapeak, North Carolina, that day. Many valuable details were provided by a news article—all but the time of sighting: A Farmer saw an object shaped like an enormous pa ncake, something like a fl ounder with its tail cut off. It appeared to be about 20-30 feet in diameter and moving about 800 miles per hour at about 2,000 feet. The object had two window-shap ed openings. The body seemed to be of stainless steel or aluminum with a glow. The witness heard an al most inaudible sound as the object passed out of his sight in three or four seconds. It had several protruding pipe-shaped extensions which emitted vapor. 155 A report from Norfolk, Virginia, places other strange aerial phenomena over the East Coast: Lt. Cmdr. L.D. Patterson of the Naval Station reported five yellowish discs like the moon, flying in formation over the Air Station from the West. Patterson said the formation was surrounded by a mist, and the bodies each left trails. Walter Hurst who telephon ed the Ledger-Dispatch for Patterson , said that Patterson, a pilot of considerable time in the air, was un able to establish the altitude having no point for calculation. 156 86. Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Even far distant American bases experien ced UFO incidents during the summer wave. It was on the 8th at 5:33 P.M. HST that one hundred Navy men at Pearl Harbor witnessed a mysterious"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"\"silvery colored\" object with no wings or tail sail over Honol ulu at rapid speed in a zig-zagging flight heading east. Five of the observers familiar with weather balloons commented that it just could not have been any type of balloon. Yeoman 1st Class Douglas Kahcerle of New Bedford, Massachusetts, stated: \"It moved extremely fast for a short peri od, seemed to slow down, then disappeared high in the air.\" 157 On the other side of the world in Austra lia, \"flying saucers\" were reported over Sydney on the 7th and 8th. The sightings occurred at night over the suburb of Kensington when two \"white shiny discs\" traveled quickly to the west toward Parramatta at about 10,000 feet. \"Flying saucers\" moving in a V formation were also reported ov er South Africa by Johannesburg residents. 158 1.

In his book on the 1947 wave, Bloecher tells of another sighting of a V formation of discs in Auburn, California, just an hour earlier to the Twin Fa lls case. Bloecher wrote: \"Kje ll Qvale, an automobile salesman in Alameda and a former Navy pilot for five years, reported that he and a group of 50 other witnesses had watched a triangular formation of disc- like objects near Auburn at 2:30 P.M. PST, flying south. Qvale said that the discs, seen firs t directly overhead, 'appeared to be made of metal and looked like bright silver,' He added that their round outline was clearly distinguishable. The objects were in view 'for three or four minutes,' he said. 'I have seen a lot of airplanes, and these were not airplanes. The only clue I could get as to their height, size and speed was the fact that they disappeared one at a time, high in the sky, and not over the horizon. This effect would be caused if they were very, very large and very high, and flying at a terrific"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"speed—1,000 miles an hour,' he said.\" Bloecher also sites a sighting of a V formation of discs that night in Denver, Colorado as well as two sightings of similar V formations over New Orleans on July 6th. 29.

Chapter Five A Very Serious Business The Muroc Sightings were the pivotal event which activated the United States military into concerted action on the saucer mystery. After that point, as Edward Ruppelt recalls, it was indeed a very serious business. In the middle of this was poised Alfred Loedding. Dayton started to receive firsthand UF O reports by Wednesday, July 9th. One of these came"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"from Idaho when Boise Evening Statesman writer Dave Johnson, who after three days of trying, finally caught a glimpse of a UFO. Flying out of Go wan Field in an AT-6 from his National Guard unit, he observed at 12:17 P.M. MST a strange looking dark object. Johnson tried to make sense of the weird sight as it became silhouetted agai nst the clouds. The UFO then made a half-roll and entered a stair-step climb. Johnson at first t hought it might be a balloon. (Many of the early meteorological balloons were made from neoprene which would turn smoky gray or black in the sunlight.) 1 No apparent balloon launches, howev er, could account for the incident. 2 Later, Johnson learned that three ground observe rs at Gowan Field who were National Guard pilots had also reported a similar object. 3 Like Johnson, they too were mystified as to what it was they had seen that day. Another sighting came in from the 1380th Army Air Force Base in Fort Pepperell, Newfoundland. It related a story near Grand Falls, when a police cons table's wife and mother-in-law observed four \"egg-shaped phosphorus colored discs. \" Each disc passed ove r in a side-by-side formation around 11:30 P.M. ADT. Ten minutes late r a similar object, which the constable saw himself, darted across the sky with a \"jellyfish-like flash.\" 4 A report that never reached Dayton, but is of interest came from two men flying over Glacier Park, Montana, at 3:53 P.M. MST. They spotted seven flying saucers heading in a northwesterly direction. The two men, Ed Johnson and Joe Dimio, not ed that the craft were only visible for a short period—indicating they traveled at a fairly fast rate. 5 88 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Less than three to five percent of UFO incidents were reported to Air Force Intelligence. 6 For example, another very good sighting that was only documented by the newspapers came at 5:45 P.M. CST from the nationally known News-Press editor, Helen Culver Gettys. She witnessed a flying saucer pass over her car near the St. Joseph (M issouri) Country Club. Mrs. Gettys had just left the club with her mother and Mrs. Charles Culver wh en a flash in the sky caught her eye. All of the ladies were then quite startled to look up and see one of the famous saucers. As it flew northward at about 1,000 feet, they commented on how the sun re flected off its shiny metal surface. The disc appeared in full view for a matter of seconds, indicat ing it traversed the area at a high rate of speed. All three women possessed solid reputations and Mrs. Gettys stressed in he r own article about the incident that prior to the sighting they had consum ed only \"one bottle apiece of a local bottler's very soft drink.\" 7 At 8:00 P.M. CST a Liano, Texas, man, T. A. Smith, reported a disc going southeast. Smith described it as a whirling wash tub throwing off sparks. 8 Finally, that night a West Virginia man decided to do something about the unsettling wave of saucer sightings. When discs appeared over Johnny Johnson's Bluefield home, he fired upon them with his shotgun! The irate West Virginian failed to do any visible damage to the saucers. But if this account is accurate , the UFOs in this case had to have been flying at a very low a ltitude in order to come into gun range. 9 Thursday 10 July Saucer sightings were reported by newspapers on the following morning from Ontario, Canada; Westminster, Colorado; Douglas, Arizona; Burien and Seattle, Washington; and Niwot and Aurora, Colorado. 10 That afternoon George Dey and Roy Wilson re ported to newsmen that they had seen at 1:20 P.M. MST, seven \"flying saucers\" over the Joel Hart ranch west of B uhl, Idaho. They said at first the objects were shiny and flying in formati on, but then they broke up and sped out of sight. 11"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"At 4:30 P.M. EST a Logan, West Virginia, man, George Vance, observed a \"round-shaped object with a sort of a turtle back\" glistening intensely as it flew in a straight line. 12 Chapter Five----A Very Serious Business 89 As the sightings continued one of the top US astronomers from the Department of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico, Dr . Lincoln La Paz, his wife, and two teenaged daughters, reported seeing an elliptical object ve ry high among the clouds. The incident occurred at 4:47 P.M. MST while they were driving from Clovi s to Clines Corner, New Mexico. La Paz estimated, with the aid of a pencil held at arm's length, that the object was 20 to 30 miles from his position, ellipsoidal and rigid, 160 feet long and 65 feet thick, traveling 120 to 180 miles per hour horizontally and 600 to 900 m iles per hour vertically. It appe ared silent and \"self-luminous\" against the dark clouds with a so rt of \"wobbling motion\" and no e xhaust or vapor trail could be observed. The object had \"a sharp and firm regular outline, namely one of a smooth elliptical character much harder and sharper th an the edges of the clouds.\" It re mained in view for at least 30 seconds and \" then ascended upward and disapp eared for five seconds behind a cloud until it **\"' reappeared at a two degree elevati on and about a five degree elevati on north of true west. Finally, it vanished into the clouds for good. La Paz stated that , the ascent he saw the object make \"thoroughly convinced me that we were ^ dealing with an absolutely novel airborne device.\" 13 There is a possibility this sighting could have represented a balloon. Large polyethylene envelopes were just then coming into use for re search balloons and could easily reflect the sun's rays, yet would never travel that fa st if his calculations were correct. 14 Despite this, interest in the sighting continued for many years. The case was first made public by Life magazine in 1952 but withheld La Paz's name. The sighting was examin ed by the Air Force and a file compiled, but all evidence of the paperwork was removed before releas e of UFO files to the National Archive's in late 1975. Today the case is not even listed in the Blue Book Index which is now also a part of the National Archives' collection. More sightings came from the West that day. In Cheyenne, Wyoming, two silver discs shaped like saucers with a dome on top slow ly passed over in a clear sky. 15 In Temple, Texas, a former Army Air Corps colonel, Smith Tarrant, observe d two flying \"discs\" from the door of a local welding shop. He estimated they were at 1,500 feet , flying against the wind, heading along a straight course at about 200 to 250 miles per hour. They head ed out of sight over the course of three minutes to the south with no indication of so und or smoke or means of propulsion. 16 That same day numerous individuals obser ved discs fly through the skies of Missouri, although few of these sightings sound like balloons either. 90 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 It all began with 60 eyewitnesses at an ice cream social on the John Cox farm six miles northeast of Mercer. They witnessed groups of saucers in twos and threes pass over north to south. Some did fly by themselves, but most were in formation. A mile south of Princeton, Missouri, (fourteen miles south of Me rcer) those same flights of discs were observed by Mr. and Mrs. Dykes and Mr. and Mrs. J.W. Buren and their families while driving down US Highway 65. The sight so startled them that they pulled off the road only to be joined by"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"other motorists. Among those were Mr. and Mrs. W.S. Thompson with their friend, J.M. Beets. Other observers included Mr. and Mrs. Rit Thom pson and Mr. and Mrs. W.H. Nell. All gave a similar account to the one that happened at th e Cox farm, stating that the saucers came over singularly and in groups for almost a half hour. In fact, on a farm one mile east of Princeton, Mr. and Mrs. Parvin Woodward and thei r guest, Perry Coon, confirmed this same \"saucer show.\" 17 At 7:00 P.M. MST near Brockton, Montana, Ray Carpenter and his wife observed a shiny object illuminated against a dark cloud bank. A former manage r of the Wolf Point airport, Carpenter judged it to be about the same size as a private aircraft traveling very quickly. 18 Then at 8:00 P.M. a pilot for the Lee Geophysical Company, saw a shiny craf t zooming southward near Tulsa, Oklahoma. 19 At that same time another Tulsa man, J.C. Penm an, reported seeing a \"circular fluorescent lamp\" move in a northeasterly di rection. Penman was a former Army Air Force crew chief and had never seen anything like it before. 20 A half hour later one more disc appeared over a mountainous area northeast of Salt Lake City, Utah. Described as an \"a luminum type of thing,\" it remained in view for two minutes as it moved with a fast but \"funny\" motion. 21 Then in Indianapolis, Indiana, Mrs. Bernie Hollingsworth had a sighti ng at 9:30 P.M. CST. She describe d a \"flying saucer\" pass near her home headed east, stating that it l ooked like a \"shining piece of oblong steel.\" 22 By 11:55 P.M. EST a flying saucer was seen southeast of Dover, De laware. Mrs. Hilda Dinsmore characterized the object she saw as a round dull colo red object \"sailing across the sky.\" 23 Another report came from Newfoundla nd on the 10th from two Pan-American Airways mechanics near Harmon Field, AAFB, Stephenville Cr oss. At 5:30 P.M. ADT they (and a third man) were driving up a mountain road six Chapter Five----A Very Serious Business 91 miles south-southwest of the base when all three of them, J.N. Mehrman, A.R. Leidy, and I.E. Woodruff, observed a silver circul ar disc at about 10,000 feet. It pa ssed in horizontal flight along a great curved course. The disc's size, they stated, approximated the wingspan of a C-54 transport aircraft and looked to be cutting a bluish-black tr ail about fifteen miles long as it literally parted a path through the clouds over Harmon. The trail passed over the base and out toward the north-northeast —being compared to the afterglow of a powerful searchlight when sudde nly switched off. Weat her records confirmed scattered clouds between 8,000 to 10,000 feet whic h supported the original altitude estimate. "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" Some personnel of the 1388th at Harm on Field also s aw this gr eat cut m ade i n the clouds and acquired tw o Kodachr ome pictures taken by one of the mechanics who first witne ssed the e vent.

The sighting bec ame esp ecially relev ant to Inte llig ence of ficials both at Wright Field and the Pentagon because of the concer n of a Soviet connection to the saucer m ystery. The reasoning basically followed the assum ption th at if the USSR was f lying spy flights over the United States, the m issions would logically have to pass 92 Alfred Loeddi ng an d Th e G reat Fl ying Sauce r Wave of 1947 over som e area of Canada or the far north. For that reason the sighting just twelve hours earlier in Newfoundla nd coupled with this one, and a disc report out of Alaska the very next day, stirred up a lot of excitem ent. 25 The initial report was filed by base inte lligence officers on the 16th, but by the 21st a m ore detailed report was forwarded to the Pentagon. General Schulgen then ordered intelligence at W right Field in Dayton to send a top-level assessm ent tea m to Harm on Field \" imm ediately.\" 26 The T-2 chief, Colonel Howard M. McCoy, dispatched a team by the 30th that may have included T -3 (engineer section) specialist Alfred Loedding. Mc Coy' s team was also asked by Schulgen to report directly to the Pentagon follow ing their investigation. Intere stingly, at that tim e, Schulgen also asked McCoy what the T-2 analysis and the T-3 engineering sections had \"prepared\" to date on the disc phenom enon. Mc Coy' s notes do not tell us if Analysis Division Chief Colonel William R. Clingerm an had any ans wers or if th e T-3 sec tio n at W right Labs had co mpiled any analysis. McCoy hi mself was working on the Germ an/Soviet technology angle. He, in fact, had even interviewed the fam ous s uccessor to Count Zeppelin 's dirigible em pire, Hugo Eckener. Eckener w as then in Am erica consulting with th e Goodyear com pany to try to revive the era of the great airships"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"following WWII. 27 The T-2 investigation of the Harmon Field Case really shook up their own aeronautical engineers in the T-3 section. Part of the re port had the ring of Alfred Loedding's expertise and read as follows: The bluish-black trail seems to indicate ordinary co mbustion from a turbo-jet engine, athodyd motor, or some combination of these types of power plants. The absence of noise and apparent dissolving of the clouds to form a clear path indicate s a relatively large mass flow of a rectangular cross section containing a considerable amount of heat. 28 The T-2 team excluded a meteor or fireball sc enario in their own minds despite the fact that an astronomical event became the official conclusi on on the case file. Behind the scenes, T-2 and Washington were still focused on a Soviet connec tion. Wright Field investigators spoke with the commander of Harmon Field and others to make sure that no British or Canadian aircraft had been in the area at the time. And since they knew no Ameri can aircraft were to blame, they privately concluded something of \"foreign origin\" made th at curious split in the clouds over Newfoundland. Chapter Five----A Very Serious Business 93 Although, by 1948, \"foreign origin\" would become a catch word in Dayton to refer to extraterrestrial space craft, these men where only ta lking about a Russian threat at that time. Their concern grew, In fact, because Newfoundland seemed to be especially attractiv e to the discs. Early the next morning at 2:20 A.M. Codroy residents reported seeing a \"flying saucer\" with a cone- shaped tail. Two men saw the object when they we re standing outside a lo cal store and had their attention drawn to the sky by a very bright disc streaki ng across with a yellowish cone-shaped after- glow. They described it as a luminous object traveling at great speed from the northwest and heading east at about 6,000 feet. 29 Both men felt certain they could not have mistaken it for a plane or falling star. A third man then saw the same aerial phenomenon. He had served in the civilian Air Detection Corps during the war a nd possessed great experience with identifying aircraft. He also became convinced the disc was \"not a plane, bu t definitely some flying object.\"30 Overseas in Norway, European papers were talking about \"flying saucers\":  A \"flying saucer\" was observed Thursday evening near Skotfoss. At about 19:30 my wife told me that she had seen an object in the sky, says one of the three persons who observ ed \"the saucer.\" It moved in between the clouds at an undete rmined altitude, blinking like a star or like a mirror when the sun is reflected in it. As it entered the shadow it became dark and round or oval. It is completely out of the question that it was an airplane. There was no sound from the saucer, which was about the size of an airplane. The object was in view for four minutes and then disappeared towards the southeast. 31 Before the day was out discs were al so seen in Amsterdam, and Leyden, Netherlands; Birmingham, England; Santiago, Chile; Kagoshima Bay, Japan; and then back in North America over New York, California, and Ripley, Ontario. 32 Friday 11 July UFO activity started early in the morning of the llth at 2:30 A.M. MST when Mrs. Anna Potts of Yuma, Arizona, rose from bed frustrated by her barking dog. She got up and went outside to quiet him when suddenly, and to her great amazement, she saw a disc-shaped object go over at high speed with a spinning or rotating motion. The cr aft passed without a sound in a matter of"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 94 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 just five seconds. This suggested that the craft must have been at a relatively low altitude as it became lost from view after crossing the tops of nearby homes. Mrs. Potts reported the event to the Daily Sun, absolutely convinced she had seen a flying saucer. 33 Perhaps the same object flashed in front of Mr. Ernest Tiffany's bedroom wi ndow one hour later in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 34 In Longview, Washington, at 6:30 P.M. PST two groups of a dozen or more shiny objects were observed flying with bright flashes as th ey turned and caught the sun's reflection. 35 By 7:20 P.M. EST a report came out of High Point, North Carolina, when pilots flying at 1,000 feet saw a \"ball of fire.\" It appeared as a huge object, round on top with a black ba nd through the cente r. \"The bottom part of the object was revolving, and periodically bursts of fire came from underneath, as if some sort of exhaust.\" 36 Later that day around 10:00 A.M. GMT while ferrying a Viking transport aircraft to Argentina, Captain Norman E. Waugh of L ondon's Airwork Ltd. had a very in teresting UFO sighting over the Bay of Biscay. Waugh was near 8,000 feet when he spotted ahead, and above him, an elongated oval or \"tadpole\" shaped craft flying at about 16,000 feet. First Officer Peter Roberts and Radio Officer Stuart Chinneck both agreed with Captain Waugh that the object looked grayish in color and of unusual design. At one point they came within five to six miles of the UFO. It then passed the starboard side of their aircraft at lightning sp eed, leaving a long vapor tr ail. During that time the flight crew estimated the object to be traveling about 600 miles per hour at 7,000 feet above their aircraft. Waugh, a former Bomber Command and Trans port Command pilot with sixteen years flying experience, and Roberts, a former wartime Squadron Leader, knew no aircraft outside the US proving grounds at Muroc had that kind of performance. They later told reporters that neither of them had seen anything like it before. 37 On that same side of the world during a small country fair, a \"flying saucer\" appeared over the Irish town of Cahirciveen. It approached from th e northwest at about 1,000 feet at great speed and appeared to be revolving as if it were on an invisible axis. The cr aft had a kind of white halo and passed over without making a sound. Many observers were from outside the area, only being in town for the fair. Three names that were recorded as w itnesses were Michael J. O'Sullivan, J. Coffey, and Patrick O'Shea, all from Cahirciveen. The total ti me of the sighting approximated eleven seconds. 38 Chapter Five----A Very Serious Business 95 Then, in Italy at 10:30 P.M. local time, multiple \"luminous discs\" were seen above Garsenda. They flew from north to south as ma ny local citizens watched the spectacle. 39 Interesting, cases also came from South America in Paramaribo, Surinam, on the llth. 40 Yet, unexplainably, after this day widespread UFO activity suddenly slowed. Just like turning off a switch, people stopped seeing a phenomenon that had spanned the world and account ed for hundreds of reports. In comparison to the onslaught of sightings from the 4th to llth, less than two dozen good incidents would be reported during the rest of the year. Di d the news media simply stop c overing the sightings or did the phenomenon actually change in character? Only a few UFO reports, for example, can be found for the 12th. One comes from Spring Coulee, Alberta, Canada, but sounds suspiciously like a balloon sighting. 41 Then a man reported a"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"\"silver ball\" flying with a purring noise over Silver Lake, Washington, at noon. 42 Again in this case, it could be attributed to an IFO or identifie d flying object — very possibly a distant jet. Five incidents were reported in the Amer ican West on the 13th. Thr ee came from Grand Forks, North Dakota, in the afternoon. All describe bright revolvi ng objects traversing the sky. Then at 5:15 P.M. CST a Milwaukee Railroad sign al crew in Mussellshell, Mont ana, observed an irregularly moving round white object. 43 At 7:00 P.M. PST over Baker Valley, near Wingville, Oregon, a round object flying with a \"dipping motion\" was seen by many witnesse s and several aircraft pilots who tried in vain to pursue it. 44 On the 14th two reports came from Idaho onl y ten minutes apart. The first sighting occurred at 7:20 P.M. MST south of Idaho Falls. In this case a man described seeing a turning and twisting craft fly by on an irregular westward course. Ten minutes later, and to the west, in Nampa, Idaho, a dozen \"flying discs\" were seen by Mr. and Mrs. O.B. Warnock. 45 Two unrelated reports came from the 15t h, although both describe a strange \"fiery object.\" Distantly separated, however, the first incident occurred in Indonesia and the second in Utah. 46 On the 16th a sketchy report came from South Americ a and one from Rugby, North Dakota. In the latter case, a luminous revolving object was seen at 1:00 A.M. CST only 200 feet off the ground. 47 96 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Just one account is evident for the 17th, but it is a very unique sighting. In that instance multiple objects appeared at various levels above Helena , Montana, from 2:45 to 3:00 P.M. MST. Although, those accounts do liken them to simple balloon cl usters known to be in use at the time by the military. 48 On the 18th, however, two very notable day light disc sightings can be found. They begin with Mr. and Mrs. Roger Morin of Arlee, Montana, who spotte d two discs at 10:00 P.M. MST heading west. By 11:30 P.M. CST in Joplin, Missouri, one disc zoomed to the southeast looking like a \"silver meat platter.\" 49 No reports have surfaced for the 19th and only one for the 20th which occurred in Texas at 10:35 P.M. and very likely describes a rocket test. 50 The 21st has just one sighting in Boise, Idaho, desc ribing a fast moving oval object. 51 Only one report is of note for the 22nd. That case involves a sighting of a green fire ball above Fort McPherson, Georgia. That is of interest because one year later, green fireball sightings would be a widely reported phenomena above many military bases in the West. 52 Actually, the next day another green fireball did appear \"under the clouds\" over Belgium around midnight. It is the only reliable UFO report for the 23rd. 53 On the 24th, nighttime disc sightings came ^ from Ar vada, Wyoming, and Wolf Point, Montana. 54 Then on the 25th another evening sighting of a \"luminous saucer\" once again appeared over Montana near Whitetail. 55 That day a saucer sighting came from the other side of the A tlantic. In that case numerous witnesses spotted a flat disc-shaped obj ect travel over Odensala , Sweden, flying at about 400 meters altitude in an easte rly direction around 5:00 P.M. 56 26 July In Washington D.C. at noon President Truman waited on board the presidential aircraft Sacred Cow to sign some important documents before hurrying back to Missouri and his dying mother. Soon a courier arrived at National Airport carrying what proved to be far reaching legislation. With the signing of the National Security Act of 1947 and Executive Order 9877, the Army, Navy, and now the Air Force were coordinated as one military establishment under a single Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal. "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" Chapter Five----A Very Serious Business 97 This allowed the Army Air Force to become a separate branch of th e armed services under a new name, the United States Air Force, or USAF. Stuart Symington served as the first Secretary of the Air Force. (The three departments were separate ly presided over by a civilian Secretary, each of which became members of the new National Secu rity Council.) On September 26th General Carl Spaatz became the first Chief of Staff of the new US AF. (Each service's chief of staff would become members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.) General Ho yt Vandenberg then became Vice Chief of Staff on October 1st. Symington, Spaatz, and Vandenberg seldom spoke pub licly on UFOs, and what they did say seemed to indicate that the sightings posed no defense concerns. Whether they actually believed that may never be known, but the new Air Force via men like Alfred Loedding is known to have had a very real interest by this da te in the curious fl ying disc reports. 28 July A sighting very similar to the United Airlines Flight 105 Case occurred on this date on the same run as that noted July 4th incident. Captain Charles F. Gibian and First Officer Jack Harvey of this July 28th Flight 105 trip were preparing for a landing into Boise, Idaho, at 8:34 P.M. MST. As they lost altitude over Mountain Home (45 miles out from Bois e), Harvey spotted a stra nge craft far ahead of their DC-3. Just as Captain Smith described twen ty-four days earlier, Harvey characterized the bizarre object as silhouetted agains t a bright western sky. Captain Gibian then noticed the object and accounted that it appeared to be at 9,000 feet as their aircraft began descending from that same height to 8,000 feet. He described it as weaving as if \"it was goi ng through choppy air.\" Gibian also stated that it was \"going like hell when it disappeared\" toward the northwest. Both pilots agreed the object to be about the size of th eir own aircraft and about 40 miles distant. They also felt certain what they saw that day could not have been an aircra ft. Each stressed that they had never seen such a thing before and publicly expresse d concern that possibl e military experiments were being carried out in commercial air lanes. 57 29 July A sighting at Hamilton Field, Califo rnia, at the end of July repr esented one of those few truly exceptional cases that finished out the year. It definitely contribute d to Loedding's mounting interest in flying discs and determination to investigate deeper. 98 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Known as the Hamilton Field Incident, it began at 2:50 P.M. PST when Lieutenant Ward L. Stewart in the 415th reserve training unit landed in an AT-6 from a routine training flight and parked his aircraft near hangar 59. The Assistant Operations Officer, Captain William H. Ryherd, then called his attention to an odd object flying above the hangar. It headed right over a P-80 jet fighter coming in on a preliminary landi ng approach at around 6,000 feet. The P-80 flew in excess of 250 miles per hour as the unknowns proceeded to pass by the jet \"as"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"if it was standing still.\" A second object then appeared, flying a left to right \"protective\" maneuver over the first craft until they each passed southw ard toward Oakland and then out over the ocean. Both the captain and the lieutenant agreed the object s were 15 to 25 feet in diameter, shiny white in color, and circular-shaped. The to tal duration of their sighting last ed about fifteen seconds as the craft sped by in a clear sky. No noise could be de tected, but the observers felt they could not fairly judge that they were completely silent because of the background roar of the P-80. Lieutenant Stewart piloted B-29 bombers during the war and had considerable experience as a flyer. He conveyed authority to Intelligence officers when questioned, stating that the objects were \"unlike any conventional type of ai rcraft he had ever seen.\" Captain Ryherd also conveyed a highly impressive evaluation of the sighting with an extreme degree of sincerity throughout his testimony. 58 Given the opportunity, investigat ors should scan some of the Oakl and papers to see if any other UFO reports were made in connection with the Ha milton Field Incident. Many cases listed in this book have been discovered in just such a wa y. Uncovered in newspapers from areas near documented sightings, these secondary sources make it all the more evident something truly amazing took place in 1947. One other good sighting for the 29th is found in th e files of the FBI. It is of interest because it also describes an object not too dissimilar than th e two objects seen over Hamilton Field that day. Note the similarities in the report: At or about 12:05 p.m., July 29 , 1947, a sedan, driven by Stev e Berrmann and carrying R.J. (Bob) Madden in the front seat and Karl Herman in the rear seat, was proceeding northwesterly along the road leading from Canyon Ferry to York, both in Montana some 25 miles N.E. of Helena. When at a point approximately 1/4 mile N.W. of Canyon Ferry, (as shown on Forest Service Map to be in the NE1/4 of NE1/4 of Sec. 10 TION R1W) Karl suddenly shouted \"See it ! See it! There's a flying saucer!\" Steve immediately slowed down and grad ually brought the sedan to a stop, he and Bob meanwhile scanning the sky i in the direction pointed by Karl in an effort to see the \"flying saucer,\" but without success. Approximately ten seconds elapsed between the time Karl Chapter Five----A Very Serious Business 99 reported seeing the \"saucer,\" coming over the horizon at high speed from the southwest, (Karl first thought it a meteor) and traveling northeasterly, and the bringing of the car to a stop. As the car came to a stop, Steve, Karl and Bob, simultaneously, saw the following: Directly ahead, (N.W.) 2 to 3 miles distant an d approximately 3000 ft. abov e the ground, a bright disc hovering and fluttering in the air. Descending and rising through a vertical distance of fifty or a hundred feet for a period of about five seconds then, while at the top of an ascent, the \"disc\" suddenly swooped to the Northeast at tremendous speed and disappeared into the clear air within a distance of 200 ft. That is to say it did not pass beyond an obstruct ion to further visibility but \"melted into thin air\" as if because of tremendous speed. This disc was, from the viewpoint of the ob servers, apparently 3 ft. diamet er, circular and of no great thickness — approximately 3 or 4 inches. The sky was blue with scattered small clouds, the sun was shining brightly and the disc gleamed and shimmered in the bright sun light as if covered with highly polished nickel. After the \"disc\" disappeared from view, th e sedan and its occupants proceeded northwesterly along the road, but could discern no evidence of the pres ence of the \"disc\" along or adjacent to that thoroughfare. It is to be remembered that the dimensions as stated above were as they appeared to the observers some 2 or 3 miles from the \"disc\" and the true dimensions must be considerably greater. 59     /s/R.J.

ThePac.Tel.&Tel.Co. 30 July Ending out the last UFO report for the phenomenal mont h of July, this particular account deserves to be quoted in full. Although sightin gs dramatically fell off by this point, the case is extremely note worthy as evidence that very good encounters did occas ionally occur during the rest of the year. The witness involved was returning to his home in Es tevan, Saskatchewan, from the Canadian town of Torquay: A motorist driving close to daybreak with his he adlights on was watching storm clouds in the northeast. As he watched, something swept out of the clouds and passed overhead moving in a southeasterly direction. It glided down near the ground and then rose again and disa ppeared at a rapid rate of speed. The unidentified 100 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 object did not seem to be very high in the air. \"At first it looked like an aircraft wing that was on fire at both ends but when it passed overhead I could see that it was circular in shape. It looked to be about the size of a tractor wheel and about four foot thick. It was revolving and appeared to have flames or fire at the outside edges.\" I have laughed at the stories of these thin gs, but not any more; I was sc ared. The object was real. I kept looking around for someone else to witness it but there was nobody else in sight at the time.\" The motorist said the object was silent and remained visible for about 20 seconds. 60 The Hoaxes, 1 August Hoaxes have always existed in connection with any type of mysteri ous phenomenon. It is regrettable, but that's human nature. Often UFO re ports, legitimate or not, tell us more about the observer than the observation they make. Fortunate ly, because so many dedicated researchers over the years have become interested in UFO activit y, most hoaxes are eventual ly exposed. The serious approach taken by military intelligence in the early years also helped weed out and expose pranksters. Those investigators were very leery about hoaxes and fear ed the public, and especially the Pentagon's reaction, if they were found to have b een taken in by such a ruse. In typical military fashion intelligence officers did not \"fool around,\" and routinely relied on the FBI for background checks. Alfred Loedding, in particular, was careful to only concentrate on cases involving highly credible observers such as pilots. He also had that scientific knack for looking at data as a whole and not making conclusions based on any one particular event. Undoubtedly, however, witnesses who produ ced photos or physical evidence received the most attention by investigators. There are actually a good number of cases in the 1947 files of people claiming to have discovered pieces of \"flying sa ucers\" that had supposedly crashed or exploded somewhere near them. Equally surprising is that few of these were attempts to perpetrate a hoax. In almost all of those cases, Intelligence and/or the FBI determined the witnesses were genuinely fooled by objects that were indeed mysterious , but only in the manner in which they were discovered."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" There is even reference in both Air For ce and FBI files to the M ogul balloon project. This concerned one of those physical evidence cases a nd referred to several inquiries made by an Intelligence officer, and later FBI field agents, as to whether a particular fragment could have been a piece of Chapter Five----A Very Serious Business 101 debris from a \"Mogul.\" 61 (This obviously proves the Mogul project was not as secretive an operation as present-day Air Fo rce officials claim when debunki ng the Roswell Incident.) 62 The first well-documented UFO hoax in the ear ly files concerns two i ndividuals by the name of Harold A. Dahl and Fred Lee Crisman. They had made the claim that six low-flying UFOs hovered over their boat on June 21st while they were looking for floating lumber off Maury Island near Tacoma, Washington. Subsequently it became known as the Maury Island Incident when they confessed under FBI interrogation to a hoax. This occurred after the Brown and Davidson Army Intelligence team was tragically killed returning from Tacoma after interviewing Dahl and Crisman. Attributed simply to an unfortunate plane crash, their accident had no real connection to the case. It is also unfortunate that Kenneth Arnold became a victim of these hoaxers. Although he did not lose his life as the result of th eir ignorant deeds, he did lose something he considered just as valuable, his reputation. This conc ern for his reputation had made Arnold desperate to learn more about the curious flying saucers following his own sighting in J une and a second one on July29th. 63 Arnold sought any proof he could and became in terested in the Maury Isla nd case after the editor of Amazing Stories magazine, Ray Palmer, agreed to put up $200 to help him i nvestigate their claim. Arnold, however, could not have be en kept away from such a story. It was outwardly such a good sighting because the witnesses were actually claiming to have pieces of \"slag\" expelled by one of the saucers after it had supposedly encountered mechan ical problems. They al so purportedly captured the saucers on film which captivated Arnold more than anything else. Even Captain E.J. Smith of the United Airlines Flight 105 Case became taken by th e hoaxers out of that same need—the need for proof. Seeking to substantiate any possible pr oof that did exist, Arnol d had personally convinced Lieutenant Brown, who had worked on his case, to travel to Tacoma. Br own and Davidson both took advantage of the offer and flew up to Tacoma to meet with Dahl and Chrisman while they were being interviewed by Arnold and Smith in a hotel room at the Winthrop. 102 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 Once on the scene the more experienced Brown and Davidson saw the story as an obvious hoax, but because the officers held such a high degree of respect for both Arnold and Smith, they did not indicate to them their feelings a nd subsequently allowed themselves to be talked into taking some of the alleged fragments back for study. Flying back to Hamilton Field to take pa rt in the Air Force Day cer emonies, an engine caught fire and the wing came off of their B-25 near Kelso, Washington, killing both Brown and Davidson. The fragments were recovered from the wreckage, and after careful analysis proved to be simple slag from a local Tacoma steel mill. The military threat ened to prosecute Dahl and Chrisman but never carried through with it. But because they hesitated to disclose the case as a hoax while considering"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"prosecution, many thought the sighti ng to represent a true event. The press made a lot out of it at the time a nd for some reason even erroneously stated that the Air Force had ceased disc investigatio ns altogether. When the real st ory came out months later, buried on the back pages, people missed the explanation. As a result, some still naively detail the Maury Island Incident, alluding that it may not have been a hoax. 64 Because of that mistaken perception, so pe rvasive at the time, the first step had been taken which, over the years, would make the military more and more defensive in regard to the media. Even Arnold, held in high regard by early investigat ors, is treated only with ridicule following the whole tragic event. Afterward, when an article came out critical of the Arnold sighting, TID clerks automatically added it to his file. Intelligence o fficers around the country felt they had learned a valuable lesson from the incident—caution. 4 August Every researcher has their own favorite cases fo r certain periods. The following sighting from Alaska is a particularly attractiv e story for two reasons. First, th is incident received detailed documentation in the military files which usually wa s not the case with a sighting in such a distant location. Secondly, the incident is ty pical of a lot of air-to-air sightings of the early days, not only in the manner in which it occurred, but the description of the object seen. In fact, when compared to the United Airlines Flight 105 Case of July 4th, the similarities are stri king. Also comparable is the time of day in which both sightings took place. Surpri singly, this account is seldom mentioned in the popular literature. The incident began northwest of Bethel, Alaska, when DC-3 Captai n Jack Peck and copilot Vince Daly of Al Jones Flying Service were on a Chapter Five----A Very Serious Business 103 routine cargo run. At dusk they sudd enly sighted a black saucer-shaped object cross their flight path. It had come in at a right angle to their aircraft and Peck instin ctively made a precautionary climb from 1,000 to 1,200 feet to avoid any chance of collision. He then swung in behind the disc and chased the peculiar looking craf t as it became silhouetted agains t a brilliant evening sky. Peck pursued at 170 miles per hour until lo sing sight of it four minutes later. During the incident they noted that the disc had a smooth streamlined surface with no visible means of propulsion. The speed of the object was subsequently computed at 510 miles per hour, based on the assumption that the UFO traveled 34 miles in four minutes while the DC-3 moved eleven miles in the same period. If correct, this would also infer that the craft was more than twenty miles distant when last seen. To be able to see an object at that distance, it would indicate a diameter of at least 50 feet and sugge sts a length of about 500 feet. Aside from such startling figures, the Beth el Alaska Case drew atte ntion within Intelligence among men like Loedding because of the quality of observers. The airline also considered Captain Peck as a man with an \"excellent reputation.\" A le tter in the Air Force file s speaks to his character, stating \"no one here doubts in the least but that he actually saw this object.\" 65 6 August By the fall of 1947 the FBI had become very act ive in UFO investigations. The following FBI"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"memorandum was drafted by the Philadelphia, Penns ylvania, field office and addressed to FBI Director J. Edgar Hover. It demonstrates that although Intelligence in Dayton would soon begin a twenty-two year investigations into UFOs, other organizations like the FBI did substantial work as well in these early years. This memo did make it into Intelligence files at Wright Field but not all of the FBI paperwork seems to have been shared with them. Corres pondence from August even indicates Loedding urging the T-2 Analysis Division (which he was working for on the disc sigh ting) to give direction to A-2 Intelligence, Fourth Air Force at Hamilton Field, and via them direction to the FBI. Was this a show of frustration that Wright Field may not have been receiving the cooperation th at they should have as directed by Washington following the Muroc Sightings? This me mo does shows a sincere and worthy effort by Special Agents to conduct an investigation into this particular sighting: 104 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 ____________________Philadelphia, who is employed by the _________, Philadelphia, advised as follows: Between 10:30 and 10:45 p.m. on August 6, 194 7, she was sitting on the steps of her home with _______.

FFB/ctg 98-1762 66 106 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 13 August One of the most interesting featur es of the 1947 period is the sheer num ber of disc sightings. This is not to say there was not a dive rsity of phenomena reported, but many of these \"disc or saucer accounts\" are extremely noteworthy because few other periods had such high percentages of observations describing true \"nuts and bolts\" type objects. For example, an above average daylight disc sighting of late 1947 comes fr om the Smoke River Canyon near Tw in Falls, Idaho. On this date at 1:00 P.M. MST a blue disc-shaped object actually flew beneat h the walls of that canyon river valley! On its flight, the strange craft sped above a well respected area trout farmer, A.C. Urie. His two sons, Keith and Billy, also w itnessed the event as they were coming across the river to meet their father with a boat. All th ree witnesses then watched it pa ss about 75 feet over a stand of Mormon Poplars, causing the tree tops to bend and sw ay as if caught in a vacuum. By that point the craft, which had descended as much as 300 feet below the 400 feet high canyon rim, became silhouetted against its steep walls, resembling an \"inverted pie-plate. \" Urie estimated it to be about"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"twenty feet wide by ten feet thic k with a horizontal pipe or pole sticking o ut which emitted brigh t flam es. 67 The for mer county sheriff and a county co mm issioner, L.W .

They stated th at they flew on a zig-zag course at least twice as fast as a conventional airplane. 70 These authors could not track down the primary source for this account but the incident is listed in an index of sightings in the Fourth Air Force files, although no case analysis is evident. 71 17 August In the Mt. Josephine, Skagit County forest of Washington State, a ranger observed a flying disc similar to the object seen in Tw in Falls, Idaho. That UFO descende d rapidly from the northeast and flew with a slight angular pitch, but righted itself as it came lower. Finally the unusual machine flew off to the southeast at great speed. 72 Also that day two army officers at Fort Richardson, Alaska, stated that they saw an unusual object flying above them at a tremendous rate of speed below the cloud la yer then at 10,000 feet. The records state that the officers described the craft as sphere sh aped—not saucer-like. They noted, however, that unlike a balloon it definitely move d against the wind and had a metallic appearance. 73 19 August Another sighting comes from Twin Falls, Idaho, at 9:39 P.M. MST when nu merous people sighted multiple groups of flying objects in the night sky. These formations resembled a \"glow in the air\" the color of electric lights. The \"lights\" traveled at \"terrific speed\" and flew in triangular formations. At one point three of them peeled-off of a larger group of ten and sped away in a different direction. Due to an overcast, the observers felt that they were not astronomical anomalies. 74 Apparently many agencies were looking in to this sighting including the FBI. On August 22nd the following memo was composed by the FBI: Chapter Five----A Very Serious Business 109 In accordance with your request, this matter was checked with Army Air Forces. Lieutenant Colonel Garrett advised Special Agent _______ that extensive inqui ries within the Army Air Forces revealed that no research or experiments were being conducted by the AAF in the vicinity of Twin Falls, Idaho on or"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"about August 19, 1947. Colonel Garrett stated that he had no information which would throw any light on the matter reported in the teletype. 75 If, on the other hand, the Idaho UFOs could ha ve been explained away as aircraft or meteors, it would have surprised few. By August the Gallup poll revealed over 90 percent of adult Americans had heard of flying saucers, but that people continued to feel they represented secret military craft or natural phenomena. 76 Thus, even after the summer wave of 1947, the public still looked upon human achievements in science and engineering with the same sens e of wonder they had since the beginning of the modern technological revolu tion around the time of the 1897 UFO wave. Our present-day mind set associating \"flying saucers\" w ith extraterrestrial visitors simply had not yet taken hold. It is interesting to not e that even research scientist at the Hollom an AFB, who worked around the latest technologies, made no conclusions when they had discs sightings themselves that month. The events are detailed by an official st atement drawn up by Operati ons and Projects Group, Electronic and Atmosphere Division personnel wh ich Alfred Loedding spoke to a year later— actually while investigating an entirely different case: During the latter part of Au gust, 1947, this organization was carrying on several test runs with a modified SCR-270 at this base. I had release d a corner reflector and two balloons and was watching them in their flight as they drifted to the southeast from this base. While watching the balloons through a pair of ten power binoculars, a white object, appearing to be round, came into my field of vision, I followed the objects as far as possible but lost it within seconds after picking it up. The object was traveling at an unprecedented rate of speed and appeared to be sev eral thousand feet over the top of the Sacramento mountain range, traveling in horizontal flight sout h to north ... it was definitely not a balloon and apparently not manned judging from the violent mane uvers which were performed at a high rate of speed. 77 3 September On this day at 12:15 P.M. PST twelve to fift een circular-shaped objec ts appeared high above Oswego, Oregon. Each of the stra nge craft were described as 110 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 \"very silvery in the afternoon sun.\" While such a report sou nds like it might simply be a misidentification of aircraft or meteors, Inte lligence officers could find no such solution. They became sufficiently impressed with the observation to list it as unidentified in the Air Force's record system of sightings started by 1948. As stated before , that classification was never lightly given and even exceptional cases such as the DC-3 encount er over Bethel, Alaska, did not receive such a discriminating designation. 78 12 September Although most UFO reports in 1947 do describe saucer-shaped obj ects, nighttime lights again appeared on this date. This strange incident involved a Pan Ameri can flight eastbound from Midway Island to Cahu. Just after passing Ne cher Island at 1:00 A.M. local time, the crew spotted an intense incandescent white light off the star board side of their aircraft. At first the pilot thought it might be the navigation lights of another plan e, but it was far too bright for that. The flight crew tracked the unknown object and determined it held a true course of 350 degrees while holding at a steady"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"altitude of 9,500 feet. The captain estimated its distance from their aircraft at five miles. Bu t just as he took the plane off automatic pilot, the light approached within on e mile. After that the UFO quickly veered off to a course of 190 degrees at which time the light spli t into two parts. The two separate orbs then changed to a less bright reddish hue and flew in a side-to-side formation until zooming out of sight at tremendous speed, estimated at over 1,000 miles per hour. Investigators calculated the total duration of the observation at only six seconds, but as any pilot will attest to, that is a long time when an unknown obj ect is near your aircraft . Despite the brevity of the sighting, Naval Intelligence took a great deal of interest in the case. The pilots were interviewed by Naval officers who tried to find an astronomical solution to their unpre cedented encounter but realized the pilots had good familiarity with meteor phenomena. The pilots told Navy officers that they were certain they had not seen a meteor b ecause it consistently held a steady altitude. The captain of the flight had ten y ears flying experience with Pan Amer ican with 7,000 hours in the air, much of it over the Atlantic and Pacific air r outes. His second officer had 1,700 hours and eleven years of flying experience—four ye ars of which were spent in B-24s flying East Coast training duty and combat missions in the South Pacific. Both pilots impressed intelligence officers as keen observers. 79 1. The Roswell Report, Fact Versus Fi ction in the New Mexico Desert. 2.

On this occasion he saw 20 to 25 discs which were rough appearing on top and lighter on the bottom. As these objects flew, Arnold estimated them to be 24 to 30 inches in diameter and flying at speeds faster than 200 miles per hour.

"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" Chapter Six The Birth of Project Sign The Air Materiel Command's Technical Intelligen ce Division (hereafter referred to as AMC and TID) developed a growing interest in such diverse reports as those from the Pacific. Since the Muroc Sightings, TID officers had compiled information which formed the basis of later case files. Most of the paperwork, however, was first generated by Ai r Force or Naval Intelligence officers from military bases nearest to a sighting or from the h eadquarters of the 4th Air Force at Hamilton Field. Recent releases of federal records indicate that the FBI was also engaged in extensive field work and interrogation of witnesses. At times military inte lligence officers even \"warned\" some witnesses not to talk about their reports. 1 By September, growing demands for an answer to the incidents led to increasing pressure on the newly formed USAF. On September 23, 1947, AMC commander, Lieutenant General Nathan F. Tw ining, replied to a verbal request from Brigadier General Schulgen of Pentagon Intelligence for TID's an alysis to date. Now known as the Twining Memo, it made some interesting conclusions: 1. As requested by AC/AS-2 there is presented belo w the considered opinion of this command concerning the so-called \"Flying Discs.\" This op inion is based on int errogation report data furnished by AC/AS-2 and preliminary studies by personnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory, Engineering Divi sion T-3. This opinion was arrived at in a conference betw een personnel from the Air Institut e of Technology, Intelligence T-2, Office, Chief of Engineering Divi sion, and the Aircraft, Power Plant and Prope ller Laboratories of Engineering Division T-3. 2. It is the opinion that: a. The phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious. b. There are objects probably approximating the shape of a disc, of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made aircraft c. There is a possibility that some of the incidents may be caused by natural phenomena, such as meteors. d. The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of _________climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and motion which must 1 112 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying saucer Wave of 1947 be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief to the possibility that some of the obj ects are controlled either manual ly, automatically or remotely. e. The apparent common de scription is as follows: (1) Metallic or light reflecting surface. (2) Absence of trail, except in a few instances wh ere the object apparently was operating under high performance conditions. (3) Circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on top. (4) Several reports of well kept formation flights varying from three to nine objects. (5) Normally no associated soun d, except in three instances a su bstantial rumbling roar was noted. (6) Level flight speeds normally above 300 knots are estimated. "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"f. It is possible within the present U.S. know ledge—provided extensive detailed development is undertaken—to construct a piloted aircraft which has the general description of the object in subparagraph (e) above which would be capable of an approximate range of 7000 miles at subsonic speeds. g. Any development in this country along the lin es indicated would be extremely expensive, time consuming and at the considerable ex pense of current projects and therefo re, if directed, should be set up independently of existing projects. h. Due consideration must be given the following: (1) The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin—the product of some high security project not known to AC/AS-2 or this Command. (2) The lack of physical evidence in the shape of cr ash recovered exhibits which would undeniably prove the existence of these subjects. (3) The possibility that some foreign nation has a form of propulsion possibly nuclear, which is outside of our domestic knowledge. 3. It is recommended that:- a. Headquarters, Army Air Forces is sue a directive assigning a priority, security classification and Code name for a detailed study of this matter to include th e preparation of complete sets of all available and pertinent data which will then be made available to the Army, Navy, Atomic Energy Commission, JRDB, the Air Force Scientific Advisory Group, NACA, an d the RAND and NEPA pr ojects for comments and recommendations, with a preliminary report to be forwar ded within 15 days of rec eipt of the data and a detailed report thereafter every 30 days as the invest igation develops. A complete interchange of data should be affected. 4. Awaiting a specific directive AMC w ill continue the investigation within its current resources in order to more closely define the nature of the phenomenon. Detailed Essential Elements of Information will be formulated immediately for transmittal through channels. 2 Chapter Six---The Birth of Project Sign 113 The Twining Memo strongly urged that a permanent project be established to investigate and analyze future UFO reports. On December 30, Major General Laurence C. Craigie, Director of Research and Development, Headqu arters, USAF, issued an order approving a group \"to collect, collate, evaluate and distribute to interested government agencies and contractors all information concerning sightings and phenomena in the atmosphere which can be construed to be of concern to the national security.\" This led to the establishment at the Air Materiel Command of Project HT-304, code name \"Project Sign,\" under Air Force T echnical Instruction No. TI-2185. Qu arterly progress reports were ordered to be submitted beginning July 1, 1948, alt hough only one of those reports have been found in the records from the time. Much of the same thinking from earlier that summer which linke d UFOs to German/Soviet technology lay at the heart of the Twining Memo and the creation of Sign. For that reason most researchers believe TID commander Colonel Howard M. McCoy actually drafted the document—as it was worded from the perspective of his wartime experience in T-2 Intelligence. McCoy had been a key figure in the rec overy of German technology during the war. Although he did not work directly on Operation PaperClip to recruit German scientists, he did value the expertise they could provide. Many of these groups men tioned in the Twining Memo like the Rand Think Tank and the Air Force Scientific Advisory Group (NASA's predecessor) utilized German scientific breakthroughs in their own work. The Twining Memo called for an Essentia l Elements of Information or EEI document—which also referenced the military's wartime experience with evaluating technology. The EEI served as a check list of important details to note about a si ghting—for example shape of object, trajectory, time"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"of event, etc. Alfred Loedding and Pentagon cons ultant Dr Charles Carroll drew up the EEI. It was then sent to all Army Air Force commands to se rve as a basis for investigating a UFO incident. In late 1947 the EEI, combined with a de tailed Collection Memorand um from General Schulgen, was hand-distributed within the European Comm and by Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm Seashore (a former chief of T-2 Analysis section). It is apparent from reading the memo that Intelligence still wanted European commands to be on the lookout for a possible German/Soviet link to the discs. Frequent mention of the Horten brother's flying wing designs in this document is the most st riking example of this concern. Many of its points clearly stress Alfred Loeddi ng's input from an aeronauti cal engineering perspective: 114 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying saucer Wave of 1947 AIR INTELLIGENCE GUIDE For ALLEGED \"FLYING SAUC ER TYPE AIRCRAFT\" An alleged \"Flying Saucer\" Type aircraft or object in flight!' approxim ating the shape of a disc has been reported by many observers from widely scattered places, such as the United States,, Alaska, Canada, Hungary, the Island of Guam, Japan, etc. This object has been reported by many competent observers. Sightings have been made from the ground as well as from the air. Commonly reported features that are very significant and which may aid in the investigation are as follows: a. Relatively flat bottom with extremely light reflecting ability. b. Absence of sound except for an occasional roar when operating under super performance conditions. c. Extreme maneuverability and appa rent ability to almost hover. d. A plan form approximating that of an oval or disc with a dome shape on the top surface. e. The absence of an exhaust trail except in a few inst ances when it was reported to have bluish color like a Diesel exhaust which persisted for approximately on e hour. Other reports indi cated a brownish smoke trail that could be the results of a special catalyst or chemical agent for extra power. f. The ability to quickly disappear by high speed or by complete disintegration. g. The ability to suddenly appear without warn ing as if from an extremely high altitude. h. The size most reporte d approximated that of a C-54 or Constellation aircraft i. The ability to group together very quickly in a tight formation when mo re than one aircraft were together. j. Evasive action ability indicates possibility of bein g manually operated, or possibly by electronic or remote control devices. k. Under certain conditions, the craft seems to have the ability to cut a clear pa th through clouds—width estimated to be approximately one-half mile. Only one incident indi cated this phenomenon. The first sightings in the U.S. w ere reported around the middle of May. The last reported sighting took place in Toronto, Canada, 14 September 1947. The greate st activity in the U.S. was during the last week of June and the first week of July. This strange object or phenomenon may be considered, in view of certain obser vations, as a long-range aircraft capable of a high rate of climb, high cruisi ng speed (possibly subsonic at all times) and highly maneuverable and capable of being low in very tight formation. For the purpose of analysis and evaluation of the so-called \"Flying Saucer\" phen omenon, the object sighted is being assumed to be a manned aircraft, of Russian origin, and based on the perspective thinking and actual accomplishments of the German. There is also the possibility that the Horten Brothers perspective thinking may "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" Chapter Six---The Birth of Project Sign 115 have inspired this type of aircraft and particular ly the \"Parabola\" which has a crescent plan form. Records show that a glider version only was built of this type aircraft. It is reported to have been built in Heilengenberg, Germany, but was destroyed by fire befo re having ever flown. The Horten Brothers latest trend of perspective thinki ng was definitely toward aircraft configurations of low aspect ratio. The younger brother, Reimar, stated that the \"Parabola\" configuration would have the least induced drag which is a very significant statement. The theory supporting this statemen t should be obtained. The German High Command indicated a definite interest in the Horten type of flying wing and were about to embark on a rigorous campaign to develop such ai rcraft toward the end of the war. A Horten design known as the IX which was designated as the Go-8-229 and Go-P-60 (night fighter) was to be manufactured by the Gotha Plant. It is reported that a contract of fifty such aircraft was planned but only three or four were built. This plant is in the hands of the Russians. A recent report indicates that the Russians are now planning to build a fleet of 1800 Horten VIII (six engi ne pusher) type flying wing aircraft The wing span is about 131 feet The sweep-back angle is 30 degrees. The Russian version is reported to be jet propelled. Answers to the following questions, therefore, are requested: a. What German scientist had a better than aver age knowledge of the Horten Brothers work and perspective thinking; where are these scientists now located, and what is their present activity? Contact and interrogate them. b. What Russian factories are building the Horten VIII design? c. Why are the Russians building 1 800 of the Horten VIII design? d. What is their contemplated tactical purpose? e. What is the present activity of the Horten Brothers, Walter and Reimar? f. What is known of the whereabout s of the entire Horten family, partic ularly the sister? All should be contacted and interrogated regarding any contemplated plans or perspective thinki ng the Horten Brothers and any interest shown by the Russians to develop their aircraft. g. Are any efforts being made to develop the Horten \"Parabola\" or modify this configuration to approximate an oval or disc? h. What is the Horten perspective th inking on internal controls or cont rols that are effective mainly by streams of air or gas originating from within th e aircraft to supplant conven tional external surface controls? For any aircraft approximating that of an oval, disc or saucer, information regard ing the following items is requested. a. Boundary layer control method by suction, blowing or a combination of both. b. Special controls for effectiv e maneuverability at very slow sp eeds or extremely high altitudes. c. Openings either in the leading ed ge top and bottom surfaces that 116 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying saucer Wave of 1947 are employed chiefly to accomplish boundary layer control or for th e purpose of reducing the induced drag. Any openings in the leading edge should be reported and described as to shape, size, etc. This investigation is significant to justify a disc shape configuration for long-range application. d. Approximate airfoil shape in the center and near the tips. e. Front view and rear view shape. Items of Construction a. Material whether metal, ferro us, non-ferrous, or non-metallic. b. Composite or sandwich construction utilizing vario us combinations of meta ls, plastics, and perhaps balsa wood. "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"c. Unusual fabrication methods to achieve extreme light weig ht and structural stab ility particularly in connection with great capacity for fuel storage. Items of Arrangement a. Special provisions such as retractable domes to provide unusual observation for the pilot or crew members. b. Crew number and accommodation facilities. c. Pressurized cabin equipment d. High altitude or high speed escarpment methods. e. Methods of pressurization or supercharging fr om auxiliary units or from the prime power plant f. Provisions for towing esp ecially with short fixed bar and for refueling in flight. g. Provisions for assisted take off applications. h.

Indicate type of landing gear whether conventional, tricycle, multiple wheel, etc. b. Retractable and jettison features for hand gear. c. Provisions for take-off from ice, snow, or water. d. Skid arrangements for ei ther take-off or landing. Power Plant Item a. Information is needed regarding the propulsion syst em used in the aircraft Possible types of engines that could be employed include: (1) Reciprocating (piston type) engine or gas turbine. Either or both of these could be used to drive propellers of conventional or special design , rotating vanes, ducked fans or compressors. (2) Jet propulsion engines including turbo jets, rockets, ramjets, pulse jets or a combination of all four. (3) Nuclear propulsion (atomic energ y). Atomic energy engines would probably be unlike any familiar type of engine, alth ough atomic energy might be employed in combin ation with any of the above types. Aircraft would be characterized by lack of fu el storage space. The po wer plant would likely be an integral part of the aircraft and could possibly not be dist inguished as an item separated from the Chapter Six---The Birth of Project Sign 117 aircraft. If jet propulsion is used, large air handling capacity characterized by a large air inlet area and large exhaust nozzle should be evident. The size of entrance and exit areas would be of interest. It is possible that the propulsive jet is governed or influenced for control of the aircraft. The presence of vanes or control surfaces in the exhaust or methods of changing the direction of the jet should be observed. Information desired on the propulsion sy stems pertains to the following items: a. Type of power plant or power plants. b. General description. c. Rating (thrust, ho rsepower, or air flow). d. Type of fuel. e. Catalytic agents for super-performance or normal cruising power. 3 Officially Sign began on Feb. 11, 1948, although work under that code name had already commenced on January 26th. When General Craigie ga ve tentative approval to the project back on December 30th, he appointed Sign a \"2A priority,\" the second highest, and a security classification of \"restricted,\" the lowe st rating. Sign and later Grudge code names were kept secret, but their existence became widely known and referred to in the press as \"Project Saucer.\" Sign worked"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"through a system of channels. Air Force Intelligence officers statione d at the nearest air base to a sighting, or in some cases Naval Intelligence, usua lly conducted the first i nvestigations. After that, cases went to AMC and from there down to TID's Sign officers within the Analysis division. A Sign investigator or extra staff person from somewher e within TID or even AMC would then sometimes be dispatched to a sighting location if further in vestigation was warranted. At times the FBI did the initial interrogation of witnesses and their reports were literary cut a nd pasted together to form many of the Sign case files. Other files were completed by the Sign team and/or by other intelligence personnel closer to a given UFO event. These we re filed not just in Dayton, but with any government agency which could be of assistance, in cluding some original pa perwork going directly to Air Force Headquarters in the Pentagon. Some of the initial investigat ive paperwork, in fact, apparently never went through the Sign project at all, but straight to Washington. By early 1948 Air Force Headquarters ordered TID to make copies of all their UFO files and forward them to the Office of Naval Intelligence and other government agenci es that could be of a ssistance. By that point many of the Sign files began to be 118 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying saucer Wave of 1947 microfilmed but were of poor quality, indicating that they were meant only for inter-service use. Some investigative work may have b een conducted by military units eventually designated ATIC Detachment 1, 2, and 3. These were classified units which had been established during World War II to recover Japanese Fugo balloons. Fugos, load ed with incendiary bombs, were launched into the jet stream as a desperate attempt by the Japanese to strike back at th e United States. When the Japanese started to seriously c onsider arming the balloons with biological weapons, the Western Defense Command surrounded the recovery units w ith secrecy. After the war many of the teams were apparently kept in place in the event other countries might try to threaten North America with similar balloon warfare. Air Force Colonel Robert Fr iend later stated that these units were used to conduct UFO investigations up through 1953. They, howev er, reported to an intermediate level in Virginia and their reports did not go directly to Sign or the late r Grudge and Blue Book projects. 4 Captain Robert R. Snei der technically headed up the Sign team (referred to as MCIAXO-3) while serving under TID Chief, Colonel McCoy, and TID Analysis division Chief, Colonel William R. Clingerman. Sneider, however, seems to have merely been the military administrator with Loedding initially assuming the role of a working director of th e team. A few notable members on the Sneider/Loedding staff were, Lawrence H. Truett ner (missile specialist), Nicholas Post, John H. Zell, George W. Towles, John \"Red\" Honnacker, Lieutenant Colonel Miles Goll (who may have technically supervised engineeri ng specialists like Loedding while at Intelligence), Major Raymond A. Llewellyn, and Lieutenant Howard W. Smith. Ma jor Melvin W. Faulk also lent assistance until transferred in June of 1948. By early 1948 Albert Bonnelle Deyarmond (a reserve Army Air Force colonel) also became a key team member. Most of these individuals were highly trained technical intelligence engineers who had worked on UFO related casework as early as July while serving in or assisting TID's Analysis division. Alfred Loedding, as state d, had come to Wright Labs back in 1938 where he won a reputation as a brilliant technical i nnovator in the T-3 Engineering sec tion. Loedding consulted on early UFO investigations not only because he was a leading au thority on flying wing airc raft design, but he was also recognized as one of the few in the United St ates who had personal expe rience in rocketry. He had, in fact, become chief of the first Jet Pr opulsion Laboratory at Wright Field in 1940. In Loedding's resume he stated that while there, \"I pioneered the work in rocket type engines ... I "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" Chapter Six---The Birth of Project Sign 119 initiated and monitored all work that finally re sulted in a modern and complete Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1943.\" 5 After that Loedding went to work at the Armament Laboratory on the development of another projec t of his, the hydrobomb. The hydrobomb was a type of underwater rocket-propelled torpedo that was to be carried by aircraft for anti-ship warfare. While in this project Loedding served as the chief liaison with private contractors but apparently ran against military procedure in his work. As a result of that he resigned from the proj ect in disgust with the wasteful management of time and resources that the milita ry bureaucracy exhibited in its own efforts to develop weapons systems. After that Loedding realized weapons production must be entruste d with private industry. Nevertheless, Wright Field continued to use him as a military liaison and trouble shooter with other industries involved in 1 ^ gove rnment war production contracts. This included work on the B-29 project and its successor, the B-50. During this time Loedding personally contributed to the solving of the engine fires that plagued so many B-29s co ming out of the first production runs. He was then sent to coordinate on the first stages of development of the huge nuclear B-36 bomber. While on the B-36 project he assisted with th e shaping and forming of magnesiu m alloy sheet metal at the B-36 plant in Fort Worth, Texas. After the war he briefl y worked full time at Patterson Field for the T-2 intelligence section. We do not know what he worked on at the time, but soon Alfred was back to work in the T-3 Engineering section. Apparently by then he worked mainly in research and development projects and was still us ed as a corporate liaison and technical assistant. He wrote that at that time, \"I visited major aircraft companie s and manufacturing concerns, such as the Aluminum Company of America and their sub-contractors to solve manufacturing difficulties and tooling problems. I also visited various other plants th roughout the country and was solely responsible for examination of their manufacturing ability and then recommending the awarding of contracts to Procurement Division.\" By February 17, 1946 Loedding returned to T-2. He wrote that at that time: I joined the Analysis Division . . . and took a leadin g part in organizing the Aircraft Section. I created the Supersonic Unit and became Chief for approximately two months. I was then advanced to Civilian Chief, Aircraft Section, and supervised the Section jointly with the Military Ch ief, which was th e policy at that time. I held that position from April until June, and was then loaned to the Office of the Technical Assistant in order to replace Major Ryan, who was scheduled to leave in July; I took complete charge of the Office of the Technical Assi stant on 1 August 1946, after Major Ryan resigned in July. 6 120 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying saucer Wave of 1947 From August 1946 to May 1949 Loedding offici ally worked as the \"Tec hnical Assist ant to the Chief of the Technical Analysis Division of MCI A.\" (MCIA was TID's WWII era predecessor which was called the Materiel Command Intellig ence or MCI of | the Air Technical Service Command—forerunner to AMC. In this case In telligence Analysis was called MCIA—A for Analysis.) During this time, aside from what wo uld become an active job in UFO investigations, Loedding also supervised the offices of Guided Mi ssiles and Foreign Industrial Facilities. It is unclear why, but although Loedding was technically employed by T-2 Intelligence then based at Patterson Field, he retained his office at Wright Fiel d and may have still worked in some capacity for T-3 Engineering. In Loedding's resume he charact erized his duties at th is time as follows:"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" Alfred Loedding I was authorized to si gn all r outine c orresponde nce unde r the juris dicti on of the Tec hnical Assistant's Office whe n on a Di vision level.

T his involved a m eeting with General Schulgen an d Dr. Charle s Carroll who was a m athem atics and m issile ex pert. They m et initia lly to discuss a radar sighting in Fukuoka, Japan, but L oedding attended other m eetings as well on the disc sighting s. L oedding also worked with Lieutenan t Colonel Ga rrett f rom the Air Force Inte llig ence, Collections Division in the Penta gon. As already exam ined, Loeddi ng m ay have assisted Garrett on his prelim inary estim ate of the current UF O situation back in July. (See page 83.) Loedding initially concentrated on a Germ an/Soviet answ er to the disc sightings as m any did. Perhaps th is was because at the tim e he was working with m any of the form er Nazi rocket scientis ts who were then being utilized by W right Labs.

Deyarm ond did not officially jo in the Sign team until May of 1948 because he had taken a job at the Ryan Aeronautical Com pany in San Diego from December 1946 to April 1948. He had left activ e serv ice at th e end of 1946 due to m inor health problem s but retained his rank as a reserve officer. It is believed McCoy requested Deyarm ond' s return to active duty to help with the saucer inves tiga tion as e arly as July 1947, but his health prevented it. McCoy, however, finally got Deyarm ond on the team by 1948 as a civilian em ployee. His influence in the project' s later work is very evident. Like Loedding, he was a gifted engineer and also had an aptitude for m issile aerodynam ics. Yet, Deyarm ond was not as outwardly vocal on the possibility of an extraterrestrial conn ection to UFOs as Loedding. That belief in an extraterrestrial conn ection seem s to have becom e a very touchy subject.

In 1947 Carl Spaatz as Ch ief of Staff was the top au thority figure. However,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Spaatz figures very little into the UFO story beca use his junior executive, General Hoyt Vandenberg, would soon replace him. Under both Spaatz and Vande nberg was the office of Intelligence known as The Directorate of Intelligence, eventually referre d to as AFOIN. General George McDonald served as Chief of Air Force Intelligence in 1947. But, li ke Spaatz, he figures very little into the UFO picture because it would be his executive officer , Brigadier George Schulgen, who would affect policy. We have already seen how Schulgen mob ilized the first efforts to look into the UFO sightings after the July 8th Muroc Sightings. He al so inspired the Twining Memo later that year which led to the formation of Project Sign by 1948. But following in McDonald's and Schulgen's shoes in 1948 was Major General Charles Pearre Cabell. Cabell would end up having significant influence on Air Force policy concerning UFOs, sett ing the stage for Project Blue Book in late 1951. Pentagon Intelligence had its own divisi ons. Under AFOIN were the Air Force Office of Intelligence Requirements branch or AFOIR and the Air Force Office of Air Intelligence or AFOAI. The former (AFOIR) included the Collections branch known as AFOIR-CO. It was in this office we find Colonel Garrett working under his ex ecutive officer Colonel Robert Taylor. Chapter Six---The Birth of Project Sign 123 As we have seen, Garrett was the one who worked with the FBI and soon Alfred Loedding from Dayton. He also became personall y sympathetic with the developi ng viewpoint that many of the flying disc reports represent \"rea l technological objects.\" Like Loeddi ng, this at first meant German technology but their belief changed to an extr aterrestrial hypothesis by the beginning of 1948. Not only were Garrett, and soon Taylor, am ong this pro-UFO Pentagon faction, but also Colonel Frank Dunn, who worked in the main office. (Dunn w ould later be head of Intelligence at Dayton from September 1951 to August 1952 during the heyda y of Project Blue Book.) Major William A. Adams of the Documents and Dissemination Office was also an open-minded individual working in Pentagon Intelligence. Adams, like Dunn, would be very influential in the UFO picture by 1952. 9 On the other side of the Pentagon spectru m were officers from AFOAI. These men served as an \"analysis\" division. Under that heading could be found those who were \" non sympathetic\" to the UFO phenomenon. Such individuals worked in the AFOAI's Defense Air branch (AFOAI-DA) and the Air Estimates branch (AFOA I-AE). All of these men became know n as \"violently anti-UFO.\" Researchers can grasp a clear insi ght into why some people became \"pro-UFO,\" or on the other hand how someone may choose to discount the sightings . But no one can explain the motivation behind that Pentagon faction which chose to debunk the phenomenon at all costs. Officers like Colonel Harold Watson, (a key man on McDonald's staff) went so far as to criticize the character of pilots who saw UFOs. He even did this publicly and went out of his way to talk to reporters about the silliness of UFOs and those who claimed to have seen them. Yet all who were associated with Watson knew him to be the first to defend Air Fo rce pilots in any other matter. He was an outstanding officer—no one ever said anything to the contrary. In his early days he had also been a highly respected test pilot at Wr ight Field. During the war he di stinguished himself as head of Operation Lusty—an endeavor to recover German aircraft technology. The small group of men he lead around Europe during that mission became know n as Watson's Wizards and they all had great admiration for their commander. Watson would replace McCoy in mid 1949 as head of Intelligence in Dayton. His arrival, in fact, came just after the end of Project Sign and the creation of a very ineffective successor project called Grudge. He served that post until the creation of a reorganized UFO investigation in September of 1951 when Colonel Frank Dunn replaced him. During Watson's tenure at Dayton he, in association with James Rodgers, used Project Grudge to deb unk UFO sightings. Ironically, Watson would return"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"to head up Intelligence in 124 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying saucer Wave of 1947 Dayton in 1953 just as the heyday of Project Blue Book, under the ve ry objective administration of Captain Edward Ruppelt, came to an end. Other \"saucer killers\" were Pentagon assistants to the Director of Estimate, Major Aaron Jerry Boggs and Colonel JJ. Porter. Both Boggs and Port er (Porter soon became Director of Estimates) and especially Watson would affect UFO policy up through 1951, with Porter staying on the crusade through 1952. Yet these were not poor officers nor me n who lent themselves to anything other than objectivity. They were some of the best minds in th eir field, but they held more senior positions than the pro-UFO faction. Thus, many researchers ha ve wondered if there is a secret, yet unknown, reason for their unexplainable aggr essive hatred of the UFO phenomenon. Some researchers feel they may have had first-hand knowledge and involvement in a cover-up of physical evidence stemming from the Roswell Incident, although this idea has not been documented and remains only speculative conjecture at this point in time. As the Air Materiel Command at the ne wly renamed Wright-Patters on AFB complex in Dayton became involved in UFO research, factions formed th ere as well. The head of the AMC at this time was Lieutenant General Nathan F. Twining. Under his office came five basic operations. The most well known were the Air Force's Technical Research and Development engineering operation or T-3, and the Technical Intelligence group or T-2—whi ch became the Technical Intelligence Division (TID) in August. T-3 was based at Wright Field, comprising the aviation laboratories and headed up by Major General Alden Crawford with General P.O. Carroll serving as director of research and development (often termed R&D). That is where Loedding first worked (in building 11A Room 252) until assisting almost full time at T-2 by 1947. The T-2 offices, however, were located at Patterson Field—five miles away from the older Wright Fi eld. (The other divisi ons of AMC were T-l— personnel, T-4—supply, and T-5—plans.) Colonel Howard McCoy served as th e director of AMC's T-2/TID group. It had four subdivisions: Collection, Intelligence Analysis, Ai r Documents, and Photographic. Known as Mac, Colonel McCoy was an outstanding e ngineer in his own right. He had initially moved from a T-3 engineering division during the war into intellig ence work when men with his experience were needed to recover Germany's advanced aviati on technology. McCoy then got into the role of analyzing German technical documents which led his division into a general enemy air power analysis mission. That is how th e Intelligence Analysis division formed under TID's WWII era predecessor which was called the Material Comma nd Intelligence or MCI of the Air Technical Service Command—forerunner to AMC. Analysis is where Colonel Cl ingerman comes into the picture. He Chapter Six---The Birth of Project Sign 125 served as executive officer of MCI—Analysis by 1947. It was his office that Alfred Loedding assisted with at almost every level but concentr ating on supervising the o ffices of Guided Missiles and Foreign Industrial Fa cilities. Loedding worked well with Patterson Field Intelligence legends McCoy and Clingerman—who were both engineers at heart. But interesti ngly, Loedding seems to"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"have kept his Wright Field office in building 11A throughout 1947 and part of 1948 even though his title changed to Analysis Division Technical Assistan t of the TID intelligence department as early as 1946. Although the WWII era prefix MC IA was still used for a long time for TID's Analysis division, it was composed of two sections. One b ecame known as the Operations Section or MCIAO and the other as Technical Analysis Section or MCIAT. MCIAT had a number of branches like Special Analysis—MCIAXB, where Nicholas Post worked. Another was Special Projects—MCIAXO, headed by Major Raymond Llewellyn. A third was Foreign Liaison—MCIAXL. Then Aircraft and Guided Missiles \\ Analysis—MCIAXA, where John Zell and Lawrence Truettner resided. Special Projects or MC IAXO actually became the birth crad le of Sign because that is where innovative ad hoc committees formed. Alfred Loeddi ng, in fact, may have lobbied for such a special (UFO) project out of the Special Projects group before authorization even came down from the Pentagon. But, because all these offices were ve ry fluid, one can now see why the Sign team all formed from different areas with in the vast TID organization. It is still the personal opinion of these auth ors that Loedding inspired the project name of SIGN. After all, Edward Ruppelt once stated that each project name had a meaning behind it, and Loedding did come to believe that the discs co uld be of extraterrestrial origin. 10 As stated, Alfred Loedding, who worked in all the offices at one time or another—sometimes simultaneously, had a particular enthusiasm for the phenomenon. This may have b een generated by his own sighting during October of 1932. Primarily, however, his experiences during 1947 proved to Loedding that something very significant was taking place. Fortunately, the authors re cently tracked down a son and the br other of Sign civilian team leader Alfred C. Loedding. In two differe nt interviews with a follow-up in tensive interview of son Donald Loedding by Wendy Connors and then a third sess ion with both Hall and Connors present, these gentlemen detailed facts never before known about Alfred C. Loedding or the Sign project. Aside from the relevant UFO-related stories, the authors learned that Alfred Loedding had indeed been an extremely gifted aeronautical engineer. 126 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying saucer Wave of 1947 This is a very critical point because UFO debun kers have always downplayed the Sign project by continually focusing on one point—the inexperien ce of the team members. Research conducted by the authors finally dispels this myth. 11 The best information from Loedding's Project Sign days comes from his son Donald. Donald was in the transition from grade school to high school in those years and recalls numerous impressions from the time. One of the most stunning is a clea r memory of his father talking about \"landing cases,\" yet today the Project Sign documents releas ed through the Blue Book Files by the National Archives do not include any inve stigative paperwork on true unexpl ained landing incidents. Donald, however, recalls not one but numerous trips his fath er made to investigate such events including incidents in which UFOs interfered with the elec trical systems of automobiles. Such cases of electrical magnetic effects were not officially documented by Air Force investigations until 1957. Could this be why Alfred was the first to exam ine an electromagnetic connection to the phenomena while others only concentrated on ra m jet or nuclear propulsion theori es? He also reca lls his father being especially interested in UF O reports filed by airline pilots. The Sign files do speak of such cases but detail far fewer incidents than are re membered to have attracted Alfred Loedding's attention. On the other hand, unlike many of the sens ational stories currently in print on the Roswell"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Incident, Donald Loeding emphatically states that his father (who had a \"Secret\"—later \"Top Secret\"—security clearance) never spoke of any such event and is certa in that his father would have known about a crash of a UFO if it had occurred. His brother Fred confirmed that. In Fred's mind, Alfred had no knowledge of a UFO crash at Rosw ell. Fred Loedding does, however, tell a now rather familiar story about a hanger that was off bounds when visiting his br other at Wright Field around 1947 or 1948. Alfred could not tell Fred what wa s in that hanger because he himself had no access, but the implication was that is was UFO related. 12 Loedding, like all the Si gn members were the highest valued experts employed by the Air Force. By the end of 1948 the Sneider/Loedding team l ooked into 243 sightings with a high degree of care. 13 Unlike later Air Force investigations, partic ipating intelligence offi cers and Pentagon brass alike took this project very seriously. FBI agents continued to be uti lized to research the backgrounds of witnesses. Ohio St ate University, under c ontract with the AMC, also served as a resource. That's how the late Dr. J. Alien Hynek came to work as a consultant. In 1947 he taught astronomy at Ohio State. He was the only astronome r near Dayton and in later years described his long association with the Air Force as an accident of geography. Members Chapter Six---The Birth of Project Sign 127 of the Scientific Advisory Board to the Chief of Staff of the USAF like Dr. George E. Valley supplied their services as well in a consulting capacity. 14 Although no one knew what they might find, their interest primarily cente red around fears that the Soviets mi ght be responsible for the disc mystery. 15 14 October UFO activity in the fall of 1947 remained very spotty although intere sting reports continued to be documented. One such case marked unidentified, occurred eleven miles north of Cave Creek, Arizona, when two Phoenix mine operators saw a black flying-wing shaped UFO around noon that day. It zoomed over them at about 8,000 to 10,000 feet, moving around 350 miles per hour. Both men had experience with military aircraft, one with fi ve years service as a fighter pilot and the other with two years training as an Army Air Force gu nner and a pilot himself —yet neither could even make a guess as to what it was that they had seen. 16 On that same day Captain Charles E. Y eager broke the sound barrier and reached 760.5 miles per hour in the Bell XS-1. Until then only captured V-2 missiles flew at such speeds. Conventional jets could seldom exceed 600 miles per hour, and the German rocket designs only flew in restricted test areas of the American West and regions of Soviet Siberia. The next generation of rockets like Sputnik, that were capable of intercontinental flight or orbiting the Earth, were still a decade away. 12 November Boise, Idaho Statesman, reporter Dave Johnson c ontinued to express grea t interest in UFOs. Whenever a good case came along he c onscientiously sought to gather th e facts. This excerpt details a notable sighting from this date that took place off the American West Coast. Observations of unidentified aircraft at sea alwa ys attracted the attention of Intelligence officials due to the possibility that they could originat e from Soviet submarines. For that reason a clipping of this article ended up in the files of the 4th Air Force: (Alfred Loedding indicat ed in an interview in 1954 that"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Wright Field was keeping a similar file of co rrespondence and clippings in the late 40s, but unfortunately this material was apparently later disposed of.) 17 128 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying saucer Wave of 1947 Talks About Aviation by Dave Johnson One of the greatest aeronautical mysteries of all time—that of the flying discs—has come to life again. Objects which where reported seen by thousands of persons on the ground and by scores of pilots in the air, have been sighted off the Pacific coast. The oceanic appearance of flying discs was the subject of a message transmitted to naval intelligence in San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle. The report also was relayed to the U.S. hydrographic office in .\"..\" San Francisco. It originated with the se cond officer of the tanker S.S. Ticonderoga. The tanker was at a position 300 miles north of San Francisco, and 25 miles off the coast on Nov. 12 when the officer reported that he saw two flying discs. This is the report: \"Two flying discs were sigh ted flying southwest at f hi gh speed. They appeared about 36 feet in diameter and were 20 feet apart. They emitted a very bright glow and left a streak about 50 feet behind them. They were first sighted bearing north and di sappeared bearing west at 0620 Greenwich central time. The fix (position of the vessel) was latitude 43 deg rees 15 minutes north and 124 degrees 54 minutes west\" After receiving a report that the discs had been sighted at sea, we telephoned an intelligence officer assigned to one of the air forces in the United States. This air force had received \"orders from the top\" to expand every effort in tracki ng down the possible source of flying disc s. We cannot give this officer's name. But he said he is now convinced th at something has been flying over th e United States, and the source of that something, as far as he understands, is not known either to the Army or the Navy. We have also learned that the Army has asked what it considers its most cre ditable witnesses of flying discs to draw pictures of what they saw. These draw ings have all been generally the same. These sketches are of an object with a rounded nose and a tail with a sharp point, much like a tadpole. The officer with whom we talked appeared extremely interested in th e blue light which glared over a 250-mile area of southern Idaho and eastern Oregon a few weeks ago. He said he was not convinced it was a meteoric display. Three men, two United Airlin es pilots and a CAA air center insp ector riding with them, observed this light from a point near Baker, Ore. They said that after the light expi red there was a trail of luminescent particles in the air which slowly as sumed an arch of 180 degrees and vanished. 18 15 November It is hard to find detailed in formation on UFO sightings in foreign countries during 1947. Many of the accounts we do have are very vague. But whatever Chapter Six---The Birth of Project Sign 129 it was that this report represented—47,000 people at a baseball game in Managua, Nicaragua, saw it. Most of the stories described two silver oscillating \"platillos vala dores\" that slowly flew down over the stadium and briefly hovered before zooming off at terrific speed. Spanish for flying saucers, platillos valadores or \"flying plat es\" could only be so characteriz ed by people throughout the world because they resembled no known aircraft. 19"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"18 November By November there were efforts by the Air Force to plot the trajectory of UFO activity in North America based on the sightings that they had then collected—which only amount ed to about three to five percent of known incidents. Alfred Loedding and Pentagon cons ultant Dr. Charles Carroll seem to have coordinated on this but only one record speaks to this effort. 20 Because the files from this time are so sparse, only bits and pieces of the types of discussions going on at Wright Field can be ascertained in regard to UFOs. One curious topic we know of did center around Spain. Colonel McCoy remained very interested in any possibl e link to German technology that could account for the saucer sightings and conti nued to leave no stone unturned. One theory centered around the possibility that some German scientists had es caped to Spain at the end of the war and were developing radical aircraft desi gns. Today we know the Spanish were producing aircraft based on German designs, but these all dated back to pre- war or WWII models. In fact one of these many aircraft built in Spanish aircraft plants, a virtual copy of a German JU-52 transport, is today on display at the Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio. Yet, it is curious to note that at the end of 1947 Colonel McCoy sent a memorandum asking that all re ferences to aircraft development in Spain be upgraded to \"Secret.\" No files on this subject postdating that memo have been declassified. 21 (This notion of Spain serving as a point of origin fo r flying saucers gained public attention after a syndicated newspaper story, written by Lionel Shap iro, detailing weapons development in Spain.) Added to the mysteries of this time is a story out of Greece where numerous flying disc reports originated at the end of 1947. The Greek governme nt became very concerned over the incidents because of recent Soviet attempts to promote political instability as well as coerce democratic 130 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying saucer Wave of 1947 movements in the region. Greek au thorities thus decided to conduct an investigation. They assigned their top physicist, Paul Santorini, to the case. Santorini was a brilli ant scientist and a close friend of Dr. Albert Einstein. Santorini looke d into the possibility that the si ghtings could be the result of Russian missiles or aircraft. It was common knowledge th at the Soviets were seeking to influence the political situation in Greece, a nd this stood as a perfectly logical conclusion. Santorini, however, established that the reports were not attributed to known mechanical devices. Logically one would think that the American military would have been very interested in any such studies so near the Soviet border dealing with even the possibi lity of Russian missile activity. For that reason it is very odd th at the Pentagon instructed the Greek government to terminate Santorini's studies when they recei ved word of his conclusions. A team of American scientists then flew to Greece to interview Santorini, but no records have been uncove red to shed any more light on this unique series of developments. 22 It is interesting to specula te weather Alfred Loedding and missile expert Lawrence Truettner might have been on that trip to Greece. It certainly would have dovetailed with their duties as me mbers of the Analysis division. UFO activity overseas must have been rather significant that late fall and winter. As stated, less than five percent of sightings were reported to the US military in 1947, and only a percentage made news stories after the summer onslaught. So the sightings we do know of from Europe and the Middle East at that time suggest more than may be presently recorded. Thes e include disc sightings in the Persian Gulf on November 5th, Oslo, Norway, on December 12th, the Antarctic around the very end of 1947 or early 1948, and reports in Finland by the first of 1948. 23 Colonel McCoy was not the only one still trying to link disc sightings to European or Soviet"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"matters. By December the public was just as anxious to find out if there could somehow be a Soviet connection to the saucer mystery. Oregon Congressm an Harris Ellsworth even made the statement that, \"he had received information concerning the development of high-velocity missiles by Soviet scientists.\" 24 The implication expressed by Ellsworth's st atement attempted to address fears over the hundreds of unexplained sightings of discs that ha d occurred in his state since early summer. Scientists were also serious about the subj ect even though most did not speak out on the topic. Dr. D.C Wylie of the University of Iowa stood out as an exception. At the annual winter meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Wylie addressed a session attended by astronomers, urging that a nationwid e \"sky-patrol\" be established to Chapter Six---The Birth of Project Sign 131 investigate the flying disc phenomena. He, like other scientists, felt that the disc mystery may involve matters of national secu rity. His concern therefore ste mmed from a sense for national preparedness and not necessarily matters of scientific curiosity. This is an important point because it demonstrates that even by late 1947 the public in large part perceived flyi ng saucers as earth-born phenomena. In later years scientists would become interested in UFOs because of the implication to extraterrestrial visitation. By then, however, those same scientists w ould remain hesitant to speak out on the subject. This time it was not for reasons of indi fference but fear of ridicu le. Over the course of the years following 1947, the concept of spaceships from another world would be lightheartedly addressed by the press and after 1948 even by the Air Force itself. Largely becau se of that treatment, by 1949, the cinema and popular literat ure would equate UFOs not only with spaceships but do so in a negative stereotypical fashion which pr omoted that very air of ridicule. 18 December Because UFO sightings were still popping up in the news, the Air Force continued to feel public pressure for answers to the flying saucer mystery. The degree of pressure the government was then exerting on the USAF is not yet fully documented, but for some reason Air Force Chief of Staff, General Carl Spaatz, chose to comment on the issue th is day. He stated that he was not convinced of the existence of such objects but then contradicted his position by stressing that the Air Force could not discard the possibility that the saucers were the result of foreign technology. Obviously, reporters took this reference to be synonymous with Soviet ai rcraft. But did he have a different inference in the back of his head? Others like Loedding, were ju st starting to seriously consider spacecraft from other worlds as a possible answer. Although the military did important prelim inary investigations in 1947, many of the files it generated were mysteriously \"lost.\" What remain today are listed in the first cases of the United States Air Force Blue Book files. Edward J. R uppelt, later an Air Force project leader of UFO investigations from 1951 to 1953, ha d the opportunity to view a more complete set of files in late 1950. Fortunately, he summarizes many of hi s observations in his 1956 book, Report on Unidentified Flying Objects. His personal papers, now under the capable administration of Professor Michael Swords of the Department of Science at Western Michigan University, also reveal unique insights. Ruppelt stated that the 1947-48 corresponde nce of TID showed \"that the UFO situation was considered to be serious, in fact , very serious.\" Only the best in intelligence came together to work on Sign. As a result, security became very strict c oncerning media investigations into the subject as the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 132 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying saucer Wave of 1947 Pentagon did not know if UFOs were Soviet secr et weapons, the Navy XF-5 -U-l project, or \"non- earthly\" in origin. He confirms many at TID began to regard UF Os as the latter. By 1948 \"the Soviets were practically eliminat ed as a UFO source . ...those in ATIC were openly discussing the possibility of interplanetary vi sitors without others tapping their heads or looking smug.\" (When Ruppelt refers to ATIC, he means TID which in 1951 was renamed Air Technical Intelligence Center.) Ruppelt also found a memo in the old Project Sign files which, in his words, stated, \"Those who were convinced that UFOs were of Soviet origin now began to eye outer space, not because there was any evidence that UFOs did come from outer sp ace but because they were convinced that UFOs existed and only some unknown race with a highly developed state of technology could build such vehicles.\" 25 By the end of the year, 109 case reports of strange flying objects were accounted for in the Project Sign office. Nine cases still remain classifi ed as unidentified in toda y's declassified (Project Blue Book) Air Force files. 26 (Earlier Air Force fi gures listed 12 unidentifie d cases for 1947, but the index released by the National Arch ives in 1976 reveal only 9. In addition, the Air Force's official statistics from 1969 list 122 total reports for 194 7 but today only 108 cases plus an unnumbered report are present.) Dr. James McDonald, a noted UFO research er during the 1960s, reinve stigated many of the 1947 cases. He acquired names of witnesses from th e Air Force and tracked down some of those individuals. McDonald's papers, now available to serious researcher s at the University of Arizona, prove the 1947 wave was not just a \"fly over\" ph enomenon as often suggested. Rather, the sightings from that year reflect all aspects of UFO behavior as evidenced by later wave s. Other scholars in the field of UFO studies such as Ted Bloecher, Ai me Michel, Richard Hall , Jan Aldrich, and Loren Gross have concurred with McDonald. At one time or another in their writings they have stated that all aspects of the phenomenon are exemplified by the 1947 sightings with the exception of abduction cases. This even includes radar cases. Recent research by Jan Aldrich indicates that the first 1947 radar case may have occurred as early as January 16th over the North Sea. The Far East Air Force had three such cases in Japan during July, August, and September. The Humble Oil Company also had an anomalous radar incident at their research facility near Houston, Texas, on September 19th. To date, Jan Aldrich is continuing his very important research into 1947 and is the most qualified to draw the final conclusions on the great UFO wave of 1947. 1.

Conclusion 1948 The Short Heyday of Sign The year following 1947 witnessed the formal activ ation of Project Sign. Unfortunately the heyday of Sign lasted but a brief period. Four specific case investigations during 1948 tell a great deal of the story of Alfred Loedding and his beloved Sign project. In fact, if ever there was a time in which a group of highly technical people so ught answers to the complex UFO mystery, it was during that watershed period. In that year Loedding, Sneider, and other team members were literally looking for a sign to explain the events which had transpired during the past year—something to help explain the perplexing sightings of unusual aerial phenomena that were still occurring. On January 7th, 1948, they thought they had one. On that day Kentucky Air National Guard pilot Captain Thomas F. Mantell, Jr. died when his F- 51 fighter crashed southwest of Franklin, Kentucky, after intercepting a high flying UFO. Soon known as the Mantell Incident , the case is considered one of the most famous flying saucer stories of all time. The fateful intercept began at 2:30 P.M. CST near Louisville afte r personnel of Fort Knox's Godman Air Field became concerned over the presence of a strange object overhead. It had been in sight since 1:45 P.M. when tower operator Serg eant Quinton Blackwell re ceived a call alerting him to the UFO by the fort's security police. Tower commander Colonel Guy F. Hix later confirmed an"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"unknown over the area along with Captain Gary Carter, also in the tower at the time. Carter, with the aid of 6 x 50 field glasses, desc ribed it as a round white object wh ich appeared very high and at times seemed to hover. PFC Stanley Oliver, also in the tower, described the UFO more akin to a high altitude balloon, stating that it looked like \"an ice cream cone topped with red.\" Others had a similar description, likening it to a \"parachute w ith the bright sun shining on top of the silk.\" 1 Hix really didn't know what to think but decided he would try to find 134 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 out. About that time just such a means came to hi s disposal when Mantell' s flight of four F-51 fighters neared Louisville on a return ferry mission from Marietta Air Base in Georgia. Hix asked the group to pursue and identify, al though, one of the planes was runni ng low on fuel so continued on to the flight's planned destination at Standi ford AFB in northern Kentucky. The remaining three F-5 Is then began climbing as Mantell took the lead. At 2:45 P.M. Mantell gain ed visual contact with the UFO—stating that it was \"in si ght above and [a]head of me, and it appears to be moving at about half my speed or approximately 180 miles per hour.\" Already over 10,000 feet, Mantell led his flight still higher despite the fact th ey had no oxygen on board. Even as th ey approached the danger level of 15,000 feet, where no pilot is advised to fly without oxygen, Mantell pursued the UFO. He then reported: \"It appears to be a metallic object or possi bly a reflection of sun from a metallic object, and it is of tremendous size.\" Abruptly ba nking right, he continued his climb. At 16,000 feet Mantell's right wingman, 1st Lieutenant Albert Clements,' tried to match the maneuver but started to fall be hind. His other wingman, 2nd Lieute nant B.A. Hammond, also fell behind, becoming very concerned about their altitude . By that point they were over Bowling Green at 20,000 feet with Clements and Hammond quite a bit behind Mantell. The two wingmen had not yet seen the object nor were they even sure of what they were l ooking for. Mantell then radioed to them: \"Look, there it is out there at 12 o'clock!\" Clements could only \"discern a bright-appearing object, very small, and so far away [that I was] una ble to identify it as to size, shape, color ... Its position was slightly lower and to the left of the sun.\" Clements then urged his leader to level off and try to catch up with it from below. Mantell ignored the advice and radioed back that he wanted to follow it up to 25,000 feet for ten minutes and if he didn't get any closer, would then abandon the chase. Mantell then called Godman Tower around 3:15 P.M., stating: \"I'm still climbing, the object is above and ahead of me moving at about my speed or faster. I'm going to close in for a better look.\" Those were the last words ever heard fr om Mantell. The two other planes had broken off at 22,500 feet and headed for Standiford. All they could see as they left was th eir flight leader above them in the sun, still stubbornly climbing highe r. At around 25,000 feet heading south, Mantell had pushed his luck still further but lost. He blacked out from oxygen deprivation at about 3:17 P.M. as his plane continued to climb to 30,000 feet. At that altitude the aircraft lumbered over and entered a circling descent. Soon the plane began an uncorrectable looping power dive, breaking up between 20,000 and 10,000 feet. Mantell must have regained consciousness sometime before the crash because throttle, mixture, and prop-pitch were all altered to slow the aircraft. Unfortunately that attempt only served to over-stress the aircraft and may Conclusion---1948. The Short Heyday of Sign 135"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" have caused its actual breakup. 2 The aircraft crashed on the William J. Phillips farm outside Frankl in, Kentucky, just 750 feet from the owner's house. Mantell's body was partially de capitated yet still inside the aircraft. It was not burned, radioactive, nor ridd led with bullets as later se nsationalized accounts claimed. 3 His watch, however, had stopped at 3:18 P.M., a minute or so before the aircraft had hit the ground. Godman Tower did not observe Mantell's crash, but kept sight of the UFO until 3:50 P.M., more than two hours since the sighting began. By that time Clements had refueled at Standiford and returned to the area but di d not see anything unusual. This now famous UFO case had actually begun earlier that day at 1:15 P.M. when state police received civilian report s of an odd flying object over Maysville, Kentucky (80 miles to the east of Louisville). Their report initiall y put Fort Knox police on alert whic h in turn placed Godman Tower on the lookout for a UFO. But unexplainably another sighting came at 1:35 P.M. west of Louisville and Godman Tower near Owensboro and Irvington. This report described a ci rcular object about 250 to 300 feet in diameter. If correct, the UFO should have already passed the north edge of Godman field prior to their firs t sighting at 1:45 P.M. 4 That night more than a dozen AFB cont rol towers around the Midw est reported UFOs \"low on the horizon.\" The first sighting came from the Clin ton County Air Base near Wilmington, Ohio, at 7:35 P.M. EST. There, officers described seeing a lig ht that seemed to be \"dancing\" up and down as it changed color from red to green. It then abruptly left to the southwest with a trailing exhaust. Then, just to the southwest of Clinton near Colu mbus's Lockbourne Air Base, tower operators saw a brilliant light descend as it traile d an amber-colored exhaust. App earing perfectly spherical or orb- like, the object proceeded to make three tight ci rcling maneuvers as it passed over the entire base. The light next streaked up at tremendous velocity to abruptly stop at a stationary position below an overcast sky. Yet, it soon rapidly descended strai ght back down. Coming mu ch closer to the ground, the orb hovered for ten seconds—only to rise strai ght back up once again. The mysterious light returned to a spot just below the clou ds before it sped off to the northwest. 5 The Air Force publicly blamed the planet Ve nus as the cause for all of the series of sightings, including the daylight inci dent in Kentucky. In actuality, however, many of the intelligence officers in TID's Sign project were slowly becoming convinced UFOs were extraterrest rial in origin during 136 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 the course of the long accident investigation that continued thr ough April. Loedding and Sneider got the Venus idea from Dr. Hynek w ho had only offhandedly suggested the planet as one possible explanation. They, however, used it as a cover or a quick fix to explain away what, at the time, became a very widely publicized incident in th e midst of what was obvi ously going to be a long investigation. Sign team members thought they might have to suggest a far more shocking conclusion, but not before they had the time to develop the theory. Edward Ruppelt, head of a later UFO i nvestigation named Project Blue Book, confirmed as much in his memoirs. He stated that many at TID had adopted the \"interplanetary\" option by the end of the investigation because all others were exhausted. For that reason the Sign staff, in Ruppelt's opinion, looked only for evidence suggesting \"spaceshi ps\" and nothing else in the Mantell case. Not finding any, they stuck to the Venus excuse to k eep it under wraps. A sighting of the planet Venus would serve that purpose as well as any, but in their haste they did not even bother to check to see if Venus would have been bright enough to have been visible by Mantell or Godman Tower. Asking that question to Dr. Hynek in 1951 wh en Edward Ruppelt headed a reinvestigation of the"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"case, they discovered that Venus would have been too dim to have been seen on the afternoon of January 7th. Ruppelt then discovered evidence suggesting that some or all of the Kentucky sightings could have been caused by a 100 foot diameter Navy \"skyhook\" research balloon released that morning at the Clinton County AFB in Ohio. Skyhooks were used for high altitude cosmic-ray research and were very secret at the time. He al so discovered that the wind currents that day were right to take a skyhook over Kentucky, yet the best evidence was still to come. In the files, he read about two observers who just hours after the Louisville incident sighted a balloon. Both individuals, one in Kentucky and the other in Tennessee, had init ially had their attention drawn skyward to what appeared to be a very unusual object to the naked eye, but then they easily identified it through their telescopes as a balloon. 6 It seemed the final proof, but de spite Ruppelt's discovery, the Air Force never officially backed down from its unplausi ble celestial explanation and has thus caused newspapers and magazines to continually sensationa lize the story. To this day the case's details are so distorted that it remains not only the most talked about of th e \"Classic cases,\" but the most confusing as well. Yet Ruppelt's theory, although quite plau sible, does leave seriou s questions unanswered. Mantell's last radio transmission clearly indica ted the UFO was out-pacing his 400 mile per hour F- 51. Skyhook balloons, even when caught in the jet stream cannot travel th at fast. Of course if it was a Conclusion---1948. The Short Heyday of Sign 137 skyhook, it could have been as high as 60,000 feet cau sing Mantell to only think it outperformed his fast plane when in actuality he was seeing some thing much higher and further away. That might explain why the object remained in view from Godman for over two hours. But Mantell did have 2,867 flying hours, 67 of them in the F-51. He was a very experienced flyer and a veteran of the Normandy Invasion—having also won a Distinguished Fl ying Medal. He was also then operating his own flying school. At 22,000 feet or higher could he not have recognized a high altitude balloon that should have resembled a cone-shaped object, much like ground observer PFC Oliver described? A close friend of Mantell went on record indicating that his friend had been a very cautious pilot and could not understand what would make him exceed the dangerous limit of 15,000 feet without oxygen. Even a flying cadet has the knowledge hamme red into him at an early point that no one under any circumstances endangers himself or his aircraft by going above 15,000 feet without oxygen. Mantell's fellow pilot stated: \"The only thing I can think was that he was after something that he believed to be more important than his life or family.\" 7"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" Thom as M antell Two other am azing but less well known cases cam e into TID during the long Mantell investigation that further influenced the Sign team 's opinion. One concerned a \"flying wing\" report from the Central Philippines. Filed by 1st Lieute nant Robert W. Meyers, the sighting took place on April 1st 1948 at 9:55 A .M. local tim e on a clear day with u nlim ited visibili ty as the experienced aviator led a flight of three P-47s of the 67th Fighter Group. Me yers was at 1,500 feet when he noticed the unusual craft three m iles east of his p osition. Sh aped like a flying wing or \"half-m oon\" with a \"turtle back,\" the object re sem bled nothing then in the Pacifi c. The strange craft flew below him at about 1,000 feet and travel ed around 200 m iles per hour. He estim ated its span to be 30 feet by 20 feet long, with an overall silv er color. Meyers attem pted to c ontact the other th ree aircraft in his group, but his radio went out. Finally, curiosity got the best of him , and Meyers decided to try to get a 138 Al fre d L oedding and The Great Fl ying Sauce r Wave of 19 47 better look. He m ade a 240 degree left turn, but as he did the UFO m ade a 90 degree left turn and leveled out to accelerate away at great speed in a m atter of onl y seconds. No sound, power units, landing gear, cockpit, or exhaust tr ails were detectable, but he did notice that the craft had a sm all dorsal fin. 8 Loedding, with his know ledge and expertise of flying wing de signs must have took a special interest in this case. He also ha d reports of Meyers reputation as a pilot. B y all accounts Meyers was a \"reliable, non-excitable indivi dual who appeared quite positiv e about his statem ents.\" This, coupled with the fact that the Northrop Flying Wi ng (the XB-35 and YB-49 m odels) were the only airc raf t any where in th e world tha t m et the char acte ristics of the cr aft he saw, m ade this a truly rem arkable sighting. 9 Because those aircraft nev er left the United States, the Sign team knew Meyers saw som ething of \"foreign origin.\" But by then even the dieh ards in the p roject were becom ing doubtful that such aircraft could be of Soviet constructi on. Loedding and a m ajority of the team therefore theo rized by that sp rin g that m any of the UFO i ncidents could possibly represent som ething from outside this world. 10"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" A report that strengthened their position came just four days later. It involved three trained balloon observers from the Geophysics Lab Section at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. On April 5th they and project leader J.W. Pe oples, were working on a secret project connected with the Air Force's Watson Laboratory field studies. In the middle of their tests th ey noticed a round white object with a golden hue fly very high over the base at \"tremendous speed.\" The third man then briefly caught sight of a second UFO. One of the men described what he saw as an irregularly rounded craft, slightly co ncave on top. The duration of the incident only spanned 30 seconds, but in that time the unknown made at least one vert ical loop and then di sappeared westward. Although the knowledgeable balloon men said the object looked a lot lik e a balloon, they were certain that it was not because three facts discounte d the possibility of a lighter-than-air object. First, its violent maneuvers surpassed the stress limits of any known balloon design then in use. Secondly, the high level winds up to 65,000 feet were measured th at day as coming from the west at only ten to fifteen miles per hour and no balloon flies agains t the wind. Finally, if high velocity winds were present, and they had blown from the east, a ballo on could not attain such speeds even if caught in strong winds. The only fact that likened it to a balloon was that at no time could sound be detected nor could their sensitive 400-meter atmospheric nois e receiver, then in operation, record any signal. 11 Conclusion---1948. The Short Heyday of Sign 139 Highly trained aerial observers such as these carry a lot of weight in a UFO investigation. Alfred Loedding and an assistant from Cli ngerman's office, Lieutenant Col onel J.C. Beam, went out to New Mexico to investigate the case in person. Unfortunately, when they arrived Peoples and the other witnesses were away on other duty, but they were interviewed later at Watson Labs in New Jersey. Loedding and Beam did talk to a Lieutena nt Markley while at Holloma n. Markley indicated that unusual radar returns had been noted at the base. He also told them of a sighting he had in August of 1947 and observations of \"flat, round aeroforms\"on two other occasions. (See page 109.) Loedding and Beam took advantage of their tr ip to investigate another older ca se. They traveled to Phoenix, Arizona, and interviewed William A. Rhodes who ha d captured a heel-shaped flying disc on film on July 7th, 1947. After Peoples and the or iginal observers in the Holloman incident were later interviewed at Watson Labs, investigators became personally convin ced that they had seen something that flew \"faster than any known object.\" Sign logged this case as the first of only seven unidentified sightings for 1948. Still very conservative with that desi gnation, even incidents like the flying wing report from the Philippines did not make the unidentified lis t. This shows that even the biased Sign team gave out unidentified ratings very sparingly and despite modern day claims were not so obsessed by the extraterrestrial hypothesis as to have it affect their objectivity. The fourth and most important event that shaped Sign's position came on July 24th when Eastern Airlines DC-3 Flight 576 took evas ive action at 2:45 A.M. EST to avoi d an air-to-air collision with a UFO! The frightened crew were at 5,000 feet and 20 miles sout hwest of Montgomery, Alabama, when the unknown flashed out of the northeast. It cam e as close as 700 feet to the right of their aircraft at a speed of at leas t 800 miles per hour but produced no propwash as a meteor might be expected to cause. The object th en pulled up and flew into some light, broken clouds at 6,000 feet. But barring those patchy clouds, it was a bright moonlit night. In fact, it was so clear that the pilots, Captain Clarence S. Chiles and First Officer John B. Whitted, had an exceptionally clear view of the UFO. They described it as a 100 foot long, wingless cylindrical-shape d object. The craft appeared to have a \"deep blue glow\" to the underside, with \"two rows of windows from which bright lights"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"glowed\" and a \"50 foot trail of orange red fl am e\" shooting out the back. One passenger on board, Clarence L. McKelvie, s aw the object and describ ed it as a \"strange, eerie streak of light, very intens e.\" 12 140 Al fre d L oedding and The Great Fl ying Sauce r Wave of 19 47 Quickly becom ing well-publicized, the now fam ous Chiles-W hitted Sighting rem ains one of the most notable of all UFO cases. In fact, right after the Eastern flight landed, the pilots reported the ir inciden t to the airline m anager. Eas tern then released the d etails of the sp ectacu lar ev ent to newspapers that day. F rom there the story hit th e national news, generati ng sensational headlines. These news accounts also reached th e Pentagon a nd the new Intelligence Chief Major General Charles P. Cabell. Cabell had Dayton on the phone imm ediately, ordering Col onel McCoy to initiate a prom pt investigation. B y the afternoon of the 25th McCoy had Alfred Loedding, Albert Deyarm ond, and Major Raym ond Llewellyn on an Ai r Force plane headed to Atlanta. Losing no tim e, the Sign team quickly had Chiles and W hitted under in terrogation o n the 26th at the Henry Grudy Hotel. Loedding and Deyarm ond questioned th e pilots over and over and becam e impressed by the consistency of their accounts. Loeddi ng and Deyarm ond also becam e impressed by the military se rvice of Chiles and W hitte d and in par ticula r Chile s' outstanding record in co mmercial aviation. In the m eanti me Llewellyn tracked down th e lone passenger who had also seen the object. He had not actually been able to observe m uch, only comm enting on the obj ect' s bright red-orange exhaust. A prelim inary report was then sent to th e Pentagon, and the team returned to Dayton m ore convinced than ever that som ething beyond human or igin had been responsible for this and other incidents. That is som ewhat iro nic becau se for what ever reason, th e \"pro-saucer\" Sign staff told the p ilots that the incident resu lted from a rare astronom ical even t kn own as a fireball. Chiles and W hitted, however, refused to accept the explanation and both pilots w ent public, m aintaining that they had seen a m anufactured craft of som e sort. These ske tche s depict the UFO seen by Chiles and Whi tted. It is si gni fican t to note tha t as the ye ars w ent by the Chiles -Whitte d Sigh ting rem ained an imp ressive case in the eye s of rese arche rs. One of the forem ost UFO inves tigators of all time, Dr . James McDonald, interviewed both of the pilo ts in t he 196 0s and st ated that he bec ame convinced of the fact th at they s aw cle arly de fined openings or window s on the cr aft that buz zed their plane that night. No one in fact e ver doubte d the credibilit y of Chiles or Whitted. Both men,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"for example, were describe d as \"utterly r eliable\" by famed pilot and Easter n Air lines president, Captain Eddie Ricke nbacker . Co nclusion ---19 48. Th e Sho rt Heyd ay of Si gn 141 Edward Ruppelt states in his m emoirs that re gardless of what that crew saw, the Sign officers were becoming convinced that UF Os were \"int erplanetary\" in origin. Captain Sneider seem ed to be another key advocate of that prop osal. Sneid er even attach ed a one-pag e report to the Chiles - Whitted f ile in which he argued th at a wingless r ocket-sh aped object cou ld be ae rody nam ically feasible.

After the Chiles-W hitted Sigh tin g, TID' s Sign team sponsored, apparently under Loedding' s sole authorsh ip, a class ified top secret docum ent for inter-service distri bution which traced the history of UFO investigations all the way back to the ghos t rocket s ightings of 1946. Like all su ch m ilitary evaluations involving a study up to a specific point in tim e, it received the term \"estim ate of the situation.\" The docum ent has now be com e fa mous for the term. Accord ing to Ruppelt, this Estim ate of the Situation reached a dram atic conclusion, stating that m any of the UFO sightings investigated by Project Sign m ay be \"interplanetary\" in origi n. Although the m ost startl ing part of the report advocated that the m ilitary should be put on an \"a lert footing\" in the wa ke of the unexplainable sighting s. 14 (That UFO alert was actually i ssued that fall by the Pentagon.) 15 Needless to say the re port drew considerable attention as it went up through the chain of command and passed by Air Force scientific advisors —a ll the way to Chief of Staff, General Hoyt Vandenberg. 142 Al fre d L oedding and The Great Fl ying Sauce r Wave of 19 47 "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" Vandenberg, however, refused to have it distri buted due to what he saw as a lack of any physical evidence to support their conclusion. He and other top brass were just not ready to go on record with such a fantastic position without hard proof—physical proof. And that was the one thing no Sign officer could provide no matter how hard he wi shed he could. Correspondence of this time shows Pentagon officials were also mi ndful of the panic caused by the radio broadcast The War of the Worlds on October 30, 1938. 16 Because of the panic gene rated from that incident, no general would have wanted to answer to the President if an Air Force pr ess release about UFOs had led to a similar disaster. Vandenberg, a decorated commander from WW II and a career military officer, intended to focus all of his efforts on organizing and building up the image of the new USAF. Even if UFOs were from another planet, Estimate conceded that they could not prove a di rect threat to national security, and thus the Pentagon chose a wait and see attitude. 17 Unfortunately, Vandenberg's official lack of interest in TID' s Estimate led to low morale among Project Sign staff. Despite a trip to the Penta gon by Sign team members Lawr ence Truettner, Albert Deyarmond, and Alfred Loedding to lobby for Estimat e, the Pentagon refused to be swayed into sanctioning the document. 18 No matter the significance of their conclusion, Sign could not share their opinions outside TID. 19 Only a handful of the thick, black-covere d, legal-sized Estimate repor ts were ever reproduced, and those were soon ordered burned. A few copies apparently survived up until 1951 when Ruppelt reviewed the intelligence files. He claimed that by that time the report had been declassified, but this is unlikely when one considers its conc lusions and the fact that no copy of Conclusion---1948. The Short Heyday of Sign 143 Estimate has ever surfaced. But, Ruppelt did claim to see the document with his own eyes. If any copies of Estimate survived beyond that point, th ey probably were taken as souvenirs along with some other early files known to have met that fa te. Today they may very well be collecting dust in someone's attic. Some researchers erroneously cl aim that Air Intelligence Report Number 100-203- 79, \"Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the Unite d States,\" a joint study by the USAF Directorate of Intelligence (DI) and the O ffice of Naval Intelligence (ONI ) approved on December 10, 1948, and declassified in March 5, 1985, is a modified version of Estimate. 20 Although the Navy sent a letter to the USAF in January of 1948 desiring to assist in the analysis of UFOs, their subsequent joint study superseded Estimate which was only an estimate of the situ ation up to the time that Sign submitted it. 21 Nevertheless, Air Intelligence Report Number 100-203-79 is an amazing document in its own right. It is so notable because it s main conclusion suggested that a number of UFO events had a high probability of being the result of Soviet activity. In fact, a later Blue Book officer, Dewey Fournet, urged that this document be kept classified because even in 1952 he and others (although open- minded to an extraterrestrial explanation) still fe lt that the Soviets may be responsible for many of the incidents. 22 This is of such significance because today, with the opening-up of former Soviet records, historians now know that the USSR never flew spy missions over the United States with aircraft or guided missiles. Dewey Fournet also made the statement that somewhere in the files awaiting declassification is a copy of Sign's Estimate. (He actually had a chance to see it as he did 100-203-79.) 23 It could be true. The National Archives has a nightmarish amount of former military files, some of which are no longer classified, but whose conten t has literally been lost because they are buried in virtual mountains of document clutter.

So many government documents have accumulated that some 100 million are still awaiting declassification from WWI alone. Others predating just 1960 number over a billion pages of material. Even making a brief study of thes e could take teams of re searchers a lifetime. Although Dr. Hynek confirmed in the 1970s that Estimate did exist as Ruppelt and Fournet claimed, Ruppelt's book is the only first hand account we have of the draft and merely teases us with a few of its points. 24 One interesting passage suggests that the Air Force had an interest in UFOs before 1947 and that the English ha d actually tracked some of the \"Ghost Rockets\" in 1946 on radar. 25 If so, this would contradict the Air Force's consistent refusal to this very day to recognize the phenomena's existence before June 24, 1947. Donald Loedding clearly remembers the c ontroversy surrounding the reje ction of his father's \"Estimate of the Situation\" draft to General Va ndenberg and the resulting deep disappointment by his father. Donald had the impression that Alfred Loedding, who had been a rising star at Wright Field, officially fell from favor as a result of his personal belief th at many of the flying disc sightings could represent craft of extraterrestrial origin. Wh en he personally authored that carefully reached conclusion in the \"Estimate\" draft, Loedding severely hurt his career. Researchers know that with the end of 1948 a drastic change took place in Project Sign. The great sense of importance that the Pentagon had pr eviously bestowed on the project suddenly ceased. Dropped almost overnight, it happened in the midst of one of the most unsettling series of UFO sightings over American military bases then to date. By mid-1949 the lead ers of the project like Sneider and Loedding would be ousted and, barri ng a period in the early 1950s, the AMC staff would never again openly talk about the origin of UFOs. Perhaps the extreme conclusions of the Estimate draft and the summary of the Project Sign final report (drawn up in late 1948 by Truettner and Deyarmond, and finished in February 1949) becam e just too much for the Pentagon to handle. Titled Unidentified Aerial Objects—Project Sign, a great deal can be interpreted by reading between the lines of the passages of that final report. Even the introductory passages are important because they use some very interesting phrases. In the Foreword, for example, the Rand study is men tioned along with the intent to explore the possibility that some observed Conclusion---1948. The Short Heyday of Sign 145 objects may represent \"spaceships\" or \"satellite vehicles.\" (On July 21st the Pentagon had ordered a study to be made by the Rand Corporati on to evaluate that possibility.) 26 This is stunning terminology regarding the Rand study because everyone who would have then read that report knew full well that not only did the United States not posse ss anything that could attain earth orbit, neither did the Soviets. In fact, it would be nine years before such an event occurred with Sputnik— considered much ahead of its time then. The Introduction of the Sign final report ha s another intriguing passage . In the second paragraph it clearly states that this report is not a final estim ate of the situation. This may very well have been a"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"way of stating that the Sign report was not able to draw the conclusions it did in Loedding's Estimate of the situation. Another sentence in the final report also seems to draw something from the earlier Estimate report when it speaks of assessing the possibility of a threat to na tional security presented by \"such large numbers of unidentified flyi ng objects.\" In the original Estim ate report, Dr. Hynek confirmed that the Sign team called for an official UFO alert to be proclaimed—somewhat as was actually issued late that fall. Therefore, although the Pe ntagon always outwardly i gnored the UFO situation by stating that no threat was pr esented to national security—the fear was clearly there. Aside from that, the sentence is also of note because for the first time the term unidentified flying object is used. The summary again uses that phras e and speaks of The Books of Charles Fort, which was one of the first works deta iling unusual aerial phenomena in earlier times. This is significant because officially the Air Force has always refu sed to recognize the UFO phenomenon before June of 1947. One wonders how much discussion of th is was present in the Estimate draft. Many more pages follow the introductory pa ges, including an appendix by James E. Lipp of the Rand Corporation that contained the conclusions of their contracted study. It actually considered the possibility that UFOs could originate from either Venus or Mars. (Prior to NASA's planetary probes in the 1960s and '70s even reputable scientists openly cons idered without ridicule the possibility that civilizations could exist in our own solar system.) Travel from other star systems, however, was considered improbable even then because Lipp's repor t stated that \"the actions attributed to the 'flying objects' reported during 1947 and 1948 seem inconsistent with space travel [because of the vast distances between stars].\" The report was released only to specific government and military offices as the ominous end of Sign came when the Air Force changed the 146 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 name of Project Sign to Project Gr udge at the request of the Director of Research and Development. Officially indexed as the \"Detai led Study of Flying Discs,\" Grudge marked a sudden attitude change in UFO investigations. That revised project bega n in 1949 by building a public relations campaign to downplay UFO sightings. 27 At the same time the elite of the TID intel ligence officers, almost all of which had gravitated to Project Sign, were on their way out. Ruppelt wrote that many in intelligence \"drastically and hurriedly changed their minds about UFOs when they thought the Pentagon was no longer sympathetic to the UFO cause.\" He stated that others who had not changed their minds were \"purged.\" Other officers who had ev en briefly considered the extrat errestrial hypothesis eventually found themselves replaced by new personnel. The Pe ntagon used Grudge to \"put an end to UFO reports\" by explaining every sightin g and telling the public just how the Air Force used expert investigation methods to reach their conclusions . This sudden change in policy was so pronounced that Ruppelt wondered if there was not some hi dden reason behind it. He wrote of an underlying feeling he had when taking over UFO investigations in 1951: This period of mind changing bothered me. Here were people deciding th at there was nothing to this UFO business right at a time when the reports seemed to be getting better—maybe I was just playing the front man to a big cover-up. I didn't like it because if somebody above me knew that UFOs were really spacecraft, I could make a big fool ou t of myself if the truth came out\" 28 Dr. Hynek also spoke of that period in his wr itings. He described this ch ange at TID as occurring virtually overnight. Donald Loeddi ng confirms that Alfred Loeddi ng was \"fired\" from Project Sign"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"by 1949 as a result of his position. Although he did re main in Dayton doing work for the Air Force until 1951, the pressure continued. Donald feels that officials at AMC attempte d to \"phase his father out\" as is often done in the corporate world. Records do show, in fact, that Al fred Loedding's efficiency rating reports went from excellent in 1948 to lower and lower grades until he resigned on February 16th, 1951. At that time Loedding secured a job as director of jet re search at Unexcelled Chemical Corporation in Cranbury, New Jersey. After Vandenberg's death in 1954, Alfred Loedding once again found the Air Force interested in his skills. In 1955 Loedding re turned to Dayton and Wright-Patterson AFB. By 1960 he was working out of Langley AFB in Virginia as the Air Force's liaison officer to NASA. The records indicate that he served only as a civilian consultant in that role, but the Conclusion---1948. The Short Heyday of Sign 147 implication posed by his family is that there may have been a connection with CIA headquarters at Langley. But from 1951 until his death in 1963, Loeddi ng, according to Donald, never again worked on or talked about UFOs—so deep was his disapp ointment and disgust with being \"fired\" from Project Sign for his views. Alfred C. Loedding was of strong German descent, ingrained with a high moral work ethic and dedication to family and country—the United States of America. When Loedding helped draft the Sign position on the extraterrestrial thesis, he did so with great thought and devotion. Vandenberg's rebuff severely hurt Loedding's pride. Also professi onally injured at the time by his views, Loedding never again became involved in UFO research. Another man may have compromised his stand, especially when it clearly affected his career for the worse. But Loedding was too dedicated and true to himself to be a \"yes man.\" Thus, the worst that can be said about Alfred Loedding is that he was not a diplomat as later Blue Book notables Edwa rd Ruppelt and Robert Friend were. As a result, Loedding's time in ufology was brief but very notable.29 1.

It is interesting to note that at the height of the UFO wave in the summer of 1947, Welles made a very amusing statement to the press: Orson Welles said today he'd bet 10 to one that the \"flying saucers\" will fizzle into fancy just like his \"invasion from Mars\" broadcast that fooled the nation in 1938. \"I want everybody to know that I didn't have anything to do with this saucer hoax,\" though.

Final Word There are a number of other very interesting sightings th at shed more light on the aftermath of the great UFO wave of 1947 and Alfred Loedding's in fluence on Project Sign. Two very intriguing reports from July 29th and 31st 1948 seem to suppor t Loedding's dramatic findings expressed in the Estimate draft. They come from Indianapolis, Indiana, and remain listed unidentified in Air Force files. The first sighting took place at 9:55 A.M. CST on the 29th when James Toney and Robert Huggins were driving near the wooded area of Fall Creek. Just after crossing the creek via a cantilever bridge, they neared the intersection of East 56t h Street and Fall Creek Boulevard. At that point Toney and Huggins observed a strange looking flying machine pass about 200 feet from them."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"It appeared to be of shiny aluminum construction moving at a slow speed of not more than 30 miles per hour as it flew about 30 feet above the tree to ps. The craft did not resemble anything the men had ever seen in the skies before, looking like a \"broad short propelle r\" or boomerang with \"cups\" on its upper sides. The object had a three to one ratio, a pproximately six to eight feet long by about two feet high. The strange machine made no noise as it then passed out of sight over the tree line. Sign extensively investigated the case with the initial field work being supervised by Colonel James A. Ronin, commander of the 331st AFB reserve training unit at Stout Fi eld near Indianapolis. They quickly determined it could not have been a g lider or aircraft. TID officers even wrote to the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York, in the belief it might have been the result of their roto-chute experimental vehicle, but found that it had never flown in that area of the country. When a very similar sighting took place in the city two days later, intelligence officers became even more interested. Mr. & Mrs. Vernon Swigert in the south central part of town witnessed this second event. The object they saw flew over at 8:25 A.M.. on the 31st. It appeared white and had the same general three to one proportional shape as in the earlier si ghting. Yet that object looked much more like the traditiona l flying saucer. This unknown craft resembled a \"cymbal,\" and moved silently by at very great speed. The two observers fe lt it may have traveled as fast as 1,800 miles per hour at a height of 2,000 feet. At no time did it deviate from a level flight path and left Final Word 149 no exhaust trail. 1 Because no other aircraft or balloons of any sort could be found to explain the Indianapolis Sightings, they were bot h marked unidentified. 2 Already self-conscious about having no proof to back up their Estimate conclusions, Sign officials like Loedding went to great le ngths to continue to run a very tight and professional investigation throughout the rest of the year. Unidentified listings were therefore stil l sparingly given. By August UFO incidents in the US, like thos e from Indianapolis, seemed to have peaked for the year just as rumors of disc si ghtings started to filter out of Ea stern Block countries and the far reaches of Asia. Most were strikingly similar to the disc reports in North America during 1947. Many of these, in fact, came from areas of the gl obe where the term \"flying saucer\" had never been heard. 3 Few of those foreign reports were evaluated by Sign, but an interes ting sighting from August 3, 1948, reached AMC's TID from, of all places, Moscow . This fact is significant because although a rash of UFO incidents occurred over Russia that year, it was also the hi gh point of the Berlin Airlift. Tensions between East and West were so strong that many expected a third world war might soon break out. Reports on UFO activity behind the Iron Curtain were therefore few and far between— accounts of which are only now becoming known. Thus somewhat of a curiosity among early in telligence personnel, primarily for its Cold War era location, this case is known as the Moscow Report. The file did not really represent an especially good account, being compiled only from the recollection of an undisclosed American newspaper reporter. His sighting took place about twenty miles northwest of the city at sunset when he and a Russian friend viewed a long narrow cigar-shaped object proceeding at a high but not excessive speed toward the northeast. No wings or stabilizers we re visible likening it to an aircraft or rocket, although the sunlight reflecting o ff its surface did suggest that th e craft had a metal skin. The reporter and his acquaintance both watched the sp ectacle as it passed by without making a sound. They agreed that the object looked like a rigid ai rship, so familiar to anyone who had lived through the great age of the large dirigibles in the 1920s and 1930s. Yet both also said it moved far too fast for a lighter-than-air craft. Neither had any idea wh at the strange object could have been, \"it might"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"have been anything the reporter himself 150 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 concludes.\" 4 Because the Air Force had no way to inves tigate such a sighting, this is the type of report often filed under the handy cat egory: \"insufficient data.\" Another type of classification used in th e Air Force files reads \"unr eliable.\" Unreliable became the conclusion of case number 198 because its wi tnesses were children. Case 198 is however a notable mystery in the Sign files. Not only is it one of very few reports describing a UFO landing, but also the size of the file seems unwarranted when taking in to account that the unreliable designation was given early on in th e investigation. Experience will tell any researcher that when so many pages are found on an Air Force UFO case, strong attention was given to it by someone. The incident involves two children ages ten and eight. They were playing in their backyard on a Hamel, Minnesota, farm on August 11, 1948, when they had their attention drawn skyward. Above them in the noontime sky the children noticed a du ll gray metallic craft descending downward. Each of them described it as two inverted plates stuck together which, in their words, then gently touched down with a \"clanking noise.\" It soon started maki ng a whistling noise and rose up to twenty feet, stopped and hovered, and then maneuvered over the tree tops and telephone lines before flying off. The first investigator on the scene was from the AMC and his immediate conclusion stated: \"This apparent bit of fantasy is hardly worth further consideration.\" 5 Such a designation, especially after funds were expended for travel out of Dayt on, always killed further investigation then and there. But despite that early conclusion, a large amount of attention was soon displayed on the case as evidenced from the correspondence. Soil sample s were collected and p hotos taken documenting the landing sight. Numerous government agencies including the FBI then re quested access to the samples. Usually only lieutenants and maybe a cap tain are involved in such an investigation, but correspondence in the files shows a Lieutenant Colonel Allison initiatin g a \"resurvey\" of the landing sight. This would seem to indicat e that at some point the initial investigation was overruled and a more detailed study ordered. Who decided such a si ghting with only children as observers warranted so much attention? Why did the FBI end up anal yzing the soil samples and not Wright-Patterson labs? Why does the FBI corres pondence show J. Edgar Hoover personally involved in the administration of the soil analysis? 6 Case 198 has plenty of questions to go around. A sighting from September 23rd that year from San Pablo, California, Final Word 151 stumped Air Force investigators su fficiently to label the case \"unidentified.\" It involved two highly respected witnesses, Sylvester Bentham and retired US Army Colonel Horace Eakins, who spotted a very odd-looking flying object around noon. Initially it attracted their attention not because of its amoeba-like shape, but speed—described once again as faster than that of any known aircraft. For over three minutes the attentive observers watched it tr averse due east in a stra ight line at a constant speed. They estimated that the object had to have been at least a mile a bove a low flying bomber then in view. The men, in fact, could not agree on the exact shape or dimension because it was so high. They did note that unlike the early jets of the time, it made no noise and left no exhaust. The Air Force ruled out an astronomical cause. They could only find a west-bo und United Airlines plane"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"as a possible solution yet felt this was highly unl ikely because it would have been moving in the opposite direction. 7 A much more well-known case became the third of the UFO Classics when North Dakota Air National Guard F-51 pilot George F. German had a very strange encounter while he attempted a nighttime landing into the Fargo airport at 9: 00 P.M. CST, October 1, 1948. German had just completed a crosscountry flight when on final appr oach his fighter passed within 1,000 yards of a sharply outlined orb. Described as a \"blinking light\" just inches in diameter and making \"remarkable revolutions,\" the experienced flyer had no idea what to make of it. German pursued the light repeatedly in order to identify, but after 27 minutes the object climbed out of sight. Because of a hair-raising series of intricat e maneuvers made during that intercept, this case has often been referred to as the German Dogfight. It's an apt title because during each of his persistent passes toward the light, the object rushed straight at the F-51. And each time German tried to turn around and pursue, he found it necessary to make an extensive series of turns, only to end up repeating the same scenario all over again. During the ordeal the light appeared to travel in excess of his own speed which ranged from 300 to 400 miles per hour yet produced no e xhaust trail nor sound. 8 Four other observers, including two pilots in a Piper Cub flying just below him, corroborated Gorman's story. The chief of the control tower also followed the event with binoculars. In fact, it was because the extraordinary encounter had so many good witnesses that the Air Force followed up with an extensive investigation. Sign/TID investigators Lawrence Truettner and Major Paul Lmbela flew to Fargo and headed up the case. Eyewitn ess accounts were checked and rechecked, and the plane itself was thoroughly gone ov er. Surprisingly, the aircraft's metal skin reveal ed radioactive exposure. To make sure, four separate Ge igers were used to confirm the readings. 152 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 It did sound like an excepti onal incident at the time, but the f acts soon pointed to some rather obvious solutions. The evidence suggested that the my sterious nocturnal orb might have merely been a small lighted weather balloon. Following other such incidents over the Caribbean, Intelligence found that when an aircraft approaches a lighted ba lloon at night, even an e xperienced pilot can have his perspective distorted. The ba lloon, in other words, appears to rush toward the plane when actually it is the plane rushing toward the balloon. Because the balloon is m oving so slowly, it is the aircraft that then makes the evasive action. When the aircraft attempts another pass, it has to make a complete 180 degree turn only to find itself rushi ng once again by the balloon so fast that the pilot can not identify it. Another lesson bestowed on general aviation from this would-be UFO case concerned the mysterious radiation. After furt her study, TID investigators discovered that any aircraft flying at high altitudes in the thin upper atmosphere is prone to absorb cosmic radioactivity. 9 This incident is now a standard in UFO lo re. This is puzzling because correspondence of the time shows Alfred Loedding, the most open minded to an extraterrestrial hypoth esis, writing a memo expressing caution in regard to over emphasizing the Gorman incident. Such insights were not, however, made public and over the years much specula tion has circulated in regard to this sighting. This is unfortunate because debunkers often seize on these sensat ionalized stories. When discussing the early history of UFO phenomena, they almost exclusively focus on classics like the Gorman Dogfight or the Mantel In cident. That's natural because thos e are the easy ones to explain. Most debunkers never even bother to research, let al one discuss, the other sight ings of the time. As a result, people are lead to believe that all of the early cases ha ve equally reasonable conclusions. When putting the event into historical perspective one unders tands this mind set. It must be"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"remembered that even by this date the Air Force had not yet released any ki nd of official report on UFOs and as a whole still hesitated to take a posi tion. Most of their investigations, even of such publicized incidents, were stamped \"RESTRICTED\" or \"SECRET\" and could not be disseminated to the general public until declassified. When the Blue Book Files were finally made public in 1976, few people bothered to research other cases from these early years—being so infatuated with the legends like the Gorman incident. While the Gorman Case has been discussed in almost every book published on UFOs, a much better sighting twelve days later ha s never been dealt with. It took place in South Bend, Indiana, on a clear and cloudless day Final Word 153 at 11:45 A.M. CST when two office workers sta nding at a window of the Studebaker Corporation observed a silvery flat disc-shaped object speed silently through the s ky at around 1,500 feet. The UFO appeared just a little smaller than a DC-3, although it moved about three times as fast. Both witnesses were uncertain if the craf t was spinning. They used th e description \"flashing\" because the sun's rays reflected from it just as br ightly as it would a chrome surface, thus at least giving the appearance of a rotating machine. Duri ng the brief eight to ten second sighting, the object came from the northwest on a straight southeasterl y heading. It flew with no visible means of propulsion, wings or rudders. Neith er observer had any idea of what they saw, but felt certain it could not have been a balloon or aircraft. Both office workers held important positions in the company's engineering department and were desc ribed by Studebaker management as being of \"a high type of caliber,\" and highly reliable. 10 It is the mass of this and many other obscure cases rather than just the three famous Classics that led Sign to its developing belief in extraterrestrial visitation. Loe dding, Sneider, Truettner, and even Deyarmond had to have been impressed by the repeat ed similarities of reported details among these many cases—especially when most of them were not known to the general public. 11 The single best sighting of 1948 and perhaps the best case then to da te is also overlooked, or perhaps overshadowed, by the so-called Classics. It was the first truly notable incident in which radar data combined with trained visual obser vation to produce a stunning UFO case. The initial report came into TID from Japan and involved a twin engine F-61 Black Widow night fighter from the 68th Fighter Squadron. While on patrol the ni ght of October 15, 1948, its crew had a very curious encounter at 11:05 P.M. local time. The incident occurred over the Fukuoka ar ea between the islands of Shigamo Shima and Fusae Shima on a clear and moonlit night when the F-61's radar detected an unknown object five miles away and below them at 2,305 feet. At the time of detection, radar clocked the UFO at a speed of 200 miles per hour. Curious as to what could be flying over a then occupied Japan, the pilot increased his speed to 220 miles per hour, deciding to close in for a visual confirmation. He guessed it would probably turn out to be an F-51 Mustan g fighter from another squadron but decided they could use the practice an yhow. He nosed down and approached within 12,000 feet of the would-be fighter but the unknown target then surprised him. It suddenly dived down under his F-61 in a \"split S\" maneuver, making a 180 degree turn and increas ing its speed to over 1,200 miles per hour (almost three times their own "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 154 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 speed). The UFO's burst of power appeared only temporary because the object soon slowed to its original velocity. By that point, however, both the pilot and his radar operator knew that their target could not possibly be an F-51, but they decided to try to find out just what it was that they were chasing. Attempting another intercept, the pilot again closed to a relative ly close distance merely to have the UFO go down and off at tremendous speed, slow ing only after putting about nine miles distance from their aircraft. Four more times the same scenario took place as if the strange machine was playing a game with them. Ground radar could no t confirm the presence of the UFO, although it tracked the F-61. Operators did say that because th e incident occurred at such a relatively low altitude, ground clutter interfered with surface-to-air tracking. Similar UFO intercepts would follow, yet this case stands out because the crew twice gained visual confirmation, thus excludi ng any possibility of a radar ma lfunction. The aircraft's radar operator, 2nd Lieutenant Barton Halter, had 300 hours logged in his position and became convinced they had encountered some new type of experiment al aircraft. The pilot, 1st Lieutenant Oliver Hemphill, had 900 hours flying time with 350 of those in combat in a B-17 over Europe. He stated that the UFO behaved much like the ME-163 German rocket planes did when attacking our bomber formations. But Hemphill stressed it did not look like a ME-163 nor any aircraft he had ever seen. In the Sign files there are pages and pages of reports and even a drawing of the object as seen by the pilot. The general de scription likened it to a \"rifle bullet,\" about 20 to 30 feet long with no discernible exhaust trail, flames, power plant, wings, stabilizers, fins, or crew canopy. Yet the UFO must have been real because Hemphill noted at one point that its silhouette was projected on the clouds by the full moon. In the investigation that follo wed, it was firmly establ ished that there were no other aircraft then in the area. Intelligence offi cers also learned that the weather conditions were good with five to six miles visibility, but that ev en with the moon there would not have been enough light for visual sightings at any great distance. Everyone at TID very much wanted to know what the F-61 crew saw that night in the dark skies over Japan, but no clues could be found. The case went down as the first unidentified in a special category called \"radar-visual.\" 12 A few Intelligence personnel, however, felt the October 15th incident over Japan could have repr esented an attempted intercept of a Soviet spy plane. It has only recently been discovered that Britain would soon fly nighttime reconnaissance missions over Russia, and America had overflights of Siberia as early as 1946 by way of the North Pole. The USAF also made Final Word 155 incursions into the eastern borders of the USSR throughout 1949. By 1956 the CIA would direct hundreds of deep penetration missions into Soviet territory with the famous U-2 spy plane. Some thought all along that the flying saucer reports were attributable to the Soviets conducting the same type of surveillance that we were doing to them, but only a few Project Sign cases seem to substantiate the claim. Following is a good exam ple of a report from November 4, 1948, that obviously represents a foreign spy plane: Unidentified aircraft observed at 10 43 14 Nov [sic] 1948 over Army Obs ervation Post #1 at 37O 57'N-125O 31'E, in South Korea, flying east to west at an altitude of 5000 feet. The same aircraft was sighted by army observation post #2 37O 51' N-125O 17' E, 4, 37O 57' N-125O 26' E and 5, 37O 56' N-125O 29'. Subject"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"aircraft circled observation post number 2, then headed north. Aircraft was twin engine bomber type, and is believed definitely to have been Soviet. 13 A second good radar-visual report followed the October 15th case. Th is time it occurred on the other side of the world in Germ any and involved an experienced F- 80 jet pilot of the 23rd Fighter Squadron stationed at the Furste nfeldbruck AFB. While out walki ng on the night of November 23rd, the Air Force captain observed fr om his base a reddish starlike object as it was simultaneously detected by ground radar. The crew in the radar station judged it to be at 27,000 feet traveling between 200-500 miles per hour. It then climbe d to 40,000 feet and circled 40 miles south of Munich. 14 Those are the basic facts present today in the Sign files, but when Edward Ruppelt described this incident in his 1956 book, he stated that radar ha d tracked the object at speeds up to 900 miles per hour and that they detected it climbing 23,000 feet in a matter of seconds! Those figures are not in the documents released by the National Archives in 1976. Though anyone who has read Ruppelt and has checked his facts with other fi les, knows that he was a stickler for details. This could not have been a simple mistake. What reports did he see that are no longer detailed in the declassified files? 15 If his facts are correct, it is a stunning admission because no man-made aircraft in 1948 could match that performance. Another mysterious noc turnal phenomenon known as Green Fireballs appeared in the New Mexico night skies during that November a nd December—seen by hundreds of witnesses up through 1949. After investigations by Project Sign and noted scientists like Dr. Edwa rd Teller and meteorite expert Dr. Lincoln La Paz, (who himself had observed these lights) no conclu sions were reached. La Paz, who had a UFO sighting in 1947, 156 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 became convinced they were not identif iable as a known astronomical activity. 16 The more La Paz studied the phenomenon the more he could be certain that they were not meteors. Unlike meteors, the fireballs flew n early horizontal at about 40,000 to 60,000 feet. And whereas almost all meteor impacts can be discovered from projecting th eir observed trajectory, no green fireball could ever be found to have hit the earth. La Paz even concluded that the green fi reballs were surely artificial objects and perhaps represented radio-controlled missiles. If true, they were not of domestic origin because the United States military didn't have a clue when the fireballs began to fly over the super-secret Sandia lab at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico where America's atom ic weapons were being built. Then the Hanford nuclear facility in Washington St ate had a sighting as well as the Los Alamos, New Mexico, nuclear research laboratory. Since these were the three most vita l facilities to nuclea r weapons production in the country, their administrators became frantic for answers and th e Air Force was the organization expected to provide them. 17 The USAF subsequently created a special study called Project Twinkle to investigate this new spin on the UFO phenomenon. It finally became a research project under th e Geophysics Research Division of the Air Force and ! the Cambridge Research Laboratory in February of 1950, more than a year after the largest number of sightings had ta ken place. Dr. Louis Elterman served as a central figure in the project. He contract ed with the Land Air Co. to pr ovide technical personnel during a scheduled period from April 1 to October 1, 1950, and from October 1, 1950, to March 31, 1951. But with the start of war in Korea on June 25, 1950, the project wound down. In the summer of 1951 Major Edward A. Doty took control, a nd by December Twinkle had closed down. 18"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" Ruppelt claims that Twi nkle was administratively formed earli er, in the late summer of 1949, when the green fireballs were still frequently being reported. 19 Twinkle then decided its best chance to document the phenomena would be through the us e of three special cinetheodolite (Askania) cameras. A cinetheodolite was basically a theodolite range finder with a m ovie camera attached. The trick with such a device is to get at least two or more cinetheodolites triangulated on the same object in order to determine altitude, speed and size. Th e Air Force, of course, with typical military bureaucracy initially allocated only one cineth eodolite to Twinkle and frequently moved it Final Word 157 so often to where sightings had already just oc curred that no one area was consistently scanned. Dr. Elterman's final report on Twinkle in November 1951 stated in scie ntific terms what Ruppelt had said about the study: \"Project Twinkle was a bust.\" 20 No triangulation was ever achieved, although on April 27, 1950, four objects 30 feet in diameter were r ecorded by a Twinkle team at 150,000 feet over Holloman AFB traveling at high speed. 21 The real question, however, is why did Proj ect Sign not come into the investigation of the new UFO phenomena in a more meaningful way. In fact, some of the most spectacular reports of that or any other year would occur in the very last quarter of 1948. Yet right in the middle of this unsettling rash of events, Sign found itself increasingly ignored and underutilized by the Pentagon. Green fireballs were actually but a small offshoot of this new and larger phenomena which involved varying types of nocturnal lights appearing over a whole host of military installations. Not all of the cases seem to be in the files, but it is apparent from the available re cords that a great deal of concern arose with no guesses as to what could be causing the events. A typical sighting not unlike the Nove mber 23rd incident in West Germany, took place December 3rd at 8:15 P.M. PST on a clear night at th e Fairfield-Suisun AFB, in California. As in the case from Germany, a bright light came into view at about 20,000 feet, a lthough this report differed dramatically in that the object had first made a low level pass over the airfield at only 500 feet! Control tower operators described it as a round white light that silently passed between the tower and the airfreight terminal at a sp eed in excess of 400 miles per hour. Close views through 8-power binoculars revealed no definite form, just a bright light one to two feet in diameter and moving with an undulating or bouncing motion. Then all of a sudden observers witn essed it vertically rise to 3,000 feet and level off—soon thereafter reaching an altitude of 20,000 feet and heading south- southeast. Seen from another nearby control tower, all of the various witnesses were certain that the strange object behaved like no aircraft, balloon, or any type of navigation lights. 22 Sign did thoroughly inves tigate this case but un covered no clues to the mystery. Few times before had highly trained obs ervers been at such a loss to identif y an aerial object. While little could be done other than take statemen ts, the records of the time do c onvey a sense of desperation. The Pentagon wanted to know what could so effor tlessly violate the airs pace of a US military installation, but Sign could no longer suggest what they had formally concluded. 158 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 As a result, team members became increasin gly frustrated—Loedding in particular. The top brass wanted answers, yet would not accept nor even care to listen to what some of the best in Air Force"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Intelligence were trying to tell them. An interesting letter found in a recent release of Sign documents does dramatize how seriously the UFO situ ation was then taken despite official denials. In short, it signified a UFO alert by the Pentagon: This Headquarters has instructed all major Air Commands, both in the ZI and Overseas, to be particularly alerted at this time for sightings of unide ntified aerial objects and to generally comply with the requests contained in subject TWX. This Headquarters has also requested the co operation of the Departments of the Army and the Navy, and the Coast Guard, in instructing their installations along the same lines. 23 Recently there have been some documents come to light that shed a little more light on the late 1948 time period, but they also raise new questions as well. These involve numerous Project Sign and Grudge records released from the Wright-Pa tterson Air Intelligence Agency via the National Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri. For years researchers questioned the presence of such files but were always pacified with the statement that th ese former intelligence records were destroyed in an accidental fire in the St. Louis depository in 1973. Due however to the unending pursuit of truth by legitimate investigators, the lost files fina lly surfaced. While many of these include duplicate information present in the National Archives' Blue Book collection, new information is revealed. A few of the \"missing cases,\" for example, are finally detailed. The incidents are very amazing but hold no new secrets to the UFO phenomenon. Therefore, we now know that some of the \"missing cases\" were in large part just that—missing—or misplaced. Yet the most amazing discoveries are of cases that were never even listed in the vast Air Force index of sightings. Some of the incidents are rather startling for the extrem ely impressive character of the witnesses involved and th e nature of their sightings. In addition, correspondence has also come to light which sheds more light on admini strative matters. Combined with other microfilm rolls of Sign and Grudge files he ld in private hands, (which d uplicate some but not all of the National Archives' Blue Book records) much cross-ch ecking needs to be done to fill in the gaps in the historical record. Years of work are ahead for researchers. Two of the most startling documents discover ed in the Sign and Grudge papers are detailed here. We begin with a letter written by Air Force Intelligence Chief Major General Cabell to the AMC. Cabell states quite Final Word 159 plainly in that correspondence that the reported incidents of UFO ac tivity are clearly of a real and concerning nature. He then inqui res about Project Sign's views on the matter. This is somewhat puzzling considering Cabell mu st assuredly have been privy to the July Estimate draft. Yet five days later Colonel McCoy then responds with an even more straightforward answer. He states a percentage of the phenomenon are admittedly unexpl ainable and must represent craft of \"foreign origin.\" Foreign origin in this case is again us ed to imply extraterrest rial visitation, although the possibility of Soviet activity is still not ruled out. Thus even by 1948 many intelligence officers were forced to either reevaluate a Soviet connecti on or accept a non-earthly theory. Today, following the fall of the Soviet Union, this revelation is even more startling as we now know none of those UFO sightings represented Soviet activity. And certainly no other nati onal power had such technology then or now. Attitudes on how to handle the press are also discussed in the passages. The following letters are therefore quoted in full to demonstrate a rare look at how Air Force officials were actually thinking in the late days of Sign. Such detailed correspondence is very rare in military records:"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Actual document provided here SECRET C O P Y Department of the Air Force Headquarters, United States Air Force Washington 3 Nov 48 Subject: Flying Object Incidents in the United States To: Commanding General, Air Materiel Command Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Dayton, Ohio 1.

The conclusion appears inescapable that some type of flying object has been observed. Identification and the origin of these objects is not discernible to this headquarters. It is imperative , therefore, that efforts to determine whether these objects are of domestic or foreign origin must be increased until conclusive evidence is obtained. The needs of national defens e require such evidence in order that appropriate countermeasures may be taken. 3. In addition to the imperative need for evidence to permit countermeasures, is the necessity of informing the public as to the status of the problem. To date there has been too little data to present to the public. The press, however, is abou t to take it into its own 160 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 hands and demand to be told what we do or do not know about the situation.

In attempting to arrive at conclusions as to the nature of unidentified flying object incidents in the United States, this Comman d has made a study of approximately 180 such incidents. Data derived from initial reports have been supplemented by further info rmation obtained from checklists submitted by mail, from interrogations of other field agencies, and by personal investigation by personnel of this Command in the case of incidents that seem to indicate the possibility of obtaining particularly significant information. 2. The objects described fall into the following gen eral classifications groups, according to shape or physical configuration: a. Flat disc of circular or approximately circular shape. b. Torpedo or cigar shaped aircraft, with no wings or fins visible in flight. c. Spherical or ballo on shaped objects. d. Balls of light with no apparent form attached. Final word 161 3. Some of the objects sighted have definitely been identified, upon further investigation, as weather or upper air scientific balloons of some type. A great many of the round or balloon shaped objects indicated in paragraph 2c above are probably of the same nature, although in most cases, definite confirmation of that fact has been impossible to obtain. 4. Some of the objects have been identified as being astro-physical in nature. For example, in daylight sightings, the planet Venus has been reported as a round silvery object at extremely high altitude. Action is being taken to obtain the services of a prominent as tro-physicist as a consultant, to study all of the incidents to determine whether some can be identified as meteors, planets or other manifestations of astral bodies. 5. Arrangements for accomplishing a study of the psycho logical problems involved in this project are being made in coordination with the Ae ro-Medical Laboratory at this Head quarters. The possibility that some of the sightings are hallucinations, optical illusions or even deliberate hoaxes has been considered. 6. Although explanation of many of the incidents can be obtained from the investigations described above, there remains a certain number of reports for which no reasonable everyday explanation is available. So far, no physical evidence of the existence of the unidentified sightings has been obtained. Prominent scientists, including Dr. Irving Langmuir of the Ge neral Electric Company, h ave been interviewed to determine whether they could advan ce any reasonable explanations for characteristics exhibited by the objects sighted. In an early intervie w, Dr. Langmuir indicated that these incidents could be explained, but insufficient data were available at that time on which to base definite co nclusions. It is planned to have another interview with Dr. Langmuir in the near future to review all the data now available, and it is hoped that he will be able to present some opinion as to the nature of many of the unidentified objects, particularly those described as \"balls of lights.\" 7. All information that has been made available to th is headquarters indicates that the discs, the cigar shaped objects, and the \"balls of light\" are not of domestic origin. Engi neering investigation indicates that disc or wingless aircraft could support themselves in flight by aerodynamic means. It is probable that the problems of stability and control could also be solved for such aircraft. Howev er, according to current aerodynamic theory in this country, aircraft with such configurations would have relatively poor climb, altitude and range characteristic s with power plant now in use. 8. The possibility that the report ed objects are vehicles from anot her planet has not been ignored. However, tangible evidence to support conclusion s about such a possibility are completely lacking. "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 162 Alfred Loedding and The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947 The occurrence of incidents in relatio n to the approach to the earth of the planets Mercury, Venus and Mars have been plotted. A periodic variation in the frequency of incidents, which appears to have some relation to the planet approach curves, is noted, but it may be purely a coincidence. 9. Reference is made to \"The Books of Charles Fort \" with an introduction by Tiffany Thay er, published 1941, by Henry Holt & Co., New York, N.Y. It appears that similar phenomena have been noted and reported for the past century or more. 10. In view of the above, the following conclusions are drawn: a. In the majority of cases reported, observers have ac tually sighted some type of flying object which they cannot classify as an aircraft within the limits of their personal experience. b. There is as yet no conclusive proof that unidentifie d flying objects, other than those which are known to be balloons, are real aircraft. c. Although it is obvious that some types of flying objects have been sighted, the exact nature of those objects cannot be established until physical evidence, such as that which would result from a crash, has been obtained. 11. It is not considered advisable to present to the press information on those objects which we cannot yet identify or about which we cannot present any reasonable conclusions. In the event that they insist on some kind of a statement, it is suggested that they be informed that many of the objects sighted have been identified as weather balloons or astral bodies, and that investigation is being .„, pursued to determine reasonable explanations for the others. 12. A report, summarizing the results obtained from analysis of the data and a technical investigation of the engineering aspects of the object s described, is nearly complete, an d a copy will be forwarded to your headquarters in the near future.
