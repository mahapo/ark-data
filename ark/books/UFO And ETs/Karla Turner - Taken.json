My own investigations have included m ysterious w orldwide c rop formations, a nimal mutilations, and the human abduction s yndrome. I am convinced that humanity is moving from the paradigm that w e are alone in the universe to a new one in which we are not alone and something out there is interacting with us, our animals, and our plant life, forcing glim pses of ot her realiti es upon us. The true nature and purpose of the intelligence, or intelligences, remains an enigma. The eight women in this book report com munic ations ranging from t elepathic thoughts to vi rtual reali ty dreams, but there is no coherent single truth t hat emerges from their experiences, n or from the hundreds of other s in the a bduction syndrome since the 1960s. The sheer num ber of different messages, often contradictory, p roduces c onfusion, m istrust a nd a s ense o f manipulation, even if that m anipulation inspires positi vely or disturbs negati vely. \"Perfectly real aliens exist out there,\" says one of the wom en in T AKEN, \"and it seem s on e kind wants to help us and anot her kind wa nts to dec eive us. \" As each voice is offered for public consideration, there are themes that repeat. One of the most prominent is genetic harvesting fr om earth life to c reate a hybrid species. TAKEN suggests the possibility that a n a lien intelligence h as b een u sing g enetic manipulation to create evolving species on our planet over eons and that Hom o sapiens sapiens might be one such ge netic ally engineered species. If so, w e on the P etri dish might paradoxically be trying t o study whatever watches and studies us. Conscious ness of this Other wit hout running from it or getting down on our knees to it could be a signific ant, perhaps unexpect ed, step in human e volution and survival. - Linda Moulton How e, Creator and Supe rvising TV Producer, UFO Repo rt: Sightings and author of An Alien Harvest and Glim pses of O ther Realities  2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Prologue Indiana, 1954...

Two aliens took B eth down a curved hall and t hrough a door, into a different area. It looked like \"a surgery room,\" and she became afraid they were g oing to kill her there.

I have been forc ibly ta ken and control led by non-human entities. When I told my story of alien encounters in I NTO THE FRINGE, I was contacted by these women and many other peopl e with simi lar ex periences, in n eed of support and as sistanc e. I am also a researcher of abduction repor ts, and fr om these c ontac ts em erged a number o f a ccounts that shed important light on the alien agenda of h uman interaction. This book is the result of lengthy investigations into the ab du ction experi ences of eight w omen from various parts of the country. The c orrelation of ev idenc e fr om their ac count s gr eat ly widens the parameters of the abducti on scenario and poi nts t o certain as pec ts, pr ev ious ly dis regarded or avoided, in need of serious exploration. This is also a personal book, a collation of unique, i ntimate accounts of alien-human interactions. The people who share their exper iences her e are c ourageous repr esentativ es of the many others in this country and el sewhere whose lives partake of parallel realities. They function successfully in a w orld shared by ev eryone else, as hous ewiv es, mothers, grandmothers, artists, nurses, counselors, teachers, computer engineers, and blue- collar work ers. But in the blink of an eye - or the flash of multicolored lights strobing in the hall late at night - their normal lives can dis appear, and they fin d themselves taken into the time and space of an alien w orld. It i s di fficult for most abducti on memories to be inv estigated in a pur ely sc ient ific manner, especially sinc e t hey ar e often s uppr essed, surfacing only as vague fla shb acks a nd d rea mlike e pisodes. In this field there has been strong objection to anecdotal information. But the scientific approach to the study of the UFO phenomenon as a whole has proven les s than successf ul. In spi te of hal f a century of many i ntelligent people researc hing the UFO and alien p resence with scientif ic methods, r eliable answers to t he pri mary questions ha ve not been found. Investigations o f s ightings reports, landing traces, photos and video tapes, alleged implants, and rel ated governm ent doc umen ts hav e amassed a mountain of d ata and a number of theories-but nothing indi sputabl y true about the nature of U FOs and thei r non-human occupants, their origin , or the reason for t heir presen ce here am ong us no w. Great gai ns have been made in the area of abduct ion therapy, pr ov iding help and support for those who ar e li ving with the phenom enon and working to resolve their emotional trauma, to keep t he disruption of their everyday lives to a m inimum, and to transform or assimilate these experiences in a positive way. And while is this laudable, it is not necessarily research. Therapy's goal is one of personal b alance, but the goal of research is a larger, clearer understandi ng of the phenomenon. The point is not s o much lear ning to liv e wit h abdu ctions as it is f inding out why they happen, what they mean, and whether and how the situat ion c an be alt ered. The need for reliable answers is nowhere greater t han in the abduction phenome non. It intimately affects people of all ages and back grounds, i rrevocably altering their personal lives and their perceptions of real ity, and it raises i mmense que stions about our past, present, and futu re as a species.

Science has been tryi ng to m easure a dream, i t seems, using tradi tional ideas and practices, and it has proved elusi ve. The UFO phenomeno n is not confined to our current sci entific underst anding of perceiv ed reality. We do not yet have the technology or natural perceptive abili ties to capture and assess it. That is why the sci enti fic approach to photographic evidence, landing traces, implants, and document an alyses ha s so little in the way of hard evidenc e to show fo r its work. Instead, its best results offer only circumstantial data, carrying very little more weight than the anecdotal data of abduction research i n the s cales of traditional science. It is in the abduction phenomenon that we come most urgently face to face with the alien presence and thus hav e our best oppo rtunity to obs erv e the act ivity and assess i ts purpose or agenda. All of the UFO photos in the world tell us nothing compared to the words of those who have enc ountered t he alien f orce i n their lives and those of their families. And there are many, li ke Pat and Amy and the others p resented h ere. F rom the response to INTOT HE FRINGE, it sometimes seemed that abduction experiences were bec om ing virtually epidem ic. Y et studies by mental health pr ofessi onals show that the people who make these reports are eminently sane , that the aftermath of these events is real , and that they do n ot s pring from a ny m ass p sychosis b ut from exper ienced anomalous trauma. I also found that many of the reports contained details very similar to certain things m y family and I had experi enced. Still , in ever y case there was always p resent the \"unique factor \" within t he sit uat ions, providing highly indiv idualized epis odes for eac h abductee. I often w ondered if these uni que ev ents, these \"one-time shots,\" m ight not prove to have some unperc eived correlations, to form a patte rn as yet out of focus, and give us m ore information than the now-recogniz ed patter ns of cert ain exam s, ba by presentati ons, and the like.

Instead, h owever, these startling lights e ither b lind u s w ith their intensity, so that we cannot see their source, or they ca st strange shadows, whose false appearanc es a nd misleadi ng movements can easi ly confuse and d isorient us. No one k nows this better t han an abductee. Investigators who have not had personal experiences with the phenomenon c an listen to abduction a ccounts and then ponder the possibilities. Was the p erson lying? Was it a real event, or did it occur on a mental level? W hat parts of the recollection are real, and whi ch are illusi onary? B ut the abductee understands that i t may very well be both possibili ties a t once, both real and mental , real and illusionary. The a liens, wh ether b y i ntellectual, p sychic, o r technological means, are able to create any p erception, and therefore any illusion, for the person in thei r hands. The i mpli cations are ex plosi ve. P erhaps that is w hy the logical conclusions of these implications are so rarely taken into account. If we credit the idea of illusionary mastery with serious validity, then we must ei ther come up with a reliable acid test to d iscern illus ion and actuality in abduction events, or we m ay have to admit that the truth behind these e vents is u nknowable in c urrent s cientific terms. Dealing with the aliens' deceptive abilities m ay be the most crucial problem facing abduction research today.

Empl oyed for control, it can be used t o pr event any undesired responses from the abductee. And the altered state prev ents any objective assessment of the situation by the w itness. This means that the witness can only repor t what was seen, felt, and heard-whi ch i s not necessarily a reflection of w hat actually occurred. By inducing and m anipulating altered consc ious ness in the abductee, t he aliens assume full control of the situatio n and thus exert g reat control o ver the d ata reported by the w itness. Abductees report alien-controlled inform ation. This is a fact abduction researchers m ust face. Then, perhaps, work can begin on solving this p roblem, on finding ways around the memory blocks and screen illusions, in or der to discover the real e vents and the agenda behind them. Until the day we ca n unmask the alien illusions, however, we can at least st udy the entire body of repor ted data, c ontrolled though i t may be , trying to lear n mor e about why certai n images and ev ents are empl oyed and what they can tell us about the co vert direct ors of these sce narios.

Suc h om iss ions ar e c lear ly a hindrance to research, f or the censored reports cannot present a total pi cture of t he abduc tion phenomenon. It must in clude a r eal f eeling for what it is like to live with such events. Abduc tees operate in parallel realities, searc hing for the strength to c ope wi th the real and t he unreal at the same time because, as they have learned, one can never be sure which is which in this phenomenon. The number of abduction reports around the c ountry shows just how widespread the phenom en on m ay be, and t he num ber s cont inue t o inc reas e. Eight di fferent abdu ctees , all w omen, from v arious p arts o f the country have volunteered to share their experiences here. B orn between 1943 and 1966, they live in five different states and Puerto Rico. They were unacquainted with one anot her at the time of their c ontacts with me. Their backgrounds are as varied as thei r occupati ons, and so are thei r ideas about the abduction phenomenon. Like most of us who've had alien encounters, these w omen are uncertain about the nature of the events they'v e reported. They have m any questions and ver y few ans wers. F our of the wom en hav e never undergo ne r egress ive hypn osis and thus are only repo rtin g e ven ts the y con scio usly re called . Th e o the r f our women have used hypnosis, although very m inimally as will be noted in their ac counts, and al most everything in thei r reports al so comes from c onscious, pre-hypnosis, recollections. I point this out because there are some who have r aised doubts and questions about the use of regressive hypnosis in abduction research. S ome feel that hypnotically retriev ed inf ormation is no m ore reliable than conscious recollections; some bel ieve that the us e of hy pnosis ca n c ontam inate and d amage an investigation; and some have said they b elieve hypnotically retrieved info rmation is far more reliable in abduction situations than the witness's conscious me mori es. The presentation here provides access to both types of data, but the m ajority comes from con scious recollections. Although I believe it is extremely useful to employ r egressive hypnosis in the retrieval of this in forma tion , I also think it is i mportant to present a ccounts from women whose k nowledge a nd understandi ng of thei r situati ons is gleaned only from t he incomplete, ambiguous memories of events they h ave consciously retained. Their stories and their lives are m uch m ore representative of a \"typical\" abductee's situati on than are the accounts of those who have benefited from hypnosi s, simply because m ost abductees have no access to thi s tool. The women are not seeking no toriety, and in or der to protect them from public harassment, pseudonyms have been use d. But all of the details are accurate, and a s bizarr e as they m ay seem, it is important to remember that they are very real to the peopl e involved, that in m any instances there have been m ore than one witness to the events, as well as other corroborativ e evidenc e, and that they are high ly cons istent with num erous abduction reports.

These, then, are the motivations of the eight women. My ow n purpose is similar, which is why an update of the experienc es my husband and I have witnessed is also included. An overview of all our exper iences, as w ell as reports of other abductees, shows a much more complex program of activi ty in the phenomenon than i s usually acknowledged. T o b egin w ith, the abduc tion scenario comp rises a number of different types of events. On the most i mmediate level are the p hysical abductions, in which a person is forcibly re moved from the normal environmen t by 'alien' (in t he most generi c sense) entities , the person's awareness is a ltered, a nd some interaction occurs. Subs equent consc ious memor ies of the event are usuall y quite incomplete. Onl y when the event is witness ed by mo re t han one person, or when there a re phy sical m arks on t he abduct ee's body-punct ures, sco ops, p atterns o f bruises, a rtificial designs-does the witness usuall y feel safe in asse rting the 'rea lity' of the encounter. To complicate matters, many reports show that some interactions occur on a mental rather than a physical level. O ne type is an artificially induced v irtual-reality scenario (VRS), an externally introduc ed ev en t, that to the wit nes s is pr actically indi stingui shabl e from objective reality. The person may experience a situation with full sensory input and react with genuine phy sical and em otional respons es, al thou gh i n 'real ity' the per son may be l ying immobile on an ex am table, or sitting attached to some alien appar atus, or even asleep in bed with no outward sign of disturbance. While the V RS may have been a ma tter of theory in the past, a possible explanation for some of the more \"unacceptable\" abduction accounts, i t has now been confirmed in a three-witness, conscious event. It came to light when I was in vestigating the abduction e xperiences of Ted Ric e, a psy chic of exc ellent reputat ion t hroughout the s out her n sta tes. Ted witnes sed a v irtual-r eality sc enario when he w as in Florida visiting a friend, Marie, along with another hous e guest, Am elia. The two women o ccupied twin beds in one room, and Ted slept down t he hall in anot her. Not lo ng after going to b ed on e night during his v isit, he was awakened by Marie s houting for him to \"come quickly!\" Heading down the hall, Ted saw a pervasive blue glow emanating from the other be droom doorway. E ntering, he found Marie pressed against the far wall, staring at the twi n beds in shock. And he saw w here the bl ue l ight was coming from. Amelia lay immobile in one bed, sur rounded by a huge, blue, glo wing, \"electrical\" sphere of light. Her eyes were open, and she didn't seem to be in any distress as she carried on a conversation with s omeone Ted and Mar ie couldn't s ee. T errif ied, th ey tried to talk to her, but they could hardly hear one another even when shouting. Ame lia continued to speak w ithin the sphere for several minutes, until the blue light suddenly disappeared, at which point she w as fi nall y free of the paralysis that had kept her in t he bed. Amelia told Ted and Mari e that the experience st arted with the loud s ound of a h elicopter low over the house. When s he opened her eyes she could see t hrough the ceiling and roof, as i f they'd disappeared, t o wh ere the helicopt er wa s hovering j ust above t he house. She descr ibe d two entities in the craft, whom she said also appeared at the f oot of the bed before t he b lue 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"light vanished. One being was ta ll, with greenish sk in, an egg-shaped head, an d slanted eyes as the only visible facial features. The other , shorter, entity, Amelia said, was blue-black in color. Ted and Marie had seen absolutely nothing of these creatures, nor had they heard a helicopter at any time. But they had seen t he sphere of light, wit h b righter, darting lights shoot ing through it, and Amelia frozen in a slightly raised position inside it, for she had been starting to sit up when the light c oalesced and paralyzed her. Amelia's perception of the experience was completely \"real\" for her. She w as conscious when it b egan and throughout the entire event, as Ted and Marie attested. From everything her sensory input t old her, Amelia had experienced an actual event with t he craft and entities . Virtual reality. A nd the cons cious and una ffect ed wit nes ses , Ted and Marie, o bserv ed objectively real effects of the mec hanism w hich manipulated the event, ve rifying its external origin. VRS tec hnology exists and is in us e, t his much is clear . And unless there ar e outs ide wit nes ses, such as in this rare instance, the experiencer cannot personally disc ern between a VRS and an actual event. The virtual-reality sce nario may occur while the person is conscious, as in A melia 's case, or it m ay be intr oduced int o the pers on's dream state. A ccording to those who've experienced the VR S drea m-and I am one of those, as will be discussed later-it is an in trusive event that suddenly interrupts a normal dream. The experiencer i s aw are of a total , abrupt chang e in conscious ness and finds himself in a n event altogether different from his dream. What follows may be a perc eiv ed event, wit h action, locati on, and personnel , or i t may be a communication or even a vision. At its conclusion, the experiencer normally awakens, and, finding himself in his own bed, he rationalizes the w hole thing as an extraordinary dream, in spite of the event's decidedly non-dreamlike qualities. Without physical proof of the event's reality, or even a name for this al tered p erceptive experiential event, he is left to call it a d ream. In addit ion t o the abduct ions and virtual- reality scenario s, abduc tees also repo rt telepathic contacts from entities who are not physically or perceivably p resent. These contacts include m essages about s piritual m atter s, war nings of futur e dis asters, \"teaching\" sessions, displays of symbols, and inf ormation on m athem atics, phy sics, religion, polit ics, and t he nat ure of t he hum an s pecies.

H e took Pat's right hand and said, Do not be afraid, m y child. Thes e are mine, gesturi ng to th e bei ngs who w ere standi ng al l ar ound t he r oom. The J esus figure looked at Pat and s aid, I am the light of the wor ld. Then he w as again surrounded by the sparkling shaft o f light, w hich ascended back into the ceilin g and too k him with it. She and her grandmother were fl oated out of the room by the entities. Passing by her mother's bedroom, Pat saw a brilliant white light coming out of t he room. Five of the taller Whites were around her step- fathe r's bed, and the y seeme d to be ex ami ning one o f his atrophied legs, the result of polio. A glowing green bar of light, about fi ve inches long, floated over hi m. C ontinui ng on through the house and out into the ya rd, Pat saw a bright crystalline flying craft hovering low to the ground. A beam of l ight came out of the bottom of the craf t and engulfed h er. \"I remember my sister's blonde curly head next to mine as we went up inside the craft,\" Pat said. \"W e were looking down at t he ground and saw my mom and grandm other there looking up, like zombies.\" She c ould also s ee that the ent ire y ard was s warming with Grays hurrying about the ar ea. Al though nei ther s he nor Rose is certain of the exact sequence of events, they recalled a group of the smaller gray beings near a ditch beside the cellar door. Rose saw the beings in a l ine, walking across a board spanning the ditch. But Pat's memory included a line or wall of fi re in the d itch and a row of \"small, gray, skinny\" aliens wear ing \"Chines e rice-paddy hats wi th big brim s.\" \"I was on one side of the long di tch, and they were on the other. They w ere m entally tellin g me Pass through the light, it will not burn you - which I was t hinking at that time, that I would get burned. T he f ire was not hot, and i t was supposed to clea nse m e. I d id go through it to t he other s ide, but I do not r emember doing it or what happened after that.\" After the li ght transport ed her and Rose up into the craft, Pat recalled sitting on a table in a roo m with Grays present. A taller White came over with a file-t ype instrument and scraped s kin from her inner forearm and the bottoms of her feet, clipped some of her hair, and then peeled away samples of her fingernails. â What do you need all those pieces of me for?\" she asked. We ar e making a new you, the entity replied. \"Are you an ange l?\" P at inqui red. Yes, the enti ty tol d her, but not like you have been taught. Pat w as taken i nto another room w here s he l ay on a table, abov e whic h was a dark instrument. One of t he G rays came in and pulle d down a tube from this d evice which had a thin needle on the end. Pat b ecame afraid, but the Gray told her, Thi s is th e part 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"you don't have to rem ember. Pat knew that the needle was about to be inserted up into her right nostril, but bef ore it happen ed she passed out. Pa t recalled another event during the physical exam, be ing \"fus ed\" wit h a s ilver light. \"It was done from s omething over my b ody, \" she said, \" up hi gh in the roo m. He [alien ] 'fused me' into my head with the silver light; it will keep m e from violent harm; it let me be perfect in human form fo r a few seconds; it was a p rotective light . I get the id ea t hat when this silver light goes into my 'other body' I will be made i nto t he 'new me.' In other words, the 'new m e' will come to life with my soul in it.\" Pat came back to consci ousness after th e epi sode with the needl e and found herself back in the first room on the table. She was crying because she couldn't stay with the Grays. When they told her, It isn't tim e yet, she asked for a s ouvenir as proof that t he experience had really occurred : the green \"healer\" rock she'd seen a bove h er step- father's body. Although the aliens appar ently ga ve her t his devic e, they told her that it would not \"work\" properly for her, only for them. She was also told, You ar e going to ha ve to forget this. \"Why?\" Pat asked. Bec ause there ar e t hose who wi ll tam per with you r m ind, the Gray replied. Pat was returned to the house, w here she saw all o f her family sitting in the living room in a daze. ' They looked like zombies,\" Pat said. Even her step-father was propped up on the floor leaning against a s ofa. She was placed in her bed and saw one of t he Grays outside her w indow gesturing a farew ell. She responded with a wave and was immediately asleep a gain. The next day, there doesn't seem to have been any d iscussion about the previous night's ex trao rdi nary even ts. B ut P at's b rothe r recal ls tha t it w as th at d ay when t he m ilitar y personnel arrived. A w hite staff car, a green car, a jeep, and seve ral white vans came onto the property carrying i nstruments and equipment. T here w as also a troop carrier wit h soldiers who pr oceeded t o comb over the entire s ixteen acres of the farm. The large truck w as hidden in the bar n, and Pat's brother said that he had to move the animal f eed to t he smokehouse because the s oldiers wouldn't l et hi m into the barn once their equipment was stored there. \"They c ame in our house and s et up equipment in t he living room,\" Pat recalled. \"The army men wan ted to talk to m e the m ost, me , an eleven-year-old gir l with secrets in my head. But the beings told m e I couldn't tell because 'there will be those who will tamper with your mind.' And he re th ey were , the tamperers, the arm y men.\" Everyone except her brother-w ho was allowed to go out in order to take care of th e farm animals-was kep t inside the h ouse fo r t he fou r days in which the military per sonnel were present. Only her brother saw what was going on outside the house. He remembers more than twenty soldiers brought in the b ig truc k and told to m an t heir stations on the farm.

We moved to town before my twelfth birthday in A ugust 1955.\" It wasn't until 1986 that the memories of the aliens and t he milit ary came back . Pat does not want any personal publicity bec aus e of thes e e vents, but s he has a sked me to include the actual location and date of this event-Floyd's Knob, Indiana, in 1954 - in the hope t hat there may be readers from that area who r emember seeing the military vehicles that came into t he town and who can thus provide some outside v erification of the things she and her brother and siste r have recalled . I asked if any other unusual ev ents had occurr ed s ince then, knowing from m y research that m ost abductees have reported multipl e experi ences in thei r lives. P at, it tu rns ou t, was no excepti on. In the fall of 1962, mak ing a tr ip t o Kent ucky with a friend, Pat got lo st for a while before spotting a sign for Ft. Knox. Laughing about the conf usion, they retraced the route in search of their destination. But instead, they ended up in a deserted trai n yard, si tting in the car with the engine off. Pat said they felt as if t hey'd just \"come out\" of some unremembered experience, w ith no idea why the car was stopped. They never found their desti nation and finally gave u p, returning home at dark. 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"But later in a dream Pat reca lled be ing out of the c ar wit h her friend beside her. She saw a ripple of golden light like an \"elevator\" m oving up at an angle and \"angels\" on each side. She said they were \"respectful \" of a bl ond man w ho seemed to her l ike Jesus. Her friend was screaming hysterically, \"They w ant you!\" Pat replied, \"Don't be afraid, it's okay.\" She went up to the blond man who was surrounded by a beautiful light. He talked to her about becoming a m other and about a \"seed of life.\" He sai d he had the p ower of all seed in his hand. A t the end of the experience, he held out his hand to he r and showed her a seed, telling her it was f or her benefi t and to h ave no fear. A few months later, Pat, who was now pregnant, m oved to Florida. She remembers telling he r husb and t hat the baby would be a boy , but t hat it wouldn' t be viabl e. \"I'm goi ng to have it but not keep it,\" she told him, unable to explain how she knew this. For the next several m onths she and her two children lived in a garage apartment. One ni ght, Pat came to cons ciousness just as she wa s wa lking into the apartment as if she had been outside, although she di dn't re call bei ng the re. S he fel t an odd , pl easant vibratory sensation and remembered thinking, They cam e and got m e. Nothing m ore seems to have happened at this t ime, and Pat continued to have her prenatal check ups which s how ed that everyt hing was p rogressing fine with the baby. But then in the eighth month, the doctor could not find a fetal heartbeat. A nd when s he deliver ed at full-term in May, the b aby boy was stillborn. The foreknowl edge proved t rue. Later that same year, Pat remembers finding hersel f in a quiet room, surrounded by Grays and waiting for something. The G ray she thought of as her \"friend\" appear ed in the door way, showing her a baby . He tol d her that she had a choi ce to see the b aby. \"No,\" Pat replied, \"it's okay, it's fine. You'll take better care of it than I could.\" But in that brief glimpse, s he saw a tiny, skinny baby wit h blue, slanted eyes. She felt that somehow t his baby was a repos itory for the soul of the child who had die d at b irth, and she s aid s he felt trusting and thankful toward her friend for showing her that the little boy had, in a s ense, surv ived. Of the memories which have surfaced i n the past se veral years, no ne rai ses mo re ques tions than t he \"c ocoon peopl e.\" \"I can't rememb er w hen the actual event might have occurred,\" Pat told me. \"All I recall is being in a lar ge room wit h soft whit e light ing, and one of the Grays was ther e.

There was white mis ty stuff all over them, and I knew the misty stuff kept them alive. I knew they were waiting to co me to life in the fu ture .\" The being asked Pat, Do you want to see yours? Pat said, \" Yes,\" and was shown a human female body in one of the co ntainers. \"Don't 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ask how I knew it wa s f emale,\" she continued, \"I just felt it.

I knew this w as connected with the 1954 visi t, because I re membered they told me they were mak ing a 'new me.' I felt this cocoon was the new me. I felt that they are w aiting for the resurrection,\" she said, \"or reani mation, and w e will a ll b e able to see and talk wit h them he re o n earth. If I were to die now, I believ e that my 'other body ' will house my soul when Jesus say s it is time, and I, too, will come back. If I live thr ough all the destruction (to come) into the new world, I will still need m y other body, as this one I have will die an yw ay.\" In her mid-fort ies, Pat ha d another experience with the beings, and this tim e she recalled being in a room li t wi th a golden glow. She was taken to a desk-s ized device in the top o f w hich w ere circular openings. In each opening was a different col ored vibrating light, and she was tol d to put her hands in the lights. As she did, she heard the most beautiful s ounds she had ever heard. Each light made a d ifferent sound. That is the sound of your soul, the Gray told her. Pat unders tood that this had something to do with t he inanimate human bodies she had been s hown, bodies which didn't have a \"so ul power\" acti vati ng t hem. In 1987, P at had anoth er possible experience - much more typical of the usual abduction reports - which incl uded her young gr andson. \"Was t his a dr eam ?\" she m used w hen relating it to m e. \"I have no proof. I was in my daughter's house, and i t was nighttime. I seemed to be floating to my grandson's r oom. I took his han d, and we floated together, upright, about six i nches off the floor. We floated out the fron t d oor , ou t to the driveway, and s topped while the ga te s wung open to t he r oad. Ther e were about t en or fifteen beings across the road in the woods. They all rose up out of the woods at the same time. I could hear my g randson think, Mamaw, c an I play with t hos e k ids? \"I thought back to him, No, honey, these are special ki ds, the y don' t pl ay like re gu lar kids. We floated down the r oad to the cul-de-sa c. T here in the dead-end c ircle was a ship with red 'blips' that went around it, a saucer. There w as a 'door' w ith light. W e floated up a ramp, and I saw my 'being fr iend' and then I don't r emember any more. Anyway, my grands on and I went toge ther on thi s trip . Or I'd ra the r call it a d ream-I'm not sure.\" Pat had a number of intens ely a ffecting experi ences that occurred whil e she was in a meditative or dream state, and so she has been unab le to feel confident that they w ere \"real.\" In some of these dream-ev ents she has seen a variety of flying c raft; she has had a ppa rent out -of-body ex per ienc es; and sh e has r eceived te lepathic communi cati ons. One such event in October 199 2 seemed related to some of her previous experiences. \"I dreamed someone w as ta lking to m e m entally,\" she s aid, \"telling me things. I couldn't grasp the exact words, but I heard one sentence like this: The destruction comes in f our quariens. 'Quar ien' is not a word we know, but I took it to mean four parts of som e kind. Then I saw what I call a graph. I fel t as though I was g etting a gentle warning of the 'bad time on eart h' like it is very near to happening now.\" 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Such warnings had not only been giv en t o Pat at various tim es in he r life, but they have been part of many abductees' experienc es and are indeed one of t he most commonly reported events in this phenomenon. So are unex plained physi cal marks on abduct ees' bodies , a nd here again Pa t fits the pattern. In the summer of 1993, Pat discover ed an unusual design on her inner wrist, a circle of six dots wi th a sev enth dot in the center . This des ign, incidentally , was reported in a handful of cases i n 1991 and 1992, and it may not be a coincidence that these cases have m ostly come from Florida, where Pat lives. A c ouple of mont hs after the design appeared, P at had an ex peri ence relating to this circular pattern. \"I had a dream August 7, in the middle of the a fternoon,\" she explained. \"It was one of those 'naps' that [makes you] 'hi t the bed and you're out li ke a light.' There were v oices in my dream that sounded like soft w hispers, and I began to listen more closely. 'There was something said about 'being innocent li ke a chil d,' and thi s feeli ng fl ooded my whole body and s oul. It felt like being in the state of pure i nnocence without knowing anything about fear, hate, prejudice ...a pure, wonderful state of being in love, sec ure, protect ed, and ' without si n' as we call it. I saw a sc ene from my child hood of the town I lived in. It looked like it did way back then. I saw m yself, about elev en years old. My feeling in the dream was of gr eat 'Then a voice said to me, Get up, child, and look to t he Nebulous. I t can tak e you t here. And in my dream I got up and unl ocked my back door and looked up in a daytime sky and saw a m ost beautiful circle of lights w ith one light i n the middle, spinning around li ke marquee li ghts on a movie hous e, all spi nning i n golden color. It was beautiful, and the voice said I could not go now, because in that dream I was pleading to go to the Nebulous now. When he said I c ouldn't go now, I begged him to let m e see it when I was in my conscious mind. He said he would, but I hav en' t seen it yet . It was like a wondr ous t hing f or another ti me in my life. But my overall feeling was that I would have di ed to go to this Nebul ous. \"I wok e up very groggy, like I was on dr ugs, and h urried to write it down before I could forge t. Th e nebulous design was the same as th e design on my w rist.\" Pat fel t she understood what \"Nebul ous\" meant, associating it w ith the lighted circular object she first saw . But \"nebul ous\" is an adjecti ve rather than a noun-\" nebula\" is the proper form-and thus there is no specific definition for referenc e other than \"cloudy,\" \"lacking form,\" and \"unidentified,\" a ccording to the dictionary. Exact ly two mont hs lat er, on October 7, Pat r eceived a related communication while in a cons cious state of mind, explaining the \"Nebulous.\" A voice said, The Nebulous is a code; the code has been b roken. Pat saw a whole Nebulous followed by a b roken one. \"I could see a jellylike stuff that connected the dots,\" she described. \" I knew tha t the Nebu lous was th en something t hat w as in our bodies when we were created. When we were created, we were s upposed t o have a per fect N ebulous. This gave u s personal contact w ith o ur C reator. W hen the Nebulou s w as broken, by di sobedience, we no longer had personal contact with the Creator. W e had to adapt to livin g on our ow n, thus losing our i nnocence an d pure s tate of be ing in hum an form.\" 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" This image reinforces Pat's altered underst anding of God and a spi ritual pl an. Overall , her experiences with the alien entities have, to the best of her conscious recoll ection, felt very positive. With a strong religious faith, she has accepted them as a ngels. \"In my abductions,\" she has said, \"I have never g otten a fe elin g o f evil. In fa ct, I fel t mo st protected while in the presence of the beings. Some people may s ay that the beings have the power to control what you feel and think at the ti me of the abduc tion, which t hey most certainly do. But I am hanging on to the c hildlike fa ith that Je sus tried to teach us and believe that w hat I fel t was true and g ood. Why would an al l-loving Go d a llow little c hildren to be ab du cted if the beings were evil and meant to do us harm? I don't b elieve God would allow it. Even so,\" Pat conceded, \"there are things which the beings do that seem wrong to us and s eem violent. \" There has been one very dist urbing ex perience, however, w hich occurred on July 24, 1993. It involved not only an alien entity but also w hat clearly appeared to be two human men and a human environment. In the early m orning hours, P at awoke in a very grog gy condition, feeling as if she'd been drugged, and hearing a strange nois e very near her, making staccat o psss, pssss, psss, psss sounds. Then s he r emembered. Two men had c ome in to her bedroom, car ried her outsi de and into a w aiting vehicle, a lar ge \"military-type\" truck. She was in a drugged state, merging in and out of consciousness as the truck took off and rode smoothly for forty-five m inutes to an hour . In her brief lucid moments, Pa t hear d t he m en en gaged in low co nver sat ion that she couldn't understand. S he tried to speak up, but her tongue was thic k and unwieldy. When the truck turn ed l eft onto a rough surfac e, Pat came awake a gain and in the dark night caught only a glimps e of t he countryside out of the large, square front windshield. The truck slowed down and finally stopped with t he engine running. Through the window Pat saw they w ere parked nex t to a la rge mound or hills ide. Incredibly, she saw a large doorway open outward, and the truck pull ed ins ide, into the hi ll. T he interior was very di mly li t, but as the vehi cle stopped in side, P at saw a strange bei ng standi ng as i f waiting for their arrival. T he being was no mo re than thr ee (eel tall, dressed in a black hooded cape. Look ing at t he being gr oggily, Pat thought, What i s an or iental girl doing here? And immediately a telepathic mess age came back f rom the being, / know you don't l ike me. No, Pat thought, no, I don't. I don't want to do this a gain. Bu t they can't break me , because they couldn't do i t before. When the truck pa rked and she was assisted out, stepping a long way down fr om t he high passenger compartment, Pat saw that the area was crowded and \"dirty\" feeling, with boxes and \"junk\" st acked along o ne wall. In the middle of the lar ge room was a stainless steel table, more human-looki ng than the t ables she re membered fr om alien 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"encounters, and she felt very uneasy. \"They wanted me to get on it,\" she said, \"but I didn't want to. Not that table.\" But she d id get on it, although she didn't remember m uch about w hat m ay have happened. The \"oriental girl\" hovered around her, m oving close and poking at her with some object Pat couldn't see. But s he did see the enti ty's face close t o hers, its skin a greenish-gray color. When the c reature's eyes blinked and i ts lids met in the middl e, Pat s aid the effe ct was repugnant, reminding her of a l izard. Her next recollection was of getting dow n fr om the table and trying to see what the \"oriental girl\" was doing to her. The enti ty kept mo vin g arou nd Pat, much to her irrit ation, making an errat ic psss, pssss, psss sound. Trying to support hers elf by holding to t he table, she moved away from the entity, but it continued to poke at her. Pat was more aler t but still unsteady, and as she ci rcled the table she stubbed her to e pai nfully agai nst i t. Looking down at her foot, she noticed in s urprise that the floor w as c overed w ith sawdust. God, she thought, this isn't even a real floor! With a bit more awar enes s, Pa t avoided the being a s m uch as she could, feeling that whatever it was doing was a so rt of \"torment.\" Suddenly she bla cked out, and wh en she came ba ck to con sci ousn ess, i n he r b ed, the psss, pssss was audible there bes ide her b riefly. Two days later, Pat noticed a slight bruise on her wrist, with a red dot or puncture inside it. An d she also saw that one of her toena ils was badly c hipped, almost into the quick, as if it had forcefully struck som ething hard. \"I di dn't like that si tuati on at all,\" Pat told me , \"and I knew that it wa sn't the fi rst ti me I had seen t hat 'oriental girl.' I've been on that tabl e before, too,\" she added, rememberi ng how uneasy it m ade her feel . She knew that the greeni sh-skinned, lizard-eyed b eing w as not human, even though the men, the truck, the travel , and the under ground facility all certainly seemed to be. \"What kind of ali ens,\" she wo nder ed, \"are involved with the government or mili tary?\"  22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" III - Polly Polly f irst contacted me in late 1992, before s he even fi nished r eadin g I NTO TH E FRINGE . \"I am on page 176,\"' her letter said, \"and I had to stop to write y ou.\" A pass age disc uss ing alien interest in hum an s exuality had struck a chord that resonated with some of her pos sible exper ienc es. I n the smal l town where she lived, Polly said, she couldn' t fin d a good support system because the only UF O st udy group in t he area had no wom en. She as ked if I c ould put her in t ouch with other fe mal e abductees \"for mutually beneficial correspondence.\" What she needed to discuss wa s too int imate for sharing with anyone other than a nother woman with similar experiences. \"I have been involved with the UFO phenomenon a pparently all my life, and my children also are or have been involved, \" she wrot e. \"My father also has h ad experi ences, but he is ver y caref ul whom he t alks to about them, as he is respected as a technical person and is active still in [a military organization].\" Polly explained that she needed \"a woman abductee bu ddy\" bec aus e of the s exua l nature of some of the events she had endu red. \"I have all my l ife been seriously traumat ized, with the sympt oms of a v ictim of lo ng-term incest,\" she wrote, noting that h er obsessi on with \"fantasies of str ange sexual abuse i nvolving [unfamiliar] intrusive instruments\" began w hen she was four years old. And its consequences had deeply affected her adult life. \"You stopped me short with your disc uss ion of alien- instigated sexual obsessions,\" she continued. \"I have since my teen years found myself every few years in a totally irrational sexually obsessive relationship, characterized by some intelligen ce talking to me in my mind, directin g my act ions , and apparent ly setting up biz arre c oincidences to stage interactions.\" For the most part, Polly noted, her per sonal rel ationships had not been obsessive. But h aving learned from expe rienc e that she c ould be exter nally m anipulated in her sexual activi ties, she no longer s ought out such involvem ents. \"I no w sim ply st ay out o f all relat ionships of a sexual nat ure,\" she t old me. \" The sexual and 'psychic' energy in [the last relations hip] was intense to the poi nt of being ridicul ous , total ly 'direc ted ' and inv olved fre que nt telepat hy an d t ransf erenc e of feel ings. I am in c ounse ling for childhood incest, but there is only so f ar I can go with it, because I don't have a human incest background.\" Polly's letter listed several UFO sightings and alien-encounter i ncidents i n her fami ly's experiences, and most of the details were familiar from my r esearch with o ther abductees . The list included \" interactions with 'Elves'; a crea ture that seemed to s losh through physical objects as if they were water; the usual zigzagging lights; lights that app ear ed outs ide my window ever y night at about the sam e time and watched me for sever al hour s; m addening p oltergeist activity; a nd m any, m any v ivid 'abduction' dreams.\" 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" \"I make no claim for them,\" Polly wrote, \"b ut I know how they fe lt, a sense since young childhood that something was in m y head to keep track of me, a s quealing sound sort of in my head which seems associated wit h contact, and bedroom visitors whic h m y dog, my son, and I all saw.\" Polly had merely listed these events, but as a researcher I w as interested i n the detai ls. I wa s a lso interested in th e pers on who was trying to c ope with t his ph en om enon. Replying to her l etter, I asked f or more in formation about her e xperiences and offered t o be a good listener , bot h as an abduc tee and a woman. Although I had no recollection o f a ny sexually oriented en counters myself, I had learned m uch from others who had been thro ugh such events. And my husband Casey, wh ose full account i s rel ated in INTO T HE FRI NGE, had him self exper ienced a sexual scenario w ith w hat appeared to be a hybri d alien female w hen he w as a very young teen. Such ev ent s, I knew , we re re al in terms of their sens ations a nd aftereffects, and any under standi ng of these scenarios would shed important li ght on the overall ab du ction ag en da . I explained these two concerns when I answered P olly's letter, and she agreed to share her information with m e as part of m y ongoing research. Through letters, phone calls, and taped discussions, I learned m uch ab ou t Polly and the things she an d her children had exper ienced. A t all, fair, striking wom an in her mid-forties, Po lly's ethnic back ground is European, p rimarily Celtic, and Scandinav ian. She is an excellent a rtist, but much of the time in supporting her family she has w orked at rather physical jobs. P olly w as born in 1946 in New Jersey and grew up in the Sout heast. Widowed, she now lives w ith her children in the Adirondacks. In addi tion to the vari ous UFO s ight ings t hey had w itnes sed in this ar ea, it soon bec ame clear that her y oungest son, Sam, was also hav ing curr ent alien enc ounters. I n his taped communi cations and th e drawings and reports to Polly whic h were shared w ith me, Sam showed unusual maturity and insight for an eleven-year-old. Everything they told me came strictly from their co nsc ious rec ollect ions wh ich, concerni ng any given event, w ere ve ry in compl ete. Pol ly relegated some of h er experiences to the \"vivid dr eam\" category, a c ommon response of many abduct ees. The statem ent, \"I make no claim for them,\" m eant that s he c ould not obj ect ively ver ify t hes e events as part of our \"us ual\" reality. Some of them are simila r to the virtual -reali ty s cenario (VRS) dream discussed earlie r, and some seem to have been simply the surfacing memories of actual events. Nonetheles s, to Polly they were \"experienced\" events, and if they occurred strictly within a menta l or ps ychic framewor k they st ill gav e h er every semblance of reality. The nature of that \" reality\" was often ambiguous, however, but there were some experiences she had verified as \"real\" b ecause they had been multiply w itnessed o r perceived while she knew hersel f to be in a conscious state of mind . These began very early in Polly 's childhood. \"When I was four years old,\" she told m e, \"I saw the skinny being who appear ed in silhouette against my w indow shade. It was night, but a bright light, perhaps orangish in color , shone from the other side o f the 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"shade. The room was dark except f or the illu mination o utside the shaded window. The being turned to approach me . When I get to this point in the m emory, I start shaking my head and saying, 'No, noâ and then the me mor y stops. I tell mys elf if the memo ry comes over me again, I will get beyond thi s point and find out what happens next, but I nev er d o.\" This was also the age, probably not coincid entally, at which she began having the sexual fantasies of \"intrusive unfamiliar instrum ents\" used on her. A dditionally she reported, \"About age f our, I had a sens e of some thing having been put behind my left e ar.\" The next ev ent poss ibly relat ed t o alien ac tivity occurred around the age of fourteen: the o nset o f a n obsession with understandi ng \"the workings of the uni verse. \" S he explained, \"It was like I awakened to a sense of cos mic mission an d to an ap ocalyptic sort of sense of human desti ny. I felt I must understand the uni verse. It became a constant undercurrent of s triving w hich persists ev en now.\" G iven t he reports of other abductees, some of which will be present ed later, it was intere sting that she related this \"job and task on eart h\" to \"Armageddon.\" When she was in her late tw enties, livi ng in a d ifferent location, the next event took place. \"Outside the cabin in the Blue Ridge Mountains,\" she said, \" very loud stompi ng, like several m en in w ork boots, suddenly began on our front porch after no sound of approach. We saw shadow y fi gur es accompanying the v ery loud stom ping. But I don't remember it stopping. I rec ollect we went to sleep in the m idst of all this commotion, which of c ourse makes no sens e if w e were lying only a few yards from prowlers. We awoke in the m orning, remembered the stomping a nd shadowy figures, and went outside to hunt for f ootprints but found none.\" In early 1987, however, Polly ha d a consci ous look at her m ysterious intruders. W hile sick in bed, she sai d, \"I had a couple of bedroom vi sitations by two b lack-robed figures. They had lar ge slant ed, glowing, lemon-yellow eyes with no pupils, just like lig hts . The b lack - robed figures were about four feet tall. They w ere identical except that one was a little lighter, like charc oal gray ins tead of bla ck. W hen they m oved t hey did ev erything simultan eous ly to each ot her. They glided through my son' s toy box when they lef t-the lower parts of their robes ju st went right t hrough it.\" Polly not ed that this ev ent occurred before she had ever seen the cover of Whitley Strieber's COMMUNION or any other representation of the typical Gray alien figures. \"Someone asked me if I had asked the figur es what they w anted . My response was NO! I didn't want to give them any open ers! My feeling was that t hey had co me to take me perm anently, and I dev oted all my energy to re buking them. \" An extr emely unus ual s eries of events commenced i n late 198 7. \"The whole thing sta rted with a dream,\" Polly explained. \"I dreamed I was flying over the At lant ic towar d the Mediterranean. A white plan e with red m arkings shaped like a small C oncorde w as approac hing me from the op pos ite direction, the east. \"Shortly after this dream,\" Poll y continued, \"I n oticed that I was having conversations in 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"my head in French.

The drivi ng condi tions took all her c oncentration, so she was startled when the French c ommunication began. \"Evec was saying that he wanted me to join wit h him in prayer for world peace. So I tried praying in French, and t hat was a tot al disa ster. I don't rem ember whose idea it was, but we decided to pray in Latin, and that went much better. I w as sa ying t hings f rom the Ma ss in L atin, cle arly se eing the snowy surroundings an d driving compet ent ly, but just as cl early I began to see, like in some sort of par allel v ision, the ins ide of a (probably Rus sian Orthodox) cathedral. There was a priest in a dark red robe with some kind of tall, funny hat. The interior w as not ornate, but the ceiling was high and there was a lot of rich, poli shed wood. There was a cho ir cons isting of both m en and wo men . \"I wish I had had a t ape recor der in my he ad. The choir was singing the m ost m agnificent mass I had ever hear d. I could clear ly dist inguish t hat it was s ometimes in eight-part harm ony. It was all in Latin, and it was defi nitely no t any mass th at I have sung or hea rd. This went on for a long time, the whole rest of the ri de. I don't recollect it ending, b ut we did arrive at our des tination. T his was t he last ti me I ever hear d from Evec. I ha d the feeling we had accomplished all we could together. He had not been seek These two events i n 1987, Polly's vi sitations by the b lack-robed beings and the recurrent telepathic conversations with Evec, m arked the onset of what would prove to be frequent UFO and alien-rel ated a ctivities in her family's lives. It seemed to focus on Polly and her youngest child, Sam. A few months after Evec's last comm unication, Sam had an encounter that paralleled Polly's experience with the bl ack-robed beings. At age six, he s aw \"black figures flying about the room.\" Although they wer e similar to the beings Polly had witnessed, Sam des cribed these charact ers as \"s moke-like\" with r ed eyes. They told him, Com e with us, we'll take you to a better place. But Sam wasn't convi nced of their good intentions, a nd even though he was quite young he refused the off er. \"No way, \" he r eplied, \"I'm not goi ng anywhe re wi th you gu ys!\" After this incident both he and Polly had a number o f experiences involving UFO 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"sight ings, mainly witness ed from a nearby hill, and a seri es of the \"viv id dr eam \" events that indicated repeated alien e ncounters. \"We've seen m any U FOs w ith colored lights around them or shooti ng out from them,\" she s aid, reporting that it wa s \"common to see whit e central l ights flash amber, red, and blue.\" This was also the onset of several experiences with w hat Polly and her family referred to as t he \" Elves.\" T hes e beings, she said, \"w oul d squeak-talk very loud at night\" and were extremely frightening to another of h er children w ho a lso w itnessed s ome o f this activity during the m ost intense period of activity in 1989 and 1990. Around thi s same ti me, in Septem ber 1989, Polly's f amily also ha d an experience w ith a different sort of cr eature. They perc eived it as \"s loshing\" t hrough s olid matter, moving \"through physic al obj ects as if they wer e water.\" In spite of no clear conf rontation wi th this being, Polly felt that it was \"reptilian, huge and loud, \" making \" cras hing s ounds i n the woods like some very large two-legged creature lumbering through the woods in a very wet area. This sound had n o approach and no departure,\" she said, \"but there w as the definit e sense that the perpetrator of all this noise was approaching us. This occurred on a night w hich included a lot of UFO activity. We witnessed U FOs apparently pursued by fighter-reconnai sance at the ai r base.\" Polly, Sam, and others in her family have had a number of UFO sightings, not only from the hil l but also from other par ts of the area. In June 1993, for instance, while Sam was traveling in a car driven by a family friend, he wat ched t hree UFO s cavort in the sky. \"Sam s aw three br ight UFO s,\" Polly re late d. \"A bright light suddenly appeared high above and a li ttle ahead of them. It moved qui ckly downw ard, then disappea red as suddenly as i t had appeared. T hen a second appeared suddenly with no gradual approach, t o the left of w here the first one had, then z oomed across the sk y to the ri gh t a nd dis appear ed.\" Shortly after this, the car tu rned onto another st reet, and Sam watched a thir d light appear s uddenly. It flew a s hort distance and then we nt ou t of sight. Within a matter of a few weeks, Sam had anot her sighting, this time of three UFOs together. And the f ollowing month, after yet another impressive si ghti ng, Sam wrote me himself about what he'd s een on the night of August 19. \"Last night was awes om e f or UFOs,\" his account began. \"I saw on e triangle-s haped one which made a whooshing sound for a l ong ti me. It looked l ike i t might have been similar to t he t riangul ar one sighted in Belgium in 1988 or 1989. We saw it on TV. The one I saw w as flying low....I had hear d a whoos hing nois e fir st.\" Another i mpressi ve sighting o ccurred on August 30, in the same area of the previous sighting. Sam said that this o ne was a la rge di amond or tri angu lar sh ape with blinking lights on the front and rear. \"It looked to be real ly high,\" he said, \" but I could still see it good. I could see soli d matter i nside the light patte rn\" as the UFO ar ced ac ros s the sky. Alien contacts contin ued to occur, usually recall ed the m orning after the event as both dream-like a nd yet real. \"Sam told me of an abduction dream which h e found frightening,\" Polly wrote in December 1992, \" and this is unusual for him, as he is the only 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"one of my children w ho seems to seek them and even to m iss them.

He said he felt it was 'a bles sing' that he was a ble, briefly, to see out.\" Sam al so sai d he sensed hav ing had cont act at some point w ith \"bad aliens w ho are red, not gray,\" tacitly identifying the ones he had otherwise r emembered as Grays, the same sort of fi gure so many ot her abductees hav e r eported. Even more disturbi ng for Sam, however, was a dream he reported to Polly on the night of M arch 3, 1993. \"Sam just took me aside,\" Polly wrote, \"to tell me about a dream he had last night. He sai d, 'C an I tal k to you in priv ate? It's personal.' He has a partial m emory of this dream, or el se the dream i tsel f was a fragment. He was with s ome people approac hing the entrance to a UFO. He went through an entry way which led to a place that w as all white, b ut h e commented, 'You know how sci entists say dogs are colorblind to our colors? I felt like maybe I was c olorblind to their (ETs) colors and it wasn't really all white.' \"He said he was in a line with other people and t he person i n front of him w as older than he. This young m an pr oceeded int o the craft and appr oached a long , w hite t ube. He put his penis into the tube. A fter a little while he apparently w ithdrew it and left by some way other than the entrance. Sam wa s next. He d id the same thing w ith the tube as the man b efore him had done, but his memory ends at this p oint. He felt this had something to do with the aliens wanting sperm. He said there was no sound and he d i d not see any ali ens. He kept aski ng me for re assu rance , saying , 'That was just a dream, right, M om?' \"He does not read adult lev el books and I had n ever m entioned the sexual intrusions to him. It seems that just in the past yea r his exper iences hav e bec ome less agr eeabl e to hi m. P reviousl y he w as the one of my children who seemed to feel a need and desire for 'them.' That is not completely gone, but c ertainly some intrusive elements have been introduced. D amn it, K arla, something i s sexually m olesting my eleven-year-old boy!\" After pondering on the situation a while, Polly c ommented, \"I think the motive is not sperm gathering, but control . What affects the de pths of the human psyche more than issues related to our sexuality? It is a perhap s unadmi rable fact that sexual ident ity is probabl y the deepest , most pri mitive, most p owerful identi ty concept that a human being has. Violate sexual identity in a si tuation w her e the human is m ade to believe that he/she is totally power less , and you have gained a measure of control probably unattainable by any ot her single act. \" Like Polly, I was concerned about Sam's d iscomfort with this scenario, and its implications. I was also fascinated by his st atement that he had not s een any aliens in the experience. Later, Sam e xpanded this thought on a ta ped conv ersatio n he and 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Polly sent m e. \"In UFO dreams,\" he said, \"after I've done w hat they make me do, they don't let me see the m.

I'm not sure if t hey're humans.\" Polly also had a number of abduction or UFO dream-events which felt extremely real to her and sometimes included human-looking figures. M any of the detai ls, some of which will be described below, ar e am az ingly similar to cases I've in vestigated and w hich other res earc hers and abductees hav e consistently reported. S he al so occasionally found typical marks on her body, alt hough wit hout any m emory of getting them, including \"IV-type bruises\" on the bend of her arm and \"bruises in a triangular p attern\" on her upper arm. Polly 's abduct ion dr eams bec ame s o frequent and realistic in their details as well as in thei r effects upon her that in 1991 she began keeping a journal of the dreams and of actual UF O sightings, from which the f ollowing excerpts are taken. \"August 31, 1991. I was wit h a group of people in a light co lored r oom , and alie ns wer e testing u s for AIDS. I was found to have so me strain of it , but they seemed t o be communicating to m e that it would not kill me or even seriously harm me. I don't know if this was bec ause of something t hey did. Ot hers had i t as well -many of us were in the same situation. I t hink communi cation was telep athic . \"One thing that has charac terized my UFO dreams has been an intense feeling of Wow, this is really This is the real thingl Thi s is really happening. Typically I am out of doors and I see a UFO or UFOs in the sky. They land or one hover s above m e. When I felt the dizzying sense o f s piraling u pward [in a p revious e vent s he had describe d], that one was different because I w as conscious of being in my bed and being spun and s ucked upward into a UFO. I think my mind was sucked out of my body.\" Quest ioning the 'r eality' of t his dream about A IDS , Polly noted that sh e had i n fact been diagnosed with lupus erythem atosis, an auto-immune disorder, during he r teen years. \"October 19, 1991. I remem ber a dream of a week or s o ago wh ich in volv ed aliens. I recollect exiting a craft with them. I remember fl ying before we landed. Ther e w ere other humans on board. Some of us went up front, but on the lower level the underside w as clear-not glass but something thick yet perfectly clear. We could see down to a spread-out village below. It was daylight . The landscape below was f airly f lat, m aybe some low hills off to our left beyond the village. We lande d, and I remember that I and others exited the craft wi th the alie ns, whose form was like a very simplified human form-no muscle development evident.

I was in so me sort of medical situation in which my head was the object of attention. There w ere do ctors arou nd m e.

Then t hey wer e going to put long needle-like th ings in the sides of my head, and I remember thinking in my dream, When the aliens do this it doesn't hurt; it is just pressure.

We waved our arms to dr aw attention, and the clearest one began coming nearer. I was thinki ng, They are going to take us; how am I going to deal with thi s? And then it was like the atmosphere of my mind changed. I was suddenly i n a state of mind w her e I could handle this, not go into some kind of fear- shock at the absolute strangeness of it. 'The UFO was sort of grayish, not all lit, and some a liens approached us, also grayish. They were not human looking.

[Rec ounting an actual ev ent that preceded the dream] m y son Sam and I felt compelled to go up on the hill at 10:30 p.m. as there was a glow in the sky whi ch we felt must be from the sun, as it is not much after the longest day in this north country. When we got up there we felt intensely peaceful . Ev erything wa s very, very still, alt hough t her e is often a wi nd up there w hen there is none anywhere e lse. There were a few fireflies.

It was like being sucked by force, a dizzying, blinding, o verwh elming force . While it was happening I felt i ntensely that the experience was absolutely real, and in most dreams it never occurs to me to pass judgment on the reality of anything. I was sort of afraid, totally cau ght up in it (liter ally and f iguratively), very aware of the sense that it w as real, and feeling, Well, I' m in it now, so whe rever I am going i t is not under m y control .' I couldn't see much, but I felt such an incredib le f eeling of being lifted hig her and hi gher, li ke it took my mi nd. \"After the lift ing I was awar e of being i n a w hite place, but it was not the standard 'round ' wh ite roo m of man y UFO r epo rts. I th ink it was white like white p aint, and I recollect a corner, which is also no t typical, and some sort of black or d ark object. It was like I was seeing only one little part of this place. \"Another thing I recollect was being in some sort of cra ft and being behind the pilot, who sat on t he left side, and notic ing his head. It was hairless, apparently w ith a skull similar to ours, and the skin was white like putty. He turned toward m e and appeared to have on some so rt of clown mask , al though it did not r eall y look like our typi cal clow ns. It had the color orange on it and was otherwise whi te like plasti c.

It was light, like day light (wher eas I had been abducted in the da rk of night). I coul d see a building, I think with a flat roof, and an o utdoor area to my right of the building. I also v aguely recollect at some point desiring t o see m ore clearly and 'the m' doing something so that I could, and things came into better focus. In the outdoor area bes ide the building t here were flowers and shrubs and c hildren playing, hum an childr en. 'The pilot was still with me when I found myself inside the building. He said they call us something like 'the s hort round ones ' and showed m e models of h umans between three and four feet tall. These models looked to be m ade out of hard plastic or somethi ng similar and were or ange and white. I p ointed out to the pilot th at I was ex actl y hi s height (5'7\"). He was thinner built than a human man, maybe a little lighter w eight than I, though I am s mall-boned. A few other aliens were present, al so. \"In this building were some hum an c hildr en.

The aliens did not look like what I would hav e depict ed if you had said, 'Dr aw a ty pic al a lien.'

That is w hy I could get so close to that one without having to become engulfed by his eyes, and it is why they stood so obligingl y in that li ttle group!\" Polly and Sam reported these and a number of o ther expe riences for almost a year, many of which seemed to be reflections or memo ries of fairly current experiences.

'The ar ea of my psy chology which I feel has b een m ost damaged by 'them' or by some very early inf luenc e,\" she confided, \"is the area of my sexual c oncepts. At approximately age four, I bec ame obsessed with sadomasochistic sexual imagery. The images involved a li ttle girl on a flat table similar to a d octor's exam tabl e, but I thi nk it may have been m etallic lo oking, silver metallic, a li ttle grayer than actual silver. I remember bein g ob sessed w ith thes e images day in and day out, and I would try t o detach from them by saying that the little girl was not me, but yet at the same time I knew it was. \"Someti mes there would be one 'person' doing things to the little girl and sometimes several. There were generally those who obs erved. I had the sense of b oth males and females present. Occasionally a femal e would do a procedure, but more often a male.\" There wer e machines involv ed, as well as probes a nd needles. 'The intrusions involved what I now under stand to be the genital area, but I did not understand at the t ime, as we ll as the r ectum .

Everythi ng i s going as planned. But the plan di d not p rove benevolent toward me!\" The overall discernible effects of all thei r e xperiences on Polly and Sam, to this point, are several . Sam has an ov erly ma ture outlo ok fo r his a ge, evincing an interest in questions of cosmic importance including reincarnation and the history of the human race. And, after t he sperm-t aking sce nario, he is also, according to Polly, very uncomfortable with the idea of alien intrusions upon his devel oping sexuali ty. For P olly, too, the sexual aspects o f h er life h ave b een altered by these events. She avoids sexual involvements now, in an attempt to regain control over the compuls ions that have caused many problems for her in the past. 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" She has no explanati on for the a lien intrusions into her family's life, only a strong sense that this involvement has been with her fo r a very long time.

In addi tion, or as part of t he UFO events, Poll y has experi enced i nternal communic ations from \"spirits,\" although she cannot identify them more specifically. \"They so often enter or I enter them in a s ense,\" s he expla ined, \"in a sense in whic h we each or all allow each other to be there simu ltaneously. I don't know if this is a U FO thing, but they are m ulti-dimensionals.\" Her experiences comprise many elements: UFO sightings, entity enc ounters, dream- events, physical effects, spi ritual teachi ngs, and a sense of an u nknown m ission she must perform. In their experienc es, Polly and Sam have both felt positive a nd negati ve presences, fell owship and fright, which makes it hard to plac e all of t he ev ents into a single framework, the acts of a single group. There is a lso t he question of human involvement, since both of them report en counters with humanoid fi gures that have not yet been c learly dis cerned or ident ified.

A thi rty-five-year-ol d wife and mother of two chi ldren, Li sa a nd her hus band N eal have lived in sout her n Alabam a for the past fifte en years. H er medium build and thick brown hair reflect her ancestry of Italian and Scotch-Irish. To all outward a ppearances, Lisa's life seems quite normal. While her husband works at a go od job in heavy indus try, Lisa takes care of her home and children, invo lved in the us ua l ac tivities of a family with teenagers, and she enjoys gardening as w ell as more strenuous outdoor a ctivity. I met Lisa and Neal while I was in Florida to give a p resentation on abduction research. Several of the local UFO grou p's me mbe rs invited me to one of thei r h omes for a more inf ormal and int imate dis cussion, and when I described a few of the less well-known events some abductees have r eported, Lisa s uddenly became very interes ted. W e sp oke privat ely, and she told m e that some of the things I had just discussed w ere familiar to her , from her ow n e xper ienc es. Lis a had some conscious memories of encounters with the typical Grays, as well as missing-t ime episodes, multiple-witne ssed UFO sigh tings, unexplained body marks, telepathic communications from unseen s ources, and many dream- mem ories of am biguous reality - except in those instances where other evi denc e pointed to an actual event. While the details of Lisa's lif e-long inv olvem ent a re certainly very typical, the a lien intrusions a re clear ly more intense and freq uent than in m any s uch cases. Equall y intense ar e her em otional reac tions to thes e encounters and her nee d for help in coping with t hem. \"Meeting other abductees has helped me feel not so is olated, \" she w rote m e shortly after that first meeting, \"but my depression is still severe. I can't b elieve I have them [alien int eractions] s o frequent ly. I f they're trying to wear me down, they 've about succeeded. The f lashbacks just don't yet make sense, or maybe they have no intentions to. I'm st art ing t o ha ve military flashbacks, and my phone clicks and g oes crazy. The 'Morse code' and humming in m y ear ha s liter ally driven me up the wall.... I don't want to be used for experiments or reproductions, but how do I s top them ? I pr ay u ntil sometimes I'm prayed out. Why won't God help? By the way, I don't feel special o r ch osen like they said.\" I began m y investigation with Lisa by as king about any unusual ch ildhood events. Her responses show ed a pattern of acti vity going ba ck as f ar as she c an remember. \"The sounds of things w alking t hrough the house,\" she said, \"h ave been going on s inc e I was sm all. The s hadows [dim ly disc ernible f igures] happened more in my later life, from twen ty years old on. Like I said, they do it [appear] right in f ron t of m e.\" Sh e als o recalled episodes of missing time in childhood. \"I w ould go to the w oods-we owned 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"twenty-five acres when I was a child-and c ome back, and it would be dark.\" And the m issing-time experiences still occur. \"Now, I'll look at the clock and roll over and look at it again, and someti mes it will be an hour later and o ther times four hours,\" she explained, \"and I could swear it hadn't been but a few minutes. It makes me disoriented after I realize there's been some missing time . It's hard to go on when s omething robs you of your life, and you have no memory of it. \"The Gray s appeared about t hree or four years ago,\" she continued. \"Before that, I didn't know w hat was causing these things, but the shadow s I've seen f orever, seems like.\" In 1980, however , Lisa did see som ething ver y different fro m the shadows, in a te rrifying event. \"A being appear ed t o m e,\" she r ecalled, \"when I was a c ouple of weeks pregnant. We had just got into bed and Neal alr eady seem ed 'out of it, ' and t he being appeared on the en d of the bed, s quatting, tellin g me mentally the child I was ca rrying was special a nd it would be a boy. I almost had a faint ing s pell. I threw t he covers over my head as the being was leaping toward m e, I believe, and said, 'In Jesus' name, take it away! ' It disappear ed, and I fell quick ly asleep. It was about three feet tall, dark- skinned, leathery looking. I don't remember any thing else.\" The child, incident ally, did turn out to be a boy. N ow in his teens, he has proven to be ex traordinarily intelligent, with an IQ that tested above 140 when he was seven. A fter going through Lisa's early memories, I asked her to fill out a preli minary questi onnai re which focused on a number of events most ofte n reported by abductees . A comprehensi ve comparative chart of the respon ses to this qu estionnaire by all ei ght women is presented on p. 231. Because Lisa's experiences are so very typical, however, m any of her responses w ill be discussed here in some detail, as representative of repor ts from numerous abduct ees. She had already ment ioned a coupl e of these t hings-the odd phone d isturbances, the beeping and humming sounds in her ear - and there wer e other d etails, internal and exter nal, which are of ten part of the alien a bduct ion phe nom enon. For instance, there were sight ings of unexpla ined lights, within the house as well as in the sky. Lisa d escribed \"large whitish-yellow lights in the sky that blink out like a light switch and fast-moving streaks of light.\" She has also wi tnessed \"large and smal l balls of red or w hite light bouncing in the house\" and blue, or an ge, and white lights floo ding in through the w indows from craft outside. A couple of passages f rom her journal show some of these typical events: \"August 10,1993. When I got r eady t o go t o slee p at 11:30 or so, my cat noticed it, then I did - a small ball o f light bouncing through the room. It was just z ipping around. I probabl y saw it for fi fteen seconds, then i t we nt out of the room. In the morni ng my eyes were burning and irrit ated.\" \"August 24, 1993. W oke at 1 a.m., felt something was happening, looked around the room, fell back asleep. Wok e up at 4:25 a. m. with white lights t urning, like strobe lights, out side of my bedroom wi ndow. Bef ore I could r ace to the window, it was g one. My eyelids were very swollen in t he morning, and al so my back hurts.\" 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" \"March 27, 1993. Felt uneasy, like having a nightmare, struggling an d thrashing about, and then feeling sort of paralyzed. I felt the need to scream and resist, and I yelled, 'No!' two o r thre e ti mes .

When I looked ar ound t he room, a reddish-orange light flashed in the h ouse and then went to the side and it seemed white. This was a bout 1:00 to 1:20 a.m.\" Another common report involv es bizarre, unexplain ed behav ior of electrical equipment in the abductee's environm ent, and, as an excerpt from L isa's journal shows, this has also frequentl y occurred wit h her and Ne al. \"At about 3 a.m. my husband and I were waked up by the r adio goi ng cra zy, the fron t porch light blinking, and the touch- light lamp in the living room o n bright.\" Even the phone began to act oddly, ringing and crackling incessantly w ith no one on the other end of the line. \"Finally we just had to unplug t he phone,\" her journal noted. \"I was scar ed.\" This was not an isolated ev ent, as other entries in he r journal show : \"May 10, 1993. About midnight or so, the k ids' radi o came on and the lamp in the liv ing room came on twice. Neal and I h ad disturbed sleep.\" Unexplained activi ty of helicopte rs over the home, following, as it does so often after UFO activ ity, shows up in Lisa's case. For he r, i t began in early 1993, as her journal notes. \"March 15, 1993. About 12:20 or 12:30 a.m. I saw s ome beautiful blue light s coming down the hallway [through a window f rom a cr aft n ear t he hous e], t hen somewhere around that time I heard a helicopter over our house by my bedroom window. It stayed for a while, then left. It appeared on the scene moments a fter the craft w as leaving. C ouldn 't sl eep rest of the n ight.\" \"May 29, 1993. At 3: 30 p.m. my son and I saw a dark he licopter pas s o ver our hous e.\" \"September 22, 1993. Helicopters were still flying at 11 p.m. The humming an d 'Mors e code' were almost deafening again.\" \"September 23, 1993. Went to bed about 11:30.

She w as a w hite w oman, probably in her forties. Al so, someti me d uring the night a helicopter was flying close to our house, but I couldn't get up and fell back asleep. So t ired in the morning.\" Lisa has many of the symptoms typi call y repo rted by other abductee s, including stress, sleep disr upt ion, depr essi on, a sense of havi ng a job or task to p erfo rm, disturbing dreams of massive UFO landings and of w idespread disasters. 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" \"I feel they have said they love me and that I was special (yea h, sur e), and t hey s ay t hat I will be used for some purpose,\" Lisa commente d. \"P robably to tell ot hers about them.

I t old someone, 'They'r e finally com ing'.\" Among the events of actual abduction scenarios-whether recalled consciously, in flashbacks, or in m emories s urfac ing in dr eams - L isa's e xperiences include almost every type of repo rted event. Most women, f or instance, have undergone physical , speci fically gynecological , examinatio ns while in the hands of the aliens.

I can't remember more after looki ng a t the Gray.\" On another occasion, Lisa remembers being less c ooperativ e during an exam, \"giving them a hard t ime about being examined. I remember as king t hem, ' How would you like me to do this to you?' I don't know what they said...I'm sure they sedated me.\" T he following morning, s he s uffer ed from a s ore c hin and a br uis e on the t op of her right wr ist. A journal entry from July 1993 shows how d isturbed she has felt during some of these examinations. \"Had a 'dream' of being on their spaceship in a huge room on a tabl e with the Old One e xamining me,\" she noted. \" I was fine until he s howed me an instru ment (I can't re membe r it now) h e was goi ng to use on me . Then I got upset. He placed his hands on my head, and I don't remember a nything else.\" Lisa also recalls, more than once, being shown a lien or \"hybrid\" babies. An entry from October 1993 states, \"I gave bi rth to a fai r-looking baby and called it a star baby. It had real light blue eyes with unusual pupils.\" One of the most com monly reported ev ents is that of an ali en's face up very cl ose to the abductee's face. S ome researchers, taking their cue from abductees' descriptions of this event, call it a \"mind-scan,\" an d whatever else this activity does, it cer tainly seems to control the abductee mentally. Lisa remember s this occurring on several occasions. 'The ET s like to put their nos es almost on my nose,\" she expla ined, \"and w hen they do this I just stare into their eyes. S ometimes that's all I ever see, their ey es, an d not hing els e that's happening.\" Besides being told by the aliens that she is \"special\" and \"chosen,\" as often happens 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"with others, Lisa has also rec alled scenarios of training or i nstruction. In a November 1993 dream, for example, she w as in a b rightly lit room talking w ith some p eople whose identi ty she can't recall. They we re telli ng Lisa how she s hould go about discussing the aliens with other people. \"I was being told I needed to learn be tter how t o speak about them, \" she s aid. And she has been gi ven informati on about the al iens' i nteres t in human ge neti cs, another common communication. Two entries from her journal typify this event. \"August 16, 1993. In one 'dream' Neal and I were raising w eird creatures, an d a nother [part] was where they [aliens] were telling me how they have been genetically altering us gradually. I felt like we were t heir pet project or something.\" \"August 20, 1993. Woke at 2 a. m. and at 4:53 a.m., g ot up and went to kitchen for something to eat. H ad a 'dream' of an ape or goril la, whatever you want to call them, sitting on my bed holding my hands, and s omeone was saying, They are you and you are them . Very nauseated in t he m orning and h ad s weat ed ver y badly last night.\" Other, m ore specific, physical effects have also been report ed in Lis a's exper ienc es. In addition to the nausea and eye irritations that she suffered after ce rtain abducti ons or abduction 'dr eams, ' Lisa has also found patterns of brui ses, and puncture marks t hat couldn't be accounted for in any mundane way. She has the well-known scoop marks, for example, one on her lower right leg and another on the upper part of her right arm, wh ich ar e permanent. T emporary marks , however, are much more commonly reported. In Lisa's case, these have included a tri angle of ci rcul ar brui ses on her hip-the triangl e pattern show s up more frequently than any other des ign-s catt ered br uises on other body parts, such as the bridge of the nose; t he bottom, top, and heel of the foot; the wris t; insi de the arm very close to the armpit; all around the k nee; and on top of the h and. But bruises aren't the only m arks that show up. Like Polly a nd others, Lisa has found damaged areas in t he bend of her elbow and s cratches , which s he is cert ain were n ot accidentall y inflicted, in unusual p laces . After on e p articular a bduction in O ctober 1993, in which she recalled being in a pool of water with t he a liens arou nd her bef ore th ey took her to an examination room, Lisa found a scratch across her l ower left jaw, as well as two bruises on the outside of h er left knee. And she has had patterns of brui ses w hich are so commonly reported that we hav e come t o refer to them as \"clamp marks\" because they appear to have been left by either three - or four-f ingered hands grasping the upper arms or the thighs v ery forcefully. All of thes e phys ical effect s ar e v ery familia r in abducti on reports, as are instances of blood found on the abductee's body or bedc lothes after an encounter. Li sa, too, has had this occur, in situations where the blood could not be explained as coming from a bloody nose or so me ot her inj ury. It i s clear, then, that Lisa's abduction si tuation ha s involv ed m ost of the \"typical\" scenarios and events, ev en includ ing epis odes whe re s he has bee n shown h ow to operate a craft 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"and has been warned about the p hysical dangers of touching a craft during certain phases of operation. But she has also experienced several of the less familiar events - less familiar, that is, in t erm s of abducti on resear ch findings which have been made pub lic. R egret tabl y, much of what abductees have reported has not been publicized, for a number of reasons. In some cases, as with alien-hum an sexual activ ity, this may be becaus e so many ab ductees ar e unw illing to talk about su ch intimate things. In o ther case s it i s the re searche rs th emsel ves who a re reluctant to expose some aspects o f the e vents, fear ing they will push the cr edibility of their audi ence, especially their desired audience of professionals and academics, too far. Some parts of this phenomenon, they fear, are si mply not \"politically\" acceptable, no m atter what the abductees themselves insist they have experienced. Lisa and several other of the women whose experi ences are r eported in this book, theref ore, ar e t o be comm en ded f or their c ourage in dis cussing t hese as pect s. The first hi ghly controversial area is that of sexual a ctivity. It is important to remember, when reading the foll owing journal entries, that the aliens have superb \"virtual reality\" capabilitie s and that without ex ter nal veri ficati on i t is impossibl e to know if the m emory or dream of an encounter refl ec ts an actual e vent. This is es pecially important w hen assessing reports of sexual acti vity wi th the aliens, for i n some s ituations peop le t ell of seeing celebrities, religious figures, and even de ad acqua intan ces. One of the first sexual situations Lisa remembers happened in late 1989, beginning with her conscious awareness of the aliens ' presenc e. Lying in be d, she w oke up an d saw a group of aliens, on e of which held a wand-lik e instr ume nt, around the b ed. Th e tallest of the beings was touching Neal's chest. \"I look ed at them,\" Lisa explained, \"and tol d them not to t ouc h him and to leave him alone. That's the night I got to s ee them for a few seconds in an unaltered state. Then t hey pointed the wand at my forehead, made me feel dizzy, and I wa s out. I be lieve tha t's the nigh t th ey m ade me hav e sex while they wat ched.\" The sexual interaction inv olved another abductee. L isa said the m an gave her his name, T. M. Reiss, which he spelled for her. \"H e told me they had be en abducting him since he was a child,\" she said. \"He w as very sorry.\" In a couple of the s exual sc enarios, Lis a re called interacting with cr eatu res of so me sort. These types of b izarre repor ts turn up less frequently in the research, but they are not unhear d o f. She r ecalle d t he f irst episod e as a d ream-even t, in w hich s he and a gor illa- type creature were s exually engaged. Lis a wok e up a fter having this 'dream' when the sound of a \"breathing device\" brought her to consciousness. She saw a dim figure in the doo rway step ou t of sigh t and then, as unlik ely as such a response always seems in these situations, she went back to sleep. The action, h owever, was not yet over. At 3:25 she wo ke up again, flinging her arms about and trying to rouse N eal, w ho was completely unresponsive. She saw a li ghted object outside the bedroom window, and she could feel an ener gy c ontr olling her body. 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"'They ha d s ome force on me ,\" she sa id, \"s toppi ng me from getti ng up. When the craft [outside] started to lift up, it broke the force. I ran o utside , bu t I rea lly can' t say fo r su re i f I saw some thing .\" On anot her occ asion, while ly ing down du ring the d ay, Lisa dream ed about a number of sexual situations. Something like a small horse was involved, a s well as a \"dolphin,\" some G rays, and \"a dark, leat hery, scaly creatur e\" wh ose features she couldn't clearly recall. After waking from this dream, Lisa experienced the \"hummi ng and Morse code\" noise that occasionall y plag ued her int ernal hear ing. After a similar ' dream' in whic h Lis a was plac ed wit h se ver al an ima ls in sexual sit uations while being observed, she awoke the next m orning w ith a bruise on her lower ankl e and a tender area on the back of her head, in spite of no consciously recalled injuries to t hese areas. And immediately follo wing another dream-like s exual e pisode w ith w hat appeared t o be a well-k nown public figur e, Lisa awoke in her bed and s aw a nebulous form move quickly ac ross the room and disappea r. Startled and frig htened, i t took her a long time to fall back asleep, and in the morning she f elt naus eated. Such t hings m ade it har d for her to dismiss all t hes e dr eam m emories as mer e figm ents, yet they were such scant evidence as to give no certainty of the e vents' reality. Whether they w ere real or dreams, there is the question of moti vation. \"I believe sometimes I'm made to dream odd things ,\" Lisa said, \"to see m y reaction to them.\" A poignant journal e ntry reveals how confusing this acti vity can be , ho w vulnerable it leaves the abductee. \"Dreamed Neal and I made love ,\" she noted. \"I hope it w as hi m.\" The second controversial area reported by Lisa involves, as with t he c ase of Pat in the prev ious chapter, the view ing of \"new bodies .\" She told me that her memory of seei ng a new body oc curred someti me in late 1992. Although she was keeping a journal by that time, which rec orded UF O sightings, cons cious ev en ts, and dr eam s, bot h a lien- instigated and the normal , se lf-generated variety, she refused for some reason to inc lude t his ev ent in the rec ord. Lisa recalled lying on a tabl e aboard a craft, with her \"new body\" beside her. \"I got out of my old body,\" she said, \"and stood next to i t. I was looking it o ver, and I even looked at my teeth. The body was perfe ct, but i t had my l ong hai r that I used to have. S omebody said they could mak e people believ e that wa s m e,\" she c ont inu ed, \"even though it was perfect and with long hair. I want ed so badl y to get in it, but I did not . I don't remember wh o the beings w ere in the room with me, just bei ng overw hel med seei ng the body. I don't remember how I got bac k in m y old body.\" Lat er, i n 1993 , Li sa had ex per ienced ano ther dream -event about this s ituation . \"Dreamed of showing my new body to some friends,\" her journal r ecords, \"and reading to the m from a sp eci al boo k about hum ank ind. I was reading with som e clear instrum ent lik e a triangle. Don't rem ember what I w as reading.\" This scenario of reading a book duri ng an encounter, by the w ay, is a little-known detail reported in a number of separate cases. Similar dreams recurred in which she found herse lf displaying the new body. In one 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"brief ly recalled episode she w as showi ng i t to her doctor, and in a m uch m ore involved dream, Lisa felt as if she had actually died in order to get into the new body, w hich she then s howed to her husband and some other people. There w ere other details of this dream that suggest it may at t he very leas t hav e been a s creen memory of an actual event. She insisted on k eeping her son with her, for example, expl aining t o her hus band that the son \"is one of us, like me.\" Lis a had been told in a pa st encounter that the aliens were interested only in her and her son, not the entir e family. The encounter i n the new body was followed by a mo re fa mil iar si tua tion, in th e e xam room. \"A doctor and a nurse were giving me an ex amination,\" she re called, \"and telling me I had hepati tis. But they we re gi ving me some sort of vaginal exam. I told t hem to leave me alone, that they weren't my doctors , [but I] don't remember mor e.\" In addition to the sexual encounters and the a lleged cloning capabilities of the aliens, a third c ont roversial topic avoided by many resear chers focuses on militar y inv olvem ent w ith al ien s a nd abductees. Fo r Li sa, as i s so often the case with abductees, the first memory of a possi ble encounter w ith the military surfaced in a dream. \"I w as b eing interrogated b y the m ilitary,\" s he said, \"pushed and made to lie crouched on the ground. In the back were some trucks, and beside them were guys in black uniforms standing watc hing m e. The men asking questions were in regular mili tary clothes. They held me do wn with the butts of thei r guns. They told m e to give th em the knowledge, and they said ' at any cost.' I told them I did n't k now what they were talking about, and they just repeated t hemselves.\" Since that dream in August 1993, however, Lisa has h ad o ther m emories o f this particular 'event' come to the surface. The mo st detailed recollection came as part of a situation w hich closely fi ts the d efinition of the VRS dream di scusse d earlie r. On the ni ght of December 19, 1993, Li sa had seve ral d reams o f a very ordinary so rt. B ut in the mid st of the se regular dr eams, s he suddenly found her self in a situation and environment that had quit e a diff erent 'feel' to it. \"All of a sudden I'm surrounded by mil itary men, s ome in b lack clothes and some in green,\" she noted. \"I was being m ade t o wa lk hur riedly on the gr ound s of some installation. I don't know how I got there or l eft. Th e so ldiers were ru de to m e. I to ld th em to stop pushi ng on me. \"Then we went into an office of some type t hat see med plainly decor ated. It look ed lik e whit e walls and no pictur es, and the desk and chai r w ere pl ain. A m an was sitting behind the desk. H e w as a little heav y and look ed slightly bald ing, but his hair was short. H e had on gr een clothes and no medals or n ame as I could tell. He started asking me questi ons, about what I felt on the aliens. It seemed like he was wonder ing about how to get the public prepar ed. \"I told him that a lot of t he public was already aware, and so me would n ever accept it. I asked him how he could expect th at, since we don't al l agree on o ther things. We talked, I believe, a little about religion and politi cs. I believe there were othe r people in the r oom. 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"I probabl y wasn't allowed to look. 'Then I think they br ought m e somet hing to dr ink. I don 't remember more. I just know this man looked bewilder ed and c oncerned. I believe the alien iss ue h as gotten out of control in his opinion. I express ed to him tha t I wa s ti red of t he gam e-play ing.\" For Lisa, then, the abducti on phenomenon's p arameters include witnessed U FO sightings; consc ious perc ept ions of light s, probes, and aliens in t he house; conscious telepathic communication s; bizarre external physical reactions from inanimate o bjects in her environment; consc ious perception of m issing-time episodes; unexplained physical marks on her body; and a number of vi rtual-reality/dream s cenarios involving both human and ali en beings. In a nu tshell, thi s is an accurate general definition of the phenomenon as reported by numerous abductees. But as the eight representative accounts h ere de monstrate, the details of that scenar io are highly bizarre, variabl e to an absurd degree from case t o case, i nvariably i ntrusive, s ometimes p hysically pai nful , spi rituall y ambiguous, ingenious ly decept ive, and , a t every l evel , deepl y di sturbi ng. Three exp eriences Lisa has recently reported will m ake this point very clearly. The first, w hich she recalled in a dream state, began insi de an unknow n facili ty. \"I was on a table,\" Lisa sai d, \"and i t looked like I was being pushed d own a hall with bright lights. T hey [her attendants] were quickly strappin g my feet down wit h straps th at l ooked like v elcro. I don't k now what thes e bei ngs that abducted me looked like. Then something was inserted in m y left ear, I think. I told them they we re killing or hurting my brain, then I blac ked out.\" In the next remembered scene, something ve ry different was going on, thi s ti me involving other humans. \"I believe the FBI came to arrest m e,\" Li sa sa id, \"and they calle d me by my maiden name. One man w as really m ean to m e.\" Lisa remembered nothing more, but she wondered the next morning if t he soreness in her left ear and her throat had anything to do with the mem ory of th e ear probe. The second experience, which she recorded as a d ream, also involved some physical procedure aboard a craft, but it began on a rather exalted leve l. \"I dream ed I was given a heavenl y audi ence,\" Lisa r eport ed. \"I be lieve it meant that they [ aliens] inv ited m e to speak wi th them, but I don't re member about what.\" A physical exam followed. \"I saw myself on a table in a spaceship and alien being s s tanding at the e nd of my feet, telling me o r eac h o ther th at I w as a n excellent breeder,\" she recalled. \"A reptile-looking creat ure was gett ing on t op of me, I gues s to rape me.\" A fter this, she remembered nothing m ore. The final ex perience had a much more conscious el em ent to it than t he 'dr eam s/ in spite of its m ore 'fantastic' nature. Lis a had gone to bed early on th is n ight and awoke at 1:10 a.m. Preparing to fall asleep again, but still awake, she began t o feel a growing s ense of some \"pressu re\" whi ch be came very inten se. 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"\"I looked u p a t the ceiling ov er m e,\" L isa said, \"and saw ima ges that looked like vultures or the phoenix bird.

I st arted yelling frantically, 'Oh, God, oh, Heav enly Father! ' over and over and trying to get m yself free from the force. I fe lt my eyes roll ba ck in m y head. \"Then I felt a gr eat pulling, an d I'm not sure if I was i n spirit form or m y body , bu t ve ry quickly I w as in the clouds and sky. I looked dow n and saw the lights of a town and vapors of t he c louds. The spirit took me to a wall or some s ort of t unnel, and I was g oing to be taken in. I don't remember more of w hat I saw. The next thing I know, I was back in bed and looking at th e same birds disappearing. I came out of the odd st ate I was in and went to the kitchen, I was t rembling so bad. The clock said 3:40.\" \"God help m e,\" Lisa conclude d, \"whatever I w as seeing.\" The vulture and the phoenix, after all, are very different creatures who embody quite different c oncepts. A time los s of two and a half hours oc curred that ni ght. And so did a seriou s in jury to Lisa's back. The \"great pul ling\" that t ook h er upwards jerked her wit h such force that the next day s he could hardly walk. T he pain continued getting worse, and when she consulted her doctor, she w as told that the spinal damage could prove permanen t. In this one instance, at least, the event was m ore than virtual reality.   45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" V -- Anita Anita's experiences, while not so intens e or f requent as Lisa's, are probably more ak in t o what most abductees witness and recall. They include a n umber of details commonl y reported in other cases. But in her situa tion, typica l of these others, consci ous memori es of events hav e been less frequent and more mo de rate i n sco pe. H er a ttitu de similarly reflects thi s moderate quali ty, po ssibl y because she's been abl e to reflect upon her experi ences wi th quiet eq uanimi ty. Bor n in 1947, Anit a has s pent mo st of her life in Texas. Her ancestry is French, Scotch, and Native American. A wife, mother, and grandmother, she is a ttractive a nd intelligent. For a w hile, she was a trai ned vol unteer em ergency medic, and later she owned and operat ed her own business. From her h ome in a large central Texas city, Anita now takes car e of her f amily and also pur sues sev eral i ntellectual interests. In the past sever al year s, for ins tanc e, she has been dr awn t o a st udy of psychic and alternative methods of heali ng. Anita has been c onsciou sly aw are of UFO activity since childh ood, and her brothers and sisters have also had recurrent U FO events throughout their lives. So, perh aps, may have some of A nita's ch ildren and g randchildr en. Her fi rst conscious encoun ter with the unknown was at the age of five. \"I recall sitting in my front yard one af ternoon,\" she said, \"and s ens ing s omeo ne w atching me. I turned around, and back behind me s tood a man in a red flight suit. I have no m emory of what happened after that.\" Like many abductees, what she recal led from c hildhood was frequentl y unexplained, but not ne cessa rily related to U FOs . The nature of the events remained ambiguous. Episodes of missing ti me whi ch have recurred t hroughout her life began at an early age. She recalled one such episode that happened at the family home, w hich w as i n a very rural setting. \"I suddenly came o ut of what I call 'mind blank',\" Anita explained. \"I fo un d myself close to a creek near our house. I di d not know how I got there. The stran ges t thing was that I was coatless and shoeless, and it was mise rab ly cold outside.\" While these two events in isolation don't necessitate a UFO-based explanation, in the context of Anita's life-long experiences, they prov e to be very t ypical of abduction patterns. A nd the third consciously reme mbered event from her chil dhood d id bring UF Os int o the pict ure. \"When I w as twel ve,\" Anita reported, \"my brother s houted one night for me to come look out the window . I di d, and just above tree le vel , about a quarter of a m ile from our house, was a large band of b eautiful lights moving from west to east. They appear ed to be all on one craft. My brother was around ten at the time. He said it was a UFO. There was no sound, and we had our windows open.\" Anita and others in her family have continued to h ave UFO sigh tings from time to time. Her olde r brother, for instanc e, who is a long-distance tru ck d river, has reported a number of sightings especially in the southwest part of the country, although 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"elsewhere as well. \"He tell s of a ti me he and hi s wife had st opped on the highway, s omewher e up ar ou nd Nebraska, to ge t som e sleep,\" Anita relat ed. 'They were awak ened by a very bright light shining down on them. They got out to s ee what it was but coul dn't because the li ght blinded them. They said i t di dn't make any noise, and t hat is what frightened them. They jumped back in the truck and h eaded for Scott's Bl uff. Whatev er it w as followed them all the way .\" For Anit a, the strange exper ienc es continue d int o her ad ult hood. In the 1970s, she live d in H ouston for a while, and it was there that a number of events occurred. The most traum atic and t errifying was in 1972, when at age twen ty-five, A nita had her se cond enc ount er wit h the man in the red s uit. As in the i nitial meeting, this occurred in the day time while Anita was consc ious, but as in most abductions her s tate of mind was soon al tered as the strangers intruding into her home took control of the si tuation. S he was lying on the living room couch when she b ecame aware of presences there with her, and instantly her m ind was clouded. She saw a m an who appeare d \"human looking in ev ery way\" bending o ver her. \"I hav e never exper ienc ed s uch terr or in my li fe,\" Anita said. \"It was like a dream in that I knew the human was raping my body, but I did not feel a nything at all.\" The rapist had not come alone. \"I could see maybe three ot her s,\" An ita r eported, \"standing by the table, but i t w as like seeing them th rough frosted glass. I could make out their bodies and the red suits but could not really see any details.\" She has no idea, therefore, if the othe r figu res were hu man-looking, like the rapi st, or al ien. She does remember t hat aft er t he forced intercourse, the red-sui ted man spok e to her about something, but the on ly communication that stayed with her consciously w as his statem ent, I'll be there to help you. Anita does n't remember what may have happened after that, but as soon as s he was awar e that the men wer e go ne , she r eac ted in a v ery conscio us state of m ind. \"I was so terrified,\" she said, \"that I grabbed my children and got out of the house immediately.\" The trauma of the event had distur bing effects on Anita for a very long time. \"It is very embarrassing to say this,\" she confided, \"but after that experience I started w earing a tampon t went y-four hour s a da y so the y couldn' t do it again . As if tha t would stop the m.\" Not long after the assault, Ani ta experienced a r elocation event, presumably with the congr uent missing time. A t one moment, she was conscious of b eing in a certain location, and then at the next moment, without any sense of having lost consc ious ness, Anita found herself ret urni ng to awareness and bei ng in a di fferent place. \"I was on my way to the gr oc ery store,\" she re ca lled, \"and cam e to a st op si gn. There were no o ther ca rs in si ght in any direction. I started to turn the corner. The next thing I remember is snapping out of 'm ind blank ' and being [in a d iffe ren t lo cation ] o n W est Road. I looked in my rearvi ew mirror, and there wa s a car par ked o n the r oad that wa sn't ther e 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"when I had stopped at the sign moments befor e.\" Although the loc ation wa s differ ent, she did not notice a time l oss. In 1977, while still living north of the Houston area, Anita had a U FO sighting that w as witnessed by one of her friends. \"I was outside late one n ight t alking with a friend,\" she said, \"when I glanced up and saw a large orange globe to the north.\" H er friend, who was in his car, took off in pursuit of the object and repo rted on hi s re turn that he had eventually lost si ght of it near a state highway. It was als o during t his period that Anita had two o ther experiences that are frequently reported by abductees. One of these is the pres enc e of small lighted objects in the hom e, us ually near a wa ll or the c eiling, that seem to function as some sort of remot e probe or monit or. This f irst event occ urred dur ing the middle of the n ight, when something woke Anita. \"Looking around,\" s he recalled, \"I s aw a m ulticolored triangle m oving against my bedroom w all.\" S he could see that the obj ect had a devic e or des ign in its center, where pink, orange, and other colors were moving a round. Her reaction to this strange sight reflects a m addening yet typical response that abductee s repo rt in s uch situations. Instead of reacting with surprise , c uriosity, and even consternation, as w ould a person whose mind was not being controlled, her response was qui te passive . \"I thought, A mandala, how pretty,\" she sa id, \"the n I j ust went back to sleep.\" This i s appar ent ly a programmed res ponse that other abductees report, and it has proven usually to precede an encounter. If a nything else occurred that night with Anita, however, she had no m emory, consc ious or dream-like, of further activity. The other experi ence was much more physical and less direct ly tied to alien intrus ion. It has been reported, how ever, to oc cur following abduct ion events in a number of other people 's situa tions. Anita deve loped a r ash wh ich s eemed t o have no m undan e ca use. It rapidly c overed alm ost her entire body, and t he doctor she consulted could not give her an explanation. \"It looked like I had snake skin,\" she d escribed. \"It took six weeks to go away.\" The patter n of act ivity in Anit a's life th us far had show n occa sional intrusions and sight ings, but in t he l ate 19 80s the ac tivity notic eably began to increas e. The timing may not be acci dental , as m any abduc tees \"woke up\" to th e fac t of th eir encounters in 1986 -88. Although at the ti me Anita w asn 't aware of the i mplications, this new phase of her inv olvem ent m ay have been ma rked by a possible missing-fe tus episode in 1985. When she began experienci ng some suspicious physical sym ptoms, she consulted her doct or and was very surprised t o disc ov er she was pregnant. Havi ng already raised a family of three c hildr en, an d considering her age, she deci ded to te rmina te it. Bu t the resul ts of the operati on proved to be as s urprising as the unex pected pregnancy i tsel f. \"I went to hav e an abortion, \" she said, \"after my Ob-Gyn a ssured m e that I w as pregnant. He performed the procedure and said that he could not f ind any fetal tissue 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"at all. He was as puzzled as I w as.\" Whether this was one of the by-now familiar proced ure s of aliens implant ing a fetu s and t hen returning to retrieve it fr om the host m other, Anita h as not been able to determine. But since that epi sode and up until the present, there have been a number of experiences in w hich the aliens are clearly involved. She has seen the m in cons cio us glimpses and f lashbacks, an d rememb ered events in dreams. She h as engaged in telepathic communications with some group of ent ities, at times generated by them and at times by her. And, as usual , there have been per ipheral and confirming ex ternal evidence in some ins tances. Among the type s o f non-hu man enti ties A nita ha s enc ount ered are t he ub iquit ous G rays, another group she calls the 'Tans,\" a blue creature, and an off-white creature whose skin she descr ibed as \"dr y and l eathery,\" i n addi tion to the humanoids in the red s uits. Although she is co nscious of a single event i nvol ving the G ray s, A nita ca me aw ay f rom the experience with a definite idea about the creature's a ttitude toward her. \"As far as the G rays g o,\" s he said, \"I have only one memory of an encounter, and it w as not pleasant.\" In the s ketchy recollec tion, Anita was inside what appeared to be a ty pical craft. She was being escorted through a corridor, wi thout an y sense of the d estination or of any prec eding scenar io. \"There was the feeling of dis like on the pa rt of the one [a Gray] w ho was leading me dow n the corri dor,\" she recalled. \" I mean, he didn't like me or just didn't like humans. It was as if he had a somewhat di stasteful func tion to p erform. By the way,\" she added, \"this dude had a s hort, squatty-looking blue creature with him. I nicknamed him Gri mace.\" Like so many others in these situations, with no a ccurate, authoritative explanations or sources to help them understand the aliens and their activities, Anita has had to invent her own terms and phrases. The nickname abov e is one s uch e xam ple, as is the name \"Tan\" which she uses for a particular gr oup of ent ities. Des cribing t hes e s ame entities, other abductees hav e used any num ber of different nam es be cause no o ne nam e h as yet been establishe d as the proper one. Anita has recalled several encounters with the Tan group in the past few years. She said that they are very sim ilar in appearanc e to the creat ure in the d rawing on Whitley Strieber's COMMUNION, which, according to other abductees, is more lik e what they would call a Gray. But Anita clearly distingui shes b etween the gray creature that w as leading her down the corridor in one encounter, and the Tans, wi th w hom she is m ore familiar. \"When I first saw their picture on the book cover/' she said , \"I immediately thought, Hello, little friend. I know that for some reason I f eel pr otective of t hem.\" Her rel ationshi p w ith the Ta ns, un like her on e i mpersonal enc ounter with t he Gray, inv olves a different degree of int imac y, appar ent ly as part of t heir deliberate programm ing of the abductee. \"I hav e n ever sensed the dislike that I did with the Gray,\" Anita reported. \"[T he Tans] s eem to be very concerned with making us feel love for the m.\" 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" But Anita has proven to be quite aware of thi s psychol ogical mani pulation on the aliens' part and has thus be en able t o see thr ough s ome of their intentions or mo tivations. \"I recall one [Tan] looking into m y eyes,\" she described from an enc ounter, \"and making me feel extreme love from him. I put m y hands on his face and said, Too bad it isn't real , meani ng the feeli ng of love that he was pr oject ing into my soul.\" Indeed, in spi te of the aliens ' intentions to convey such a ca ring relatio nship, Ani ta h as continued to suffer m uch of the same an xiety that ot her abdu ctees report. \"When I said I felt p rote ctive towards the li ttle c ritters,\" she cautioned, \"please believ e that it is [a f eeling] induced by them. The rest of the time, all I f eel is apprehension during the day and dread of going to bed at night.\" This a nxiety very o ften causes d isruptions o f the abductee's sleep patterns, usually occ urring ni gh tly a t approximatel y the same time, as happens with Anit a. \"I do still get scar ed s ometim es,\" she c onfes sed, \" and I still wake up at 3:00 to 3:34 a. m. and huddle under the covers frightened and lie there with my eyes g lued to the bedroom door.\" This stress response, accord ing to mental health professionals who have studies such situations, show s up in cases where an act ual traumatic event has occurred. It may be that abduc tees continue to w ake up at a certain time each night because a traumati c event had occurred previously at that time, as if a preventat ive warning, a wak e-up-and- protect-yoursel f alarm, is sounding subconsci ousl y. The ongoing feelings of fear and intrusi on are f ostered not only by the consciously recalled encounters but also by situations in which external e vidence poi nts to unremembered events. For i nstance, without any c onsc ious memor ies of a disturba nce or problem asso ciated w ith the area, Anita has a phobia about driving alone along a certain s tretch o f U S H ighway 2 87. T here is, h owever, a p ossible connection w ith her alien involvement. \"This [stretch of highway] is where my older brother called us to look out the window one night,\" she said , \"to see a U FO goi ng over at treetop level.\" And although she remem bered nothing further ab ou t that night, her phobia about the area is s uspicious. So ar e t he v arious marks an d injuri es she has discovered o n h er b ody. \"Lots o f mornings,\" Anita said, \"I have gotten up feelin g like s omeone beat me u p in my sleep.\" This is another common abductee report, w aking u p w ith s ore, d amaged-feeling muscles and joints. \"I have waked up with bruises on my arms, shoul ders, and legs,\" she continued, \"with n o idea where they came from . I have found scratches t hat I could not remember hav ing gotten the day b efore.\" The evi dence for vi gorous ph ysi cal acti vity du rin g the night, although unremembered, comes from m ore than just Anita's sore or scarred body, however. In one inc ide nt, she woke up in the m orning a nd felt an unfamiliar pain in her right hand. \"\\ sat up i n bed,\" she explained, \"and f ound t hat s ometime dur ing t he night my ri ng had been squashed on my fi nger.\" S he managed wit h eff ort to remove the r ing , but neithe r her husband nor 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"a jeweler could comp letely restore i ts or iginal s hape. On anothe r occasi on , A nita go t out o f be d one m orni ng and found t he cr uc ifix fr om her necklace lying on the floor. \" It had been on my nec k the night b efore,\" she said, \"and the chain was still on [me]. But the only way to remove the crucifix is to remove the necklace and take i t off the chai n.\" She has also awakened several mornings to d iscover that something had happened to her clothing, a report fre quentl y echoed by other abductees. In one instance, she woke up with her nightie on backward, although she was certain she h ad not taken it off, turned it ar ound, and put it back on. A nd on a different occasion she found that the night ie was not only bac kwar d but had al so been turned in side-out. In the night dur ing one of these events, she had an altered-state ex per ience in which she recalled a gr oup of Tan aliens obser ving her as she was \"free-fa lling,\" an event which did not feel u nduly upsetting for some reaso n. Anita had quite a severe reaction to another s imilar event, however, venting much more emotion than t he situatio n seemed to call for. It wa s in the w inter, du ring the Christmas holidays one night, and she had wo rn socks to bed for extra warmth . When she woke up the next day and found that one of h er s ocks was missing, Anita became extremely upset and angry at her family. S he said she w as \"very belligerent\" toward them, even accused them of playing a practic al joke on her, one which didn't s trike her as humorous. Anita was also physically upset that morning, suffering fro m a violent headache and nausea which caused h er to v omit, y et there w as n o illness to account for the symptoms. Still, she might not have bee n overly co ncerned a bout the vanishe d so ck and her physi cal problems, i f her young granddaughter hadn't made a disturbing comment. The seven-year-ol d child tol d her grandm other that some \"mean men\" had come i n and taken her aw ay du ring the night. When Ani ta as ked her to d escribe the \"mean men,\" the l ittle girl called them \"the mushroom men.\" \"What are the mushroom men?\" Anit a asked, and h er granddaughter then found the book MISSING T IME by Budd Hopkins and pointed to the dr awing o n the cover. Anita asked the gi rl to make a dr awing of her own. It show ed a long-neck ed humanoid being with a head shaped like an inverted light bul b. The eyes were bl ack, large, and slanted, the nose had two nostril holes, the mouth was a st raight thin line, and the chin was more rounded than in the dr awing on the cover o f MISSING TIME. The girl said the creatures w ere about a foot tall, gray-ski nned and had four fingers r ather than five-a det ail not appar ent in the cover pictur e. T her e wer e qui te a few of these enti ties present, s he s aid. Anita remembered nothing st range that night herself, but the physical symptoms, the missing sock, and her granddau ghter's story w ere indicative enough of an intrusive incident to be of great concern. She not only w anted to know w hat had gone on during the night, but she wanted to know more in general about these beings who had been a part of her life for so long, so she decided to try meditating and sending out m essages to 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"the aliens. \"I would ask a question telepathically,\" A nita e xplained, \"and then li e down on the so fa to drift into twilight sleep, which is really just a deep state of r elaxation. I was not asleep or awake. Then the answers to m y questions would come.\" She remembers, for i nstance, asking, \"Why are you taking hum an women?\" To i nsure qual ity breedi ng, the ans wer c ame back. \"What about when a wo man is menstr uating?\" she inqui red, thi nking about how she had used a tampon to tr y to fen d off an y fu rther rape s in th e pa st. We know the di fference, she was told. \"When are you going to show yoursel ves?\" she questioned further, but the reply w as less than specific. The time is almost r ight , was a ll sh e rec eive d. Anita has used this medi tati ve method for communication several other times. \"When I decide to telepath to them,\" she commented, \"I spend a good part of the time berating them fo r not being honest wit h t he hum an r ace. They've always been her e. If they had shown themselves all along, no one would f ear them. It's th e unk nown t hat ca us es fear. No w they've m ade it impossible just to be accepted. I know who I'm yelling at,\" she added, \"but I have no idea w ho, which group, is sending back answers.\" And some of those answers have been impossible t o understand. In addition to the communications which made s ome sort of sense-it only works when the y ear ar rives and transm ogrify, for example-Anita has a lso gotten messages cont aining unk nown words and meaningless phras es, inc luding one puzzlin g r eference to star -planet fill. Some of these messages look like nonsense, but one of the other odd communications, IRU URI, is very similar to a message gi ven to Li sa, in which she w as told by the aliens, referring to some ape-type c reatures, They ar e you a nd you are t hem. If the capital letters in Anita's communi cati on ar e wri tten out as w ords, it would read, \"I are you, you are I.\" And the i mport of the ph rase s is clea rly si milar. Even the g rammar is incorrect in bo th ca ses. As with m ost abduc tees, Anita cannot explain e ven to herself just what the aliens are doing with her. And she certainly doesn't accept all the co mmunications and encounters as objecti vely real . \"I suspect that a lot of these encounter s are alien-induced dreams,\" she commented, \"for the purpose o f making you feel comfortable wi th them. As for the controlled free- falling, I think they were creating an enj oyable flying experience for me because I have a horror of flying and it may be necess ary in the future to 'fly' w ith them w hen the planet 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"tilts in order to save my life .\" Her reference to the planet tilting comes from a scenario she has been shown inv olvin g future global catastrophe. Such scenarios are so common among abduc tees that this type of i nformati on may w ell be part of t he widespread programming included in the alien agenda, designed to serve some purpose which is not yet clear. A nd most of the abductees who are told about a coming destructi on also report, as does Anit a, feeling that they will have a job or ta sk to perform in conjunction with this catastrophe. \"It is like I have always known that these things [UFOs, aliens, and the predicted destructi on] are c oming,\" Anita told me, \"and that I must tr y to convince people, and also learn things that would help not only with my own survival afterwards but I m ust also be able to hel p other survivors. For instance, I was told as a child, The children must be protected.\" Anita, then, admi ts that at l east part of the alien p rogramming has had an effect on her, but she doesn't let herself accept ev erything they tell her or s how her. \"I'm always amazed when I get any informati on from them at all,\" she said. \"I really don't know if s omeone who would abduct a person co uld be t rusted to give a truthful answer to any quest ion. \" She is aware of their possible deceptions, ju st a s she realizes that the aliens are capable of cr eat ing u nreal scenarios for hu mans during e ncoun ters. T his awareness has served Anita well, for it has allowed h er to push the alien activi ty away from her a little, as it were, in order to analyze and assess the events to which she has been subjected. A nd it also has kept her from ju mping to conclusions about so me of the things s he has remembered. One recent possible event, for in stance, Anita desc ribes as a regular dr eam, in spite of the presence of UFOs in the scenario. \"I dreamed last night t hat I w as standing in m y back yard and looking up into the night sky,\" she told me. \"1 saw a rectangular UFO si tting poised about f ive hundred feet abov e the hous e. It had rock ets on the side and started firing at a line of trees fairly close to the house. I ran i nside, and my doorbell rang.\" She said the next segment of the dream involved a scene in which she and I were together, discussing the book project, but after that a very differ ent episode o ccurred. \"Next,\" sh e said , \"I w as vi sited b y so me mili tary so rts w ho were try ing to ge t me to tell them about the U FOs, and I re fused . I kept sayi ng, 'I know nothing, I know nothing'.\" Anita dismissed this scenari o as a mundane d ream, which it may well have been, probably in part because of my presence i n one of the segmen ts. What she didn't know, however, was that I in fact had seen a rectangular UFO at very close range in the winter of 1992, so my own curiosi ty w as aroused by her descri ption. Even mor e interesti ng w as the fact that several other people in thi s book project-Li sa, Angi e, and a member of my 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"family-have reported very s imilar situations to the m ilitary interrogation. A nd in these other cases, there w as reas on to believe they were not normal dreams at all. For Anita, however, the evidence of the drea m's reality w as not very strong, w hich is indicative of her tendency not to overreact to possible or actual alien e ncounters. As a resul t, she has managed to keep a g ood sense of mental balance, neither overly exalting the creatures in her mind, making gods of t hem, nor being overwhelmed by terror as if they w ere demons. \"Not all of the aliens are bad,\" she believes, which is a r easonable point of vi ew given the cumulative e xperiences she has had. Still, when they physically intru de into her normal reality, An ita is not happy about it, a s her des cription of tw o ty pical episodes show. \"When I went to bed, \" she said, \"I started feeling a pprehensive. I couldn't go to sleep. It got worse as the hours passed. Finall y, I turned on the bedsi de l amp to read. I had not bee n r eading l ong when I saw a flash of light i n the den. I started t hinking , Oh , geez , no. I told mysel f that maybe i t wa s the light in one of m y aq ua rium s an d t ried t o read s ome more. \"I started hearing a clicking noise,\" she continued, \"and tried to figur e out what i t was. Then I saw, i n my peripheral visi on, a fl ash of brown go past my door towar d the bathroom.\" The \"flash of brown\" was recognizabl e to Anita, and she realized that at least one of the aliens w as in the house. She fought to stay alert, hoping to fend off another abduction, but s he couldn't do it. \"Finally,\" she concluded, \"in s heer fatigue I gave u p and fell asleep. They really are patient li ttle critters.\" If anything occurred a fter that, Anita c ouldn't recall it. But she awoke w ith a po ssible si gn that she had indeed been paid a vis it. \"On Sat urday morning,\" she said, \"my knees and legs were in t errible pain. I have been checked for arthritis and d on't have it.\" Four months later, in December 1993, a si milar incident o ccurred, a s fleeting a nd consciously elusive as the fi rst one. \"I wo ke up around 3:30 a.m.,\" she told me, \"and turned on the television set in the bedroom. This is usually the time I wake up and scan the bedroom for whatev er. I turned on Chan nel F our b ecause they are on all night. I wanted to catch a w eather report because we were expecting sleet.

The alien abducti ons are something she lives w ith very quietly, rarely discussing them with o thers, coping with her fears and uncertai nties as best she can on her own. The experienc es ha ve changed her vi ew s, her h abi ts, and her desi res and fears. The whole texture o f h er life is interwoven w ith the pattern of an unknown agenda.    55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" VI -- Beth \"When I was seven or eight y ears old,\" Beth r elated, \"my father gave us permission, my sister and me, to go outside and play with t he other children, who were playing hide-and- seek. It w as close to six in the evening. I remember that I went to hi de between s ome bushes, and then I heard a sound , somebody else. And as I turned, I saw what I thought at that moment was one of the other kids. \"The ne xt thing I know,\" she c ontinued, \"it wa s dark , and I w as ve ry su rprised . Wh en I go t home, my father was very mad at me and my mother was very u pset. M y father told m e that they had been calling m e and looking for me for hours.

He took me to a ship, but I don't remember w hat happened after that.\" As I listene d to Beth's accoun t of her childhoo d missing-time episode, I was reminded of a similar event in m y husba nd 's past. At age twelve, no t much older than B eth had been, Casey and his best friend w ere playing in a field one day, when several strange children appr oached t hem and asked if they wanted to \"co me see th e UFO\" th at had lan ded on the other side of the hill. Casey's next con scious memory was of c oming back home and complaining to his mother t hat his nose was ver y sore and he had a headac he. As did Beth, Casey had a daytime missi ng-time e pisode initiated after contac t wit h unknown \"children.\" B eth h as n ever e xplored this m emory hypnoti cally, but when Casey used regressive hypnosis to delve into the missing time, he retrieved m emories of an onboard abducti on invol ving a nasal implant. This was not the only simila rity betw een Beth's exper ienc es and Cas ey's. A div orced mother with grown children, Beth had first contacted us, in fact, b ecause another of her encounter memories, i nvolving apparently mili tary personnel , contained ver y striking and disturbing pa rallels to an inci dent described in INTO THE FRINGE. A mut ual acquaint anc e help ed arrange a phone c onversation f or us, and we got acquainted. B eth w as bor n in 1942 in Puerto Rico and has lived ther e most of her life, although her heritag e al so includ es ance stors from Spain and Vermont.

Beth and I discussed he r me mori es o f th e mili tary enco unt er at le ngt h. But I was als o interested to hear about othe r her other ex periences, especially since she l ived in Puerto Rico. A great deal of UFO and alien ac tivity has been reported in the past several years, mu ch of it in the area w here Beth lived but all over the island as well. In fact, of 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"all the U . S. territory, there may well have been more recent UFO activi ty in Puerto Rico than anyw here else. To judge from Beth's account , it has probably been going on for quite a w hile. In addition to the early missing-time event, she has c onsciou s memories of m any othe r strange experiences from c hildhood, w ell back into the 1950s. Her firs t UFO sighting, fo r example, occurred only a year or two after the hide-and-seek episode. Beth was walking to the store in the late afternoon, when she look ed up and saw a \"huge ball of fire\" tea ring do wnward th rough the sky . It di sap pear ed beh ind a near by m ountain, an d Bet h as sumed that she' d j ust wit ness ed a plane crash, although she heard no sound. She screamed and ran back ac ross the road into the house where excitedly she tol d her father what she had seen. Sinc e he worked for th e U. S. Navy at that time, her father told her he woul d i nquire around the m ilitary base and find out what exactly had happened. But a few days later, when Beth brought u p the subject again, her father told her that she m ust never tell anyone about what she had seen or even m enti on i t agai n. No explanation was given, only a warning, and that made B eth believe some sort of myst ery must have been involved. She was used to mysterious things, even at that young age. \"Even before that,\" she said, \"as far back as I can remember, I wa s aware - and so was my famil y - that strange things were happening to m e, m ost of them at night . It made me afraid to g o to sleep, afraid that someone was going to come for me.\" U nexplained noises often broke the silenc e of the night. Once, for example, Beth was startled awake by a \" buzz or whooshing sound\" in the room where she was sleeping alone. Frightened, she ran into her sister's room. \"They're looking for me,\" was all she r emembered saying, because at that moment her s ister suddenly fell into a deep sl eep and Bet h's body became paralyzed. Then she, to o, lost co nsci ousne ss. Anothe r ano malous ev ent to ok place when she ten years old. Beth had been outside for a while and had stopped to eat a piece of fruit. S he consciously remembered standing still, taking a bite, and then looking down at a large, bleeding gash in her leg. \"I d idn't know wh at to think,\" Beth said. \"How could my leg be cut and bleeding? I had not even moved from that spot.\" H eedless of the time as children often are, she had no idea if any was missing. She al so didn't know what to thi nk of the shadow y f igures that sometimes appeared in the house, alt houg h sh e t ended to be lieve they m ight be ghost s. On one occasion , tho ugh , th e fig ure seemed very real . B eth woke up during the ni ght and found a humanoi d figure si tting on her b ed.

B ut when she tried to get up and check on t he gir l, her m other said, she was paralyz ed. A little later, at age fourteen, Beth had a se cond U FO sighting.

Ev en when she moved away fr om that house, s tay ing f or a while after her father' s death in a boardinghouse, the unexplained occurrences followed h er. One of her roommates there woke her up once, s creaming, saying that she'd just seen a weird creature standing beside Bet h's bed. The being appar ently not iced t he r oomm ate looking at it, because it started moving towa rd her, and that w as when she screamed. Her description of the crea ture matches t oday 's well- kno wn Gray ent ity. The odd event s s eemed t o subside as Beth grew to adulthood. She went to college and then began working as a teacher. Nothing notable happened until she was married and pregnant with her second c hild. \"I re me mb er tha t I w as so a frai d tha t I wa sn 't pregnant,\" Beth said, \"that it was a tumor , because it [the fetus] w as not m oving. I told m y doctor frequentl y that it coul dn't be a child, that he was mistaken, but it was a big joke to him. \"When I was almost six months into the p regnancy, I was very worried because the baby wasn't moving. One nigh t I remember that I suddenly felt so sleepy that I got in bed, and I had a dream. I saw m yself on a doctor's table. A strange doctor put a needle into my navel. When he did this, I felt s omething like an electric shock, and the baby started mo ving . I al so fel t th at so me thi ng was put up my nose.

Whatever she may have thought about t hese numerous, o ften n ebulous e vents through t he y ear s, whoever she mi ght have thought w as behi nd them, i n the summer of 1978 an event occurred that left no doubt of its source. On the ni ght of July 17, Beth went to bed around 9 p.m. , wher e she read for an hour and t hen turned off the bedside lamp planning to go to sleep. In the dark, a light caught her attention through the window, where she saw a glowing object. Concerned, Beth woke up her husband and had him check the area. He came back to bed ha ving found nothing unus ual, and they turned out the lam p again to sleep. But the light returned to the yard and shone i n throug h the window. B eth looked up at the light, a nd the next moment she was aware of being som ewher e ver y dif ferent . She was in an unf am iliar round room, and she wasn't alone. Her hus band lay near her, appar ent ly as leep, as w as her youngest child nestled in her lap. In a panic, she suddenly thought, Where are my other children? A voice fr om an unseen source then replied, Don't be afraid, they are her e. Three other people whom Beth didn't know we re al so unconsciou s in the room.

At any rate, when she n oticed the older man coming to consciousness just as she was regai ning her ow n awareness, Beth i nexplicably asked, \"What time is it?\" Given the total strangeness of their situatio n, suc h a question ap pears l udi crous, but instead of reacting with surprise or panic, the man simpl y checked his w atch and replied, 'T en after twelv e.\" Almost tw o hours had passed since she saw the l ight for the second time, although to her it see med as if it had only been a f ew moments.

The two entities were gray and very skinny, dressed in metallic silver suits. Beth saw that her husband was starting to come a round then. But her attention was caught by a startling change in the m etal wall in front of her, as it seemed to transform into glass, like a window. Look ing out, she recognized the location as a rural a rea near some property she owned. A door opened just then, and a very tall m an walked in. He was pale, wit h dark, short hair that formed a widow's peak in the c enter of his forehead. His eyes were larger than usual, and his jaw was very square. The man wore the same tight silv er outfit as t he Grays, but he al so had on gl oves and a wide belt. I n his hands was a small orb tha t looked to be made of glas s, within which m any lights were brightly blinking. As the tall man stared at Beth and her family, she got the impression that he w as perhaps a sci enti st, and she fel t he w as the one \"i n command.\" His gaz e m ade her feel lik e a specimen or a \"guinea pi g.\" \"My husband was starting to wake up,\" Beth said, âand this man put him back to sleep, by holding the glass ball over his head.

She w asn't sure about the tall , dark-haired man, but she was certain t hat the gray beings were not human. Not long after this, B eth once again saw on e of the strange creat ures. She had b een asleep, but the sound of someone calling her na me woke her up. She got up a nd looked out the window, where one of the little b eings was looking back at her. Beth remembered that he was holding a m etal stick of some sort, but the next instant she found herself back in bed, and the little c reature was nowhere to be seen. UFOs al so continued to appear. On Father's Day in 1980, the en tire family wi tnessed one of these events. Out in the yard, two of the children s aw it first and c alled to the others to come look. They arrived in time to see a cl oudy-looki ng object hovering si lently about t en feet fr om the gr ound wit h wh at seemed to be \"bubbles\" inside, befor e it dis appeare d. Less than a year later, Beth once again had a bedroom visitation by unknown beings. As she prepared to go to bed, she began to feel as i f so meone were w atching h er. Turning around, she saw a tall, s lender m an st anding by her bed, and s he bec am e very frightened. Beth tried to scream, but no sound c ame out, so she began to pray silently for help. And then she found that she was moving, going forward t oward the man's outs tretched hand. Unable to stop, s he floated after him toward the w indow and knew she was about to be taken through it. This panicked her ev en m ore, an d she feared she would be \"ground up l ike ham burger\" by the proc ess. The actual m oment of pass ing t hrough th e window, however, left no impres sion on her when it happened, and sh e was next awar e of being in a dar k p lace, lying down, surrounded by \"a feeling of great s peed.\" Blackness overtook her, and the next apparent moment she wa s back in bed in the guest r oom, still unable to move. She could scream, however, whi ch she did, bringing her husband r unning. B ut the strange man, of course, had d isappeared. Beth wasn't the only one in her family to witness the alien beings. In 1986, she and her son saw a small whit e e ntity. B eth wa s in be d when she was s urpr ised t o hear the sound of water running somewhere. As she got up to check for the source, her son called for her to come outsi de with hi m. \"Mommy, look there!\" he shouted, and Beth looked, but w ithout her glasses all she could see was an indistinct w hite object out in the yard. H er son, how ever, had better vision, and he descri bed seeing a s mall being by the garage, holding a garden hose through w hich wa ter w as run ning . A s the so n watched, he told her, the li ttle being stopped and \" floated away.\" Later, in 1987, Beth's daughter said that th ree of the G rays ha d come du ring the night and t aken her ou t to an area near the house, i nto a U FO. S he sai d they talked together in a friendly manner and that one of the aliens even la ughed. She also r eport ed t he pres ence of a str ange man, wh o told her he was going to \"fix\" her hea rt a s he inserted a large needle into her chest. B eth said this occurred at a time w hen her daughter was awaiting heart surgery. 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" It was also at this time that B eth recalled having a brief but vivi d dream that greatl y disturbed her. In thi s dream, she was on a table, loca tion unknown, with three men standi ng around her. T he terri fying part of the scenario w as the single sentence she heard spoken by one of the men: \"S he is expendable, and we can a lways u se a terminat or.\" The experience was so unlike the pr evious enc ount ers she had remem ber ed that Beth insisted it was just a dream, but the i dea and the threat of a \"termi nator,\" whatever it might be, haunted her. So d id the identity of the men. Another situation ar ose during th is time that caused her a great deal of concern, even though it seemed to have nothing to do with UFOs or aliens. S everal different mornings, whe n Beth woke up a nd went in to the k itchen f or coff ee, s he f ound the wa ter jug, no rmally kept in t he r efriger ator, and four glasses containing water sitting out on the counter. The fi rst time thi s occurred, Beth was annoyed by the incons ider ate act, and s he questioned her son and daughter about it. Both of them denied leaving out the wat er jug or ev en b eing in the k itche n af ter bedt ime. The next time she found the dirty glasses and the jug, Beth became angry and found it hard to b elieve her children's protestations of innocence in t he matter. What were they doing, she wondered, getting up in t he m iddle of the nigh t and inv iting in people, visit ing wit h them in secr et? Why wa s it done in s ecret? Why were they denying doing it? The quest ions bot her ed her gre atly, yet th e childr en wer e adamant that they had nothing to do with the intermittent discoveries of the jug and glasses left on the counter by undiscovere d persons during the n ight. Finally Bet h came t o believe t hem, but that made her even more afraid, for it pointed t o a scenario of four strangers with free a ccess to her home and f amily. Yet no one in th e family saw any strangers there, and none of the household goods had been s tolen. But the scenario of strangers breaking in merely for a sip of water just didn't make any sense. And Beth couldn't believe the visi tors we re a liens, not if all they seemed to do was pour themselves a drink, leave a mess on the kitchen counter, and then d isappear. Bet h worr ied about this myst erious sit uation for a long time, even after the vis its stopped. And s he n ever caught anyone in the act of entertaining gu ests o r getting out the w ater jug, w hich w ould have explained the whole affair. Much la ter, however, Bet h did have a flashback me mory concerning this situa tion. In a ve ry u psettin g sce nario, she saw herself opening the door and letti ng a group of people in to the hous e. She even saw hersel f pouri ng the water. Beth didn't recogni ze any of the people, and the flashback memory di dn't show her why she let them in or what they di d there after she poured their drinks. She didn't know if the flashback reflected a real event or if it came from her imaginat ion. It certainly felt real, but it seemed so unlikely that Beth just couldn't acc ept it. In Septem ber 1987, however, an indis putab ly real event occurred. Another UFO appeared and was witnessed by three m embers of the family. 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" \"Mommy, there's a U FO up there!\" Beth heard her daughter shou t on ni ght around 11 p.m. She got up and looked out to see a \"huge, beautiful UFO \" about h alf a mile from the house. Her son also saw it briefly. This sighting seemed no different than previous ones, but it was follo wed th e nex t day by the ons et o f act ivity t hat would continue for years: overflights of u nidentified helicopters. On that first day, an AW AC also flew over, in addition to the black copters , and the craft operated at such low alti tudes that som etimes the windows and the ent ire house were shaken by their force. They returned a w eek later, and this time Beth even witnessed a craft that look ed lik e a helicopter but flew noiselessly. She continued to have frightening noc turnal e xperiences, usually involving fragmented scenar ios and time loss. Once af ter midni ght, for example, Beth went thro ug h an ev ent of which she o nly consciously retained three \"snapshot-type\" memori es. The first p art began when she was still qui te c onscious, as she looked out the window at some red and white lights she'd just not iced in the yar d. The se cond sc ene is of h er out in the yard, watching a craft fly away and crying, \"Don't leave m e.\" This was followed instantly by her being c onscious again and awar e that she wa s back i n he r bed . During these y ears of fairly ac tive alien involvement in her life, Be th had a n umber of dreams relating to U FOs, the G rays, and other sorts of entities. Some people may think that it is foolish to look for information in dreams, but a close familiarity with the m ulti- phenomenal context of the abduction s ituation shows that this is not so. In abduction research it is generally acknowledged that m any times the m emories of an alien encounter, suppressed at the time of the event, will surface in a ny number of ways. It may happen as a sud den flashback during regular consciousn ess, or i t may emerge during the dream state. It also ma y be that what the person recalled as a dream was not a memory of some past event but instead r eflected an e vent of that particular night, so lightly suppressed that it remained in the consciousness as an altered-state awareness. At any rate, it is wise to pay attention to the d reams of a person with current alien ac tivity. C ertain details, o ften iden tical, tu rn up fr om c ase to case tha t differ from the typical archetypal entities and situations found in normal dreams. This was certainly t rue for Beth's dreams . In one, f or exa mple , s he was wit h an unfamiliar alien being in a n e nvironment wh ere t he sky wa s p ink, an d she r ecalled seeing an animal s imilar to a c ow. All of these details hav e been reported by other abductees , sometimes in drea ms and sometimes in actual experiences. So has the scenario she recalled from another dream: being given a liquid to drink by the G rays. In a different dream, B eth was made to i mmerse in \"a he avy liqu id\" an d w as s urprised to find that she could breathe in it. This scenario is so f amiliar now that it is often included in the list of m ost frequently reported abduction events. Beth was concerned and c urious about these d reams, as she was about the exper iences she r ecalled consci ously. So when the opportuni ty arose for her to w ork with a well-known UFO investigator and to u ndergo regressive hypnosis, Beth decided to do it. 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"In early 1988 she underwent four separate sessions of hy pnos is, all f ocusing on a s ingle event: the encounter in 1978 when she remembered being in a c ircular room with her hus band, on e c hild, and t hree strangers. The foll owing account i s a composite of the information from those sessions, comprising all the bit s and pieces that emer ged during the regres sions. Beth r ecalled t hat when t he light shone in through the window that night, she saw that several aliens were in the room. She was terrif ied, but one of them calmed her and seemed to be in charge as they led her outside to a craft. The next part of her memory is patchy, for she was in a small room in which the atmosphere seemed \"foggy,\" and she could n't see mu ch mo re th an seve ral s trange instruments o n a table. One of them looked somewhat like a hair dryer. Next, two of the aliens took her down a curved hall through a do or, into a different are a. It looked to Beth like \"a surgery room,\" and she became afraid they were going to kill her the re. She cri ed ou t in fear w hen they plac ed her on a \"fl oating\" table. Overhead s he saw a screen upon whic h her insides were displayed. A third alien in this room engaged in some communicati on with the two escorts. Beth sensed that h e seem ed more compassion ate than the othe rs. T his th ird entity, holding a bla ck box, then moved to a pos ition behind Beth. She could not see what he did, but she fel t as i f her head was being \"opened\" and her br ain r emoved, all wit ho ut any sensation of pain. After she felt as if she were \"all put bac k toget her again,\" a cold liquid was poured over her head. When this p rocedure w as finished, the a liens stood in front o f her, and Beth realized that m ent ally she w as different. He r thoughts and reactions to everything w ere changed, i t seemed, and she w as filled wi th new ideas about God and the unity of all life wit hin t hat supr eme s ourc e. This very spiritual moment was followed by a quite physical exam, as the ali ens took samples from her ski n and hair. A man with a widow's-peak h airline, similar to the one she'd seen before, en tered and made a ful l ex ami nation of her body, incl uding a gynecologi cal procedure. This w as the m ost upsetting part of the experience for Beth, and she was espe cially frightened when he p roduced two long, thin needl es and expl ained that he had to make some \"corrections\" involving her kidney and ovar y. He ins erted the needles in the areas of those organs, and Beth fel t a warm vi bration. The m an said this \"alignment\" was necessary to put her glands i n better condition for what they wanted her to d o, \"in service to humanity.\" He talked at length about changing the human \"vibration.\" Next, a young woman, si milar in looks to the man, c ame into the room and proceeded to clean B eth's body with a sponge and liquid. She esc orted Bet h back to the first room, wher e t he m an c ont inued t o explain abou t ce rtain th ings. Fo r one, he tol d he r th at she and other humans were \"ch osen\" to carry out \"jobs\" in th e future. He al so described a coming disaster in the world, and he explained to her about w orking \"as a spiritual being\" for the good of humanity. T he alien said that his group was here to s tudy, collect genet ic m aterial, and av ert a destr uctive process which humans had started. 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"She then recalled noth ing more than being back in t he round room wi th her husband. Beth w as very shaken by the recovered me mories, and she s aid she had no id ea why she was \"chosen,\" as they had told h er. After the regressions, B eth's su bcon sci ou s be came mo re accessible, because she sta rted having conscious flashbac ks of pre viousl y unr emembered e ven ts. In the sum mer of 1988, while chat ting with a friend, Beth s uddenly experienced one of these flashbacks. It began with her in a small flying disc, entering a well-lit underground city. The craft flew on through a t unnel passage into an enorm ous c avern that contained s ever al buildings. Beth also saw some UFOs parked in various locations and aliens working side by s ide with hum an m ilitary pers onn el. The next scenario is of Beth flyi ng somehow th roug h a body of w ater , into a tunnel , and then emerging from a lake. S he also remembered trying to run aw ay, but a big man grabbed her and said, \"We brought you here because we want you to see this\" as a huge cra ft ros e out of the w ater. B eth then got back int o the little craft and f lew up to the hu ge one. The entire mem ory was st range and disturbi ng, and Beth had no idea when such an event might have occurred. Shortly after the regre ssions, in August 1988, Beth r eceived a mysterious phone call from a voice that sounded as i f it were coming from a vacuum. An u nknown man said, \"Elizabeth. \" \"Yes,\" Beth replied. \"Who are you?\" \"We know about your experience,\" the voi ce sa id, \"and we k now ab out all t he pr ob lems and doubt s you have, but we can give yo u p roo f.\" \"Who are you?\" Be th persisted. \"Why are you t elling me this?\" \"Don't be afrai d,\" the st range voice continued. \"We can give you proof. W e want to talk to you, so next Thursday go to the botanical garden. Be there at ten. We know you. Don't worry about looking for us. Don't t ell anybody , and go there alone. \" Everything about the call was suspicious -the use of a disguised voice, the disturbing references to Beth' s \"ex perien ces,\" the insiste nce tha t she co me b y herself to th e meet ing-and she f elt the c all implied a threat. She told the investigator with whom she was working, but she didn't want to go to the garden. Later, however, Beth changed her mind, so she picked up the investigator and we nt on to the appointed p lace. Although neither of them saw any suspicious humans or any alien presences, Beth said a communic ation about love, faith, friendship, and service was put into her m ind there in the garden. On the drive back home, Beth felt dizzy and ill. Her body didn't seem to \"work ri ght,\" and her sense of time w as very disoriented. A ccording to the clock, she even gained time on the return trip, and for a while thereafter, day and night seemed to come and go ve ry qu ickl y. Even mo re di sconce rting was the clear sensation of her hand passing through solid object s as she reac hed f or them. But the bi zar re perc ept ions ev ent ually 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"passed, and there were no further phone calls. In 1990, two years afte r the fl ashback of the underground facility wit h humans and aliens working together, more of Beth's memo ries of this event surface in a dream.

A dark, grassy po ol of w ater w as near a large metal buil ding that looked like a warehouse inside. An old-f ashioned wo oden door opened t o reveal a very high- tech metal door, through whi ch Beth was taken into a large room. There she saw four bi g tables and a number of people. So me of them looked to be m ilitary, some were clad like scientists, and others appeared to be \"regular\" people. A u niformed, red-headed man, one of the two who had br ought her to the f acilit y, seem ed t o be \"in char ge\" o f her. Two mor e men ent ered the r oom, wearing outfits B eth described as similar to astronaut's gear. They talked with Beth and the other people, although she d idn't remember what was said, and then someone shouted and the gr oup started runnin g toward the bac k of the large room . The red-hair ed man grabbed h er, and then the flashback ended, but the next morning Beth found bruises in the exact spot wher e the man had gripped her arm. The memory felt real, but she had no idea wh en s uch a fantastic event might have occurred. O f course, mysterious things had been happeni ng all along and c ontinued to occur-sightings o f U FOs a nd s trange light s, episodes of unex plai ned ti me gaps, occasional appearances of patterned bruises and punctures on her body-and for most of these events Beth had no ex planation or memory, ei ther. It w as cl ear that her consci ous recol lections about these things w ere merely the tip of the iceberg, and whatever lay b eneath the surface had be en deep ly su pp ressed . Beth might have been able to tell hers elf that all t hese events weren't real, that she had imagined them, until an event occurred w hich proved that the w eirdness w asn't only in her mind. I n 1992 during a v isit to Miami, she and a friend were driving from his hous e to her daughter's home one night, a trip of thi rty to fo rty-five min utes o n the turnpike. They started out at 9:50 p.m. and things proceeded n ormally at first. But then they both notic ed that the others c ars, in bot h dir ections, had dis appeared from view.

But her friend, w ho drove that turnpike regularly, told her there was no bridge at that location. They continued on the drive, be wildered. When they r eached her daughter's home, all the lights were out a nd the place was silent. Beth looked at her watch and w as shock ed t o see t hat it read 11: 55. Sh e kn ew they should have arrived no later tha n 10:4 5, which meant that over an ho ur was m issing. And t his time, she hadn't been alone. The mystery was just as great as ever, though, for neither of them remembered a nything other than being in the car. The pat tern was alw ays the s ame: ev idenc e of an odd event, a fragment of a puzzling scenario, and a blank in the place w here the details should have been. E very missing hour w as a grievous loss to Be th, a dark emptiness in he r life. She had seen aliens, and she had seen humans, some of them m ilitary, but she had no clue as to what any of them were really doing. The agenda behi nd these events has remai ned u nknown, and Beth has continued to struggle with h er questions and her fears, because the events continue to occur. In Januar y 1993, for instance , whe n she wa s staying in a Miam i apartment with her son and daught er, Beth experienc ed another mi ssing-ti me episode, and this ti me she discov ered artifactual evidence afterward. The event was preceded by a n umber of odd but mi nor occurrences involvin g eac h member of the family. On Wednesday, January 27, they had all gone to bed by mi dnight. Beth awoke at 4:39 a.m. and went to the bathroom. O n her way back to bed, she suddenly f elt a compulsion or instructi on to go into the kitchen and pull up the wind ow. She bec ame afraid and fought ag ainst the urge, bu t still she walked to the window and opened it wit hout looking out, before r eturning to her bed. As she lay down, Beth glanc ed at the windo w and tho ught, I don't want to see. She began to tu rn ov er to face the other direction, and at that moment she heard s omething that sounded like a t rain, follow ed b y the so und of an el ectroni c doo r closi ng. Rolling on over, she glanced at the window again-and saw that it was daylight outside. The bedside clock read 6:45. Two hours had dis appeared in the ti me it took her, c onsciously, to turn over in the bed. The realization startl ed her, and Beth got up in great agitation . She went to the kitchen to make coffee and tried to figure out what had happened, but without success. Then she wen t to ta ke a sh ow er, and t hat was when she noticed that bot h of her k nees w ere coated w ith a chalky w hite substance, a s if she'd been kneeling in the unknown powder. B ut she couldn 't imagine where she might have been, for the s ubstance was unlik e anyt hing in her house. In spite of her agitation, the morning's acti vities had to go on, so B eth w oke up her children to get ready for work. Before he left, her son remarked that s omething might have happened to hi m durin g the night becaus e he'd disc overed a punctur e on his 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"forearm that he couldn't explain. When they returned i n the ev eni ng, Beth told them about the events of the pr evious night: the strange sounds , the missing ti me, t he w hite substance, and the apparen t fact that she must have been out of the house temporarily. But her son, who'd slept at the f oot o f Beth's bed i n a sl eep ing bag, said he didn't think that was possible. \"She was sitting in b ed last ni ght,\" he told his sister. \"She act ed afraid, ta lking to someone. I saw a figure in the doorway,\" he added, but at the time, he s aid, he couldn't get up and apparentl y fel l ba ck as leep. Ev ery thing about the event remained a mystery. In thi s final account fr om Beth's ongoi ng experiences, an event occurred w hich had ident ical detail s to a bizarre report I had l earned about from a cl ose relative. Beth's parallel st ory confirmed that it wasn't the imaginings of a si ngle mind . Eithe r the a liens were actually doing these things, activities that were not familiar from other abduction accounts, or t hey wer e cr eat ing t he sam e virtual- reality scenar io for a t least two unr elated abductees. Bet h wa s in Miam i whe n th e exper ienc e occurr ed, s taying wit h a friend and s leeping on his couch. One night, she awoke and watched in amazement as \"a r ectan gle of light, like a very thin page of paper\" came in through the w indow . She could see an area in t he center where whit e, pink, and purple lights were movi ng abo ut. The rectangle of light stopped in mid-air, and out of its center em erged a f ull-grow n man, very tall, wearing a tight -fitting su it and a small helmet. The man stood up and leaned ov er her, bringing his f ace v ery close to hers. He was above her, but as she stared into his eyes, she said she fel t as i f she were falli ng. That's where the memory ended, and Beth was aware of nothing mo re until s he awoke in the mo rning, in a daz ed, grog gy condition that pers ist ed thr oughout t he day. Enduring repeated episodes of such activity , she has n o c learer u nderstanding o f these events now than at f irst. She does, howev er, have f eelings abou t it all, and certain beliefs to w hich she cli ngs. Although she is never certai n of who has abducted her or w hat they have done, B eth feels that at leas t one of her experiences , the 1978 event, involved a b enevolent group of aliens. \"They brought me an enormous sense of affinity with G od,\" she said, \"with the universe, and wi th love.\" But she al so recogni zes that other forces seem to be a part of the overall phenom en on. 'Ther e's a batt le of good and evil,\" she said, explaining her feelings about t he situation. \"Sometimes they interact in our lives, b ring pain and confusion, but I hold onto fai th tha t my good E Ts will help us.\" She feels very strongl y that the future catastrophic events the aliens described will in deed come about, and that she and ot her abductees will play a vital role a t that time. But that doesn't keep her from feeling f ear a nd d epression.

They may not have been aware of UFOs and aliens, at least by those terms, but they knew my sterious things had oc curred. In Jane's case, however, her consciously recalled experiences with the unknown didn' t begin until 1992. Since that ti me, she has witnessed almost every t ypical detail of the abduction sit uat ion-a lif e's worth of experi ences in l ess than two years. And with a ll the events so recent, her situation offered an ex cellent opport unit y for res earch. She was eager to shar e information a fter o ur initial contact, a nd she genuinely wanted to understand this myst erious new p uzzle in her life. Born in 1943, Jane has Irish, English, German, French, C reek, C herokee, and Apache ancestry. She is a sixt h-generation Te xan residing in the central hill c ountr y. Jane was a nurse for many years, until ar thrit is prevent ed her from working, and she has a lso been a journalist, photogr apher, and a vocational archaeologis t. She is d ivorc ed, wit h no children, and lives wi th severa l dogs, i ncluding her fav orite bu ddy , \"XZ,\" in a rural setting near a large c ity. Com pact, independent, and perky, Jane enjoys sky-watchi ng a nd music, incl uding voice reci tals. In addition to her professional talents, Jane has a lso demonstrated psychic abilities. \"I was tested for ov er two y ear s on a regular bas is,\" she reported, \"by t wo research foundations in San Antonio ...for psychic abilities.\" Am ong them were telepathy, precognition, psycho kine sis, re mo te vi ew ing, and clairvoyance, with the tests showing positive re sults. And since the UFO activity had started, her psychic senses seemed t o hav e incr eas ed. \"Lately my psychic abilities have intensified to the point that it's hard for m e to be around groups any length of time,\" she said, \"wit hout feeling mentally 'assaulted and battered'.\" These abilities may be part of the reason why Jane's flashes of memories have com e so of ten wh ile she ha s been conscious, rather than only through dreams. Her UFO in vo lveme nt b egan in the summer of 1992 with a multiple- witness sighting, and a number of strange events soon followed. \"Something deep and pr ofound has been occurring to m e since July '92,\" she said in our fi rst corresp ondence. \"If you ask me i f I've been abducted I have to honestl y say I have n o absolute memory per se. I can only point to my scars and sa y I think somethi ng has happened but I c annot remember, only f lashes of things, and I'm not sure I can trus t the flashes.\" Like Polly and sever al others, Jane was not eager t o claim abductee status, nor that her experiences would be c onfirmed as ' abs olut ely' real by an outsi de o bserver. In fact, she made no claims at all about what t hese events and the alien agenda might be, but she did hope to find answers . And when she realized the possible implication s of several ev ents, Jane approached the phenomenon from an investigative poi nt of v iew. T his involved keeping scrupulous journal entries, not only of sightings, flashbacks, d reams, and odd events, but al so of her phy sical and e motional responses to these thi ngs. She fi led 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"sightings r eports wit h the local MUFON group and hosted several parties of sky w atchers on the property. Further, Jane a ttempted on many occasions to photograph the UFOs, as well as the helicopters and odd planes - sometimes invi sible ones, h owever - which over flew her home. From these research records and my investigat ion, the following ac count emerged, showing the presence of an abduction hist ory. In Jane's case, several things ar e noteworthy. For one, the frequency of her UFO sightings is well abov e th at of t he ty pical abduct ee, and several of them were m ultiply witnessed or photographed. Also, while J ane has not recalled a c onscious full- blown enc ounter, most of her memories have come from conscious flashbacks r ather than dreams. H er dreams, by the w ay, are viv id and frequent ly rec alled, but they seem only occasionally to contain alien-related information , and this is usually in a screened form. Finally , Jane's ex peri ences have invol ved a number of tel epathi c c ommunications and sudden \"knowings \" of m essages or information. She marks the date of her involv ement from the Augus t sighting, but for a couple of months before this, Jane sensed something different in her e nvironment. She said she felt as if she were being watched, and thinking in normal te rms that the watchers w ere human, she became very cautious and alert. For a while she resorted to carrying a gun, so c ertain was she of an unseen presence. And then she saw the U FO on Au gust 12, 1992, w ith a w itness, and her reali ty began to shatter. \"Since it was during t he Pers eid meteor shower and my mo m h ad nev er seen one,\" Jane said, \"we decided to get up at 4 a.m. at the height of the shower to get a good show. W e didn't really see many me teors, but we stayed out even thou gh it was disap point ing. \"At about 5: 30 I saw a whit e br ight light doing odd maneuvers i n the sky overhead. I call ed Mom's att ention t o it, and t hen we wat ched a spect acular UFO sh ow by first one, then two lights, for about f ifteen minut es, unt il day light. M om and I wer e am azed by wh at we' d seen and talked about i t all day.\" The lights w ere round and w hite, one brighter than the other, and th ere was no sound. The first light cavorted constantly, m aking rapid figure-eight, circular, and L-shaped patterns. When the second, larger light showed up, the two objects raced toward each other. The fi rst one blinked to a stop and the s econd one circled around it. Then th ey made a series o f fast movement s, \"lik e two flies f lying in circles around eac h other. \" They separated fo r a w hile, eac h engaged in its own ae rial man euvers, un til the second obj ect depart ed t o the west. The f irst object remained in sight, flying in va rious patter ns, un til the rising sun o bscured its light. Jane was excited by the event and thought about it frequently for a few days, but then, as she told me, \"After a while life took over and i t was pushed to the bac k burner unt il Oct ober 1. \" Her sister came to visit that evening, and when Jane menti oned that bats had been coming t o catch bugs around the outdoor light, the y went ou t to watch th em. \"It w as bar ely da rk, a nd the bats w ere active,\" Jane sa id, \"when we saw a very b right white light coming fast and low toward us from the west. It went direct ly over without a sound, t urned slightly southeast, went a short w ay, and blink ed out. We never saw a shape of any sor t 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"attached to the light. And we saw three more lights d oing impossible maneuvers that night. \" This sec ond sighting of anom alous aerial activ ity s eriously puzzled Jane, and through a magazine article she obtained the phone number for MUFON, M utual UF O Net work. She w as put i n tou ch w ith a local MUFON group and recei ved a fo rm to report her sightings. Shortly afterward, Jane joined the organ izat ion and began to read ab out the subj ect. Through the books and arti cles , she learned not o nly about UFO sightings but also about the abduction phenomenon. \"It w as the reading,\" she said, \"that helped me realize that m aybe something was happeni ng to me. I had had many of the same o dd things happen to me that I was reading about. It w asn't until Novem ber 3 that I made a list of the odd things that had happened si nce Jul y. The list frightened m e because it had too many classic signs. And I k ept h aving a g ut feeling that s omething had happened.\" One parti cular i tem on the li st was especial ly suspi ciou s, as i t involved a ti me gap. Planning to dri ve i nto tow n with her fri end B renda to see some fri ends perfor m i n a band, Jane left her house just bef ore 7 p.m . on Oc tober 30 t o m ake the fiftee n-m inute drive. \"I wa s just a sho rt w ay down the road from my house,\" Ja ne described, \"when an owl came flying directly at my windshield. I tho ught it was going t o crash into the glass, but at the last minute it just curved smoothly over the t op of the car without c ontact. I had never had that happen and was glad it didn't hit m e. I continued on m y way and got to Brenda's. She met me at the door, worried and as ked if an ything was wron g. I sa id, 'N o, wh y?' \"She said that I was late, and she had called the h ouse and left a message on my phone machine. She was worri ed because I w as usual ly earl y, and i t was lat e en ough that s he thought maybe I'd had a wreck o r something. I was really surprised to find out that it was 7:50 p.m. I couldn't account for the time loss b ecause I should have been there by 7:10 or 7:15 at the lat est.\" The whole thing m ade no s ense, for Jane went back t hrough the trip me ntally several times and could not find any rea son for the thirty-to- forty-five mi nute delay, not even a moment out of sequence. \" But something didn't feel right,\" she said. \"I think it wor ked on my s ubc onsc ious, becaus e it was th ree days later that I made the list of all the curious things that had been happen ing sinc e July. \" Ten day s later, Jane began keep ing a da ily journal of events. S he woke up that morning with a bloody n ose, sore throat, and large bruises on her ar m for which she couldn't account. She had not been aw are of anything unusual, other than a vague sense of some act ivity. Many of the od dities she' d not ed wer e too am biguous to give her proof of any abductions or alien involvement in her life. But the UF O sightings w ere real, that much felt certain, and they continued to recur. 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The v ery next one, in fact, was ev en pr eceded by an annou nceme nt o f sorts. At 3 p .m. on Dec ember 1, Jane s uddenly received a communication, a very clear m essage that the UFOs would show up that night for he r to pho tograph. She was given ex plicit instructions to clea n he r le ns and put ne w batteries in the camera. \"I'll get my camera and they'll sho w as a sign for me,\" s he noted in her journal, \"I feel it strongly.\" At 5:30 she prepared, with a pal let, binocul ars, the camera, and warm clothing. At 6:40, the UFO appeared. Jane quickly snapped five p hotos. One of t hem turned out well, show ing a l arge si ngle ligh t of which the back portion appear s wider than the front. I t wasn't as good as she hoped, but good enough to m ake her determined to shoot m ore photos, since the UFOs seemed to be showing up rather frequentl y. A nd after the fulf illm ent of the tele pathic commu nicat ion's pr om ise, J ane coul dn't help but feel that the myste rious phenomenon of lights in the sky wasn't a random occur rence. This seemed to have a connection to her. The nex t day, December 2, w hen she re turned home from voice lessons, Jane entered the house and discovered an unrecognizable odor permeating the air. She described it as \"acri d, st rong, h eavy, sha rp, punge nt, a nd tangy ,\" unr elated to food or smok e odors, and unlike anyt hing she'd ever smelled. Its s ource was never located. That night , Jane wit ness ed another anomalo us light. This one w as not in the sky, but rather low to the ground and very close to her house. It wa s shortly a fter midnight, and she had turned off the light for the ni ght. \"I was l ying quietly on my back , thi nkin g,\" J ane said, \"and my blinds were open. Shortly, just b eyond the trees, I saw a flashing blue light. I saw it at the top of my cedar t ree, and th en i t dropped dow n to the lev el of t he window cross panes. Dogs all around began barking-mine didn't, they lay asleep-and I thought, They're herel My whole body tingled, and m y mid-section welled up with somet hing. I watched and didn't see anyth ing els e for a few minut es. The n I saw a 'light bulb flash' to the right and then left of the w indow .\" Her drawi ng sh ows an intermi ttent light spiraling downward, mov ing from one side to the o ther in the window. Inexplicably-or perhaps not-Jane didn't get up to c heck on the situation. Instead, she instantly fell asleep. \"I was awake one minu te-the next, asl eep,\" h er journal notes. \"I guess I was scared.\" Two and a half hours later, at 3:40 a.m. on D ecember 3, Jane woke up. She felt instantly awake and alert, as if she hadn't been as leep at all, and stayed up the res t of the night. A round 6 a.m., Jane h appened to look at her back and was surprised to see two fresh scratches on her left shoulder and a scratch and a welt on the l eft one. She also noticed as the day went on that she was having difficulty d iscerning right and left dir ections, som ething that had never happ ened to h er be fore. This las ted two weeks, as did an almost to tal loss of short-term m emory. At 7:15 a.m. the house was s haken and vibrated by t he loud noise of a helicopter. It flew toward the south, lingered m oment arily by the side of the hous e, and then continued on. Jane was sur prised by th e helicopter, because even though there had been an unusual number of them flying over her house since the first U FO sighting, she hadn't seen one in several days. The last one's arrival had coincided with a UFO, s he realized, 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"just as thi s one showed up only hours a fter the blue light's appearance. She wondered if she were imagining connections that didn't exist, if her i ncreasingly agitated, disor iented, and fright ened s tate of mind was cl ouding her logic. B ut the nervous feelings continued, even though she tried to explain t hem away. 'The strobe light scares me bec ause ther e was no sound,\" she noted in the jour nal, \" and the l ight was too close not to hear if i t was a plane or ' copter. It was a silent light.\" A si lent light , pr ece ded b y an unkn own ac rid odor, follow ed immed iately by a s udden loss of consci ousness, and i n conjuncti on w ith unex plained s cratche s, body m arks, and disorientation. All that we re mis sing we re the me mo ries. On the evening of D ecember 4, Jane found another u nexplained injury, a quarter-sized bruise on her right hand. Examining the re st of her body, she also n oticed a new addit ion t o a pat tern of m arks whic h had been show ing up on her forearm. They inc luded two ci rcles and two lines in a V-shape, and now th ere was also a \"c ut-line\" connected to the larger cir cle as well as a small red dot near the ot her c ircle. The c losing lines of her jour nal entry f or that day include a very intriguing final line: \"Felt better after I talked to S.L. and I laughed and laughed tonight. I needed it. I feel good, up. I'm not so afraid to see them now. I feel a lot has been c onnected in my m ind.\" Two nights later, Jane recorde d a curiou s drea m which occurr ed bet ween 11 p. m. when she w ent to bed an d 1:30 a .m. w hen she aw ok e. On t he sur fac e, not hing a bout it seemed r elat ed to any of these p revious events, but an exam ination of several details show s a possi ble screen memo ry or screened new e vent. \"A group of women arrived at my house for a 'bi rthday' pa rty,\" she noted in the journal . \"They seemed famil iar but di dn't know any of them from ' real life.' They were purposeful and qui etly determined. W e did some [unremembered] things in a small house. I stayed mostl y in the 'bedroom.' I was dis agr eeable aft er a while and they wer e put out with me. One of them I knew better, and she was the l eader. They were about as tall as I. I don't remember spoken words. A t one point I w as real disagreeable and tussled with them. They left m e in the bedroom and conf erred toget her in the kitchen. \"Finally t hey cam e out and said t hey had t o go. Th ey began to leave as a group, and I felt bad about what I'd done and asked them to reconsider. They said no and looked put-out. They began to leave, and I watched them go sadly an d re lieved, too. The lead er did all the communic ating. \" Jane enc losed a number of wo rds in quotat ion ma rks , as if to sug gest tha t they weren't wh at they seemed to be, includi ng \"birthday,\" \"real lif e,\" and \"bedr oom.\" Do they suggest that the purpose of the g roup's visit w as not her birthday, that they m ight be familiar from experiences that weren't part of Jane's normal life, and that the room was not a bedroom? The group's dem eanor is not festive, but rather \"purposeful \" and quiet. No one speaks but the leader-a curious term for a social visitor. S he didn't remember her activities w ith the group in the bedroo m, nor why she was \"disagreeable\" and 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" resistant. Whatever occurred was clearly not a party g ame. And finally, her feelings about them when they prepare to depart are strangely am biguous. If thes e vi sitors, e vents, and emo tions ar e p ut into abduc tion terms, the par allel is obvi ous: A group of vaguely familiar v isitor s arr ive and int eract wit h a pe rson in a small enclosure. The interactions are disagreeable to the person, who feels resistant. Only one of the group, the leader, co mmunic ates with the p erson. When the visitors leave, the person has confused emoti ons and cannot recall all the details of the in terac tion . Given these parallels, it ma y well be that Jane's d ream images screened an actual alien e ncounter. Five days later, howev er, on December 9, she had a c onscious perception of unknown visitors. She awoke from a dream around 5:30 a.m. and re alize d she w as hearing \"voices and fain t music\" downstai rs in the l iving room. She listened in surprise, bu t abr uptly the noises ceased. \"Then I could hear someone walking away from t he bed toward the stairs and down them,\" she wrote. 'The sound was a loud ' blue jeans rub' between the t highs of a man. I listened for several mo ments when suddenly I ca ught the black outlin e of a man slipping past my w indow. He had a faint light outlinin g him. He was t allish and in a hur ry. H e was jus t a qui ck fli cker and then gone. I was par alyzed with fear. I t ried to reach for m y gun, but I couldn't move! I tr ied so hard, but I was so sc ared I couldn't move. W hen I looked at the window, I could move then, and e verything was okay.\" This intrusi on marked the end of a series of events t hat had begun with the silent blue light nea r Jane's house. Ot her possible UFO sight ings cont inued to occur, not always with concomi tant odd acti vity. S he watched two noctur nal lights fly i n an arched path on January 9,1993, for i nstan ce, and three li ghts goi ng i n opposi te dire ctions on April 10. \"The lights would fade in, trav el slowly, and then fade out or disappear,\" she w rote in her journal. \"I saw two bright, golden s treaking meteors, plus a h uge bright flash through the trees southwest of my h ouse. Seemed to be in the woods.\" And then on May 16, Jane had a spectac ular UFO sighting that was witnessed not only by her mother, who was visiting, but also by several people all a round the area of a lar ge lak e. T hat evening, Jane r eceived a ph one c all from one of the local MU FON members who told her that she' d gotten a report of a t riangular UFO near Jane's location. She asked if Jane would go out side and have a look. Imme diately Ja ne ra n out a nd spotted a light in the sky towar d the lake, alternating or rotating with red, green, amber, and whi te li ghts. Her mother stepped out and also saw the object, whic h hov ered for about ten mi nu tes be fore drifting off to th e no rth. Jane was distracted by her mo ther for a few m inutes, and when she looked back to the west, the light was gone. Disappoint ed, she st oo d th ere a while w ishing it would come back so she could make a bett er obs ervation. W ithin minutes, unbelievab ly, the triangular craft reappeared , floating low overhead with a soft humm ing sound and a wh oo sh of ai r as i t passed. The li ghts show ed di fferent col ors this time, with four white 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"lights dow n its sides, a big white light on the front, a nd a blink ing red light. As it turned out, there were quite a few wit nesses. A local weekly new spaper report ed the sighting in its May 20 edi tion w ith a fron t-page story. The UFO was described as \"rainbow-colored\" and w as seen between 9 and 10 p.m. A couple of hours later, the U FO had retur ned, or perhaps a different craft, because the police started getting reports around midnight of an object with orange, blue, and white lights which ap peared to descend or land in a field. W hatever Jane had been seeing, others had seen things, too, and she had no doubt of the UFO's reality. Nor could s he i gnor e the w eird external event s and oddities that had been occurring since her fi rst sighti ng in t he summer of 1992. The list of these events reads like a litany of peripheral abduction activi ty. To begi n with, not onl y di d she see the anomalous flying lights, Jane als o oc ca sionally witnes se d s maller, cl os er, mo re personal displays. Som etimes they were nearby in t he woods, and s ometimes even closer, as in the instance where two bright lights \"zi pped\" between J ane and a friend wi th her on a sky watch. Bizarre el ectrical disturbances re curred , such as a radi o suddenly turning its elf on, a television tu rning off, and a broken ceiling light tu rning on by itself, a fter five months of not w orking. Jane also had strange phone acti vity over these months. She r eceived silent call s and numerous w rong-number calls of a s uspicious nat ure, a nd her answering machine behaved oddly. Additi onall y, she noted a n umber of time discrepancies. There w ere many unexplained noises in the house that had not been present before , loud pops, pings, a nd creaks out of th e or dinary , as w ell as hummi ng an d buzzing noi ses and strange cli cking sounds on occasion. Outs ide of the house, l oud he licopt ers started flying overhead at odd ti mes of the day and night. When Jane reported this activity to the local UFO st udy gr oup, t he patt ern changed f or a while, and instead of helic opter s she wit ness ed a variety of pl anes now buzz ing the property, inc luding invis ible o nes. Several times Jane awoke with her panties inside o ut, even though she is certain she didn't remove them. Also, s he woke up once with he r slee ping shi rt inside out. And she has found bl ood on her pil low in addi tion to in her ear a nd nose, wit hout any inj ury to account for these instances. But there have been injuri es at other ti mes, mostly insignificant yet inexplicable in everyday terms. \"I've had numerous unexplai ned odd brui ses on my l egs a nd arms,\" she told me, \"and odd scratch whelps on m y back. R ight this m oment , I have a br uise under my right eye that w asn't there yesterday and small r ound bruis es on my right thigh on the ins ide.\" Jane has also had a nu mber of \"puncture\" marks in various places, inc luding at one point several punctures insi de her mouth and on her br east. Sometimes the m arks appeared after a suspected encounter or strange dream, but not always, and there were usually only a very few of them at a time. But on one occ asion, after a vivid dayt ime dream 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"of seei ng a Gray, Jane found a num ber of body mar ks. \"Saw a G ray coming through a door with light behind him,\" she wrote in her journal. \"I wasn't afraid.

He lifted his left ar m and inst ead of [it bending at the elbow], his arm \" S-ed\" to lift. No elbow used . His ha nds wer e ov ersized with a covering. S eems like he had a willowy neck. Hi s e ntire body was willowy, slender, sli ght, and fragile-l ooking, grayish color as best as I could see.\" Jane remembered no activity in the dream, only s eeing the Gray. But that same day she discovered an extraordinary number of new m arks all over her body. From her calves to her shoulders, Jane and a f riend counted and photographed ten s cratches, t hirteen bruises, fi ve scraped or scoo ped areas, two punctures, and an equilateral triangle of three dots. These appear to have been very rece nt, because ei ght par allel, claw- like welt s on he r shoulders fa de d a way during the morning hour s. For Jane, the UFO s ight ings and the physica l marks were hard, believable evidence, things that could be photographed to show that something u nusual was going on in her life. She had no photos, how ever, of t he UFOs ' occupants nor of whoever or w hatever had caused the body marks. W hat she did have w ere flashback m emories, sudden conscious images of sc enes in which sh e was with aliens. Th ey were brief and incomple te, bu t tan talizingly evocative of m any m ore unr ecalled ev ent s. Once, she suddenl y \"saw\" hersel f lying on her b ack, in a dark, dense atmosphere. \"Little hands are beneath me,\" she said, \"and I'm moving softly t hrough the air.\" She felt p anicked, u nable to respond, and then the memory cl icked off. In another, J ane recalled being wi th four aliens, fighting them as they carried he r away, and be ing told of some impending event. One sudden m emory showed her on a table with four Grays around her, one of them tinkering with a s quare box t o whic h ho ses we re attached that ra n up to the ceiling. Anot her scenar io involved t he aliens t aking sample scrapings fr om her fingernails, which they telepathic ally e xplained as a test \"to check for p ollution.\" Two of the flashbacks concer ned events in a round r oom. In the first one, she saw a white, curved desk and a group of s even be ings with long hair and white robes seat ed behind it. The being in the center held a brilli antly lit globe in fron t of its face, and the features of t he ot her s ix wer e indis tinct. The second event, a tele pat hic comm unic ation, came in a flash just afte r Jane had heard a weird humm ing noi se on her porch. A scene came i nto her mind, of the insi de of a craft which was sparsely f urnished and illum inat ed by a lemony colored light. T hree Grays were present, one of whom was dressed i n a long robe and another who was busy with contr ol-like equipm ent on the wall. Jane began to pick up telepathi c communicati on t hen, hearing Activate, activate, activate repe ate dly. This was followed by the name s of c ertain towns and a reas in Texas, including the Panhandle, Big Bend, G onzales , Llano, and the Louisiana- Texas bor der. 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"While the i mages c ont inued in her m ind, the hummi ng nois e on the por ch gr ew louder and followed her inside, w here the implanted vision continued. One of the Grays turned as if to look at Jane with an expr ession of \"parent al amusem ent.\" Some of her dreams, as noted earlier, seemed to contain scenes and information that could be r elated t o possible alien experiences, al though they were usually in scr eened form. A few of the dreams, about impending dis asters and UFOs landing either to inv ade, m onit or, or rescue humans, ar e common among abducte es. A lso common are dreams about sickl y babi es, acts of tel ekinesi s and l evitation, and s trange pe op le's faces very close to o ne's own. Jane has had all of these dreams. Her most i mpressive UFO dream occurred in the w ee hours of December 31, 1992, and, like so many abduct ees' \"dreams,\" this one proved to be the m emory of a very real event. Jane's journal entry for that day began with her noticing a new m ark on her body around 8:30 am. It was a straight, \"grooved\" l ine over 1 -1/2 inches l ong on top of he r shinbone near the ankle. Then she described the dream. \"Had viv id! dream ,\" she noted, \"with e xtraordinary! auditory and clear images, during the night...between 3:00 and 5:15 a.m. I drea med I was w alking outside when an extraordinary buzz-hum began. The sound was loud, riveti ng, and pervaded t hrough my body, throw ing me into a 'void or m ental isolat ion. ' The sound seeped into my 'ordinary' consciousnes s...a powerful sound. \"I looked u p, and a h uge , g ray, me tal [saucer-like] spac eship dr opped straight do wn f rom the clouds on my right,\" Jane c ontinued. \" I sa t down on a 'mes a' cross-l egged as i t sank to earth.

So c lear and luc id.\" Seven months later, Jane dec ided to undergo regressive hypnosis to explore some of her strange memori es and exper iences. In the fi rst session she r ecalled a hitherto- unremembered event from childhood, and in the second session s he examined t he UFO dream. Once she was in a trance state, Jane didn't describe t he onset of the \"dream\" as she'd recalled it.

This one had l ight hair, although the other s had hair of various jewel-like colors. They mentally disc uss ed the things s he \"knows\" but cannot access consciously. He told her that the knowle dge would \"come\" to Jane when s he w as \" ready,\" e xplaining that \"e ach en ergy h as to b e b uilt u p, strengthened, befor e it can wit hstand t he whol e thi ng. It has to be adjusted to move in different ways of coping and seeing, and that's not easy because there are clumps of resistance in all of us.\" When asked if this unexpected scenari o was r elated to the dream of the UFO and the desert-like mesa incident with which the regre ssion had begun, J ane said t hat it was , although she didn't make that connection clear. 'The tan w orld is a representation of reality,\" she said, \"and the different subtle shadings s how how they could e ach fade into one another to mak e a w hole, but yet are di ffere nt. I t is an actual place, yet it's a representation and symbolic. It is within our grasp. W e can reach it. I went there with help.\" Jane described the UFO as a device making \"an o bservation\" of he r. \"My ability to break out of the somnambulism and to speak s hows my s trength, and they were pleased, \" she said. 'They [the tall beings] c ame in then to esc ort me out of it because I had s hown that I could be str ong enough. \" \"Were you a ware o f b eing in the tan d ream in your physical body?\" the hypnotist asked, and Jane sai d she wa s. \"If someone had come to your house and looked i n,\" the hypnotist persisted, \"you would not have been there in your physical form?\" 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"\"I don't k now, \" she r eplied. \"I was really th ere, it was real. My body was there.\" Not m uch more wa s elic ited ab out the UF O dream i n the r egr ession. But in Jane's first hypnosis session she remembered a series of events in rather detailed c larity. This abduction occurred when she was a young ch ild stay ing with her grandm other, an d her first awareness of something strange w as seeing her \"Nannie\" collapse on the ground outside while hanging up the laundry. Suddenly, Ja ne felt that she was being watched and turned to see a group of four o r five entities coming toward her. When s he ask ed why they wer e there, s he was t old, Don't worry, you'll be all right. And the beings escorted her toward t he barn. \"What does your friend look like?\" the hypnotist asked. \"Is he as tall as you? Taller?\" \"Just a litt le,\" s he r eplied. \"He's yellow.\" Jane's m emory of the following events was patchy and confused. She thought the main entity led her into the barn wher e she was plac ed in som ething lik e a \"bu cke t\" and swung around. A fter this, she recalled bei ng physic ally examined, helped down naked from a table, and taken into a different room by the \"friend\" with \"dark, slanted eyes.\" \"It's round and bright, bare,\" Jane described. \"I see colors, just colors. The top is blue, dark royal blue. It's a pretty, blue ce iling. The fl oor tickles my fee t, tingly. W e w alk through the room and come t o wher e all the animal s are.\" When as ked m ore about the anim als , inc luding a deer w hich she pets, she suddenly skipped to a scene of her crying beside Nannie again, still i mmobile s lumped over the clothes basket. Once Jane was c almed down from this , the hypnoti st took he r back through t he ent ire sc enario. Th is time, Jane coul d see more ab out the exami nation and other detail s. \"When the buc ket st ops moving, wh ere are you?\" she w as as ked . 'They help me out and sit me on the table,\" J ane said. \"It' s th e table. I'v e always been good before. Wh y a re yo u crying so m uch? I don't know. He sa ys I'll g et over that. I won't feel s o bad, when I get older. \" \"What won't f eel so bad?\" \"Thei r comi ng, thei r vi sits. It's so kind. They look at t he right side and the left side. Th ey lay me down, pick up my legs one at a time. It tickl es. They pull my t oes. And rub their hands up my sides and s ay, Turn, so I tu rn.\" The exam continued, in which J ane was \" poked\" with an instrum ent that reminded he r of \"chapstick.\" Then she was taken into the colorful room and from t here to a third location. \"We go into the room w ith all the green, it's so pretty,\" she described. \"I see big p lant s and animals and colors, too, of flow ers and beauti ful trees. I see r abbits, and I see a deer, and a bird, and...uh, oh, oh, down there in t he wat er!\" 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"\"What water?\" \"There's w ater, a lot of water. It's like a huge swimming pool. Something's swimming in the w ater, but I want to see the deer. I walk over, I see its ey es.

Its head is real b ig, it's green,\" Jane sai d apprehensi vely, and then in a panic s he shouted, \"Oh! Oh! Ow, it's got me! Ooohhh! It has me by the neck! Ow! Let me go! Oh , oh! My ear! My ear hurts now !\" Jane w as so upset by the re coll ection that after she had regained a calmer state of mind the session was b rought to a close. Aft erward, she descr ibe d the wat er c reature as hav ing a long neck and some sort of \" knobs\" on its head. Something painful happened to her ear, and then the creature di sa ppeared back into the wat er. She r emembered nothing m ore, until the entities took her back to her grandmother , who then recovered consc ious ness. To date, whenever she has tried to read the transcripts o f both regressions, she becomes so phys ically and em otionally upset that sh e cannot do it. But these are fai rly mundane even ts within the abduction scen ario, and her overreaction may come from events which are still supp ressed in h er memo ry. Far more pleasant, or at leas t acceptable, have been t he telepathic communications and \"knowings \" that have come to Jane without the aliens bei ng present. T he very first message came on November 25, 1992, from which she recorded, \"I have suddenly underst ood that I m ust giv e my self to the Awak ening. I underst ood th is a s if it wer e be ing told to me. There is a strong sense of urgen cy. I must respect my m other and all other things. To not hurt things, to live and let live. The tim e will c ome when th ey will present thems elves to me in my realit y. Won't be long. A s angel s they are in the mists of our mind. Give myself to the awakening. Do things in a good a nd cal m matter, and ever ything will be okay.\" The second message, on December 1, gave i nstructions and warned her to prepare to photograph the UFO s, which show ed up as promi sed. On A pril 22, 1993, she had another revelation. \"I 'understand' I'm to get all my not es together for Karla and her work,\" she wrote. \"Wha t I have will be very h elpful to her and is to be given freel y as she asks. I'm t o make special efforts to shar e all with her. She is very i mportant as a voi ce t hat will introduc e i ncreased realization throughout the world. She is one of many who in troduce the awareness to awakening.\" The next message, on June 8, concerned some thing for w hich Jane felt she w as being prepared or taught. \"I understand if I m editate on m y prayer list for healing at l east once a day, then I will be shown r esults,\" she recorded. \"That is the next step in my 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"progr ession of ac tivation. H ow f ar it wi ll g o will be determi ned by my level of di scipline, passion, de sire, a nd will.\" On June 27, Jane w oke from a dream about U FOs, b ut she couldn't recall any details. She did recall, however, coming to partial consciousness in the mi dst of the dream and trying to retain its details for later when she wou ld be awake. But all she c oul d remember w as the briefest scene. \"At one point I was standing looking at myself, an d another time myself was behind m e,\" she w rote that m orning. B ut the n otes were interrupted just then as a sudden realization came into her mind. It w asn't exactly the same as when the previous \"communications \" occurred, but it felt akin to that. \"All of a s udden I can remem ber the dream less on giv en t o m e last night,\" Jane said. \"I t was illustrated and demonstrated to me the truth that I am trul y a s piritual bei ng animating a body. I am something separ ate from the body. T he body is a tool, and I am ent rapped in it . But I can s eparate from the body before death, and have done it many times, without conscious knowledge. I a m a p ure spiritual b eing when without the body, and I w ill be agai n. Pati ence is requir ed. I am a s piritu al b eing only animat ing a shell. The body i s nothi ng, the soul is all .\" On September 30, a telepathic communication told Jane that s he was now \"ready f or the next lev el\" and \" the beginning of other things.\" She was tol d that some suppr essed memor ies and infor mation would b e allowed to emerge \"so I may re trieve tha t which will carry m e forward.\" S he saw h erself a s \"a single mirror of manki nd, aware of choosing either to \"uplift\" or \"tear down\" by her actions and intentions. The following month, Jane ex perienced two m ore comm unica tions. \"I un ders tand I'm to attempt to rid myself of all violent and negat ive tendencies, to let go o f c ontrolling impulses,\" s he w as told d uring the first one. And the second one was simply, \"I understand truth is a lonel y terri tory. Truth is l onely. Ea ch to his ow n. To di sdain i s incorrect.\" Jane had a recent flashba ck that seemed to fulfill t he promise made in one of the communications, about the release of suppresse d m emories. It concerned the UFO \"dream \" of Dec ember 31, 199 2, and the saucer that transformed into a globe, came up close to her face, and forced her to fall. The new memories filled in the details m uch differently, however. After first watching a black saucer-shaped c raft drop \"from the clouds like a cookie cutter,\" Jane sensed \"se veral intelligences\" in the s hip. Next, she saw it descend and transform in to the sphere wi th f our legs and designs inscribed on its surface, from which she now sensed a single intelligence. In its t hird permutation, the obj ect \"rose up a nd t urned into a gray-b lack sphere wi th antennae\" but no l egs. \"I remem ber the dar k, gun-m etal-gr ay globe with a ntennae,\" she described, \"having an intelligent awareness of m e. W hen its attention came full on m e, it took me over and ther e was not hing b ut m e and it. Its physic al force was like a huge w ind wi thout noise pushi ng against me.

Were they tw o epi sodes of the same ev ent , or was on e me mo ry a co ntrive d sc reen fo r the other?

She f irst conta cted me after reading INTO THE FRING E and briefly d escribed a n umber o f incidents in h er experienc es that closely paralleled many things my family and I had witnessed. As in the case of Beth, P at, and Lisa, Angie remembered a bductions invol ving ap parentl y mili tary pe rsonnel before our contact, and since that time there have been several o thers of a most disturbing nature. When we first began to c orres pond, howev er, Angie was not at all concerned about the possibility of detrimental m ilitary activity. After all, the aliens who had been abducti ng her assured her that the humans in their com pany were \"controlled\" by them, and s ince Angie did not fear the aliens she likewise wasn't worried about the humans with them. Since tha t tim e, he r atti tud e has radicall y changed, f or very good reason. But before exam ining the mili tary encoun ters, i t is best to begin wi th some background about Angie and the alien c ont acts. Born in 1966, Angie has Ge rman and Scotch ancestry from her m other, and, since her father was adopted, she knows nothing about that side of her family. S he is married and oper ates a s mall cattle ranch w ith her husband, P aul , outsi de of a l arge city in T ennessee. Angie is artistically talented, working in a bstracts, lithog raphy, cartooning, and cl ay. Before her fi rst a lien abduction i n 1988, she knew v ery little about such things and had never thought they could be part of her life. She did recall a few odd incidents from her childhood when I questioned he r, includi ng a s tran ge eve nt w hen sh e w as f our. S he and her f ather were r iding in hi s van w hen a bli nding f lash of light filled the vehicle. Immediately after the flash, Angie remembered feeling as if she wer e in a l ong, gray tunnel, but nothing m ore. Sinc e t hat time, except for seeing a huge fi reball in the sky, she could not rec all anyt hing unusual in her li fe. Until the n ight of Jul y 24, 1988 , tha t is . Angie had gone t o bed as usual, and then she suddenly awoke to find herself outside in the dark, paralyzed, facing a g roup of beings unlik e any thing she' d ev er seen. \"They w ere frail, hairless w hite beings w ho had the most mesmerizing eyes,\" she told me, and t hen she wa s am azed to watch their \"catlike\" eyes \"wiggle\" and change shape. They stared at her, and she felt as i f they were reading her mi nd. 'This must be a dream,\" she said ov er and over. \"You are not having a dream,\" one of the beings told her telepathi cally. \"We wil l show you. You have to go a way w ith us fo r a li ttle while.\" He pointed with one of hi s thr ee fingers tow ard t he woods, and the ot her beings carr ied Angie in that directi on. Te rrified as she saw her house and husband re ceding, she begged the creat ures not to tak e her any further, but her pl eas were igno red. A ngi e's panic, combined with her p hobia of the dark, made her very a gitated, until the leader of the 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"group injected something in her left forearm. She began to pass out, and the last words she heard were, Just rel ax a li ttle. The next morning, Angie found two red dots in that place on her f orearm. \"That's w hen I accepted the possi bili ty that I'd e ncountered something physically genuine,\" she said. \"I did not understand its meaning, and I spent the rest of the day wonderi ng about the uncanny event , about how I react ed with fear becaus e t he woods seemed so dark and scary, and mostl y about those d inky three-foot-tall beings. Who were they? Angels? E lves? Fairies? Ghosts? Aliens? W hen I went to bed t hat night, their imag e was still fres h on my min d, but I did not have any thoughts about them ever returning f or me.\" But t he beings did r eturn, and they have continued to come back periodically ever since. For the next two nights, Angie had clouded memori es of be ing wit h the creatures, which could have been dismissed as dreams e xcept fo r the fact tha t she di scovered mo re r ed dots on her body af ter both nights. Then in A ugust she had a consci ous encounter, waking in bed to see two G rays in her room . I nstantly paralyzed and cal med by thei r \"h ypnotic eyes,\" she fl oated through the house with them and outside, to an unbelievable sight. \"It was a big, silvery disk with revolving red, gr een, and yellow lights,\" An gie said, \"suspended ab out two feet above the ground and it was noi sele ss. When I fi rst saw it, there w as no doubt i n my mind that it wa s a UF O. That's when I acc epted the possibility that the beings were aliens.\" This ti me, Angie was not afraid . In fac t, her curiosi ty was ar ou sed, so she steppe d forwa rd to touch the craft. But one of t he Grays leaped in front of h er and warned her not to get close while the craft was in the \"disc har ge phas e\" bec ause it could harm her. An opening appeared in t he craft, and Angie saw a handsome young man, wi th blond hair and a tan jumpsui t, standing inside. Teleported aboa rd the craft, as if \"sucked into a long tunnel of electric orange light,\" she felt separat ed from her body at that time, because she could see it \"tumbling and twirling along beside me and all the bones, veins, and internal organs w ere visible.\" Inside the craft, A ngie w as placed in a black chair wh ere the blond man \"scanne d\" her visually, induci ng a sensati on of orgasm . She asked i f he, too, w ere an alien, and the man smiled and nodded. The craft began to move, forcing her body back in the chair to her consternation, as she has a great fear of flying. \"Where are we?\" she asked, and then a s mall oval window appeared on the wall . Sh e looked out and saw \"thousands of brilliant stars in the midst of deep black space, but no Earth and Moon.\" Four G rays entered the room, w here one of them handed a case to the blond man. He removed a glowing green ball whil e two of the Grays floated Angie to an odd tabl e. The man put the ball on her abdomen and mo ved i t in a ci rcular pattern, growing w arm. Angie felt a \"tugging sensation\" in that area and asked w hat was bei ng done to her. 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" The man said she was \"ripe enough\" and would b e able to conceive. Angie told him that she and her h usband had been tryi ng unsuccessfully to have children, and the m an told her she had not done so because her \"blood, immune, and genetic s ystems\" o perated differently than ot her humans. \"Am I part a lien?\" she asked, confused. One of the Grays told her that s he had been \" altered a little\" to fulfill a special purpose. The blond man said they had produced a \"novel breed\" from ova they'd taken from her. He told her she was a \"Chosen One\" and that her children and others so c hosen would conquer the world through m astering the power of insinuations message she would be given in other encounters. Angie then became very sleepy and pa ssed out unti l 9 a.m. the fol lowing morni ng, back in bed. After th ese i ncredible incidents, Angi e s eem ed to undergo an interior change. \"My husband and other p eople st arted not icing I seem ed calm er and less talkative and daydreamed a lot,\" she told m e. \"My husband wondered what it was that I had been i nscribing into the new diar y I pur chas ed. I told him t hat I was only recor ding dreams. I desperat ely w anted to share my story with someone, but did not because there was no one in my personal s ocial c ircle w ho wasn't skeptical of such issues. I feared that if I told any of them, they would question my sanity. So I kept my secret fo r a long time to come.\" During the nex t few months, s he had onl y vague m emories or dream s of other enc ount ers, and after one of these she found four red dots on her abdomen in a diamond pattern. But UFOs were not the only craft to land on her property, for on November 23 she h eard the sound of helicopters and looked out to see two blac k choppers with Air Force insignia overhead. When one of them landed on her property, Angie gr abbed a coat an d r aced ou tside. But they zoomed away before she coul d reach them. This was the fi rst time helicopters had been in the ar ea, but it wouldn't b e the last. In February 1989, she had anoth er abduction in which she was called a \"Chosen O ne\" and was also shown a scene fa miliar from other abductee reports. On e of the aliens touched her forehead, she said, and \"a series of graphic images exploded\" in he r mind. She saw \" a reddish- gold des ert planet with two s etting suns,\" a \"galaxy,\" a \"blood-red moon and a f iery or ange sun exploding, \" and an \"under ground cit y\" befor e she blacked out. When she regai ned c onscious ness, an a lien told her their home was \"Cassiopeia in the heavens\" but that th ey had made a home for themselves on Earth before humans were cr eated. Af ter this, Angie passed ou t again and was returned hom e. Two days lat er, anot her helic opter c ircled the property, and a man who clai med t o work for the utility company arrived, aski ng to examine the two t ransformers on the farm. He said there had been many powe r failures in the ar ea, but Angie wa s sus picious since s he hadn't rec alled any suc h failur es nor had she cont acted the utilit y company. Eight nights after the last ab duction, Angie recalled w aking up in the back yard w ith four aliens.

He th en tol d her that she woul d soon \" have the power to make mental contact\" with other Chosen Ones and would be able to \"influenc e their minds,\" and then he touched her chest and she b lacked out. The next day when Angie went outside, she found a large circle in the grass which looked \"parched\" and sever al chunks of bubbl y bl ack me tal sl ag. E xcited by t his proof, Angie photographed the metal an d the ci rcl e, w hich di dn't di sapp ear fo r ov er a yea r and a half. Analysis of the meta l in 1993 showed it to be ordinary iron s lag. In March she had two \" cloud y\" me mori es o f abduct ions, b oth inv olving a bdo mina l procedures, and in one of them she s aw a group of \"daz ed\" humans i n the same room. O n M arch 23, Angie counted nineteen heli copters flying over the farm and thought she could make out Air Fo rce designations o n them. Ten days later, A ngie recall ed another abduction, but this one di ffered d ram atically from the previous enc ounters. She found her self out side i n the dark wi th a thin blue alien who \"mind sc anned\" her. Then five m en came out o f the shadows, four o f w hom w ere \"ordinary men wearing olive- green uni forms\" wi th \" crewcuts\" and the fifth was \"a dark-haired humanoid\" in a long khaki coat wit h many pockets. This man, Angi e said, \"touched the blue alien and it s uddenly shrank into a marble-sized orb of white light\" whic h t he hum anoid then poc keted. He told her that these beings, \"a nonphysical form of energy,\" wer e crea ted a nd controlled by his gr oup. \"Did you create humans, too?\" Angie asked, and h e confirmed this. \"What do you want from me?\" s he c ontinued. \"We want to talk to you abou t your life,\" he told h er. âThat's all? \" she aske d. âThere's more,\" he sai d, and one of the uniformed m en took Angie to a black van parked behind her garage. \"Is that a r eal v an, or is t hat your spaceship?\" she wondered. \"You c an't judge a book by its cov er,\" another man r eplied cryptically. Inside the van, Angie saw bench seat s, carpet, and a large control panel. The other men entered, and Angie wondered if they be longed to some military g roup. \"Are you a ll with the Ar my, Air Force, Navy, or Marines,\" she inquired. The oldest m an re plied, bu t sh e w as beg inning to hav e a hard time understanding ev erythin g he said. She thought he s aid t he gr oup belo ng ed t o an organization called \"High Shel f\" 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"which worked mainly in \"special underground stations.\" He also t old her that she and other \"Chosen Ones \" were part of a m ind-c ontr ol project, to \" carry in structions and temperance, via thought transference\" to other p eople. Once he answered her questions, he began an i nterrogation about her life. A ngie could recall only a f ew of the questions, however, in her altered condition. He asked, for instance, if she remembered the aliens coming to her when s he was y oung, which she di d not. A nd he asked about her views on life and death. After the i nterview , whic h seemed qui te l engthy, the man activated something on the control panel, and Angie found herself back in bed, fully alert a nd \"tingling all over,\" at 5:10 a.m. She quickly dr essed and ran outside to se e if they were still there, but the y ard was em pty. Thinking about all her enc ounters, Angie came to several conclusions. First, she now believed that there was something much bigger than \"m an's views and t heories and religions\" to the universe. And she believ ed t hat the aliens wer e carry ing out a \"psyc hic t ransformation\" with her and others for a good p urpose. Through the foll owing months, Angie had several mor e encounter s and UF O sightings. The most traumatic series of even ts began with an abduction in wh ich s he w as \"impregnated.\" Two weeks later, she took two home-pregnancy te sts whi ch proved positive, and she and her husband were elated. Angie d id not tell Paul about the alien impregnati on, since h e had not believed her previ ous accounts of sight ings and intr usions. Sh e thought the baby inside h er was a special gift from her alien friends, and, b eing unfamiliar with the typical a lien process of impregnation and subsequent retr ieval of the fetus, s he looked forward t o ca rrying the child to term and beginning the family which she and Paul desired. T hey had even selected names for the baby. But a month after the impreg nation encounter, Angie star ted having unusual physi cal symp toms: \"sweat ing\" and \"tingling\" during the day, and a pulsat ing sensation in the womb area at ni ght. Thi s continued fo r over two weeks, until on the morning o f July 4, Angie suffered a bloody, painf ul m iscarriage. \"It happened in m y bathroom,\" she said. \"After hours of heavy bleeding and terrible cramping, the fetus came out, in my hands.\" It wasn 't like a normal fetu s; larger, thre e inches long, devoid of sex organs, and had \" blac k, slanted\" eyes reminiscent of the white aliens she had encountered. Under a strange c ompulsion, Angie put the fetus in a jar of water and hi d i t in the barn l oft. Later she went back and found that the jar w as missing. Paul took Angie to th e doctor ri ght away, as she'd lost a lo t of blood and subsequentl y she had a \"D& C\" p rocedure. She couldn't understand why she' d lost t he baby, having taken excellent care of herself, and the loss was dev astating. At a much later date, Angie underwent two h ypnotic regressions, in which three of her experiences were examined . One of these was the loss of the f etus, an d in that regr ess ion Angie described a h itherto unrem embered bedr oom visit ation in the h ours before her miscarri age. Several beings and a large, floating b lue light e ntered the bedroom. While som e of the aliens bus ied themselves with Paul, two others carried out 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"an abdominal procedure on Angie, involving a small cylindr ical dev ice t hat \"c lick ed.\" Nothing further intru ded until September, when Angie awoke w ith a vague recollection of being on a c raft with her sister, Julia. That morning, Julia phoned and told her, \"I had the weirdest dream last night.\" She descri bed bei ng with human-l ooking ali ens in blue jumpsui ts in a curved, domed ro om, and she saw Angie there, too, in a silver jumpsuit like the aliens w ore. She recall ed Angie telling her, \"They want to g ive us eternal life.\" The same detail s had been part of Angie's m emories, and the two sisters got together to discuss t he shared \"dream s.\" Angie told her si ster then, for the first ti me, about her other encount ers, relieved to e nd the \"emotional i solation and f ear of ridicul e\" th at h ad kep t he r quiet be fore thi s. Her circle of confidants expanded in November , w hen her father told of se eing a dom ed, orange UFO while out in the Smoky Mountains with some friends. Angie and Julia shared their experiences w ith him, and that prom pted their father to open up even more. The three o f u s learned a lot that d ay,\" A ngie said. \"I told Dad about all of my alien encounters; Dad told us about his past encount ers and about our mother's e xperiences, too; I cried. That wa s the day w e learned t hat our parents have been involved with the aliens since before we were born.\" Intermittent abduct ions cont inued to occ ur. From D ecemb er 1989 to A pril 1992 , A ngie recalled fifteen events. In one, she was s hown a nursery of \"clones\" s imilar to other abdu ctee rep orts, and she wa s told that the al iens had \" program med\" her to hi de the fetus after her miscar riage. When Angie as ked if the aliens had restored the fetus to life, she found it hard to underst and the reply t hat its phy sical body ha d been stored and i ts soul recycl ed. In another, Angie was shown a \"clone\" infant as w ell as nine \"hybrid tots\" and was tol d they w ould be used \"to pre pare [humans] for the changes .\" When s he asked, \"What changes ?\" she was told it inv olved \" hum ans' spiritua l trans formation. \" One abduction dur ing th is time w as v ery s ingular, as Angie recall ed going to an underground facili ty that h er u niformed h uman e scort s aid w as in n orthern Arizona.

Throughout these encounters, A ngie had felt positi ve about her invol vement wi th the aliens, including, finally, the loss of her unborn child, which she believed was for a higher purpose. A nd i n the abduction she and Julia remembered sharing, Juli a had accepted Angie's statement about gettin g \"immortal life\" from the beings, so she, too, had a posi tive atti tude. It was surp ris ing, theref ore, that Julia was ext rem ely fright ened a month later when the s isters s potted a UFO. Returning from Georgia on December 29, they were driving along a state highway in Tennessee. At 7: 30 p.m. they saw t wo unu sual v ehic les. The fir st one, Angie descr ibed as \"an old spray-painted bus\" tr aveling v ery slowly, \"full of hippie folk,\" wit h the w ords \"Magic Bus\" painted across the rear. T he sisters laughed about it, but then the bus slowed to about ten miles per hour, and Angie could not pass it as they m oved up a hill. She and J ulia saw som e of the bus 's oc cupant s op en t heir wi ndows an d shout, and then one of them pointed upward. The girls looked in that direction and saw a bright blue object above the treetops ahead. It had a do me, wide rim, and bla ck, round porthol es. \"Angi e, l ook!\" Julia sh outed. 'That's a UFO!\" The hippie bus accelerated and was soon out of s ight, as Angie's Corvette came to a complete stop on it s own. A blue glow engul fed the car. \"Oh, God! It's behind us!\" Julia screamed in fea r. In Julia's account of the incident to m e, she w rote, \"When it came towards us, I got scared. And Angie told me ther e was nothing to be afraid of, but I still f elt afraid and got down in the floorbo ard of the car.\" There was a brief \"i ntermi ttent beeping sound/' A ngi e sai d, and \"then al l w as si lence and darkness.

Ten- twenty.\" Angie didn' t believ e her, but when she chec ked h er own watch, i t had the same time. Almost three hours had passed since they spotted the blue U FO, and the sisters didn't have a single memory of w hat transpired. In April 1992, Paul and Angie moved onto the c attle ranch, and an entirely new series o f myst erious events began. Their special ty-beef business was doi ng very well until something started killing off the cattle, and w ithin a year the losses a mounted to thousands of dollars. 96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"\"A small number of them had been mutilated,\" A ngie reported. \"One cow was missing a head, another had been di se mbow eled, and a bull cal f appeared as if he'd been ripped apart by a tyrannosaur. T he b odies o f s ome o f the m utilated ones had peculiar stigmata such as shaved places, clean and bloodless holes and gas hes. Ther e wasn't a single scratch anywhere on the rest of the dead c attle.\" Many of the ca ttle di ed i n F ebrua ry a nd Ma rch 1993, w hen othe r farmers i n the general area also r eported dead and mutilated animals . Reading about one of these reports, Angie c ont acted the paper and g ot in touch with a veterinarian who'd ex amined someone els e's dead ca ttle. In the first case, he r eported that the cattle had died of toxins of an u nknown source, and with Angie's cattle, all he could r epo rt was death from unknown caus es. The alien activity after this w as rather different than what had transpir ed befor e, and for the m ost part Angie was left with very cl oudy a nd incompl ete memories of the events. One abduct ion, howe ver, is w orth no tin g at some length . Waking on board a craft, naked on a table, Angie s aw humanoids and two di fferent kinds of Grays. Moment arily, two m ore hum anoids, in r ed suits, entered, and A ngie recognized t he blond one as the man she'd seen before. She asked if he had a name, and he told her \" Carl De Z an.\" He told her that it was time for her group of Chosen O nes to carry out their \"assigned tasks.\" This involved making contact w ith \"certain people t hroughout the world\" to \"collect data\" from their minds. And that data, in t urn, would then be c ollected from the minds of the Chosen Ones by the aliens. All of this would be done, he said, thr ough tiny implants in the head, devices that se rved many purposes. They could help the implant ed peopl e use their \"special senses,\" for instance, and stay in contact w ith one another t hrough dr eams. Besi des c ollect ing data, the im plants could also send instr uctions. When Angie asked about th e overall purpose-the agenda- she was t old that t hroug h \"tempering\" human mi nds, the ali ens w anted to remove \"fil th an d evil\" and \"negat ivity \" from humans. Having been giv en repeat ed lectur es about her s pec ial abilities as a \"Ch osen One, \" at one point Angie initiated an experiment w ith herself. \"I decided to test my mental powers by givi ng thought transference a try,\" she repor ted. \"I went to bed around 11 p.m. and concentrated long and hard to project m y image into m y sister's d ream. During the process, I drifted of f to sleep and soon found mysel f in a dream in which Julia was pr esent! \"I phoned my sister [the next morning] to let her know about my atte mpt at reachi ng her in her dream, but before I had a chance to say anything, she recounted the dream in full detail.\" Angie also decided to try hypnotic regressi on in order to uncove r anythi ng she could about the events she'd b een u nable to remember c onsciously. U ndergoing two 97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"hypnosis sessions, Angie was surprised to retrieve details o f a childho od encoun ter in one session. G oing back to age four, w hen she and her father had been blinded by a flas h of light while r iding in a van, Angie recalled being taken into a gray, cigar-shaped craft where she saw several men a nd women in white c oat s. One man with \" long, dar k blond hai r\" took charge of he r, carrying the crying child to a strange table. \"It's metal and has an edge around it,\" she d escribed, \"like f or blood to drain off. And there is something down at t he f oot, under the table, but I can't see it clearly.\" Acting in what she perceived as a \" hurried\" m anner, the man strapped her wrists down as she lay on the table and placed on her head a \"headband t hing\" w ith m oving red and yellow lights. The hypnotist instructed A ngie to view the scene from a distance, rather than reli ving it, and she obliged. \"I can see my hands twi tchi ng,\" she said. \"The wr ist ban ds are making my fingers twi tch and jerk. I'm lying there wi th t he headband on, and my eyes a re open. The pupils are dilated lik e I'm dead. \" She then described a procedure in whic h a clear t ube was inserted va ginally and filled with \"a pinkish liqui d\" as one of the wo men pressed on A ngie's a bdomen. When she was revi ved, the bl ond m an tr ied to \"jolly\" her out of her terrified state, and she was returned to the van, which ex ited the cigar-shaped craf t by flying out of the opening \"on its own,\" as Angie report ed. \"We're coming dow n to the road,\" she sai d, \"I can s ee it clear ly becaus e it's da ytim e, a nd the van lands smoo thly on t he road .

When she q uestioned him, he described an abducti on memory from that same night, although he didn't recall seeing Angie. In another, she was given informati on about ali en l ife in ot her p arts o f the galaxy, about their travel technology, and abo ut th eir hav ing cr eat ed lif e f orms on Earth, including humans.

In spite of this, she had not been upset by the t hree encount ers, and since t he in tercou rse had not been frightening , she wo ndered why t he man had induced the part ial paralysis and subsequent loss of consciousness. Four night s later, she went through an e ncounter t hat was far less pleasant. Angie went to bed very late that night, around 1:30 a.m., and folded her clothes n eatly on a bedside table before turning out the light. In what seemed like only a few minutes later, she awoke full y alert, lis tening to the sound lik e a je t engine t hat was loud and gett ing louder.

And she wasn't al one. \"W ith me were t hree ap parently frighten ed y oung wo men,\" Angie des cribed. \"One was lyi ng fa ce-down in the grass w eeping.\" Angie became frightened herself, for the first ti me sinc e her ini tial abducti on. \"My instincts sai d tha t we were about to be abducted by a force so great that we would not be able to control our situation no matter how hard we might pray to God.\" One of the other wom en, tall and plump and b rown-haired, started yelling, \"Here they come! Here they come!\" The sound grew unbearable as a strange-looki ng a irplane flew toward them and landed like a helic opter. Two of the wome n panic ked and r an into th e wood s, while Angie and the brunette stood frozen in place by fear.

She was told that t he milita ry group was i nvolved with some groups of aliens but not with two of the gr oups wh o had cont acted Angie . She said the military group's impl ants \"monit or how many times [ implante d abductees] com e in to contact with alien beings\" as well as recording \"the appr oximate l ocation of a pick- up.\" In the c our se of further pr ocedures, Angie was held down w hile the w omen inserted a probe into her left nostril. When they perfo rmed a second test, A ngie w a s t o l d t h a t t h e a l i e n i m p l a n t s h a d \"depr ogrammed\" those from the military group. Her next r ecollection is of being taken to a room with other women where they were all interroga ted by an older man in an office r's uni form who m sh e remembered as a major. A ccording to A ngie, the majo r said, \"Y ou peopl e are goi ng to tell me everything. I don't want to be an asshole and forc e it out of you, but if that's w hat it takes....\" Three women were quest ion ed before Angie, and w hen her turn came she was asked about the informati on she'd been given by the Whites and G rays about their implants. She told him that she'd s een four kinds of Grays and didn't know which ones had us ed t he implants on her. \"You're l ying,\" the major replied. \"I 'm goi ng to a sk you one mo re time .\" \"Which aliens do you want to know about?\" she a sked. \"I told you I've been with a lot of the m.\" \"Start with the slender gray aliens,\" he told her . \"Did any of those talk about implants?\" 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"\"I can't thi nk,\" she sa id, \"yo u're con fusing me .\" It was her way of evadin g his questions because she fel t it was \"none of hi s business.\" He ordered that she be taken to another area called the \"probing room,\" w here she lost consciousness a fter receiving another injection. Afte r e ach abdu ction by the mili tary g rou p, Angie grew m ore an d m ore ap prehe nsi ve and fearful. When I asked her about any positive help she m ight have recei ved from the aliens she thought of as her friends, Angi e's reply, in a January 2, 1994, letter, showed how muc h more she now questioned her ex periences than she had done in the beginning. \"Since that mili tary group stepped into t he scene,\" she w rote, \"there haven't been any aliens to come to my resc ue. I constantl y pray for help and guidance f rom the good sources in the universe, but t here just hasn't been any he lp on my par t. I don't know which aliens are trying to help me, and whic h aliens are out to dec eiv e me. The s piritual growth and all the good t hings I've experienc ed may not be link ed to my [alien] ex peri ences. Maybe i t's just somethi ng I brought about all by myself.\" Apparently there was someone else aware of her fe elings, because si x days after she wrote that letter Angie had an alien abducti on for the fi rst ti me in mon ths , w hich seemed designed, in part, to placate her. After going to bed on the night of January 8, she woke up to find herself on board a cra ft in the c omp an y of a Gr ay. A ngi e said she was neither paralyz ed nor in a tranc e st ate and c lear ly r ecalls the a lien using some device to \"locate and reactivate an i mplant\" by i nserti on of somethi ng into her ear. S he was then told they were finished with her and she would be returned home. \"Before I go,\" Angie said, \"you are going to tell m e what thi s is all about.\" The alien replied tha t info rma tion had ju st been placed in t he im plant and t hat Angie would \"know everything in due time.\" But she insisted on asking m ore ques tions. When she asked why the military personnel had given her s o many inje ctions, th e alie n said that they used \"tranquiliz er drugs on all recruits t o prevent them from running away.\" She said the alien also apologiz ed for the military group's \" indiscretions\" and told her she would not be m ade to watch any more \"killing events.\" Angie had her doubts about this and t old t he alien t hat the warning had been for her not to \"talk,\" but that she had conti nued to \"tal k\" since then. The ali en r eplied that she should d o w hat s he felt w as important . \"He said the milit ary people have been untruthful about most of what they've told me,\" she r eported, \"and that some of their demonstrations were mere illusions. It's part of t heir cover-up.\" She also questi oned hi m about the spac e cr aft an d wa s to ld that it operat ed on \"the power of the mind.\" But she w as unable to as k anything m ore bec ause f our Grays entered and led her through a corridor to a n exit from the craft just then. \"I saw that we were i n a big ha ngar at some base,\" s he said, \"and there must have been more than fifty m ilitary people there.\" 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" She was told that those peopl e would return her to her home, but before she could go over to them, one of the aliens used some device to render her unconscious. Her next memory was of being bac k in her bedroom, and that da y she had r ecurrent bouts of pain on the side of her head wher e the probe had g one into her ear. As w ith most abductees, there i s no en ding yet to Angie's story, nor a clear understanding of the agenda behind her repeated abductions. But there are certainly a number of important questions raised by her account, w hich has onl y been parti ally present ed h ere. Compared to other abduction scenari os, Angie's c ontains many of the typical elements: various p hysical exams, fetus-retrieval and baby presenta tion ; vi sion s o f the desert world; sexual ac tivi ties; trai ning a nd instruction sessio ns; telepo rtatio n me thods; the \"black box\"; punctures and bruises ; and im plants, to name a few. Similarly, her reports of activities and details in the e ncounters involving a pparently m ilitary pers onnel cont ain m uch that is familiar from othe r accoun ts. What is very untypi cal, howev er, is the richness of her recollect ions. I n most ab ductions , the per son can only remember sm all parts of the total event, an d this is true for Angie, too, in m any of the en coun ters. B ut in some of them she seems to have been allowed t o retain more than the usual lev el of awareness. Either t hat, or she just naturally is not as sus cep tible a t ti me s t o the mind-control p rocedures w hich a re u sed to suppress abductees ' memories . The abundance of informat ion she received is al so u ntypical. Certainly there are many abductees who have been instruct ed on various topics in the same w ay A ngie had been. But she has managed to retain a n enormous amou nt of this information which can be correl ated wi th the numer ous but m ore incomplete reports from other cases, on such topics as m ind-control methods, alie n-human c ollus ion, and implant c apabilities. Still, s he does n't recall ev erything, as s he has noted and as hypnosi s has shown. S o wh y is s he allowed to recall these parti cula r things? Is this p rogrammed or accidental? If programmed, by whom, and for what purpose? Further questions are raised by a contradiction in t he details of two related recent events. It concerns the contr overs ial subj ect of cover t cooper ation bet ween hu man agenc ies and alie n groups. W hen Angie and the other women were quest ioned by th e major, h e focused at one poi nt on what Angi e knew about the im plants of the Whit es and Grays. This implied that h is organization was not familiar with those kinds a nd thus not allied in any way. Angie had also been told th at the mili tary group wo rked wi th some aliens but not with all of them. But in the January 8 abductio n, Angie was aboar d a craft w ith o ne of the G rays, w ho proceeded to discuss the m ilitary group in a negative manne r. This implied that he was no t alli ed wi th them . Y et, when that craft lande d, Angie s aw t hey were inside a m ilitary facility. Some further explanation is c learly called for to resolve the confusion. From what she has observed of relations between our military organization, whatever its aegis, and their alleged 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"alien allies, Angie thinks they are at odds in some ways. Her impressi on is that the hu man organization is responsible for the extreme c over-up activities rather than the aliens. But this is based in part upon one of the al iens' statement that they h ad n o concern a bout their presence being known-a dubious statement, however, given thei r em ployme nt of m emory suppression and virtual reality illusio ns. Given the aliens' VRS capabili ties, there is always a question of the reality of these events. Just recently, however, A ngie's husband told her he'd had a s trange dream that some men broke into the house and took her away. U nhappily, she had had the same dr eam t hat night. Angie is keenly aware of the unanswered questions. \"Although some of my exper iences wit h them have l ed to a posi tive transfo rmation,\" she once said, \"the ali ens certainly are not any more open wit h me now tha n they were five years ago.... \"Until I under go hypnos is and some trut h is r ecovered, there's no way of my really knowing right now which aliens are trying to help me and wh ich a liens are tryi ng to deceive me.

She wrote, as she ex plained, because it was the only w ay to get free of a compulsion that had begun in November 1992, afte r an e xtraordinary d ream. The following week, she bo ught and read my book, and then began the compul sion to wri te me and share the dream. Amy, how ever, as I would find out, has a strong s ense of independence, self-control, logic, s kepticism, and an admirable stubbor nness. She resiste d the \" ridiculous\" compulsion for several m onths , but by April she was ready to get it out of her system and reason ed that writing th e letter would end it. In the fi rst part, A my descri bed some unusual ev ents that c orres ponded with things I related in INTO THE FRIN GE. Thes e inc luded odd ph on e behavior, which she humorously a ttributed to \" The Phantom of the Opera-tor, \" and unexplained electrical problems and noises in the house. None of t he unusual experiences were attributed to alien activi ty, a glaring absenc e in comparison to the other co nta cts I'd gotten. But then she began to describe the dream. In the first scene, A my a nd h er daughters were in a campground where \"huge tarantulas\" c hased them. They got in the car and drove away, but the car started flying upward, over the trees, w here she saw a huge moon. \"In front of the moon,\" she w rote, \"I saw the silh ouettes of some small, thin b eings. They had big heads lik e the aliens I've heard abou t, and they wer e m oving about in front of the moon or light that g lowed behind them. One turned and looked at me, a nd I saw large, black eyes. I wasn't afraid of him. I thought, Well , I've never actually seen one of them -now I know w hat they look like.\" She heard a l oud noi se approaching, and th en she f lew o nto a m etal-roofed hous e. \"I knew the metal might be hot,\" she noted, \"so I knew not to touch it.\" A my was on the second story, where she looked through \"large windows \" into one of the rooms. There she saw a group of men talking ex citedly and heard a softer, female, voice telling them to \"calm dow n because there was work to do.\" The men l ooked human, but the female was part of \"a group of non- Eart h r epr esent atives.\" When s he was br ought int o the r oom , she said, \"The humans introduced me to a female alien wearing a white plastic mask so that her appearance would not fri ghten the others and so they wouldn't f ocus on her eyes. E ven though she w ore a m ask, I could see her eyes th rough the hol es in the mask. They we re big, black eyes. From that point on, I remember being right next to her, and her face stay ed very close to my face...very intense!\" The first part in the campground w as either a natural dream or a screened sequence, but the illusory force rapidly disappeared as she m oved from the campground to the room in the alien's c ompany. 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Amy said the alien expl ained that her race had b een doing things to humans that they shou ld n ot be doing. \"She and seve ral groups of her race wanted to stop the 'abuse' of the humans by her race.

T he o ther h umans in the room w ere ex-pilots, military o fficials, and other professionals .\" I was ri veted, now , because Am y's account echoed that o f information I'd recently received, from two widely separated s ources, about a covert program or e ffort by certain parties in the intelligence and m ilitary organizations to resist alien abdu ctions and t o assist abductees in certai n ways. There was no doubt in my mind that some in the m ilitary had an active h and in monitoring and question ing a bductee s, a s m y h usban d C asey h ad g one through such an experience. Other abductees-including Leah Haley and Debbie J ordan- had also reported contacts, in trusions, and kidnappings by human, seemingly military, agents, and t her e was object ive ev idenc e in some c ases to ba ck up the r eports. Bu t this w as a far cry from acc ounts of hum an agents actively he lping ab ductees, much less a coalition of human and alien parties w orking against the abduction agenda, as the information alleged to come fr om the intelligence community has claimed. So far as I knew, this claim was not generally k nown fr om publi c ufol ogical m aterial. Yet here it was in Amy's dream. Her account went on to say t hat the masked alien d ominated Amy's attention, \"putting\" information directly into her mind. \"She explained all kinds of things , but I d on't remember it all,\" A my w rote. \"I think I reme mber my role in the plan, but I don't lik e knowing so I forget. I do n't want to remember! \"After s he told m e about thos e things, she t old me a bout implants. She put a thin, penc il-lik e metal i nstrument in my right ear and I thought, Ohl This is gonna hurtl but I couldn't move or st op her. T o my s urprise, it didn't hurt!

It was a \" dark, cylindrical\" objec t ab ou t \"three centim eters long\" with \"someth ing sticking on the end of it like v ery fine wires.\" The alien then ex plained how the i mplant operated. \"She show ed me the thing she had pulled out of m y neck,\" Amy reported, \"and said, This is em bedded d eep into the spinal cord.

Cl ear ly, Am y ha d written the letter only to m ake the c ompu lsion \" stop bugging\" her. I didn't need an inv itation to r espond, howeve r, as her information was too compe lling to ignore. Amy had com mented t hat \"certain elem ents of m y dr eam resembled parts of your book, \" but when I read back t hrough the dr eam I c ould s ee v ery litt le actual similarity o ther than the facts th at my hu sband had seen m ilitar y people in an abduct ion and that I had recalled an ear implant. I suspected there w ere other details she hadn't shared, however, because peopl e very often hold back from the ent ire truth when first \"test ing t he wat ers\" wit h som eone t hey don't know. And not only was I intrigued by the content of the dream, I w as also cu riou s to know more about A my's pot ential si tuation because she lived i n the very same city where my fam ily and I li ved during the exper iences I wrote about in F RINGE. F inally there was the fact of her compulsion to contact m e rather than some other research er, and the possibility that o ur contact was being di rected. I got her number from information and phoned as soon as possible. I learned that she was a d ivorced mother of two young daught ers who had just fi nished h er master's degree in counseling. She was bo rn in Dallas in 1953, of S cotch, Irish, E nglish, and French (\"Cajun\") ancestry and had lived most of her life in the Metroplex area. Amy was truly surprised by m y interest. In fact, as she later confessed humorously, she wondered if I were \"o ne taco short of a full combo plate\" for being \"inter ested in a dream.\" Amy did agree, however, to share more i nformation about many of her experiences, which she confessed were rather \"fri nge-like\" even though t hey didn't in consciou s r eality involve aliens or UFOs . I asked her to describe any past unusual events, of any sort, and a fe w weeks later she c omplied, with a list of psychic, dream, tel epathic, a nd miscellaneous ex periences. \"It was a lot har der [to make the list] than I expected,\" she said. \"It was like trying to see through a d ense fog. I've a lways k ept these things a t a d istance from my awareness .\" That distance was r apidly diminishing, a nd in the course of the next several months, we explored together her memories and the acc ounts found in the j ournals she had kept for many years. Amy's prog ressi ve sel f-re discove ry is a sto ry of i ts own . layer after layer of repression and denial wer e stripped away as she read back through the 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"journals and realiz ed that some power ful phenomenon had been part of her life from the begi nni ng. Even as young as four, A my had a feel ing of \" influence\" from an un seen source.

In adolescence Amy called this force the \"Council.\" \"At f irst I only hear d t hem t alking to one anot her, n ot to m e,\" she explained. \"I hav e only heard them audibly a few times, like w hen they told m e m y m other was going to die (she did) and other events t hat would happen in the future (the events did h appen),\" she explained. \"I usually s ens e a dialogue o f symbols, images, and concep ts. Wh en I 'listen,' I forget how to speak, words cease to exist, and I forget w hat using vocal cords feels like. I call it the 'language without words.' No trance states.\" She also had a brief yet vivid me mory of seeing a s mall, dark figure move rapidly into her bedr oom doorw ay a nd crouch dow n one ni ght. A nd w hen she w as ten, Amy recalled walking alone into a field near h er house very early one morning. She h ad no idea w hy she was going there, and she couldn't remember what happened when she arr ived nor much about her return home. In 196 5, Amy dreamed of be ing in the back yard and waving goodbye to a UFO hoverin g above her, and the next moment she wo ke up surprised to be in h er bed. The dream fel t so real that she g ot u p to see if the UFO was still nearby. It shoul d be recalled, incidentally, that 1965 was a major \"fl ap\" year for U FO sightings and encounters throughout t he c ountry. A few months later, Amy went through a sudden int ernal change of at titudes and interests, began to study the sci ences, and bl ossomed i ntellectual ly in school . The psychic el em ent also gr ew in creasingly stronger, and in her later teenage years Amy started having many dreams of an unk nown \"lady\" teaching h er intensely about a number of thi ngs, beginning with levitation. A lthough s he c alled them d reams, the teaching sessions had a real effect on Amy, and she once accidentally levitated a bottle of shampoo and a lmost frightened hersel f to death. When th e sessions began to include instructions on affecting electrical systems, Amy somet imes wit nessed the physical, external effects of her ability on appliances in her e nvironment. This is als o the t ime when s he ac cepted t he f act that her ex istence w as somehow bei ng guided by the Council. She w as led to st udy certai n subjects and was i mplanted with many concepts and ideas ab out time, space, physics a nd other complex t houghts . Altogether, in fact, Amy became aware of a sense of destiny and purpose she couldn't understand but could only feel as a certainty. \"I'm scared,\" she noted in her journal for January 1971, \"because something so unknown and pow erful is pulling at me, every mome nt I'm caught off guard and pulled. I'm being pulled to a state or level of mind I cannot fight...eventua lly I'll go, but in order that I won't be pulled under I've got to prepare.

I have always felt my p urpose, but I never knew it.\" Much of what she receiv ed came not in words but i n images and concepts. There was one statement, however, in which the words were clear: I am I. I am m any. We are many. I am not. Amy said this statement w as a sort of \"riddle\" about the Council. \"It referred to my exist ence as an indiv idual (I am I), my u nion with all minds (I am many), my absorption into the Oneness (We are many), and my identity as One (I am n ot). It is repeated often in m y diaries. It's sort of like an 'oath,' 'pledge/ or understanding.\" It is also quite reminiscent of messages given to L isa and Anita, the They are you-you ar e them told to Lisa and the IRU-URI communication Anita received during a \"questio n and answer\" meditation. Amy continued to have the training-ses sion d reams, recorded in volumes of journals, in which she was shown how to perform levitation, affe ct ele ctrical systems, and m ove through sol id objects. Looking back through the journals, she turned up a wealth of evidence showing the long-term involvement of unknown forces in Amy's life. Some of these details, in spite of her insistence that she had no recollection of being abducted, did indicate probabl e alien activi ty in the mi dst of it all . Indic ators of alien inv olvem ent such as ti me gaps a nd UFO sightings were in her journal and in her memory, although she had downplayed m ost of these ev ents . Bes ides the missing-ti me epi sode and the small crouching figure she'd seen at age seven-which was accompanied by her eye being ma tted shut the next morni ng-there was also an i ncident at age fifteen of an unexplained physical presence i ntruding upon h er. Staying with her niec e one nigh t, Amy felt t here was \"something\" in the b edroom before she went to sleep. She turned the light back on to look, but no one w as visible. After going to sleep, she had a strange, f rightening dream about a family trying to rea ch the spirit of a dead rel ative, and w hen the peopl e i n the dr eam s tart ed s creaming at one point, Amy started scream ing, too, and wok e up. \"I fel t someone kicki ng or jabbi ng me in the bac k, the whole bed was shaking, the canopy was flapping, and I felt someone/ something in my room again. I r an...to my mother's room and told her, and she k issed me and sai d it was just a bad dream.\" It was s o upsetting, in fact, that she refused to sleep in that r oom for two weeks. Other s uspicious dr eams wer e rec orded thr ough the years, includ ing t wo in 1977 that hinted strongly of an alien enc ount er beneath a s creen me mory. Amy s aid she dr eam ed \"of being called out of my hou se by a small boy standi ng in the wooded park\" nearby. \"He took my hand, \" she sa id, \"an d we walk ed into the park at night.\" The descri ption of the second dr eam was m ore detailed. \"I just dreamt a 'lady-doctor' gave me a shot, a tranquilizer,\" she noted in an April 1977 entry.

In some ways it s eem ed to fi t the screening phenomenon behind whic h abduct ions ar e oft en hid den, but it also seemed to have a very actual and \"hum an\" elem ent t o it. That was not the case, howev er, with a dream Amy recorded on M ay 27, 1981, and it was here that the indication of alien activity became palpable. \"I had the most unusual dream the ot her night,\" she n oted. \"I don't ever remember dreaming such a d ream before. My body w as fl oating hori zontally t hrough the h ouse. I've d reamt o f flying before and such, bu t always vertical and always m ixed w ith unreal elements.

I saw the wall s go by, and each det ail was as it rea lly is . I began to not e the lack of u nconscious symbols as in a dream and felt alarm. I became frightened at the moment I felt it was not a d ream. I felt suddenly sucked back into m y bed -through the wall ?!\" Amy dr ew a pict ure of the sc enar io as s he'd r emembered it in 1981. \"Of all the dream s I've ever had,\" she w rote, \"I'd say that was not a dream! It seemed real, it looked real, and it felt real. I don't know how, but I know I woke up ex actly at the point I drew in the picture. I remember going thro ugh the window in the back door... I remember going u p through the tree limbs. That's a ll I remember until I felt 'sucked' back into m y bed.\" The details of her \"dream\" were exactly like those report ed in many abduct ion onsets, and this, coupled with the earlier possible mi ssing-time episode and other indicators, pointed to alien invo lvement wi th A my. She had a conscious UFO sight ing t he f ollowing ye ar, in July 1982, wh en she was living in the north Texas city where my famil y and I had also lived-at the same time, in fact, thoug h un acqu ainted wit h o ne anothe r.

She said she wa s o utside in the daytime wh en she s aw t he f ive craft approaching, and that she had called out to a neighbor to look at them, too, and then had w alked around h er apartment still watc hing them. But la ter , Amy told me tha t \"something weird\" o ccurred during that dis cussion. \"I didn't tell you, but it has bothered m e sinc e,\" she said. \"I remember seeing the UFOs coming toward m e as I sat in front of the apartment s.

My telescope was still packed away.\" Unfamiliar with the screeni ng practices employed d uring abductions, Amy couldn't understand how there c ould b e d iffering m emories o f the s ame time s pan. One 'memory track' contains the conscious par amet ers of the event: init ial sight ing of the UFOs, calling to her neighbor, walk ing toward the back of t he apartments, and seeing the craft fl y away . W hat i s m issing from this track is the c ont inuity from the poi nt w here she sees the UFOs directly over her, to the point where she is watching them depart- a miss ing-tim e episode. The second 'memory tra ck' apparently provided a f iller for that time gap. This memory tells her that she watched the UFOs through either a telesc ope or b inoculars in that interim, w hich would have n ecessitated her goi ng into the apartme nt at some poi nt and unpacking a box to get the telescope, or g etting binoculars, and going back outside, where her conscious m emory picked up again. But this clearly didn't happen in reality, no matter what the second m emory track told he r, for the box was still pa cked and she did not ev en own binoc ular s. Som ething els e happened in the time gap which she was not allowed t o recall correctly, which is standard operating p rocedure in an abduction. The event was confusing to A my, as were the dreams she occasion ally had of waving farewell to a UFO. In one such dream from the w inter of 1988, she w as with her daughters in a field behind their a partment, waving goodbye to the UFO. \"When I woke up in bed,\" she said, \"I was still c old from being outs ide. I got up and went to make sur e the kids wer e back in bed, that's ho w real it seemed to me. In all of these previous events and dreams and memori es , A my had recal led nothing about actual a liens or being inside a U FO. T he d ream o f N ovember 1992, however, w here she clearly saw the gray, masked female \" non-Ea rth representative,\" took her, reluctantly, to a m uch m ore intense level o f recognition that the alie n phenomenon was a part of h er life. And when Am y realiz ed how num erous and co mpl ex the unusual events had been sinc e her chi ldhood, she de cided to explore some of those m emories through regressive hypnosis. As a counselor, she was f amiliar wit h the theo ry of r egression wor k, but s he had nev er exper ienced it. Am y ar ranged t o m eet wit h Bar bar a Bartholic in the summer of 1992 and w ent through two regression sessions, hoping to learn more about the part of her l ife that had been kept from her. In the first r egression, they explored some early childhood and adolescent memories, but it was extremely difficul t for Amy verbally to relate m uch of what she recalled in the trance state. It bec ame apparent that Amy's respo nse was inhibit ed by a s evere bloc k against tal king about her experiences, especially when she was able t o rem ember a thr eat made t o her by a Gray w hen she was very young.

She als o briefly remembered an experie nce a fe w year s later, of a huge cr aft of som e sort hovering just above her father's garden. She told Barbara that she wa s look ing at it ver y closely, wa nting to pu sh it away , but so meh ow she re ceived a clear imp ression that said, \"Don't touch.\" Amy said she did not w ant to go into the craft, but she was taken inside, where she saw the s ame Gray who had threaten ed to kill the c at. \"I saw myself talking to someone inside it,\" she said. T wasn't suppo sed to tell. This 'guy' telling me they would kill my cat w as inside i t. We were near t he doorway, and he was taller than I and his face was r ight up in m y fac e.\" Next, she and Barbara explored the memory she had at age fi fteen of something jabbing or kicking her and the bed shaking. \"During the session,\" she said l ater, \"I saw myself going to the back door. I couldn't understand because I looked s ort of ghos t-like and I w as floating, not walking.\" As she tried to look at this event, howe ver, that same scen e kept repeating, of her going t o the door and r eaching f or the knob, and she could not get past that point. \"I guess it was t oo hard to look at,\" she said. \"I remember the actual feelings of some thing in my roo m and bei ng kick ed or j abbed in m y back- it felt so real. It was te rrifying!\" The third episode they explored involved a c hildhood \"lesson\" about religion. \"'C hurche s are no t God',\" she reported being told, \"'statues and pictures a re not G od.

'That I'm not supposed to [believe],\" she said. \"I can pretend to be co nfirmed. I have to pretend that I b elieve it, say the prayers.\" In the second session, A my retrieved a brief r ecollec tion of a not her \" dream \" encounter with a Gray she had in April 1993. \"I had dreamt that some U FOs were picking people up here and there, \" she told me later. \"Certain peopl e, not at random.

It was like looking through the eyes of a G ray! If I think of it as I am-human-they seem cold and uncaring. If I remember the way it felt to be one of them, in the dream, it is not cold, not uncaring, just the way it is.\" In the hypnosis session, Amy could see the two of them in the bedroom, engaged in telepat hic con versa tion, and fee ling a n ol d ki nship w ith t he e ntity. When Barbara asked why t he Gr ay was t here, A my said, \"I'm not supposed to know.\" \"Ask what you are supposed to know,\" Barbara s uggested. \"He said in the next decade peopl e will be e xpected to think the same,\" she reported, \"being taught to think the sa me, like them. Make them e asier.\" Expanding later on what she was told, Amy said t hat in the coming decade the aliens doing the abductions would also promote a program in whic h p eople will be \"taught to think the same. The sad part was that everyone will think it's normal and it is their idea. Even bei ng an 'indivi dual' will seem real but not in actuali ty. He and other aliens are trying to stop t he pr ocess. It's been goi ng on for a long ti me already.\" Under hy pnos is, as Amy tr ied to ex plain th is information, she suddenly said, \"He t ells me to remember the rules. I'm t rying. He was trying to help me reme mber. De pa rture from the program will result in s ynapse dam age. It's so hard, without words, with w ords.\" âWhat was that about ?\" Bar bar a ask ed. \"Do what y ou know to do,\" Amy parroted the stateme nt of rules fr om the Gr ay, \"be hum an, be what you are. Rule number two: No me mo ries, rule number t wo.\" These \"rules\" wer e given to Amy v ery ear ly in her e xperiences with unidentified entities, and they alw ays in cluded a program to i nhibit her tal king a bout these events. An entry in her journal at age s event ee n records one of the \"rules \": \"I must not repeat previous mist akes.\" Am y said the mistake she w as not supposed to repeat was the \"mistak e\" of telling her mother about the things she had e xperienced. The fi rst ti me as an adult when she tried to tell someone el se, external interference stopped her, as the journal entry for December 16,1979 shows. \"I was w riting a letter to my boyfri end toni ght,\" she recorded. \"I was listening to the radio.

It w asn't until she searched back through the old journal s and saw entry after entry about not \"talking\" that she fina lly acknowledged the evi dence of possibl e programmed control . Her m emor ies of the Novemb er 1992 dream-event were much more detailed, and easily discussed, as if the programmi ng were ineffe ctive, at least to a point.

She also realized that she was with them and the spidery probe, for par t of the encounter, in her o wn apartment. But the m ost important information to emerge concerned the implants. When she described the fles h-colored object removed from her ear, she told B arbara that it was used as a transmi tter and moni tor. Amy said that the m asked alien also explained the pur pos e of the implant she removed fr om the s pine. \"She said that i t short-ci rcui ts and it can kill!\" Amy said. 'They can kill as m any as they want. It's in the neck . It's old, but som e people hav e t hem . When th ey want to kill them, they...I don't like that thi ng.

She gave detailed descriptions of the scene i n the dining ro om, where she saw the probe accompanying the three me n. After being introduced to the m asked alien, she was nex t aw are of bei ng taken into a large, underground room. She was led by two beings into the room, noticing the rough rock walls that proved she was below ground leve l. At that time she lived di rectl y across the street from a FE MA underground f acility, and that facility h ad u nde rgon e a ma ssive expansion, both above gro und with numerous antenna arrays and new buildings, and below the ground as well. But there was no way of knowing if she were in that facility or somewhere else. Amy sk etched the r oom in the facility wh ere she and the men were with the masked aliens. She had s melled a certain odor during the hypnotic r ecollection, resembling \"polish remover,\" wh ich came from \"a bl ack ribbed tube on the side of the r oom.\" The masked al ien told he r it hel ped the ali ens present to br eathe better. And when questi oned about evidence of a m ilitary atmosphere in the facility, A my s aid she didn't observe any. She had more t o say about the humans, too, especially the silver-haired leader she nicknamed \"Ol' Slit Eyes.\" \"Ever since the hypnosis session,\" she r emarked, \"the image of Ol ' Sli t Eyes has stayed wi th me , vividly. Once you 'tal k' that wa y, yo u always feel t he link. I get the feeling Ol' Slit Eyes is eit her in our g overnment or some high position in the military,\" she added. \"People see him every day but don't know who he really is.\" As for the other two m en, she said, 'The feelings I got from th ose three guy s was deep sadness. They were des igned like we ar e. They were watching me ' talk' w ith Ol ' Gra y and asses sing how I handled t he information and my 'loyalty .' It was just a feeling I caught from t hem.\" Conce rned abou t w hat sh e r eme mbered bei ng t old of the im pla nt's plac em ent and functions, A my w ent to medical text s for i nformation about the cerebellum and medulla oblongata, the locati ons identi fied for t he im plant s.

The cerebellum w as identified as the control source for muscle tone and equilibrium, as well as v oluntar y m ovement s, c oor dinat ion, and even the voca l cords-which, Amy noted, mi ght explain the p hysical difficulty some abductees experienc e when t rying to discuss their encounters. T he information corresponded with the control s the masked alien said were fu nctions o f the implan ts. 117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"After the No vember 19 92 dr eam-event , Am y continued to recall several other dream- memories. She had sudden flashback memories and also w itnessed more overt evidence of alien intrusions. S he had m ore dreams of moving through solid o bjects, one involv ing her daughters, and Amy said she w as not \"happy\" about seeing entities with them, although s he felt the tall beings standing there with them were \"quiet,\" \"wise,\" and \"r athe r nice. \" Sh e dreamed of being aboard a craft, again with masked a liens, who said that humans were going to be told \" who and what they really ar e\" as well as \"the truth about every one.\" In anot her dream, s he was made to f eel that the \"government\" was \"going to kill\" her for talking about what the government was doing to people. During one \"teaching dream\" Amy woke up and could actually hear the voice of the \"lady\" talking in her head. \"It is not a dream!\" s he noted in her journal . 'Tried to write what the 'lady' was saying, hea rd her say, 'NO!' and suddenl y began forgetting . Tried to write fast but hand went numb . Very ti red all day, t ook a nap-more teaching dreams.\" One of the m ost di sturbing dreams occu rred in June 1993, where Amy said she \"had the vivid sensation o f being held still by wires or tubes going into my head.\" Everythin g about the dream felt real. \" I was pissed!\" Amy said. \"I could actually feel something going into my head. I want ed to pull them out, but I couldn' t get my hands up to my head, m y hands wouldn't move . 'Then I heard som eone say, in my mind, You don't want to pull them out. You will hurt yourself.

I saw the wires/tubes coming out and piec es of my brain wer e stuck to them and dropped off onto the floor. I just h ad to be still until it was finished. It didn't hurt,\" she added. \"I was just so mad at not being ab le t o m ove my head. I've never had a dr eam like that before. I'm s till made as hell!\" On the night of September 20, 1993, Amy e xperienced a time gap, and her record of the event in her journal is very ty pic al of suc h reports. Af ter first not ing that the phone m ade a strange \"beep\" at 11:17 p .m., s he wrote, \"I was sittin g he re at my desk in my st udy, and I not iced that I felt funny all of a s udden. I've felt th at sudde n, brief anxiety feel ing before.\" Her daughter walked in at that moment, and Am y r eacted angrily because th e c hild shoul d have been i n bed by that t ime, 12:07 a.m. \"Then I we nt ba ck to m y work,\" she wrote, \"and I felt bad that I had yelled at Grace. A few mi nutes later, I heard a noise that sounded like the door knob of the front door being t urned. I thought Grac e wa s opening the door to look for me (when I take the dog out). I ju mped up and look ed ou t the little wi ndow on the front d oor, but G race was not outside. \"I turned on the light, but no one was on the p orch.

But other times she had flashback m emories pop up suddenly, inc luding one scene in which she woke up one night hearing the w ords, Did yo u think it was all by accident? The statement's meani ng was clear, she said, \"that the Earth is a giant zoo or experiment.\" 118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Other such \"downloadings\" of ideas and sc enes i ncluded one of a \"future world\" our children will \"i nheri t,\" a world that i s \"dyi ng.\" On one occasion, t he thought, We were without form played through her head repeatedly.

She also recalled a lesson which showed how the a liens use \"frightening images\" through 'mental proj ec tions\" to con trol hum an s. \"Fea r is th e re al enemy,\" she said. In April 1993, Amy had her fi rst taste of a phenom enon a ll t oo familia r to abductees : the black h elicopters. After the first one fl ew over her home she n oted, \"They really do exist-now I know w hat one looks like.\" O ther such flights have occurred since then, frequently late at night w ith repeated ci rcular passes above her home. And like so many other abductees, A my has r eason to believe her children have been touched by the phenomenon. One daughter recently said her leg was tingling \"the w ay it feel s when you put i t through the wall,\" indicating to Amy that the child m ight w ell have been recei ving the same sort of i nstruction she herself had. Her other daughter des cribed t wo t ypes of \"balls of light \" she has seen r epea tedly in th e hou se. On i s large r than a basketball and mult icolored, and the ot her type is s maller, d isplaying a trail or tail of so me so rt. Amy was very concerned about further evidence o f her children's invo lvement after what she thought was a dream turned out to be highly questionable. In t he first part, she was ab oard a sh ip wi th se ve ral smaller Grays and two or three six-foot-tall entities. The Grays told her that hum an concept s of \"Armageddon\" were not correct. \" I remember thinking that w hat they told m e w as nothing like anything I, or anyone, ha d ever imagined,\" she said. And w hile th is occurred, A my sa id she cou ld feel the taller beings \"directing\" t he lect ure and that their mind was in her m ind, an intens ely f elt pres ence t hat m ade her \"want to cry.\" It w as similar to the intensity of the \"lad y\" w ho taught her things, she said. \"No matter how tough I cons ider m yself to be, I w ouldn 't stand a c han ce against the Tall Ones,\" she emphasized. \"I think they reminded me that they have me, body and soul, and always hav e had m e.\" In the next part of the dr eam, she and her daughter Grace were involved in a series of scenes and events cul minati ng with a police car approaching them. A my said it had very bright lights that were \" not right for a police car.\" The policeman inside, w hom she didn't l ike, spoke to her, but then sh e awok e from the dr eam when her other daughter began coughing. She later went back to bed, hearing a \" lou d st atic-buzz sound \" before falli ng asl eep. The next morning while cooking, Amy sai d her ear began to i tch. \"I rubbed my finger i n my ear and felt something inside and outside of my ear. I looked at my f inger , and t her e was some dried blood on it. I w ent to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. I could see dried blood in my ear and down my cheek.\" Fright ened that this had s omething to do with t he s trange dream, she carefully 119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"quest ioned her daughters to see if their night had been disturbed. G race said she'd had a weird dream, and Am y began to tell her about the dream she had. W hen she reached the part about the co lored lights on the police car, Grace finish ed the sentence for her, descri bing them as \"like a rain bow.\" Amy asked her how she r emembered seeing t hem, but Gr ace couldn't explai n. Amy' s me mo ries an d t he children's various remarks indicate alien contact w ith the entire family, although A my i s more convi nced by the \"hard ev idenc e\" and c ons cious experiences she has witnessed. Grace's recent spate of nosebleeds, for e xample, are a w orrisome indication of possible implant acti vity, and A my has further been mysti fied by certain unexplained scars on her body, including the circular scar on her shoulder and a one-inch linear scar down the middle of her nos e that appear ed in l ate 1993. This sort of evidence-as well as her c onscious daytime UFO sighting in January 1994, of four obj ec ts merging into one- are all unwelc ome because they m ake it difficult for Amy to reject the phenom enon's reality. She kno ws t hat it is m ore than a quest ion of random abduct ions, from the information she has been s hown, and she is concerned about the direction and nat ure of events indicated by the inform ation. In November 1993 she recorded a vivid dream in w hich she was with other people in a large room. \"We were told that we were selected to experience the end of the world,\" she wrote. \"God was this ball of lig ht that loo ked like a little sun. God was tellin g us that what we ex perienced w as fo r all ...th at we shoul d feel honor ed and lucky to exper ience the end of the w orld.\" It was explained that Amy and the other humans were really \"spirit beings\" seeking chall engi ng exper iences. \"O ur true natur e is to seek ever y opportu nity to grow and to lear n. Ev en s adn es s, sorrow , pain, and mi sery represent opportunities to experience and learn. I unde rstood that the meani ng of life was just to experience, that's all-experience.\" This message resonates with another c ommunication Amy has had from her unseen guides, telli ng her that humans are \"a species wi thin a species\" and that our bodies are mere \"contain ers\" for the spi ritual en tities w e trul y are. Another pi ece of informati on came in a con sci ou s flash o r v ision, in w hich it w as explained that a parti cular person would be coming to public noti ce cl aiming to be Christ. Am y said she was sh own how all t he religious p eop le around t he world wou ld per ceive this per son as the inc arnat ion of what ever deity they worshiped, and t hat he would be accepted as god on eart h. This would caus e m any people to turn agai nst those w ho didn't accept the new figure, leadi ng to the persecuti on and suppression of what is actually true. In effec t, she explained, the false leader and his false religious teaching w ould win out over s piritual truth. A startling encounter in January 1994 had caused Amy to wonder even more about her lifelong involvem ent wit h t he \"Counci l.\" She hear d ab out a very stra nge gr oup of people, who c alled themselves the \"Total Ov ercomers\" or the \"Om ega\" group, hol ding 120"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"meeti ngs in the Dall as ar ea.

Now they were traveling through the country to \"harvest\" t he people who had been \"i mplanted\" with the p roper knowledge and who w ere ready to make the transition to the next stage of \"more than human.\" This requir ed br eak ing all hum an t ies of lov e, fa mily and fri endshi p-bonds that keep us tied to the material w orld-as w ell as living in celibacy and surrendering all dec isions to the \"elders.\" T hey a lso said that ev eryone but their group had been warped a nd programm ed negativ ely, eit her by society 's fa lse values o r, in cases of a lien con tact, b y \"Luciferian\" aliens-whic h inc luded all gr oups except t he one that had originally instruct ed the \"elders .\" Amy described the four \"Overcomers\" whom she met as tall , thi n, pal e, as exual in dr ess (bl ack clothi ng) and hai r style, \"clone-l ike\" in appearance, and rigidl y c ontrol led emotionall y. In fact, she said that she could not feel any \"souls\" in these four people. Their message was equally ri gid: followers must go with the \"Overcomers\" immediately, w ithout a w ord to their fam ilies, with no belongin gs, and without any c lue as to where t hey will go next. These cultish demands were weird enough to A my, but the truly disturbing aspect of the \"Overcom ers,\" she said , was the details an d phr asing of their t enets giv en by the \"elders,\" for they echoed ex actl y the thi ngs tha t Amy has bee n taugh t b y her \"Counc il.\" And the pr oducts of thos e te achings-in this cul t, at l east-fel t ex tremel y w rong. \"After all I've been learning about i mplants and m ind- control,\" she t old m e, \"I m ust as k who the Council really is.

The fir st intense period of deali ng with alien a ctivity lasted from late 1987 through most of 1990, but after that the enc ounters dramatically waned in our daily life. W e breathed a figurative sigh of reli ef, hopi ng that the aliens had moved on to another task. Beside s, having become acti ve in abducti on research, this rela tively peac eful period allowed us to focus on learning from other people's experienc es, ex pa nd ing our base of knowl edge from the personal level to that of general society. I still kept a calendar notation of any questionable or unusual events, but t he frequency was so low that a journal wasn't needed any longer . In all of 1990, for i nstance, I recorded signs of only eight possible ev ents, only three of which wer e evinced in a c onscious or objective manner. In addi tion to some unexplained body marks, I wi tnessed another UFO sighti ng on February. Leavi ng a friend's at 8: 15 p.m. I saw a huge, whi te object flying rapidly at a very low altitude above three tall towers in the city. Driving on, however, I l ost track of it, but when I reached my own n eighborhood I saw it again. I decided to go to the hill near our house and have one more l ook. When I parked and walked to a prominence to get a wide view, I i mmediately saw the s ame light coming from the west toward the south. It was m oving m uch m ore slowly no w, an d bo bb ing along rhythmical ly instead of in a smooth, stra ight path. It pass ed be tween the downtown skyline and me, so I knew it coul dn't be more t han a mi le away. It began to grow larger, as if moving closer, and I felt ready to confront i t, at last, in full consciou sness. But after a bit, the light rec eded, still bobbing, and co ntinue d on into the sout h. I ran down the hill to t he car, th inking I' d dr ive h ome f or Casey and br ing him b ack to see the object. Then I thought I should have one last look to deter mine where I w ould likely find it visible when we retu rned. So I race d back up the hill and looked around. The light was not where I had previ ously seen it. I turned back in disappointment, and then caught s ight of it again, in the very position it had started from the first time. The bobbing light silently repeated its path, once again comi ng cl ose for a time and then back ing away. I returned quick ly to t he car then and drove the hal f-block distance to my ho me . The stree ts were de serted as I pul led into the gar age.

But I did see a UFO, up on the hill.\" We dr ove together back t o the prom inenc e and w ere disappointed to see nothing but the usual air traffic in the sky. At no time during 1990 did eit her of us have a c onscious encounter, just signs that something might have been going on. Emotionally and intellectually, w e had nothing concrete with which to deal . In 1991, however, at least in t he beginning, that was not the c ase. Both Cas ey and I felt a great, undi rected stress, as we'd do ne back in 1988, and that e xperience told us tha t ac tivi ty migh t be recurring wh ich wa s kept repr essed from our c onsc ious ness. In January, our son's friend James reported e ncounters with unusual entities, one of wh ich once maske d itself with the illu sio n of a beautiful blonde woma n before reveal ing a very di fferent physi ology. C asey also recalled a possible encou nter with the blond group that month, which ha d seemed like a VRS dream ev ent (as rec ounted in INTO THE FRI NGE). For Casey, the event wa s dist urbing and puz zling, a nd we bot h wondered if anything further could occur. But nothi ng similar happened, nothing b ut a few unexplained mar ks, unt il Apr il. Shortly before leaving for the O zark U FO Conference early t hat month, we had a \"phantom sedan\" incident, remi niscent of \"Men in Black\" reports. In this event, a very real-looking black car r olled down the street, c ame to a near st op as i t reache d our yard boundary, and a human- look ing man in a w hite shirt and dark suit, wearing sunglass es, peer ed through the car 's deeply tinted wi ndows into the front of our hous e-where I was standi ng st aring back out. I turned ar ound to shout f or Casey to come see it, and when I look ed back the car had vani shed. In June, the mysterious helic opters returned, appearing on three different days. By the end of t he month we made a permanent move to Arkans as, and t hereaft er, in a n area with heavy, normal helicopter t raffic, it was impossible to tell if any of it wa s unusual . We found a few questi onable marks on our bodies in Au gu st, but it wa sn't unt il October that a memory of an ything speci fic turned up. During t he ni gh t o f th e fou rtee nth, I p hysically go t out of bed at so me point, and I als o had a dream that aliens were about to come into a long, narrow room w here I was waiting. My only thought was, Don't s care me!

One other incident, i n January 1992, involved a nother almost-conscious realization that an intrusion was occurring. I woke at 1:34 a.m., opened m y eyes, and wondered why the room was so foggy. My i mmediate rationalization was that my eyes just h adn't yet focused, and I got out of bed to go to t he bathr oom. When I sta rted walk ing, a s udden rus h of thick, clear liquid wit h tiny black specks suspended in it flooded from me, much more than can be produced naturally by the body, but I had no idea w here it had come from. Neither could I account for the new scratch and bruise I found the next day. These things wer e physically r eal, yet something w ithin me didn't really \"come to grips\" wit h what might be happening to us. I wouldn't let these ev ents obsess m e or throw m e off track from researching other people's si tuations. If the aliens wanted to get my attention again, they were going to hav e to do a l ot better than this, I de cided. A stra nge sn ippet of a d ream now and then, a few m arks, even t he l iquid-the significance of which I certainly knew from o ther women's accounts- weren't en ough to frighten m e or mov e me in an y se rious way. I refuse d to feel under attack, even granting t hat some activi ty was occurring. But I was only able to keep this f ram e of mind because I wasn 't perceiving them consci ously. For m onths thereaft er, neit her Casey no r I no ticed a nything ine xplicab le or suspic ious. Throughout most of 1992 I was busy with radio and newspaper interviews, the result of INTO THE FRINGE being released, and I also worked on a research project i nvolving Ted Rice, the w ell-known p sychic in Shreveport, Louisiana, whose lifelong experiences with alien forces shed extraordinary light on some of t he abduction activities which have been so hard to penetrate. The per iod of no unusual act ivity, howev er, ca me to an end wi th a bang on the morni ng of October 13. I was sitting at the coffee tabl e worki ng on Ted's material, when a large ball of white light appeared and exploded right in front of me, less than four feet away. There was no nois e, so I realiz ed I hadn't merely seen a reflective flash from an explosion. Five m inutes later, a no ise d id o ccur, a v ery loud, pounding noise that slammed against the kitchen wall w ith a house-shaking thump. My dogs started up, b arking, and w e ran to the kitchen doo r to see w hat had happened. The garage doors were closed and l ocked, however, with nothing out of t he ordinary in sight. My immedi ate r espons e was a feeling tha t this was an announcement of some sort, a declaration of a r enewed presence. An d from past experi ence I could rec ogniz e the \"feel\" of this in trus ion. Ther e wa s no fear or anger in m y mind, just a complete d etermination to fa ce wha teve r would come next. That proved to be a UFO sighti ng. On October 27, at 7 p.m., our neighbors phoned to say they'd been w atching a UFO for the past ten minutes an d w anted us to com e out f or a look. I had dinner cook ing just then, but C asey and a visiting friend raced up the r oad, in time to watch an o dd orange -red orb o f light disappearing behind the tr ee line. The neighbor s said th ey saw the orb change col ors f rom white to o range, and t hat at on e po int a solid-look ing beam of light emerged and moved around before retracting back into the UFO as it moved away.

U FO sightings 124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"are surprisi ngly frequent in central Arkansas, and they are often seen by m ultiple witnesses. This sighting, although mom entarily exciting, was oddly unaffecting. If this sighting report had come from someone else, I would have recognized the pacified r esponse, but it's much harder to anal yze onesel f than s omeone else. The next month, as I start ed a dusk stroll up the drive, I had my most bizarre UFO sighting to date. And again I experienc ed a sedated reaction. In a bsolute silence, a large, rectangular craft soared ov er m y mot her- in-law' s cottage, whic h is t hirty fe et fr om our ho use, just ab ove tree top level. M y first respo nse was exhilaration, and I started t o run up the drive to foll ow it. But i ts speed, w hile not startl ing, w as fast enough that the craft was soon out of sight, blocked b y the tall, thick trees on our property. I observed i t long enough to get a cl ear pi cture, though. It reminded m e of a t rain boxcar in lengt h and width, alth ough not q uite as tall, and i t loo ked m etallic-brown. The bottom of the cr aft had an in dentation or bar across the mi ddle, wi th a large amber light a t e ach e nd. F our m ore a mber lights marked each corner of the rectangular object, for a total of six lights. Within a m atter of seco nd s, m y ex hilaration dis appeared along wit h the craft, and instead of racing inside to get Casey, I just began to stroll again. Whe n I did go back in , I told hi m o f the si ghting and t hat I hadn' t had t ime to not ify hi m bef ore the c raft flew o ff. My natural excitement and cur iosit y felt arti ficially suppressed, so much so that I didn't even make a notation of the sighting on my ca lendar. In fact, it simply faded from m y memory for almost two weeks before I suddenly remembered it again. After exper ienc ing this response several times, I am now conv inc ed that it is externally im pos ed and thus denotes outside contact of a very real nature. At the time, however, I w as unconcerned. M y friend Brenda was in the midst of much more ov ert alien intrusions in her home, and they seemed more i mportant than the few things we'd experienced o urselves. Besides, as I'd deci ded earl ier, i t woul d t ake something highly significant to pique my interest and get m e to interact on a personal level with the aliens again. On January 8, 1993, it got rath er personal when I w oke up to find m y clothing ha d be en removed, and I hadn't been t he one who re moved them. This w as always upsetting to me when it occurred in the pas t, f or it made me f eel int imat ely and help lessly v iolated. I had the same response this time, and when I phoned Brenda to dis cuss it the next morning, she told me of the dream she'd had the same night. I was in i t. She d reamed she was aboard a cra ft, immobile on a table, and she could see m e on a table beside her, als o unable to move. S he s aid s he tr ied desperat ely to r each out to me, but couldn't, and that's all she r ecalled. I had no memory to match the event, but the missing clothing was indica tive of so me n octu rnal activity I hadn 't generated. It was C asey's turn ne xt, in Febr uar y. O n the morning of the seventeenth he told me that in the middle of the nigh t, at 12:38 a.m., a loud \"bang\" noi se awak ened him from a dream. (Normally I am the one who awakens at any sound, while he sleeps through everythi ng.) In the dream, he had been stand ing in the living room looking out the picture w indow at the ridge behind our property. A large, w hite orb appeared in the 125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"sky and t hen descended to the ridg e. H e told m e that he instantly remembered the dream when he w as aw akened by the bang and that he t hen g ot ou t of bed a nd wa lked into the living room. Just a s in the dream, he st ood peer ing ou t th e win dow , w atching in f ull c ons cious nes s as a lar ge, whit e orb appeared and descende d to the ridge. \"What happened then?\" I a sked, and he shrugged. \"I guess I went back to bed,\" he said, \"but I honest ly don't remember doing it.\" And his response was curiously pass ive, as m ine had been. This tim e I not iced a nd det ermined to be more alert if anything el se were to occur, to fi ght the passi ve effect in order t o react the way I thought best, rath er than the w ay s ome outside force directed me. In April I also had a nighttime event, much less dramatic than C asey's sighting of the orb, but nonetheles s inexplic able. At 1:14 a.m. I awoke hearing t he sound of a C-130 airplan e, with which I'm very familiar as trai ning flights from t he ne arby military b ase have regular paths over thi s area. The plane s ounded as i f it was ju st comi ng directl y overhead, a t an extremely low alti tude. My fi rst rea ction was i rritation at the thoughtles sness of tr aining f lights at s uch an intrusive hour. I'll phone the bas e in the m orning and c omplain, I thought as I lay there with Cas ey s oundl y asleep beside me. But seconds, and then m inutes, elapsed, and the noise of the C-130 didn 't w aver, increase, or di minish. It can't be hov ering! I thought , but th at's e xact ly how it sounded-as if a C-130 was motionless low over the hous e. In a normal st ate of consciousness-w hich I re ally tho ugh t I had -I w ould have awake ned Casey to hea r it, too, but I didn't. Instead , six or seven minutes a fter first hea ring it, I ju st fell asleep. It didn't occur to m e to resist. For ov er a year I had k ept the att itude t hat I wouldn't acknowledge alien contact back in my life, in our lives, without strong, overt experie nces. I ha d a lso been pr aying, in m y fashion, to whatever good and loving and true higher forces may be out there, a sking for two t hings: t hat t hey guide me to know and foll ow the power of goodness; and that they communicate with me i n an ov ert m anner, wit hout an y subt lety or am biguit y. I pray ed for help, for i nformation that would be clear enough for a child to u nderstand, as I realized my level of understanding and perception were about that rudi mentary in dealing with the aliens. I wanted a c omm unic ation that coul dn' t be dismisse d, va riously interpreted, or ambiguous as t o its nat ure. On Ma y 1 0, 1 993 , I ma y have gotten a partial a nswer to that prayer, although great caution is called for in assessin g any contacts before accepting them at face v alue. Th is particular contact conformed exactly to other abductees' descripti ons of the VRS dream and was the first of its kind I had exper ienced to suc h a degree. I was in t he m iddle of a nor mal dr ea m when suddenl y I was some how remo ved fro m that dream and found my self si tting in a chair, in a dark ened a rea, accompanied by entities I wasn't allow ed to see. They spok e to me, clearly and freq uently, througho ut the event. I w as facing a small stage area, which I now f eel was more holographic than solidly three-dimensional even though at the ti me it looked quite r ealistic. My \"hosts\" told me I w as to watch a scena rio played out on the stage. 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"It b egan w ith a s cen e fro m Ge nesi s, in w hich Esau returned h ome feel ing so hun gry he feared he would die. His y ounger brother Jacob w as si tting there eating a bowl of pottage, and Esau begged him to share it. Jacob said he would give Esau the food, but only in exc hange for Esau's birthright as th e oldest son of Isaac. I heard Esau say, It won't do me any good to have the birthright if I die of starvation, so I'll agree to trade it for the food. Then the scenario on stag e changed to anothe r part of the br othe rs' story. In this second scene, Isaac was very old and blind and knew that he was close to death. He called for Esau to be brought to hi m to r eceive the laying-on of hands that would confer the inhe ritan ce. Jac ob w rap ped an ani mal skin around hi s arm and presented it for his father 's touch. Isaac felt the fur and believed it was the arm of his v ery hairy e ldest son. So in his ignorance of this de ception he conf erred t he blessing and gave Jacob t hat which rightfully belonged to Esau. The play ended, and then it star ted right up ag ain, play ing ou t s everal mo re t imes as my hosts discussed its meaning with me. At vari ous points they would stop the action, much as we pause a video tape, and w ould point out some specific detail and tell me what it meant, what it symbolized, and what the message w as trying to convey. They told me no t to foc us on the bi blical aspect of t he play, that their message had nothing to do with any actual Jacob and Es au, but that the story w as d esigned to illustr ate important informat ion about w hat the aliens are doing to humans, both in the past and in the present. The hosts went through the play with m e several times, pointing out details and saying t hings like, Okay? Let's try it again. Now watch clos ely. And t he play would proceed. Aft er several r epet itions, I suddenly \"woke up\" in my bed, amazed by what I'd just seen. I got out of bed for a w hile, trying to discern the nature of the event, w hether dream-like or externally generated, and I also pondered on the meaning of the scenario. When I l ay back down, as soon as I touched the pillow I was suddenly back in t he chair , facing t he stage, and my hosts said w e w ould now resume. O nce again the play began running, as d id the e xplication o ffered b y my abductors. And when they apparently were sat isfied, t he act ion c eas ed and the abductors gave me a c lear ly de lineat ed summa ry of the things I was m eant to perceive. Esau, the older and hai rier brot her, they explained, represents the original human species on this planet. Jacob represents the al tered product of alien genetic m anipulations of that older species. The aliens produc ed this new v ariant and then used it to replac e t he original form. In our c urrent s ituat ion, the a liens ar e onc e aga in doing genet ic alterations of our spec ies and are onc e again trying to produce a var iant which will be more useful fo r their purposes and which will supplant us . A nd agai n i t w ill be at tempted through decepti on, as Jacob deceived Isaac. This deception, I was told, is being carried out by the aliens through exploitati on and m anipulation of global events, including w eather phenomenon, to make us believ e that the planet is in imminent danger of cat aclysm and destruction. This is why they impress the idea of co ming destr uct ion upon s o many abductees, telli ng then they will have tasks to perform at that ti me.

What have we got t o los e if we ac cept alien he lp, even t hough t hat m eans acc epting alien c ont rol?

Thes e terrible disasters we s ee-the flooding, hurricanes , and eart hquakes-are sometimes b eing intensified by the very aliens who will t hen come in and offer to save us from \"inevitable\" de structi on. We should not believe them, I was told emphatically. A nd we must not surrender our s overeignty to them, as that w ould mean we were t ruly lost forever. After this, I knew nothing m ore until w aking in the morning, very disturbed by wha t I'd been shown. I had no w ay of i denti fying the sour ce of thi s event and never caug ht ev en a glimpse of my abductors, who stayed b ehind m e in the d ark. I c ouldn't d educe anything about the event from my past encounters, because th is one w as completely different. I knew I hadn't been taken any wher e, becaus e I woke up c onsciously in the midst of the experience and was a ble t o check my physical surroundin gs. And there was no doubt i n my mi nd that during the encounter I was not asleep; in fact, I remember being s o awake when I w as remove d to the chair that I thought, How can they snatch m e right out of a dream like that? The experience seemed designed in some ways to fulfill the request I'd made for a straightforward, clearly comprehensi ble commun ication that would be helpful. T hey must hav e taken me at m y liter al word, f or the message was reinforced in ev ery conc eivable way: visually, repetitiously, and verbally. So did that mean I could acc ept it as coming from a benevolent source? Could I test or trust its accu racy? All I could do, finally , was hold the mess age in r eserve and compare it to the events that occur as time passes. At least parts of w hat they told m e I already knew to be true. The aliens do make a p ractice of giving abductees information about a coming time o f destruction o r chan ge . W ith th e m any na tural disasters of recent time, it is an easy message to beli eve.

But even these two \"facts\" I still had to qu estion, be caus e in neither case could we objec tively verify th e activities . Things around our home went back to normal a fter that, until the middle of July, when a series of odd noises start ed to plague us. We hear d everything f rom large plastic ware (nonexistent, of c our se) shattering on our wood floors, to gigantic i nvisible woodpeckers hammering aw ay in the li ving room. Things got even stranger one evening in August, when Casey and I had a parallel and infuriating e xperience. I heard him ask me a question, and when I turned around to answer him, instead he answered it himself.

The s tress was af fecting m e, t oo, lead ing t o recurrent insomni a and sl eep disruptions. I started doing something I've never done in the past-leaving m y bed, and Casey, to try to rest elsewhere.

I had a dream earlier this month. It woke me up, and I lo oked at the clock. It was ar ound 4 a. m.

A nd I noticed then, and only then, that my heart was st ill pounding faster than us ual. \"I thought there must hav e been somet hing to that dream, so I tried to remember m ore.

She' s not responsible 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"for what ever might have happ ened. If any thing r eally did.\" That was the question we were always left to face, the nature of an event's reality. In some reports, two people have separately recalled being in an identical d ream or sit uat ion, and in thos e cases the peopl e i nvolved can feel more certain of the dr eam or event's ob jectiv e real ity. But i t doesn' t always happ en tha t way. Som etimes one person will h ave a trau mat ic ex per ience i nvol ving another person, an d the real ity of the event is so convi ncing that the experi encer beli eves the o ther person w as truly in volved, no matter how impossible ti m e and locat ion considerati ons may seem. Grante d, ther e is plenty of ev idenc e f or the a lien s' ability to manipulat e time and space, s o the objective reality of such events cannot automatically be d ismissed. But there is also hard evidence that the aliens are m asters of illusion, total-sensory, gut-and-heart- wr enching illusion, gener ated by an ex ternal mech anism. An d when an abduc tee is in an altered state, t he illus ion is ver y convinci ng to his cont rolled p ercep tion s. This lesson had been brought home by the ex traordinary V RS involving A melia that Ted and M arie witnessed in 1 991, and now I was seeing, po ssibly, with m y husband's bewildered emotions, just how masterful the aliens' dec eptive mechanisms c an be. For Ameli a, the event had been a virtual -reality solo flight, the external product or result of the blue sphere technology and its cr eat ors. Knowing this, I wo nd ered if Ca sey' s dreams were objective or v irtual experiences, the product of som e sim ilar t echnology, and so did he. The only thing he knew to be \"real\" was the n ameless woman he c ame face to face with in the mall. This experience, all of our ex periences and those of t he eight women recoun ted here, define the abduction phenomenon. It is complex, ambi guous, deceptive, i nconsistent, traumatic, physical, and metaphysical, w ith no s ingle o r c lear p urpose. T here a re patterns and poss ibilities, but none so plainly v erifiable that everyone can agree on the facts, much less t he larg er truth, of t he agenda. If all that C asey and I knew about alien abducti ons was lim ited t o our own exp eriences, we woul d have a ver y diff erent pict ure of the situat ion. And we would b e much more vul nerabl e to al ien mani pulat ions or programming in our ignorance. It is only wh en we consider our experiences within the larger context of Amy's experiences, and Beth's and Lisa's and the experiences of th e th ou san ds of othe r abd uctee s, th at we gain enough knowledge to get past the personal illusions. And it is only by giving up our wishful ideas and faci ng the data squarely that any of us can hope to penetrate to the actuality of these events, to come to ter ms wi th \"wha t is \" ra ther tha n wha t we wish it to be. 132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Comparative Chart of Experiences 133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"XI -- Expanding the Vie w A c omparison of the dat a f rom thes e s epar ate reports emphatically proves one point. Our current concept of the ab duction experience i s too smal l, too lim ited, and f ar too simplified. The Comparative Chart lists 114 elements from the reports, including d etails which wer e omitted in previous chapters b ecause of space considerations. When the data is categorized and c orrelated, some surprising c onsistencies emerge that force the current view to expand, in both quant ity an d quality. Before beginning the comparison, however, it should be not ed again that four of the women under went s ome r egr essive hypnos is: Beth, Jane, Angi e, and A my, wi th three different hypnotists. Out of the 114 listed details on the Chart, Beth reported 87, J ane reported 77, Amy 73, and Angie had 96. The o ther four women showed consistently fewer reported details, although not significantly so. Polly had 67 of the 114 detail s in her ac count, Pat ha d 7 1, Lis a had 94, and Anit a r eported 53. Almost a ll of the de tails, from each of the eight women, came from pre- hypnotic recollections. In the \"Contacts\" category there are eight di fferent s ituations reported, and seven of these eight have been reported by all of the women. These include 240 UFO sigh ting s; m issing time a s a c hild; m issing time as an adult; consciousness of an encounter; virtual -reality event s; telepat hic communications ; an d the exte ns ion of alie n involvement into lives of other family members. T hree of them experien ced miss ing time or abduct ions with ot her people. The data i ndicates, then, that the phenomenon is not imaginary or self-generated, that it is linked to the UFO sightings, that it involves a generational interest on th e pa rt of the aliens, and t hat c ontac t can be m ade by rem ote m eans. The \"Aliens\" category contains a surpri sing vari ety of physi cal types reported, including s ome that are rarely ment ioned elsewhere. While all eig ht w omen encounter ed the Gray aliens , the Whites (insectoid) and the hooded fi gures are almost as comm on, t urning up in s even ac count s. Blond humanoid figures have been seen by six of the women, as have the cat-eyed or reptoid type. H alf of the women reported a wrinkle-fac ed entity similar to a ta ll Gra y or Wh ite, as we ll as a short er, oft en hairy creat ure v arious ly refer red to as a \"troll\" or \"dwarf.\" A nd bo th a blue entity and a \"Jesus\" fi gure have been witnessed by thr ee of the women. In addition to not ing t he var iety of physic al ty pes, i t is important to realize that every combi nati on of these different entities have been reported w orking t ogether in abduction scena rios. It is ha rd t o concl ude , then, that the v arious t ypes a re really s eparat e gr oups carrying out separ ate f unct ions or m issions. Abductees typically report under going some sort of physical examination at one time or another, as researchers have long acknowledged. A comparison of the details reported in the \"Exam\" categ ory show t hat two areas of the human body are most commonly inv olved: the reproductiv e sy stem and the brain. Only five of the w omen remember gy nec ologic al procedures, how ever , and only three of them re port possi ble i mplanted or missing fetuses, so the aliens' interest in reproduction or genetics may not be their sol e pur pos e. While this group c omprises all wom en, they are not the only sex reporti ng fetal 141"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"impl antations or extr actions, as bizarr e as this seems . In one m an's accou nt, he recalled an abdomi nal inci sion into whi ch a malleabl e sac of tiny fetuses w as placed a nd lat er surgically retrieved. Another man said that a similar f etal container was inserted rectally. More o f t he w omen r eport i mplant p rocedures and \"head operations\" than gynecological activity. Anita is the only one who does not recall receiving an i mplant, and five women report some surgical activ ity on their skulls or brai ns. This acti vity has no apparent connection to a cro ssbreeding agenda and poi nts to a pro gram o f greate r complexity than the lim ited \"genet ics\" theor y. A variety of alien instruments are repor ted in t hese procedures, but the most common here are the w and-type device, found in four accounts, and the s mall metal box, usually black, which is reported by th ree wome n. There are four accounts of a \"lady doctor\" pr esent duri ng examinati ons, and three of the women saw oper ations perf orm ed on other ab ductees dur ing their e xperiences. Three also were made to ea t or drink somet hing wh ile in ali en custody. The most common detail of the examination s cenario, however, is the report of an alien's face very close t o the abduct ee 's f ace, whic h has been exper ienc ed by all of the wom en but Pat. Whether t his is a type of exam inat ion or an exertion of mental control over the abductee isn't clear, and of cour se it could be both. There is evidence that the l arge, black, glassy ey es so familiar from Gray report s m ay not be b iological eyes but instead may be coverings that perform technol ogicall y, abl e to cal m the abductee, do a scan of s ome sort, and ev en, as Pat felt , \"film\" or record data from our minds. Other activities besides the exams occur in abduction encounters. All of the women repor t tha t the aliens comm unic ated wit h t hem at some point , although not dur ing every encounter. A nd seven of t hem recall teaching or testing s essions. During abductions, six report expe riencing levi tation, fi ve r ecall passing through solid objects, and four witnessed or performed telekinesis. On the ' hardware' side of things, four w omen w ere shown how to operat e s ome of the equipm ent aboard a craft, and on t he 's oftware' side t hree of th em were induc ed to reli ve or envisi on a past ti me or event in their lives. Again, these activiti es point to an agenda mor e complex than crossbreedi ng. Six of t he wom en do, howev er, repo rt sc enes generally known as \"baby presentations\" in w hich apparently hybr id infa nts ar e s hown t o abduct ees and a re said to be created from some human-alien crossbreeding process. But half of the women also report being forced or indu ced to engage in (mostly t raumatic) sexual activities with aliens, humanoids, or other ab ductees. A nd all these acti vities have little to d o with cross breeding or gat hering of r eproduct ive m aterial. Some researchers have theorized that all such sexual scenarios are the product of mind control-erotic images w ithout substance-used m erely to facilitate an actual event which involves nothing mo re than the taking of sp erm or ova. But there are problems with thi s theory. For one th ing, although s perm-gathering c an b e accomplished via erotically induced o rgasm o n the p art o f a m ale, it c ertainly isn't 142"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"necessary for ova-gathering. In fact, it is totally unnecessary. Nor does it serve a reproducti ve purpose for her to be compelled to m asturbate, as in some abductions, as well as in cases where the person feels \"switched on\" for this purpose when no abduction is underway. Another problem is that s exual intrusions involving reproductively immat ure chi ldren are reported. And finally, there is clearly no s perm/ova gat her ing going on in thos e sit uat ions wher e abduct ees ar e forced int o sexual sit uat ions t ogether. Abductees report a wide yet c onsistent pattern of c ommunications from the aliens, bot h in t heir presence and through re mote contact. The most c ommon communications focus on the origin of the h uman species, the \"spec ial\" nature of the alien-abductee relations hip and of the abductee pers onally w ho has an important function to p erform, the di stinction of body and spi rit, and warn ings of future g lobal destruction, which were all reported by a majority of the w omen. These are not trivial subj ects. It woul d be as danger ous to ignore this information as it woul d be to believe everything the aliens say. In the \"Settings\" category ther e is a similar consistency of reports, incl uding the highly controversial scenar io of the undergroun d base, present i n ha lf of the cases. Even mo re surprisin g, perh aps, is that se ven of the women saw other a pparently human peopl e i n thei r en counters, working with the aliens aboard craft as well as in the terrestrial facilities. And in six cases, th e humans were p erceived as military personnel. Many researchers have, unfortunately, been u nwilling to take report s of human-alien collusion seriou sly. One rese arche r tol d me that h e b elieved every case of human col lusion coul d be expl ained as illu sions perpetrated by an exclusively alie n group. B ut all it takes to dispel t his view is one c onf irmed case of m ilitary or human involvement, and from information that has been shared w ith m e in confidence, I am satisfied that at least one such c ase exi sts, that of Leah Haley, whose ordeal of military i ntrusions and threats is to ld in LOST WAS T HE KEY. Another researc her has c laimed repeatedly that n one of his many investigations has produced reports or evidenc e of human mili tary involv ement . His c laim, however, has been disputed by some of the abductees with w hom he ha s worked, who say they have indeed reported these ev ents only to ha ve them discounted by the investi gator. Yet the reports overwhelmingl y point to actual human involvement with alien abductions. Det ails of reports ar e cons istent throughout the country, and the only t hing that diff ers , finally, is the in terpretation o f those details by the researchers. Reports of human military involvement m ust be addressed w ith m ore than an unexami ned dismi ssal , for they are as common as the baby presentat ion scenarios that are a ccepted at face value by the traditi onal view. W hether \"real\" or contrived, these events serve a pur pos e that the r esearch ers need to disc over. Six other accounts described the abductees either viewing or being in a desert setting or on a desert-type planet, although the ex planation of this scene vari es from one report to another. Wi thin the al ien facilities, five women saw telev ision-type screens, f our saw instrument panels , and f our were s hown graphs or charts. A nd al though i t isn't noted on the C hart, three women described unusual black, flexible tubing in the facilities, both aboard the craft and in 143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"underground locations. Other reported details in alien settings included b odies o f water or liquid, in three ca ses, as well as three repor ts o f ani mal s pr esent. Of m ore conce rn are the thre e ac counts of ab duc tees seeing, or being told of, cloned human bodi es. Both Lisa an d Pat w ere shown clones of their bodies, although they were given different expl anations. Simil ar reports come f rom other abductees, and in one ca se a ma n said he saw a room full of inert male and female human bodies, who were beaut iful and ident ical. The implications o f s uch r eports a re enormous, considering the po ssible uses the aliens cou ld ma ke of these carbon-copy human bodies. The eight wom en reported a number of physica l effects, consistent with general abduction data, but the only two effects which were universal were patterns of unexpl ained bruises and particular noises in the ear or head. Whi le t he noi ses could be rati onal ized, p erha ps, the bruise s cle arly indi cate s ome physical interaction. The repetition of triangular m arks in abductee reports may well indi cate a single s ource for all of the marks. Other signs of physical, rather than psychic or spiritual, contact include six reports of unexplained blood on the women's bodies or be dclothes, s ix r eports of scoop marks, five wom en wit h s cratches, and seven wi th puncture wound s. The case for actual phys ical cont act is also bolstered by the six women who reported w aking up wi th thei r clothi ng on b ackward, inside out, or completely missing. The women experienced a variety of other p hysical reactions in addi tion to the i nternally heard beeps and electronic-type tones. All but Pat, for i nstance, experienced nausea during or after an encounter, and five reported su dden, total exhaust ion in whi ch all thei r energ y drained away in an instant. Five women described awaking at t imes and f eeling as if they 'd been \" beat en, \" to us e Anit a's term. And five sai d they had epi sodes in which a bli ndi ng li ght seemed to explode in their minds. Unexplained rashes turned up in fi ve of the cases, and instanc es of badly irri tated eyes and waking with an unidentified bitter taste were both r eported four times. Additionally, two of the women suffered unus ual hair los s and unac countable \" sunburns. \" The physi cal nature of the abduction scenar io extends t o o ther t hings in t he abductee's environment. T he e xternal e ffects related to the phenomenon are very consistent, as the Chart demonstrates. Every one of the w omen hav e exper ienced biz arre electronic disturbanc es, for i nstance , and phone di sturbanc es, both wi th the equipment and the callers. And seven out of eight r eported lights in the yard, lights in the house, voices, c licking sounds, as well as miscellaneous thumps, pops, whistles, bangs, an d hums in the environment, all without explanation. Outside the house, five of the w omen have witnessed t he o verflight of unaccountable, unmarke d, or unidentifiable heli copters, all appeari ng af ter the abductees became a ware of their situations. The most consistent corr elations bet we en the women show up in the \"P ersonal Res pons e/Ev ent\" category. All of them suffer from chronic or frequent sleep disrupti on, all have undergone drastic attitude s hifts, and they all fe el a st rong de sire to live in rural locations, no matter what t hei r previous backgrounds. Seven of the eight w omen report 144"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"unexplained compulsions associated with th eir experiences, such a s Polly's compul sion at ti mes to take c hildren, including other peopl e's chil dren, to a certain spot where UFOs ar e often sighted, som ething s he wou ld not do of her own c hoice. And Anita i s the only one who has not report ed f eeling they are being prepared t o carry out some unidentified task, job, or mi ssion rel ated to the ali en agenda. Three types of dreams show up in seven of the r eports, as well. The first involves the arr ival or landing or invasi on of numerous U FOs on ea rth, a dream reported so frequently with the same detail s t hat I refer to it as 'T he Night of Lights,\" from the typical description. The sec ond dream shows scenes of coming dis aster and c haos on the planet, and in some cases the abductees are led to believe that thei r upc om ing \" job s\" will be carried out at the time of destruction. The third dream type is prophetic, s howing events which c ome t o pas s after the dr eam . The final category, \"Personal Background,\" shows, i n fact, that all of the women have dem ons trated above-average psychic abilities. The data on eth nic b ackground inc luded her e ha s onl y relat ive import ance, foc using as i t does on the C eltic and Nativ e Am erican heritages whic h are mor e pr evalent i n American ab duc tion rep orts tha n any other speci fic ethni c gr oup s. The abd uction ph enom en on i s glo bal, and in any given region the ethnici ty would surely be d ifferent. What is significant, however, is the high percentage of the w omen who have had unusual or ser ious gy nec ologic al pr oblems , an i ndi ca tion t hat abduction experiences may be hazardous to their h ealth. T h e t w o r e m a i n i n g a s p e c t s o f p e r s o n a l background, childhood ab use and a family member in the intelligence community, deserve special noti ce. Some r esearc hers and mental health professionals, u nable to accept t he reality of this phenomenon, ha ve offered screened memo ries of chil d abuse as an ex planation for abdu ction me mo rie s. But as in the cas e of obj ect ions to militar y involveme nt, a ll it ta kes is one ab du cte e wh o suffer ed no abus e t o explode the t heory. Among these eight wo men , onl y th ree reported c hildhood abus e of any kind, and their memories of these events w ere not repress ed. Other theorists beli eve that abduction activi ty is per petrated by humans rather than aliens , car rying out massive mind-contro l experiments for some unknown pur pose. They argue that the agent s of t his activ ity would have access to \"subjec ts\" through the families of those in the mili tary an d intelligence organizations. W hile it is tr ue t hat most abductees have a family m ember in the m ilitary, that is also true of just about everyone in the country, so that cannot b e a significant factor. M ore telling would be an inordinatel y high number of abductees with family c onnec tions to t he intelligenc e community , and such cases a re r eported. A mong t he e ight w omen, however, there ar e only t wo confirmed, and one possible , wi th con nections to intelligence wo rk. These individual, very unique, abduction reports show such a commonal ity that they all could quite eas ily be from a s ingle s ource, or alliance of sources, with a single, specific agenda. Some of the repor ted det ails, in f act, whic h appear so unique in a giv en single case, are too stri king to di smi ss. One good example not li sted on the Chart i nvolves Pat and Angie, w hose conscious m emories and responses are very different. D uring Pat's childhood abduction, she asked for and was given a \"green healer rock\" as a 145"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"keeps ake, but when the m ilita ry interrogated the fa mily, they persuaded Pat's si ster to give the m the rock. In Angie's case, a green rock was also conf iscated. She didn't c onsciou sly conne ct the beauti ful green rock with alien experiences, nor could she remember precisely when and wher e she first got it. But Angie d oes remember, as a child, being approached on the playground one day by an unknown woman. The w oman knew Angie's name and a few things about her, claiming to be a friend of the girl's teacher. After a bri ef initial chat, the woman told Angie that s he knew about the green rock and asked if she coul d have it. Angie recalls givi ng her the rock duri ng a second encounter, al though the details are cloudy. There are other su ch minute similari ties in just th ese ei ght accounts , and the details on the C hart generally are true not only for the eight women but also for thousands of other s. There is one more set of paral lels, howev er, which was not on t he Ch art becaus e it pert ained exc lusively to the wo men in t his pr oject rat her than to the typi cal abdu ction situation. I w as in contact w ith all of them separately for months before deci ding to compile a book-length report about the cases, and dur ing that t ime, although strange things st ill occ urred, they did n ot seem any di fferent from pas t a ctivi ties . Things changed, however, afte r Jane and A my were gi ven m essages telling them to work with me specifically. I began t he book project, and in the course o f taking care of necessary business through the m ail, it soon became clear that many of my l etters to the w omen were being diverted. It w as an annoyance, but a mi nor one. But then t he women began having serious problems, physical afflictions of a suspic iously similar natur e. Beth was first. On the night she decided to part icipate in t he pr oject, she phoned a friend to discuss the deci sion, but in the midst o f the conversation the line wen t dead. That night, she had dist urbing but cloudy dr eam s, and t he next m orning b oth her legs from knees to ankles were in e xcruciating pain for no apparent reason. And then she had a sudden, fri ghten ing flashback that linked the m ysterious p ain w ith military per sonnel wa rning her not to be a par t of the book . That was i n early October 1993 . Three weeks later, a fter discussing my determination to do the p rojec t w ith o ne of the w omen , I w ent to b ed i n fine shape and wo ke up at 6 a.m. with wrack ing, spasmodic pains in both legs, from my knees to my ankles. It was unbeli evably bad, unlike any pain I've had before, and after s wallowing ibu prof in I hobbled back to bed and tried to sleep. I mu st have, for I dreamed after t hat, seeing myself s urrounded by military personnel who w ere injecting something into m y knees. They taunted me, saying, \"Don't think you can do anything y ou want. This is just a little dem onstr ation that we c an br ing y ou, lit erally, to your knees any time we c hoose.\" For Beth and me, these may have been mere d reams, reflecting our fears about the project. But Anita's report of experiencing this same pain after an abduction, years before, makes i t harder to discount a connection.

It w as in N ovember, too, that A ngie recalls military personnel threatening punishment if she \" talked to Karla Turner.\" Was i t a real event, a VR S, or just a dream?

To conclude, then, the Comparati ve Chart shows h ow consistently the same details turn up in unrelated abduction scenarios, and indeed how many consistent det ails actually comprise the phenomenon.

The evidence f urther m akes a st rong case f or a very physical, technological basis to alien- human interactions. Unless angels perform rect al probes, however, and make crank phone calls, and arrange sexual liaisons in addition to t heir other heavenly d uties, the case is very weak for this being a primarily s piritual agenda.   147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"XII - The Round Table When these personal accounts are brought t ogether for an overview, the women have three major concerns, in common with many others who h ave had forced alien encounters. What are the aliens s aying, and can we believe them? What are they d oing with us, technologically a nd p sychologically? And what is the real nature of human or military involvement in the abduction activiti es? On this last issue, every one of the w omen have reported seeing ot her humans present in abduct ion situations. Amy, Angie, Lisa, Pat and Beth recall e xperiences that involved m ilitary pers onnel, and in m ost instances there were aliens wor king with the huma ns. Although some of these scenes may have been a lien V RS p roductions, o ther p eripheral a ctivities do indicate actual human invol vement. A ngie, for inst anc e, was con fronte d and int imidated b y uniformed men in the pickups that pinned her b etween them on the highway, just hours before she had a military abd uction and was threatened about \"talking.\" When Am y traveled o ut of state f or regr essive hypnosi s, a not her suspi cious event occ urred. A high-ranking naval officer, a long -time acquaintance of the hypnotist's family, showed up at their home late on the ni ght of Amy's arriv al, in s pite of being t old t hat it would not be convenient to visit at that ti me. He proceeded to deliver t he standard \"line\" that the m ilitary has no interest, much less involvement, wi th U FOs, aliens, or abductees. He said that in twenty-five years of service he had never even heard another m ilitary person m ention UF Os, on or o ff the record. And he insisted that abd uctees had no busine ss presenting thei r experiences to the public unles s the y could als o off er \"concr ete, scient ific evid enc e\" that anything had happened. I was pres ent that night, and when I asked him if he ac tually coul d tell us of an y mi litary involvement with UFO s, assuming it did exist, he adm itted that \"national s ecurity\" restri ctions would force him to d eny such involvement. When Amy left to dr ive home, s he was followed b y a state patrol car who stayed inches from her bumper or right bes ide her car for many mi les. The effect, o f cou rse, was extre mely unnerving, and Amy felt it was m eant to be an intimidation, as do those w ho have had m ilitary helic opt er har assm ent, phone dist urbanc es, and other ev ents t hat seem much m ore hum an than alien in origin. If, as was mentioned earlier, there is proof in even one case that m ilitary personnel have been involved in abductions, then the other reports should not be e asily dismissed. Each person must decide what evidence is convincing on this issue, but I am satisfied t hat one case, Leah Haley's, is beyond question. If human agencies are indeed covertl y acti ve, thei r involvement demands more vigorous investigation t han has b een d one u p to n ow. M ainstream researchers, however, s how no enthusiasm for c onfronting possible human-right s violations by huma n force s, perhaps because they fear pe rsonal repri sal-whi ch, as many abduct ees c an a ttest, does o ccur. On the issue of alien commun ications, there is plenty of data from all of the women. Most of them have had personal messages in addition to hearing their nam es called. \"The communicati on that has happened when I'm awak e,\" Lisa r eported, as an 148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"example, \"is usually simple. Th ey say in my head, Turn of f the lights and don't come in here'.\" After Anit a was sexually assaulted by the humanoid in the red suit, he told her, \"I'll be there to h elp y ou,\" w hich was frightening rather than reass uring giv en the immediat e situation. And Amy had a curious message in late 1993, saying, \"All will know of UFOs on the day of the big game,\" although which big g ame was not identified. Some of the personal messages, described p reviously, made direct references to me, once the women began working to investigate their e xperiences. Jane was told to give al l her \"i nfo rma tion to Ka rla Turner\" and to as sist me in awaken ing others t o the abduc tion phenome non. Amy was comp elled t o contact m e by her influencing forces, and then w hen she c onsci ousl y asked th em i f they had any message for me, they told her to tell me, \"Do take c are. Lock your doors-i t may hel p more than you know .\" The message was so absurd that Amy c hallenged it and was told, \"S he will know what it means.\" When A my wrote me , she di d not pass a long that message, although she typed i t and put it a way. Months later, when she was listening to a tape of a public presentati on I had made, however, she heard me say that at one point I was so disheartened by the alien ac tiv ity that I didn't even bother to lo ck m y doors. Shocked by the correlation , sh e finally tol d me about the mes sage she' d got ten earlier. And when Polly asked her \"spirits,\" as she called the unseen communicators, about this book project, she w as given a lengthy reply. In part, they sa id t hat t he book \" is a j ourney into another level of mind\" and that my books \"are a part of a much larger work from whic h she cannot be separated...an expansive work of lov e, resting on a solid base.\" It i s impossibl e not to w onder w hat these speci fic p ersonal references mean. They certainly show that s ome force or group is aware of the c onnections between th e wome n and m y resea rch, w hich m ay acc ount for the helicopter f lights and telephone interfer enc e so m any of us hav e had. Dur ing a phone conversation with Angie , in fa ct, a s we discussed one alien group's cl aim to originate in Cassiopei a, a man's v oice interrupted to say, 'There's a lot of them out t here, and we k now where they com e from\"- an d th en the voice was gone. These references als o demonstrate foreknow ledge of certain even ts or the ability to direct events, for w hoever gave Amy the message about my locking the d oor seems to hav e k nown s he w ould lat er, m uch later, hea r a tape of my remar ks. These speci fic references connect our separ ate ex periences wi thi n a l arger or ganiz ed agenda, that much is clear, al though t he c oordi nators of this activ ity are not, and it seems t o be quite a long-term project. Many of the wom en had alien comm unic ations very early in their lives. Anita reported being told as a c hild that \"The children must be protect ed. \" Amy ha d m essages an d ideas impressed into her m ind from as young as four, and like Polly she felt the i mpact of these influences in her earl y teen years. She also felt that the aliens implanted or stored information within the subconscious, in \"packets\" of knowledge, reminiscent of the \"pockets\" of knowledge the aliens tol d me I possessed in 1980. Throughout thei r li ves, severa l women recalled t eaching or trai ning communi cati ons. For Amy, these included information about vari ous aspects of physics, as w ith Polly, as 149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"well as lessons in telekinesis and penetrating solid objects. A ngie's training has foc used on using her m ental powers, and Anita's prope lled her to study usef ul survival skills. This training or pr ogr amm ing of abductees i s meant to serve some pur pose, but we have only the aliens' c laims for what that pur pose may be. Much of w hat the aliens have communicated has a ffected the women's attitudes on a variety of subjects. In childhood, Amy wit nessed an apparent V RS designed to destroy her faith in traditional religion, and Polly reported l essons on \"changes in a llegiance.\" Anit a, Jane, and Amy also have c ome to fe el suspi cious of temp oral go vernmen ts, a suspicion that Jane says was \"fostered\" by the aliens. Such an attitude adjustment is clearly an intrinsic part of the a bduction a genda, point ing t o a m uch m ore inv olved a nd disturbing program than the mere taking of genetic m aterial to revivify a degenerative alien race. Their actions conc ern changing our belief system as m uch as working, for whatever reason, with our bodies, and we do not know the motivation for this t argeting of reli gion and gov ernm ent. On the subject of human genes is, the aliens often say they are our creators, as in Angie's case, and s tatements about altering our species w ere also m ade to Lisa. The most provocative message, gi ven to Amy, indic ated a s urprise on the part of t he aliens that Amy hadn't clearly seen the si tuati on al ready. \"D id you t hink this was all by accident?\" she was asked, as the aliens presented the concept of the earth as a cosmic z oo. Suc h indoctrination serves to reduce our concepts of hu ma n sove rei gnty, as w ell as to bind us to them in a subservient position, as a possession. While some p eople accept this relationship as fact and thus al low that the aliens c an legitimat ely do with us what they please, there are others of us w ho feel w e possess an inherent sovereignty and right to exist without interference, no m atter w hat our genesis. Their claims to be our creators have never been more than mere claims, a nyway, u nless there is p roof somewh ere, a s a few researchers report from intelligence and military i nsiders. As for information on the aliens themselves, they a re less forthcoming. Lisa was told that there are \"many divisi ons\" of the beings, and Jane has o bserved that while some of t hem a re interdi mensional, as Polly also beli eves, others are ac tually \"interplanetary trav eler s.\" A n or igin in Cassi opei a was stated to A ngi e, al though the alien said their group had lo ng ago m ade a \" hom e\" f or themselves on our planet. Beth was told only that the aliens are here for study and to \"avert a destr uctive process\" that humani ty is bringing upon the world. T he most extreme communication of origin, however, was given to P at. S he w as told that the aliens are angels, although not as we'd been taught to think of t hem, and t hat they will be resp onsible for the c hanging of human bodies at the ti me of resurrecti on. J ane, conversely, has been made to see, from her experiences , that the God of the Bible \"is n ot the supr eme being we have been taught to en vision .\" A common communication has been that the abd uctees are to come together or \"find \" others like themselves. In fact, Angie report ed being brought to a g roup of \"Chosen Ones\" in an underground faci lity. \" Ther e wer e other s trained lik e m e,\" Am y said she w as told in 1989, \"and we would come together soon. Now it i s time that we find each other.\" Beth was told that she and others must work as \"spiritual\" beings \" for the good of humanity ,\" and 150"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"the aliens told J ane that \"All good people of earth m ust com e together to resist what is com ing.\" It isn't cert ain, of course, that all the communic ations have come from a single source, and in fact there are frequent ly contr adic tions and inconsi stenci es fro m cas e to case. The f uture planet ary events ar e als o a m ajor t opic for the aliens, and it is int erest ing to note the ph rases and images they use h ere. For Jane, the a liens have u sed t erm s lik e \"the awakening\" to i ndicate coming c hanges in \"world cultures and consciousness.\" This soun ds positive an d peac eful enou gh, but bot h Am y and P olly have been told of a co ming \"Armageddon,\" although Amy w as told that Armageddon \"will not be as people think it will be.\" A ngle's ab ductor s sa id that the \"filth and evil\" in this world will be cleansed as we are subtly changed. But for A nita and Li sa, the f uture changes are shown as disasters for wh ich the y must pr epare to survive here on earth. And Pat has been show n scenes of the return of Jesus, ac companied by spac e ships and aliens, preceding the \"bad time on earth\" which will destroy m any of those who are not rescued. Indeed, to Amy, B eth, Jane, and Polly, the communications have indic ated a war of good and evil under way, in which w e have a part to play. And as for the aliens' prom ised as sist anc e, Lisa has said s imply, \"W hy should we believe they can fi x ou r probl ems when t hey can' t ev en cont rol the ab us ive al iens among t hem?\" How do the women feel about thei r alien communications? Jane is inspired by m uch of w hat she's told, but she has not been able to initiate t he communicati ons hersel f. In fact, she feels that the aliens have hidden, in a w ay, b ehind thei r contacts. \" We're not seeing the true intelli gence be hind all these scenes,\" she once said. Polly says t hat when she cons ider s al l s he h as bee n t old, she c oncludes that in reality, 'They have told us nothi ng .\" A nd A my has complained that in spite of all she's been tol d and t aught, the aliens \"don't give [p ractical] information.\" Angi e has come to be suspi cious of m uch of what she has been t old. 'Ther e's no reas on I should trust those aliens,\" she wrote, \"any m ore than I would trust my own kind.\" And Anita has echoed that fe eling. \"I'm alway s ama zed when I get any infor mation fr om them at all ,\" she said. \"I really don't know if so meone who would abduct a pers on c ould be trusted to give a t ruthful answer to any question.\" The second issue focuses on alien technology as o bserved by the abductees. Besides the various instr uments used in exam inat ions, mo st of which are compl etely fo reign, i t is curious to note how of ten the aliens employ quite fami liar equipment, es pec ially n eedles and injections. Indeed, some researchers have s aid that this use of mundane technology argues agains t an alien f orce a nd t owar d covert hum an activi ty. Angie, B eth, and P olly all report get ting shots, and the other women have sometimes found i njection pun ctures wi thout remembering how they got them. But the m ost common technological devices are not at all human-li ke: the probes. Thei r d escriptions are often very similar -small balls of light f loating or bouncing through the house-but in Amy's case the p robe w as rather m ore \"spidery\" in appearance. As m entioned ear lier, t here is a strong interest in hum an brains ev inced by the aliens' act ivities. Amy , An gie , Bet h, Lis a, Pat an d Pol ly all reported having s ome operation perf ormed on their 151"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"brains, and they often used the exact same descriptions, of feeling as if thei r skulls were opened and thei r brains temporarily r emoved. But by far the most alarm ing ev idenc e of al ien technology concerns the \"new \" bodi es and \"clones\" they manufacture. Whethe r these are really bodies for a future human \"resurrection,\" as Pat was told, remains to be seen, for other ex planati ons have been g iven. In a case privately reported, for inst ance, a m an was told that a d uplicate o f his body could be us ed to \"replace\" him if he didn't \"cooperate\" with the aliens . Lisa, too, was told t hat ot her people wouldn't be able t o distinguis h her cloned body from the original, if th ey chos e to r eplace her. And Angie wa s shown the cloned infants as part of a \"novel breed\" the aliens are p roducing. Polly has a different take on what may be goin g on wit h the b aby pres ent ations. \"Wh at's th e point?\" she asked. \"N ot to nurtu re thi s crossb red i nfant, not to teac h the ETs about emotiona l love and physical bonding, but to blow our goddamn m inds. They use our bodi es to get to our minds and emotions.\" She doesn't bel ieve they care anythi ng about our bodies, \" except that WE care v ery muc h, so that is why our bodies are im portant to them: to get at our caring.\" This view is echoed by Angie. When she was s hown one of her \"hybrid\" offspring, she felt that the present ation was a test of he r rather than anything to do with t he baby its elf. \"From that particular experience, I learned that the hybrid presentation liturgy is not a bonding exercise,\" she concluded. \"In reality it is an act of scrutiny against the mother's measure of courage and understanding. It has a lo t to do with m ental pain and how the mother deals with i t.\" Concerning the clones or hybr ids themselves, she was further told that their soul s are \"recycled\" and that they are regenerated many times. This fits in w ith o ther reports in which abductees saw the ali ens d estroy fetuses and were told they are not \"really alive\" and that their physical material will be us ed, not wasted. In fact, these and other reports point to t he use of human genetic material to produce the G ray w orke rs, quite possibly biological \"robots\" rather than livi ng, soul -inhabited, entities. The other major technological q uestion c oncerns t he implants, for which the aliens have given various explanations. When Jane received an ear implant, she w as told that it affects \"brain chemic als and certain s ubtle functions.\" The aliens told A ngie that the implants \"act as a magnet and pull inf ormation f rom p eople's brains\" as well as enhanc ing the us e of \"spec ial s enses\" and se ndi ng \"i nstructi ons.\" But A my w as given very different information about the implant s by the masked alie n who removed hers. Besides being shown where the implants are placed and the fact that they operate on the a bductee's own electrical brain activity, she was also told how the implants are used to control abducte es, punish th em, and even kill them. And al though no one was tol d that the impl ants a re used to create the virtual-reality scenarios, that possibility m ust be considered. The technology behind the VRS is a subject u pon w hich the al iens hav e been s ilent, but th e eff ects of the VRS are apparent. O nly Amy has been given any information about the images created by aliens, when she was told that they use frightening images for control. O ne of the aliens told Angie that the m ilitary also uses \"illusions,\" but this was not ex plained. 152"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Several o f the w ome n ha ve th eir ow n idea s ab out what is behin d the virtual-realit y scenar ios .

Pat is the on ly one who had u nequivocally pos itive feelings and trust in the a liens-before her encounter wi th the \"oriental gi rl\" in the underground facil ity, th at is-for her perc eption of t hem has been shaped sinc e her childhood to see them as ange lic beings. Jane, An gie, and Beth all r ecognize posit ive and neg ative fo rce s amon g the ali ens, and wh ile Am y has bee n threat ene d and silenced through the years by the aliens, she still says, \"I don't think all aliens are bad. I don't even consider the Grays that are abus ing humans and other lif e f orms as 'bad '- they h ave their reasons a nd think diff erently from us, so they probably do not understand our feelings.\" Angie goes further, saying, \" Perfectly real a liens ex ist out there , and it seems o ne kind wants to help us and another kind wants to deceive us.\" Anita has r ecogniz ed differing agendas among the groups who have interacted w ith her. S he thinks the G rays care very little about humans perso nally, the humanoids are involved with sexual aspects of the phenomenon ( from her conscious recolle ctions, at least ), and t he T ans are conc erned t o bind us t o them thr ough our e motions. Polly has ex presse d man y ideas abou t the alien agen da. \"I know m any feel they [aliens] need r eproductive material from us,\" she wrote, \"but the w ay it feels to me is, although there may be the aspect that w e a re a resource, it feels like a h ighly sophi sticated mind game.\" And she recognizes, as has Anita, that the m ind game can be very effecti ve. \" Intelle ctually I can s ay, 'They are out for cont rol; don't trust them', \" Polly has confided. \"But, Karla, emoti onall y an d deep i n my mind I trust certai n ones of them more than anyt hing else in the univ erse. And I hav e b een conf ront ing b it by bit the evidenc e that they m ade m e feel this w ay for their purposes, to fulfill their ag enda, not for m y good. The depth of m y trust, I thi nk, is more frighteni ng than the depth of my fear.\" Like Anita, she recogni zes the di rected n ature of her response. 'Thei r c ons isten t the me is con trol ,\" she co ntinued . \"It is maddening to realize that alt hough we strive to empower ourselves and k now that we can c laim and e nforce our own mental sovereignty, still so often t hey slip by our defenses...and ow n parts of us which b y rights we should have in our conscious p ossession.\" In spite of what some promi nent abduction t heorists tell us about avoiding thinking in terms of \"good and evil\" or \" positive and negative\" when it c omes to the aliens, this simply c annot be done, nor should it be. For these women, for my husband and m yself, for all abductees, kno wing that we have been made a part of this agenda and that we 153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"have been i mplanted, trained, and programmed to participat e in s ome future scenario, how can we not ask to what purpose our minds, bodies, and souls will be used?

More i mmediately, what can be done to alter the a bduction situation? Is there any sign that things are changing? The answer is a caut ious yes, there is ev ide nce of a chan ge in the 'standard o perating procedure' of abduc tion events over the last forty or f ifty years. On the part of the aliens, there seems to have been a q uantitative a nd q ualitative increase in abduction a ctivity since the mid-1980s in thi s country. Whereas most ev ents in the past were deeply suppr essed in th e abductees' memories, by 1986 hundreds, if not thous ands, of abductees began to remember past e xperiences and to be mor e currently aware of new o nes. Either the aliens were not doing a good job of suppr essing the memories, or somet hing was triggering a w ake-up c all in the abduc tees . Fur the r, more abductees were report ing a v ariety of alien phy sical types , not just the small Gray work ers t ypically encountered in the past. An argum ent c an be made that this awarene ss w as initiated deliber atel y by the aliens, as part of the preparation for the predicted coming global ev ent in w hich abductees will be acti vated to perform t heir \" tasks.\" But a differ ent ar gum ent can als o be made, that abductees w ere w aking up on thei r own, m any times \"seei ng through\" the illus ions an d v irtua l-real ity scenari os as Anita did when she told the Tan entity who w as projecting love toward her, 'Too bad it isn't real.\" In several recent r eport s, in f act, abductees have penetrated the aliens' ill usions and refused to c ooperate as the aliens would have had t hem do. The grow th and changes resulting from a lien contact m ay yet prove to be a double-edged sword, giving abducte es a heighten ed aware ness and psychic p erception that allows them to evaluate and reac t to their s ituat ions in ways they could not have done b efore. It has been said that any species, in an environment of extreme stress and quest ionable survival, m ay develop new coping m echanisms to ensure that the species continue to exist. Could this be p art of what is happening now? Certainly an i ntrusion of an advanced, controlling force on a widespread scale could generate enough \"species stress\" t o trigger new response mechanisms. Studies o f h uman c onsciousness d evelopment theor ize that the emer gence of bicameralism-the division of the psyc he int o conscious and s ubc ons ciou s components-occurred relati vely recently in human evolution, perhaps no m ore than five thousand years ago, in a f airly sudden way a nd wit h no known pr ec ipit ating c ause. Could it be that we are once again exper iencing a psychic change, a m ovement toward \"tricameralism\" that will give us a new form o f c onscious p erception? Ar e we developin g new abilities to re cognize e nergi es an d ent ities which have hit hert o been beyond our ken, and thus new ways to respond? 154"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Many people who see alien interaction as a p ositive event for humanity point to the growth and changes abduct ees often evince as proof that the aliens are wor king to elevate the psyc hic abilities of o ur race.

My IQ and r ecept iveness t o learning has improved a lo t, and I am more in tune to nature as well as myself and other human beings.\" Defenders of alien i nteraction claim that these so rts of changes are a deliberate product of t he contact experience, e vidence of the aliens' benevolent interest in humanity. It is odd, however, that suc h growth seems to come to abductees only after they are aware of their experi ences. If i ndeed thi s gr ow th i s produced by the alie ns, then i t shoul d have been ther e long bef ore t he abductees we re conscious of their encoun ters, since i n almost every reported case there are signs of alien involvement since ear ly childhood. The psychic increas e and growt h of perc eptive abilities, however, occurring after the abduct ee is aware o f the intrusions, may indicate a different genesis-an i nternal evolution of consci ousness-s tem mi ng from our need to know what is and has been done to us and what we can do to m eet the situation in a m ore empowered posit ion.
