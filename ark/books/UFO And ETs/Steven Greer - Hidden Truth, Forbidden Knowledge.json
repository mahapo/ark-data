Allen HynekThe human experiment on planet Earth is on the verge of self- destruction.Looking at the threats of nuclear war, the chemical and biological ecocide,global climate change, proliferating weapons on Earth and in space, the greed ofcorporations, and the gross cronyism and mismanagement of the U.S. government,the bloated military budgets and aggression, the distractions of our culturalconditioning, the spread of fear and ignorance, the suppression of life-savingtechnologies, the disparity of wealth and poverty among us, it is amazing we arestill here. Barely.Do we have any hope? My answer is, we can only try. And if we do try, where canwe find the answers? Enter Dr. Steven Greer.Almost twenty years ago I first met Steve Greer at a lecture I gave at the UnityChurch in Arden, North Carolina. Having left my career as a mainstream spacescientist at Princeton University and Science Applications InternationalCorporation, I was then beginning to liberate myself from the confines andexpectations of Western science. I was also intensely studying the UFO/ETphenomenon rejected by most of my fellow scientists. Now I felt free to exploreand express our transcendent reality.So was Steve. A brilliant young ER physician with UFO/ET experience, Dr. Greerand I talked into the night when we first met. We began to make connections wewere both just beginning to understand: that ET visitations were not only real,they could assist us in overcoming the human-caused global crisis. Since then,Steve has provided amazing leadership in penetrating the mysteries not only ofthe phenomenon itself, but the shadowy corners of U.S. government and corporatecoverup of it. As a result, Dr. Greer has proven himself time and time again asa fearless and energetic warrior on the leading edge of planetary change.First he founded the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence(CSETI), in which he introduced the concept of ambassadorship between humans andoff-planet cultures—but this time not merely science fiction. Holding all-nightexpeditions in UFO hot spots around the world, his groups would vector inviiicraft through the use of lights, sounds and visualization which he coined asClose Encounters of a Fifth Kind, aka. CE-5. The workshops continue to beoffered to interested students.Then he embarked on the difficult task of locating and receiving video/DVDtestimonies of over one hundred U.S. government UFO/ET witnesses under TheDisclosure Project, culminating in a major press conference in Washington, D.C.,in May 2001. These revelations underscore a long, sordid history of governmentaland media secrecy and the acquisition of technologies such as microelectronics,anti-gravity propulsion and zero-point, or \"free\" energy, from our visitors.This massive cover-up has been going on for almost six decades, since the UFOcrash near Roswell, New Mexico in July 1947, an event which was certainly notcaused by balloons, as alleged by the U.S. Air Force. Such myths are onlyaccepted by the ignorant or the powerful and their subjects.Dr. Greer's pioneering work on disclosure inevitably led to furtherunderstanding the depth and credibility of ET contact accounts as well as thecover-up itself, for example, the \"above top secret\" research going on near theinfamous Groom Lake, Nevada and elsewhere.Steve Greer is a spiritual warrior of high calling, juxtaposed against thoseforces identifying themselves as the \"United States\". The latter are criminalswho must be brought to justice, for so many reasons evident to ever more of us,as we watch the fall of the American empire. Dr. Greer, more than anyone, hasproduced the clearest evidence of a UFO/ET cover-up and now it is up to the restof us to embrace it. \"Hidden Truth- Forbidden Knowledge\" gives us the mostup-to-date account of the vast accumulation of that evidence from anautobiographical perspective. It's a story about disclosure of the greatestmysteries of our time from a courageous soul unbeholden to the tyrannies thatgrip us in the most powerful nation on Earth.Just as importantly, it provides us with a narrative of the benign nature ofthese off-planet cultures, that we are being visited by those who are empatheticabout the human condition, while at the same time not directly interfering (theso-called Prime Directive made famous by Star Trek). It is sobering to thinkthat, only since the United States pioneered the nuclear age in 1945, causingthe most frightening devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the modernsightings, contacts and technology transfers have been taking place. Thelong-range atomic bombers were stationed in Roswell, the bomb was created in LosAlamos, the first one exploded in Alamagordo, and missiles to deliver futurebombs were tested in White Sands—all in New Mexico, a nexus of themilitary-industrial complex. Was it just coincidence that the 1947 Roswell UFOcrash also happened there? Doubtful: the horrors of nuclear technology wouldmake any compassionate ET race want to rush to that area, as they have eversince to military and nuclear installations elsewhere.IxPerhaps they are helping to prevent the horrors they too don't wish to seeunleashed by irresponsible humans.We Earthlings need all the help we can get, so why not embrace the phenomenonfor what it is, to marvel at the wonder, leaving behind our cultural biases?Only through expanding our knowledge and taking political action can we make theneeded shifts, and that is what Dr. Greer is so good at doing.In many ways, the UFO phenomenon tells us more about ourselves than about ourmysterious visitors, and the mirror they hold in front of us is frightening—yethopeful, if we listen to Dr. Greer's words. For example, his founding of SpaceEnergy Access Systems (SEAS) is providing support to inventors withrevolutionary new energy technologies that could give the world clean, cheap anddecentralized energy, thus ending the oil, coal, and nuclear Age and the virtualend of human-caused pollution and climate change. We at the New Energy Movementare working closely with SEAS Power and other organizations to advocate theimportance of R&D of new energy technologies, currently suppressed by powerfulvested interests.On the evening of my first meeting with Dr. Greer, the Unity minister ChadO'Shea presented me with a bumper sticker, \"The truth shall set you free butfirst if will piss you off.\" If we allow ourselves to vent about, not to deny,our dire circumstances, and then move onto solutions, we might have a chance asa civilization.This courageous work is not for the meek. Many cutting-edge scientists have beenthreatened, murdered, and otherwise suppressed by cascades of disinformation andpersonal attacks. Dr. Greer has endured all this, to our benefit.This book could be the most important you will read. It is not only full oftranscendent truths, it is a call to action to shift the paradigm fromterrestrial tyranny to peaceful, sustainable and just cosmic community.Apollo Astronaut, Dr. Brian O'Leary, 14 Sept. 05x"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION:Hidden Truth-Forbidden KnowledgeIn April of 2004, about 25 people gathered at our country home in AlbemarleCounty, Virginia, not far from Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. The purpose wasfor me to provide an oral history, over the course of a week, of the events ofmy life.This book is the result of that gathering.To be honest, this book is released with more than a little trepidation. Itreveals personal experiences and events that frankly seem incredible. Evenreading through the transcript of the tapes was at times a tearful andemotionally difficult experience. And I know that much of it can be used toattack me personally.But it is time for you to know: Why did an emergency physician who had beenchairman of a busy ER leave his career to get out to the world the informationthat we are not alone? What had I personally experienced--from childhoodonwards--that gave me the knowledge of cosmic cultures, cosmic consciousness anda glimpse of the wondrous future that awaits humanity? What are the new energyand propulsion technologies that can give us a new world, free of pollution,poverty and conflict? What is the nexus where Mind, Space, Time and Matter allcome together- and how might this be used technologically by an advancedcivilization? What does the blue-print of the next 500,000 years of humancivilization on earth look like - and how can we transition to that time? Whatdid I find- and experience - as I met with heads of state, CIA officials,billionaires and covert operatives who in turns are desperate to maintain thesecrecy and yet pray for relief from the black box they have nailed shut aroundthem? Who has been keeping this Hidden Truth and Forbidden Knowledge secret -and most importantly, why?This book addresses all this - and more. It is my own Disclosure. Having foundedand led The Disclosure Project, I feel it is time that the millions of peoplewho follow our work know the truth about how I got here - and what I have found.I do not expect the general reader to accept all of this -or perhaps any of it.I expect nothing in fact. It is the truth as I have found it and this is myheartfelt effortxito share that truth. I hope you find some meaning in this sharing from my heartand mind.A meeting I had with a senior General at the Pentagon a few years agoillustrates the gravity of the situation. I had been asked by this General, whoat the time was head of a major intelligence operation in the Pentagon, to briefhim and some of his staff on the UFO issue. As our military advisor and I waitedin the General's reception room, we noticed a female officer looking up from herpapers at us, curiously. Finally she asked if I was Dr. Greer, and I said yes.She then proceeded to explain that they were very excited about the briefing andthat she and her colleagues had drawn straws to see who could be in attendance!Apparently, only one officer from her office could be present.We were escorted into the General's conference room and some time into thebriefing this General said, \"Well, I have no doubt that what you are sharing istrue, but I have made inquiries through channels in my Agency and nobody cantell me anything! In fact, all I have gotten is this!\" He then went over to abook shelf and took a small ET doll down - and held it up for all to see. Hesaid, \"This is all I have gotten - ridicule- for inquiring about this throughchannels...\"I then explained that the CIA Director and other high officials had similarexperiences when they made inquiries into the subject.This senior General then told me a disturbing and exquisitely personal story:When he was young, his father had discovered a corrupt enterprise and conspiracyin the government that was deeply disturbing- but nobody would listen to him. Itwas a matter of enormous importance - but even the General admitted he justthought his father was a kook. Eventually, his father committed suicide (or wasmurdered and made to look like a suicide) over the matter. Then the Generalsaid, \"It wasn't until I got into this position at the Pentagon that I realizedthe old man was right!\"Until the General was confronted with the truth as a high official in thePentagon, he never believed his own father. So how can I expect you to believeme? All I can do is share with you the truth as I know it and the rest is up toyou.A few comments on the book: It is not a written book, but merely an editedtranscript of over 45 hours of audio tape that were created in April of 2004during my oral presentations at our farm. I ask that the reader forgive anyerrors or editing oversights. This book should be viewed as an oral history,transcribed and edited into a narrative. I had no notes or text as I made theseoral presentations.Between 1991 and 1995, I kept a diary (via transcribed audio tape) that was over2000 pages just up to that time. Clearly this book, which encompassesexperiences that span half a century, can only reflect the major highlights andlessons gleaned over that time. It is by no means meant to be all-inclusive orrecall all thexiiinformation conveyed to me by thousands of conversations and meetings withcovert contacts within the Shadow Government.Many of the names of these covert operatives are changed or abbreviated.However, the original tapes and transcripts, which are in multiple securelocations, contain all of the names, corporations and entities involved withthese illegal clandestine operations and will be released, if needed, at a latertime.Also, this book is not a recapitulation or even summary of the extensivedocumentation which exists in my two prior books. The reader should refer to theextensive case-files and ET contact experiences of the Center for the Study ofExtraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI) contained in the book \"ExtraterrestrialContact- The Evidence and Implications\". Moreover, a nearly 600 page book ofgovernment documents and transcripts of over 60 top- secret witness testimoniesto official government projects and events is available in \"Disclosure\". Thesebooks may be obtained at www.DisclosureProject.org.It is time for one chapter in human history to close and another to open. Do wehave the courage to embrace this new world, the hallmarks of which are universalpeace, enlightenment, and a genuinely high technology civilization on earth thatis sustainable for thousands of years? The retrograde forces that are attemptingto hijack humanity to a time of war in space, global destruction, environmentalruin and cultural insanity must be supplanted, through the courageous acts ofothers, with an entirely new way of being.It is time for you to know - and for all of us to act. For it is only throughthe collective actions of those who yearn for the good future that awaitshumanity that we can leap across the abyss of impending destruction and secure aworld ready to take her place among the cultures of the cosmos, enlightened andat peace.Steven M. Greer MD Albemarle County, Virginia 1 February 2006xiii"},{"pageContent":"AUTHOR’S NOTEThis story is told in three parts. The first of these illuminates the eventsthat set the stage for all to follow; it covers my childhood through early adultlife, up to 1990. The second traces the years from 1990 to the present day.During this time, we formed the Center for the Study of ExtraterrestrialIntelligence, the Disclosure Project, and Space Energy Access Systems. The thirdpart moves into the future, gazing into a time when the fulfillment of thepromise of humanity will be realized -a time that will endure for 500,000 years.In order to first give you a frame of reference, I'll share some importantstatistics. In 1980, the world community eradicated smallpox off the face of theearth. The World Health Organization predicts that by the end of 2006, we willreach the last remote villages of Africa and Asia and we will wipe out Polio.These are accomplishments that should bring much gratification to us all ascitizens of this world. Yet, it is with restrained joy that I celebrate thesefeats. Why? Because, sadly, by the time you read the first chapter of this book(approximately 15 minutes), the following will happen: 250 children will die ofstarvation; 15 people will die of AIDS; 31 will die of Malaria and 50 will dieof TB.You might ask how this possibly relates to ETs or CSETI or the DisclosureProject. It is all connected to control, power, religious ideology, and greed.We know that the technologies have existed (for many years) to alleviateSmall-Pox and Polio much earlier, plus the diseases I mentioned above, as wellas other ills that plague the world community. We know that technologies havebeen around that can supply the world with an abundance of energy without usingup our valuable natural resources. Unfortunately, the people who have access tothese technologies have not shared them with us.I mention this not to depress you, but because it is a reality. Yet it is areality that can be changed. As you read HIDDEN TRUTH - FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE, youwill see that changes have already begun in some of the very people who areinvolved with these technologies; changes that can and WILL make this a peacefulworld.xiv"},{"pageContent":"1 IMPROBABLE MESSENGER\"We'll get the little Holloman room for this event...It's all you'll need.\" \"Oh,no - we need the ballroom.\"\"But, that room is never used except for very large and important events.\" \"Thiswill be a very large and important event!\" \"\"You've got to be out of your mind.\"\"No, we need the entire ballroom!\"\"Well, the last time they filled the ballroom was when President Reagan wasthere!\" \"Just get it! Do it.\"\"Okay - you won't listen to me... but I'll get it.\"The room in question is The National Press Club ballroom in Washington, D.C. Theverbal wrangling between myself Dr. Steven Greer and a press agent, provedworthwhile on May 9, 2001. She kept her word, and my instinct proved to be ontarget! We watched the ball room fill to capacity: nearly two dozen televisioncameras and a battery of journalists assembled to hear and record statementsoffered by twenty one witnesses from military, intelligence, government,corporate and scientific organizations.The witnesses had stepped forward to relate their personal experiences withextraterrestrial vehicles (ETVs; aka UFOs) and extraterrestrial life forms. Morethan two hours of public testimony ensued, verifying the reality of ETV/UFOcontact and a largely unknown outcome: the interaction with extraterrestrialintelligence has produced advanced energy and propulsion technologies. Thisinformation has been kept secret from the masses for years.16The event marked the launch of the Disclosure Project; an outgrowth of years ofeffort by the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI). Itwas also a milestone in my personal journey, having moved from a career as anemergency room doctor living in Asheville, N.C into a new role - the unlikelycourier of a message that is insisting to be heard. It was one more step alongthe sometimes rocky path I'd stumbled upon as a nine-year old playing on thestreets of Charlotte, North Carolina.A sunny afternoon in 1965 saw me out roaming with the usual group ofneighborhood urchins. We were typical Southern kids, wandering about in searchof all manner of adventure - something to build, or see, or take home. Littlewere we prepared for what suddenly appeared in the southwest sky: a silver,oval-shaped, gleaming craft - obviously not an airplane or helicopter. It wasseamless, totally silent - and unlike anything we'd ever seen. After hoveringfor a short time, it instantly vanished.We felt this was something truly unusual. My family, predictably, passed off theincident as a childish musing. But my cohorts and I knew we'd seen something waybeyond the ordinary. It was my first encounter with an \"ETV,\" the term used bythe National Security Agency for extraterrestrial vehicles, also commonly knownas UFOs.Since that day, my sense of connection to that spacecraft has endured. Eventsover the next few weeks strengthened the tie: I experienced a series of luciddreams and night encounters with beings who were not from the Earth. Because Iwas simply a young boy I was able to take it \"all in stride\" - it seemed anatural result of the incident with my three friends. I believe the ETs werefocused on instilling in me an awareness and acceptance of things beyond theworld I could see. My innocence allowed me to view this without prejudice,although I didn't speak publicly about it (due to the potential ridicule) untila few years ago.But this early connection was life-altering. It was clearly the dawning of alarger search for truth that grew stronger as I matured.My interest and curiosity about these matters intensified, although I didn'thave another direct ET encounter for years. Until around the age of twelve, Iwould collect relevant articles from such magazines as \"True\", \"Argosy\" and\"Life\" as well as books about UFO encounters, and accumulated a large stash inmy closet! The idea of knowledge of people from other planets enthralled me, andfed into the sense of wonder and joy I felt when looking at the night sky. Fearnever entered my mind - it seemed as comfortable as home. So my approach to theidea of extraterrestrials was that their existence is understood, or a \"given,\"and that these beings are aware of our evolution on earth. This sense offamiliarity with the great17expanse of creation has always induced a sense of joy and peace, even as apreschooler. When out in nature, I gained this sense of something awake anddivine beyond everyday existence. I believe there was always something, like ahand on my shoulder, helping and guiding me toward a perception of awakeness, amysterious conscious presence that would open to me when I looked at the sky orplayed outdoors. There is a Persian expression: \"the best way to love God is tolove His creation.\" I was blessed with this reality in a very innocent,elemental way.It was an unconventional view of life, perhaps the natural outcome of an equallyunconventional childhood. I grew up in a deliciously eccentric Southern family.Mother was like Scarlett O'Hara blended with Bette Davis in \"Hush, Hush, SweetCharlotte\", mixed with a touch of Joan Crawford's \"Mommy Dearest\"! Father washalf Native American, his mother a Cherokee.But I was raised in a family that was extremely troubled. Children from suchdifficult backgrounds generally follow one of two life paths: they eithersuccumb to self-destructive habits and addictions, sometimes to the point ofsuicide, or find sufficient inner strength to build a meaningful and productivelife. I took the latter course, through the grace of God and the intervention ofthe seen and unseen world.In reality, I have perhaps never known of a more traumatic, dysfunctional familysituation than ours. Most people are unaware of this background; they see me asa successful physician and public figure(albeit somewhat eccentric at times!)and assume a conventional, normal upbringing.As a young adult, I once attended the movie \"Mommy Dearest\" with my twin sister.Afterward, we looked at each other and said, \"My God, that would've been thebest day of our childhood!\" People are horrified to hear this. Because ofparental alcoholism, and home conditions that often attend it, we children alsolived with elements of abandonment, neglect and abuse. I remember, as a littlepre-schooler, eating cigarette ashes, sand, and dirt when nothing else wasaround. As a medical doctor, I now realize this was at least providing some ofthe mineral supplements my body needed: one of those instinctual cravingsdemanded by the body to enable survival. I was frequently very sick, especiallyevery winter, with terrible pneumonias and bronchitis. My lungs still have scartissue from those bouts.However, blessings often become apparent through hardship. The challenges mademe one tough bird! Any bitterness I might have harbored from childhood hasdissipated through the realization that this made me strong - a survivor. By thetime I reached high school, I vowed to take hold of my life and turn it around,and did.Through some of those years I was actually self-supporting, with my ownapartment. I held down a job in a local restaurant, working each night until1:0018A.M., then rose at 6 each day to bicycle across the city to school. I managed tomaintain an A grade average, becoming an Honor Society student involved innumerous school activities.My budding sense of responsibility extended to my three sisters. I oftenunintentionally referred to them as \"my daughters\", so strong was my protective,caring instinct for them. Having parents who were anti- role models, I learnedhow not to do things. The challenges brought the realization that we all createour own future, and transcending the limitations of birth, poverty, abuse, orany other hardship is possible through the exertion of human will.I was far too busy during high school to become enthralled with the stuff of popculture that absorbed many teenagers from the late '60s through early '70s. Isimply didn't have access to the luxuries most middle class kids took forgranted, and basic survival was a constant preoccupation. Carousing with drugsand alcohol was out of the question!Instead, I began to read the Vedas (the ancient, sacred literature of India) andstudy Sanskrit. On my own I learned about meditation and the concept oftranscendence, which fit quite comfortably into my psyche. I'd been raisedoutside the confines of formal religion. My parents did not involve me in churchas a child (in fact, they were emphatically atheist). The lack of attachment toan institutional doctrine left me open to ideas that might have been outside thecomfort zone of someone growing up in a conventional religious tradition. Theresult is that I moved naturally into the realm of meditative experiences andhigher consciousness, without tutoring from outside parties. I taught myselfprayer and meditation, from reading as well as direct experience. Thesepursuits, coupled with my school involvement in environmental and peace issues,created a new layer of experience and growth in consciousness for me. It was atthis point the experience I now call \"non-locality of consciousness\" made itselfknown. When I could find free time, I loved to bicycle out into the countrysideseeking this connection.I'd lie in a field, and practice those techniques that had emerged from insideme. I'd find myself traveling to observe other parts of Charlotte, or to seeother areas of the Earth, or going out into space and seeing it clearly. Thisbecame routine. At the age of 15, a beautiful, unstoppable force was opening upinside of me, independent of any sort of tradition. It manifested completelyfrom within.And then, in the spring of 1973,1 injured my left thigh. I had made plans tobicycle from Charlotte to the barrier islands on the North Carolina coast, a 200mile trip. I neglected the injury and went ahead with my plans, traveling theentire distance to the coast in one day, then returning to my small efficiencyapartment, in Charlotte. A horrible infection developed in my leg, and spreadthrough my body.19I was so sick! Because of a too demanding work and school schedule I was rundown even before this happened. I was also poor, so seeing a doctor was out ofthe question. As a physician, now I know what happened to me: I became septic,which means my bloodstream was infected, accompanied by a very high fever. Therewas also skeletal muscle break down, overloading my kidneys. All these arepotentially fatal symptoms, and I was spiraling to that point: a 17 year-oldalone without a phone, trying to nurse myself back to health, not fullyunderstanding the severity of my condition. It brought me to a near-deathexperience, finding myself suddenly released from my body.I was carried out into the depths of space, where I already felt at home. Then Iexperienced what I now understand to be God consciousness, where myindividuality became faint as it merged with the effulgent, unbounded, pure,infinite Mind. There was no duality. It lasted for what seemed to be an eternitybecause a normal sense of time disappears in that state of being. I could seeall of creation, the vastness of the cosmos, and it was beautiful beyond words.There was nothing frightening about it - only infinite awareness, joy, and theperception of an endless perfect creation.Eventually, two brilliant, scintillating lights approached out of the stars. Inow understand them to be Avatars: Manifestations of God. They were notanthropomorphic or anthropocentric, but appeared as brilliant points of light -pure, conscious energy. These were the twin Avatars for our era.As the Avatars approached me, I entered a state of oneness with them. It wasincredibly beautiful. Then there was a conveyance of knowledge in a pre-verbalform; before and beyond words. It's as if when you say \"apple,\" within the wordis the actual image of the apple, which could be astral (a light form). Andwithin that conscious image is the pure idea form of the apple itself - itsessence. That is how information was being transmitted to me.I have no sense of how long this union with God lasted. I was affected by thebeauty of it all, yet very overwhelmed at the same time.Eventually, the episode moved into more of a linear style of communication. Oneof the Avatars said, \"You may come with Us or return to Earth.\" I had thepresence of mind to ask, \"Well, what is Your will?\" And the Being replied,\"Well, it's Our desire that you go back to Earth to do other things.\" With that,I became depressed, having no interest at that point in coming back to Earth. Iwould have been very happy to remain in that state of awareness, in that placeof the place-less. But I somehow knew the highest response of human will isacceptance of the Divine will, and said, \"Okay, then.\"And with that, I acknowledged their reality and the very exalted celestialbeings that exist and the existence of the Godhead and the oneness of creationand divinity.20And that's what I experienced: complete, perfect oneness of unbounded Mind andcreation as one. Then I sort of lost consciousness, and fell back into my body,just sort of whoosh.I was back in my body, but must have been out long enough to lose consciousconnection with all of my neural centers, although my sensory input was working.I remember clearly, as if it's today, seeing the maple tree outside the littleapartment, moving in the wind against a street light. But I couldn't move! Ithought, \"Oh, great. Here I am, back in this messed-up body, paralyzed.\" I trulythought that I had been so damaged from this severe infection that I'd beenparalyzed from a stroke.(As it turned out, that was a temporary phenomenon. Today, it is understood thatin prolonged near-death experiences it takes some time to be reconnected to thephysical body. )I then felt a being in the room sent there to test my will to live. It wassomewhat frightening, but perhaps a necessary experience that forced me to usemy willpower to remain here. There was this force that seemed to be pulling meback out. So I would go back out of my body and then return. I had to exercisevolition to remain in the physical body and keep my astral body of light andconscious body integrated with it. And after about half a dozen tries, I nailedit and remained here. I then became fully awake and regained my motor skills.As they say in Britain, I was quite 'gob-smacked'! This experience altered mylife like nothing before, changing everything I had been taught - that there wasno Divine Being or conscious existence after the death of the body. I now knowfrom direct experience this is false. God does exist, as do His Messengers. Forme, nothing would ever be the same. I'd learned that death is not to be feared,that, in fact, there is no death - only a transformation from one state intoanother.As I got up and re-integrated with the world, I remained in this state ofincredible bliss, a rarefied state of higher consciousness where the unboundedquality of cosmic awareness, was still awake in me. Enclosed in a room, I couldbe infinitely aware at the same time. The mystics call this cosmic consciousness- a state I continued to experience some time thereafter.Interestingly, my diseased leg spontaneously healed. I didn't see a doctor orreceive antibiotic medication during the entire episode.21"},{"pageContent":"2 COMING FULL CIRCLEI marked my 18th birthday by learning a structured form of meditation calledTranscendental Meditation or TM. I was hungry for anything that would give me anability to experience higher conscious awareness at will. It appeared that theTM course would be the avenue to take.I quickly realized that without its ceremonial trappings, TM is a simpleprocess. It consists of sitting with a thought mantra or sound in order totranscend conscious, linear thought and move into unbounded awareness.Sitting next to my teacher, we began the technique. What followed seemed bizarreto him, but felt normal to me. I entered complete transcendental consciousness -full Samadhi. So I was there once more - in the state of cosmic awareness. Itwas very beautiful, and the technique worked for me so easily because thechannel was already open, due to my near-death episode the previous March.The teacher looked at me afterward and said, \"^You went there, didn't you?' Isaid, \"Yes.\" He said, \"On the first time?\" And I said, \"Well, I'm not so sureit's the first time, but the first time with you!\"I began thereafter to practice the ability to experience cosmic consciousness atwill. This opened up an even more extraordinary view of the world and of myself.I could now re-connect to the very pure state of Earth, nature, and divinitythat exist untainted by human corruption. I was rediscovering the purity andinnocence of that awareness I had as a young boy, but understanding it morefully.I left the following summer to attend Appalachian State University in Boone,N.C. I selected ASU based purely on its wilderness location in my beloved BlueRidge Mountains, for which I have a deep affinity. I believe this feeling comesfrom a genetic connection based on my Cherokee heritage.I wanted to spend every moment possible out in those mountains, in every kind ofweather, being totally connected like a spirit walker in nature. I was eager topractice my newly acquired meditation skills and to continue having theexperience of connecting with Divinity Thus, at the threshold of my adulthood,I'd gone from growing up in a home with no prayer - not even knowing about it orabout22the experience of communion with God to experiencing cosmic consciousness. I'dfound all of this on my own.The absence of religious upbringing was actually a blessing in disguise. I thinkthere's an inverse relationship between religiosity and spirituality, with onlya few rare exceptions. Having been spared the religiosity, I could simply searchfor the truth, without the baggage of embellished doctrines.What happened that fall was an extraordinary amplification of that near-deathoccurrence about six months earlier. I was on Rich's Mountain, about 5,000 feetabove the town of Boone. At the top, there was a fire tower at the end of agravel road that was closed at its base.One crystal clear afternoon, I decided to go to see the sunset from atop thismountain. I reached the top in time to sit in meditation at sunset.Before starting, I glanced towards the southwest and saw an extraterrestrialvehicle. It was some distance away, but was just like the one I had seen as anine year old. For some reason, my reaction at that moment was, \"It's themagain\" - and I didn't really think much more about it - I simply accepted thefact that they were here. Then the ship winked out, just like the one I'd seenyears before.I then began meditating and had a beautiful, deep experience in unbounded Mind.Afterward, I opened my eyes and it was pitch dark, with the stars all visible.Imagine being at that altitude in the crystal clear dry air, viewing the MilkyWay and countless stars! Standing there, suddenly a thought not my own came tomind: \"Behold what a beautiful universe God has made.\"With that, I went into the exact state of consciousness I had when I died, thatGod consciousness where I was fully awake, at one with the entire creation, andyet present standing on the mountain. It was magnificent.When I began the walk down, I noticed a glow off the edge of the mountain andsensed someone was there. Suddenly, on my right, an extraterrestrial biologicallife form appeared and touched my shoulder so firmly that it was like a strongfinger touching me. I looked down and saw the imprint on my jacket: every hairon my head stood on end!Somewhat childishly, my first thought was, \"What does this creature want withme?\" I got down close to the ground (I hate to admit this!)in a fetal position,looking up - and he was looking back. Its gender was male. He was quite peacefuland non-threatening, with beautiful, deer-like eyes.Then I suddenly found myself transported onto the craft. We were just out inspace, sitting. I recall that the craft became completely translucent. It feltlike I was floating in space with nothing around, as if the whole craft was madeof fiber optics, and its shell could disappear. Space was visible all around us.23So I stayed there with these ETs, who were three or four feet tall, all withthose appealing eyes. It appeared that we were there for one purpose; meditatingtogether. They were interested in me because they wanted contact with a humanbeing experiencing cosmic consciousness as we do, participating with them. Atthis point I taught them what that state is like for us. We shared it together -an incredible encounter, entirely different from stories usually circulatedabout extraterrestrial contact.It was a very non-local experience, with time, space, and relativity in a realmunlike what's normal for us. In that state of consciousness seconds, hours, oryears no longer matter, because time and space have been transcended. Thisinfinite eternity is the true nature of the mind, the awake self within all ofus.While with these beings, we co-created a code for humans communicating withthem. This was actually the birth of the CE-5 - Close Encounters of the FifthKind - initiative. We utilized not only sounds and light but also non-localconsciousness and directed, coherent thought to communicate withextraterrestrial beings and their electronic devices. This was October of 1973,during the time of the Yom Kippur war.It was clear to me that the ETs wanted humans to move beyond mutually assureddestruction and into a peaceful civilization that could co-exist with space inharmony. Earth needed to find people to be ambassadors for this objective. Andso, I offered to do this, and to help teach the same to our fellow humans.Nothing more, just that.Then very suddenly I returned to a \"regular\" state of awareness and found myselfback on the gravel road near the fire tower, a little further down the path frommy previous spot, but still at the top of the ridge. I thought, \"Oh, my God, howwonderful.\" The experience of oneness with them had a key message: the consciousmind we are awake with at this moment is the same as that of the Divine Being,and of all beings.Erwin Schrodinger was absolutely correct when he said the total number of mindsin the universe is one. There is one conscious mind, and we are It. So, thereare only one people in the universe, and we are they. No 'alien' or human; justan unbroken, perfect, seamless conscious life in the universe, and we are all apart of it.I'm reminded of a saying from the Sufi tradition: \"Thinkest thyself a puny formwhen within thee the universe is folded?\" It's a rhetorical question. We're notjust this puny form. The entirety of the universe is folded within us. Andthat's really what I experienced with the ETs.They know that the only chance for peace on Earth -- never mind the cosmos -- isfor humans to understand there's no real difference amongst us. It doesn'tmatter24how we look- consider the variety in physical appearances that exists on Earthalone! What really matters is that within us lives the same singular light ofconsciousness, infinite, eternal and always present, whether we're open to it ornot at any given moment in time. It is the basis of our relationship with eachother and with the universe. This is enduring and eternal -- and that is what weexperienced in its absolute, purest form. It was beyond beautiful. And there wasabsolutely nothing frightening about it.It didn't matter that I was only 18. They didn't care about such things as age,race, family of origin, or wealth. They cared about the fact that I waspure-hearted enough to see the truth clearly and unattached to the materialityof this world. I could discern the universal aspect of teachings in variouscultures that humans have learned through the ages, because truth is one and thesame in any language. What we created together that day proved that humans canbe, each of us, connected to each other and to the unbounded awareness of theuniverse, but also to these other civilizations, if we simply understand thefact that we're awake. If you are awake, reading this or hearing this right now,the awake-ness whereby you're hearing it is a singularity. And it isn't divided.We divide it into our own egos and intellect, but in reality, the light ofawareness is the same in every being, in every star. And the entire cosmos issuffused in this same light of Being. There is this great Sun of awarenessreflecting and refracting in everyone, yet still singular. So, if you return tothat and if you experience it, none of these life forms seem far away orunusual-or alien - because they really are not.So, it was on this occasion the CSETI concept of one universe, one people wasconceived. There is really one people in the universe, and we are they. There isa single conscious being shining in all of us. It can never be divided, nomatter how much we try. We may want to divide it, but it's always one. It'salways a singularity, always perfect. The extraterrestrial beings that are hereunderstand this, because they cannot travel through interstellar space withoutunderstanding non-locality. And understanding non-locality, necessitates a highlevel of knowledge and enlightenment.In a real sense, then, the heart of compassion and the foundation of peace isfound in the reality that we are all one. Without that experience,intellectualism is all that's left - and it never lasts. So, I came to realizeat a rather young age that the world's problems are essentially spiritual,therefore the solutions must be spiritual as well. And so it has turned out tobe.I found myself back on the mountain under the beautiful, starry sky, only toexperience another strange phenomenon. I was perhaps 100 yards further down thegravel road. As I started down the mountain, I found that with each step, I wasin a state of near- weightlessness, as if walking on the moon!25My steps were actually leaps of 20 to 30 feet at once! It was more like floatingthan walking. There was a strange, magnetic, anti-gravitational effect aroundme, making me lighter. It wasn't a product of my imagination; my physical bodywas light.I was just happy as a lark! Here I was, fresh from this experience on an ETV,and now bounding down the mountain, traveling in \"boing, boing, boing\" leapsacross impossible distances with each step. It was incredibly blissful. As I gotcloser to town, the phenomenon faded, and my weight returned to normal.Upon reaching the little town of Boone, it looked so deserted I thought therehad been a nuclear war! I thought it was about 9 or 10 o'clock at night-everything should have been open. Remember, it's a little college town up inthe North Carolina mountains. I thought to myself, \"What in the world is goingon? I wonder if the Yom Kippur War got out of control and there was athermonuclear war and I'm the last to know?\" A check of the time told me, it wasnearly 1:00 A.M! My cosmic experience had lasted three or four hours!After this amazing evening, I decided to practice all I had learned, taught andshared with the extraterrestrials. Every night before going to sleep, I wouldlie down and put myself in a meditative state. I would enter unboundedAwareness, then expand the sense of conscious mind around me, filling the room,knowing that it was omnipresent. On the wings of that omnipresent sense ofAwareness, I would expand upwards into space, seeing the stars and space, filledwith the sense that it was awake. And I was one with that awake-ness, whichplaced me out there, in space.Then I would send a thought like a beacon to the extraterrestrial beings, toannounce my presence. In a somewhat childlike way, I'd say, \"I don't know if youremember me, but my name is Steve. And here I am - let me show you where I am.\"So, I would do the protocol we developed for the CE-5 initiative:In this higher state of consciousness I would turn it around, and instead ofseeing outward into the vastness of space, look back - and show the ETs mylocation on earth.I would show them the Milky Way Galaxy and then zoom in from there to our SolarSystem, with the sun and the Earth. Then I would zoom to the Earth and NorthAmerica, further in to the eastern United States and the Appalachian Mountains.Then I would zoom in to show them my location in Boone, North Carolina; then tomy exact spot in that building. And with that, I would fall asleep.For months my experiences were really quite extraordinary. From October '73onwards, there began an unprecedented wave of UFO sightings in those mountains.I did this as a way of beta-testing the system, to see if what we had co-createdand agreed upon on the ship would actually work. Well, it did. There werenewspaper26reports of forest rangers seeing these huge ships hovering over the mountains,down in Shining Rock Wilderness to the south, and over in the Linville Gorgearea. . . here, there, and everywhere!I continued to do this until one day, in the local paper, a story appeared abouta guy driving nearby on a road outside Morganton, North Carolina. As ETVstravel, it was only seconds away from me. This boy, who looked a lot like me,was driving on that road, and the car suddenly stopped. There was a shiphovering by the road, with an ET at the boy's window! The driver was completelyfreaked out.I saw this as an indirect way for the ETs to say, \"You know, we're gettingthis.\" So I thought to myself, \"Well I'm playing around with fire, here. Ithink, until I figure out what I'm supposed to do with this, this is enough.\"I didn't tell anyone about this episode for a very long time. However, peopleneed to understand why I gave up an established medical career - and thequarter-million dollars per year that came with it - to make known what I knowto be true. Certainly not because s \"only a theory it’\"!While still in this state, asleep, I continued to have some kind of ongoingdialogue with these extraterrestrial beings. My roommate told me quite some timelater, that for a number of months he would awaken late at night, and would hearme speaking quietly in my sleep.He said, \"You were speaking, but with a language not of this world.\" And Ithought, \"Oh, my God. Somehow, I was in a state of consciousness where I couldconnect to the language used by the ETs. And he was hearing that very clearly.He said, \"Absolutely, it was not an Earth language.\"After this, I pretty much decided that, until I had a specific reason to utilizethese protocols I experienced with the ETs, it would be wiser to be just quietlyaware of the ability, but keep it to myself.In 1974, I left the traditional college at Boone to enter teacher training atMaharishi International University in Iowa. My experiences during the trainingthere were really quite extraordinary, in part because I remained independent interms of the institutional, dogmatic aspects of the group. However, there was anenormous amount of profound knowledge being discussed.I immersed myself in the study of the Vedas and the Sanskrit language. I wasenormously impressed with the amount of knowledge in the Vedas - how theexperience of consciousness and universal awareness was articulated. Thisexperience enabled me to have a time and place to be completely dedicated to thedevelopment of higher states of consciousness.One of the most profound things I absorbed was the unfolding of the cosmology.This came not so much from didactic learning as from direct experience, whichincluded the astral or causal thought realms and the realms of light.27Once one understands the structure of creation and begins to experience it indetail, it becomes very understandable how people can have dreams of the future,alter their physical body to levitate, or to de-materialize and re-appear inanother place. All the things you've heard about in what are consideredmythological stories or so-called miracles become more comprehensible. They arealso completely attainable by every single conscious human being. All beingswill one day be capable of experiencing these things. The ability is ourbirthright- not just humans, but every conscious being in the universe. We areall children of God and all of these gifts and states exist within each of us.That year, I began to have experiences that brought the infinite Being into thisworld. I could see a rock and know that it also contains pure awareness. Withinthe rock is the energy and the frequency of a light form, an astral form thatgives it structure and its crystalline matrix form. And within that is the ideaof it, and within the idea is the primal thought that created all things. Andwithin that is pure, quiet conscious mind. In fact, the totality of everythingis nothing but pure conscious awareness, phasing, resonating and playing indifferent forms and in different ways.Much of the knowledge that goes with this has to be realized from experience.The good news is that everyone, at some time in their life, has experienced thattype of integration and oneness. They just have to remember it. My intention isto try to describe it in a way that will help you remember. If I couldaccomplish this from my personal background- having grown up with a totalabsence of exposure to the world of spirituality, then anyone can!As all of this began to unfold, I dedicated myself for a number of years toteaching meditation and higher states of consciousness. During those years, Itook an advanced course in the Catskills, in New York. On that retreat, I fastedand spent several hours a day in meditation, in a really beautiful, quiet state.I began to awaken to an ability I'd had since childhood -- but then onlybeginning to emerge -- of being able to see things within consciousness thatwere not visible to the naked eye. Walking down a corridor, I would try to seewhat was around the corner. Almost every time, I would see what was there or whowas coming. And I wasn't trying to guess until I got it right. It was likestaying in a steady state of consciousness and actually seeing it.Then I would attempt to see things happening at a distant point on Earth or at adistant point in time -- the next day or the next week. I practiced this a greatdeal. It became routine for me to be able to go to sleep and see a distant placeor event, and know what was going to happen the next day.Now, this is no mystery, if you understand the omnipresent nature ofconsciousness.28Because it is omnipresent, it is beyond the restrictions of time or space, whichmeans that you can break those bonds through entering this state of awareness.And when you do, you will find yourself able to see things one isn't \"supposedto be\" able to see. Space and time are obliterated, and you are free to reallysee.One day during this retreat I wondered about some of the so-called siddhis (orspiritual powers) described in the Vedas.I thought it would be interesting to test the limits of this for the physicalbody. I began to think about the abilities we have- if we are all consciousnessand our bodies are actually filled with the light of awareness. What might wereally achieve? Well, one day I was in an enormously happy, joyful, peacefulstate. I was out walking on a magnificent, clear spring day. Being so affectedby Earth and nature, the moment was right for what followed.As I was walking in the field behind the manor where we were staying, Ispontaneously -- without effort or forethought -- levitated. It was reminiscentof that prolonged experience of bounding down the mountainside after my ETencounter in October of '73. This time I just lifted vertically, maybe two orthree feet above the ground.Instead of walking to my destination, I glided there in an upright, verticallevitation experience. And then at the moment my intellect kicked in and Iexclaimed, \"My God, look what's happening. How can I be doing this?\", I settleddown to Earth. It was halted by my own intellect and ego!One of the many lessons I learned from this is that there's a certain grace,along with faith, needed for such extraordinary experiences. I don't meanreligious faith per se, but the certainty of, or knowing the capacity latentwithin. It is beyond self, ego, and intellect. If we can give ourselves freelyto it, incredible things can be accomplished. And if it fails to flow, it'sbecause we are stopping it. Ultimately, it is recognizing and embracing thepower of God within each of us.After this experience, it became increasingly clear that we have within us anycapability, and that anyone can acquire and develop them. We're coming into anera where such things will become routine and accepted as \"the norm.\"There is sometimes a tendency by people involved in various spiritual andreligious groups to put people who have this level of experience or knowledge ona pedestal, as if it's unattainably unique. It's not, and that's very importantto understand. It is, in fact, a disservice to the nature and potential ofhumanity to idolize something that should be understood as the birthright ofeveryone.In 1975, I went with some friends to Isola, France, up in the Maritime Alps, tobecome instructors of meditation. While on this particular retreat, I had anumber of experiences with higher states of consciousness, what might be calledunity consciousness and God consciousness.29One day, remembering what had happened two years earlier in the North Carolinamountains, I wondered if that same extraordinary experience could be repeated.So in the hotel room, I went through the protocol we'd created in 1973 on thatspacecraft.I then went into the state of unbounded consciousness, and then expandedawareness off the mountain, around the Alps, into space, and out into our SolarSystem. Seeing the vastness of space, I said to these craft and the ETs onboard, \"My name is Steve. I don't know if you remember me, but we met a coupleyears ago, and now here I am up in the French Maritime Alps, in Isola.\"And so I showed them the beautiful spiral galaxy, the Milky Way, our star systemwith the sun and its planets, and the Earth. And then I zoomed in to Europe, tothe Maritime Alps of France. I showed them our location in the hotel complex andsaid, \"If you can come visit, please do.\" This occurred in an unbroken flow ofconsciousness for about 20 minutes.Later, after lunch, some friends and I decided to go for a walk in the mountainsnear the hotel. It was about 1:00 in the afternoon. I looked up in the crystalclear, Alpine sky to see a beautiful, huge tetrahedral- shaped ship, shining inthe sun. It was clear and fully materialized, and drawing down towards us,silently.A good friend in the group who knew of my experiences with extra- terrestrialvehicles gasped, \"My God, Steve, did you call them here?\" And she just cameunglued. \"Oh, my God, I can't believe it.\" And I replied, \"Yeah, I did. I didthis protocol that I told you about.\" She asked, \"My God, why didn't you warnme?!\"At the point this anxiety was shown by some of the group, the ETV stoppedapproaching us, hovered, and then backed off silently. Then this huge craft justcompletely \"de-materialized,\" disappeared out of our space-time. I turned to herand smiled, \"Well, I guess the protocol does work.\" And she says, \"My God, nexttime, let me know. Warn me before you're going to do it!\" But I was laughinghysterically!This taught me that, in fact, we could contact the ETs and this could beexperienced by others. It was the first time since I was nine years old that Ihad actually seen one of these ET craft in the company of other people. In thiscase, it was a true CE-5, where a human invited the craft and they came,witnessed by others. Clearly, the protocols worked. I began to feel that maybethis should be taught to people at some point, because everyone should learnthat this is possible.But as time passed, I began to question it again. When something thisextraordinary happens, doubts always creep in! After a while, I was living backin the mountains of North Carolina, outside of Blowing Rock, with a friend whohad been on the training course. We had become teachers of meditation together.One day in late fall 1977 I decided to test the protocol again. That night I satup in bed and meditated.30I went into the expanded state of consciousness, felt it expanding into space,saw the fullness and infinity of space being filled with the light of awareness,and in that light I saw these extraterrestrial people and said, again, \"My nameis Steve.\"But, thinking so much time had passed that maybe they didn't remember, I said,\"Well, my name is Steve Greer and I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina onJune 28, 1955.\" I then gave them an entire brief biography! I showed themCharlotte, and how to get to my location. From space, they could go toCharlotte, then up to the North Carolina mountains, about 100 miles away. Afterfollowing this technique in a stream of consciousness, I fell asleep.Suddenly, I awakened in the wee hours of the morning between 1 and 4 a.m. Andhere was this beautiful blue-white craft outside the window and about 30 feetabove the house. And the consciousness of the occupant was being projected rightinto the room I was in! It was very palpable.We were out in the middle of nowhere, totally surrounded by mountains andmeadows and silence. And here was this ship silently hovering right outside mywindow! Suddenly my housemate woke up in his bedroom; jumped up, rushed into myroom and exclaimed, \"Do you see that?\" I said, \"Yes,\" kind of sheepishly, like,\"Uh-oh.\" And he says, \"My God, there's a space ship right outside our window.\" Isaid, \"Yeah, I know. I kind of invited them.\"He became really unhinged and said, \"Damn it, don't ever do that without tellingme! You scared the hell out of me!\" He could feel, also, that there was anintelligent being, de-materialized, but like a projection of awareness, from theship inside the room.We went into the living room, and the ship followed us around to that side ofthe house, to the big picture window overlooking Grandfather Mountain. By then,I think they sensed my friend's fear, and with that, the ship backed off, wentout over the valley, and swoosh, streaked away - off into space over Grandfathermountain.The very next day, we heard on radio and in news reports that two space shipswere found on the radar at Douglas Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina. Theywere pursued by a police helicopter called Snoopy. I was stunned to hear thethat area of the city where the sightings were centered was where I was born andgrew up - the spot I'd shown them in my vectoring through consciousness.One of the craft apparently got very close to the police helicopter, and also toan Eastern Airlines jet. This was all recorded by the air traffic control tower,and it confirmed the CE-5.Years later, a man who had acquired the FAA audio tape of that event shared thetape with me. (We have it in the CSETI archives.) In the transcript, one of the31craft just vanished, and the other one was seen and tracked going off towardsthe northwest: the mountains where I was located. And, in fact, it then appearedoutside my window.So, that was an interesting early CE-5 that not only had another witness - myhapless housemate - but also was tracked on radar, observed by commercialairline pilots, and chased by a police helicopter.Frankly, I was stunned and a bit unnerved by the precision of the event. Ithought, \"Wow. This is serious! I really shouldn't do this anymore until Iformalize a program for it.\" And, in fact, I didn't do it again- from 1977 to1990- when I formed the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence,or CSETI.32"},{"pageContent":"3 OUT OF THE SHADOWSThose youthful experiences made me understand something important about thenature of advanced ET civilizations: they have selected non-hostility as anatural evolutionary step. In other words, their high level of consciousness isincompatible with divisiveness or conflict. Otherwise, with the incredibletechnology at their command, they would have long since destroyed one another.Without the realization of oneness, differences are perceived as a cause foralarm, fear, hostility and violence. The history of human experience over themillennia is proof...One has only to look at the state of humanity today. Globally, hostility andmistrust abound among divergent religions, ethnic groups, and nations, bringingwar and untold suffering in its wake. The consciousness of difference anddivision must be rejected, or there can be no peace.Humanity now stands at a crossroad; we will either continue to destroy the Earthand its inhabitants through ignorance, warfare and conflict, or we'll reach astate of spiritual enlightenment and social maturity from which we acknowledgeour inherent oneness. If not, then powerful technologies will remain in thehands of people who are submerged in ignorance, superstition, and conflict.But, those conditions cannot exist alongside the state of oneness that is thetrue wellspring of compassion. As the Buddha said, you can not do violence toanother when you realize oneness.There are those who might go through what I've described in my ET encounters,and react in stark terror, even with the same stimuli: a ship by the window; asighting on the mountain. But my near-death experience allowed me to approachthese things without fear. There is no death; why be afraid?It is critical to understand that an enormous and sophisticated disinformationcampaign exists around the whole extraterrestrial question- at least 90 percentof the information and images portrayed to the public are selected to evoke fear- followed by hatred of all things alien. Movies, TV shows, and books about thesubject prove this point:33if one is to believe that rubbish, you would think that every other person inAmerica is being snatched from their homes at midnight and tortured! It simplyisn't true. But fear and horror sells, and the usual suspects benefit from aterrified, misinformed populace.We know that clandestine paramilitary operations exist, controlled by a shadowygroup staging simulated UFO/ETV events. This is not speculation: we haveinterviewed many independent corroborating military people who have participatedon the teams that have deliberately \"abducted\" people to create the illusion ofreal extraterrestrial encounters.In the 'UFO industry' there is the multi-million-dollar abduction subculture,funded by powerful, wealthy interests (including certain European royal familiesalong with industrial scions in the United States). Stories publicized are verydeliberately selected. If someone comes to one of the abduction support groupsand researchers with the account I've shared, they will be shown the door. Theyonly want to select the terrifying stories - those from people who have hadsimulated encounters, foisted on them by a military effort that is trying tocreate psychological propaganda. This will support future Star Wars expendituresdown the road by sowing the seeds of division between humans andextraterrestrial people.It is part of a well thought-out plan to divide one group against another. Andin order to do this, a threat must be demonstrated, and the supposed \"enemy\"demonized. So most of the UFO/ET information put out is designed bycounter-intelligence, PSYOPS and disinformation people for a specific, intendedeffect.The first is simply to discredit the subject, because most of their storiesdon't hold up under scrutiny. The second, in my opinion, is to create afoundation of fear upon which to build the edifice of Star Wars. And no less afigure than Werner von Braun told a member of our team, Carol Rosin, that, infact, this was exactly what was going on: that weapons will be based in space -hence, the need to create a psychological nexus where people will fear allthings alien. Then, down the road (when the folks enjoying themulti-trillion-dollar bonanza of current industrial and military operationsdecide the deception has gone on long enough), they can declare the world needsto unite around 'kicking alien butt' (as quoted from the movie, \"IndependenceDay\").Keep in mind that the Cold War and all the things going on today will pale incomparison to the financial benefit to be gained by stampeding the masses into afalse idea of a threat from outer space that must be resisted. Instead ofextracting unlimited dollars for the military operations from the United Statesand the West, the imagined 'threat' will produce enough xenophobia to insure a\"blank check\", or steady flow of government dollars, in the name of preservingsafety and world peace. Sound familiar?34This assessment comes from having interviewed numerous military people insidethe organizations dealing with this. I've been told point blank that this hasbeen an ongoing agenda since at least the 1950's. These operations have usedsomething called \"alien reproduction vehicles,\" manufactured by a consortium ofcompanies that include Lockheed Martin, Northrup, SAIC, E Systems, EG&G andMitre Corporation (among others). These are man-made anti-gravity devices thatwe've been using since at least the '50s, along with other powerful electronicweapons systems and \"programmed life forms\" or PLFs. These are biological,artificial life forms being produced to look a lot like these so-called \"greys\"-- that are not from outer space. They're manufactured in a few facilities, oneof them located in the four corners area near Dulce, New Mexico.This is a concerted effort to create a false \"alien threat.\" If someone comesforward with a dissimilar story, they're blacklisted from lectures andsubsequently unable to get their story out to the public or the media in bookform or through any other significant channel. But those who create terrifyingmessages - akin to the movie \"Independence Day\", or certain abduction books, -receive high dollar advances along with big publishing deals and film contracts.This is assuredly by design.The power elite want those alarming stories seeded into the mass consciousness,and for the truth to be buried. I have met with people who are funding abductioncults in the United States and Europe. Aside from having interviewed militarypeople who've perpetrated these pseudo-abductions, I've personally been told byno less a figure than the reigning member of a European royal family that hehelps fund these efforts. He reasons that the frightening stories need to be outthere, to make the world aware that these \"evil aliens\" exist and must befought.He went so far as to say that, in fact, every major Earthly problem since Adamand Eve is attributable to the machinations of these demonic extraterrestrials.He genuinely believes this! And he is also the chief funder of Opus Dei, whichis the sensitive right-wing group at the Vatican with an internal secret celloperating these programs. Additionally, I was told that his reason forterminating support for a prominent author in this field (who will remainunnamed here), is that his stories weren't sufficiently alarming. He wasportraying interaction between humans and ETs too positively - the sponsor onlywanted the most terrifying tales put out to the public!A prominent leader of one of these abduction groups told me point blank that ifsomeone attends their meetings whose experiences don't fit the mode of militaryabductions (which are harrowing), they'll kick them out. So, it's aself-selecting, fraudulent process.This well-oiled machine marches out false, contrived \"alien encounters\".35These are then funneled to specific researchers, who then get channeled intospecific movie, documentary, and/or book deals. And it's all lucrative. It isbeing done specifically to generate propaganda designed to marshal the massesagainst this supposed threat from outer space, thereby perpetuating andaugmenting the hoax already thriving.Within the Shadow Government is a hard-core group of eschatologists: peopleobsessed with the end of the world who would like to see it go out in one bigeco-alien cataclysm, to hasten the return of Christ! This is their agenda: Theymaintain that the world has to be in the most dire of conditions for the SecondComing to occur, and they hope to make circumstances ripe for that goal. It isjust plain madness. With this degree of hyper-religiosity, fanaticism, andcultish secrecy combined with enormous power, the results are predictablyoutrageous.A few years ago I attended a meeting in New York with Mrs. Boutros-Ghali, thewife of the Secretary General, and some of the \"New York 100\" crowd. A womanapproached me to say, \"Well, I'll have you know I've read 26 books about UFOsand abductions,\". I said, \"Well, with all due respect, that means that you'veincorporated into your awareness 26 times more disinformation and rubbish thansomeone who's only read one book.\" I'm not quite sure I endeared myself to her,but it is the truth.I have shared my insight with some very senior military personnel as well aspeople like Mrs. Boutros-Ghali and others. Their first response isn't that itcan't be true, but they're just horrified that it may be.Often people ask whether the road that the human race is on is atypical ortypical of what other planets have gone through. I think there's a whole rangeof capabilities and experiences that happen with different people. I understandthat there are some extraterrestrial civilizations that have never had conflictand warfare. And there are others that have, perhaps, passed this way, learnedthe lessons, and evolved to a peaceful world.The more a civilization moves away from spirituality, the more violent itbecomes. Here, I mean genuine spirituality rather than religiosity. What nowpasses for \"religion,\" for the most part, is a man-made contrivance - acorruption of it's original intent.If a civilization separates from its intrinsic spirituality while at the sametime developing enormous means of intellect and technology, conflict isinevitable. Earth, is now trying to sort out that dynamic. And we haven't done aterribly good job of it so far.It is fair to say that ETs would be aware of the risks and the pitfalls of thistumultuous transition we're in today - which I liken to humanity as an organismgoing from childhood to maturity - and we're in this prolonged adolescent phase.36We are chaotic and rebellious and trying to find our footing, but we are not yetmature. And unfortunately, some of us are like adolescent boys who've gottenhold of some hand grenades and are pulling the pins out.That being the case, if you look at humanity and the state of the world todaydispassionately, and look through the eyes of an extraterrestrial civilization,you know that there is cause for concern. For this reason, actions taken by ETsthat have contained some of our efforts and clipped our wings as we've tried toweaponize space, are understandable (We know this has happened from testimony bynumerous corroborative Disclosure Project witnesses).Those actions could be considered an act of hostility... However I view itinstead as an enlightened act of compassion. They know that we could be a threatnot only to ourselves but also to other worlds. Alas, our technology has marchedahead of our spiritual and social evolution, making us, frankly, a dangerouspeople.The time we live in is very pregnant, but growing short. We haven't reallychanged directions enough to avoid some very serious consequences that are anatural outgrowth of our retrograde behavior. If you combine extraordinarytechnologies with a predisposition to vilify anything we don't understand orcontrol, a very dangerous situation results.So, these extraterrestrial civilizations are monitoring Earth very closely. Ihave no doubt that this is why many of our military witnesses have recountedthese extraterrestrial vehicles monitoring intercontinental ballistic missilesilos, weapons storage facilities, weapon plants, space launches and ICBMlaunches. They want to be very clear that these weapons must not be used andthat they're watching our behavior. If we were to get completely out of control,there would be an intervention to stop a worst-case scenario from unfolding.We're reaching the point where the Earth will have to end the burden we'veplaced on her, if we don't lift the burden ourselves. We have another couple ofgenerations to get it right; I would be surprised if we could go 50 more yearson the path we're on right now.I was approached by a number of the people who run the super- secret projectsrelated to UFOs and advanced energy systems in 1991. They had read one of myearly papers about the concept of oneness and our civilization and theexperience of cosmic awareness and cosmic people. They emphasized the importanceof sharing this information with their group. These were people who called mefrom the CIA, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and similar operations. EverythingI've written was primarily intended for this group.The masses of people simply want to live their lives peacefully. They don't careabout ripping each others throats out. There is only a very small minority ofhumans who are psychotically violent and controlling. The fires of hatred andconflict, that keep getting ignited, have been lit deliberately because it'sbenefiting this violent group.37People within the general population have a strong need to know about thisinformation. They have a need to know, a right to know and a responsibility toact, because they can restrain the worst abuses of a covert group like this ifthey exert their will. But the entrenchment and the ferocity of some elementswithin this dangerous group are such that a spiritual perspective needs to beelucidated.This is why, when I sit down and write something, until now, it has been writtenwith the primary audience being those people who most need to hear it. Mostpeople on Earth would love to simply live together peacefully, enjoy theirdiversity in cultures, have these technologies, and evolve and go on and raisetheir children and send them to college and have a nice life.It's not like there's 99 percent of the world's population who's in favor ofgoing hell bent over Niagara Falls without a barrel. There are a relativelysmall number of people who have a perspective that is retrograde. They arelooking in their rear view mirror and mistaking it for the future. So our taskhas been to turn their heads and look forward.It is important that we view these very powerful industrial, military andreligious interests as educable.We have frittered away the last 50 years while the Earth was speaking to us, thepeople of the Earth were cautioning us, the mountains were weeping, the polarice caps were melting and the ETs have been warning us. And we've been heedlessfor 50 years. We need to listen and we need to act - now.The people running these covert projects are conscious beings who are educableand can learn and can grow and can get this information and change theirparadigm before it's too late. In our own meditation and prayers we should askfor transformation and enlightenment for these people, rather than creatingenmity and tension.38"},{"pageContent":"4 MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVENI went to live in Israel in January of 1978, initially just to visit for aboutten days. I ended up staying for three years, working at the world headquartersof the Baha'i religion on Mount Carmel in Haifa. It was a wonderful andinteresting experience being at some very sacred places. In all my travelsthroughout that area, I could feel the presence of the spiritual teachers thathave come to this small area. And at the same time, I sensed that every rock issoaked in the blood of conflict.It is a very strange juxtaposition of extremes — the manifestation of these veryexalted prophets such as Christ or Moses or Abraham or Mohammed or Baha'u'l-lahor the Bab. At the same time there's this incredibly primitive enmity andfanaticism. But then, the prophets always come at the darkest time and to thedarkest place.For many years I've been able to go to sleep at night and see something thatwill happen the next day or the next month or at some point in the future. Thisstarted happening more and more intensely the more I experienced these higherstates of consciousness. In the winter of 1978, I was living in an apartment onMount Carmel, overlooking the Mediterranean. One night, I had a dream: I wassuddenly in a space that was defined but didn't have walls, and it was verylight. Near where I was living were the remains of a nobleman who had been headof the Baha'i Faith named Abdu'1-Baha. He was known as a very gentle, wise,sweet, loving figure who was greatly enlightened in the perfect state of man. Heappeared to me in this dream and introduced me to a woman and said, \"This is whowe wish for you to marry\" He then told me many details about her and said,\"She'll come from far away and visit here and then leave, but you'll be marriedhere in Israel. She'll be older than you, but that won't be a problem.\" And thenthis woman and I were introduced, and I could see exactly who it was and how shewas dressed.This happened every night for four or five nights in a row. Now, here I am, 22years old, and no more interested in being married than the man in the moon! Butone thing about spiritual guidance: it doesn't do you any good if you don't takeit.39So, I said, \"Well, I guess I should be looking to find this person.\"A month or two later, I was in the gardens where Abdu'l-Baha is buried, on MountCarmel at his shrine. In through the gate walked Emily. I was delighted to seethat she was the person from my dream. But you don't go up to a completestranger and say, \"Hello, I've had a dream with you and we're supposed to bemarried!\" We met and talked for maybe an hour and a half; it was like we'dalways known each other. But I still didn't mention my dream.She was there for a convention, and the very last day she was there, I saw heragain, briefly. They were about ready to close the gates to these beautifulgardens and to the shrines, and Emily was going to go there and say someprayers. I said, \"You'd better hurry, because they're closing soon.\" So, shewent and that was the last time I saw her on that trip.Later, I went to the shrine and prayed and said to God, \"If this is really whoYou wish for me to marry, she's going to have to approach me, with me nevertelling her the dream or trying to contact her again.\"Well, Emily was going to meet her mother in London for a vacation. When she gotthere, she had a strange compulsion to try to write me, but she didn't even knowmy last name! She only knew my name is Steve. Someone that she was travelingwith happened to know my last name, and so she was able to get the letter to me,through the headquarters of the Baha'i religion there in Israel.Emily wrote me a letter saying how much she enjoyed meeting me, etc. That waswhat I'd been waiting for. I wrote a first letter to her that was just normaland friendly. In the second letter, I recounted the whole story of how we hadbeen introduced and what Abdu'l-Baha said in the dream. She wrote me back andsaid, \"Well, if this is the divine will, this is what we'll do.\"We corresponded for a whole year. In June of 1979, Emily packed up all herthings. We met in the Seattle airport and went to Alaska for a ten- daycourtship and then decided, yes, we would be married. And in August of 1979, wewere married on Mt. Carmel in Israel! This year (2006) is our 27th anniversary.So some marriages really are made in heaven!\"I tell people this story because many people are given guidance that they don'ttake, because it doesn't appear to make sense. But if it is right, it doesn'thave to make intellectual sense all the time. We've had splendid times, awonderful marriage and four beautiful children. We've done all these things thatyou're going to read about, and I love her now more than ever!Emily picked out a beautiful silk sari with gold thread to wear at our wedding.She didn't know that was exactly what I saw when I was introduced to her in thelucid dream state by Abdu'l-Baha. When I saw it, I said, \"This is exactly it.\"Our first daughter was born on Mount Carmel in Israel, and we brought40her home on our one-year anniversary, so we named her Carmel.After our first child was born, we came back to the United States, and I wentinto medical school. I went into emergency medicine because I found it not onlyvery challenging, but it's where I could apply the science and the technology ofmodern medicine in its highest form. During that time, I was involved in runningprograms dealing with meditation and holistic health. We formed the ShambhalaInstitute and offered programs on holistic health and healing.For many years, I raised our four children with Emily, was chairman of emergencymedicine and worked in an emergency department, and was founder of CSETI and theDisclosure Project. Life was quite a three-ring circus!41"},{"pageContent":"5 FORGIVENESS AND FAITHOne of the great lessons I learned as a teenager was forgiveness. I think it'sso important that if people contemplate the sort of situation the world is in ona macro-scale, that it really comes down to a very personal matter: Themicrocosm of our own lives is recapitulated through society, and we're alloperating as a universal resonator. I found the divine and sacred exists and itis real and it is made manifest through lovingness and forgiveness.So the very first thing that I did was to forgive my parents for actions duringour childhood. You don't forget it, but you can forgive. And this frees up anenormous amount of inner peace and energy because you have let go of thenegative. The act of forgiveness and the act of love is really one of thehighest expressions of spiritual realization.And so what I found is forgiveness and love require a genuine selflessness - onewhere you go beyond yourself. As I looked around the world as a teenager, I sawthat most of the problems in the world were because of selfishness. There's awonderful saying attributed to Abdu'l-Baha that says, \"Where there is love,nothing is too much trouble and there is always time.\" I really believe that.This is part of what we're on planet Earth to learn.I had to create my own spirituality from nothing. This is the blank slatephenomenon: With my near-death experience, I didn't go to the pearly gates wherethere was this angry old man with a beard, throwing down bolts of lightning atpeople and judging you and throwing you by your lying sinful forelock into hell.As I mentioned, one of the first challenges I had was to forgive the peopleclosest to me. People have to learn to forgive. This is why, even though I'llspeak with great force about the need to change the path we're on, it's not thatI'm wanting to do this by taking a pound of flesh in a vengeful way from thosewho have gotten us into this mess. It's that they should be educated and, ifnecessary restrained.But even those actions are done out of love and out of a sense of what needs tohappen. And it must be done with forgiveness. I continue to practice that now.42Being here on this planet, to me, is not about trying to pretend like you'reperfect. There's a saying that's attributed to a German writer: \"those who wouldpretend to be angels are destined to behave as beasts.\"The scariest cultists ever are the ones who set themselves on a dais. It'sbetter to be who you are and be real and be human even while you begin to bringinto this world those attributes that are spiritual and divine. But you don'thave to be perfect to do that.There is no one perfect on Planet Earth, unless that being is an Avatar- that isone of the high prophets or a Manifestation of the Godhead. And there are noneof them living on the Earth today and haven't been for over 100 years, and therewon't be for another 1,000 years.The major prophets or the Manifestations of God are very rare. And they'reactually a different species. They have a station that is beyond that of thecapacity of even a fully enlightened human. In other words, you could evolve tothe highest level of capacity as a human and never reach that station. It isanother lineage, another level. And that's how important those figures are andhow powerful, but also how unique. And that's why I say it's one of the worstthings ever for someone to claim to be that when they're not. The most we can dois to reflect the light from that Godhead.We are all relatively imperfect, and we're here to manifest degrees ofperfection. And beyond that, nothing else should be claimed. And those who claimbeyond that are frauds. Period. I don't care who they are. Only by being who weare and knowing where we are, can we evolve.The South is so crazy - love every minute of it and it suits me just fine! WhenI was growing up back in the late '50s and '60s, it was really the Old South,still. There were wonderful black women that I knew, and they would come up tome and say, \"Oh, you're an old soul.\" They'd look at me and they'd say thingsabout my future. These were very unpretentious, salt of the Earth, wonderfulbeings.You meet people like that all over the world, and you won't meet many of them intemples or in cathedrals or in ashrams, but you will meet them in other places.As a child, I had things affirmed to me from some of these wise and sagaciouspeople. This happened from the time I was four or five years of age on. I wasnot drawn towards the trappings and formality of spirituality that gets subsumedinto the world of priests and the hierarchy or gurus or ashrams, but was moreattracted to that genuine spirituality you find in honest, direct, clear, simplespirituality. Because that's where I stayed, it enabled me to open up my heartand do things such as acts of forgiveness and acts of love that really wereoutside of what my upbringing should have allowed.The message here is: you can transcend your own limitations, if you let yourselfgo there.43You must exercise your free will to create your own reality. As I look back onit, that was the big lesson of the first 20 years of my life. The specificexperiences that I had were in a sense wonderful, and I was blessed to have themeven though they happened in the crucible of much difficulty and suffering. It'seasy to talk about it, but going through it was not easy. Life on earth is notnecessarily easy. There are perfections and imperfections here, and our task isto manifest as many of these good qualities and attributes and perfections as wecan.I had to re-create my life- physically. I had been so sick growing up. I had toreform my body, re-form my mind, reform my spirit, re-form my heart. It was likea Shamanic process. And the way that happened was not only through the exerciseof will but also through an ability to transcend my own limitations.You can call this faith- not the faith that most religious people think such ascertain beliefs and dogmas. To me true faith is a knowingness and a certainty ofthings not yet seen and not yet fully known. And yet in your heart and spirit acertainty exists that it can be. I found the ability to actualize and manifestthrough faith and through vision and saw things happen that were miraculous.I remember, for example, being in college after I had learned meditationtechniques, and I started experimenting with the power of prayer. I lived in adorm and there were these guys who were getting drunk all the time and really ona dangerous path. Every year there were a few of these college kids who ended updrinking and getting killed, driving between Boone and Blowing Rock on atreacherous two-lane road.One afternoon I was sitting in the dorm room meditating. I heard these guys comein, completely drunk and rowdy. So I went into a state of divine awareness, andwithout any irritation or negativity on my part at all -- I wasn't judging -- Ijust went in that state and I saw them. In my mind, I could see them coming downthe hall. And I put this divine light around them, and I asked for theirforgiveness. Then I asked that they wake up to what they were doing and thatthey stop harming themselves in this way. About five minutes later, there was aknock on the door. And there they were, looking completely sober, asking forforgiveness- through me to something greater. It was a transformative event forthem, and I never saw them drunk again!That same year, I found that the same thing happens with animals that there wasthis ability to connect with what people in the East would call the devas andthe nature energies. I would sit out under the trees in a huge ancient forestbehind my dorm and meditate.One day, while sitting against a huge old Hemlock tree and meditating, I felt Iwas being watched. I slowly opened my eyes and to my delight, there was asemi-circle of animals around me. There were a couple of birds, a squirrel, a44chipmunk and a raccoon, just in a semi-circle. I know this sounds like somethingout of Siddhartha, but it really happened. These animals were peacefully staringat me and appeared to be in a state of great calm and bliss.We have within us a wonderful divine spirit -but we have to know it, practiceit, and affirm it in our lives so that these things are possible. This is what,to me, faith is: You act as if it is so, and it is so. And when you act as if itis so, it will be. Ultimately, it is an exercise of surrender, of giving up selfto the great Spirit.45"},{"pageContent":"6 INEFFABLE ONENESSIn the Sufi tradition there is the story of the master who is trying to teach astudent how to levitate across the water. The student is at the edge of the bodyof water, intellectualizing and thinking, 'Well, I'm heavier than water; I'mgoing to sink and I'm going to drown.\" The master turns to the student and says,\"Leave thyself behind, and then walk upon the water.\"This is the grace - I call it operative grace- that you have to find to achievethese things spiritually You have to practice it and let it unfold.You have to know in your heart that it is possible — not just believe insomething in the ordinary sense of belief. You have to say, \"It will be,\" andyou then do it. But it is being done not because of your ego; it's being donefrom the greater Mind that stands within you.Realizing this is a paradox: On the one hand, our individualities are thevehicles through which the unboundedness can manifest and express. Once youunderstand that, you understand the concept of being a clear vehicle for spirit.So, on the one hand, there has to be individuality to be able to have it happen.On the other hand, you have to be freed up enough from self to let the largerdivine Being shine through and let these things happen. And then it will happen.I survived my own adolescence by finding this pretty much on my own, with somehelp from the unseen realms. But if I hadn't found it, I am quite sure I wouldhave been dead by age 20. Most people who would have come out of the kind ofsituation I was in as an adolescent boy would have ended up a drug addict or acriminal. I attribute this transformation to the guidance, protection andinspiration from the Great Spirit, the Divine Being -- and somehow I was willingto be open to that. When I opened to It, It all rushed in. It was all there forme. And It is always there for each of us.I tell people, \"As soon as you're ready to open to That, it's there.\" And it'sthere for any purpose. I don't care if you're in the emergency department,trying to save a life, or you're an airline pilot, or a carpenter. The unboundedDivine Mind46is always folded within us. It's a matter of knowing this, being open to it andletting it operate. So, you have to get out of your own way and let It happen.When I was living in Israel, my father, who was a chain smoker and an alcoholic,became deathly ill. I now realize that he also had very serious Post TraumaticStress Disorder from World War II, from doing hand- to-hand combat with theJapanese in the Pacific islands. One day, I heard from family that he had aninoperable golf ball sized tumor in his right lung. Back then -- this would havebeen around 1978; it was not thought that the available chemotherapy would work,but they would try it any- way. And so I was called back to the States to makeburial arrangements: the doctors said he had about six weeks to live. When I sawDad I asked him, \"Do you want to die from this?\" He said, \"No, I'm not ready.\"So, I taught him meditation and I taught him prayer. Now, you have to understandwhat a hard-boiled atheist, and bitter man he was, and of that generation, bornin 1916. But still he said, \" I'll do this.\" So, I gave him some books to readand then I personally taught him meditation, visualization and how to heal withmind from within.You have to first center and go into a deep, quiet state of consciousness thatgoes beyond self, where the real power is, which is divinity. It's that whichtranscends ego. And then from that state, do the visualization. So, you bring inwhat I call the God factor or the divine spirit factor.So I taught my father to do this. I said, \"Just do it. This is a matter ofsaving your life. Whether you believe it or not, act as if you do.\" So, he did.I then went back to Israel, and I would go to the beautiful Baha'i shrine onMount Carmel. Every day at lunch, I'd go there and I would do the samevisualization as I taught my Dad. Then I would pray for his healing.Well, a few weeks later, he went back to his doctor. (We did pick out thecemetery plot, but I knew he'd be okay.) The doctor took some x- rays and found,suddenly, that the huge tumor was gone. And the doctor went, \"My God!\"- it wasone of these \"miraculous,\" spontaneous healing's. But we knew exactly whathappened.My father ended up living several more years and dying of congestive heartfailure and emphysema from smoking, because his lungs were just blown. Butbefore he died, a memory came back to me of sitting with him in the back yard ofour house in Charlotte when I was young, maybe 12 years old. He said, \"You know,I really don't want to live much longer, just long enough that you kids are allgrown and out of the house.\" (He was pretty inebriated when he told me this.)Now, when he had his lung cancer, my little sister was still living at home. Andthe year after she left, he died. I told my sister, \"You know, we do create ourown reality.\" He scripted that.47The cancer that should have killed him didn't, but he totally gave up on hislife and died as soon as all the children were grown and gone. He did exactlywhat he said he was going to do, even though I am sure he did not consciouslyremember saying it.So, we're much more powerful than we think we are, no matter who we are. And wedo create the life that we have.During this same period of time, I learned that I could be in a state where Icould visit people at remote distances. Now, a lot of people say, \"Oh, thatmeans you were astrally traveling.\" I did astral travel as a teenager, but thiswas different!What I learned to do was to realize that you don't have to separate the astralbody from the physical body, but simply realize that the entirety of creation isfolded within each individual. We are truly a quantum hologram of the wholecreation. When it is said, \"Thinkest thyself a puny form when within thee theuniverse is folded?\" a rhetorical question is being asked which illuminates aprofound truth: All is folded within the awake mind within.A relatively primitive way of visiting others through spirit is to actually havean astral projection, where the physical body and the astral body separate andyou fly off. But a more developed, simpler and safer way of doing it is torealize that all this is folded within you.By going into a state of consciousness that is non-local, that is thetranscendent state of awake-ness, every point in space and time can be accessed.And when you experience that, then, using your will subtly, you can open up andsee a loved one in another place. And this is what I would do with my lovedones.Just before I went to Israel, I had this shown to me. I had a great aunt who wasvery sick who had lung cancer, and was dying. She was one of the few members ofour family who really did care for us, so I always felt very close to her. And Iremember her as being always very sweet and very kind, Aunt Irene.The day that she passed away, I awakened in my bedroom and she was there. And Isaw her as, probably, a 40-year-old woman, instead of a 70-some-year-old womanwho'd been very sick with cancer. She was radiant and beautiful. I don'tremember anything being said; it was just a beautiful, loving presence and atonce a goodbye and a lasting connection. The next day, my twin sister called meand I told her the experience. She said, \"Well, I'm calling you because shepassed away.\" I asked, \"What time?\" And this experience was exactly at the timeof her passing.So, we're always connected through the Oneness of the great Spirit with eachother. It's a beautiful thing to realize, because once we do, we realize thattime and space are not barriers at all.48I remember one time camping with a friend in the petrified forest in Arizona.My wife Emily was back at our home in North Carolina.Suddenly, I sensed that she wanted to be able to know that she could communicatewith me, but I was in the wilderness. So as I laid down to go to sleep under afull moon ,I meditated and went into a state of unity consciousness.I expanded into that peaceful state of awareness and saw Emily in our bedroom.Now, Emily is someone who rarely remembers her dreams. I knew she was sleeping,so I went into the bedroom and connected with her soul. I showed her exactlywhere I was and what I was doing. I sent the message that anytime she reallyneeds me, I'd be there - that we're always together - that we are one in Spirit.A few days later, when I came out of the wilderness, I called her. She said,\"You wouldn't believe this lucid dream I had! You were in this place... \" andshe proceeded to described exactly where we were camping! “And you told methis:..\" and repeated the message I had given her. It was a beautifulrealization and it was reassuring for her and for me. It showed us what we cando and that we're never alone; we're never apart; there is never separation.When we chose to unlock the box of separation, we have the key. The key is thisawake mind within us and the will to use it. You must have a living faith.Yogananda (a famous Vedic teacher) once said that spiritual lassitude and thelack of spiritual adventuresome-ness is why people never grow.Once you have these experiences begin to unfold and you say it is possible, yourcertainty that it can happen increases; then you do it more often and it becomesmore and more and more powerful. A positive feedback loop is created.It's like a snowball going downhill. It picks up its own momentum- but you'vegot to leap over the edge!One year for our anniversary, Emily and I went to Costa Rica and stayedsomeplace on the Pacific Coast. One night, after we'd fallen asleep, an amazingthing happened to us.Emily woke up in the middle of the night and as she looked over towards me shesaw a silvery grey form lift up out of my body and fly out the hotel window andleave. And she thought, \"Oh, my God. Here I am, stuck in Costa Rica, and we havefour kids back home, and Steve just died!\"I was having what I had always called one of my flying lucid dreams, which I'vehad all my life. I was flying over the jungle and the edge of the ocean. Eventhough it was the middle of the night; I was seeing with celestial vision, so Icould see the gorgeous quality of the water and the jungle, as if it was daytime; but everything had its own light from within it, as opposed to lightcoming from the sun. I saw the most beautiful, alive colors and light. It wasone of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. I was flying along in a stateof complete freedom and happiness.49 All of a sudden, that ended, and I found myself back in the room, thinking I wasjust waking up from a dream. And I felt Emily looking at me. I looked over, andher eyes were like saucers! She exclaimed, \"Thank God, you're back!\" And I said,\"Back? Where have I been?\"She said, \"Well, you left.\" I said, \"I've done no such thing. I've been here thewhole time.\" And she said, \"No, I saw you leave your body!\" And then shedescribed to me what she had seen. That's when I realized that many of theselucid brilliant dreams are soul travel experiences. Now, Emily normally doesn'thave these metaphysical experiences -- she is your quintessential Earth motherand loves every minute of it! But she actually saw my soul fly away, because Ithink she was in a relaxed state of mind, where her filters were down. And thefilters being turned off allowed her to actually see my spirit, lift up out ofthe physical body and fly away. She saw me as I left to enjoy the deep,spiritual beauty of earth.I first found divinity through the doorway of the creation that the Divine Beinghas put here. The highest expression of it, of course, is the Earth around usand the sky around us. It is very Native American: Being part Cherokee andCatawba, I have a deep love for the Earth.This has a lot to do with the work I'm doing now. My love and passion for natureand Spirit is what moves me. I'm motivated by the future I see of Earth and herchildren. I see it and know it is possible.It has been said that the best way to love God is to love his creation. I viewit this way: There's the divine, Infinite Mind that's the inner being of God, ofthe Supreme Being. But the entire creation is equally infinite, and that's theouter robe, or raiment, of God. The creation is the outer expression of the samething, and it's all one, perfectly one.Even as a child, when I'd look up at the stars and see the sky, I didn't seeempty space. I saw joy and felt an awake presence. I felt the divine being,expressed through nature and through the creation. As a scientist, I view itthat way. This view is not incompatible with the study of the biochemistry offlowers - seeing how incredibly wondrous and extraordinary it's all puttogether, whether it's genetics, whether it's physics, whether it'selectromagnetism, whether it's quantum physics, whether it's string theory,whether it's biochemistry, molecular, anatomy, physiology -- it's all anexpression of an incredible conscious living Being. All of this is the outerbody of God, phasing, resonating, moving as matter or space or time or energy.Thus, every created thing is a doorway to the Creator. Walt Whitman certainlyknew this, and Thoreau and Emerson. Nature is a great teacher. We have come outof the womb of Mother Earth, which is an outer expression of the infiniteGodhead.50Infinity is within us and within all things, but not divided - eternally in Itsperfect wholeness. Everything is within and perfectly connected to each other.It's the perfect quantum hologram.The question is: Is there a meta-theme that encapsulates all these experiences?The big theme and the transcendent theme is an ineffable oneness. Oneness.If you have the ability to experience this state of consciousness, where youtranscend space and time and materialism, you can encounter someone from anotherculture on Earth or another person from another planet or another realm, andrather than seeing them as \"other,\" you see them as \"same.\" This is veryimportant, because the consciousness of 'otherness' is rooted in ignorance.Otherness is ignorance, whereas oneness is enlightenment.If you can look at all beings and see that they're awake and conscious, just aswe are, you can experience your oneness with them. This is true no matter howdifferent their intellect, body, emotional timbre, or fund of knowledge may be.All these things that we usually focus on are really ephemeral. If we look atthe fact that they're awake and experience that state of awareness where we seethe transcendental value of the unbounded Mind, then we won't see them as\"alien\" or \"other.\" And this is true whether you're talking about someone fromZimbabwe or Saudi Arabia or Alpha Centauri. It really doesn't matter - becauseit's another sentient, conscious being who has folded within his reality theawake-ness that is this universal aspect of our own selves.If you can experience this state of Oneness, first of all, you can communicate,which is very important. Secondly, you will not feel that there is anything tobe afraid of. Thirdly, you will see nothing to have a conflict over, because thethings that are different really aren't essential and aren't important.I think you could put the founders of every religion on Earth together andthey'd have a grand old time with, probably, no differences amongst them. It'sthe divisions that men create, out of egotism, materialism, chauvinism,ignorance ,hatred and stupidity, that cause the problems. The experience ofOneness is the indispensable experience so needed at this time...So, the meta-theme that I have taken away from my own experience of these statesof awareness is that of oneness. It is the meta-theme of the next half a millionyears: growing levels of oneness. And out of that grows perfect harmony, peaceand enlightenment.You see this all around us. The world is becoming more integrated and morerelated. One of the great challenges of the extraterrestrial question is - whatlevel of oneness must be attained for humanity to be universal - to be able torelate peacefully to conscious but non-human life?We live in a cosmic moment, where humans are starting to go into space, and51we're beginning to wake up to the fact that we're being visited byextraterrestrial civilizations, and simply realizing the oneness of humanityisn't enough. We're going to have to transcend even that and go to a level wherewe understand the universal aspect of the mind; the fact that conscious mind,awake-ness itself, is a universal singularity and that the awakeness within thebeing of a life form from another planet is identical to the awake-ness withinus - even if our intellects are different and our bodies are different and ourfund of knowledge is different. All those things really are not essential.This, then, speaks to the need for a universal spirituality. We live in a timenot just of the need for the establishment of world peace but of universalpeace. A time where such a peace can only be actualized fully through theacknowledgment of the universal nature of spirit and the universal nature ofconscious mind. Otherwise, we will say, \"Well, humanity is all one, and humanscan have peace, but then there are all these others out there\" - and what shallwe do with them?The truth is that these life forms are conscious and awake through the sameinner awake-ness that shines within each of us. There is absolutely nodifference.Knowledge of This eliminates all fear -- if you can be in that state ofawareness, you are in the state that is eternal and immortal, because it isoutside the limits of time. And it's infinite, because it's not restricted byspace. So, that state of consciousness is the safest path to being able toestablish world peace and universal peace. This is why the fundamental challengein the world today is spiritual.52"},{"pageContent":"7 UNIVERSAL PEACEWe are in a cosmic moment. Humans today- albeit in classified programs -have themeans to travel among the stars. So, we must evolve from a human orientedspirituality to a genuine universal spirituality And if that doesn't occur, wewill not be able to evolve to the next level of human destiny.Some say, \"Well, this is a tall order. We're still here beating each other up -and now we're going to have to deal with relating to life forms from elsewhere.\"But look at it this way: when we acknowledge that we're not alone in theuniverse, it will make humans — all humans -- seem like very close relatives.Now, in order to deal with the challenge of under- standing other civilizations,we will have to transcend the anthropocentric view of spirituality and evolve auniversal spirituality. This is actually an extremely positive development.These challenges will propel humanity into truly developing a larger, genuinespirituality that has been missing for so long through our misguided beliefsystem of separation.The truth is that there is no separation. I've spoken to many Native Americanpeoples who relate that one of the extraordinary things in the early days ofnative peoples encountering Europeans was the extent to which we lived in thesense of things being separate. The Native Americans considered this thinkingquite strange. As for the aboriginals in Australia who still practice 'dreamtime' and are aware: they know that there is no separation. There's a sense ofintegration with the stars, with the infinity of things, with other peoples,worlds, and with each other. The extent to which we live in a separate way wesuffer. And the extent to which we live in a sense of oneness within ourselvesand with all that there is, we are freed from suffering.So, that's the essential theme that I see that keeps repeating. It is theexperience of a universal oneness rooted in the experience of non-local, cosmicmind. World peace isn't going to be enough: it is time for universal peace. It'sthat or nothing. There can be no human future without universal peace.That's the time we live in, and that's the challenge of the coming era.53We must know ourselves as universal, awake beings, and on that foundationuniversal peace can be established. It may first be just studied intellectually,but ultimately it must be experiential.We live in a time where universal education and the universal ability to readshould open up the whole array of knowledge to every denizen on the planet. Andthose who would care to be gatekeepers or bottlenecks - and keep a choke-hold onthe flow of knowledge - simply need to step down and stand aside.Let's be honest. There was a time when one out of 1,000 people on Earth knew howto read. And the clerics were scribes, and they would read and repeat to themasses what were in spiritual teachings.But this is not needed in a time of universal education, where the majority ofpeople can read. So, go read, and then gather together in your own spiritualcommunity and share. But you don't need to anoint someone to be a guru orpriest. To do so is actually deleterious to your spiritual development. It doesnot matter if it's some New Age guru or people running around in robes sayingthat they're your entry point to the forgiveness of God. To me, it' all aharmful holdover from a time now gone.I'm not saying that everyone who shares and teaches such things are frauds. I'msaying that people who set themselves up as final arbiters, special priests ifyou will, of spiritual knowledge are misguided. That time is over. We are atleast 100 to 150 years into a time when no one on Earth has needed a priest, arabbi, a mullah, or a guru, except as a facilitator to teach.Ultimately people will wake up to the truth, but the fact is that the spiritualinfantilization of the masses is something which is a very entrenchedinstitution. What I mean by spiritual infantilization is the situation where thepower and access to enlightenment or spiritual knowledge goes through thesefilters, or control points. And everyone else is acting like children, ratherpassively receiving it. That is a type of learned behavior - and you have tounlearn that behavior. This is spiritual codependency.Granted, there's a role for people who want to share and teach spiritualinformation and pass it from one generation to another. But, I'm talking abouthierarchy and the power grab and the control drama and the mind set of spiritualdependency. Unfortunately, this spiritual codependency is very, very powerful interms of getting into people's minds where they feel like they can't learn andexperience truth on their own without having someone there directing every step.One of the positive things about the early years of my life was learning that anindividual can learn these truths and experience enlightenment with littleformal education and no specific person directing it.The close-minded orthodoxy of religion is equaled or exceeded by the close-minded orthodoxy of scientists who,54in our society, have become the new high priests. Remember: Scientists arehumans first and scientists later. So, they have all the failings and all thefoibles of humans. Just because a Harvard professor has a PhD, it doesn't means/he doesn't have the same pitfalls that a priest would have in terms of selfaggrandizement and egotism. They, too, can become fanatical and dogmatic in thebelief system in which they've been indoctrinated, in lieu of searching for thetruth.Most of the problems that we face in our world today, whether they be spiritualand religious or scientific, political and economic, are all because people areholding onto some perspective that has nothing to do with the truth but has todo with their own belief system and addiction to something that's outdated, andthey can't let go of it. This is certainly true of scientists. There arecountless examples of how the mainstream scientific community has rejectedenormous breakthroughs because it didn't fit into their belief system.This is why I say to people, \"One should have very few beliefs, but an abundanceof faith.\" You can have infinite faith- but the specific beliefs you hold needto be minimal. Otherwise, people get trapped in brain-washed dogma, whether itbe scientific or religious. They then become chauvinistic and egotisticallyattached to it. And as soon as that happens one has stopped searching for thetruth.We need a genuinely humble, universal spirituality. We must want to find thetruth. And if the next door that opens cancels some of our previously heldconvictions and beliefs, then so be it. This is one of the reasons why, whetheryou're a physician or a scientist or someone doing spiritual work or aneconomist, the mind-set of being attached to an idea— as opposed to beingclearly focused on wanting to know the truth -- is a hindrance to finding truth.On a personal note, I'm very grateful that, prior to going into medicine, I hadstudied meditation, health and diet so that I came into medicine with a broaderparadigm. I could take what was good in the medical and scientific area, withoutgetting brainwashed by it.This meta-system trapping happens in every profession and in every field. Ithappens because people confuse the current state of knowledge with the ultimatestate of knowledge. And the ultimate state of knowledge, no one has but theDivine Being. But because they know what they know they think they knoweverything. And the truth is, most of what there is to know isn't known byanyone, ever.And so I think the only way to avoid the pitfalls of the high priests ofscientific circles or of religious circles is to have enough genuine devotion tofinding the truth and a willingness to reform what your assessment is. Thus,there are very few things that become fixed and absolute. And everything else isrelative. But that's the nature of the world we're in. It's a relative world.And there are very few things that need to be fixed and absolute.55If you study the central teachings of every spiritual tradition on Earth, theyall agree: the existence of God; the qualities of forgiveness and love; andthese larger spiritual themes. They're all universal. Where they differ is inone social teaching or another, or one cultural bias or another -- which arereally ephemeral and changing with each spiritual tradition and aren't thatimportant, anyway.You know, you may be very orthodox in some areas, and that's fine if it worksfor you. But don't think that that is the end and the beginning of all knowledgefor spiritual traditions. It isn't. There are very few things that need to be inthe category of ongoing, certain truths. And most everything else should be in astate of evaluation and evolution.But we're not trained to do that. Our educational system, whether it's religiousor scientific, is designed to create rigidity and, in that way, engendersfanaticism. It then becomes a fiefdom that those benefiting from the structureof belief want to protect at all costs. And certainly this is true in science,where there are people who, no matter how much evidence you put in front ofthem, would say, \"This can't be true.\"Our science advisor for the Project, Dr. Loder, has a colleague at theUniversity of New Hampshire who said he wouldn't care if you gave him one ofthese new energy machines and he tested it and proved it worked: he stillwouldn't believe it because it's not possible!So, these become fanatical belief systems that are just as tragic as thefanatical belief systems that certain religious extremists are attached to. Andall of it ends up hurting society.One of the things I want to share is what happened at MIU where I was learningto become a meditation instructor. There, I was experimenting with theapplications of higher states of consciousness. One night, late, I was sitting,meditating, and I saw a young woman in my class in my mind's eye, and invitedher to come over to my room. We were going to talk about spiritual matters andthen meditate together.All of a sudden I saw her, in my mind's eye. I was in a deep quiet meditation,and I saw her leave her dorm, come out, walk around the campus, come up thesteps, and then, bang, bang, knocked on my door. And it so startled me, becauseit was almost like a dream, except I was actually seeing it in living color. Iopened the door and I said, \"Oh, it is you.\" She said, \"Oh, were you expectingme?\" I said, \"Well, I saw you coming.\" And it was just crystal clear.During those years between ages 16 and 20, I started experiencing these sorts ofthings on a daily basis, if not many times a day- and at times continuously. AndI have used this ability to create CSETI and the Disclosure Project and to56identify a lot of the intelligence sources and the witnesses we have. Some ofthem find me, but I find them, also, or draw them in. We'll talk about thislater. It gets into high strangeness.Remember, the universe is folded within us, and we have enormous powers, everyhuman being -- not just me, and not just you; everyone; they're the same -- andthat when needed, we can call upon this Higher Power to do what is needed toachieve something wonderful.Now, if you're willing to make the ultimate sacrifice and you also have thisknowledge, then you cross over into what's called a spirit warrior: someonewho's willing to do what's needed, no matter what the risks are. You existbeyond fear.I believe that these early years prepared me to do what I then later had to doand was part of my purpose in being here. I always felt that when I had thenear-death experience and was told, \"You may come with us or return back to yourbody on Earth\" and was told that Spirit wanted me back on earth, that I had thiswork to do. I could have chosen to have not come back here and gone on andstayed in that state of awareness with those very high celestial beings. I choseto submit to their will- not that I was happy with it. I told you initially itwas rather depressing- having had the childhood I had, and being very sick -- Iwasn't really interested in coming back here. But I acceded to it.Transformation doesn't come into being except through the agency of the freewill of humans. And that means us. Now, obviously, between 1980 and 1990 I wasaware of these things- but having recently been married and having four childrenin eight years (between 1980 and 1988) and becoming a medical doctor andresidency and starting my medical practice, I had a full plate. Yet, I didn'tforget these lessons. I knew that it was the time to establish the family andcareer and the ability to further do this work.57"},{"pageContent":"8 TOTAL TRANSFORMATIONWe cannot just stand back passively and let rogue kleptocrats run roughshod overthe entire Earth and cannibalize the Earth, killing millions of people. In adiscussion I had with a Special Ops person from Fort Huachuca, Army intelligenceheadquarters in Arizona, I asked, \"At what point would it have been appropriateto restrain, by any means necessary. Hitler and his inner circle?\" My opinion:\"At the earliest possible moment.\"There are rabid dogs amongst us. And some of them may never be amenable toeither reason or spiritual enlightenment. Do we then say \"Oh, then we can't doanything\"? The right of self-defense is a universal one.This is where I am, clearly, not a pacifist. I believe in peace, and I believein using higher spiritual abilities, but ultimately, there is a place forintervening and protecting innocent people when there is someone who is trulymad and on the loose. In a sense, we live in a society that has a largecomponent of collective insanity It's a society gone mad. And there are somethings that need to happen that require discipline and decisive action.But you don't cross over into vengeance or anger. It has to be done for theright reasons, just like when you discipline a child, you're not doing it out ofvengeance and anger, but you're doing it for their edification and theirenlightenment and for their future.In raising our children, we have had high expectations and firm discipline. Wewere not permissive. At times, our children thought we were too strict, but asthey have grown older they are so grateful for having been raised with values,discipline and love. I share this about my own family philosophy to say that, insociety, it's the same way One can be very loving but also see where there's aplace to intervene and be disciplined and not to indulge misbehavior or to lookthe other way when there are rabid dogs ripping apart a peaceful flock of sheep.This requires wisdom. We live in a world where people polarize around either animpractical New Age spirituality and pacifism or a traditional \"us versus them,58let's kill everyone we don't understand\" mind- set. Neither is going to get thisright. We have to be cognizant of the time we live in. And the time we live inis not the time of the perfect world- yet.There was a 400,000-year cycle that literally started with \"Adam,\" who was thefirst Avatar of that cycle. That cycle ended in the mid to late 1800s.What opened at that point is a 500,000-year cycle, the hallmark of which isuniversal peace, the oneness of human and universal life, and the eventualestablishment of a genuine enlightened civilization on Earth. This will be atime of an unbroken period of peace that, at first, will be a political peace, atime of no more large wars and conflicts on earth. But that will then give birthto a period of a great peace - the peace of enlightenment where the entire Earthand everyone on it will grow in spiritual oneness. Earth will become one of theextraordinary centers of enlightenment, and known as such throughout the cosmos.So, as bad as things seem now, that's not where it's going to stay! And it isn'tgoing to be like this much longer. This shift to a new time, a new era, has beengoing on for about 150 years. But out of 500,000 years, we are just at the earlycrack of dawn. And as one cycle closes and the other opens, a time of maximumchaos is created. This is why we are in the most chaotic period in knownrecorded history. But soon that will give way to another reality on Earth.The knowledge and spiritual capacity for world peace was available through thepeople who lived on Earth 100 years ago. The means of communication were thereand the \"Divine Will\" and \"Divine Plan\" were there. Humans elected not to act.It wasn't done, because we failed to do it.So, this is our choice. And now we're living through the ramifications of it.It's our choice right now, this moment. We're all making choices, collectivelyand individually. And the aggregate of the operation of that free will has givenus the world we see today.The events that happened back in the mid- to late 1800s are that a universalAvatar, as I understand it, appeared and then disappeared during that time. Thatis, the over-soul Avatar for the next half a million years appeared, createdspiritually a new world, and then vanished. The information, knowledge and,within the finest realm of creation, the means for this new time, were allcreated. It's all here now: Look and you will see it! We as humans have to seeit, realize it and manifest it. We're the ones, now, who have to carry the restof the water. The oceans are there, but the water has to still be delivered towhere it's needed, and we're the ones who have to carry that water.It's a wonderful time, actually. And I'm quite certain that most people have noidea of the time in which we live. What they're waiting to happen has happenedalready.59In the Bible it refers to \"a thief in the night,\"--that this new world would becreated spiritually, and this knowledge would appear--and it would be like athief--nobody would know until He was gone. Well, that's very true.So, I'm saying a lot of those events are 100 to 150 years in our rearviewmirror. And most religious, political and other leaders are looking backwards.They're waiting for something to happen that happened already. So, the Earth andeveryone on it, in a sense, is in a state of retardation, because it's beenhijacked, mostly out of ignorance. And so the only way to fix ignorance is toshare knowledge.As I said earlier, one of the problems is that nice people have a serious flaw:They're nice. And because nice people are nice, the rabid wolves and the maddogs can rip them apart. So, we live in a time where a certain amount ofclear-eyed spirituality and genuine knowledge has to be joined with some realcourage.We live, unfortunately, in a time where spirituality has been equated withpassivity. This is a very dangerous thing, because it's a propaganda orindoctrination that's designed to create people who are spiritually oriented andvery nice, but very passive and ineffectual. And in that passivity, the rabiddogs can have full sway.People like Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr.: These were people who were flawedhuman beings just like we all are, but they were spiritually oriented, and hadthe courage of their convictions- and they acted. They were threatened and tookrisks and ultimately were killed.I am asked in almost every lecture I give, “Aren't you afraid?\" I answer: \"Well,look. You have to understand that as an emergency doctor, I've taken care of Idon't know how many people killed over a 50-cent beer. \"Two high school boys came in Code Blue, dead on arrival, that we tried to save.This happened because one of them had patted the other one's girlfriend on thefanny and they pulled out knives and sliced each other's guts and hearts open.I've seen people die over such ephemera and over such trivial things that if youunderstand what these issues are about and you're not willing to step up to theplate and take a bullet, you're a coward.I've said flat out to some of these folks who are involved in these projects,\"You want to whack me? Go ahead.\"I'm on borrowed time anyway. I figure that everything past the age of 17, when Iwas clinically dead, is a gift.The world needs people who understand what the task is and are willing to go thedistance. The time we're living in right now is a real test for people to getthat balance -- it's a yin and yang, male-female attribute sort of thing. Wemust combine the spiritual and loving with the active, assertive anddisciplined. Change requires that we bring those qualities together. It's liketwo wings of a bird. And it's often said that in humanity, the male and female,are two wings of a bird. And so long as one is impaired, the bird will never flystraight and will never stay aloft.60This is not only in terms of men and women, and basic equality, but it is alsoabout the attributes that we have to evince and demonstrate in our life tomanifest that kind of harmony.We live in a world where women generally are taught not to be assertive andactive, and men are not taught to be spiritual and loving. This is a perversionof human nature. It has nothing to do with male or female. There may bedominance in these areas in one sex or the other, but the task is to bring theminto harmony. The duality of 'this or that' we have to transcend. We have tobring both of these qualities and attributes to bear in our lives.Unless we do, we're not going to be successful in establishing the kind ofcivilization on this planet that will be enduring. Had we done so for 100 years, I have no doubt in my mind that we would have already had a permanentlyestablished peaceful world civilization here. I'm certain by the mid-1900s wewould have had electro-gravitic transportation between cities; we would have hadfree energy and non-polluting energy forms running the Earth; we would have hadall these things. People laugh and say, \"Oh, it's like the Jetsons.\" Well, infact, some of these cartoons and science fiction stories that were created werebased on very well-known facts and prototypes of technologies that were up andflying around back in the '50s and '60s.We have not collectively or individually exercised our powers through theoperation of free will and the knowledge that goes with it that can create thisnew world. As soon as we do, we'll have it. And until we do, it won't happen.This is why I encourage people to not look at this as some visionary, futuristiceffort, but in reality, as doing a bit of a catch-up. We can talk about the realfuture, because the establishment of a peaceful civilization using non-harmfultechnologies to run our civilization is something that really could have beenachieved decades ago. It's a total transformation of the way humans will live onEarth and explore the cosmos.61"},{"pageContent":"9 INFORMATION IN UNCONVENTIONAL WAYSThe love of higher states of awareness and the study and application of suchknowledge continued even in my medical career. I've spoken to a number ofphysicians and others who are in high stress jobs. Believe me, a busy ER is astressful place to be. Everything in our lives can be applied if we're open tokeeping ourselves integrated to that experience, including these experienceswith consciousness and higher states of awareness.One morning, I was back in the call room at the hospital at about three o'clocka.m.. I was lying there, just sort of relaxing. There was no one in the ER atthat particular moment after hours of non-stop patients. As I was lying there,in my mind's eye I saw very clearly a woman coming in with congestive heartfailure, and she was dying. I saw it so clearly that I got up and put on myscrub top and shoes and went out to the ER.The nurses said, \"What are you doing here?' I said, \"I'm expecting a congestiveheart failure patient - an elderly woman - to come in.\" They said, \"Well,there's been no call.\" And about two seconds later, the radio call came in fromthe paramedics: 'We're on our way in with a woman with congestive heart failure,respiratory distress....\"This type of intuitive experience would happen frequently in the ER, but itwasn't appropriate to talk about, because our society wants to keep spiritualityand this kind of experience separate from our careers, our families and, ourpolitics and from everything.Another time, a 26-year-old male came in during flu season who thought he wassick with the flu. The nurse triaged him and put him in a medical room. We werevery busy - we had 14 trauma and exam rooms, and one doctor! I went in and sawthis man. He had fever, chills, nausea, body aches and headache and all thesymptoms that you would see with the flu. Normally, most doctors would examinehim, do a couple tests and give him a prescription for Amantadine for the flu,and off they'd go.62I looked at this man and enigmatically sensed that he had a brain tumor. Now,there were no symptoms of a brain tumor. He did not have any neurologicalfindings such as paralysis, numbness, seizure, etc. But I had the power of myconvictions. So I turned to the nurse and I said, \"I want a stat CT of thehead.\" Well she looked at me like I was crazy and said, \" Dr. Greer, he's onlygot the flu!\" And I said, \"Just do it.\"Thank God I didn't have to go through an HMO or some insensitive bean counter,because if I had, this man would be dead today! ( Memo to the politicians andmoney whores ruining our medical systems: Medicine is an art, as well as ascience.)So, from this intuitive knowledge, I ordered a CAT scan. He really did not,objectively, meet any criteria for ordering one. But I said, \"Whoever's on thetable, yank them off. Get them out of the scanner; I want this one in, stat.\"So, he goes in, and the radiologist calls back, stat, and says, \"Dr. Greer, thisman has a massive astrocytoma\" --a big brain tumor -- that was herniating thebrain stem!Now, here's what was happening: All of his symptoms were because the brain stemwas being pushed through the opening at the base of the skull, the foramenmagnum, and it was putting pressure on the area that controls temperatureregulation, nausea, etc. So, he was having all these symptoms of fever andchills and nausea, but it was all due to this tumor and its strangepresentation. The shape of this tumor was such that it wasn't affecting anyspecific sensory or motor function. It was a very atypical situation.It was serious enough that, with this kind of pressure being built up in thebrain, it eventually would have herniated the brain stem, cut off therespiratory and heart center, and he would have suddenly died. I immediatelyreferred him to neurosurgery for stat decompression. We had to helicopter him,actually, to another facility.\"Dr. Greer, why did you think this patient had a brain tumor? I would have neversuspected it with his presentation! I would have never even gotten the CATscan,\" the neurosurgeon told me. \"Oh, I just had a hunch...,\" I said. The truthis that it was a type of sensing -- the pop culture would say \"remote viewing.\"It was an intuitive knowing, because the symptom complex, if anything, wouldhave led me into a facile diagnosis of the flu, and I would have \"treated andstreeted\", as we say. But if I had not followed my inner knowing, in less than12 hours he would have been dead. As it turned out, he had neurosurgery and itwas successful.We really can bring this kind of capacity and knowledge into our careers, eventhough we're not \"supposed to\"-- and particularly those of us who are hardscience people. In science and medicine, this sort of thing is very frownedupon.63And yet, I have found that there are a number of physicians who have had similarexperiences that they won't talk about openly for fear of ridicule.Another time there were two Code Blues going on at once. Well, I'm one doctorand I've got two people who literally have had their heart stopped. The one wehad been working on first had been in arrest a long time. Then another one camein. The first patient was in a type of rhythm that is fatal if you don't getthem out of that rhythm. We'd used everything that could be used: cardioversion,all the medicines, everything. I won't go into the gory, technical details. Thefact is, it wasn't working. Finally, we were going to have to call the code -end it - but I just sensed that this person could get back into a normal rhythm.So I put my awareness on the heart, visualized the conduction system of theheart, and called on this higher power- the power of God- and mentallyvisualized and willed his heart going back into a normal beat. And it did, atthat instant! Now, it may have been a coincidence. Some of the skeptics wouldsay, \"Well, these other things kicked in.\" But I don't think so. It was veryspecific. But it was out of necessity -do or die, literally. So when you have todo it, and you call on the divine power in the universe- and it is urgent,heart-felt and done with a pure heart - almost anything is possible! When youhave to do it, then suddenly you find this ability, by turning within to thepower of God, to do it.A number of things like that happened over the course of my medical career andactually continue to happen. A few years ago I was driving outside Helena,Montana. It was before we moved here to Virginia, and I wanted to move my familyfrom North Carolina to someplace, and I wasn't sure where. So I was drivingaround Montana, exploring the area. All of a sudden I found myself driving alongin broad daylight and I saw what I call an image override. It's like you havetwo screens, like a screen within a screen on TV.As I was driving down the road, in my mind I saw an intersection in broaddaylight with a terrible traffic accident, where I knew there'd be fatalities.It wasn't vague. I said to myself, \"This is going to happen- I'm going to comeacross this soon.\" So, I started looking around the car for what I might have inthe way of any medical items - even a straw if I had to make an airway oranything.About an hour later, I was at an intersection on the east side of GlacierNational Park, in the middle of nowhere. It was one of these dangerous highwayintersections where it was a stop on a busy highway, and someone just didn'tstop. A Suburban went through the intersection and T-boned a Ford Taurus rentalvehicle that had a German couple in it.64When I got there, the elderly couple in the Taurus were dead at the scene- bothof them. And the other people in the Suburban were very seriously injured andpinned under the dashboard. So, I focused on helping the survivors in theSuburban. Finally a rural paramedic crew came along, and we all worked tostabilize them.Then as I was doing this, I looked up and I saw the mountain that I had seen inmy dream a week before I traveled to Montana. One evening I had a dream wherethere was a mountain that reminded me of the shape of the Mount of Temptation inIsrael, outside Jericho. I clearly saw a scintillating light, like a spirit,over this mountain. The dream experience was very spiritual, but there was noother message or image, and I thought, \"How strange.\"After helping the survivors, I connected with God and said a prayer to send thedeceased man and woman to the highest level spiritually and to connect with God.As I did that I looked up and saw a beautiful white light appear above themountain at the exact moment that I was connecting their souls to God. And thenit was clear to me that this was why I went to Montana - to be there at thatmoment in time, but beyond time, because it was also eternal. I was there forthat purpose, and to also help these two other people, who did survive.We got a chopper in there, but they could only take one patient, and I had todecide which one was going by chopper; the one who had to go by ground couldhave died. I prayed I made the right choice.You have to be willing to follow your guidance and the intuition you get- andyou have to be willing to act. I've done that throughout my medical career, nomatter what the situation. And I recommend that people accept thatresponsibility. It is accepting your power and then accepting the responsibilitythat goes with that power.I've spoken, since then, to a number of people who've been fighter pilots or whohave been commercial airline pilots in a critical situation where they've hadsimilar pre-cognitive experiences that helped them avoid disaster. Many peoplehave these experiences in their lives. And the more critical or stressful thework is, the more likely this type of ability might be called upon. But I thinkit can be brought into almost everything you do.This can be a way of life, and not something that you do just on the sideoccasionally. The understanding of spirituality and divinity need not bereserved for an hour or two on Sunday or an occasional event here and there. Itcan be an inner awakening that is with us all the time - and called up andapplied all the time.There may be a ritual or a service that does something for you, but the realityis that the conscious connection to the unbounded Divine state is something thatcan be cultured and lived and brought into everything that we're doing at alltimes.65That's a discipline and way of living where we are always connected to Spiritand living in that state.Once the nephew of one of our nurses was brought into the ER because he had beenhit head-on by a pick-up truck while riding a motorcycle. It was a stormy,horrible day. He was very critical, and basically had the same injury thatkilled Princess Di, which was a ruptured thoracic aorta -- often not survivable.I began working on him with the great nurses we had and somehow I sensed that hehad a ruptured aorta. We took a chest X-ray. The X-ray was rather ambiguous, butI felt that it confirmed my sensing this injury.Well, the general surgeon on call came in and said, \"Oh, he wouldn't be aliveand look like this if he had a ruptured aorta!\" I said, \"Man, he's got aruptured aorta.\" The surgeon asked, \"How do you know that?\" I said, \"I'm justcertain that he does.\" So, I wrestled with this surgeon, fighting with him notto ignore it or treat him in a way that could suddenly kill him.I got him to a thoracic surgeon and CT Scan of the chest, and it was thenconfirmed. But if we had not treated him very carefully in terms of hydration,blood pressure, everything else, we could have blown open the thoracic aortacompletely and he would have died.Over and over and over again, these events happened in the ER. I would love togive a course integrating medical science with intuitive knowledge. Yes, ourgadgets and our technologies and sciences are wonderful, but there is also arole for the art of knowing and intuition. It is a balance and we need to regainit in every aspect of our lives.Someday we will have a civilization where people working in critical areas, nomatter how material the science may seem, will also accept that there is a roleto play for higher states of consciousness.When in the thick of something that serious, I find myself operating in a waywhere I am connecting to multiple levels at once. It's very intellectual, andthere's a lot of specific scientific knowledge to call on. There are manyphysical, material things to do and a lot of management decisions to be made.Part of it is the compassion, but there is also a fierce, unrelentingdetermination to help that person. The nurses would tell me that if anythinghappened to one of their loved ones, they'd want me to be the doc on call. Itdidn't necessarily come across as compassion, but that's where I was operatingfrom. Good God, emergency situations are intense - we are not sitting aroundswinging crystals and counting prayer beads!If a doctor got in there and didn't know what he was doing, in my quest toprotect life I would physically remove him and say, \"Out. You're killing thisperson. I'm taking over.\" So part of me is very alpha male.66I was awake on these other levels as well. See, I wasn't shut off. If I got anintuitive image or some sort of a clear view of something, even though it wascoming out of a non-\"scientific\" intuition, I would not rule it out. I would beopen to the possibility that I needed to pursue it.It gave me an edge in situations where I really shouldn't have \"known\" to getthe CAT scan for the brain tumor. I should not have known to treat that personlike he had a ruptured aorta, because it was not typical or clear enough. Iwould catch things earlier, or find hidden problems because I was connected tothis non-local, expanded and intuitive Spirit that is within all of us andwithin all things. It is a very interesting dynamic and very nuanced.Before I started CSETI, I was in my bedroom one afternoon, sitting on the sideof my bed. Suddenly, I got what I call an override, an image. Again, it's like ascreen within a screen. You don't lose consciousness or your view of the 'realworld', but you also see very clearly, in full color, another scene or place.In an instantaneous packet of information, I saw Air Force One either landing ortaking off from Colombia, South America. It was hit by a shoulder-held,surface-to-air missile that was fired by rogue elements within the Colombiandefense forces that were on the payroll of the drug cartels. They were going tokill the first President Bush when he was visiting there. I saw the facility,the landing strip. I saw the grass around the field. I saw the woods on the edgeof it and precisely where the missile came out. It was catastrophic — thePresident was killed. \"God,\" I asked, \"What in the world am I suppose to do withthis information?\"I prayed for guidance. The dream lay heavily on my mind.Weeks later, Emily and I went to Washington for a medical meeting. That night, Ihad a dream. In this dream, I was with Barbara Bush, and she was all dressed inblack and getting out of a black limousine, and we were at the funeral of thePresident, George Bush. I thought, \"Oh, my God. He really is dead.\" An enormousheaviness came upon me; \"This should have been prevented.\"I awoke in a cold sweat and turned to Emily, telling her my nightmare.Emily is my closest friend, companion and soul-mate, and I tell her everything!I asked, \"What am I going to do? Call the White House and Secret Service andtell them about this?\"\"Well, why not?\" she asked. We continued to discuss it all day and that nextevening, we got out the phone book and looked up the number for the White House.Below was a number for the Secret Service. We were amazed it was actually in thephone book!I called the number and I said, \"My name is Dr. Steven Greer, and I'm anemergency doctor.\" I apologize, \"I know this is going to sound completely crazy,but I had a very clear image of an assassination attempt on the President. Andit's67serious.\" The first person I talked to said, \"Hold on, sir. I'll forward yourcall.\" And there was a long silence, I knew they were putting me into somesupercomputer database. Then, the chief of the protective detail for thePresident, at the White House with the Secret Service picked up the line.I started to apologize again and he said, \"Sir, we take this sort of informationvery seriously.\" I assured him, \"You know, I've never done anything like this. Idon't cry wolf. I met my wife in a lucid dream; I have this ability to seethings in the future that come to pass. This happens spontaneously when it needsto.\" He was very serious and attentive and said, \"Just tell me everything.\" So Iexplained, \"In my dream, the President is going down to Colombia; either ontake-off or landing, Air Force One is hit.\" I described everything -- that it'san inside job and it is Colombian defense people who betray the security detailand are acting on behalf of these people who run the drug cartels.The Secret Service agent said, \"What do we need to do to avoid this?\" I said,\"Well, if you can't get the President to cancel the trip, you need to, at thelast minute, change where Air Force One lands. You need to be sure that everyonewithin striking distance of a shoulder-held missile is connected to your peopleand not Colombian. And you need to sweep the area that far out. He said, \"We'lldo it.\"Weeks later, in \"Newsweek\" I read an article that said that, in fact, a contractfor $5 million had been put out on the life of President Bush and that armsmerchants in the Middle East, including Israel, had sold the drug cartels inColombia shoulder-held missiles! This article, which came out AFTER my vision,stated that advisors to the President were asking him to cancel this trip.It turns out, of course, he did take the trip and he wasn't killed. I was toldyears later by a very high intelligence official -- and also a Secret ServiceAgent -- that what I had said, was taken to heart, and they did make securitychanges. I doubt President Bush ever knew anything about it.That's when I learned that, in fact, there were some very smart and good peoplein the intelligence community and in the Secret Service who understand the powerof consciousness. They clearly respect this type of ability.I tell people: Don't be afraid of your convictions—trust them. Sometimes youhave to go out on a limb. I certainly took a flyer when I made a cold call tothe White House Secret Service and told them this story. But I also think thisepisode built credibility in these covert circles, because they knew that what Iwas saying was accurate information.After calling the Secret Service, that night I had another very lucid dream.Except this time I was with Barbara Bush and we were all dressed in white, andriding white horses, and everything was light and very happy. It was clear to methen that the President would be safe.68I think many people receive important information in unconventional ways, butit's just not talked about. We need to make it okay to talk about these things.We need to make it okay to bring this sort of discussion in without the fear ofridicule or the opprobrium of our peers. We can do that by the dynamic force ofour example- by walking the talk.69"},{"pageContent":"10 TONE OF CREATIONIn 1990, after being, in medical training and practice for a while, I had aseries of events happen that suddenly brought me back to the experiences of thelate 1970s. This is the story of how CSETI got started. On the full moons ofJanuary Februaryand March of 1990,1 had some really extraordinary experiences, that awakened inme the contact of many years before.The first one happened when I was in our bedroom of our home in Biltmore Forest.I was walking around in the bedroom getting undressed. All of a sudden, veryclearly a thought was projected or came to me that said, \"Pick up that which youhave dropped.\" It wasn't in a pejorative or accusatory way at all. It was areminder to just pick up that which I had not been doing for a while. It wastime.It was very specific - almost like a code phrase that opened up an entireuniverse of knowledge. It's hard to explain in words. But I knew what it meant.I knew exactly what it meant. So I immediately connected to universalconsciousness, to the whole concept of universal peace and to theextraterrestrial presence. And I thought, 'Well, I guess its time...\" And Istarted wondering what I was supposed to do with this sort of instruction?Initially, I simply considered it. I began looking into ET related issues again.Then one day someone told me about a group that was meeting in Asheville thatdid a lot of meditation and they wanted me to come to the meeting. So, I went,and there was a woman there, who never had met me and knew nothing about myexperiences.After about 30 of us sat down, she looked me right in the eyes and said: \"You'reconnected to extraterrestrial beings from other worlds.\" And I'm looking for thedoor! Here I am, an emergency doctor living in this city! She stated, \"You needto pick up that again.\" She used almost the same phrase. That was on the fullmoon of February of 1990.On the full moon of March 1990 — I meditated in my bedroom. That next day I hadto get up early to go to the hospital, but I decided to do something I had notdone since 1977: The CE-5 protocol.70I did the protocol and invited these extra terrestrial beings to visit me. Afterreminding them who I was, I showed them exactly where I was located inAsheville, NC. I showed them the house and the large front yard and its exactsetting. It was a three-story Tudor house, about eight thousand square feet, andset among huge beautiful trees. I showed the ETs all the details and then I wentto sleep.I woke up with a beautiful craft semi-materialized out in the front yard of thehouse, in the wee hours of the morning, and found myself consciously floated onboard. We were all in a quasi-materialized astral state, and as we floated outand went out into space I could look back and see the beautiful earth recedingaway, floating in infinity.Then we went by what I am assuming was the moon. There wasn't a sign there thatsaid, \"This is the moon, Welcome to the moon, population 39,\" but it looked likethe moon to me. And there were enormous ships that were hovering over the moon.They were oval with struts that came up from a large craft with two othersimilar shaped oval discs above and towards the rear of the main ship. They werejust floating silently along where the terminator section of the moon is,between the light and dark side of the moon. An incredible amount of energy,like magenta colored plasma discharges, were going between the surface of themoon and the underbelly of these ships. They were enormous and as we passed by Iwas told by these ETs that these craft were there making preparations for thecoming decade or so. This happened in 1990, so it is clear that they were makingpreparations for major events for around the time we are in right now.We went further out into our solar system, and the experience transformed sothat the material aspect of the ship disappeared - it was just like in 1973 whenI was 18 when everything became translucent, and I was out in space without acraft around me- and yet somehow it was still there. It was verymulti-dimensional, but at this point transcendence beyond linear time/spacebecame the dominant perception. It's like the most perfect fiber optics: Imaginethe walls of your room completely disappearing, even though they are there andyou are still protected in a controlled environment. At that point, I went intoa state of meditative awareness and transcended into unity consciousness; I wasinfinitely awake and the entire cosmos was awake and perfectly synchronized asone.As I entered that state I began to gaze around the solar system and saw thatevery planet was surrounded by space which was filled with infinite energy andlight. The empty space was actually teeming with light and energy. I coulddirectly see the baseline energy of the universe - the field of energy and lightfrom which the entire material cosmos emerges71from Infinite Mind - from the Godhead. Instead of the darkness between stars andplanets, there was an enormous light and energy with solid planets moving asislands of energy in this field of energy and power. Then, As I gazed at eachplanet, I directly perceived that each one was awake and conscious and had aspecific tone and personality. Each created sphere had a very specific tone -andif I were more musically inclined I could recreate it. They were all pure tonesand very specific. As I looked at Mercury I saw he was rather androgynous butmore male; Venus was definitely female. Jupiter was just fantastic. And Mars isdefinitely male. The Earth: Definitely female.As I gazed at Earth, there was a very beautiful tone emanating from her.Remember, each planet had its own tone of creation -- no two tones were alike.Some much higher and some very deep and baritone, but all were beautiful tones.As I gazed at the Earth, I connected with her as an awake conscious being andshe communicated to me this infinite and crushing -- I use the word crushingbecause I couldn't tell the story for years without weeping - love. And therewas a sense of melancholy also, for what was happening to her and the damagebeing done to her and the suffering of humanity upon her. It was profound andbeyond words. It was one of the most emotional and moving experiences of mylife.Earth was very clearly saying how great her love was for her children and thather purpose was to be the womb for creating life that could become enlightenedand grow towards Divinity. But she was also suffering tremendously from therecklessness and selfishness of her children. So there was this enormousmelancholy - a sadness beyond my ability to convey in words. And yet, towardsthe end of our communion, she made it very clear that this suffering would notcontinue for much longer. Earth made it clear that this burden would be liftedsuddenly.By now, I was in such a state of deep love and emotion that my heart chakraopened fully and an enormous love and celestial perception dawned. Thiscelestial perception of the cosmos caused me to see the light of creation andall things suffused in love - the pure love of God. And as I went into thatstate, I heard all the distant worlds, every star and planet and the entirecreation, singing as one - like a trillion tones blended into the one pure toneof the creation.At that point, I transcended into a state that I cannot describe. It was a statewhere I heard a singular tone that was the perfectly harmonized tone of theentire creation humming, singing. It was the primal tone emanating from theearliest manifestation of relativity out of the infinite mind of God thatmaintains creation. It was the most beautiful experience of my life.As I transcended into that - I became one with that state and stayed within thatstate of Being. I don't know how long I was in that condition. But know thatthis is what is all around us. The music of the spheres is a reality--and withinthe tone, one can transcend to the infinity of the cosmic Being.72This primal tone wasn't \"Om\", per se. I believe that is a human attempt toreproduce this ancient experience that is the perception of the sound of theprimal thought emanating from the Infinite Being that creates the entirecreation. It was on the level of the near death experience in terms of thetransformative effect it had on me. After I stayed in that state of completeunity consciousness and God consciousness, my individuality dissolved. All thatexisted was infinite Being - and even the creation and Creator were one, thesame, infinite awake-ness. I stayed in that state with it vibrating through me -just permeating me - for what seemed like eternity. Because I was beyond spaceand time, it is meaningless to talk about it in terms of how \"long\" it was. Butafter, I found myself relatively conscious again. Suddenly I was back in mybedroom and became aware of the glowing outside the window where the craft was.I laid there peacefully and went to sleep.The next day I learned that one of our children had a lucid dream with little ETchildren, who were teaching her games ET children played on their planet! Thisdaughter did not understand the games, so she began to give the ET childrenrides on the back of her banana seat bicycle, up and down our driveway! Thischild had never heard me talk about ETs or any of these experiences! Itconfirmed what happened to me as real. And it became very clear to me that I wassupposed to pick this whole issue up again just as I had heard two monthsearlier in January, 1990.At that point, I began wondering: What am I going to do? How am I going to dothis?I decided that I would just start looking into the subject again and find outwhat was out there. I found out there was an organization that was having ameeting in Florida where there had been many UFO sightings, the so-called GulfBreeze Sightings near Pensacola. This meeting was in July of 1990. I had theconcept of what I wanted to do and that was create in the world interplanetaryambassadors that would be doing what is now called the CE-5 Initiative, theClose Encounters of the Fifth Kind Initiative. I went to this meeting, andstarted sharing these ideas and concepts, and the right people suddenly justsurfaced and came into my life mysteriously who said, No, don't do it throughany existing entity, create your own reality.Then a man who had been involved in national security issues connected to thissubject for years and who was a lawyer came up to me and told me what I neededto do: \"Form an organization; hermetically seal it so it can't be penetrated --in other words, no open board and no open membership; avoid, if you can, beingobscure; and as quickly as you can, given what you are going to be doing andwhat your role is - get out in the public.73You must let millions of people know what you are doing - otherwise you won'tsurvive. If you are obscure, you are dead.\" He gave me the best advice ever.I knew that much of the information at this conference was false, that it wasdisinformation. I immediately recognized that.Then, in August of 1990, I was in the upstairs den adjacent to the masterbedroom, sleeping because Emily was up and down with the youngest baby and I hada 24 -hour shift at the ER the next day. Around 2 am I awakened - and was calmlysuper-aware, very awake. In the corner of the room was a cluster ofscintillating lights that was hovering near the ceiling. I acknowledged it, andimmediately sat up and picked up the pad of paper beside the bed. I then wroteout the entire plan and concept for everything we have been doing for the last15 years. This included the CE-5 Initiative protocols, the plans, everything. Itwas as if this scintillating light had awakened all the organization and planwithin me and they were just pouring through me. This lasted for an hour or so,and then I went back to sleep and got up around 6 am to work in the emergencydepartment for 24 hours. It was then that I formed CSETI, The Center for theStudy of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, came up with that name, the concepts,the CE-5 Initiative, the need for disclosure, and the entire interplanetaryambassador program. All of it just unfolded in that one night. So things cancome in packets of knowledge, all at once, mysteriously.Of course, I didn't know anybody and nobody knew me. I mean, I was just acountry doctor in North Carolina with four kids and a golden retriever and acouple of cars in Biltmore Forest, just living my life. But these experiencesmade it clear: I must start working on this. But how do you take that vision andactualize it? We had to bootstrap the whole thing.Over the next couple of years, when I would articulate something that I neededto do or somebody I needed to meet, through mysterious means that person wouldbe introduced to me, within hours, frequently. I will never forget the time thatI said, \"We really need to get this information to the Secretary General of theUnited Nations...\" and within about an hour or two someone called who I hadnever heard of and said, \"You don't know who I am but I am very good friendswith Boutros-Ghali and Mrs. Boutros-Ghali, Leah Ghali, wants to have you come toa meeting...\". That is how all this happened, in a very inscrutable way. It wasall guided, supported - from behind the veil, a hand was moving.Our ability to get the truth to the right people all came about because thedoors opened mysteriously. And this is how I knew that what I was doing was theright action.By 1991, I had decided that I needed to begin to train people in the experience74of the Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind Initiative, the CE-5 Initiative. ACE-5 is when humans deliberately welcome and make contact with extraterrestrialpeople by using a set of protocols to vector them into an area to interact withthem. That was the first project of CSETI.Within a very short time I also wrote all the assessments of the situation.Those white papers were created very quickly. They immediately got picked up bypeople at the CIA and distributed throughout the aerospace industry. I had a topcovert aerospace person call and say, \"This is the most accurate assessment ofthe UFO and extraterrestrial issue we have ever read.\" It is the original paperand is in the first book, \"Extraterrestrial Contact: The Evidence andImplications\".This aerospace scientist then asked me, \"How do you know these things?\" I said,well, that is a long discussion- so we had a long discussion!In the winter of 1991, we decided to go to Belgium, where we had heard therewere an enormous number of encounters with massive triangular shaped craft. Asyou know, in '89, '90, '91, outside of Brussels, thousands of people had seenhuge triangular UFOs and they had been filmed, photographed and tracked onradar.Well, at that time I really didn't train people for this. In my innocence, Ithought that everyone could just sit down the first time and enter cosmicconsciousness, bilocate into space, vector them in and be ready when a shipshowed up! I soon learned that much preparation was needed!In the early days that is what we did. We just took a group of people over andwe did it. The 1st group was me, my wife Emily and two others. We went out andwe had the most extraordinary experiences. You can read about them in,\"Extraterrestrial Contact: The Evidence and Implications\". We ended up meetingsome of the top people in Belgium who were working with the Belgium Air Force onthis. We then went out to the areas where these huge craft had been seen.One area was near Eupan, which is in eastern Belgium, near the German border.While at a farm, suddenly a string of lights appeared. It was in an area whereone of the gendarme had seen a massive craft. But all we saw were what lookedlike a string of lights in a field. Of course, everyone said, \"Those are justsome lights on the farm.\" I knew they didn't look like normal lights. We satthere and we watched an object sitting in the field and suddenly the lightsvanished! The next day we went back and discovered that there were no streetlights, no wires, nothing in that whole area where the lights had been! It hadbeen a craft sitting there.On another night we were near Henri-Chappelle, at the military cemetery on aridge. It was a terrible night: raining; sleet mixed with rain. We stayed in thecars and did the CE-5 meditation and vectoring. All of a sudden we heard a deeprumbling vibration. Imagine something that felt like the size of the EmpireState Building, rumbling, humming like a transformer.75It had a deep vibration. And suddenly, as we looked up in the cloud -- the cloudcover was only a couple of hundred feet above the ridge or less- something thatlooked like a full moon dipped down, and moved underneath the clouds. Emily sawit first, actually. It was a corner of one of these massive ships. Then itslipped back up. It just stayed there right on top of us, resonating, hummingwith a deep vibration. As this was occurring, I saw in my minds'-eye theoccupants of the ship. The energy vibration that we were feeling was becausethey were completely checking us out and connecting with the vehicle and with usas a group and individually. It was very close; close enough that you could feelit.In the course of this trip to Belgium, I learned that many of the people thathad reported seeing these objects had had their stories sanitized by themainstream UFO research groups. For example, I went back and met with some ofthe police who were in a small village where a massive ship the size of threefootball fields was hovering over a steeple. Part of their story was 'sanitizedout' of the report so that they, \"wouldn't lose credibility\" The way itdisappeared was not that it glided off and then zoomed out into space like amovie from Hollywood. This huge triangular ship, 800 feet long on each side,hovering above the town square, suddenly collapsed into a pulsing red ball oflight the size of a basketball. It moved a little bit and then vanished straightout into space, in the blink of an eye!Now, the reason I relate this is that many people will see an orb and they willthink it is just an orb. But it could be an enormous half mile long craft thathas changed energy forms, some would say dimensional shift, and appear as a ballof light. So having that experience taught me two things.First of all, the extraterrestrial capabilities are extremely advanced. Butalso, what is in the UFO literature has been largely sanitized so the mostsalient aspects of the technology have been taken out- sometimes so that peoplewon't be discredited because it is so unusual. But then, if it isn't veryunusual, most of the time this means it is an \"alien reproduction vehicle,\" thatis being manufactured by Lockheed and Northrup!People often ask, \"How do you know the difference between a man-made UFO and anextraterrestrial vehicle?\" It's very obvious if you are ever close up to one,because the entire quality of it is different. The ones that areextraterrestrial are extremely advanced, in the sense that they are \"awake.\" Theactual craft itself has artificial intelligence and is conscious. The beings onboard are connected into it and can connect to you consciously. And the kind oflight it gives off is like nothing you have ever seen on Earth: It isextraordinary. It looks like it is not of this world-and has an energy andintelligence associated with it that is very advanced.By 1991, I began to branch out and I appeared at a few conferences to presentthese concepts. My point was:76These ET craft are here and they are under intelligent control, and these lifeforms are able to interact with us. If they know that there is a group of humanswilling to do this for peaceful purposes rather than for military purposes, theywill respond, if possible.One of my great concerns is that the relationship between humans andextraterrestrials has been hijacked by a military-oriented group that aremismanaging the relationship. They are not conscious about what they weredealing with. There is nothing written anywhere that says we have to cede thatrelationship to a group of people who have arrogated it to themselves- and whoare ruining the embryonic relationship between ET worlds and humanity. Therelationship between humans and extraterrestrials, has been totally neglectedbecause there is no formal program that is open and honest dealing with it inthe State Department or the United Nations or from any other peaceful group. So,it became clear to me that we should reach out to the ETs; if we don't, a vacuumwill continue to exist into which others intent on doing harm will step.Those approaching this issue from a purely military perspective or technologicalperspective can only do harm. To correct this dangerous situation is the purposeof CSETI and the CE-5 Initiative. We must create a peaceful rapprochementbetween humans and extraterrestrial beings and create a relationship that wouldredound to the benefit of all concerned - rather than to only a clandestineoperation that would benefit a handful of people trying to commandeer thetechnology for their own selfish purposes.By 1992, we had found enough people interested in this that we started doingsome larger expeditions. In March of 1992, I went to the Pensacola area andtaught about 50 participants this protocol.The very first night I decided we should go to the state park beach. We were outthere just a few minutes, and at around 8:30 p.m. an ET craft appeared.Initially there were two ET craft, and then there were four of these UFOs,shaped like globes with an amber-red light in the center of the bottom of thecraft. They appeared to simply manifest in the sky near us. We started making abig triangular shape in the sky with very powerful search lights. Suddenly,three of these UFOs made a perfect equilateral triangle in response.Then I would signal to them twice and they would signal back twice. I wouldsignal once and they would signal once. But what was actually going on was thatthere was a conscious ET presence that was on the site. There was a non-visibleand electronically projected consciousness of the occupants of these vehicles onsite. A few other people sensed this and jumped in their vehicles and roaredaway! They were thinking, \"Oh my God this is actually for real!\" There were fourseparate cameras that filmed this, and there were also two former Air Forcepilots who77saw it, one of whom was connected to a UFO organization as the Eastern Directorof Research. That organization would not let him write up this event and put itin their journal. It was sanitized out. This mass witnessed Close Encounter ofthe Fifth Kind was filmed and witnessed by everyone. The next day it wasreported in the local paper with photographs of the UFOs. But then the UFOsubculture itself (which traditionally has been controlled by thecounter-intelligence 'spook department') sanitized all of the reporting out ofthe literature. This was a real eye opener to me about what was going on in theso-called UFO community....But we also learned that humans could come together, decide to contact ETs, andhave an event take place - all in the framework of peace and cosmic awareness.78"},{"pageContent":"11 THE OFFEROnce word of this CE-5 in Florida got out, it was a feeding frenzy A few weekslater I was invited to a conference, in Atlanta, that had a whole group ofspooks (covert intelligence operatives) present. They had heard what hadhappened and wanted to learn the details. It was a quasi-public conference thatwas run by a group as a front operation to gather intelligence for the covertprograms dealing with UFOs. (This is not unusual.)I arrived in time for the main banquet of the conference on Saturday night. Theyhad put a place for me between the former head of Army Intelligence, GeneralT.E. and Dr. Death, Col. MK who was head of the psychotronic and so-callednon-lethal weapons systems programs. There were also NSA people and otherintelligence operatives there. I knew something was fishy - there was alsopresent a slippery shadowy ops psychiatrist who was a side-kick of the general.And I'm thinking, \"Oh, brother, here we go into the snake pit.\" But I hadnothing to hide. I am not doing this as a secret operation. I was certainlysavvy enough to know who they were and why they were there and why I was there.At this point it was very clear. There were also present some people who werefriends of the British royal family.The banquet speaker was General T.E., and after his talk he asked me, \"Could weget together with you for a little while after this?\" I said, \"Sure.\" So theytook me to a hotel room and it turned out it was packed with people who wereconnected to covert programs and black operations, corporate, military andintelligence- this hybrid MJ12 successor entity And quickly this littlegathering became a barrage of questions - all directed at me. Again, I hadnothing to hide, so I openly shared. It takes two to play a spook game and Ifelt I didn't need to. But they began to ask all kinds of questions.79At one point I remember someone saying \"Just who the hell do you think you are,going out there, basically bypassing the national military command to do this?\"They knew that we had discovered the Rosetta stone of extraterrestrial contact.So I said, \"I am a denizen of Earth and I have every right to be doing this.Besides, my mother's family were some of the original founders of the UnitedStates- they fought in the American Revolution and were prisoners of war withthe British. Beyond that my father was half Native American, his ancestors werehere waiting for you Europeans to get here. So we have every right to be doingthis!\"I finally said, \"Look, I know who you folks are but I have had up close andpersonal contact with these extraterrestrial beings and their craft and theirtechnology. You can't deceive me about what is going on. You can't fool me,number one. Number two, I am not rich but I am wealthy enough as a physicianthat I don't need your damn money, so you can't bribe me. And number three, whenI was 17, by any medical definition, I was dead. I had an enlightenmentexperience, so I am not afraid of death, and you can't frighten me away! I amgoing to do this one way or the other. There is nothing you can do about it.\"And I remember the look from the General. It was: \"We know exactly who this sonof a bitch is.\" So here began the process of a covert group that was desperateto infiltrate us. What had been warned in 1990 had begun in earnest.The next month, in May of 1992, I had agreed to help convene a conference at theSt. Malos retreat outside of Rocky Mountain National Park with Astronaut BrianO'Leary and Maury Albertson (who was one of the co-founders of the Peace Corps)and the Institute for New Science. It was a private retreat and we invitedeveryone involved in the civilian UFO world. There were a number of other peoplewho, of course, turned out to be intelligence operatives including General T.E.and his friend the psychiatrist.I wanted to create a collegial environment where there could be a sharing ofinformation and perspective. In reality I found out that the whole UFO civilianworld was rife with paid disinformation hacks and warring factions that withintwo nanoseconds of arriving at this facility had pulled out their knives andhatchets and were sinking them into everyone's back -- including my own. Thatwas when I learned what a snake pit the civilian UFO world really is.80During the course of this retreat, the General and the psychiatrist were tryingto court me into joining their group. The General said, \"You know, we have anorganization that deals with this that is very private.\" -a loaded word meaningsuper-covert. I knew what he was saying. Then he said, \"If you would just mergeyour operation with ours we will give you as much money and as much power andaccess to technologies as you could ever dream.\" And I said \"Thanks, but nothanks. I don't need it. I thought I made that clear when we met in Atlanta lastmonth.\" But he persisted in attempting to convince me- because they knew thekind of threat we could pose to their covert monopoly on the issue. They said asmuch.A good friend of the NSA guy that was there and another CIA guy came to me andsaid, \"You know, they are very jealous of what you are doing because they are ina black box and can only do certain things for certain purposes. You are a freeagent and you can do more than they can!\" I knew this. I explained, \"We may nothave temporal power but we are free - and have other powers that are God-given.\"Eventually, the General went to Emily, my wife, without me present. He told herabout this group- but he didn't call it MJ12. He said there was a board for thisgroup. He said that this board had a certain number of seats on it.Interestingly, he said that the number was nine. Of course, he had done deepresearch into us and knew we were Baha'is and our holy number is nine. So, hesaid there are nine board members, each with his own shield- a certain crest-that would be given to me if I would simply take my organization and merge itwith his. And Emily, being very sweet, said, \"Oh, he seems so nice and he saidall these wonderful flattering things about you!\" I said, \"Yes, dear, but can'tyou see what they are trying to do? Finally I went to them and I said, \"Look,let me be clear. I am fiercely independent and I am going to keep this aprivate, clean, operation with its intended purposes. There is no amount ofcajoling and no amount of money or offers of power that will ever change that!\"By the way, General T.E. has been involved with these covert projects since hewas a very young man. I confirmed this through independent sources. He had beenhead of army intelligence before he \"retired\". But he was just telling peoplethat he was retired. They never retire- until they end up in a coffin.I met a military pilot who, in the 1960's, was in a special operation to pursueUFOs and film them. He told me that once a crew had such an encounter, they weresplit up and sent to various new posts- but that ALL the information went81directly to a guy he was convinced I had never heard of: General T.E.! When hetold me this story I laughed and said \"I know him well!\"After rejecting these advances by the general, within thirty days the entireinternet had websites set up and messages being sent out to the public attackingme. They unleashed all the dogs within the UFO civilian community, within thepress, everywhere. I was called everything from a cultist to a demonic communerwith extraterrestrial sinister forces to a fraud. Then they released the liethat I wasn't a medical doctor. Here I am at the hospital and they have put outthere that I am not even licensed to practice medicine! I have to then releaseto the public my medical license and degree to show that I am actually a medicaldoctor! The psychological warfare and harassment was intense- and continues tothis day. For 14 years it has been a relentless string of attacks, characterassassination, defamation of character, and every kind of dirty trick.General T.E., told me a number of things. For example, he said there wereextraterrestrial craft and facilities underneath the surface of Mars and thatcovert projects had imaged them. He also privately told me about all kinds ofassets that covert programs had that were advanced technologies - up to thelevel of what the ETs had. I was able to gather quite a bit of good informationthrough the courtship that was being attempted.I learned that this particular 'cell' was interfacing with the civilian UFOworld from the covert world -- they are an interface group and they havepenetrated many civilian UFO projects. I knew then why that lawyer had told mein 1990 to be very independent, careful and very public. I had to be a lion atthe gate to protect what we were doing from infiltration and from attempts todestroy it. There would be offers of enormous amounts of power and money,threats and attacks. I would have to be willing to be the kind of warrior that Ihad, in a sense, been trained to be through my childhood and early adultexperiences.82"},{"pageContent":"12 GOBSMACKED![0001.png]In our research, we have observed that there is a pattern of extraterrestrialvehicles being seen over geo-physically unstable areas and volcanic areas suchas in Costa Rica, Mexico, the ring of fire around the Pacific rim; and aroundfacilities where there are many nuclear bases, weapons or power plants.Extraterrestrial civilizations observing Earth know that we are a lot morefragile than most of us realize. We're the proverbial frog in the water that isbeing boiled slowly and we really don't quite know it until we are cooked.ETs have been monitoring events very carefully, and there is a pattern ofactivities that suggest to me that they have concern about what we're doing tothe environment, and the instability that we may be creating. They are alsoconcerned with nuclear material that could do a tremendous amount of damage toearth for thousands of years.In '92, after we went through an initial period of experimenting and traininggroups, we learned that there were these strange things going on in Englandcalled \"crop circles\". There were reports from people like Colin Andrews- whom Igot to know very well and became close friends with- that there were unusualaerial phenomenon and unusual craft being seen in fields, and videotaped. Thereare daytime videotapes of small, foot diameter disk-shaped objects movingthrough the fields, both before there would be one of these crop circles andalso after.In the summer of '92 we took a team of people over to England and decided to dothe CE5 initiative there. By then, a lot of media had found out what happenedwhen we were in Belgium and Gulf Breeze. By the time we got to England, it was amedia feeding frenzy.83This caused some difficulty because a lot of the places where we wanted to setup our contact effort were being totally overrun with curiosity seekers and themedia.I remember one time dashing through the countryside, trying to shake the camerasand media. It was like when Princess Di was being chased through the tunnel- wewere speeding along trying to shake off a German TV crew who was following us sothey could stake us out and see where we were going to be that evening.In July of 1992 we went to a farm in Alton Barns, which was the epicenter of themost interesting crop circles. This was a large farm- over 1,000 acres, and wewere given permission to use the property for this purpose.We set up a number of experiments over the course of the week or ten days thatwe were there.One of these was to go up on Woodborough Hill and as a group visualize aspecific shape of a crop circle. We began the meditative process: firstexpanding awareness, then connecting with the extraterrestrial people, and thenasking them to create the specific shape that we were visualizing.We didn't decide what that shape would be until the night we actually sattogether on Woodborough Hill.We decided that it should be what is now known as the CSETI triangle - anequilateral triangle with a circle at each apex.As a group, we conveyed this precise shape into unbounded, universal Mind, andto the ETs. The next morning, the exact shape we were sending out was discoveredin a field not far from where we were working!No one except this relatively small group of people doing this knew the design.In fact, we didn't even know that this crop circle had appeared until a coupleof days later, when we came across Ralph Noyes who said, \"Oh, we just learnedfrom a farmer that the most perfect crop circle of the season has been found. Ithas the most anomalous bending of the crop and unusual phenomenon in it. And hasappeared on this farmer's land!\" The farmer had been out working in the fielduntil very, very late the night before and went out very early, because it was adry period, which is rare in that part of England. Nobody had been in the field,and it was hard to get to, being right at the base of Oliver's Castle (a steepcliff area surrounding the field). So I asked, \"What shape is it?\"And Mr. Noyes said, \"Well, I've drawn it in my book.\"We bent down and looked at what Ralph Noyes had drawn: It was exactly the shapethat we had projected the night of the experiment!Immediately, Shari Adamiak, my main assistant, and a couple of other CSETI teammembers dashed to this farm.84We went up to Oliver's Castle, and looked down on the field, and it was as ifthe shape had been lifted from our minds and placed exactly in the field. Wewere stunned.Later we learned that some of the tests that were done on the actual crop andsoil indicated that there were electromagnetic anomalies and cell wall changesin the plants. The tests indicated that this was one of the most important cropcircles of that season, from a scientific point of view.Interestingly, a group of people who were there studying crop circles and hadbeen funded by W. B., the wealthy businessman (and some other people connectedto covert programs) sanitized their report of this particular crop circle - andespecially of how it was conceived. Here was the same pattern: The so-calledcivilian UFO 'community', riddled with spooks, had sanitized the Gulf Breezeevent in March of that year now had sanitized this one.This was another indication of how tightly controlled the so-called \"civilianUFO community\" is and how thoroughly it is infiltrated.One evening, while at the base of Woodborough Hill, we were doing our CE5protocol and inviting the extraterrestrial vehicles to come into that area.Suddenly, in the clouds above us, there appeared counter- clockwise spinninglights -- not coming from the earth shining up like a searchlight, but fromabove the clouds shining down. There were a whole series of circular lights thatwere going around counterclockwise shining down from above into the clouds.Shortly after that, it suddenly started raining, very hard - but it was rainingonly on this very small area where we were doing our contact protocols.It seemed as if the ETs had created an artificial weather event to allow a majorcontact to occur - but in the privacy of a rainy,foggy night. Eventually, it wasraining so hard that almost everyone left -- Colin Andrews, who had been inanother area of the farm and a whole group of other people, left.Four of us moved to a narrow concrete road that was on the farm, just wideenough for one vehicle behind another. There was a little pull- out on it wherewe decided to stay.Through my intuition, I knew that the ET craft would come. I was clearly told,\"We will be there later, later.\"So I said, \"Let's just stay here in our cars, and wait.\" It was after mid-night. We decided that we would stay in two separate vehicles, and do theprotocols from there.Then all of a sudden, I heard this banging on the window of the driver's side ofthe car, and it was Chris Mansell (the Englishman that was with us) from the carbehind us. As I put the window down, he said, \"There is a spacecraft rotating inthe field and lit up like a bloody Christmas tree !\"85And I said, \"Yeah, yeah and I'm Santa Claus!\"I felt sure he was joking. He said, \"No, look,\" and as I looked out the window Isaw a ship, about 100 feet in diameter, disc-shaped with a coned top withlights. Around the edge of the disc were beautiful multi- colored lights-red,green, blue, yellow - that were going around counter- clockwise. The craft wasspinning counterclockwise, but the lights were going that direction as well asclockwise, fusing and blending into each other, in a beautiful, very unusualpattern.These lights were like something not of this world. The intensity and thequality of the light was unlike anything anyone had ever seen.And it was so close. Initially it was a little higher above the field, but itcame to within 10 feet above the ground - and in the same field where we were --just a few hundred feet away.We got out of the vehicle and went into contact and signaling mode. But thewoman I was with was completely terrified. She came completely unhinged. Ilearned that, unfortunately, people really do need to be prepared for this kindof event!Her anxiety was in part because we were close enough to this huge craft that thecompass we had was rotating with the craft counter-clock- wise. The magneticfield was actually moving off magnetic north and moving around counterclockwise!The electromagnetic effects of this ET craft also caused our hair to be slightlyelectrified and standing on end. You could sense an unusual silence in the fieldand the presence of the consciousness of these beings who were on the craft. Itwas just astonishing!At this point I said, \"Well, let's signal to the craft with the search- lights.\"And as I signaled to the ship, it moved closer to us and signaled back. Withthat, this woman became quite hysterical, and screamed \"Oh, my God, don't dothat!\"\"But this is why we're here.\" I exclaimed.\"Well, I didn't think they would actually come.\" She said.\"Well, then why did you come. Do you think this is a joke?\" I asked. In hermind, she thought that maybe we would just have a sighting from far away. But itwas a really close encounter with this craft, and she knew that they were therebecause we contacted them and she knew they were signaling with us.Chris Mansell and the Dutch woman who was with us were very calm and relaxed;Excited -- but not scared. But this one person was scared. And the moment thather fear really broke through, the craft stopped coming towards us and thenbacked slowly away.This was an act of compassion. Even though there was no threat at all from thiscraft, the ETs knew someone was afraid, and they gently and slowly backed off.86Then, the ship began to rise slowly and went up into the mist and off into theclouds.As it did so, we could see that it was actually staying up in the clouds aboveus. We could still see its lights, but it appeared as a softly glowing amberobject, floating silently. Amazingly, the compass we had continued to rotatecounter-clockwise, the same way the craft rotated, until the needle on thecompass made a complete 360 degree revolution all the way back to north.It was a beautifully choreographed encounter. At the end of that hour, the skyopened up and this object appeared again, but this time higher. As I signaled toit, it signaled back to us and then it vanished. And that is how that CE5 ended.As the event was unfolding, the rain had stopped to just a mist, and the wholearea was enshrouded in clouds and fog.Colin Andrews told us, as soon as he got on to the road and left, it was dry. Ibelieve the lights seen earlier that were spinning around in the clouds abovethe farm were setting up a weather change that allowed this event to take placein privacy.It turns out that the people who were attempting to spy on our expedition anddisrupt the effort to make contact all left because they were discouraged bythis 'terrible English weather'.I realized from this experience that I really needed to better prepare peoplefor contact. Participants would need to learn how to be more centered inconsciousness so that they wouldn't be afraid, because it is an unusualexperience, and there are unusual physiological and electromagnetic effects whenyou are fairly close to these objects. Being centered in calm, deep awareness isessential.The next day it turned out there were a few people who were on some of thesurrounding hills who saw much of this encounter, so we had corroboration -andword got out. The next day, it was a feeding frenzy of media and publicinterest.Because of this, we did a briefing about this near-landing on the farm in AltonBarns.When Chris Mansell got up, he said, \"There was a bloody spaceship in the fieldand I was gobsmacked!\" It was the first time I had ever heard that word, and itwas just perfect!By 1993, we had decided to expand these efforts and have a more seasoned groupof people called the Rapid Mobilization Investigation Team -- the RMIT.87"},{"pageContent":"13 TRUTH STRANGER THAN FICTIONIn the volcanic area in Mexico, near Popocatepetl, a whole series of ET eventswere taking place and were on the Mexican national news. These craft had beenvideotaped, photographed, and witnessed by thousands of people.In the winter of 1993, we organized a team of ambassadors to go on an expeditionto Mexico to welcome these extraterrestrial people and to investigate why theywere there. Before we went, I had a lucid dream where we were in a specificplace with a mountain, some forests and an ET event taking place. It turned outthis dream occurred exactly seven nights -- adjusted for time zones -- to thehour of when a major encounter occurred with our team in Mexico.We found that on many of these expeditions, one or more of the people on theteam have some type of pre-cognitive dream or experience prior to the eventhappening in the 'physical here and now'.The details in these dreams are very specific- the time of night, the look ofthe area, everything about it. This was also happening to other groups who werebeginning to experiment with the CE-5 protocols.But first, after landing in Mexico City, we were robbed by Federates atgunpoint. Our passports were confiscated. They asked for bribes of enormous sumsof money for us to get them back.We refer to this type of treatment as \"the shakedown factor.\" After majorchallenges, we eventually arrived at a rural area near the volcano. The veryfirst night, we were on the side of the volcano that was closest to Mexico CityUnder the stars, we began to meditate and vector the ET craft into that spot. Itgot so cold at that altitude that frost actually formed on us.Suddenly, a point of light appeared out of space that illuminated us, and a beamof light descended and flashed the entire group — submerging us in a brightflash of blue-white light as if someone flashed a very bright flashbulb. We gotthe sense that the ETs were checking us out- a type of scanning procedure. Atthe same time I felt that there was a message in that event - that they werewelcoming us. We had been in the country six hours when this happened.88The next day we went around the back side of Popo and arrived in the little townof Atlixco, where 90 percent of the people had seen these objects around thevolcano.We sensed that the ETs were there because the ring of fire was going to becomemore and more unstable, and this was the fourth largest volcano in the world,looming outside one of world's most populous cities.We sensed that the extraterrestrial vehicles were there to monitor the situationand take actions to help stabilize the earth.We found a perfect site near the little Indian village called Atlimayaya.Atlimayaya is at the end of the road past Atlixco and Metepec. The glow from thecity of Puebla can be seen from the high plane, at the base of the volcanooutside Atlimayaya.Atlimayaya literally is where the road ends. From there, the native people go ontrails out into the jungle and the forest at the base of the volcano.Off the road to Atlimayaya we set up our operation with five CSETI memberspresent. Once I saw the setting, I knew that it was exactly what I had seen inthe lucid dream seven days before.And so I said, \"This is exactly where we should be!\"The moon was up and about two-thirds full. After a period of doing the CE-5contact protocols I grew very tired and laid down.I settled into a deep meditative state, very relaxed. Then suddenly, I got aclear message that said, \"Sit up and look to the right!\"So I sat up and looked to the right; coming towards us from the volcano, was anenormous triangular craft .We all stood and connected to the ship. I could see in my minds eye the personin charge of the craft and the other beings on the craft-they were all extremelyluminous and white.These ETs were very directly connected to us, by way of a device that was onboard the craft. They were absolutely locked-on to our consciousness, using amind-technology interface device.As always, we were using thought and consciousness as a vectoring tool.To confirm that they were seeing us, we signaled with very bright lights, andthen this huge craft signaled back - and turned directly towards us.Then it made an almost perfect circle around us, hovering very low, just a fewhundred feet above us. It was the size of about three football fields on thesize of each side of the triangle with a light at each corner. As it signaled tous, the entire leading edge of it would light up.All of us could sense the extraterrestrial beings, and three of the five of ussaw the same beings and received the same message about why they were here, thevolcano erupting and what would happen in the future.89The craft then went off towards the direction of Puebla. As it left, we weresaying good-bye, and I signaled toward the receding edge one more time.Suddenly, the other edge of it that was leaving the area signaled back and saidgood-bye.It then descended lower than our altitude and disappeared somewhere into avalley.Later that same night, we were sitting in a meditative state, connecting withcosmic beings, at the base of the beautiful snow capped volcano. As we lookedup, we saw that a very unusual oval- shaped ring of clouds had formed to theleft of the volcano, that looked exactly like a humanoid face !And the two brightest stars in the sky, were exactly centered where there shouldbe eyes.This cosmic face was looking at us from beside the volcano. And there was noquestion in any of our minds that this was a very unusual signal from thesebeings saying that they were still with us.On the day of this event, we had been exploring the area on foot. We went on ahike deep into the jungle and found an ancient pyramid covered with plants thatto my knowledge was not on any map.While we were there, we had a series of very unusual mystical experiences withnature and the volcano. We met some native people who related stories to usabout what they had experienced with the extraterrestrial beings in the area.The messages and images they received were nearly identical to ours.As we left the jungle we looked up and saw in the sky a formation of clouds thatmade the exact shape of an eagle. And the beak of the eagle was pointing toprecisely where our field -work site would be that night. We knew everything wasbeing orchestrated by a higher intelligence, the one Mind of the cosmos throughwhich we are all connected.Over the course of those five days, we had multiple sightings of these ET craft,including smaller disc-shaped ones that would come straight up out of thevolcano, circle the top of it and then fly off into space.All of these accounts have been written up in more detail in my first book.The key to everything that happened is universal awareness and an intent that isgood and peaceful.By 1993, it was clear to me that this effort to create contact between humansand extraterrestrial people was attainable. It was no longer a theoreticalquestion. By then, there had been hundreds of people in the United States,Europe, England and Mexico that had been with us on expeditions where contacthad been made. Many of these events had been filmed, and all of them had beenmass witnessed.90So now what? If we have the body politic and the masses of the people of theearth being lied to about this, how far can we take this? We needed some way ofeducating larger numbers of people in the world. I knew we must bring out thetruth. We needed to provide the evidence and this peaceful perspective to ourpolitical leaders, our governmental leaders and the scientific community- andmost importantly those running these covert programs.Word of our work was out and I developed a network of military, political andscientific contacts between 1990 and '93.We also learned that there were extremely powerful weapon systems being used totarget extraterrestrial spacecraft and destroy them. We learned that rogue,covert projects were running these operations and that this was one of thegreatest threats to world peace- ever. But the entire matter was beingcompletely ignored by the media, by the mainstream military community and by themainstream political community— never mind the man on the street.So at this point I felt it was important to bring together people to try todisclose the evidence and the facts -and explain to the public and our leaderswhat the meaning is behind the ET presence.I began to articulate this concept of pulling together people to disclose thetruth so that it would not be just an ad hoc group of part-time people makingcontact, but society at large would begin to acknowledge that we are not alone.It was time for the community of civilized people to take responsibility for therelationship between humans and extraterrestrial people in an enlightened andpeaceful way.If we didn't do it, no matter how much contact our little group might have, itcouldn't begin to correct the problems of a multi-hundred billion dollar peryear Shadow Government that had enormous technological prowess, reconnaissanceabilities and weapons that were being deployed all over the world - and inspace. We knew these weapons were attacking ET vehicles and the people on them,and we had multiple independent corroborating military witnesses to this.In the summer of 1993, I was invited by some people to come to a home near theMonroe Institute in Virginia to discuss the initiative to disclose all thisinformation to the world.Some very fine people were there - but later I found there were some people whowere there with other agendas. We discussed how to best achieve disclosure andhow to reach the larger society.Towards the end of that meeting, I decided to commit to this effort - what isnow known as the Disclosure Project. (In the early days it was an unnamedinitiative and later had a project name given to it called, \"ProjectStarlight.\")As I was leaving the area near the Monroe Institute, which is very near where91we now live, I was hit by some sort of an electronic weapon system. I suddenlybecame completely and utterly disoriented, febrile - as if I was on fire fromthe inside.I became so disoriented while driving my vehicle, that I didn't know if I wasback in England (we had been in England earlier in July--or where I was! Ididn't know which side of the road I should be on, and in fact I discovered Iwas on the wrong side of the road! If I had not been able to transcend the powerof this weapon, and snap back in and re-orient, I am certain I would have beenkilled in a head-on collision leaving the area of the Monroe Institute. It wasvery disturbing.I learned from that experience that there are shadowy people watching what weare doing very carefully, and that they would do almost anything to try to stopus. But when I'm faced with such a challenge, my reaction is to fight twice ashard!Over the course of the next few months, I talked to people I knew who were inthe political and military realm who showed great interest in what we weredoing. Many supported the Disclosure Project. We put together a team of peopleto create a plan to get this information to our leaders.I began to articulate this agenda to groups, explaining that it was time for thetruth to come out. As a result, a large network of support developed. After oneof these talks in Colorado, a gentleman (I'll call him M.J.) came up to me andsaid, \"I know a few folks in Washington who can help.\"I'm all ears.\" I said.\"I'm friends with the new CIA director, Jim Woolsey. He used to be on the boardof my institute. What you're saying makes sense. And it needs to happen.\" Hesaid, very sincerely.It turns out, M.J. had been one of the people following our work, and hadwritten a book -- under contract from the Coast Guard. It was for the militaryin general and there was a section of the book on wildcard scenarios of eventsthat could happen in the future, but were not anticipated by the mainstreammilitary.A section of it was about CSETI and the CE5 initiative- though it wasn't named.But it described everything we had done, and even included scenarios like agroup going out to a beach in Florida, making contact with ETs!I then realized there was another whole orbit of people watching what we weredoing. Many of them were futurists and people connected to top national securityand intelligence fields who felt that this information should begin to come out.Around that same time some people in New York who were friends with LauranceRockefeller approached me and said, \"You know, this is something that LauranceRockefeller is very interested in.\"\"I'm willing to meet with anyone about this.\" I said.92I ended up having a series of meetings in the summer and fall of 1993, and oneof them was with our military advisor for the project, a Naval Commander, whosefather and grandfather had both been deputy directors of NASA and before thatNACA. He had been very supportive since 1991, when we first met, and he saidthat, \"You know, I can help you with the military end.\"Then another man surfaced who was a friend of Bill Clinton who said, \"I can helpyou with the political end.\"And other people surfaced and said, \"Look we can get this information to the CIAdirector and to the national security people.\"And another man surfaced who wanted to get this information to Dr. Jack Gibbons,who was the President's Science Advisor. Then another man, whose brother was thescience advisor to Al Gore, the Vice- President, helped us.So a whole group of people assembled rather quickly around this time.I was very aware that there could be a number of mixed agendas going on. And atthe same time, I was acutely sensitive to the need not to be prejudiced againstanyone because of his affiliations. My goal was to simply speak the truth,explain what needed to be done and educate.By this point, there were CIA people surfacing, flying into Asheville where welived then, saying, \"Do it and do it now! We're part of a group that wants tosee this happen. It has been kept secret for too long!\"My largest effort has been associated with providing information and perspectiveto people who are in clandestine programs or are in what people call the'control group' or high cabal.Much of what I have written and said has been oriented towards providinginformation and a new paradigm to those people.In September of 1993, our military advisor had approached the man who at thattime was the head of intelligence for the joint staff -- an Admiral. He laterbecame Director of Naval Intelligence (DNI).Our military advisor said to the Admiral, \"Look, I'm working with Dr. Greer ofCSETI, and we want to meet with the people at the Foreign Technology Division ofWright-Patterson Air Force Base.\" This is the entity that had received some ofthe material from the extraterrestrial vehicles retrieved from New Mexico in the'40s. As it turns out, this group has been renamed the National Air IntelligenceCenter or NAIC. But in 1993 it was called the Foreign Aerospace Science andTechnology Center - FASTC. Interesting how they keep changing names!Surprised, this admiral pushed back from the desk and asked, \"Are you serious?\"\"Yes, sir.\" Said Will.And then the Admiral asked, \"Well, is Dr. Greer serious? Is he credible?\"93And he said, \"Extremely credible, sir.\"So the Admiral said, “All right. I'll set it up.\"He called Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and said, \"I want you to meet withDr. Greer and his team.\"But the Base Commander said, \"We won't allow it.\"Eventually the Admiral ordered the head of Air Force Intelligence to make themeeting happen.That same week in September of 1993, I had been invited by Laurance Rockefellerto his \"JY\" ranch in the Tetons.So first I went out to Laurance's ranch. As it turns out, a number of peopleinvolved with this subject had been invited to the Ranch, many who were tiedinto the intelligence community.In addition, there was one of Rockefeller's chief aides, a wonderful man, whowas very supportive of our work. Also there was a 'woman in red', whom it turnedout had been in Laurance Rockefeller's circle for years. Her husband (I'll callhim Bruce) was on the boards of Morgan Stanley and many top transnationalcompanies and was also a CIA operative. (He told me this personally.) He alsohad been one of President Reagan's ambassadors.So into this interesting mix arrives this country doctor from North Carolina,who has been making contact with the ETs!At an early meeting, I explained that we were putting together a team of topmilitary insiders and evidence, and intended to disclose the matter to thepublic. You could have heard a pin drop in the room.They asked, \"You're going to do what?\" And, \"Who are you working with,\" and,\"What is going on?\"I said, \"Well, when I leave here I'm going straight to Wright-Patterson AirForce Base. There are covert military and intelligence factions that aresupportive of disclosure. I am not speculating on this.\" I was very forthcoming.\"Here's what we're going to do....\" It was clear people were stunned. It wasobvious that there were people at this meeting who were outraged at the prospectof a disclosure. I remember having a conversation in '92 with some of GeneralT.E.'s people who asked, \"If you make contact where it's a very large event thatgets televised, will you allow us to control it first before it gets out to thepublic?\" \"No, I won't.\" I said.Then they said, \"We control the media, and all the satellites they use; so wewill take control.\" To my disappointment, it was confirmed to me again by CBScott Jones that, ultimately, that it would, indeed, be controlled.Yet, I vowed, \"We're going to keep this as independent as is humanly possible.\"The JY Ranch is surrounded by Grand Teton National Park.94On the first day we were there, I was on a walk around the lake with twoprominent abduction researchers. I'll never forget how one of them (I'll callhim Mr. X) proceeded to inform me that he was a big advocate of hallucinogenicdrugs — that in fact at that very moment, he was on hallucinogenic drugs! Ofcourse, he was stumbling around the lake, falling over logs and I knew somethingwas not right!So here is this famous abduction researcher, who told me that his work involvedpeople whom he encouraged to take hallucinogenic drugs to \"help recall theirabduction and sexual experiences with aliens.\" !!!I thought, \"Oh, my God. So that's how that 'spin' is making its way into thepublic.\"Of course, I subsequently learned that Mr. X had deep connections to the MKUltra CIA program dating back to the 1950s and 60's. They were developing mindcontrol with the use of hallucinogenic drugs.There is a complete and utter infiltration of civilian ufology with people whoare operatives from covert, shadowy intelligence fields, and who are involved insome of the most bizarre mind control experiments, including high powered drugsmixed in with electronics and so-called psychotronic weapon systems.The truth is so much stranger than any fiction you will ever read.95"},{"pageContent":"14 DISINFORMATIONI was mortified to find Mr. X proudly admitting that he did this type of leadinghypnosis, at times so stoned on hallucinogenic drugs that he said, \"I can't getup off the couch to even get a cup of coffee. I have to have an assistant bringit to me.\"During these sessions he said that he would be leading his abductees underhypnosis and in an altered state of consciousness, where they would 'discover'their hidden alien experiences!I thought to myself, \"Mother of God. Here we have multi-hundred-thousand dollarbook deals and research programs funded by Rockefellers and Prince S. A.,foisted onto the gullible public. And all these things are presumed true due tothe stamp of this researcher!\"By 1993, therefore, it was obvious to me how elaborate the hoax was that wasbeing perpetrated on the public. And that 90-plus percent of the information inthe public domain on UFOs, extraterrestrials and encounters with ETs was allbogus disinformation- designed to scare the hell out of people.From 1993 until now, it has personally been very difficult for me to live withthis knowledge. I have held my fire concerning the corruption and the outrighthoaxing of information and experiences that are foisted on the mainstream publicthrough multi-million dollar disinformation campaigns related to UFOs andextraterrestrials.But suffice it to say that the entire field of UFO research is so mobbed up andso labyrinthine, that at least 90 percent of everything that has ever been putout in the public domain on this subject is complete fabrication and carefullytailored disinformation and psychological warfare programming.Mr. X and I had an interesting philosophical discussion, but it was difficult togo too far because of incoherence on his part from all of his drug use.What isn't known is that Mr. X is a major abuser of those substances and alsohas encouraged people who abused them to come forward and get in thisfolie-a-deux96-this conjoint madness to concoct alien encounters, and then rubber-stamp themas having actually happened.Now, one of the interesting things that was discussed was how he had been\"persecuted\" for doing this abduction research, and that he was some type ofvictim.In reality, what happened is that not only had he been doing drugs with hissubjects, but he had been doing something that is an absolute ethical no-no: Hehad been billing his research subjects for his time. In a research experiment,you can't charge the subjects. This is highly immoral and unethical.One of the things that I learned in the course of this meeting at the JY Ranchwith Laurance Rockefeller was that David Rockefeller, of Chase Manhattan Bankand Nelson, who had been US Vice President and had passed away, were very muchinvolved in the secret government. Laurance Rockefeller knew of these things buthe was really more of the philosopher king of the family and was not the powerguy. He was a professional philanthropist, who genuinely wanted to just giveaway his wealth before he died.Unfortunately, he had morally inept people surrounding him, including this nestof CIA people, not the least of which was the 'woman in red' whose husband wasCIA.So into this mess steps Laurance Rockefeller wanting to support gettinginformation out about this subject. But his money is intercepted by CIAoperatives and ne'er-do-wells and is funneled away into bogus abductionresearch, substance abuse, and all kinds of other craziness.One man in Laurence's circle specifically intercepted what would have been anenormous amount of funding for CSETI to have a CE5 Initiative professionallysupported, and took it into his own institute, so it could then be funneled backinto other clandestine operations.This I know for a personal fact.So Laurance had some very good intentions, but was surrounded by a circle thatwas infested with a number of intelligence operatives who were hell bent onkeeping his resources away from productive work.Their task was to open a toilet lid and put millions of dollars in it and thenflush it into the sewer. And that is what they did. I witnessed it firsthand,and it was a tragedy of the first order of magnitude.Eventually, Laurance Rockefeller's whole interest in this area got interceptedby this 'woman in red', whose ethics were appalling.Around this same time, we had put together a series of documents thatconstituted what is called \"The Best Available Evidence.\" In the spirit ofcollegiality, I shared this openly as a work-in-progress with Laurance and withother people.It turns out that the 'woman in red' intercepted it, took Laurance Rockefeller'sand one of CSETI’s stalwart97supporter's money and hired a writer within the UFO community. He then took it,rewrote it, put their name on it, copyrighted it and stole it from us. Later,when we tried to use it for further free and open briefings, she hired one ofthe biggest law firms in Washington and threatened to sue me! How nice... This,after they stole the concept, including the title of the entire document.Notwithstanding these issues, I developed a bond with Laurance. I had some verylovely times with him and his wonderful wife, Mary.I recall, towards the end of one evening, Laurance and I walked out onto awooden deck off from the lodge where we were meeting at his ranch. On this deckwas a statue of a Native American on horseback with headdress, arms outstretchedto the stars.We were looking up at the sky and talking.Laurence turned to me, and said, \"You realize that no aspect of life on earthwill be unchanged by this matter being disclosed, so profound and far-reachingare the implications.\"\"Yes, Laurance, that's why it's secret and that's why it has to happen.\" I said.\"But we need your help.\"\"I want to help.\" He said. \"But my family is already jumping up and down on myfeet because I'm involved this much!\"\"You still need to do the right thing here.\" I replied. \"It's much toodangerous.\" He said.\"Well, Laurance, my God, you're old, you're rich, and you're a Rockefeller!\"He replied, \"My hands are tied. But know this — you have to do it. Think of itthis way: It's like a flock of geese in a \"V\" formation, and you need to be uphere at the front breaking new territory, and we will be back here.\"\"Oh!\" I laughed, \"Yes, after I have broken all the resistance of the head wind.\"\"But I have to stay back here.\" He said. \"I can't be up there. The family won'thave it.\"So you have people like Laurance Rockefeller, who really wanted to do the rightthing- but he allowed his wings to be clipped by family loyalties, and wassurrounded by a mob of intelligence operatives and spooks who were hell bent onintercepting his interests, and making sure that whatever support he could give,went into the toilet.Many wonderful things happened, including the fact that we were able to puttogether briefing materials which Laurance Rockefeller used to personally briefBill and Hillary Clinton at the \"JY\" Ranch.98You may remember that the first couple of summers of the Clinton White House,the Clintons would spend vacations at the Rockefeller Ranch. Laurance gave theranch to Senator Jay Rockefeller from West Virginia, but it was still the familyranch. There, they were able discuss with Bill and Hillary Clinton theinformation we had assembled on the ET matter. Laurance was sincerely trying toget this information to the right people.I later found out from a friend of the Clinton's that when President Clintonreturned to the White House and was reviewing the briefing documents again heexclaimed —and she did a perfect impersonation of Bill Clinton— \" I know this isall true, but God damn it, they won't tell me a thing. Not a God damned thing !\"Later I was invited to go to a meeting in New York to give a presentation at thehome of a novelist named Judith Green, who had an apartment on Park Avenue.There was a large group of people present, including Mrs. Boutros Ghali,Rockefeller's representatives -- a whole group of people from high New YorkSociety were present.I spoke about contact with these life forms and what it would take to create apeaceful world here so that we could live in harmony with our extraterrestrialneighbors. My talk was very well-received and subsequently, I was able to meetwith Mrs. Boutros Ghali.It was disappointing, however, that some there had the misconceptions that arein rampant circulation in the mass media and UFO circles.Those who put out distorted research dealing with cattle mutilations, humanvivisection, alien rapes and encounters get enormous funding from the covertgroup and their friends and contacts in the disinformation arm. They control andspin disinformation to the mainstream media, the UFO public, and what I call the\"retail consumers of all things extraterrestrial\", who swallow hook, line andsinker their harvest of fear.They are very good at packaging it and seeing that only those aspects of the UFOsubculture that support the party line of fear get financial support, publicityetc. Now, unfortunately, blowing the whistle on that hasn't endeared me to somefolks, but the truth is, people need to know how clever this group is at dupingresearchers to put out disinformation.For example, many so-called abduction researchers receive leads to abductees bybeing tipped off by these shadowy groups and their contacts. Often these leadsare people who have been abducted in mind control experiments that are runcompletely by shadowy human paramilitary operations.The information out in the public on this subject is so polluted and corruptedwith disinformation and hoaxed events, that you really have to scrap it andstart all over.99This is not what I thought was true in 1990, but by 1993, I had heard it andseen it firsthand at the deepest and highest levels of the intelligencecommunity. As I met first-hand with these shadowy groups and figures, this wasno longer just a theory on my part, but became something I knew to be true.Unfortunately, I have had to live with a terrible burden of how much of this tosay to the public. We know it will create a firestorm of hatred against us bythe very machine that wants the world deceived. This huge disinformationcampaign puts out enough fool's gold that the truth- the kernel of real gold- isburied under a mountain of fool's gold. And most people aren't doing an assayand wouldn't even think to do one!So everyone is accepting fool's gold and mistaking it for the real thing. Why?Because the central operation of the past 40 or 50 years has set up false decoydatabases and decoy belief systems, to distract people from what's actuallytrue.This shadowy cabal forces into the civilian population completely concoctedpseudo- extraterrestrial events. Very advanced technologies are used so thatcovert programs can simulate an extraterrestrial event, an abduction, or acattle mutilation that looks like 'aliens' are invading. In reality, theoperation is being run out of a facility in New Mexico or Utah, using unmarkedhelicopters and specially trained people who swoop in and stage these hoaxedevents. This is carefully calibrated psychological warfare. The stakes areenormous. The propaganda purpose is very simple: Put out enough fearsome andscary information so that the operation can seed into the consciousness of themasses a back-of-the- mind fear of anything from outer space. Eventually thedeceived masses will be brainwashed enough to support armed conflict betweenplanets.It is all part of a preparatory or 'acclimation' disinformation and mind controlprogram. The public is being \"disinformed\" under the pretext of being\"informed.\" And there are willing and unwilling dupes within civilian UFOresearch who are part of this.Most of them are unwitting dupes. They don't even know they are being played.But who is doing this? It is not as direct as \"the government\" you learned aboutin civics class! What government? Which government? The Shadow Government- TheSecret Government.Is the secret shadow government directly controlling these things? It's evenmore subtle than that. Do they have agents within the civilian UFO world? Yes.Frighteningly, many of them.Equally scary is another way in which they achieve their purpose. By putting upenough believable disinformation and hoaxing enough events they are able topersuade researchers to accept these bogus events without question and thenreport100them to the public in various magazines and books. The vicious cycle continues-the public unthinkingly accepts these reports as reality.It is a complex issue, but it is very easy to fool people if they don't knowthere is a 'faux phenomenon' or false phenomenon paralleling the factual andactual extraterrestrial phenomenon. With unlimited funds and sophisticatedelectronics and technologies, it is easy for this rogue clandestine group to dothat.This group has enormous resources, while on the other side of the equation is apoorly funded, amateur, hobbyist UFO civilian community. It is like taking candyfrom a baby.This is a rule of thumb that you can go by: If there is a lot of money behindit, and if there is a lot of fearsome, scary, spooky almost demon- likeinformation associated with it, you can be assured that it is disinformationthat has wittingly or unwittingly been proffered to the public.Many people don't realize that in cases of, say, animal mutilations, the vastmajority have reports of unmarked helicopters and human commando styleoperations doing these \"events.\" This is well known in the research community,but these facts never get reported to the public. The event is always portrayedas an alien mutilation of our innocent livestock!Think about this. We have a public that loves to go down to McDonald's and eathamburgers. And this public is being informed that evil aliens are invading andtorturing our poor cows! Come on!There is a psychological warfare component to all this. The people who trade inthese scary scenarios find out quickly that if they go the direction ofnegativity, they get a lot of funding and grant supports from certain quarters.If they don't go negative, or if they begin to tell the truth, all theirfinancial support dries up.This is precisely why CSETI and the Disclosure Project has never had any seriousfunding. We refuse to lie about these things. We refuse to go negative. And werefuse to put out information that scares the hell out of the population.I have said publicly that if I were to write a book that said I had beenabducted and kidnapped, vivisected or sexually molested, by fearsomeextraterrestrials from Tau Epsilon, I could retire a very wealthy man. The bookadvances, the screen plays and the media deals would be extremely generous.That's the truth.Now, back to the story. I left the Rockefeller ranch and went directly to WrightPatterson Air Force Base with our military advisor and one other gentleman andmet with a Colonel Kanola and Bruce Ashcroft, a civilian intelligence officeralso considered a 'public information officer'.We did not go there to view the extraterrestrial bodies or material that hadbeen there since the 40s. The purpose of the visit was for me to do a briefingto them about what we were doing and how necessary it was for them to be ready101for change. You will remember how the Admiral at the Joint Chiefs of Staff hadordered the meeting, and actually had to pull rank with the head of Air ForceIntelligence to make it happen.The meeting went on for an hour or two, during which time I made a very clearcase regarding how we had established contact on numerous occasions with theUFOs in question. They were writing furiously as we disclosed this informationto them. We continued to explain that it was well past time for this informationto be disclosed to the public.At one point, the Colonel asked, \"Well, what if these life forms are hostile?\"I looked at him and I said, \"You know what? You and I wouldn't be having thisconversation if they were hostile given the fact that the technologies that theyhave are so advanced that they can alter the fabric of space-time. If they werehostile, in a nanosecond the earth could be turned into a cinder floatingthrough space and you know it. And insofar as we have been doing reckless anddangerous things against them for decades, the fact that you and I still arebreathing the free air of earth is abundant testimony to their non-violence.\"He just looked at me.We left briefing materials at Wright-Patterson AFB with these officials. Later,my military advisor was able to get into the computer system and see that allthese materials were accessible in the archives of Air Force Intelligence atWright Patterson. The CSETI contact events and our best available evidence andassessment of the situation were all there, in that computer system.But after the material began to be accessed by higher ups or their aides, itdisappeared. Our material was never seen again!A little postscript to this experience: Later we learned that Admiral Cramer wastold that he was not to be involved in this sort of meeting again. When ourmilitary advisor went back to visit the Admiral, his aide insisted, \"Don't everbring up that subject again with Admiral Cramer. He can't talk about that!\"Do you think that we should have been surprised to learn that, shortlyafterwards, he was promoted from being head of Intelligence Joint Staff, tobeing Director of Naval Intelligence - DNI?I was told that Admiral Cramer was rewarded for not pushing this issue anymore.Hence, the promotion up to DNI. The bitter irony here is that he was probablygiven more information about the subject after he was rewarded for dropping thesubject.102"},{"pageContent":"15 THE CROSSING POINT OF LIGHTBy the fall of 1993, I was on a very steep learning curve regarding how theshadow government had infiltrated not only the covert world and the governmentand corporations, but also the civilian media and the civilian UFO community.After the Rockefeller meeting and our briefings at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ireconnected with the man who was friends with CIA Director Woolsey. He wasconvinced that we needed to get this information, through a number of channels,to not only the President but other senior officials in the Administration. Wewere doing this through the President's science advisor, Rockefeller, and afriend of Bill Clinton who supported our effort. This man's brother was also inthe White House, and a very close associate of Bill Clinton's.We were approaching the powers that be in a friendly, helpful way, saying,\"Look, the time has come for disclosure to happen. The Cold War is over. Thereis a window of opportunity here, to disclose to the public, in a positive way,the fact that these extraterrestrial vehicles are real and that there areclassified projects that may have been justifiable during the pressures of theCold War, but are not justifiable any longer. Disclosure needs to happen now. Wehave a chance to make a break from the past.\"We were also saying, in the same breath: \"If you don't do it, we will. We'llfind a way to do it by collecting enough sources to make a convincing case.\"This is exactly what the Disclosure Project is.With this fresh impetus, we decided we needed to get further insight into theintelligence operations.James Woolsey was nominated and confirmed by the Senate in 1993, and now in ourstory this is September of '93, so he had not been in that position for verylong. We found out from our senior White House contacts that, in fact, thePresident, as well as the CIA Director, were trying to find out through channelswhat the truth was about this subject. We were also told that they were beingflat-out lied to.I have a letter that was Fed Ex'ed to me in the fall of 1993 by this CIADirector's friend,103saying that CIA Director Woolsey had made inquiries into the UFO matter andcould not find out anything about it and was being lied to. Further, they knewthey were being lied to! He told me that the CIA Director wanted me to come toWashington, and that I was going to be the first person to brief the CIADirector on this. Well, I thought that he had gone stark, raving, mad. I'mthinking, here I am, a country doctor in North Carolina. And I'm supposed to begoing to DC to meet with the Director of Central Intelligence on something thatis Spook Central? Right!To be honest with you, my initial reaction was that this had to be aprevarication. I viewed it as a cover story- that the CIA Director kneweverything and that he just wanted to find out what we knew and what we were upto. As it turned out I was wrong, and Woolsey and the President really were outof the loop.On December 13th, 1993, we went to Washington to meet with Woolsey. The coverstory was a dinner at his friend's house. It was the six of us, the threecouples: my wife and I, the CIA Director and his wife, who, happily, was thechief operating officer of the National Academy of Sciences (so we were able tokill two birds with one stone); his friend and his wife. Our hostess it turnedout, didn't know who was coming to dinner until the day of the event! Can youimagine? \"Honey, guess who's coming to dinner? Oh, the CIA Director and thisextraterrestrial expert, Dr. Greer.\" Wow. Can you imagine coming home andtelling your wife that?I remember arriving in the late afternoon at the CIA Director's friend's house,with Emily. I had a whole briefcase full of materials. We discussed what we weregoing to do, but I had no idea how long this meeting might be. We all knew thatthis was a very serious briefing for the CIA Director. He was being lied toabout the most important secret in the history of the world. Woolsey's wifearrived first by private vehicle, and then the CIA Director arrived via SecretService escort. After initial greetings and about ten minutes of going throughsome of the materials, documents, photographs, cases and so forth, the CIADirector said, \"Yes, I know these are real.\"It turns out that he and his wife had actually seen one of these UFOs years agoin New Hampshire, and so he didn't have any doubt that they existed. But what hewanted to know was: Why wasn't he being told anything? And were there anycurrent projects dealing with it? And why were the extraterrestrials here? Andwhat does all this mean?People often think that senior officials like that would be laughing up theirsleeve at this subject. But no! The man was visibly shaken. He was profoundlyupset that as CIA Director, something this important was being withheld from himand the President. He was extremely upset about it. At one point, I thought hewas actually going to break down and cry. I considered his reaction an entirelyappropriate response, given the gravity of the subject, and I was hopeful of theoutcome of the meeting.104The meeting that I thought might be half an hour or so, went on for nearly threehours. During that meeting, we discussed everything he wanted to know. And Itold him why the extraterrestrials were here, and I explained why this was beingkept secret. And I explained exactly what should be done to fix the problem.It was, I was acutely aware, a terrible responsibility to take on. I felt thegravity of this situation. I'm dealing with someone who is arguably one of themost powerful people in the world, and I find out the emperor has no clothes! Ifind out that information is lost in the system and being denied to people whoare running the most powerful country in the world. And then I find out they'renot running the country at all and that there's a Shadow Government that'sreally running the whole show, and that this is now being confirmed to me by asitting CIA Director.I went from being a complete skeptic -- that someone at that level of power andauthority would really be out of the loop -- to understanding how far out of theloop he was: And not just the CIA Director, but also the President. It was thenthat I realized the severity of the dysfunction within what we think is aconstitutional republic and a democratic type of government- to the point thatthere is flat-out lying to people at this level of constitutional authority andresponsibility. I doubted that the CIA Director, the President, and others whowere being denied access to these projects were being lied to.But, because now I have been with people like a sitting CIA Director and sittingmembers of the Senate Intelligence Committee and similar officials throughoutthe world, and seen their faces and their body language and their reactions, Ican assure you that things are not what big media tells you they are.I shared with Woolsey the information that these extraterrestrial beings werehere for peaceful purposes. I explained that many UFO sightings were of craftmade by covert programs in the United States and elsewhere- that thetechnologies behind these vehicles are very powerful and are in the wrong hands.I also made the point that this matter had to be brought under constitutionalcontrol and it could only be done by the President. As a weak back-up position,the Congress could do an investigation, but really, because of the structure ofthe executive branch and its supervisory and immediate control over the chain ofcommand, leadership had to come from the executive branch - the President.Toward the end of the meeting, I remember giving him a set of recommendationswhich we subsequently published. So here's the scene: I deliver the evidenceinto the hands of a sitting CIA Director, recommend what needs to be done todisclose this information, end the secrecy, and get this matter back underproper control and oversight. I'm naturally hoping for some action, but what heasked me was: \"How do we disclose that which we have no access to?\"105Disappointed, but still pressing the point, I said, \"You have to get control ofit. You have to insist on access.\" He just looked away. He knew what wasinvolved.During the time we sat down for our dinner, the CIA Director was sitting acrossfrom me, and his wife was next to him. The group was discussing all these issuesthat had been raised. Finally, Dr. Woolsey, the CIA Director's wife, asked \"Doyou know how these craft communicate across the vast distances of space?\"I remember going through a quick but agonizing inner gut check: Do I tell herthe truth and lose all credibility? Or do I tell her a lie or a sanitizedversion of the truth and maintain some respectability? And I thought, no, I'vegot to just tell her the truth, as far-out as the truth may sound.So I said, \"Look, these extraterrestrial civilizations have figured out thestructure of space and time and non-locality.\" I saw some puzzled looks and knewI had to explain in detail. \"It's like this, take our own galaxy, the Milky WayGalaxy, which is 100,000 light years or so across. A nearby star system might beone percent of the distance from us, which is 1,000 light years. Let's use thatas an example. Look, if you had to communicate to that star system, and it hadto return a reply, you'd have to say, 'Hi, how are you?' and they'd come backand say, ‘Fine, thank you very much; how are you doing?' -- just that exchangewould take 2,000 years! How and why? — a light year is the distance conventionalelectro- magnetic waves travel, at 186,000 miles a second, over the course of awhole year. So, 1,000 light years means it'd take 1,000 Earth years for us toget a message there and another 1,000 to get the message back. And that's onlyone percent of the distance across our own galaxy!\"\"The speed of light is just too damned slow,\" I continued. \"It's not a viablemeans of communication or travel when you start talking about inter-stellardistances. Quite frankly, it's barely sufficient, if you're not over the speedof light, to go around even our own solar system. This means that anycivilization that's gotten here has mastered those technologies and sciencesthat deal with everything beyond the speed of light-- what I call the crossingpoint of light. If they've mastered that, they have discovered this nexus whereelectromagnetism, matter, space, time and consciousness all come together.\" Itis, in fact, like the Moody Blues song - 'Thinking is the best way to travel'.I explained that these extraterrestrial civilizations have technology- assistedconsciousness systems, as well as consciousness-assisted technology, wherethere's an interface between mind and thought and a specialized physics andelectromagnetism. And so when they communicate, the message is communicated fromPoint A, say here on Earth, back to a home planet, Point B, 1,000 light yearsaway, in real time. That's because it has dropped out of linear space-time andhas crossed over into this non-local aspect of the universe.106This involves some very sophisticated physics but also encompasses the realms ofthought and of consciousness.They can think to a device or interface with a device, and it will instantly andaccurately convey that signal and that message to another point -- and this istechnological; it's not just 'telepathic'. The information and images aretransferred non-locally to another point in space, no matter how far away, inreal time. It is like two nodes, instantaneously resonating. The signal goesfrom one node to another, bypassing linear space-time.Dr. Woolsey looked at me and said, \"I thought it had to be something like that.\"She really did get it.When you're dealing with civilizations that are traveling through inter-stellardistances, it is crucial to realize that they have had to master the sciencesthat involve consciousness, thought, electromagnetism, and non-locality. Hence,the CSETI protocols have a component that deals with non-locality andconsciousness and directed coherent thought. This is because the ETs havetechnologies that pick up coherent and directed thought signals as clearly as wewould pick up an electromagnetic signal from a laser or a radio or cell phone.It is very scientific and very reproducible- it is a science not widely known onearth today.I think a lot of people can now understand this concept. Thankfully, there arenow enough people who have arrived at a post-quantum understanding of theUniverse.A number of people I've worked with who have been in covert aerospace andelectronics firms that deal with this subject have confirmed to me that we haveretrieved extraterrestrial communication devices that do exactly that: theyinterface with thought and consciousness and respond to thought andconsciousness. They are tuned to be able to do that.Well, the hours spent with the CIA Director and his wife were certainly eventfuland revealing. Toward the end of the evening, I sensed that he very muchappreciated the information and was very interested. But I also sensed theprofound tragedy and sadness in the moment when he asked me, \"How do we disclosesomething we don't have access to?\"- I realized then the enormity of thechallenge ahead of us. I recalled the dysfunction that we had been warned aboutby Eisenhower when he said, beware the military industrial complex and thethreat to our liberty and security by its excesses. What Eisenhower warned usabout had fully matured into a level of dysfunction that was of truly epicproportions and I was witnessing it firsthand.As we said goodbye I realized that the entire time we had been inside, the placehad been monitored; we saw there were Secret Service people out front. Ofcourse, they had a sag wagon and armed guards with earphones. The works!107In many ways, the encounter was traumatic for me - But I was grateful because Iwas able to learn the truth.108"},{"pageContent":"16 CIRCLES OF POWERIn 1993, before briefing the CIA Director, my contact for meetings at highlevels had suggested that we name our operation \"Project Starlight.\" So that iswhat it was called in the early days. The philosophy behind it was to assembleabsolutely the best evidence that was available, which had been rigorouslytested and proved and to identify military, corporate and intelligence witnessesto programs and events. Then, with an ironclad case in hand, we would brief thePresident, the intelligence and military community Congress, the United Nationsleadership, and other leaders around the world, in advance o/Disclosure.We knew it was crucial to, at the very least, give the system a chance. It'svery important to understand that our intention was not simply to go in like abull in a china shop and bring all this very sensitive information out, withoutfirst fully apprising the legal, legitimate leaders of the world and invitingtheir participation. At the time, many people thought I was being silly andnaive, that \"those people\" would never get behind something this controversial.But that's not the point! The point is, from our perspective, we had a moralresponsibility to at least give them an opportunity to do the right thing -andif they didn't do the right thing, then it would be on their consciences and notours.I felt strongly we had the obligation to give these leaders the currentassessment of the situation, and say to them, “You need to take a leadershiprole, if this is going to be accomplished by you and not by an outside group.\" -( meaning. The Disclosure Project and CSETI ). \"you have an ideal opportunitythat has opened after the end of the Cold War, to break the cycle ofmisinformation. To make a fresh start.\"After I met with the CIA Director, a contact set up a meeting between SenatorByrd's chief investigator and counsel for the Senate Appropriations Committeeand me. Sen. Byrd was then Chairman of the committee and very powerful. This manwas named Dick D'Amato not to be confused with Senator D'Amato from New JerseyDick D'Amato had a top secret clearance and had subpoena power from the SenateAppropriations Committee.109We met in the Senate Appropriations committee meeting room - a huge, ornate roomwith a giant table and brass nameplates for each member of the Committee. Heproceeded to tell me, \"I've been asked by Senator Byrd and some others to lookinto these things, and we've gotten close enough to know that these projects doexist. But I'm telling you that with a top secret clearance and a subpoena powerfrom the Senate Appropriations Committee, I cannot penetrate those projects.\" Helooked at me— I'll never forget it— and said, \"You're dealing with the varsityteam of all black projects, so watch out. And good luck.\" And that was the endof that.Dick D'Amato and people like him know this is real, but they cannot get theirhands around it or control the expenditures.Access to these projects has nothing to do with rank or position. Access has todo with whether or not you are willing to go along with the secrecy. That is theonly criterion that matters, whether you are willing to play along with theagenda.Those who shouldn't be in control but are, comprise an illegal, rogue break-offgroup that is trans-national and whose members are not only ruthless andmurderous but operating completely without any legal authority. When you'redealing with something as fundamentally important as this, involvingtechnologies as powerful as those described, you begin to realize the risks tothe world of allowing this masquerade to go on, unchecked, decade after decadeafter decade.In 1994, an FOB, a Friend of Bill Clinton, came to my home after I had briefedthe CIA Director. He was a very easygoing, affable guy. He said, \"You know,everyone agrees with what you're recommending, but there's a consensus that ifthe President does what you've suggested to him and to the CIA Director—thatthey exert executive power to get inside this operation and disclose it— thePresident will end up like Jack Kennedy.\"I thought he was joking, and to be honest with you, I laughed out loud. I trulythought, \"Oh, come on.\" But no, he was deadly serious. And he made it very clearthat he was serious.So it went from crisis to crisis, as I came to realize that the government ofthe United States -- and of every other nation -- was really hostage to anillegal, rogue group that had technologies that could do circles around a B-2Stealth bomber and could, at will, terminate a presidency or terminate any otherperson who got in their way. This was made very clear to me by people who werein the inner circle of the greatest corridors of power on Earth.Obviously, this weighed on me very heavily. I would say the period between '92and '98 -- those six years -- were extremely traumatic for me. I would keep mychin up and publicly keep moving forward, but on a deep personal level it110was devastating. I never lost faith in what we should do, but it was made veryclear to me that the task was enormous and that the hour was late and that thestakes could not be greater.In early 1994, I went back up to New York and spent some time with LauranceRockefeller. I also met with a number of other people in New York City who wereconnected to the United Nations and to other organizations. We were walking intovarious circles of power and putting this information in their hands. In a way,I became the cosmic hand-holder. I would sit with the wife of the SecretaryGeneral of the U.N. or a CIA Director or close friends of the President orsenior brass at the Pentagon and tell them what was going on and take themthrough this -- it's like the stages of death and dying, where they'd go fromdenial to anger and shock and grief and everything else. And this wasincreasingly what I found myself doing.In these circles of enormous power and wealth, all kinds of betrayals happen.Some of the people working with us would sell out to a cell within the ShadowGovernment that interfaces with the civilian UFO community that's headed up byColonel MK, General T.E., W.B. a very wealthy Nevada businessman and others.One such person went behind my back, and tried to defame me to Rockefeller'speople, to intercept money that Rockefeller wanted to use to support ourproject, to take into his own institute.So, here I am, working as an emergency physician, a very stressful job, raisingfour young children, and thrown into this nest of vipers. Traumatic doesn'tbegin to paint the picture! There were times when I really wanted to give up,but I knew I couldn't because I was still connected to the purpose and thevision of where we're headed. I tried to keep my sight on that far horizon—which isn't that far away in time, but seems very far away in events that haveto happen— where we can create the world of our dreams.And it was with that certainty, as well as faith, that I stayed in the effort.You have to understand the compartmented nature of these interlocking intereststhat are keeping all this secret: They are mainly in the corporate,institutional, financial, and technology sectors. The government of 'We, thePeople' is the least important component of it, and this includes the military,the CIA, the NSA, the NRO, Army intelligence, Air Force intelligence -- all ofthat is window dressing for an operation that's quite outside it. The realaction is a hybrid group that is quasi-governmental but mostly privatized andutterly trans-national - and completely illegal.Some of the chieftains of that group invited me to meet with them after I hadmet with the CIA Director. In advance of the meeting with the CIA Director, mycontact to Woolsey was terrified by the idea that anyone would find out about111the meeting. He was doing everything through FedEx, and he wanted me to talkwith him on the phone at telephone booths, talking in a code!I said, \"We don't need to bother doing that, because the group that we're upagainst have technologies that can frustrate any system you can devise.\" Well,he had been on the short list to be Clinton's Secretary of the Navy. So he knewthe spook world fairly well. But he had been in the conventional military andintelligence world. I knew what we were up against, but he didn't. So he said,\"Oh, no, we have to do this. You're just a doctor! I've been in all thesecircles, and we have to be careful.\" So I humored him.I tried to explain to him that there was no way to frustrate the surveillancecapabilities of this covert group, because they had non-local,'scalar' technologies that would enable them to bypass entire generations ofelectronics. Even the state-of-the-art NSA and NRO stuff is nothing compared towhat they have, because what they have are electronic interfaces withconsciousness, where they can monitor things in real time all the time. Well, hedidn't know this. I knew it and had remote-vie wed them remote-vie wing me.So I went along with his game. But before I had the meeting on December 13th,1993, someone who had been tied into these projects in the military in Arizonacame to me and said, \"I understand you're going to be meeting with Jim Woolsey,the CIA Director, about such and such on this date.\" I said, \"I won't confirm ordeny that, but isn't it interesting that you would comment on it?\"I reported this to my contact, and had to pull him off the ceiling! He wentballistic! \"How could this be found out?\" I said, \"MJ, you haven't beenlistening.\" The problem is: Most people are too arrogant to know what they don'tknow.I should also mention that during my visit to New York in the winter of 1994,while at the Hilton on Sixth Avenue in New York, I got a phone call from a\"reporter.\" And he said, \"I'm a free lance reporter for the 'Wall StreetJournal'.\" He said, \"I understand you had a meeting with Admiral Woolseyregarding UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence.\"He asked, \"What can you tell me about that?\" I didn't lie; I just asked arhetorical question: \"Do you really think a sitting CIA Director would meet witha country doctor from North Carolina about a subject like UFOs andextraterrestrials?\" And he said, \"Well, no, I guess not.\" And I said, \"Well,there you are,\" and I hung up. And that was the end of that. But this experiencerevealed to me that the media community was also mobbed up with intelligencepeople who were monitoring our activities.It was around this time, in early 1994, that a contract worker for the covertshadow group that had a cell within the CIA, called me and said, \"Look, wereally want to see you get this done. Hurry up.\" I said, \"What do you mean,'hurry up'?\"112They said, \"We've been wanting someone to appear who would do this for us; atleast a third of the people in this covert control group want to see this matterdisclosed, but we can't do it...\"I said, \"Well, who the hell do you think I am? I'm just a country doctor here inNorth Carolina. I barely have a pot to pee in!\" He said, \"Well, no, you don'tunderstand. We can only do things behind the scenes.\" I said, \"Oh, for God'ssakes!\"Eventually, he flew in and met with me at the Grove Park Inn, in Asheville. I'llnever forget what he said to me during this conversation, \"You know, if you wantto get a message to us or to the President, all you need to do is pick up thephone. Don't dial anything— just talk. Or if you prefer, just sit in your homeoffice and talk to the four walls. Because it's all being monitored in realtime.\" And I said, \"Yes, I know.\" And he asked, \"Well, how do you know that?\" Iproceeded to tell him how they had made errors and left their end of the hook ortap open a couple times. It happened to Emily, and it's happened to me.Once when I picked up the home phone to make a call, I heard a control room onthe line. I could hear people talking, instead of a dial tone. So I asked, \"Whois this?\" Then a woman with a very thick foreign accent but speaking properEnglish says, \"Oh, my God, it's Mr. Greer.\" And I said, \"Dr. Greer to you,bitch.\" And hung up! In those days, I was outraged by these things. Now, I couldcare less.So, I told this man, \"Yes, I'm sure that's true.\" He said, \"But, you know, thisreally does need to happen.\" I said, \"But why don't you do it?\" And he said,\"Oh, no, it's too dangerous.\" He said exactly what Laurance Rockefeller had saidto me in September, standing out on his deck under the stars.By now you see a theme that keeps repeating: There are extremely well-connectedpeople who are on the inside and who want to see disclosure, but they'reterrified of the rogue, violent group.After this meeting, I got an invitation from a group of rogue insiders to go toPhoenix in the winter of 1994. The meeting of was at the Wrigley Mansion— theold, fabulous mansion that the Wrigley chewing gum family had built. It had beentaken over by a cell within this covert group. Present were a number of shadowycorporate people. It was a very late night meeting.A prominent industrialist who was involved with this cell was kept on drugs andwas kept under some kind of mind control while this cell milked him of hismoney. They then used his money to support this particular operation. Themethods and motives of this group are beyond dark. I tell people: More than 10or 15 percent of what I have seen and learned you don't want to hear - It's sodamned disturbing, most people would commit suicide. And many people have, bythe way.We all gathered around a conference table in the Wrigley mansion. The discussionwas about disclosing UFO information and making contact with ETs.113One man, during a break, took me out onto a balcony and said, \"You know, weunderstand you've had this meeting with the CIA Director and are providinginformation to the President, but you need to know that those people don't knowanything, and they're never going to know anything. You should understand that-- well, you should be talking to people like us. The people dealing with thisare people who do a lot of contract work for the government, under \"Work ForOthers\" -\"WFO\" - contracts. And you should be talking to certain think tanks.And you should be talking to certain religious orders and certain orders ofJesuit priests who have control over the technology transfer. And you should betalking to ...\" He gave me a whole list.Well, I thought the man had certainly gone 'round the bend'. But it turned outthat every single word he said was true—it all was confirmed in the followingmonths.It gets more bizarre. This group or cell within the Shadow Government wasattempting to intercept what we were doing. Remember, now, this is '94. A formerhead of Army intelligence- a member of that group - had offered me a board seatin '92. So, things are progressing, and I'm not straying from my course, becausethat's how I am.So this man said, \"We can really help you.\" I asked, \"What do you mean?\" Hesaid, \"Well, you know, if you want to be supported in this, just let us helpyou.\" I said, \"How do you intend to help us?\" \"Well, you're a doctor, right? So,you have really good credit. We've checked this out.\" And I said, \"Oh, yes, thebest.\"He said, \"Well, we know you have platinum cards and gold cards. Just maximizeall of them, every month: $50,000, $100,000, whatever. Get as many of them asyou want. And give us the numbers. And since we run all the super computers thatback up and monitor the banking system of the world, we'll simply erase thoseaccount balances to zero, as paid each month.\" This is a true story. I'm tellingyou, every word is true. Put me under any drug; hook me up to any machine. WhatI'm telling you is true.I said, \"Yes, but then if I did that, you'd own my ass, wouldn't you?\" He justhad a twinkle in his eye.I was much too wise to take that bait, tempting as it was -- this has been anenormous financial strain and struggle for those of us trying to do this withvirtually no funding. But no way was I going to do that!Then he said, \"I understand you're going to Europe soon to meet with certainpeople connected to the British royal family\" —which I was. He knew everything Iwas doing! And I said, \"Well, that's true.\" He said, \"It so happens that, I'mgoing to be over there meeting with the Rothschilds and the people who controlthe Volvo Corporation and some of the other big industrial concerns, becausethey're working with us.\"114I said, \"Oh, I'm quite sure that's true.\" He suggested, \"Let's rendezvous whilewe're in London together.\" I said, \"Okay, that's fine.\"He proceeded to tell me, \"One of my friends, who's really interested in whatyou're doing, is one of the leaders of the Council on Foreign Relations,Ambassador Maxwell Rabb. Would you like to come to a meeting with him?\" I said,\"Well, sure, if he wants to help us.\" And then he said, \"And also, thePetersons\" — Mr. Peterson was head of the Council on Foreign Relations and hiswife was head of the Tri-Lateral Commission -- are also working with me, andmaybe we can get together with them.\" So I said, \"When we have our next event,I'll invite them.\" He said, \"You need to know that all these people are readingwhat you write and are very interested in all of this.\" And I said, \"I knowthat.\" Look, everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time. I view all humansas educable. And everyone has a role to play in this whole cosmic drama. Butthis shadowy contact was essentially, again, inviting me into the inner leadingcircle of the cabal. While I had no intention of being controlled by them, Ihave no problem sharing perspective and knowledge with them.He also said that there were many top people that he worked with in the mediaand that his group worked with Bono and U2, the Moody Blues, Pink Floyd andvarious other groups. And they were receiving what I was writing. And I justsaid, \"Well, I appreciate that.\" He said, \"They love what you are saying anddoing...\"Later that winter, I went to Europe and met with some very good friends ofPrince Charles and Prince Philip. One of Prince Charles' best friends is verysupportive of the work we are doing.She wanted to receive some of the materials that I had put together for the CIADirector and the President, so she could share them with Prince Charles andothers. But remember, I'm squeezing this in between my emergency shifts. Iliterally, at times, went over to Europe for two or three days at a time, andwould come back and have to work a 24-hour shift in the emergency department!In a sense, it was our own little shuttle diplomacy operation. I did meet withthis shadowy Phoenix contact in London. He was still in the mode of courting meinto his operations. So I would listen and learn, - but never capitulate: Thisgroup is the largest Mafiosi and organized criminal enterprise on the planet.115"},{"pageContent":"17 LEGACIES LOSTWhen some people hear this story, they're horrified that I would be so willingto walk into the belly of the beast. But I say, \"Well, why not?\" I have noproblem meeting with anyone on Earth to share the vision of the good future ofthe human race and what we need to do to get there. I have no fear - and I knowthey cannot corrupt me. They can't buy me. They can't deceive me. And I don'tcare if they kill me. So, what's to be lost? If you stay in the truth, it allbecomes very simple. And there's no one you have to avoid, and the ones you needto seek are all open to you.I have learned that we need to operate on multiple tracks of consciousness atonce. It's like how dolphins operate -- they can be \"asleep,\" but part of theirbrain is also awake. This is scientifically proven. They are operating onmultiple levels and dimensions at once. Well, humans can do this, too. Duringthis period, I would go to sleep - but there would be a part of me that wouldawaken. For example, right after President Clinton got elected in late '92, Iwas with him on an astral level at the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock,Arkansas, discussing this knowledge - and this continued through his presidency.Meetings would happen on an astral level and sharing would take place. Yearslater, a good friend of President Clinton said that he was very much in touchwith that inner spiritual level and could meet that way I have done thisroutinely with people for many years. If we go beyond our own egos and fear andprejudices, we can do this and reach people spiritually.Now, it doesn't mean that those whom we reach — whether in a face-to-face,physical meeting or through these other, non-local applications of consciousness— are going to necessarily respond favorably. In the case of Bill Clinton, hevery much wanted to see this happen but didn't have the courage to do it. Hislegacy was basically lost, because it was his responsibility, as the firstfull-term president after the close of the Cold War era, to have done this. Hedidn't rise to the challenge. About the time that I was going to let it be knownthat I had had these meetings with the CIA director, after he had left office --I think he was there till '95 —I was visiting friends in Santa Barbara.116I was being interviewed by a major New York paper, and they were going to runthe story about our briefings for the White House and CIA Director on UFOs. Thevery day they were going to run that story, Linda Tripp emerged with her storiesabout Monica Lewinsky. That was not an accident or a coincidence. It knocked allthis off the radar screen of the media. And for the next couple of years, it was24 hours a day, seven days a week: the blow job heard round the world! Whatutter nonsense!News flash: The best aphrodisiac is power. And powerful men have affairs. Andguess what? Married men who have affairs sometimes lie about them. Gee whiz. Animpeachment proceeding based on this? Give me a break. Hilary Clinton was rightwhen she said there was a conspiracy to assassinate Bill Clinton by characterassassination instead of with a bullet. She was absolutely correct - and it wasover this and related issues.By the mid-'90s, I concluded that the President of the United States was notgoing to deal with the UFO problem and that, if he looked into it much further,it would be the end of his presidency.It was around this time that I met a good friend of President Carter who told methat Carter, in his early days as President and during the transition into hispresidency, tried to find out about the entire covert UFO matter. Carter had aUFO sighting in Georgia when he was governor, and we have his official report.So Carter tried to get a briefing from then-CIA Director George Bush - thecurrent President's father — but Bush told him he would not give him thatinformation and he should get it elsewhere! Later, as Carter pushed further onthis, he was visited by \"a suit,\" who said, \"Sir, if you would like to completeyour first term as President, you will keep your God-damned mouth shut aboutthis UFO matter.\" This insider and friend of Carter's told me that he andperhaps his family- were directly threatened.We learned from separate sources, including some Disclosure Project witnesses,that Jimmy Carter wanted to do a White House study on UFOs and that it was goingto be done through SRI (Stanford Research Institute). Pentagon covert projectsthen told SRI that they would pull all of their contracts supporting SRI if theywere to proceed with the Carter White House request to look into UFOs. So thestudy idea was buried. This is just part of a long pattern, going back to atleast Eisenhower, of United States Presidents being threatened — and in the caseof Jack Kennedy, being assassinated. Others have had their entire lives andpresidency threatened if they push this issue. So this is the mother of allcosmic buzz saws that I walked into between 1992 and now.Bill Clinton didn't have the courage to do it. But I believe, quite frankly, hecould have. Doesn't our public expect our leaders to be willing to go thedistance regardless of their own personal ambition or their own personal safety?117Most politicians are not courageous. We have a weak and spineless ruling classthat is intoxicated on money, power, and selfish ambition. So even when theyfind out about these issues, they don't have the backbone and stamina to do theright thing on behalf of the Earth, the Earth's people, or even the citizens ofthe United States.Between 1994 and 1997, as we continued to work the system, I decided it was veryimportant to reach out to the legislative bodies of the world. If the President,as a single person, was too terrified, and too threatened to act, and his innercircle was being denied access to information, then the next best venue wasCongress. So many senior White House officials were being denied access that itwas clear only an open hearing in Congress could change things officially.Regarding other senior officials being blocked: Astronaut Gordon Cooperpersonally told me that Secretary of Defense Cohen had learned of GordonCooper's team filming a landed UFO at a dry lake bed at Edwards Air Force basein the 1950s. Cohen tried to get access to that information but was deniedaccess. Cohen knew the dates and details of the landing and filming - and yetCohen could not gain access to the film or the records!So, we met with a number of members of Congress, including a member of theSenate Intelligence Committee, Senator Dick Bryan, of Nevada -- home to Area 51-- and others who were in key positions. As we networked, we found we could meetprivately with a number of key Congressmen. We presented the evidence and askedthem: \"Please sponsor open hearings at which these top -secret witnesses cantestify before a committee of Congress with the world news media present.\"What I found in almost every case is that they all wanted to know, but theydidn't want to act. I'll never forget being picked up by one of these littlegolf cart type vehicles at McCarran Airport in Las Vegas. I flew in just for afew hours to meet with Senator Bryan of Nevada during the mid '90s. We arrivedat what looked like a janitor's closet with a nondescript door -- when youopened it, you entered a beautiful conference room! It was used for these typesof VIP meetings at the airport. I was escorted into the room, and then theSenator came in. We spent about an hour together.Senator Bryan had an aide with him who sat on the couch. The Senator and I andmy escort were at the conference table. I don't believe the aide at firstunderstood what the meeting was about! The Senator asked, \"Well, who have youmet with to-date?\" and I said, \"The CIA Director and this person at the JointStaff, and . . . .\" I saw the aide drop the paper he was nonchalantly reading!He looked like someone had punched him.As the briefing proceeded, Senator Bryan said he had no doubt these matters118were real and ongoing, but that he had never been allowed access to thatinformation. This, from the mouth of a senior member of the Senate SelectCommittee on Intelligence! I then said, \"You know, we desperately need forsomeone like you to hold open hearings on this subject, much as Gerald Ford hadin the late '60s...\"As soon as I said that, he changed from being extremely engaged to being verydefensive. He said, \"Well, you've met with all these people. Why doesn't thePresident do it?\" I said, \"I think you must know why the President won't. Thisis really a big nut to crack.\" And he said, \"Well, I'm just a senator.\" I said,\"Well, I'm just a doctor!\"You took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States,and I am giving you evidence that the Constitution of the United States has beensubverted, that the chain of command has been decapitated, that the Congress hasbeen kicked to the curb, and that the most important technologies andinformation in the history of the human race are being managed by a rogue,illegal group. If this doesn't necessitate an inquiry by the Congress, whatdoes?!\" He sat impassively for a moment then said, \" I don't know if I can dothat, but have you spoken to John Warner on Armed Services?\" I said with all thepassion I could muster, \"Sir, I'm speaking to you.\" I was trying to not let himwiggle off the hook! But it was clear that Senator Bryan was just terrified atthe thought of pursuing the matter.We went through this same process with numerous members of Congress, the Senate,the executive branch, the military, the United Nations, and others - with noaction being taken. Eventually I was invited by a group at the United Nations togive a lecture there. The title of my talk was: \"The Foundations ofInterplanetary Peace.\" If you look in the papers in my first book, there is achapter by that title. The paper was written because I was asked to give thispresentation at the U.N. Most people don't realize that almost everything I'vewritten has been in response to a request from a group interested in knowing thetruth. This type of process has been the catalyst for the creation of my earlierbooks.I took one of my daughters who was 12 at the time to this meeting at the UN. Wearrived at the main entrance, where visitors go in. As we were waiting in lineto go through security, I suddenly heard an enormous commotion in the lobby. Ilooked over, and there was the wife of the Secretary General of the UnitedNations, with the Chief of Protocol and Security and a whole entourage,motioning for me to come over. So they came over and opened up the rope, and wewent through and bypassed security. We exchanged greetings and Mrs.Boutros-Ghali took my left arm, and I had my daughter's arm on my right. As thiswhole entourage is walking through the great entrance hall of the UN, Mrs.Boutros-Ghali turned to me and asked, \"When are you going to get this done?\" Isaid, \"What do you mean?\"119And she said, \"Well, this information that we are not alone has to get out tothe world.\" I said, \"Well, Leah, you and your husband are the head of the world!You're the head of the United Nations. I'm only a country doctor from NorthCarolina.\" And she said, \"Oh, no. It's too dangerous for Boutros. They'll killBoutros!\" And I thought to myself, \"What am I? Chopped liver?\" And of course,the answer is yes, I am just that. I'm cannon fodder— this is true. I'm theexpendable one in these circles -- that was made very clear to me from '92onwards.So, I said, \"You know, I can only do so much, Leah.\" She was among the mostpowerful women I've ever met. She had an enormous presence and was veryspiritual and had great insight.We requested that the long awaited Disclosure event take place at the U.N. Theyagreed to that. But around the time that the agreement was made, they usheredBoutros-Ghali out. Normally, the Secretary Generals get two terms. He only hadone. They cited all sorts of reasons why they had to get rid of him, just likethey got rid of Kurt Waldheim. And as it turns out, Kurt Waldheim had supportedcreating the Office of Outer Space Affairs, which does exist at the U.N., movingthe office's headquarters out of New York to Europe where it could really lookinto these issues. But they axed him over this - and brought out the Naziallegations against him. Boutros-Ghali was looking into these UFO issues, andthey axed him.So in comes Kofi Annan. A senior aide to Kofi Annan— a Korean who was thehighest diplomat in the United Nations bureaucracy from Korea— reached out tous. He said, \"They have agreed to let us have the big hall, at the UnitedNations, to host these top military and government witnesses to UFOs for aconference\". This was agreed to.But a few weeks later, this ambassador called me and said, \"Never call me againat the United Nations. Here is my home number.\" He'd become interested becausehe'd been aware of some extraordinary UFO events that were happening in Korea. Iwas shocked. I asked, \"What are you talking about?\" He said, \"Well, I know we'veagreed to host this for you, but it can no longer happen. The Secretary Generalwas visited by some people who showed him documents that so scared him that heknew he couldn't do anything more with this.\" I was told that the U.N., whichwas almost bankrupt, would have been shut down and closed! Essentially, theseintelligence operatives and trans-national rogues threatened the UN leadershipand put the fear of God in them.A lot of my life has been wonderful—but dealing with the Shadow Government hasbeen very disturbing. So disturbing that at times I have had to just let it allhang out with whoever is there. For example, one time I was meeting with a bunchof spooks in California who were associated with an Air Force base nearSacramento.120It was an intense time and I thought, \"Well, you know, I'm just going to gosomewhere and have a drink and be quiet.\"A man, I'll call him George, sat down beside me on a stool and starting talking.I was in no mood to talk, but he wanted to chat and asked, \"What are you doingin town?\"\"I'm quite sure you don't want to know.\" I said.\"Well, actually, I do.\" George said, munching on peanuts.\"Well, I've been here meeting with some people.\" I responded. \"Well, what do youdo?\" He asked.I said, \"I'm an emergency physician, but that's not why I'm here.\" \"Well, whyare you here?\" He asked,And so I said, \"You'll be sorry, but I'll tell you!\" So I proceeded to do amassive brain dump into this poor soul. I told him everything I've shared withyou, and more. I told him the name of every operative, every spook, everycorporation, who'd been murdered, what cell killed Jack Kennedy, who was part ofthat cell that I've met with—I mean, the whole damned thing. You know, it feltgreat to get all that off my chest, but he looked like he'd been run over by afreight train! And I said, \"Well, I told you I didn't think you wanted to hearthis.\"George asked, \"How in the world can you be telling me all this?\" I said,\"Because I'm nobody. I'm not under any security classification.\" Intrigued, heasked, \"Well, how do you know this stuff?\" I said, \"You don't even want to knowthat.\"In a sense, this chance meeting was hilarious. \"Well, let me buy you a beer.\" Isaid. \"This has been very therapeutic for me.\"He asked, \"Well, what if I called up Dan Rather and told him all this?\" I said,\"You think that that spineless shill at CBS would report this?\" \"Good luck.\" Isaid. \"I know for a personal fact that Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes was givensmoking gun evidence on this, years ago. Bob Schwartz, who was on the board ofTime-Life and was a noted journalist, was friends with Mike Wallace and hadgiven him the original MJ-12 documents. Wallace had vowed to do an expose onthis; but it was killed— and he didn't have the guts to stand down the corporatewhores at CBS to do the story.\" ,\"So, who are you going to go to that's going to get this out?\"\"You're acting as if we have a free press, and we don't -- and haven't had onefor decades.\" I said.In the spring and summer of 1994, I started reaching out to some other folks whowere involved in overseas operations related to UFOs. And one of them was S.A.,a crown prince.A friend of his, who was also interested in what we were doing and was verysupportive, suggested that I talk to him and felt that we should get together.Prince S.121A. was also friends with Laurance Rockefeller, and as it turned out, had beenpulled into the Col. MK / General T.E. / W.B. shadow cell operating here in theUnited States.Well, after we spoke on the phone, I received a personal letter from PrinceS.A., saying \"I think what you're trying to do is very noble. However, I don'tbelieve you will be allowed to do it, and I need to speak with you about this.\"He didn't want to talk about it on the phone. He wanted to meet.So, we met in July of 1994. He was in New York City, staying at the Four SeasonsPierre Hotel, which is on Fifth Avenue near Central Park, not far from LauranceRockefeller's home. So, I went to New York with one of our daughters.You have to understand, I took my daughters everywhere. We had what were called\"Dates with Daddy.\" My life being what it was, I needed to involve them. It waswonderful having time with each one alone, so we would take these special trips.So, we went to the hotel to meet the Prince. He is very elegant, courteous andfriendly. While my daughter played quietly in a corner, we had a private meetingto discuss the entire UFO matter.After a time, he finally got to what he wanted to say to me in the letter butdidn't want to write or say on the telephone. The Prince said, \"You know, youwon't be allowed to do this disclosure.\" I said, \"Oh, why is that?\" He says,\"You won't be allowed to, but not because of what you think.\" He said, \"Thealiens won't let you.\" I said, \"Really?\"Well, it turns out the Prince's brother had been abducted by what he thoughtwere aliens. But the Prince did not know that the abduction was done by a covertparamilitary operation. This was investigated by a NASA researcher who I'veworked with for years but who doesn't know that I learned that this NASAresearcher is part of the shadow government and is an eschatological,fundamentalist, end-of-the-world Christian. He interfaces in the UFO world as anobjective scientist investigating serious UFO phenomenon, but that is not hisreal role. This particular NASA scientist told me that the Prince's brother hadbeen abducted from the castle in his country.Now, what he didn't know is that I have a source inside the covert paramilitaryoperations who do abductions who told me that, \"Yes, of course, we abducted himso that this particular powerful family and the banking empire would be on boardwith our program to fight the aliens.\" Prince S.A. told me theseextraterrestrials had been the cause of every conflict on Earth since Adam andEve and that they were the ones enforcing the secrecy! I asked, \"Really? Why doyou think they appear over us with dozens of witnesses, interacting andsignaling to us and appear over major cities of the world, if they're wanting tobe so secret?\"122He had no answer for that. I said, \"I have to disagree with you. I think it is avery human group that wants to keep this secret, because to disclose it wouldmean the end of the entire centralized power system that exists, all fossilfuels, and the entire paradigm of anthropocentric religiosity.\"We had a frank but courteous exchange of ideas, and then we agreed to disagree.It was clear that the Prince viewed the ET presence as something to fear andhate - and that he supported military action against them.But in the course of this, he told me, \"President Bush(Senior) wanted to dothis, as well. Around the time of the end of the Cold War, a group that I wasinvolved with that included Gorbachev, President Bush, the United NationsSecretary General, Perez de Cuellar, were meeting to plan the release of thisinformation to the public.\" This was in 1989. He said, \"But one night, during alate night planning session in New York, the Secretary General of the UnitedNations, Perez de Cuellar was coming back from a meeting where the plans werebeing put in place to make this announcement about ETs, and a UFO appeared,stopped his motorcade, and abducted him out of the limousine! They took him onboard the craft, and told him that if they didn't stop this plan to disclose theextraterrestrial presence, that every world leader involved, including theUnited States President, would be abducted and taken off this planet and thatthey would stop the process!\"This is the famous case where an abduction researcher talks about a majorinternational figure being abducted, along with a civilian who witnessed it.What they didn't know is that I knew people in the cell operating the alienreproduction vehicles and the psychotronic weapons systems that were set up andconducted this abduction. In fact, a relative of the infamous red-headedsergeant at Roswell who threatened everyone, was there to coordinate the event.He was inserted as part of the security detail for the Secretary General, and heset up the electronics at the site of the Secretary General's motorcade, so thatthis late night pseudo- abduction of the U.N. Secretary General could takeplace.The goal of the operation was to stop this entire attempt by the world's powerelites, including Gorbachev, to disclose the truth to the world.Now, Prince S.A. really thought it was an alien abduction, just like he thoughthis brother was abducted by aliens. He didn't know that those abduction eventsare paramilitary operations run by humans, using things that look like UFOs andeven having creatures on board that look like extraterrestrials but are eitherdisguised humans or manmade creatures.This is called 'stagecraft', and I have a document that describes theseoperations. It is from one of the private institutes involved in the simulationof alien abductions. This has gone so far that they have engaged in theabduction of world leaders123to try to cause them to hate extraterrestrials and support Star Wars. It alsoconvinces these leaders to shut down any effort to get the information out.124"},{"pageContent":"18 ASTRAL BODY EXTRACTIONSWhen the Prince told me about the effort being stopped, I realized how seriousand maniacal and — I hate to use this word evil the Shadow Government is. Soutterly drunk on power are they that they're willing to do anything andeverything to keep this secret.I told the Prince I was quite certain that, since we had had open contact withextraterrestrial beings and our information was the opposite of what he wassaying, that he had been the target of disinformation.We had a casual conversation about the CE-5 Initiative, and he expressed aninterest in CSETI. What he said next was very insightful, \"You know, I've goneall over the world where these UFOs are being reported, and they will havesightings before I arrive and they will come back after I leave, but while I'mthere, they're never around. I wonder if it's because of my attitude.\"\"Well, Your Highness, \"I said, \"with all due respect, I believe you've hit thenail on the head. We have found that if one is free of prejudice, open-minded,and willing to engage with these extraterrestrial beings in a completelypure-hearted way that they will be there. And they will interact.\"Piggybacking onto this meeting, of course, was this covert group, monitoringevery minute of it. That night my daughter and I went back to our hotel, the St.Moritz on Central Park South, right across from Central Park.After falling fast asleep, I awakened hours later. I couldn't raise my anus; Icouldn't roll over; I couldn't move! I was in a state of complete physicalparalysis. I knew what was going on; a directional electromagnetic weaponssystem hit me. It was coming through the window above my bed. Projected into theroom was the single most extreme sense of evil and terror I've ever felt in mylife. I could tell they were attempting to extract my astral body out of myphysical body. (This is what most pseudo-abductions are, by the way - astralbody extractions.)The Shadow Government was showing me that they meant business and were preparedto abduct me. They were trying to convince me, as they had the Prince,125that I should hate and fear 'aliens'. They wanted to convince me that the alienswere evil; that they were from Satan; that we needed a holy war against them.They were attempting to convince me by teaching me a very hard lesson.But I knew this was man-made. The only thing I could do was turn to God. I heldonto the hem of the robe of God. I went into a state of transcendentalconsciousness and God consciousness, and as I did so, my individualitydisappeared into the Infinite- and this violent group lost their hold on me.Once in the Unbounded, this system could no longer hold me. There was no \"me\"there; you see what I'm saying? \"Leave thyself behind and then walk upon thewater.\" Be as nothing, and then be everywhere. I have told people who are beingtargeted with these systems, \"The only way to escape them is to understand thepower of transcending self and letting the drop of your individuality merge withthe ocean of Unbounded-ness.\"But as soon as I re-emerged into my individuality and consciousness, the attackwould begin all over again. It was one of the worst things I've everexperienced. They were clearly trying to grab my individuality, extract myastral being, and put me through their abduction sequence. Now, remember, if youcause enough trauma to the astral body, it can manifest in the physical. This issomething many people don't understand. Most of these abduction events areactualized by technologies that can extract the astral body from the physicalbody.Project Amethyst, run by a black cell at the NSA, killed people by severing thecord between the astral body and the physical body. I know a guy who ran thatprogram.This experience was, in a way, a gift -- because they tipped their hand and theyshowed me exactly what they had done to the Secretary General and what they haddone to the brother of Prince S.A.. I was then able to remote view back throughthis electronic beam and see the people in the facility -- all human -- thatwere running it. You see, anything that comes at you -- if you stay calm andcentered and in this transcendental state of consciousness— you can track backto its source and expose them. So, every time they've hit me, that's what I'vedone. And that's how I've seen what they're doing.I have to admit, this was one of the most difficult things I have had to do --to stay in control of my own faculties while this was happening, so I couldquickly escape the bounds of relativity, enter into the plane of the Absolute,where they couldn't get me -- because I didn't exist anymore.My daughter, thank God, was protected from all this and had no knowledge of anyof it. So, that was our little trip to New York!I have independently confirmed that some of the mid-level apparatchiks of thiscovert, shadow group -- which include a former US President — were in favor ofdisclosing this information in the late 1980s.126But there was another group that trumped them—— and it is a faction within thislarger control group. This cell has the abduction technologies, and they havethe scalar psychotronic weapons systems and radionic weapons systems. They alsohave the ARVs- Alien Reproduction Vehicles- that look like UFOs and operate withnew energy and anti-gravity propulsion systems.This cell uses these advanced technologies to contain disclosure on an officiallevel— up to and including threatening the leadership of the world and abductinga world leader, like a Secretary General of the United Nations.After this near pseudo-abduction experience in New York, I recalled a luciddream I had around 1990-1991. In the dream, I was floating above Kennebunkport,Maine and saw something that was really very disturbing. I saw the United StatesPresident, George Bush, at his compound there. There were objects in the skythat looked like UFOs, but were actually manned by paramilitary rogue elements.They were flying around the compound, and out at sea, and were threatening theU.S. President. The Secret Service and George Bush were very worried about this.It made no sense to me at the time that I saw it. But after this meeting, whereI learned what the Prince told me about the abduction of Perez de Cuellar, Iunderstood who was doing it and why.I also realized that, at the end of the Cold War, there was a sincere attempt toget this information out to the public, and that this cell within a cell withina cell -- this rogue, violent, and very dangerous group -- had stopped it. Thatwas in late '89. And it was January of '90 that I was told to \"pick up thatwhich I had dropped.\" Even though, to the rogue group I am an insignificantperson and have no temporal power or official position, because officialdom gotstopped dead in its tracks, mysteriously, somehow I was being called to help.People like Col. MK, who is known as Dr. Death and has a PhD in thananology, thestudy of death, are masters of psychotronics and high- tech electronic systemsthat are responsible for abductions, mind control, and similar attacks. So, whenyou realize what our leaders are up against— it doesn't matter if they're Skulland Bones, and it doesn't matter if they're a former CIA Director -- if they tryto step out of line, they run into this other group. This inner high cabal ishell bent on keeping this subject tied up until there is a worst case scenario.Their objective is the elimination of at least four to five billion of the sixbillion people on Earth.After returning from this event in New York in 1994,I experienced the horrifyingforce of the Shadow Government. Every night at 4:20 a.m., as I was sleeping inmy bedroom at home, there would be an almost sub-audible click, and I would behit with an electronic weapons system. I would become violently ill and so sickthat I would get up and be nauseated, vomiting, with diarrhea, diaphoretic. Thebath-127room floor would literally be soaked with sweat, because I had almost no bloodpressure, and I would collapse on the floor of the bedroom, near death. Thishappened to me night after night after night, day after day. It was horrifying.It lasted for only 10 or 15 minutes. I know that this rogue group was trying tomake me stop what I was doing—but I refused to stop.During this period, I remember one night going to sleep and suddenly seeingsomeone with this group at an electronic control panel. It was an array ofpsychotronic and radionic high-tech equipment at an underground facility outwest. I clearly saw the handler for this particular operation standing outsidethe entrance to an underground weapons facility. He was a middle-aged man with amoustache and graying hair— I know exactly how he looks; he was assigned to mycase.Inside this facility were some young men who were the grunts, the cannon fodder,operating this system to hit me. When I saw them, I turned to God and I said,\"Dear God, forgive them!\" and sent them a blessing. I saw them very clearly -and then I saw them seeing me. They had such a look of shame in their eyes. Theylooked away, and it all ended. After this, they stopped these nighttime attacks.I later learned that the poor people who run these devices often end up dyingfrom what they're doing -- that if they're projecting a disease onto someone,they get it. As usual, the operators and lower rung personnel are cannon fodder.They don't know it when they take the assignment. And that's why these handlerswere outside the building from which the system was being operated.I learned from this experience that, as these weapons were being directed at me,I could track back on the scalar electronic system, back to the source and seewhat they were doing. I would then put divine light around all of us and ask fortheir forgiveness—and also forgive them myself.Around the same time, I learned that Colin Andrews, the crop circle researcherfrom England, was experiencing some weird happenings, also in the early morning,preceded by this strange sub-audible click.I was tested severely during those years to see whether I would stay on thiscourse. I was extremely close, in the summer of 1994, to closing CSETI, endingthe Disclosure Project, and just walking away from all of it.I tell people: Visualize what happened on the last day, the last hour, the lastfive minutes of my last shift at the emergency department where I worked for 10years. A little boy was at a picnic, and he choked to death. He could not beresuscitated at the scene, and was brought into the ER. He was a beautifullittle boy with blond hair and about three or four years old.We worked on him for an hour, but he was already flat line when he arrived. Hedied in my arms. And in comes his big bear of a father, who collapses in myarms,128weeping and screaming, a bloodcurdling cry like you've never heard, when I tellhim his son is dead.Dealing with this subject every day is orders of magnitude more traumatic for methan that. And for the nurses and me, having a little child die on my last daywas as bad as it gets.Hearing about CSETI experiences is like listening to a version of the X Files,but this isn't Hollywood; it's the real thing. There are aspects of my work thatare wonderful and beautiful, and there are other aspects of this effort that areenormously painful and tragic. Perhaps this is a perfect metaphor of the timesin which we live; there's so much beauty and promise, and yet there's also somuch suffering.129"},{"pageContent":"19 WE ARE ALWAYS WITH YOUA few interesting anecdotes will give you an idea of the kinds of people I'veencountered doing this work.For example, while organizing the conference with Astronaut Brian O'Leary inColorado in 1992, we were approached by a woman who was insisting on coming tothe private retreat for researchers. This was Col. MK's companion, now wife, whowas claiming to be a journalist.She was actually part of Psy-Ops and Psy-warfare projects with the Colonel,whose specialty was psychotronic, radionic, mind-control weapons and what areincorrectly called non-lethal weapons systems. These EM weapon systems areactually used, at times, to kill people and use so-called scalar, longitudinalelectromagnetic waves.Somehow, she got my home number. I was away, so she called my wife—a wonderfulwoman who epitomizes noblesse oblige and kindness. So this woman said, \"Justexactly who do I have to fuck to get into this meeting?\" This, to my wife! Suchwas our introduction to the enlightened community of spooks and UFO sub-culturecrazies, and it's been downhill from there.That's all you need to know about the caliber of such folk. When I tell peoplethat the people you encounter in this field are some of the meanest, nastiest,most venal, corrupt people that you will ever meet anywhere on Earth in anysub-culture or setting, I mean it.But you also meet some wonderful people. One of the people who came to a lecturewas Dorothy Ives, the wife of Oscar-winning actor Burl Ives. Mr. Ives had beenfriends with the Nixons and the Reagans and with a number of other politicalfigures, and was a 32nd Degree Mason.Dorothy came up to me after the lecture, very excited, and asked if I'd returnto her home and meet with Burl. I suggested that she come with me up to theMacGuire Ranch where we were going to make contact with the ETs, and then wecould go see Burl.So after the conference in Denver, we drove up to the McGuire Ranch, in Wyoming,outside of Laramie.130We got there about sunset, and were doing our contact protocols. Right as thesun was going down, suddenly a brilliant, disc-shaped UFO appeared on top of acloud and hovered. It winked in and out of the cloud and was signaling to thewhole group.Dorothy had never seen such a thing. I explained, \"They're here, and they'revery much connected with us all the time. They know when we're going to go outand do this CE-5 Contact protocol.\" Often, when we would arrive onto a site todo this work, the ETs would already be there, because I would have told themwhere we were going and what time we'd be there. Dorothy was just amazed, andshe exclaimed, \"Burl has got to meet you.\" .We left from Denver and flew to Seattle and then drove up to their home inAnacortes, WA, right on the water.Burl and I became fast friends. The way you would see him on the stage isexactly the way he was in person. One of the greats of the 20th Century, by anyaccount.We met for a long time discussing a plethora of issues, the secrecy, thetechnologies, ET contact.. . “ You know, this is the most sane crazy personyou've ever introduced me to,\" he told Dorothy, who was always meetinginteresting and eccentric people. He understood that what we were dealing withwas something that had a lot of profound dimensions to it and that our approachwas very rational and very sane—given how \"far out\" all this is.Dorothy initially didn't quite know who I really was or the extent to which Ihad deep contacts within the intelligence and national security community.Eventually, this came up and I told her, \"There's a man whose family has deepties with the National Security Agency. They are senior NSA people, and arehanding off some documents to me.\"One of these documents was a big, oversized xerox copy of a 1962 document. Ithad code names like 'Project Moondust, Project 46', on it and it was classifiedtop secret- but had not been declassified! It was given to me so I could get itto the right people. This document was a wiretap transcript summary of what theylearned from listening in on Marilyn Monroe.This document has been authenticated by the top document authenticator in theworld. An FBI agent told me, \"You know, you can go to jail for X number of yearsand be fined thousands of dollars each time you show this to anyone.\" I said,\"Really? I've already shown it to a few thousand people. Come put the handcuffson! My first call will be to Ted Koppel or Larry King, and not to some lawyer.\"He looked at me like I was crazy, and I said, \"You think I'm kidding? Try me.\"Here's the headline: 'Emergency doctor goes to jail because he revealed adocument that confirms that spooks at the agency whacked Marilyn Monroe beforethey ended up whacking the President.'131Now,\" I said, \"you want that to hit the front page? Come get me.\" He just shookhis head with a look of shock - but they left me alone. We never heard from thatspook again.This document describes how Marilyn Monroe, who had been recently jilted by theKennedy brothers and was upset and hurt, called Robert Kennedy and a socialitein New York, an art dealer friend of hers. Marilyn Monroe stated that she wasgoing to set up a press conference and tell the public what Jack Kennedy hadtold her regarding objects from outer space that had crashed and been retrievedin New Mexico in the 1940's! President Kennedy had confided this information toher, because he had seen the ET craft and debris from the UFO crash there. Thisstill-top-secret document is dated the day before the night they found MarilynMonroe dead. I've also located someone who was with the Los Angeles PoliceDepartment intelligence unit that helped facilitate the wiretapping andmonitoring of her up to the time of her death and actually knew how they killedMarilyn Monroe. There is no doubt that she was murdered by cut-out agents of theUS intelligence community.Importantly, this document was signed by James Angleton— the legendary,fanatical mole hunter and leak stopper within the CIA. This document, in myopinion, was a death warrant for Marilyn Monroe, because it summarized what shewas intending to do rather imminently. I don't think she knew what she hadstumbled onto, in terms of the kind of buzz saw that was going to come at her.I'm now working with someone who has similar documentation on the murder of MaryMeyer. Mary Meyer was the long-term paramour of Jack Kennedy who was shot on theC&O Canal path in Georgetown, back in 1964, because she knew too much. Thiscontact has identified sources that knew why they murdered Meyer. And it's thesame reason they murdered Marilyn Monroe!When I mentioned all this to Burl he said, \"Marilyn Monroe and I knew each othervery well and I can tell you this: All of us who knew her knew that she had beenmurdered, but it wasn't until today that I knew why!\"Some of the people that Burl knew were good friends with Ronald Reagan. He wasable to confirm information that I had heard from other sources. For example, Ihave met two people who were with Ronald Reagan during the screening of \"CloseEncounters of the Third Kind\" by Steven Spielberg. This movie is actually adocumentary or docudrama, since most of what is depicted came from Air Forcefiles that Spielberg secretly had access to at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.Ronald Reagan turned to the people who were at the screening at the White Houseand said, \"There are only a couple people in this room who know how true whatthis movie is portraying is.\" This was repeated to me by two separate witnesses.132 [0002.png]Most people don't realize that one of the chief control points for the secrecyis the mobbed-up culture of money and corruption in Hollywood and the big media.It's very much infiltrated by interests of the \"national security\" shadow state.Of course, when you're someone like Burl Ives, you know everyone and everyoneknows you. So, one meeting led to another, and I ended up meeting a number ofcelebrities. What I found from some of these meetings was that the UFO matterwas an open secret - people knew it was real and that there had beenassassinations and murders to keep it secret. Hollywood and the entire film andmedia industry was mobbed- up, top down, with control points that had becomemore and more entrenched, as time went on.I learned from a number of people that you can't really do films on the subjectof ETs anymore unless there's a heavy militaristic, xenophobic overlay. We wentfrom \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"E.T.\" to movies like\"Independence Day\" and silly things like \"Men in Black\" or \"Mars Attack\". Thesemovies all have an invasion or military conflict theme. These covert interestswant the populace brain-washed via this type of propaganda to the falsehood of\"alien hostility.\"Hollywood, and the media in general, are key control points.After I taught Dorothy how to do the CSETI CE-5 protocols, she decided topractice them one afternoon while sitting on the edge of the ocean at Anacortes,Washington. She was with one of her grandchildren, and suddenly a UFO appeared!It was going in and out of the clouds and communicating and signaling with her.Her granddaughter said, \"Oh, God, look at that.\" And it was then that Dorothyknew she had this connection and could make contact.During the LA Northridge earthquake in the 1990s, Dorothy woke up around 4:30Pacific time and went downstairs. As she looked outside, she saw a golden lightcoming through the foyer windows. She looked outside at the source of the lightand saw a large extraterrestrial vehicle, just right above the tree line. Andshe was in the beam of light.She immediately began to receive a message mentally: \"Do not be afraid, you willbe safe, we are always with you, you will be protected...\" She instantly feltcompelled to call her best friend in LA, just as the North Ridge earthquake washappening. This woman said, \"Oh, we're having an earthquake, but you won'tbelieve what's here!\" And she told Dorothy, \"There's this dish-shaped craft withgolden light coming from it, and I'm in a beam, and I'm getting this messagethat says, 'Do not be afraid; you will be safe. We are with you, and you will beprotected.'\"It was exactly the same message, at the same instant, coming from identicalcraft that had placed them in this golden light. It was as if there was noseparation in space or that the ET craft had bi-located and was in two places atonce.134Dorothy called and told me what had happened. I told her that there might be alot of changes in the world, including the potential for major geophysical andother changes, and that these extraterrestrial people are connected to us andwill help stabilize the earth and protect humanity.An interesting encounter happened when I was invited to Cambridge University inthe 1990s to give a lecture to the international conference of MENSA, which is ahigh IQ group. I made a very serious, mainstream, data oriented, scientificallyoriented presentation.At the end of my talk, an elderly man stood up and said, \"I'll have you knowthat I'm Dr. So-and-So. And I've been on this committee and that committee inthe British government. And if there was any truth to this, I would know aboutit. Moreover, I find it utterly depressing that a man of your intelligence wouldbe wasting your life on such drivel!\" His neck veins were popping out and hisface was red with anger. This, in front of hundreds of people!I said, \"Well, with all due respect, if there's even a ten percent chance thatthis is true and there are technologies that enable inter-stellar travel andcould run this planet without pollution or poverty for thousands of years andcreate a sustainable world, it's worth my career and any sacrifice we make. Nextquestion?\"So, now, the post script to this: we had a banquet in one of the grand halls atCambridge that's still illumined with torches and candles. As I was leaving thebanquet, I heard feet running up behind me, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack.There were a couple of young scientists who had been with this senior scientistwho had been so agitated by my talk.They said, \"We wanted to apologize for Dr. So-and-So's behavior.\" And I said,\"Oh, that's okay, I’ve been called every name in the book, and I'm used tothat...\" Then they said, \"No, you don't understand. He was so upset not becausehe didn't think it was true, but because he's an eminent scientist and aphysicist, and deep inside, he thought maybe it really was true, and it meanteverything he knew and had been teaching for 60 years of his career wasrubbish!\"This man thought, \"My God, if this is true -- and I think it could be -- thenwhat I know about science and physics is a fairy tale and isn't evenkindergarten level science!\" And if this is true, being an eminent scientist atCambridge did not change that fact.This is a phenomenon that I have seen over and over again. I have been theunfortunate person who's had to walk into meetings with the likes of a Lord HillNorton, or the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency or someone who's a seniorscientist with the National Science Foundation and share this information withthem. These are important people, in important positions. And yet they realizethere is an entire universe of operations, technology, science and power beyondtheir control. It is very disturbing.135Many come to realize that they are a pawn or a cog in a machine not of theirmaking—or liking. It is traumatic to learn this when they're at what theyconsider the apex of their career and power.There are a number of predictable responses: anger, denial, acceptance, fear.In the mid-'90s, I was invited by the Board of Directors of Noetic Sciences todo a briefing for their board. The founder of Noetic Sciences was there alongwith a number of very prominent people. I presented what we were doing, what ourfindings were, what the evidence was. They also had a few disinformation peoplepresent who, at one time, had done good work in the field, but who had sincebeen bought off by intelligence interests.One such asset of the Shadow Government made a presentation saying, \"This is alla mythology, and there are these little balls of light occasionally seen.\" Hecompletely whitewashed all the hard evidence that he once wrote about. It was avery interesting thing to watch. I then stood up and politely said, \"Well, onthe contrary....\"Also, he was proposing, \"Of course, these things don't actually exist in thephysical world because they're inter-dimensional.\"I said, \"Well, inter-dimensional means nothing, insofar as a flower isinter-dimensional because it has folded within it everything from the physicalreality of the flower to the astral form and light that is within it, to theidea form, the causal idea of the flower. And the actual conscious intelligencethat created it and that sustains it is still present within the flower. Soeverything is inter-dimensional.\" There's nothing that isn't.\"I said, \"Look at your own selves. You have within yourself an opening to theInfinite Mind, and all the universe that's folded within it, as well as your ownso-called causal body, as the mystics would call the idea form of what you are.And within and supporting your physical body is your astral body—the body oflight that you can fly around with in lucid dreams or at other times.\"I said, \"The human being is completely inter-dimensional, or transdimensional,and encompasses every fine and infinite level of creation all the way to thegrossest manifestation, the physical. So, what are we talking about when we say'inter-dimensional'? It means nothing to say this. Everything isinter-dimensional. The question is: Are you in touch with enough dimensions toexpress them? Well, an adept, in India, may be able to de-materialize his bodyand become invisible. Or he might be able to manifest a ring or an object. Butan extraterrestrial civilization may be able to do the same things through bothmental capabilities and technological assistance. So, the fact that there areinter-dimensional expressions of ET technology does not mean they're notextraterrestrial or physical. It's not an either/136or question. Such an argument is like two people debating whether an orange isround or the color orange, when it's both orange, the color, and round.\"That night, we were hosted by Paul and Diane Temple for dinner. They are venturecapitalists and have a large estate next to George Lucas' ranch, near SanRaphael, CA.Senator Claiborne Pell was also there for the dinner. Senator Pell reallyepitomized the best of our leaders; he was a very enlightened man. Senator Pellknew what we were doing. I had worked with some of his staff and aides. So wemet in California in San Rafael at this hilltop home.Senator Pell, Emily and I stepped between huge Lalique doors that opened outonto the patio. We began to talk out under the stars. Senator Pell looked at methrough his black horn-rimmed glasses and said, \"You know, Dr. Greer, I've beeninterested in this for years, and I've been in the Congress since Jack Kennedywas a Congressman. I've been on every committee, and have made inquiries intothis, and I've never gotten a straight answer.\" He then asked, \"Would you bewilling to come and brief my staff on this and share with us what you know?\"\"Well, Senator, I'd be very happy to do that— any time we can set it up.\" Ianswered.He then said, \"But I don't know why they wouldn't tell me - why have I been keptin the dark?\"I made a few comments, as I have to others, about why. The \"why\" is always thehardest thing to answer, the most painful thing to answer, actually. \"You know,Senator Pell, it's a crying shame, because here you are, one of the trulyenlightened members of the Senate. You could do so much good as Chairman of theSenate Foreign Relations Committee. But you have been deprived of dealing withthe ultimate foreign relations issue!\" I said this, pointing to the stars aboveour head. He looked at me and blinked through his horn-rimmed glasses and said,\"Well, Dr. Greer, I'm afraid you may be right.\"I said, \"Yes! You, and people like you, should have been the vanguard of thehuman race making contact with these peoples and managing these technologies andmanaging our relations with them, instead of a rogue kleptocracy stealing itfrom us. The entire time you have been in the Congress and Senate, you have beenblocked from dealing with the most important issue of this century.\" It was avery poignant moment...I felt it very important for Senator Pell to understand what is at stake here:It isn't just about him knowing; it's about him and people like him who are inthe constitutional chain of command of our country, and who could manage thiswell but who are deprived of doing so. He and Senator Byrd and Senator Bryanhave been pushed out and the whole matter has been hijacked out of legaloversight and control into a rogue, illegal covert management.137Occasionally, when pressed, I have been asked, \"Don't some of the members of theCongress know what's going on and are part of this effort to keep the secret?\"Yes. And we know who they are. One of the people who is central to maintainingthe status quo and is a major control point in blocking information at the levelof the Congress is a senior Senator. Former Congressman George Brown ofCalifornia, who is since deceased, was involved with this group and wasresponsible, as a member of the Science and Technology Committee, for keepingthis quiet. There are other people who are cooperating with the secrecy, such asformer Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and current CIA Director,Porter Goss. I have provided information to him via a member of our team who isa very close family friend.The fact is that you only need a few points of control in these institutions tokeep it secret. These players then go to their colleagues in the Congress andsay, \"I've had top access, and none of this is true.\" Memo to their colleagues:People lie.Over the years, the covert government has always kept a few such operatives inkey points of control in various institutions, to maintain the secrecy and tomaintain the current order of covert management. This is true for every majorcountry in the world, every major Parliament in the world, and every majorreligion in the world. Academia and the scientific community are also similarlyinfiltrated.On the same trip I was invited to the home of Y.H., an incredibly spiritual,pure hearted woman who is the original publisher of a major new thought book andis a very big supporter of what we're doing. Her husband, who is a formermilitary man, knows about these things, and we've had long, interestingdiscussions about UFOs.One of the things that Y.H. shared with me is that she had become friends overthe years with a number of people who have been involved in these types ofprojects, covertly. She knew Andrija Puharich, Marcel Vogel at IBM and otherswho had an enormous amount of knowledge— but their knowledge was being used toempower technologies within this shadowy, covert corporate world. She knew otherpeople who played a dual role of acquiring information and passing it up thechain of command, only to then go out to the public and spread disinformation.One such figure is a physicist dealing with zero point energy. He told Y. thathe knew of actual operational free energy and zero point energy devices, butthat he is NSA and naval intelligence. After speaking with this physicist, hevirtually told me that he's an intelligence operative.Yet, something that he explained to Y. caused me to have an enormous amount ofcompassion for people in his position.138At the same time, there's a certain element of revulsion. He said that he verymuch wanted the truth to come out and for these Earth-saving new energytechnologies to be put into use, but that if he talked about what he knew, hewas convinced his family and children would be killed.It seems he had sold his soul to the devil, in the course of his career— and yethis whole being sincerely wants the world to have these wondrous new sources ofclean energy. So, he's deeply conflicted. His role has been to say, \"This ispossible, but we don't yet have it,\" when, in reality, he knows we have thesetechnologies but can't talk about them without risking his life and that of hisfamily. This is a common theme.The Disclosure Project's goal is to get people who have the courage of theirconvictions to come together as a team — and speak the truth! There is safety innumbers and credibility in numbers. But so many of these people we reached outto, in shadowy operations, would say to me, \"I want the truth out, but I'd liketo breathe the free air of Earth for another 30 days.\" Their fear was strongerthan their sense of duty, and they felt that if they spoke out, they were deadmen walking.I also met with Congressman Christopher Cox, currently head of the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, and who is on the short list of people who eventuallywill be running for President of the United States in the Republican Party.Harvard-educated, he's a very bright man representing Orange County CA, and wason a number of key committees. A friend and supporter of CSETI, who knowsCongressman Cox, and who is an executive with IBM in Orange County, asked me tobrief him.Shortly after the meeting began, Cox said, \"I have no doubt this is true, butI've never heard of it, and I've been on some pretty important committees.\" So Itold him about all the folks I've met with who are out of the loop who should bein the loop and that this is a common theme.Remember, The Disclosure Project is not just disclosing things to the millionsof people on the Internet and CNN, but also to people like Christopher Cox, whodo need to know.Sometimes these contacts and meetings happen rather mysteriously. At times Iwill go to a city, and lie down in my hotel room and ask, \"Who is here that Ineed to speak with?\" I will go into a meditative state and let my awarenesstravel to whomever it is I should see. I will then see a specific person, anddecide, \"I'm going to go to this particular place and ask this person to bethere.\"And when I go to that place, there they are! I see them exactly like I saw themin my meditation. They vaguely say, \"You look familiar\" I say, \"Oh, yeah?\" Andthen we talk, and they always ask, \"Well, what do you do?\" And I'll just flatout tell them.139Invariably, they will say something like,\" I work with SAIC -- ScienceApplications International Corporation -- and you don't know how right you are.Let me tell you about what I have seen...\" We have received information fromdozens of important intelligence sources this way.140"},{"pageContent":"20 A DIFFERENT DAYIn 1994, I was invited to be on a special with Larry King. The show wasbroadcast live from near Nellis Air Force Base, Area 51. Larry King's producer,at the time, a guy named Farmer, told me it was the most watched special they'dever had.There was a point in the interview when Larry turned to me and he asked, \"Well,what do you think the President knows about this?' As you now know, I had puttogether the briefing document for the President and Dr. Jack Gibbons, thescience advisor to the President, and had met with the CIA Director thepreceding December. So I said, \"Well, I think you should ask the President thatquestion.\" And I remember one of the other guests and Larry King said at thesame instant: 'What does that mean?'\" I said, \"Well, I think it would be betterif you asked the President that question.\" I was very cryptic.Afterwards, in Larry King's trailer we spent some private time together, becausehe knew that I wasn't saying everything. He asked me what I was really up to andI confided in him off the record about our contacts to the President and that Ihad already briefed the CIA Director. He said, \"My God, why didn't you say thaton the air? That would have been a scoop! —\" I said, \"Because I'm still workingwith these people.\"I was discreet about this meeting with the CIA Director until after he had leftoffice in '95 or '96.\"My God, this stuff is really real?\" Larry asked.\"Of course it is.\" I said. And then we had a very interesting conversation.Later I said, \"But Larry, why are CNN and the other news outlets covering the OJSimpson trial and tabloid trash like that 24/7? I don't know anyone who's evenremotely interested in that stuff. Everyone's so sick of hearing about it.\"\"Well, we have to.\" He said.'What do you mean, you have to? You're a journalist. Why don't you report thebig stories of the day? This is the biggest story of the century\" I exclaimed.\"Well, the corporate guys tell us that to keep our ratings up and compete with141the other networks, we have to cover this kind of lurid stuff, and they pay mybig pay check. It's all about ratings, and ratings get the advertising dollars,and advertising dollars pay me my big salary.\" And he was just that direct aboutit.I said, \"Yes, but what about journalistic integrity and editorial discretionabout what's important, what is really newsworthy?\"\"Oh, come on.\" He said, \"That's out the window and has been for years. It's allabout money and ratings.\"You don't think the big media can go any lower, until it hits another low point.It really is a race to the bottom - and they hit new lows every year!There are also covert national security filters in place to keep these big,sensitive stories out of the news. The corruption of the media is the centralreason for the secrecy.In 1995, we organized the first gathering of witnesses. There were about 18colonels and aerospace people and people from all over the United States andRussia. We gathered at Asilomar, which is a retreat in Pacific Grove,California, near Monterey. Laurance Rockefeller was very supportive of this andhis people were there, as well as some of the initial witnesses.It was all videotaped and audio taped, but the people, to whom I entrusted thistask, took all the tapes and made a back-door deal with the Rockefeller group.So we don't have any of the records of that testimony! And to this day, we havenot retrieved it.Sometimes people will see me being very fierce and careful about people andorganizations; there's a good reason for this. That kind of theft and betrayalhas happened over and over againIn late 1996/ early 1997 we decided that we needed to do a formal briefing inWashington, DC to which we would invite government whistleblower witnesses andmembers of Congress and other influential political people to whom we hadcontacts.Prior to that briefing Shari Adamiak, Neil Cunningham, a picture editor for theBBC in London, and I went to a lab in Phoenix run by covert operatives.One of the operatives said, \"You can use our digital labs to put together allthe videotape, for this meeting for Congress...\" We had collected videotape andphotographic images of UFOs from all over the world. Neil Cunningham of the BBCwas going to help us put together the best-ever images to show. Of course, weknew who this man was and we knowingly walked right into spook central.I began the CE-5 protocols. I went into an expanded state of consciousness andinto space and began vectoring extraterrestrial vehicles into the Phoenix area.I told the ETs, \"It'd be great if you can do something undeniable142while we're here that we can put into this footage to share with the Congresswhom we will be briefing in a couple weeks.\" This was on March 13, 1997, and thebriefing for Congress was in early April.The laboratory is in Tempe AZ, and while we were working there someone ran in,all excited. He said, \"There are enormous UFOs in the skies over Phoenix andthey're being filmed!\" It was the Phoenix Lights! And that event was a CE-5.We landed at around 5:30, and these events were occurring around 8:30. One ofthe longest sightings was virtually over the lab. That night on the local newswe saw footage that we could incorporate into the film summary we would thengive to Congress!One evening, while we were in the lab working very late on these digital images,a retired general walked in. He was a pilot for a private contracting airlinerunning covert ops and transporting drugs for these shadowy projects.We learned that there was a large cell of spooks conducting flight operationsout of Phoenix, importing and distributing contraband drugs. This general wasall coked up -- he was absolutely out of his mind on drugs.As he came over, he saw some footage of a UFO that I got from a military source.He looked at it and said, \"How the hell did you get this? This is top secret.\"I looked at him and I asked, \"You think I'm going to tell you?\" \"Who the hellare you?\" He asked.I said, \"I'm Dr. Greer.He replied, \"Oh, yeah, I know who you are.\"We were in this lab for days until the wee hours. The characters who wandered inand out were quite unbelievable; coked-up agents, former Air Force andintelligence people, black ops, druggies, high tech people, the whole nineyards—all operating out of this little obscure lab in Tempe.In the middle of this episode in Phoenix, I had to go to San Diego for one dayto do a lecture. Shari and Neil stayed in Phoenix working on the tapes at thelab. While I was away, these characters tried to seduce Shari into thinking thatI was the devil incarnate for trying to tell the world the truth about UFOs.She and Neil were bombarded by weird mind control and psychological warfareactivity that went on for hours. Finally, she said, \"I'm leaving here.\" And theybacked off.At one point, another member of my group was in contact with this same group.They took her out to the desert and began to try to convince her to turn againstwhat we were doing. They said, \"We know everything about Dr. Greer. We knowwhat's in his bedside table.... After she told me this, I said, \"You go back andtell these bastards I have no secrets from anyone I love. I have nothing that Icare to hide. Tell them to do whatever they want - it won't change a thing..\"143She flat out told them my every word. That was the end of that. They found wecould not be intimidated.I mentioned earlier a gentleman, who had approached me at a lecture in Tennesseewho said he didn't know why I wasn't dead yet, and that they'd been watchingwhat I was doing. He was a man who had personally been involved with and seenthe launching of a weapons system that had targeted and destroyed anextraterrestrial vehicle. He had individual, specific knowledge of thosesystems. During this period between the early '90s and the late '90s, I met notone but about a dozen people who had either been at facilities who weredeveloping these weapons systems or who were at actual events, where we hadtargeted and hit extraterrestrial vehicles using advanced electronics systems.Of course, the fantasy cover story for Star Wars or SDI is that there are\"brilliant pebbles\" - such as those used in the SDI program to interceptmissiles and things of this sort. In reality, the real action has always been inthe area of electromagnetic weapons systems and EMP weapons (electromagneticpulse weapons) and scalar systems. When an ET craft materializes in ourtime/space, it is vulnerable to these advanced EM weapon systems.We have top-secret witnesses who have been present for the aftermath of thoseevents, where they have retrieved or seen the crashed craft, such as JonathanWeygandt, who was on the Bolivian-Peruvian border when the cabal downed one ofthese ET craft in the early 1990s. We have people who have been in meetingswhere they were planning to do this. And we have people who have participated inthe development of these weapons.One such witness who came forward was at the 1997 meeting in Washington, D.C.,that we hosted for members of Congress, the White House and Pentagon officials.Congressman Dan Burton, who was Chairman of the House Government Reform andOversight Committee, was at this event, among other key people. Some of thewitnesses who were coming forward were going to say things beyond what even the'friendlies' within this control group felt was safe.This one witness, G.A., had specific, detailed information about these rogueStar Wars plans. He had sat in on joint meetings with the NSA, CIA, NRO and somecorporate programs, where he had seen these plans from the '70s on. He said theywere fully operational: there was a covert ability to not only target and attackactual extraterrestrial vehicles but also to stage a false attack on Earth,using alien reproduction vehicles that are man-made and other weapons systemsthat were highly classified. The intent was to use 'stagecraft' to fake an'alien attack' so that the people of the world would be united around BigBrother and a global corporate- military junta.144It would look like the \"War of the Worlds\". And it would surprise the nationalmilitary command center and most of the agencies, the CIA, the White House andthe Congress, never mind the masses and the media. Just as the gullible masseshave swallowed abduction stories and mutilations as proof of 'evil aliens', themasses would again take this Star Wars bait. I have interviewed numerous people,in classified projects, who have been on the abduction squads and have stagedabductions and mutilations.G.A. was really nervous about sharing what he had been part of. He confided inme that he had been approached by people he used to work with -- these werebuddies that had been in really special operations -- and some of them had savedeach other's lives in various situations. Such groups are like a truebrotherhood. They had been out of communication for a long time with each other,but knew what he was doing with The Disclosure Project. They certainly monitoredthat he was dealing with me.They begged G.A. to meet with them before he would say what he was going to infront of these Congressmen and White House people. One of Al Gore's and BillClinton's best friends was at this meeting, and they knew powerful Congressmenwould be there. So he agreed to meet with them.The morning of the event, in April of 1997, we gathered for a private meeting ofall of the assembled top-secret witnesses. Astronaut Ed Mitchell was also there.Just when we were about to get to G.A.'s testimony, we took a break. He came upto me and said he had to meet with members of this cell he had been part of—thatthey had surfaced and they were insisting they meet. He felt enough loyalty tothem that he agreed to meet. They took him out to an undisclosed place inVirginia and held him there until about midnight, after this closed briefing forCongress was over. They then returned him to the Westin in DC and he slipped anote under the door of Shari Adamiak's room, who was my main assistant. In thisnote he said, \"I really cannot talk about this now. They are begging me to saynothing about this until they can get things under control. They're going towork on it and they need some time.\" G.A. told me that, because of TheDisclosure Project, morale within this rogue group was very low.This rogue group in charge of faking an ET attack on earth had been exposed byus, and they were panicking. The only real power they have derives from secrecy,the element of surprise and the ignorance of others - and we were changing thatdynamic by revealing their plans.Numerous people on the inside of this operation, including an SAIC executive anda man who'd worked for years with all the major aerospace companies, have toldme that what we were doing had thrown this entire so-called MJ-12 control groupinto chaos. We were moving major information out to the big guns in DC and tothe public. There were defections occurring, and a lot of controversy, and thisgroup that was never very homogenized was becoming more fractured, due to ourwork.145But the insiders said to G.A., \"Give us some time to get this under control, andif we can't succeed, then you can talk about it.\" In a sense, I'm heartened thatthey haven't played that card yet, but I'm not convinced that it won't beplayed.The danger is that almost the entire world, including the majority of people whothink they know what's going on with UFOs and covert programs, would be fooled.This type of effort is called a deceptive indication and warning, or a false I &W, where you set up something that looks like an attack from an enemy, but itisn't. It is a staged event designed to achieve certain strategic objectives,like the Gulf of Tonkin incident. To expand the Viet Nam War and make a call formore funding and more troops, we essentially orchestrated what looked like anattack on our assets. So, I call this the Cosmic Gulf of Tonkin plan. It wouldtake everyone by surprise.Now, the only way it won't take people by surprise is if they know the truth.And that's why I felt it was so important for G.A. and people like him to comeforward, go on the record, name names, and talk about what the specific planwas.Carol Rosin was told by Werner von Braun, when he was virtually on his deathbed,that these covert programs would attempt to put weapons in space, and would hoaxextraterrestrial events and stage an attack. He warned this was a grave dangerto the world.But he said one thing that I asked Carol not to talk about during the DisclosureProject events: Von Braun said there were electronic warfare systems that affectconsciousness— that they were well developed and had the ability to affectbehavior and decisions. These so-called psychotronic weapons were the gravestthreat of all.Around this time, we had a retreat in Colorado. Present was a woman who hadworked in a corporation that was dealing with these technologies and hadpersonally been present when they were used. The operator could turn a dial andcause, say, a Board of Directors meeting to come to agreement on somethingwithin minutes, or they could turn the dial the other way and cause everyone tostart fighting and descend into utter chaos.I know others who have worked with E-systems, Raytheon, SAIC, and EG&G who dealtwith high-end electronics, and they also have seen versions of this havesameability.Sometimes I look at the world and at some of the people that we have to workwith and I'm convinced that they have been turned into zombies, because itdoesn't make sense that people are behaving in certain ways — it seems almostscripted.Some scientists that have free energy technologies have been targeted with146scripted belief systems and behavior patterns that have kept them from comingforward with these devices. They all seem to have the same personality quirksand behaviors, with unstable vacillations between hopefulness and paranoia. Sothe technologies always stay hidden - or never even get finished. We've seenthis over and over and over again. These weapons systems are being used tocreate this behavior. It's the only thing that really explains the degree towhich these technologies keep getting held up and diverted or taken off course.In the process of setting up these meetings in Washington we became more andmore aware that we were being targeted with electromagnetic weapons systems.After I was on Larry King, we went to New Mexico, near Roswell and did a CE-5project. One evening Shari Adamiak, one other researcher and I were out in thefield doing CE-5 protocols. We saw some people who were obviously doingreconnaissance on us. Then suddenly, while in one of our meditative states,Shari began shaking and almost convulsing. I knew it was a seizure brought on bya directional weapons system exactly like the one that tried to extract myastral body out of the St. Moritz Hotel earlier that year.I knew what to do: mentally I went to her and stabilized her back into her body,and neutralized the scalar system by using higher consciousness. The rogue groupwas attempting to do a forced astral extraction, using one of these electronicwarfare systems. Shari attempted to take a long, deep breath, but was visiblyshaken and frightened by the attack.Such attacks began to happen more and more, so we began our own counter-measureswith people who had versions of these technologies. I would notice that therewould be times when we would be gathering and there would be a pulsed wave thatwould come through. Literally, I would feel like I was being micro-waved fromthe inside out. As we put protective measures in place, these events subsided.We also created a very spiritual support team to do meditation and prayer forour protection.One of the worst experiences of this was the night of the congressionalbriefing, in April of '97. During our presentation to the congressmen, Isuddenly felt this energy wave hit me. It almost knocked me out. There was a manthere from the Pentagon who was aware of it, as well. It was so intense, again,I felt like I was being microwaved from the inside out.I could barely maintain consciousness and thought I was going to pass out on thestage. I have to tell you that, prior to this, Colonel MK had insisted on comingto this meeting. When we said, \"No, you can't come,\" he said point blank, in avery coarse way, \"I'm going to be there anyway.\" And he was -- if you get mydrift. He is, after all, Dr. Death, and a specialist in so-called non-lethalelectromagnetic warfare systems.147But each time these covert interests use these systems, they tip their hand andwe learn more about them....In the mid-'90s, I met a man who had developed some of these systems for theAgency prior to 1958. Many people think this sounds like something out of \"StarTrek\", but by 1958, this man and his team had perfected the electronics to beable to hook people up to a device that would electronically assist them toremote view any distant place or person. He was forced to sell this invention toa front company for the Agency. But at one point he asked, \"Would you like tohave one of these devices?\" I said, \"I'm not going to take that right now.\" Iviewed it as too high risk - and we already have the ability to do remoteviewing by developing our own higher awareness.Another scientist who was working in this area had developed electronics toenable people to levitate. One of our military witnesses is a colonel whoseparents in the '50s were friends with some people at the Rand Corporation. Theyhad seen people during their lunch breaks using these devices which enabled themto literally float above their desks.So, these capabilities have been around since the '50s. And look at where othertechnologies have gone from the '50s to now, in terms of electronics- andimagine how advanced these Shadow Government technologies are today! Of course,all these wondrous technologies could be used for enormously beneficial purposes-- everything from healing to transportation to energy generation.Unfortunately, they are held by people who are abusing power and are addicted tothe abuse of power.148"},{"pageContent":"21 ELECTROMAGNETIC TRANSFERAround this time, a former colonel surfaced via a CSETI board member who wasbest friends with former CIA Director, Bill Colby. Colby had been very involvedin these programs and actually had access to extraterrestrial devices, operativeenergy devices and other hardware, as well as around $50 million inunacknowledged funds. Colby wanted to transfer these assets to CSETI to get thisdisclosure done properly, with hard evidence and hard documents. This was whatwas offered to me.\"Finally\" I thought, \"CSETI will have sufficient funding to share the truth withthe world.\"Initially, the colonel wouldn't tell us it was Bill Colby whom we would bemeeting with. He would simply say that he's a very high official connected tothese super-secret projects.I said, \"That's fine, whoever it is. If they want to help us, we are grateful.\"And so I authorized this to go forward.The week our board member was going to meet with the former CIA Director, toformalize this transfer, Colby was found floating down the Potomac River! Thecolonel who set up the meeting personally told me that Colby was assassinated.His wife later said, \"I don't know why Bill would go out canoeing in therain-swollen, flooded Potomac River at night, leave the door to the house openand the computer on and the coffee maker on!\" She exclaimed, \"This is veryunlike Bill.\"Mrs. Colby was hinting that something wasn't right, but there was never aninvestigation. So they assassinated a former CIA Director who was friendly towhat we were doing, because he was going to make a definitive break with therogue group. He was getting old, and did not want to take this secret to hisgrave. Like many of our witnesses, Colby knew the entire covert world was out ofcontrol, and it had gone too far.I was shaken by this, but not out of fear. It's so disturbing knowing thatsomeone had lost his life trying to work with us.149From that day forward, I vowed never again to okay a transaction without knowingwho the players are. Because if I know who they are, I can protect them.By 1997, Shari and I knew that we were being targeted with increasingly powerfulEM weapons. And so it came to pass that, within a short time span, Shari, asupportive Congressman and I got metastatic cancer. I am convinced that thesewere electronically induced. At a subtle level of electromagnetism, you cantransmute elements, and also transfer something from one place to another— andinfect someone or harm someone electronically. This is a very lethal applicationof a science that could be used to heal people. Unfortunately, right now, theworst elements of humanity currently possess these technologies.When people worry about these technologies being disclosed, I say: \"Forget aboutit. The worst elements already have them!\"Thus began a very difficult and emotional time: Following the congressionalbriefings in 1997, within six months, Shari and I both had aggressive,metastatic cancer. I had malignant melanoma, which is highly fatal when it ismetastatic. So, to say that this was disturbing to me and my family is anunderstatement, of course. And Shari— who was the single greatest personassisting everything we were doing besides Emily, was suffering terribly frommetastatic breast cancer. Here we are, two totally normal people, with nohistory of these cancers in either of our families. And we get them the samemonth! It was just too much of a coincidence to believe...Now, I can't prove what happened, except I will tell you this: The world'sexpert in the pathology and diagnosis of malignant melanoma looked at the onethat they took off my left shoulder and said, \"It is metastatic.\" The first onewas metastatic. Now, metastatic means that it originated from a primary tumorsomewhere else. But I had no primary tumor anywhere else on my body or in mybody.I was checked out from the back of my eye where the retina is to anywhere wherethere is a melanocyte, the type of cell that makes a malignant melanoma. And noprimary was ever found! Ultimately I had to tell my dermatologist, \"Well, we canstop looking.\" He asked, \"What do you mean?\"I said, \"I know where it came from. It came from a laboratory in Utah, where itwas electromagnetically transferred onto me.\" And he looked at me and he asked,\"Do you think such a thing is possible?\" I said, \"Yes, I know it's possible.\"And I said, \"My right-hand assistant in the Disclosure Project has also justbeen diagnosed with breast cancer that is metastatic.\"\"Oh, my God,\" was his reply.At the time, we had a golden retriever, named Yami. He and I had always beenvery close.150At the same time I got cancer, he got cancer of his left triceps muscle -asarcoma. He had to have his entire left front leg taken off. When he came backfrom the vet, and I came back from the doctor, we had identical matching scars—to the angle of the scar and the type of staples used!To this day, I am convinced that Yami bonded to me and astrally took some of the'hit' from the EM weapon system targeting us. I believe he saved my life. Sospirit can work through nature, through a dog, whatever, to help!You can pray and meditate all you want, but if you're in downtown Hiroshima whenthe nuclear bomb goes off, more than likely you're going to get vaporized. Andthis is what happened. You can be Gandhi and you might bless the person as yougo down, but the bullet will go through you and kill you.Remember: the Orwellian \"mind fuck\" term is non-lethal weapons systems. But inreality, they're quite lethal. Language is often used to hide what they'reactually doing.Many insiders had told us that these covert projects were in a free fall andthere was a sense of panic— that we were really getting the information out to alot of powerful people and they were losing control.So, you can see the battle had been joined. And they lashed out. Around thattime, I acquired a secret document that had a list of the code names and projectnames dealing with the extraterrestrial connected projects. That document isactually in the Disclosure book.The day after the congressional briefings in 1997, I was asked to do a briefingfor the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Tom Wilson.In advance of this important meeting we sent a document to his people. Hisassistant told me that the Admiral had, in fact, found these code names and codeproject names and numbers useful; he inquired through channels and found some ofthese ops in a cell in the Pentagon.Once Admiral Wilson identified this group, he told the contact person in thissuper-secret cell: \"I want to know about this project.\" And he was told, \"Sir,you don't have a need to know. We can't tell you.\"Now, can you imagine being an admiral, J-2, the head of intelligence for theJoint Chiefs of Staff, at the Pentagon, and being told, \"We're not going to tellyou\"? Well, he was shocked and angry.I took one of our witnesses, Shari, our military advisor, and Apollo astronaut,Edgar Mitchell with me to this meeting with the Admiral. It was a stand-upbriefing. As the briefing progressed, he began canceling other appointments— hewas so interested in the information. The only reason the meeting ended when itdid was because Ed Mitchell had to get up to New York for a TV interview. Butthe Admiral,151I know, would have kept going for some time more.During this briefing, the Admiral and I discussed the risk this rogue group -that had shoved him aside - was to the United States, the rule of law and to thenational security. I pointed out that the first CIA director, Admiral RoscoeHillenkoeter, had written a letter in the early 1960s stating that the secrecyrelated to UFOs - and not the UFOs- were a threat to the national security. Itold the Admiral that this illegal, rogue group had ARV technology that can docircles around his B2 Stealth bombers. He thought a minute and said, \"Well, asfar as I am concerned, if you can get people who know about this matter to talkon the record, you have my permission to go to the media with this! This groupis illegal!\" So when people ask who supported disclosure, among others, I tellthem the head of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff!After this meeting, these rogue groups came at us with a vengeance. Obviously,they were very disturbed that we had gotten specific information to a man likeAdm. Wilson- and that they were shown to be the illegal operation that they are.So, Bill Colby was murdered; the Congressman died very quickly from the type ofcancer he had. Shari Adamiak and I got metastatic cancer at the same time. Andso now we're in the fight for our lives, literally.After the briefing for Congress in April 1997, Dan Burton came up to us andsaid, \"I want everything you have on this subject, because I'm going to lookinto it.\" It turns out, he tried to and then had someone visit him who said,\"Back off of this.\"Someone who knows him personally explained to me that the Congressman wasthreatened. If he's asked about it today, Congressman Burton will say, \"Oh, itwas just something I had a personal interest in.\" Not true: One of his bestfriends, who is his scheduler in his office, is a woman who saw a UFO hoveringoutside her bedroom window. She was close enough to Congressman Burton that heknew that she was telling him the absolute truth. As the chairman of theGovernment Oversight and Reform Committee, overseeing the government,Congressman Burton was a very appropriate key person— but within months, he wasshut down.So, here we are, getting this information to not only people like the CIAdirector, Sen. Pell, Senate Appropriations people and Senate IntelligenceCommittee members — but also to people who really have personal knowledge thatthis is real, like Dan Burton. And an increasingly powerful group of good men atthe Pentagon were interested and concerned - and discovering that, in fact, theShadow Government had taken over the subject. And on top of that, you've gotreally deep throats ready to pull the curtain back on the Wizard of Oz as hesits there pulling all the levers, scaring the hell out of people. We wereexposing what Werner Von Braun warned about:152Hoaxing an extraterrestrial attack so that there could be a global seizure ofpower around fear and war. I assure you, the people that were receiving thisinformation took it very seriously.So, in that setting comes this devastating personal turn of events. Shari, myclose friend and trusted advisor, who's situation rapidly worsened, passed awayin less than a year! It was a very emotional and difficult time for me.In July 1993, I was almost killed leaving the planning meeting for Disclosureheld near the Monroe Institute; in '94, there was the terrifying attack at theSt. Moritz hotel in NY City, followed by the strange 4 a.m. attacks later thatsummer at my home. And now this is '97. I was taken right to the limits of whatI could endure.And yet, some really wonderful things happened during this time....153"},{"pageContent":"22 A BILLION SCINTILLATING LIGHTSIn June of 1997, at a training group with about 20 people on Blanca Peak, inColorado, we had an extraordinary encounter with a dozen extraterrestrialelders. Shari Adamiak and I knew that there was an enormous amount of gratitudebeing expressed to us by the ETs. It was a beautiful, celestial meeting.As we were doing our protocols and inviting the ETs to come to Blanca Peak,there were a number of sightings of these objects zipping around the sky -- someliterally flying out of the mountain! I knew that there was a clearing up on themountain where we would make contact and had remote viewed it earlier. Suddenly,at the right instant, I got a message to go up to this site, in the pitch dark,and we left as a group for the contact site.The contact site was at around 9,000-10,000 feet up on the mountain. As wewalked silently to the site, with the 14,000 ft. peak looming above us, we beganto see a billion scintillations of light all around us. It was subtle, but itwas visible.The whole mountain was like that all night. The entire area was vibrating inthis celestial scintillating light. Even the ground and the rocks were glowingand sparkling with an amazing energy.When we entered the site - which was a circular clearing in the evergreen forestand scrub- we could see the shape of a craft. It was not fully materialized butwas circular, glowing and distinct half in this world and half beyond thecrossing point of light. It was trans-dimensional- - partially materialized,partially not, half astral and half material. Suddenly, as we entered thisobject, we saw that there was a semi-circle of lighted beings.I walked to a certain point and suddenly a brilliant, scintillating light wasright above me. That's where I went, and I stayed at that spot. It was notsubtle, but a clearly visible white scintillating light right above my head. Sothis is how I knew exactly where to be.The larger group stayed back as I approached each ET being and quietly connectedto him. It was clear that they were very senior, enlightened leaders.154Each one of them was from a different star system. There were no two alike. Ientered the state of God consciousness while at the same time connecting withthese beings.A beautiful communing began as we were each awake and aware of that time andplace and yet instantly awake in the infinite cosmic Being. It wastranscendental in many ways, although it was also very present, very real -super-real. As we were in this state together, I could see beyond that level ofenergy to another level where, suddenly, there were many angelic forms. And thenbeyond that, I saw the Avatar- a divine Being representing the Godhead. It was abeautiful cosmic gathering that no words can describe.I approached each elder ET independently, honored each person, and welcomed themto Earth, thanking them for their presence. At a certain point, others notedthat it looked like I had disappeared. Some people couldn't see me at all. Otherpeople could just see through me. I felt enlivened, lighter, enthralled. Myvibratory frequency was so high, I could feel myself becoming rarefied. At onepoint, I thought I was going to lift up or levitate or just disappear. But myexperience was that I stayed there, pretty much fully in the physical- and yetpeople were seeing through me. This went on for half an hour or more. It was acoming- together of people who were all part of the cosmic culture, if you will.We were there with them, for that purpose. That was the purpose of this meeting.The ET beings also expressed their gratitude for our work and effort - and askedthat we do all we could for universal peace. Specifically, we were asked tointervene to avert the Star Wars technologies from being used against ETpeoples. I assured them we would do all we can... The next day, Shari and I wentoff for a quiet time together in the San Juan Hills south of Blanca Peak. Weclimbed up on some rocks and I pulled out my compass. During the ET encounterthe night before, the compass had been in my left inner coat pocket, right overmy heart. Now, as I looked at this compass, I saw that magnetic north had beenshifted almost 180 degrees! The needle was altered so that it was pointingalmost 180 degrees off magnetic north. It was clear evidence of a very unusualmagnetic field flux anomaly that affected the compass from the encounter thenight before.The compass stayed like that for several days and then went back to normal. Wehave photographs of this, by the way. It is very reminiscent of this samecompass rotating counter- clockwise as the ET craft approached us in July 1992,nearly 5 years earlier!Then, in July of 1997, we took a research training group to England to that samearea, in Wiltshire, England, near Stonehenge.155That year, we were renting a huge old manor house that must have been built inthe 1600s or 1700s. We housed the entire team there for a week. Prior to leavingthe States for England, we learned that Shari's cancer had become metastatic andwas now in her lymph nodes. This was very serious.Also, I had just had another malignant melanoma taken off. So that first nightwe were in the manor house nursing our wounds and we were frankly veryemotionally upset. At times we were just laughing and telling stories, and attimes in tears. We just knew one or both of us were not going to make it...As we were sitting in the upstairs room of the manor house, Ron Russell and afew others, on the CSETI expedition, were outside on the grounds. Shari and Iwere just too tired and too upset to go out, but I had told the group theyshould go out by 10:30 pm. The room Shari and I were in had a bay window and alittle fireplace.Suddenly, we saw a brilliant light, like a ball or a cluster of light, fly rightthrough the closed window, turn and go over by the fireplace and then elongateinto an extraterrestrial person! Here is this extraterrestrial being,shimmering, again not quite fully materialized, standing about 3 feet tall.There was nothing subtle about this, because it was visible with the naked eyein the fully lit room. Shari didn't see it at first, so I said, \"Shari, look.\"As she turned, she saw the ET and exclaimed, \"Oh, my God \". We sat there inmeditation with this being, who was basically trying to console us. He was verysweet, and very grateful and very loving— just beautiful. We remained in thisstate of contact and meditation for probably half an hour. I knew then that oneof us wasn't going to make it, and this being was expressing great compassion,respect, and gratitude for our work.We had no intention of ever relating this account to anyone -it was so personal,beautiful and poignant. But the next day Ron Russell brought up the fact thatwhile they were out on the Manor grounds, a very unusual event was observed byeveryone. Out of the sky, at a little past 10:30 pm a light appeared, and thendescended, coming over the tree tops and directly into the bay window of myroom! It descended out of space in a clear sky, came down across the manor houselawn, and flew into the window.Ron exclaimed, \"That's Steve's room!\" And so they saw the arrival of this being,from space. The entire group outside saw how our encounter in the Manor housebegan: As a light from space that flew over the grounds and right into thewindow, whereupon I saw this light enter the room, then materialize as a beingon the hearth of the fireplace!You will find that the truth hides its own reality, because the truth is so muchmore bizarre- and beautiful- than a science fiction movie.156Our last expedition with Shari was in Joshua Tree Wilderness in 1997. April ofthat year we were at the Pentagon with the Admiral, disclosing all thisinformation in front of key people in Congress and the White House. But by thefall, Shari had metastatic lesions in her brain and was partially paralyzed.Shari had joined me in this effort in 1991. She was at the first lecture I'dever given. And she was with me until she passed away in January of 1998.I was going to cancel the Joshua Tree expedition, but Shari said, \"If it's thelast thing I do, I'm going to be there with you and the ETs.\" And so she was...We were all amazed by the indomitable will of Shari. She was a lioness,completely fierce, very devoted and extremely competent. Shari was the firstperson that I could take as far as anyone could possibly go, into contact. Shecould go the furthest, without exception. There's nobody else, to date, thatcould go that far. She had no fear and knew her destiny.It was she and I who privately went out to the Baca, this remote area of theColorado Rockies where we have our trainings, near Crestone, in 1996. It was avision quest. I told her that I wanted to show her some things and tell her somethings that I had always known -- since I was very young, since my contact as ayoung boy. I had never told anyone, but I knew that she was very perceptive andspiritually awake; I knew she was ready.So, we went to the Baca on a cold evening in the spring of '96. I said, \"Let'swalk out and invite the ET beings in.\" As we did, we saw a craft in the sky,moving very strangely. Suddenly, I said, \"Now, look out here in the field.\"There, an enormous discoid-shaped area was scintillating with light. It was likea hologram, but more real and more alive. After a few moments, distinct humanoidshaped forms began to emerge from this craft, and approached us. I said toShari, \"Now, let me show you how these extraterrestrial beings prefer to stay inthis form when they're on Earth, because it's safe.\"As this event was unfolding, I said to Shari, \"Now, I want to tell you what thestructure of the cosmos is and how it's put together and how it is that they arehere.\" We had a tape recorder, so I began speaking and recorded what you now canread in the chapters in \"Extraterrestrial Contact: The Evidence andImplications\": \"The Crossing Point\", and \"Extraterrestrials and the NewCosmology\". That information was recorded in real-time during this contact inthe desert of Colorado.Later that evening, we went back to the Baca Townhouses. As we drove to thetownhouse, I said, \"Now, they're going to follow us home.\" We saw these brightstrobe-like lights along the road, escorting us as we drove back to the condo inCrestone.After we got back to the condo, we went out on the patio to see the Sangre de157Cristo Mountains that rise up 14,000 feet, covered with snow. They were shiningin the moonlight in the crystal clear air of the Rockies. I said, \"We should behere, because they're going to show us one of their points of entry and wherethey like to be. Now, look around. Can you see the fine structure of the fabricof the astral component of the cosmos that supports the material creation?\"I explained, \"Thought and consciousness and the astral forms of light, supportthe material cosmos. A 'gap' exists, where the realm of pure consciousness,thought and astral light phases into a semi-materialized energy field. This isthe realm where the astral crystallizes to the material, like an architecturalblueprint. The astral becomes crystallized, as a matrix, that then supports thematerial objects and even the atmosphere.\" And as I said that, it was like aveil fell away, and she saw it- the structure of this celestial, etheric andastral realm as it crystallizes into what we call the material cosmos.\"Now, look up here on the mountain.\" And there was an enormous sombrero-shapedcraft that was translucent. It was not fully materialized, but was like a reallydense, perfectly shaped cloud, being lit from within — a golden-white light,sitting on the very top of one of the highest peaks above Crestone. It was therefor about 45 minutes.Because Shari could see and experience those things, I had someone to articulatethem to. And because I could articulate them to her, I could share them withothers. We cannot teach anything unless there is someone ready to see it. Thereis a saying: \"The wise are they who speak not unless they have a hearer.\"The first year we went to Joshua Tree was 1996. Early on, a very fast, spiralingcraft came right overhead. We could actually hear it whistle, it was so low inthe atmosphere. It came right overhead and over the Palm Springs Valley.Everyone in the group saw this and was astonished!One night, we were leaving one site in Joshua Tree wilderness because I had aremote view that we should move. As we drove along this dirt road, very late atnight, suddenly the dashboard lights dimmed. I turn to Shari, \"Oh, they'rehere.\"Seconds later, coming straight down from the zenith, a huge craft shaped like aHershey's kiss appeared! It was flat on the bottom and tapered up to a point,and had a scintillating, sparkling tail on top, as it came down at enormousspeed towards the desert floor. It was 200-300 feet in diameter.It was a teal color, and brilliant - so bright that it illuminated the desertfloor like daytime and then, whoosh, went straight into the Earth and it wasgone. \"Ah. This is where they're telling us they're going to be located underthe Earth.\" I said.If you have the ability to materialize and de-materialize objects, you can stayin a quasi-materialized form so that one object can go straight through anotherobject,158like a ghost going through a wall. There's no reason why not. Most matter is,after all, \"empty space\".As I drove, I mapped, mentally, precisely where this huge ET craft went into theEarth. Driving very rapidly, I raced to that site. But there was a vehicle infront of me, going too slowly. I floored our car and flew by them so that Icould track exactly where the ET craft went into the Earth...We have a special site where we do our field-work in Joshua Tree now, where wesaw this huge craft go into the Earth.Shari was determined to come, but the cancer was all through her body and was inher brain—she could barely walk. The first night, she lost her balance and fell,skinning her knees. But she said, \"Oh, it's okay. It's okay.\" Here she is, onher deathbed, and is still determined to join us in the name of Universal Peace,to be out under the stars, together with these cosmic beings. It was all sobeautiful - and yet, at the same time, so painful for me.159"},{"pageContent":"23 INFINITYThe first night in November of 1997, we set up in an area called Hidden Valleyin Joshua Tree. There was a tree next to us that - even though there was no windbegan to shake violently, inexplicably. People in our group started shouting,'What is going on?’ And I explained, \"They're letting us know they're here.\"The ETs actually went from person to person, touching us on the shoulder or onthe head. We also had an anomalous high-pitched electronic tone move through thegroup that most everyone heard. So I knew that they had locked onto where wewere, and we were connecting.The moon was maybe three-quarters full. It was a magnificent, crystal clearnight. All of a sudden, what looked like a bright light bulb turned on in thesky. It simply appeared fairly close and big about a third the size of the moon.This enormous craft lit up, floated along underneath the moon, and thendisappeared. This was an absolutely unambiguous sighting of an ET craft. It wasin the direction of where the ET craft had come straight down and gone into theEarth one year earlier.The final night of Shari's last expedition, while driving west to the PalmSprings area, from Joshua Tree, an amazing send-off happened for her. It waslate, and of course she was exhausted from battling cancer.Suddenly, a huge craft came flying over the valley, very reminiscent of thefirst night she and I were ever in that area. This enormous craft was right atthe point of the speed of light. To our delight, the lead part of this seamlessship got ahead of the back part, like an accordion that's elongating, thencontracting. The ET beings were saying goodbye to Shari...By December, Shari was in a coma and unconscious. In January, 1998, she passedaway.I've been with a lot of people when they've died, working as an EmergencyDoctor. And I've always known from my own near-death experience that it'simportant, if possible, to have someone there to assist them in connecting tothe160Godhead —to help build a bridge to the worlds of light. Our culture has all butforgotten the sacred moment of the passing. Today, everyone is hooked up totubes, and it's all very technical— but there's a lack of appreciation of whatelse should be going on at that moment, as we transform from the physical planeto the celestial and astral world. I want to share this story because itillustrates what is possible in that regard.In January, people who were taking care of Shari wanted me to fly out to Denver.I had visited several times and was very involved in those final months. But Isaid, \"I will come out when the time is right.\" Timing is everything — and eachof us has our moment of a sacred passing to the other side.Early one morning, while I was meditating, I suddenly went into a state ofcosmic consciousness and then into God consciousness. What I saw was theentirety of creation in the shape of what some call the cosmic egg. If you canimagine: it was infinite, and yet it was discrete. Around it was the infinity ofGod. I was in a state of being perfectly one with that and aware of it. Then Isaw that Shari was there. She was ahead of me, and I knew that what I was doingwas showing her the highest celestial level of creation. I knew that she wouldgo into the infinite, celestial home ahead of me - because she was literallycloser to that infinite cosmic conscious place...I knew that she was going to go into it and become one with it. It was, in asense, the raiment of God— the body of God. It was the total expression ofCreator, Creation and unbounded Mind together. I could see the totality of thecreation as this gorgeous peach-pink-magenta, sombrero-shaped or galaxy-shapedentity -similar to an egg. It was infinite, even though it was discrete - filledwith joy — indescribably magnificent. It was not only physically stunning andcelestial, but filled with love and everything beautiful.As we approached it, we heard a trillion— an infinite number of — beautifulangelic voices, like the Vienna Boys Choir, singing, \"We are all one in spirit\"over and over and over. As I gazed into infinity, I could see that every createdbeing in the cosmos was represented in it, and yet were still one in this stateof infinite awareness. From the morn of eternity, the sound of these voicesrepeated, \"We are all one in spirit\" in a specific melody so exquisite - if onlyI could describe it. It was beautiful beyond words. And just as that happened, Idissolved into that state of infinite love and perfect unity in consciousness.After coming back to the awareness of my bedroom, I looked over at the clock andmarked the time. I knew in my soul that seven 24-hour periods— seven rotationsof the Earth— from that exact moment would be the moment of Shari's passing. Ijust knew it.Well, she was getting closer and closer to death, and everyone was saying, \"Oh,161you have to be here.\" And I said, \"I will be there.\"So, on the sixth day, I flew to Denver. Her family and Ron Russell and all herclose friends were there—and then I just sort of enigmatically appeared. I said,\"I'm here because it is time.\"That night I waited till everyone left Shari's hospice room, and then sat withher in prayer and meditation. She had been in a coma for weeks. As I read abeautiful prayer to her, I looked over - and her eyes opened for the first timein weeks. And one enormous tear glided down her cheek. She knew I was there.So I told her, \"It's okay -- you can go now.\"I was certain that Shari needed to hear that from me, because she had told methat she felt she was abandoning me with the burden of this work. I said, \"Youcan do enormous work on the other side. You can do many things beyond what youcan do here.\" What most people don't know is that those enlightened people whogo to the other side are the leaven that mysteriously raises this world.They're the inspiration and the unseen hand that protects and guides and helpsthe progress of this world. It's happening all the time, whether we see it ornot.I connected with her very deeply, reassured her, and said, \"You can go now. It'stime. You can go.\"Seeing her in her coma state, and realizing that she'd complete her passage tothe other side by the next morning - I felt a deep sorrow.I was staying in Shari's home, which was now empty, except for a woman who hadbeen caring for her. But, that night I couldn't go back right away, so I went toa night place in downtown Denver. I simply wanted to sit and have a drinksomeplace.A gay couple began chatting with me. I ended up telling them all my feelings. Iexplained to them about the astral and spiritual realm and what was going tohappen. These new found friends were extraordinarily pure hearted and spiritual.Just what I needed on this night - in a most unlikely setting!I've found that I can go to places like that and meet such spirituallyincredible people. On the other hand, I can go into a church and meet misguided,cruel people. So, it's not the place, it's the intent.Late that night, I returned and slept in Shari's old room. That morning I awokevery early, sat up in bed and meditated. I quietly marked the time, because Iknew the exact hour and moment, adjusting for time zones, of her passing.The woman who had taken care of Shari suddenly knocked at my door, \"It's time -she is close to passing...\" she said. \"You're all dressed and ready to go!\" shesaid, with a surprised look.I arrived before the others and spent time alone with Shari, taking her into thestate of infinite peace and love and into that unbounded state of pure cosmicmind that awaits us.162As others gathered, we said prayers together, standing around her bed in asemi-circle.At a certain moment, after we prepared her spiritually and connected her to God,I turned to her and said, \"Now, let go of all things, Shari, and go into theeternal Light.\"And with that, she took her last breath, and ascended to Providence. Her passingwas beautifully peaceful; even so, I was devastated. Suddenly, there was anextraordinary power that entered the room. It felt like the darshan or spiritualfield of a highly enlightened Avatar— like a breeze of powerful divine energythat swept through the room and completely through me. It was physicallypalpable! I then knew she went to the highest level. And then I completely fellapart!All of us need to care for one another in this way at the time of our passing;we all need the help, prayers and spiritual power of each other, so that we riseto the highest and best spiritual state possible at the moment of our transitionto the next plane. The night of her passing I wrote the following tribute:\"Shari Adamiak passed on to the world of Light today, January 20, 1998 at 9:50A.M. MST. Shari made her transition in the presence of friends and loved ones,peacefully and without pain. I ask that everyone pause to say a prayer for Shariand the progress of her soul in the presence of God. What words can contain oursense of loss and the love we all shared with Shari.Since 1991, when we first met at a lecture in Los Angeles, Shari has been apillar of strength and support, an indefatigable colleague, a true friend, anintrepid fellow explorer, an irreplaceable confidant and a fearless lionesswithout whose dedication CSETI could not have realized its many historicachievements.She has been my right hand and trusted assistant for over six years. Whetherbraving the dangers of the remote parts of Latin America or assisting withmeetings at the offices of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon, Shari wasthere with me - and for all of us. She never faltered and she never gave up.Unfazed by the barbs of critics or the machinations of relentless covertoperations, she resolutely worked for a time of peace - a peace universal, forthe Earth and for countless worlds beyond.How many wonders did we witness together? From walking in the shadow of some ofthe world's largest volcanoes with ET spacecraft floating silently above us, towatching a dozen top-secret military witnesses tell an assemblage of Congressmenthe truth about UFOs, Shari and I saw events unfold of such great significance.And through it all, Shari was filled with a joy, an excitement and energy, analmost childlike curiosity and wonder at the mysteries of creation and the163astonishing potential of these times.Even as her body began to fail her, she evinced a spirit of such grace, courageand love that all those who knew her were amazed and blessed by her example.Just two months ago, in November of 1997, she journeyed to Joshua Treewilderness in California with me. There she experienced what she loved most: theoneness with the stars, the universe and the communication with those peoplesfrom other planets visiting our turbulent world. Fighting weakness, pain andincreasing paralysis of her right arm and leg, Shari went into the desert eachnight, undeterred by the growing obstacles posed by her physical condition. Andthere, through the crossing point of light, we saw the depths of space and thepeople and spacecraft from other worlds, who await our own coming of age as apeople. Nothing would keep her from this purpose.Now, a great light has gone from this world, but it shines forever brightly inthe realms of eternity. I know Shari was ready for this great journey: Preciselyseven mornings before the morning of her passing, we crossed over together tothe other side, if only for a while. Awestruck, we witnessed a Light - aPresence- so beautiful, emanating from the center of creation. No words candepict it; it was beyond anything the intellect can grasp. An infinitebrilliance, golden while in the center and becoming more peach, pink and magentaas it expanded infinitely before us, suffused us in a sea of love, joy andbeauty unlike any experience of my life. It was the experience of theconsciousness of God - pure light, unspeakable love and peace. And permeatingthat Spot were millions of voices joining as one, singing a melody too sweet torecall. And the refrain was: We are all One in Spirit\".Knowing her time was near, I came to Denver yesterday to see her to the otherside. Last night while saying prayers, she emerged from the coma, and with alook of great joy on her face, opened her eyes. I told her all was ready. Icould hear her acknowledge these words, and a large tear welled up in her eyesas she knew that our time together in this world was nearly over.This morning, we were called to her bedside. As we gathered, we said prayers andprepared her spiritually for the transition. As lights and a great spirit filledthe room, we said it was time, and I said: \"Shari, go into the eternal Light.\"With that, she took her final breath and ascended to Providence.Even while knowing the joy and love of her present state, the loss isnonetheless severe, but let us remember her thus: She lived in the world ofLight, joyous, and she would want us to continue the work to which she dedicatedher life - the establishment of Universal Peace, and the creation of a cosmiccivilization.And we find hope in the knowledge that those who have passed on to the nextworld become the leaven which raises this world of existence. Shari and Idiscussed her future work, from beyond the veil of light, which would advancethe164cause of peace and enlightenment in all the realms of God. I have no doubt thatshe will serve well from her new home in the eternal and become one with theangels of peace.Without peace, there can be no progress on the Earth. So let us work for peacewith hearts filled with love. For when we pass from this world, all we reallytake with us is love - endless, infinite love.\"The night of her passing after writing her tribute I went into a very deep sleepand had an extraordinary experience with an ET. I awakened into a lucid dreamwith an extraterrestrial who we now call Kindness who was being introduced to meby Shari. She was an ET that was so evolved that she could communicate with bothShari in her astral light body and me simultaneously.This being, a female extraterrestrial, had a perfectly round head, no hair, andreally exotic, beautiful eyes and a very beautiful face. She was very slenderand fine-featured. As we connected with each other, she exuded the mostextraordinary kindness. She was the embodiment of perfect kindness—very kind,very loving.As I was talking to her, at some point I asked, \"Do we have your permission nowto do this Disclosure of the truth ourselves? The President has failed to act,the international community has failed to act, and the Congress has beenintimidated or is frightened or corrupt.\"Kindness said, \"Yes, if you can, do it.\"If you can, do it. And so, it was green lighted by this very senior ETambassador.So from '98 on, we put together the plans for the 2001Disclosure, knowing that it was approved by this extraterrestrial the nightafter Shari passed away. And this after the head of intelligence for the JointChiefs of Staff had said something very similar.Interestingly, in this same lucid dream, I was with Bill Clinton and we werehaving a discussion about this. And with a very sardonic smile, he said, \"Well,I can't do this, but you can.\" And, of course, what he was saying is that \"Iwon't do it because it's too dangerous, but why don't you?\" John McCain is rightwhen he says that courage is the indispensable quality for real leadership...We always felt that this work was being assisted by Shari. And it turns out thatat nearly every contact expedition since 1998, the extraterrestrial who I callKindness, has appeared in a beautiful blue-white ship. Often it will zip intothe sky, make an arc and flash the group, shining a blue-white light on all ofus! I know it is this senior spiritual and political ambassador of theextraterrestrial coalition that has been connected to us since 1998.Before that, my main ET contact was a male ET that had jet black hair with veryCaucasian features, intense blue eyes, and the whitest skin I've ever seen.165He is the ET that contacted me in 1990, when I started CSETI and all theseprojects.Kindness' spacecraft has been seen more than once right over our house inVirginia. Our neighbors have seen an intense blue ship, that is not quite fullymaterialized, actually enveloping and hovering over the house at 4:30 in themorning. One neighbor had no idea I was involved in these projects at the time.But when she looked at this cobalt blue disc right on our house, what she feltwas incredible peace and protection.After Shari passed, I was emotionally spent for a while. I felt responsible, andhad survivor's guilt. The children knew I was sad, so they gave me a video tapeof \"The Bird Cage\" that Christmas. I watched it and watched it and watched it —I needed laughter therapy -- because not only did I have cancer, but then I wasalso now very sad because my closest friend had died. Frankly, she had beenmurdered.I have met all kinds of celebrities and rock stars and CIA directors andsenators. But the only person in the whole world I care to meet is NathanLane—Ms. Albert in \"The Bird Cage\"! I would love to spend some time with him andtell him, \"You saved my life with this movie, because I laughed my way back tohealth!\"After Shari passed on to the other side, we went to Hawaii in February of 1998,and were with Joan Ocean on the big island. We did the extraterrestrial contacttraining program there and had a very positive experience. For me, it was reallyneeded, because I was devastated by Shari's passing and by a lot of the otherthings that were happening.One night we saw in the field a scintillating, electric blue craft. It was notquite fully materialized, but it was clearly visible and a beautiful disc ofcobalt blue light. It was Kindness- the ET I met the night Shari passed over.At the end of the training, we went out to swim with the spinner dolphins, underthe guidance of Joan Ocean, who is an expert in dolphin contact. The spinnerdolphins jump out of the water and corkscrew spin and then go back in; they'reso very playful.After much searching, we arrived at an area where there were spinner dolphinsnearby. I got in the water with Linda Willitts, my partner who was swimming withme. I went into a state of expanded, relaxed awareness and a group of fourdolphins came over.I stayed in a very innocent, child-like state where one is just awake, butwithout expectation or force— just being. It is a very Zen-like state ofconsciousness and deeply peaceful.Then suddenly these four dolphins approached and adopted me into their littlepod.The four dolphins and I made a star formation: there was one ahead of me,166one on my right flank, one on my left flank, and one beneath me -- just exactlyas though we were planes flying together in formation. I was close enough that Icould see their eyes and touch them, if I had wanted to. We looked into eachothers eyes with a very deep knowing and playfulness.I swam away with them, but when I could not keep up, they would slow down forme. They would take me down and dive, but I couldn't stay down as long as theycould, so I'd come up. And as I would come up, they'd come up in unison with me.We were heading right out into the open ocean. The boat was getting smaller andsmaller in the distance, and Linda could not keep up. So for safety reasons, Ihad to turn around, but they were taking me out to their special area out in theocean.It was a beautiful experience and a very peaceful communing with theseintelligent beings in their element. This is a good way to train for being withthe ETs. We enter the same non-forceful, innocent and playful state of cosmicmind. It's like the elusive butterfly: You have to be in a certain state ofmind, and when they are comfortable with you, they will come. You must becompletely one with their consciousness.I find that this is a wonderful practice to do with dogs and other animals. Wecan have a very special, mystical connection to animals.At the end of this trip to Hawaii, on a moonlit night, we went hiking where thelava from the big erupting volcano plunges into the ocean. Near a welcomestation a brilliant strobe light, blue-white in color, simply appeared within afew feet of us.When we got back to the vehicle, the lights were on and the doors were unlockedand all the electronics were changed within the car. We eventually were flashedtwice by a distant object. This has happened thousands of times over the last 15years.In Joshua Tree, on a subsequent event, we were at that site where the craft hadentered the earth. Suddenly, we began to see these unusual lights flashing onand off in space. They didn't move and it wasn't a satellite; it was just alight that went on and off.Well, at one point, the whole group was suffused in this unusual light— asubtle, silvery light. Everyone noticed it! It was like we were in a cone oflight, and it was very silent and peaceful. This continued for around a halfhour. And then as quickly as you would snap your finger, it vanished andeverything became pitch black again!On one of the expeditions to Crestone, Colorado we were doing a protocol tocreate a protective dome around the group.167Suddenly we had a really wonderful sighting of Kindness' bluish-white ship. Itcame in and made an arc and then went back out into space.As we were doing this, we sensed that there was a huge craft that had settledaround us. It was completely silent and only partly materialized. But the airaround us suddenly got warmer and you could see a distinct glowing form allaround us. Many people saw ET beings moving around us, again almost ghost-like,not quite fully in this material dimension.We saw a golden craft with a red light going around the outside of it. In thedistance, a spectacular electrical storm was occurring. Well it turns out thatthere was a cook and other staff who worked at a little motel called \"The WhiteEagle,\" near Crestone. They had gone out for a break, and were looking overtowards the Baca where we were located. They didn't even know what CSETI was orwhat we were doing. But as they looked over towards where we were located, theysaw a glowing dome, like a ship, with red lights going around the base of it,counter- clockwise. They were absolutely shocked. And they said they could evensee through other objects to see it: The farmhouse that was directly in the waywas not visible to them.Of course, the next day, they reported this to us. They were absolutely stunnedwhen they heard that we were exactly at that location of the craft and what wewere experiencing. I understand they ended up leaving the valley because theywere utterly unnerved by this experience!After this craft moved away, the temperature, within moments, dropped 10 to 15degrees. It was like we were in a building and then the building was gone!168"},{"pageContent":"24 STAGECRAFTThere is no doubt that the ET civilizations are very advanced, and not justtechnologically. To go faster than the speed of light through the cosmos, anycivilization has to evolve socially and spiritually, or they will destroythemselves before they could ever reach Earth. Now, many people are addicted tothe good ET/bad ET fantasy because we anthropocentrically project onto them whathumanity has done to itself. But the truth is that we have only ourselves tofear.The path of wisdom, regardless of how you view ET motives, is for us to beambassadors to them, to engage them in dialogue and to create peace together. Weare not going to solve any perceived conflict or differences through weaponsystems, no matter how sophisticated they are. Advanced EM weapon systems havethe potential to be many times more devastating than nuclear weapons. So thereis no possibility of any civilization human or ET surviving armed conflict atthat level of technology Those addicted to the paradigm of war- and space wars-are misguided conflict addicts, and need to be reined in. As mentioned earlier,a plan exists to deceive the public so they can keep the whole war machine goingon and on and on-expanding more grandiosely into space.One of the things that Werner von Braun shared with Carol Rosin was that firstthere would be the Cold War, and then there would be states of concern and roguestates. And then he said, specifically— this was 1974 there would be globalterrorism and the threat of asteroids from space. And following that, thecontrollers would roll out the hoaxed extraterrestrial threat. And all of thisis designed to achieve maximum control of the world's population through fear.When Carol Rosin told me this, I told her, \"I've met with a half a dozen otherpeople who have been in planning groups where exactly that scenario has beengamed.\"Our experience with these extraterrestrials is that they are clearly saying,\"Try to get this corrected. Do what you can.\" And so we are doing what we can.Carol Rosin had an experience with advanced mind-accessing technologies that sheshared with me.169When she first met Werner von Braun, he was very sick and she was asked by himto give a talk on his behalf at a big gathering of aerospace people in Chicago.She felt very unprepared for this, but he said, \"You'll be fine; don't worry.Just go.\" So, she went and had no idea what she was going to say to all thesethousands of people.As she began her talk, suddenly she heard Werner von Braun's voice speaking toher, in her ear. She did not have any kind of implant or any kind of electronicdevice in her. She gave the talk from listening to Werner von Braun speaking toher in her ear and gave the entire talk that way! That's when she realized justhow advanced these systems are.You do not have to have a specific device in anyone when using the reallyadvanced non-local electromagnetic systems developed by this rogue group. Ofcourse, one of the things that has been done in terms of controlling behaviorand inducing memory are the so-called implants that people have taken out ofalleged abduction victims. These are manufactured by covert high-end electronicsfirms and are then implanted into people through hoaxed abductions. Theseabductees are then directed to specific unwitting (or compromised) abductionresearchers, who then claim ETs did it! What a travesty!Since they have no idea what the covert human capabilities are, such researchersclaim only ETs could have done it. Nothing could be further from the truth. Ifyou don't know what the human covert capabilities are, there is no way you canjudge what it is that you're observing— whether or not it is of human orextraterrestrial origin. After 50 or 60 years and trillions of dollars in covertexpenditures, working with some of the most brilliant minds in the world, somereally amazing advances have occurred in the covert world. I'm certain that thestate-of-the-art is extremely advanced and is, in some respects, approachingparity with some of the extraterrestrial capabilities.Also, we have noted that many abductions are clustered near military facilitiesor within military families. I learned from some of the people who were lookinginto this back in the '70s and '80s that they had found a very strongcorrelation with military families and personnel and military areas. This wasreported to some of the civilian UFO groups, but the people trying to get thatinformation out were blacklisted from every meeting and were not allowed to talkabout it. It was whitewashed and covered up. Makes you wonder who is runningthese UFO and Abduction groups!In fact, the executive director of one of these civilian abduction groups calledme and said he had heard that I had reached this conclusion, that I wasabsolutely correct and that there were a large number of their cases that heknew were military abductions.170But, this fact was being covered up by the founder of this group, and anyone whotried to bring this information out or tried to talk about a positiveinteraction with extraterrestrials was summarily removed. It turns out thisprominent UFO abduction group had dominant funding from Prince S.A.!This is the kind of thing that goes on routinely. And this is why my concern hasalways been the truth and wherever the truth leads us. Unfortunately, there aresome people who have so much of their reputation and belief system wrapped up inthese ideas that they won't let the truth out.Back in the '80s, there was a researcher named Paul Benowitz. An officer in theAir Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) was involved in such a case.A military abductee was directed to Paul Benowitz for the purpose of causing himto go off track on an investigation regarding super secret projects aroundKirkland Air Force Base in New Mexico.A woman, late at night, was driving near one of these secret facilities wherethey were testing an anti-gravity vehicle. She saw something she was notsupposed to see, so a military abduction sequence was initiated. They gave her achemical, she lost consciousness, and then they implanted her. Using advancedMK-Ultra type techniques, these covert operatives then gave her screen memoriesof an ET abduction sequence.She was then directed, through these people, to Paul Benowitz and they startedtargeting him with some of these electromagnetic weapons systems. Hesubsequently had a serious nervous breakdown and had to be hospitalized. It wasa huge tragedy.This all happened because this hapless person saw something she wasn't supposedto see. The cover story was \"an extraterrestrial abduction,\" when, in reality,what she had seen was a testing of an alien reproduction vehicle near KirklandAFB. Some people are just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and rather thanlet it out that secret human projects have anti-gravity propulsion systems, ahoaxed ET abduction occurs as a convenient cover story.During the course of our investigations in the '90s, we identified a few peoplewho have been on these squads. One is a man outside Seattle, Washington andanother one is in Colorado, who was an Army Ranger and had been pulled into oneof these compartmented programs. He said that it was the practice of'stagecraft'. You were only sent on an abduction once, and then they separatedyou.I've asked him to come forward publicly, but he's terrified and he's certainthat he'll be assassinated if he does. He said that they actually had humansdirecting people who were made to look like extraterrestrials. This 'stagecraft'is very advanced and would fool almost anyone that it really was an ET doing theoperation. He said they were using electronics, as well as drugs, to abductpeople.171\"You have no idea how many important political and key military figures have hadeither themselves or their family members abducted by us so they would learn tohate the extraterrestrials and support the Star Wars effort.\"I said, \"Yes, I do believe it,\" I told him, \"because I met with Prince S.A.,whose brother had been abducted through a covert paramilitary operation so thatthis powerful banking family would accept there was a threat. These operationsare extremely well managed, and very sophisticated at the art of deception.\"A number of separate, corroborating people who've been in corporate and militaryintelligence programs have told me the exact same details regarding themodalities that are used and the purpose behind the operations. These hoaxes areperpetrated in other countries, as well.And the purpose is to do exactly what Werner von Braun had warned about: toprepare people for an eventual false threat from outer space that would \"unitethe world\" around a new level of centralized military- industrial-economicpower.Some people in the media, and certain authors, have been targeted with this typeof experience. President Kennedy was assassinated because he got too close tothe truth on this and related matters.172"},{"pageContent":"25 OUT OF THE LOOPPresident Kennedy was assassinated for a constellation of related issues: UFOsand extraterrestrial intelligence are part of a set of problems that include theworld banking system, the intelligence directorates, this shadowy group thatcontrols our society through interlocking corporate, financial and institutionalinterests and corrupt corporate interests in military and government affairs.Jack Kennedy knew a great deal about this and was going to take decisive actionsto try to correct it. He was going to rein in the military industrial complex.He was going to make peace with the Soviets; he was going to end the Cold War.In short, he was going to upset the fascist apple cart. And you have tounderstand that Jack Kennedy also was bright enough to know that Marilyn Monroewas murdered because she was going to talk about some of the things he had toldher about ETs and related issues.Bobby Kennedy certainly knew about these things. I have a letter from BobbyKennedy talking about UFOs and his interest in the subject, written not longbefore he was assassinated.Jack Kennedy, as I understand it from my sources, was in the process, in thefall of 1963, of putting through the federal system an executive order thatwould have altered the dynamics of many of these projects. He was very much infavor of virtually dissolving the CIA. He wanted the UFO matter disclosed andthe technologies used to benefit humanity He wanted to change the course we weretaking in Vietnam. Well, this rogue entity was not going to let all this happen.He was, of course, assassinated before these changes could be effected.A man involved in the Kennedy assassination called me to discuss the UFO andenergy/propulsion matter. This man was involved in the logistics surroundingKennedy's assassination. But he has also been deeply involved in this shadowymeta-government that runs UFO projects and is sitting on the new energy systemsthat could save the world's environment. People who know him will tell you thathe has killed more people than you can count on both your hands and feet. But173now he's working on the reverse engineering projects and dealing with UFO and\"flying saucer\" technology. I've spoken to him a number of times, and I know fora fact that the assassination of Jack Kennedy and the deaths of many people havebeen attributed to trying to stop leaks on this issue.When I met with Lord Hill Norton, in England -- a five-star Admiral, \"sea lord\"and former MOD head — he wanted to know why he was never told anything aboutUFOs. He had heard that I had met with the CIA Director and was briefingClinton's people. I went to his home in Hampshire. It was one of these grand oldhouses with the thick, thatched roofs — a beautiful place. We sat in his livingroom in a couple of wing chairs. He was on my right side and had a little pad ofpaper and was asking me questions, taking notes fastidiously. He wanted to knoweverything I knew. Lord Hill-Norton was an intense, short man with piercing blueeyes.At one point, he asked me, \"Why would they not tell me about this? I was head ofthe Ministry of Defense, and I was also head of MI-5 and MI-6 and all the othersensitive operations in the UK. Plus, I was head of the Military Committee forNATO! Yet I never knew about this when I was in those positions. I only learnedabout it later, and I found out about it from people like Lord Mountbatten. Whywouldn't they tell me?\" He was outraged that he was \"out of the loop,\" just likeAdmiral Tom Wilson, who was head of Intelligence Joint Staff, and just like CIADirector James Woolsey, and on and on and on.I said, \"Well, sir, let me answer your question with a question. What would youhave done if you had found out that there was a trans-national group thatanswered to no government in the world but had infiltrated almost every aspectof every government of any significance in the world; that had arrogated toitself, through a criminal enterprise and ruthless behavior -- including murderand assassinations -illegal control of the most important technologies everdiscovered, including technologies capable of interstellar travel, technologiesthat could take the whole world off the need for fossil fuels, save theenvironment, and end poverty in the world; and that this group had uttercontempt for the rule of law and for democracy and for the freedoms and welfareof the people, or even for the future of Earth? What would you have done?\"He exclaimed, \"I wouldn't have stood for it for one bloody moment!!\" I said,\"And that's why they never told you. You've just answered your own question.\" Heasked, \"Well, what do you mean?\" I said, \"Because if you had known, and thiswould have been your response, you would have ended up like Jack Kennedy or likeLord Mountbatten, blown up by an alleged IRA bomb that was actually set by thisrogue group. And you would have ended up like Marilyn Monroe174and Mary Meyer and all these other people, who were killed for not going alongwith the secrecy. You would have ended up like all the rest of them.\" Then Iadded, \"And like, unfortunately, some of my group— like former CIA Director,Bill Colby.\" He just looked at me. He then muttered something to effect of,\"Those bastards!\".Whether you know or whether you don't know is dependent completely on whether ornot those in this shadowy, covert world think you will go along with whateveramount of secret information you would be exposed to. And if they think you're astand-up guy, who, as soon as you find out how valuable the information is andalso how criminal the enterprise is that's doing this, would try to fix it, theywon't give you this information, because if they do and you step out of line,they're going to have to eliminate you.My military advisor has been in such unacknowledged special access projects andhas described to me how they work. If there are ten people in that project andit's an unacknowledged project, only those ten people know what's going on init. And if you're in that group and you step out of line, he told me that thereis a bullet with your name on it, and it'll find you. And if you are not in thatcell, no matter what your rank and position, you will never know it exists.One of these projects was headed up by Admiral Harry Trane, who later went toSAIC. At a certain point when they were going to close that project so it couldmorph and turn up at another place— just to keep the shell game going— thisAdmiral gathered all the men together and said, \"Thank you very much for yourservices; you have been in an X billion dollar, unacknowledged project, but nowit is time for it to change its form.\" And they shut it down. I am working withmany men who've been in these kinds of projects.One of our witnesses is Merle Shane McDowell. He had been at Atlantic Commandnear Norfolk, Virginia, when an enormous UFO came in out of space, off thenortheastern seaboard, and was eventually tracked on at least five differentmilitary radar stations. It was tracked going up and down the east coast. Thecontrol center where he was located went to what's called a full Code Zebraalert. You have to have zebra stripes on your badge to stay in that facilitywhen they are at this highest stage of alert.Anyone without Zebra stripes who isn't out of the command within 60 seconds willbe shot by Marines stationed there. Admiral Harry Trane was the CINC— theCommander-in-Chief, Atlantic Command— when this happened. Merle Shane McDowelltold me that the Admiral was really upset because this event was out of hiscontrol. The Admiral then ordered the downing of this extraterrestrial vehicleand scrambled jets all up and down the eastern seaboard, trying to intercept it.175But in one sweep of the radarscope, it would move from off the coast of NewEngland to off the coast of Florida, and then one more sweep and the UFO wouldbe off the coast of Norfolk. Eventually, it went out over the Azores. At onepoint they did get a pilot close enough to it to photograph it. And McDowell sawthe photograph of this very large, long, cylindrical-shaped craft. Over theAzores, it turned about 60 degrees and went straight out into space, instantly.In the early 1980s, Admiral Trane, was apparently not in the loop on the UFOmatter, because McDowell says, \"The old man was really shaken.\" He didn't knowwhat this thing was! They were on the hotline to the Soviet Union, trying tofind out if it was a missile or something of theirs. And the Soviets said, \"It'snot ours.\" It was nothing European. It was not American.Later, spooks in suits came in and threatened everyone who had been part of thisencounter. And the threats were serious.One of the reasons I brief many mainstream military commanders about this issueis that those who do not know about the subject could stumble into a similarencounter like this and not know how to respond. Operational readiness is beingundermined by secrecy, by this parallel rogue group who did know, but whowouldn't tell people. Remember: Admiral Trane ordered a military encounter anddowning of an ET craft because, at that time, he did not know what it was! Thisis extremely dangerous and ill-advised.After Adm. Trane left the military, he went through the revolving door of themilitary industrial complex and to the crown jewel of the secret shadowgovernment: Science Applications International Corporation, SAIC.Our military advisor had the opportunity a few years ago to meet with AdmiralTrane, and to bring up this issue. Admiral Trane listened but became very silentand said, \"I am profoundly disinterested in discussing this matter\". He thenpicked up literally the last word of what was being discussed prior to the UFOsubject being brought up and continued on, seamlessly.These people are trained to do this. I have a very dear friend who introduce meto Mrs. Boutros-Ghali, the wife of the Secretary General of the U.N., and anumber of other people. She has been a long-time supporter and member of CSETIand the Disclosure Project. She also has been friends for years with a verysenior Senator. I tipped her off that I was pretty certain he was one of the keyoperatives in this secret rogue group. So, she brought this matter up to him.And he did the following: He listened, looking at her with these intense,eagle-like eyes. When she finished speaking, he brought up the last word of whatwas said prior to her mentioning UFOs and seamlessly continued the conversation.He just snipped the UFO part of it out, as if it was never discussed. She saidit was really amazing.176I, too, have seen this happen with people. This is one way I've been able toidentify the really well-trained, senior people in the shadow government group.A former US President and two former Secretaries of Defense are very deeplyinvolved.In the mid-'90s, I was invited by someone who knew Senator Barry Goldwater todiscuss this at his home. Many of you may remember he was the senator fromArizona who ran for President in the 1964 election and lost. And he was also ageneral in the Air Force Reserves.I went to Sen. Goldwater's home near Scottsdale, AZ, which was up on a hilloverlooking the city. The senator was in his 80s, but quite sharp. He was veryinterested in what we were doing. We had sent all of our briefing materials tohim and he was very grateful.He told me this story: Back in the '60s he was very close friends with GeneralCurtis Lemay —you know, \"Bomb them back to the Stone Age Lemay\".Senator Goldwater, being in the Air Force and a pilot, had heard UFO reportsfrom very credible people that he had known. He had also heard that some of thematerial retrieved from a 'crashed' UFO in New Mexico had ended up atWright-Patterson Air Force Base.Even though Senator Goldwater was a very senior senator, he had never receivedany information on this subject through channels. So, he went to Gen. CurtisLemay and asked the General if he would arrange to get him into the \"blue room\"at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base within the Foreign Technology Division to seethe UFO material. Now, he and Gen. Lemay had always been very amicable, butCurtis Lamay turned to him and said, \"God damn it, Barry. I can't even get intothat area, and if you ever ask me about this again, I will personally see thatyou are court-martialed out of the Air Force!\"This, to a U.S. Senator, U.S. Presidential contender and someone who was in theAir Force Reserves, as a general! I'm sitting in the living room with SenatorGoldwater, and I asked, \"My God, was he serious?\" He said, \"He was serious as aheart attack. And I never brought it up again!\"This story gives you an idea of the fear and the extreme secrecy surroundingthis subject, even to someone of the stature of Barry Goldwater, founder of theconservative wing of the Republican Party. He was arch-conservative,pro-military, red, white, and blue, dyed through and through. And here he wasbeing told by a friend and a fellow general that he would be court-martialed!Sen. Goldwater said, \"I think what you're doing is wonderful.\" He asked, \"Whatcan I do to help you?\" And I said, \"We're trying to put together a coalition ofpeople who know the details of this at a significant enough level so that we candisclose the UFO matter in a credible way to the public and end the secrecy.177The time has come to end this secrecy...\"Goldwater said, \"You've got that right! It was a God damned mistake then, andit's a God damned mistake now that this was ever kept secret!\" So, we startedtalking about who was involved in this secret, shadowy group. As I went througha list of names of the people involved, I finally asked, \"Do you know AdmiralY.N.?\" \"Oh, sure, He and I have been friends for years.\" I said, \"Well, hell,he's like MJ-12 Number 3.\"Goldwater was shocked, \"He is?\"I said, \"Oh, yes.\" Along with people like Edward Teller and folks like that.Edward Teller had key involvement with these projects.He asked, \"Well, what can I do?\" I asked, \"Would you mind contacting the Admiralfor me and asking him if he would meet with me, with the goal of discussing thismatter and exploring how we could cooperate to get this information out to thepublic in a way that would be effective and safe?\" He said \"Well, I'll certainlytry.\" So, he did.A few weeks later, I heard back from Senator Goldwater. He said, \"Oh, my God! Ican't ever bring this up to the Admiral again!\"I was told in so many words that Admiral Y.N. had busted Goldwater over this,and he was not going to discuss this matter with anyone. This Admiral heldseveral very high government positions and, from one of those positions, went onto be one of the chief people at Science Applications International Corporation,SAIC. Get the picture?Admiral Y.N. is certainly a key person -- and has been for decades.I later spoke with Joanne Goldwater, one of Senator Goldwater's daughters, whoheads up Goldwater Foods of Arizona. She said, \"You know, Daddy really can'thelp you get to these people anymore . .. whatever it was that the Admiral saidto him put the fear of God in him.\" I said, \"That's fine. This is a voluntaryassociation and everyone has his limits. I don't ask anybody to do anything thatthey're not comfortable doing, and I appreciate your dad going as far as hedid.\"Around that same time, I learned that Vice President Humphrey had gone secretlyto Kirkland AFB and Sandia Labs, to look into the secret UFO related technologyprojects there. He had learned that there were covert projects working on theextraterrestrial materials. A witness who was at Sandia Labs at the time told mepersonally that he had worked with the UFO projects there and with theextraterrestrial reverse engineering program, specifically the electronics.Vice President Humphrey came to the facility and wanted to come in and see whatwas there. But the Vice-President was told, \"Sir, you are not allowed into thisarea. And if you proceed further, we will shoot to kill.\" I asked this man,178\"Were they serious? They would have shot and killed the Vice President of theUnited States?\" He said, \"Absolutely. He would have been a dead man.\"179"},{"pageContent":"26 THE NEW ERAWhen a Manifestation of God - the Godhead - enters this plane, it invigoratesevery aspect of creation, like a spiritual springtime. There is a renewal ofspirit, knowledge and intellect and what's called a divine plan that isestablished in the deeper realm of spirit, within all things and all beings.It is embedded into the fabric of the creation and literally revives andenlivens all of creation, every atom. Everything is altered. And suddenly\"spontaneously,\" there are enormous breakthroughs in science, social thought,spiritual ideas and the coming together of peoples. All the enormous change andadvancement in science and thought is because this spiritual force and divineplan is unleashed.This new spiritual cycle has established a whole new world. That new cycle-however embryonic is unfolding all around us and within us. But this happenseven as retrograde forces try ferociously and futilely to stop it.Now, it doesn't happen by itself. It happens through us. This is the interestingthing about being a human. A human being, even the least amongst us,nevertheless has the totality of the universe folded within him. We know allthese truths, within us. It's all folded within. In reality, there is nodifference between inner and outer. 'All This is That.'All of us have reached a new potential. There's a new capacity within all beingsin the universe. The cycle we have entered is one of universal peace, not simplyworld peace. The warmongers who are hell bent on thousands of years of galacticwarfare are completely off the mark. No matter how addicted certain retrogradeelements of our society may be to the old paradigm of endless war, that timewill be over shortly - and we will enter a time of unbroken peace for at least500,000 years on earth!Now, we're in the death throes of watching the old paradigm die. It's darkestbefore the dawn, and it's often stormiest before the calm, and it's often mostdifficult and treacherous before a new time like this can be permanentlyestablished. That's the time we're living in: These last 100 to 150 years havewitnessed enormous changes on every level: spiritual, cosmological, social,religious, political, scientific -- everything. 180In the last 150 years, there's been more change than the previous hundredcenturies before it. How did that happen? It happened because this new creationwas manifested through the Godhead at the opening of this cycle. Spiritually, italready exists, in the empyrean realm of celestial knowledge. We can go withinand see it-and it is beautiful!Regarding the secret agenda of those addicted to the old world: Everything is inplay. I've been told by deep insiders that everything is up in the air: It cango either way -- which is why we must strive until our last breath to bringforth this new world of universal peace. The more people have their eyes openabout this deceptive and manipulative agenda the better off we all are, becauseif we know it, we can avoid being stampeded into the folly of Star Wars.Knowledge is power.There's been a lot of manipulation since 9/11, but certain elements haveoverplayed their hand. And by overplaying their hand, people are seeing that ashadowy agenda is operating that has nothing to do with the security of theUnited States or the world. Before 9/11, we were talking about the fact that wehad multiple sources who described the Cold War giving way to these rogue statesand then to global terrorism and then the threat from outer space in the way ofasteroids and extraterrestrial threat. And here we are.It's getting late in the game, but the question is whether or not there areenough people still deceived. And the other question is whether there is stillenough willingness within these covert programs to pull off a cosmic Gulf ofTonkin.There are a lot of people in these projects who don't know what the real agendais. It is highly compartmented. Out of the 200 -300 people in the policy group,globally, who deal with this, there are only a small number of them who knowwhat all of the agendas are. And the worst agendas are the ones I'm discussing.There are about two dozen people who know the plan at that level. It's very,very, very tightly controlled through compartmentalization.One of our most important objectives is to expose the layers of this agenda towell-meaning people in that covert group. There are defections. There are peoplewho are saying, \"I'm not going along with that. I was doing this to keep itsecret so these technologies couldn't be weaponized by our enemies,\" or \"I waskeeping this secret to maintain the stability of the global economic system,\" or\"I was keeping this secret because I wanted to be sure that we didn't suddenlycollapse the oil industry,\". But when they find out about some of these agendas,they say, \"Wait just one minute!\"Out of the many thousands of people involved in these projects, and out of themany hundreds involved in policy management, most are deceived regarding theultimate agenda.181That's why it's very important that we not assume anything about people involvedwith these operations. Many are good people who are themselves beingmanipulated. That's why some of the key people in this group keep calling me andsaying, \"Keep moving this forward; we want this fixed.\" One of them sent me amessage that said, \"Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,never, never, never, never, never, never give up.\"Of course, this is easier said than done: After they've killed your best friendand you have metastatic cancer and you have quit your 'day job' and you havechildren to put through college and you're being called everything but a witchdoctor on the Internet, and on and on and on and on, it is demoralizing andoften hard to keep going. Keeping moving is the most difficult thing.Some people in these super-secret projects are very grateful for what we'redoing. At the beginning of our project there were around a third of thecontrollers involved who wanted to see disclosure; now, it is 45-50 percent. Butthere's still a very powerful element that is ruthless. Former CIA Director BillColby was, in a sense, a test case: People defecting at that level were notgoing to be tolerated.But that was nearly a decade ago and things change. You can never judge thefuture by looking at the past, particularly not at this time. There is so muchevolution occurring. We should view all these people as educable, and they cantransform to a better understanding. Many will come forward and assist us.I have had a recurring, lucid precognitive dream of being at a specific place inthe American Southwest where there's a daytime vectoring and contact with anextraterrestrial vehicle and a very senior spiritual and diplomatic elder of theextraterrestrials emerges. It is a peaceful, open event, and it is beingfacilitated by a friendly component of these covert military programs.This incredible event was shown to me in the early '90s. I think that the chanceof it happening is actually going up as time marches forward.When did all these super secret projects begin? The truth is: There are stillblack projects and materials that have not been de-classified from the turn ofthe last century and World War I!There have been elements of this motif of secrecy that have existed in one wayor another in society for thousands of years. There have always been cartels.There have always been secret societies trying to acquire secret power. And theyhave gone through various transformations, depending on the exigencies of thetime and place and political and technological circumstances.But certainly in the 20th century there have been very covert programs connectedto important industrial interests that have known about these technologies—particularly the so-called free energy electromagnetic systems, which is whatTesla discovered.182Even Faraday had discovered an \"over unity effect\" in some of the experiments hedid, in the 1800s. And so there have been interests that have been keeping thosethings suppressed and quiet for a long, long time.In the 1800s— the era of the Vanderbilts and the Rockefellers and Standard Oil -there were powerful interests that wanted to keep such free energy developmentssecret. At one time, Standard Oil had a greater income than the government ofthe United States. That corporation, controlled by the Rockefeller family, wasthat large and that powerful.Into that monopolistic, industrial environment, geniuses like Tesla or T.Town-send, Brown, and others step. They have so-called zero point energy andfree energy machines, and early high voltage anti-gravity systems.And there were reports of ET craft in the late 1800s - the famous 'air- shipscare' of 1896. I have it from an excellent source that General MacArthuractually was involved in the retrieval of an ET object in China, back in the1930s.So, there have been programs observing the extraterrestrial matter and at thesame time trying to control the technological issue for over 100 years. However,a quantum leap occurred in these programs during the World War II era.Around the time that we developed the knowledge of thermonuclear weapons andwere on the path of early space exploration, there were programs that wereinvestigating propulsion systems that looked like flying saucers. Von Braun wasinvolved, as was Edward Teller, Dr. Vannevar Bush and others. Goddard in 1936and '37 was developing some of Tesla's work; they stole Tesla's anti-gravitywork and sold it to the Nazis in the mid-'30s.But once we moved from that level of experimentation and development into usingthermo-nuclear weapons and covert anti-gravity propulsion, the extraterrestrialpeople who had been watching Earth for thousands of years became very concerned.They knew that there's a very short distance from that point of technologicaldevelopment to the ability to go interstellar. And here is a group of people, onthis beautiful Earth, who, in a few decades, have gone from horse and buggies toanti-gravity, electromagnetic weapons systems, and thermo-nuclear devices. Well,you would have to be galactically brain dead not to be very concerned aboutthis!At that time, during and after WWII, ET reconnaissance and limited interventionincreased. ETs were trying to slow down the pace at which we were going intothis destructive trajectory. We have Disclosure Project military witnesses whodescribe extraterrestrial vehicles intercepting inter-continental ballisticlaunches off of Vandenburg Air Force Base and over the South Atlantic. ETs weretrying to delay our wild push into mutual assured destruction.183People like Colonel Diedrikson, who had been with the Atomic Energy Commission,observed that there was a strong extraterrestrial concern at all our nuclearfacilities. He had personal knowledge of the interception of aninter-continental ballistic missile that had been specially developed so itcould be exploded on the moon. The ETs intercepted it before it could becomeexoatmospheric.By the 1940s, we were actually knocking down extraterrestrial vehicles nearRoswell, New Mexico, which at the time was our only nuclear base. We have an FBIdocument written to J. Edgar Hoover stating that a specially configured radarsystem was responsible for downing those ET craft. By the 1960s we had theability \"to travel among the stars\" as Ben Rich said. Rogue covert projects haddeveloped electromagnetic systems that involved the ability to alterconsciousness and harm people.By the way, Tesla actually had a functioning anti-gravity experiment working andwitnessed before the Wright brothers flew.During President Eisenhower's administration, any semblance of constitutionalityand legality associated with these projects went down the toilet, and it hasbeen out of control ever since. The Shadow Government stabbed Eisenhower in theback.184"},{"pageContent":"27 TRULY QUANTUM, COSMIC MOMENTI have learned from people like Catherine Austin Fitts -- who worked with thefirst Bush presidency, in Housing and Urban Development -- that there is anenormous amount of clandestine funding being siphoned out of every agencythrough dummy programs, into these black projects. When she discovered this,they ran her out of town and tried to destroy her life financially andprofessionally This is a mainstream, credible person who's been in some of thetop investment banking firms in the country She was Assistant Secretary forHousing and Urban Development.As my friends in the Pentagon say \"A billion here and a billion there, andpretty soon you're talking real money.\"Thousands of employees are involved in various projects, but they don't reallyknow the details of what they are working on. Someone might be working on alittle widget here within a compartment that's part of this compartment that'spart of that compartment it's very very tightly controlled. The policy group orcontrol group is 200 to 300 people, and it is trans-national. The United Statesby no means is the only major center of activity There are importantrepresentatives in this group from China, Latin America, The Vatican, variousinstitutes, Europe, Russia. National boundaries, actually, mean nothing.National issues are irrelevant. It's not even about government as you and Inormally think of it. It is centered in corporate, financial, transnational, andreligious interests; they are the tail wagging the dog of government. The singlemost powerful entity within this group today is the corporate Mormon empire. TheMormon hierarchy has vast financial and corporate holdings linked to thesecovert programs, but the \"rank and file\" wittingly have nothing to do with it.Enforcement: you know, I always tell people, \"Oh, the CIA? Those guys arepussycats.\" The ones you've got to worry about are the contract guys who workfor Lockheed or E-Systems or the ones that are contracted from this group thatare attached to what are called the Devil's Disciples, which is a motorcyclegang.185It’s a sub-section of the Hell's Angels that routinely engage in torture andhuman sacrifice and vivisection -- where they cut you open alive -- in order toenforce secrecy in certain settings.I know a man who is an energy researcher who worked with a victim of the Devil'sDisciples. They wear necklaces that have a tooth from each person they've killedon it. So, they knocked his teeth out and eviscerated him, and left him to die,but he survived. Today, he is a very antisocial person and doesn't want to havemuch to do with humans.The Devil's Disciples are working under contract from some of these roguecriminal enterprises that are involved with the hard-core end of the secrecy.Much of the security is outsourced to entities like Wackenhut for traditionalsecurity. But then there are these non-traditional enforcers.A covert ops guy I know in Arizona acquired the Carp tape, where what appears tobe either an alien reproduction vehicle or an actual ET craft went out ofcontrol and crash-landed near a military facility in Canada.During the retrieval operation, one of the special teams involved filmed thelanded craft. The person who made this film was doing it clandestinely; it's avery shaky film. I have it. It came to me with some photographs of what lookedlike some ET life forms.This film and the man who shot it made their way to a person who is black opsbut presents himself as a concerned UFO researcher and digital image analyst. Sohe gave this person who made the film a 'safe house' on his ranch in Arizona.Well, I'm not sure that it was a safe house at all. One day, this 'protector'came back out to the ranch -- and hammered to the mailbox of the ranch was abaggy with a finger in it, with a little piece of paper that said, \"TWEP\" --terminate with extreme prejudice. They never found this person, and it ispresumed that he was killed. The owner of the ranch told me this story.The people who are in these key roles are often there because they have beenbrought along, inter-generationally — that is from one generation to another.For example, I mentioned James Jesus Angleton, who signed off on the wiretap ofMarilyn Monroe. I was contacted by a descendant, who is enormously wealthy andinvolved in this covert group, but not with the Agency. Everything important isoutside the Agency, in the private world.After the Disclosure Project event, he called me up and said, \"You've moved ourtimeline of bringing this information out up by six to 12 years.\" I said,\"Good.\" He added, \"We're looking at this material with NATO; there is acompartmented operation within NATO headquarters that deals with this, inEurope.\"He explained, \"But what we're planning to do -- and we would like for you tocooperate with this -- is that in a few years, we're planning to have the keypolitical military and religious leaders of the world announce that ETs havebeen detected and we have evidence that we're not alone and that there areextraterrestrials.\"186I said, \"It's a bit late in the day for that, don't you think?!\"He was trying to talk me into delaying disclosure to match their time-table. Ofcourse, I have been approached this way before - remember General T.E.. I said,\"My concern is that in delaying Disclosure, there would be an opportunity tofurther consolidate power around an agenda that is the antithesis of thedirection the Earth should be taking.\" The more sympathetic members of thisgroup -- including this gentleman, Angleton - are open to getting thisinformation out sooner rather than later. There is so much spy-versus-spy goingon within the Shadow Government, and there are so many factions, and shiftingalliances: It's an extremely dynamic situation. People have a tendency to viewthis covert control group as monolithic and fixed, but it isn't. It's verydynamic, even fractured.We have significant protection around the Disclosure project from unusualplaces. Since 1998, none of our military witnesses have even been told, \"Bequiet.\" Not one. None of them have been threatened. I met with a cell of theShadow Government, prior to the 2001 Disclosure Project National PressConference. I said, \"Please make your people aware of the following: We welcomeyour assistance, or you may be neutral. But if you harm one hair on the head ofany of these men or women or anyone associated with the projects or even make athreat in that regard, or should I step off a curb in Washington on the way to ameeting and get hit by a metro bus, there will be serious consequences.\" Theyknew we meant it. We have extraordinary spirit warriors who protect us - onearth and elsewhere. It does not mean we are invincible - far from it. But it isa check and balance, and it is just.There can be no promises. All I know is that all that can be done is being done.Since my near-death experience at age 17, I have had a very differentperspective on what this life is about. It has informed everything I've done. Weare here briefly, but our lives are eternal. We must walk our path - fulfill ourdestiny - and in that there is meaning.So, I put aside my work as an emergency doctor, and dedicated myself to thiswork. I will admit to deeply missing the hands-on taking care of patients. Butnow I have to view Earth and her children as my patients, and do the best I canto take care of them...It is worth the sacrifice, because the time we live in is setting the directionfor the next half a million years of human evolution. We live in a truly quantumcosmic moment.It is somewhat ironic that people often ask, \"Aren't you concerned when one ofthese UFOs is nearby, that something might harm you?\" I say, \"No, except to theextent that there are other people nearby.\"187The threat is always coming from humans, not extraterrestrials. We have manycases where people pulled out their guns and started shooting at a UFO, noquestions asked!And in some cases, they have attempted to shoot CSETI teams. In Mexico in Marchof '97, out of the five nights we were out doing contact work, four of thosenights we were assaulted by armed police who were really just roving bands ofbandits, extorting money from people.On one particular night, near Atlimayaya, we set up near an old fort, at thebase of the volcano. Suddenly we saw a police car sneaking up on us with armedpolice walking in front of the car, rifles drawn.I mentally saw a flash that they were going to rob us and kill us. We were in ameditative state and so we called on the Divine Being for protection. Wespecifically focused peace and divine protection on the police.Initially, the police were agitated and hostile - very threatening. But theywent from that state to being almost placid, instantly. They inexplicably satdown, put their guns down, pulled out a guitar from the police car, and startedplaying the guitar!I turned to our group and I said, \"In one seamless movement, pick up everythingyou have, get in our car, and we're leaving.\" We did this like our livesdepended on it, then briefly said, \"Adios,\" as they were playing the guitar. Itwent from a situation that was extremely frightening to one that was extremelypeaceful, through the effect of a divine calming influence.We got in the car and then, at enormous speed, I drove our group back into thecompound where we were staying. We didn't know how long they would be in thatplacid, dream-like state. They were armed, cocked, ready to go — and I wasdetermined to get us to safety.But this shows how the divine, cosmic Being can change a situation,mysteriously, quickly, if we will call on that Power.188"},{"pageContent":"28 UNRAVELING THE MATRIXWe moved our family from Asheville, North Carolina to Thomas Jefferson'sAbemarle County Virginia in the spring of 1998.We had given from 1993 until 1998- five years- for the executive branch, thePresident, the military the international community, and Congress to act. Theywere either frightened or corrupted.We expanded our call for witnesses to come forward. We went from a dozen or sopeople in the early 1990s, to over 400 military, government and corporateinsiders. Without a staff, without an office and without a significant budget,we put the Disclosure together. In 1998 we estimated that we would need betweentwo and three million dollars to be able to do the research, world-wide travel,filming, archiving, processing, setting up the National Press Club event,arrange for a PR firm and launch Disclosure.When the Disclosure Project was being ramped-up in 2000, a woman got involved.She said, \"Okay we'll fund this effort in exchange for having an interest in adocumentary with the witnesses...,\". She claimed she was willing to fund theeffort up to $2 million.Well, within about a month or two, she started reneging on everything. I had puteverything on my credit cards: the equipment, traveling to Europe to filmwitnesses there, etc. But she wouldn't pay it. She had no integrity for her wordor her signature. So, I got stuck with over $10,000 on my personal credit cards!So Disclosure started in June of 2000 and then was stopped again in August of2000. For historical purposes, it's important to give people an idea of the kindof chicanery we have encountered.I was so disgusted by that point, having gone through what I call \"Murder,Incorporated\", now we have this kind of bait-and-switch double cross! Havinggone through cancer, the loss of Shari and Bill Colby, survived that, moved toVirginia, trying to keep body and soul together, left my medical profession—then we have this kind of cruel betrayal, at the moment that the project hadbeen publicly announced! It was almost too much to take...189I was about to shut down all of these projects in August of 2000. And then alongcomes Dr. Jan Bravo. Jan made a substantial donation to the Disclosure Projectwhich enabled us to cover all the out of pocket expenses to get the May, 2001Disclosure event completed. If it hadn't been for Jan, there's no question atall, I would have pulled the plug on the entire project. So, thank you, Jan.Once we got back on track, I traveled around with a camera, filming witnessesmostly on my own. Now, anyone who knows me and machines has to laugh! Forgetlevitating a car. That's easy. Getting me, the biggest mechanical moron onPlanet Earth, to operate a digital camera by myself, now that's a real miracle!I have no problem intubating someone who's just been shot through the neck or,de-fibrillating a heart. But a digital video camera!Once we had identified enough of these resources, catalogued them and put themin a database, we set a date for the event. It was an enormous undertaking donewith minimal resources and all volunteers.We had over 110 hours of videotaped testimony, from the former USSR to Spain andItaly and England to France and Latin America and all over the United States. Wehave insider testimony from every agency and from every era— from the '40s rightup to the '90s.I had to take all the original digital videotape and using a dual G-4 Applecomputer and a simple video editing program, go through all the videotape, editit, make the cuts and create a log for every scene and every witness. I did thisall myself, because someone who knew the whole picture had to do the cut.I edited the 110 hours of testimony down to about 35 hours. And then I took the35 hours and edited it down to about 18 hours. Those 18 hours were given to JeffThill, God bless him, and in his free time (working full time at Laser Pacificand raising two young children) took the 18 hours and created the DisclosureProject videos. We had no budget for it. This was achieved only by donatedlabor, material and real dedication.Also, the 35 hours of videotape were used to create 35 hours of audiotape. Thataudiotape was then given to a transcription service that transcribed it intotext. That text was then loaded onto disks that I put on my laptop computer.It was 1,200 pages of transcripts! That had to be boiled down to what became theDisclosure book --that also had to include all the government documents andother documentation and position papers. And I had to write all that and all thetransition pieces in about 2 months to create a 600-page book. It was anall-consuming undertaking.We engaged the National Press Club and Sarah McClendon, the famed White Housecorrespondent, was our official host.190When we launched this event at the National Press Club, all we could afford wasa one-woman shop for a PR agent. I wrote all the press releases and she and Ibegan to notify the press that this important event involving dozens oftop-secret military witnesses to UFO events was about to happen. We lit up thesystem and everybody was waiting for this event to happen on May 9th, 2001.\"We'll get the little Holloman room for this event...It's all you'll need.\"\"Oh, no - we need the ballroom.\"\"But that room is never used — except for very large and important events.\"\"This will be a very large and important event!\" \"You've got to be out of yourmind.\"\"No, we need the entire ballroom!\"\"Well, the last time they filled the ballroom was when President Reagan wasthere!\" \"Just get it. Do it.\"\"Okay — you won't listen to me . . . but I'll get it.\"The day of Disclosure, she was so glad we had the ballroom, because it waspacked with 22 cameras at the back of the room and the entire media. About 20 ofthese military and government related witnesses were present.Connect Live is the official web-cast and internet hosting entity for theNational Press Club - and also for CNN and the Pentagon. They were engaged towebcast the entire event, live.Well, the president of Connect Live told me after the event that as we wentlive, the first hour of the testimony was externally, electronically jammed! Hehad never seen this happen! Now, we knew there would be an attempt by the NSA tojam the webcast, and our security had seen activity to that effect the nightbefore -logistics being set up. As it turned out, the webcast got back up afteran hour and it ended up being the most watched web-cast in the history of theinternet! The people at Connect Live later pulled me in and showed me the bandwidth that was used: \"This event used up every T-1 line - we have never seenthis kind of volume for a news webcast!\" The number of people viewing the eventlive was half a million people — and they do not know how many people tried toget on but were unable to connect.Ultimately, the whole two-hour press conference was viewed by over three millionpeople. It was covered briefly by various news agencies— CNN and BBC and mostother major news groups.The general manager of the National Press Club was stunned at the number of newspeople present. News networks were canceling other programming and were heardsaying, \"This is the real X Files!\" There was enormous excitement.191This event beta-tested the National Security shadow government control on thisissue and over the media. It was interesting to see how they would handle it.Well, word of this event got out. Ultimately, between the interviews on the BBCand the Wee of America and all the other media coverage, hundreds of millionsheard about it. The National Press Club staff thought we had amulti-million-dollar budget and a huge staff. But all we had was the incrediblededication of our volunteers!When they found out that there wasn't a single paid person there except this onetemporary PR woman, they couldn't believe it. The general manager of theNational Press Club said, \"Well, this is the most organized event that's everbeen here!\" They also told us that it was the best attended press event at theNational Press Club since Ronald Reagan had been in the building.The media was allowed to cover a certain amount of this event, or it would havebeen too obvious of a cover-up. But then they took it off the airwaves veryquickly. So, it went up on CNN Headline News briefly, and CNN Internationalactually had a very significant amount of coverage in Europe. Pravda and theChinese news agency also covered it.But what was interesting was to see the lack of follow-through with the bigmedia organizations -- such as the \"Wall Street Journal\", who interviewed me,and the big news magazines and others. They would say, \"This is really asignificant event!\" And then later they would get back to me and they would say,\"Well, 'they' won't let us run with this story...\" Ira Rosen, Executive Producerof ABC News, had been a key investigator for Mike Wallace at \"60 Minutes\" andhad won an Emmy for his work. He had been involved for a year or so with what wewere doing and had been at our home for meetings. He'd been through all thematerials. We'd given him enormous amounts of documents, testimony, andinformation. He wanted to do a very strong \"Prime Time Live\" and \"20/20\" piece,if not a series, on this. But after this national press event, he called andsaid, \"Well, it looks like I'm not going to be able to do this story.\" I asked,\"Why not?\" He says, \"They won't let me put it on. They won't let me do thispiece.\" I asked, \"Who's 'they'?\" He said, \"Well, Dr. Greer, you know who theyare...\"He told my wife and me, while he was at our home having lunch, that he hadcredible information that they couldn't 'go with' regarding shadowy FBIinterests that had shot Martin Luther King. Rosen had been involved in gettingto the bottom of that — but they also never ran that story. So it wasinteresting to see how ABC ultimately had to back off covering the UFO subject.There was enormous pres-192sure brought to bear not to let this get too much traction.The covert controllers knew that if the major news groups started pulling thisyarn and unraveling it, the whole cover-up would come undone. We have enoughassets and enough information to unravel the whole matrix. And certainly, theinterests that want to keep this secret know this and brought pressure to bearto kill the in-depth follow-up stories.Imagine what we could achieve if we had any real significant institutionalsupport or funding! If we had had five or ten million dollars, we could havecompletely ended the secrecy.A lot of this now is in the hands of the public; the information is there.People can put the testimony on cable access channels or show it in theircommunities. And this is happening all over the world.The day after the National Press Club event, one of our military witnesses wasoutside the White House and had a Disclosure Project identification badge on.Andy Card, who is the Chief of Staff of the President, came out and saw it, andsaid, \"Oh, the Disclosure Project. We've been watching this... Good luck withthat!\" This Disclosure military witness then gave Andy Card a briefing file,which Card then carried right into the White House! The \"Washington Times\" had abig half-page article about it, and that's the paper of record for theRepublicans and certainly what they read at the White House.The afternoon of the press conference, we began meeting with various members ofCongress. I personally gave Senator Ted Kennedy the whole briefing document.Congressman Kucinich, who is head of the progressive caucus in the Congress,invited us to his office for a sit-down briefing. There were nine of us whoarrived immediately after the Disclosure Project National Press Club event. Hesat with all of us and asked each witness to share a very short vignette of whatthey knew about the UFO matter.After everyone had shared, he turned to me and looked me in the eyes and said,\"I have to tell you that in all my years in Congress, I have never felt anenergy and a spirit like I have today when you all walked through these doors.\"Then he said, \"The fact that you are here tells me that time is short.\" He wasthe most perceptive government leader I have ever met— and certainly the mostenlightened.There are many people in the Congress who know what we're doing and arefollowing it closely. We met with numerous members of Congress that week. JohnCypher, the actor who introduced me at the National Press Club, and Carol Rosin,met with Daniel Golden, who at the time was the head of NASA. Golden came toNASA from Science Applications International Corporation. (Hmmmm — aninteresting pattern develops....)193We continue to have meetings periodically with members of Congress about this.Congressman Virgil Goode, who is the Congressman for my home district, was onthe House National Security Committee, and met with me for an hour, privately.He said, \"I have been reading about what you've been doing, for some time— a lotof us have.\"Then he said, \"But, you know, there's another group that really runs the show.It's very shadowy, just as you've described. And we're [members of Congress]window dressing.\" He flat out told me: \"Those of us in the Congress of theUnited States are window dressing.\" And I said, \"Well, yes, sir, I know that. Onthe other hand, you have enough power to do something, if you collectivelychoose to do it.\" And we had a discussion about that. Towards the end of themeeting he said, \"I really need to see the technologies. And that's what a lotof us are waiting for. What you need to do next is put together something thatproves the technologies behind the phenomenon.\" I've heard this from a number ofCongressmen.Congressman Goode and I also discussed the extent to which the media is corruptand controlled: If anyone did try to step out on this matter— just asCongressman Schiff had— he would be cut off, ridiculed, and attacked. So, itisn't that there are no people in the Congress who are supportive of Disclosure-- there really are. But they feel like they don't have the ability to do whatthey would like to, because of the structural obstacles that are in place tocontain Disclosure, the worst of which is the corruption and control of the massmedia.The big media is completely corrupted, infiltrated by the worst elements of thiscontrol group and is no more free, here in the United States, than the ChineseNews Agency. In fact, the Chinese News Agency and Pravda did a better jobreporting what we're doing than the \"Washington Post\", \"Newsweek\", \"Time\", etc.The only free press is the insignificant press. And this is something peoplenever think about. People say, \"Well, you can say anything.\" I say, \"Yes, youcan put it on the Internet, where it gets ignored and lost in all the digitalflotsam, or you can put it in some insignificant journal. But when you'retalking about the big media, big Hollywood, big publishing, big newspapers, bigelectronic media and TV -- they are completely corrupted and controlled byshills for the secret government.The large media empires have been horizontally and vertically integrated intothe corporate trans-national shadow entity that maintains secrecy. The fox isguarding the henhouse. Bob Schwartz, who had been on the board of Time-Life,flat out said that the media have become scribes sitting at the right hand ofthe king, taking dictation. He said this to me in the early '90s, in New York.So we have no 'Fourth Estate' that's meaningful. The checks and balances thatthe founding fathers of America envisioned have been gone for decades.194A few prestigious well placed people are also used to control the spin of thisinformation. One of the people Y.H. introduced me to after the 2001 Disclosureevent in San Francisco was a man who is a very wealthy European financier andhotelier. He had just been at the Bohemian Grove - a retreat in California nearthe Russian River where the world power elites gather for meetings andrecreation - with about 2,500 of the world's most prominent people.This meeting was happening at the same time the Disclosure Project was beingrolled out, with a multi-city tour. This man told us very influential peoplewere asking about the Disclosure Project at this Bohemian Grove gathering.To quell this interest, the control group got a prestigious member of thegathering to go on stage and tell everyone that he had been on the inside ofthese investigations for the government, and that there was nothing to it! Itwas, in fact, all swamp gas and misapprehension of explainable meteorites andnatural phenomena. And this wealthy man who had attended the meeting asked me,\"Why would they have someone of that stature address us at the same time you'rehaving this meeting with 1,000 people in San Francisco?\" I said, \"Because theyoperate by having a few 'respectable' people in every organization function asvectors of disinformation— whether it's the Bildebergers or CFR or theTriLateral Commission or the Senate or the Vatican. Most of the people involvedwith these groups know nothing about these matters!\" The conspiracy theoristsare all wrong about how things are controlled. Masons -- virtually none of themknow about this subject. Burl Ives knew little beyond what I told him. And hewas a 32nd-degree Mason.But there are always a few who do know, and it is their role to go to theirpeerage- because they have their trust and their respect-, and say, \"None ofthis could be true, and you can trust me. I'm your buddy. I'm one of you.\" It'sthe country club mentality. They belong to the same peerage, and they're peopleof stature. But in reality such figures are on the payroll as assets of thisshadowy group.That is how the secrecy is maintained. It's actually very simple. And it'snowhere near as conspiratorial as many people would suppose. You don't need manyof these control points if they're people of stature and have \"high credibilityand visibility\". All they need to do is say, \"None of this is true, and if itwere true, you know I would tell you.\" Right.195"},{"pageContent":"29 WITNESS TESTIMONYFollowing is a tiny fraction of the testimony obtained from the military,government and corporate witnesses interviewed for The Disclosure Project.

And you had access to special libraries. Soone of the things that we could do is go up to the library that the Air Forceran and sort of paw through top- secret material. Since I was interested inUFOs, when I had some usual business to take care of, I'd also look in theirlibrary to see what they had on UFOs. And for about a year I was getting quite afew hits on the subject about various reports. Then all of a sudden, the wholesubject material vanished. The entire classification for the subject justvanished. The librarian in our group that I was working with said he'd been inthat vault for twenty years and knew exactly how things were normally done. Hesaid, this is remarkable. He said, I've never seen that before, you just don'thave a whole subject vanish out from under you.

Now wehave the Internet and video and all those other sorts of things.

At the time I said, well I don't know why you are sayingthis. I mean, there was something there and if it's not the stealth bomber, thenyou know, it's a UFO. And if it's a UFO, why wouldn't you want the people toknow? Oh, they got all excited over that. You don't even want to say thosewords. He said this is the first time they ever had 30 minutes of radar data ona UFO. And they are all itching to get their hands onto the data and to find outwhat it is and what really goes on. He says if they come out and told theAmerican public that they ran into a UFO out there, it would cause panic acrossthe country. So therefore, you can't talk about it. And they are going to takeall this data...\"When the CIA told us that this never happened and we never had this meeting, Ibelieve it was because they didn't want the public to know that this was goingon.

And they'dkeep screaming that until I finally hung up the phone.\"One night somebody blew up my mail box by putting a big load of skyrockets init. The mailbox went up in flames.

Some time after I had gone, theguys in civilian clothes — I thought it was the CIA but he said no, it wasn'tthe CIA, it was somebody else- took the film and they spooled off the part thathad the UFO on it and they took a pair of scissors and cut it off. They put thaton a separate reel. They put it in their briefcase. They handed Major Mansmannback the rest of the film and said, \"Here, I don't need to remind you, Major, ofthe severity of a security breach; we'll consider this incident closed.\" Andthey walked off with the film. Major Mansmann never saw it again.\"Radar and Pilot Cases:JC: Chief John Callahan SG: Dr. Steven GreerJC: ...Now in the 747 they have radar in the nose that picks up the weatheroutside there. So his radar is picking up a target. He sees this target with hiseyes. And the target, the way he described it, was a huge ball with lightsrunning around it. And I think he said it was like four times as big as a 747!And the military man said something like, yeah, I see him 35 miles north ofAnchorage...The UFO was bouncing around the 747 here. And when he would say that, themilitary guy would cut in and say, he's now at 2:00 or 3:00 and he would confirmthe position. The military controller has, what they call, height-finding radar,and they have long-range radar and short- range radar. So if they don't catch iton one of their systems they catch it on the other. And if you listen to themilitary man, at one time he said, I have it on the height radar, or my rangeradar, which indicated that they had a target on his system. Well they ranthrough for the best part of 31 minutes...Then the next day I got a call from someone with the Scientific Study Group [forPresident Reagan], or the CIA, I'm not sure who it was, the first call. And theyhad some questions about the incident. And I had said, I don't know what you aretalking about, you probably want to call the Admiral [FAA Administrator Engen].Well a few minutes later the Admiral calls down and says, I have set up abriefing tomorrow morning at 9:00 am in the round room. Bring all the stuff youhave. Bring everybody up there and give them whatever they want. We want to getout of it. Just let them do whatever they want. So I brought all the people fromthe Tech Center.200We had all kinds of boxes of data that we had them print out; it filled up theroom. They brought in three people from the FBI, three people from the CIA, andthree people from Reagan's Scientific Study team—I don't know who the rest ofthe people were but they were all excited...When they got done, they actually swore all these other guys in there that thisnever took place. We never had this meeting. And this was never recorded.The only ones that see a UFO in the TV programs are the rednecks out in thecountry that are going coon hunting or alligator hunting at night. You don'tfind anybody with any kind of smarts or some professional individual saying hey,last night let me tell you what I saw. They don't display that in the UnitedStates. So if you talk about seeing a UFO, you are putting yourself in a funnykind of category. That's probably one of the reasons why you don't hear about itanymore. But as far as I'm concerned, I saw a UFO chase a Japanese 747 acrossthe sky for over half an hour on radar. And it's faster than anything that Iknow of in our Government.It still bothers me that I've seen all this, I know all this, and I'm walkingaround with the answer, and nobody wants to ask the question to get the answer.And it kind of irritates me a little bit. And I don't believe our Governmentshould be set up that way. I think when we have something like this, that youcan probably find out more about what's going on in the world [by not coveringit up]. If they [the UFOs] can travel that far, that distance with that type ofmachinery, who knows what they could do here for the health of the nation, thepeople, the food they could give them, the cancers we could cure. They have toknow more than us to be able to travel at that speed.For those people that say that if these UFOs existed, they would some day be onradar and that there'd be professionals who would see it, then I can tell themthat back in 1986 there were enough professional people that saw it. It wasbrought down to headquarters, FAA headquarters, Washington D.C. TheAdministrator saw the tape of it. The people that we were debriefing, they'veall seen. Reagan's Scientific Study team, three of those professors, doctors,they've seen it. As far as I was concerned they were the ones that verified myown thoughts about it. They were very, very excited about the data. They hadsaid that this was the only time a UFO was ever recorded on radar for any lengthof time where it is 30 some minutes. And they have all this data to look at...What I can tell you is what I've seen with my own eyes. I've got a videotape.I've got the voice tape. I've got the reports that were filed that will confirmwhat I've been telling you. And I'm one of those, what you would call the highGovernment officials in the FAA. I was a Division Chief. I was only three orfour down from the Admiral...201SAC/ NukeLieutenant Colonel Bob Salas:... \"The UFO incident happened on the morning of March 16, 1967. I was on dutyalong with my commander Fred Mywald. We were both on duty at Oscar Flight aspart of the 490th strategic missile squad and there are five launch controlfacilities assigned to that particular squadron. We were at Oscar Flight.It was still dark out and we're sixty feet underground [at the ICBM launchcontrol facility]. It was early in the morning and I received a call from mytopside security guard who's the flight security controller and he said that heand some of the guards had been observing some strange lights flying around thesite around the launch control facility. He said they were acting very unusualjust flying around, and I said, \"You mean UFO? He said, well, he didn't knowwhat they were but they were lights and were flying around. They were notairplanes; they weren't making any noise. They were not helicopters; they weremaking some very strange maneuvers and he couldn't explain it...\"It wasn't more than a few minutes- maybe a half hour later- and he calls backand this time he's very frightened; I can tell by the tone of his voice he'svery shook up. He says, \"Sir, there's a glowing red object hovering rightoutside the front gate—I'm looking at it right now. I've got all the men outhere with their weapons drawn...\"I immediately went over to my commander who was taking a nap— we have a littlecot down there for rest periods—and I was telling him about the telephone callwe just received. As I was relating this to him our missiles started shuttingdown one by one. By shutting down, I mean they went into a \"no-go\" conditionmeaning they could not be launched. So we get bells and whistles—a red lightno-go condition...These weapons were Minuteman One missiles and were of course nuclear-tippedwarhead missiles.As they started shutting down, immediately he gets up and we both start queryingthe status board. We've got the ability to query and determine what the cause ofthe shutdowns was. As I recall, most of them were guidance and control systemfailures. And then he started reporting to the command post. In the meantime Icalled upstairs to find out what the status was of this object and the guardsaid, well, the object has left—it just left at high speed...The Air Force did an extensive investigation of the entire incident and was notable to come up with a probable cause for the shutdowns. And I've got quite afew witnesses that will testify to that—we've got a couple of people202who worked on the investigative team—and I've got correspondence from the manwho actually organized the investigative team. There was no viable explanationfor this [shutdown of multiple ICBMs]. Each missile is basicallyself-supporting. Most of them are powered by commercial power but each missilehas its own power generator. ..At our site anywhere from six to eight went down but they went down in rapidsuccession which again is an extremely rare happening. We rarely had more thanone missile go down for any reason at all...After I talked to my guard upstairs, my commander talked to the command post.When he finished talking to the command post he turned to me and said, \"The samething occurred at ECHO Flight.\" ECHO Flight is another squadron, I'd sayprobably 50 - 60 miles away from our location but they had the same sort ofthing happen. They had UFOs that were hovering, not at the launch controlfacility but at the actual launch facilities where the missiles are located.They had some maintenance and security people out there at the time and theyobserved the UFOs at those sites. Now they lost all ten of their weapons—allten…It was the same morning. So that morning we lost anywhere from between 16 to 18ICBMs at the same time UFOs were in the area and were observed by airmen. Thosemissiles were down the entire day because we've got testimony from Colonel DonCrawford, who relieved the crew at ECHO Flight and he was there when themissiles were being brought up to alert status and he said it took the wholeday. So I'm assuming it took our missiles all day to be brought back up also...I wrote up a report about this incident; it was in my log and I turned it in.When we got to the base we had to report to our squadron commander right away.And in that room with my squadron commander was a fellow from AFOSI (we had anAir Force Office of Special Investigations on the base). He was there in theoffice with the commander. He asked for my logs and he wanted a quick briefingalthough it seemed to me he knew pretty much what had happened already. But wegave him a quick briefing and then he asked us both to sign a nondisclosureagreement saying this was classified information- we were not to release this toanybody, and that was it. We couldn't talk; he told us we could not talk aboutthis to anyone, including any of the other crews, our spouses, our family, evenamongst each other...I've got a copy of a telex which we received under FOIA coming from SACheadquarters and coming to Malstrom and other bases right after the morning thathappened saying that this incident was of extreme concern to SAC headquartersbecause they couldn't explain it. Nobody could explain what happened. And yet wenever got de-briefed. And we were cleared for very high classification becausethese are nuclear weapons we're dealing with.203We did get the security incursion alarms at those sites when the missile wentdown. That is unusual because usually when a missile went down for somethinglike guidance failure, we wouldn't get security incursion alarms, which means aperimeter is breached, an object crossed the fence, or something broke thesecurity alarm system that we had on the perimeter of the launch facility. I didsend out guards to a couple of those facilities to investigate that.The reason I think this story is very significant is because, going back toAugust of 1966 at Minot, ND, a very similar thing happened at one of the launchcontrol facilities at Minot Air Force Base. They had the same kind of weaponsystem that we had—they had M-1 missiles. This [UFO] was observed on radar,there was some communication failure and the object was observed over the launchcontrol facility.That happened in August 1966 and that's a well-documented incident. About a weekprior to my incident, in March 1967, I've got a record of a call from one of thesecurity guards who was out roaming looking at the launch facilities and saw anobject very similar to what I just described over the launch facility...Bob Kominski headed up the organization to look at all aspects of theseshutdowns. Kominski relates to me in writing that at some point he was told byhis boss that the Air Force said, \"Stop the investigation; do no more on thisand in addition do not write a final report.\" Again, this is very unusualespecially in light of the fact that CINC-SAC headquarters was stating that thiswas of extreme importance to find out exactly what happened here. And yet, thehead of the investigative team was told during the investigation to stop theinvestigation and not write a final report...Professor Robert Jacobs: Lt. US Air ForceWe sent the (UFO) film back down to the base and- I don't know exactly how longit was after the event, it might have been a day or two— I was called into MajorMansmann's office at the First Strategic Aerospace Division Headquarters. Iwalked into his office and they had a screen and a 16mm projector set up. Therewas a couch and Major Mansmann said, \"Sit down.\" And there were two guys in graysuits, civilian clothes, which was fairly unusual. Major Mansmann said, \"Watchthis\" and turned on the film projector. I watched the screen and there was thelaunch from the day or two before...We watched the third stage burnout. And then on that telescope we could see thedummy warhead. It's flying along and into the frame came something else. It flewinto the frame like and it shot a beam of light at the warhead.Now remember, all this stuff is flying at several thousand miles an hour.204So this thing [UFO] fires a beam of light at the warhead, hits it and then it[the UFO] moves to the other side and fires another beam of light, then movesagain and fires another beam of light, then goes down and fires another beam oflight, and then flies out the way it came in. And the warhead tumbles out ofspace. The object, the points of light that we saw, the warhead and so forth,were traveling through subspace about 60 miles straight up. And they were goingsomewhere in the neighborhood of 11,000 to 14,000 miles an hour when this UFOcaught up to them, flew in, flew around them, and flew back out.Now, I saw that! I don't give a Goddamn what anybody else says about it. I sawthat on film! I was there!Now when the lights came on, Major Mansmann turned around looked at me and said,\"Were you guys screwing around up there?\" And I said, \"No, sir.\" And he said,\"What was that?\" And I said, \"It looks to me like we got a UFO.\" Now the thingthat we saw, this object that flew in, was circular, was shaped like two saucerscupped together with a ping- pong ball on top. The beam of light came out of theping-pong ball. That's what I saw on film.Now Major Mansmann said to me after some discussion about it, you are never tospeak of this again. As far as you are concerned, this never happened. And hesaid, \"I don't need to emphasize the dire consequences of a security breach, doI?\" I said, \"No, sir.\" And he said, \"Fine. This never happened.\" As I startedfor the door, he said, \"Wait a minute.\" He said, \"Years from now if you are everforced by someone to talk about this, you are to tell them it was laser strikes,laser tracking strikes...\"It's not a secondhand story. This happened to me. And I was a part of a UnitedStates Air Force cover-up for 18 years.Colonel Ross Dedrickson: US Air Force/AEC (ret.)Colonel Dedrickson is a retired Colonel from the USAF. He went to Stanfordbusiness school where he studied management. Back in the 1950's part of hisresponsibilities included maintaining the inventory of the nuclear weaponstockpile for the AEC and accompanying security teams checking out the securityof the weapons. Many reports kept coming in that UFOs were seen at variousnuclear storage facilities and some of the manufacturing plants. He has seenthem himself many times and was present when the famous fly-over over theCapital happened in July of 1952. At that incident he recalls seeing nineilluminated disc-type craft. He also tells of at least two occasions whereextraterrestrials destroyed nuclear weapons headed out to space, one heading tothe moon to be detonated for tests. It was destroyed because \"nuclear weapons inspace ... were not acceptable to the extraterrestrials...\"205Government Insiders/ NASA/ Deep InsidersMerle Shane McDow:US Navy Atlantic CommandMr. McDow entered the Navy in 1978 and gained a top-secret, SpecialCompartmented Intelligence (SCI) clearance with a Zebra Stripes. He was assignedto the Atlantic Operational Support Facility, Atlantic Command, then underAdmiral Trane. Mr. McDow was present when a UFO was tracked by radar and seen bypilots visually moving at high speed up and down the Atlantic coast. The CommandCenter was put on Zebra alert and Admiral Trane gave the order to force down theUFO. Mr. McDow discusses the threats, intimidation and confiscation of logbooksthat occurred after the event.\"...And the early warning system—I believe it came in from an Air Force base inGreenland or Nova Scotia at that time—said that we had contact with anunidentified flying object that had entered our airspace....And within minutes Admiral Trane was rushed into the Command Center into hisviewing booth that he had right under the Mezzanine there and the first thingthat Admiral Trane wanted to know was how many contacts we had, where they were,which direction were they going and were the Soviets responding. Because we knewthat it wasn't the Soviets that had entered our airspace. That was verified fromthe get go, from the start.At that point, when Admiral Trane found out that it wasn't the Soviets and thathe wanted to know were the Soviets responding to this threat also, that was themoment that he gave authorization to put two planes up to go see what this thingwas. And that was when the chasing up and down the eastern seaboard began. Welaunched planes from as far north as Greenland to NAS (Naval Air Station),Oceania. This object, we had it on radar—this event lasted almost an hour. Youcould hear the pilots live voice transmissions being piped into the CommandCenter. And they had visual confirmation of the object and made descriptions ofthe object. Pilots were able to close a couple of times and were able to seethat the object was not an aircraft that we were familiar with-it was nothingthat we had and nothing that the Soviets had. That was determined very quickly.This vehicle or whatever it was that they were chasing showed very erraticflight up and down the coast, quick flight...One minute it was here and the next minute bam, it was down several hundredmiles down the coast, just playing tag...The photographs that we did get back in the Command Center later on came fromthe first encounters that the planes had with it off of the northern NorthAmerican coast.206They did get close enough to get some photographs taken that were later broughtover to the Command Center...What was really bugging Admiral Trane, what was really driving him nuts, wasthis thing absolutely had complete control of the situation and could beanywhere that it wanted to be in a matter of seconds. One minute we were closingon it off the coast of Maine, and the next minute it is in Norfolk heading southtowards Florida. And it is all that we can do to get the early warning radar upand down the coast to watch for this thing as it just had it's day with us.Admiral Trane and his staff were quite concerned about it to say the least. Theywere quite concerned especially once they found out that it wasn't the Russiansand it wasn't us and he wasn't aware of anyone else who had the technology tobuild such a craft that could move about so easily and so quickly. I rememberdistinctly looking over the rail of the mezzanine and just watching completechaos break out because of their inability to keep an eye on this thing,whatever it was.The UFO was moving around so erratically and so quickly up and down the coast...They were trying to notify as many commands as they could up and down the coastto track this thing or get a plane up. Admiral Trane was scrambling andauthorizing planes just left and right, up and down the whole eastern seaboardto try and cut this thing off and to get some planes from the north and south toliterally track it and to force it down. It was clear that they wanted torecover it, to force it down, by whatever means possible.The order was given by Admiral Trane to try and get this object forced down outof the sky, if at all possible, by whatever means possible...When this event, as I refer to it, ended, the object that we had been chasing upand down the seaboard headed out over the Atlantic, over the Azores. I doremember them saying that it had pulled up at a 66 degree angle as it approachedthe Azores like this, and it just pulled up at a 66 degree angle, withoutslowing down or anything, and left the atmosphere and was gone into space. Itjust took off into space and was gone like that [snaps fingers]. I mean it justabsolutely left. You are talking about something that covered thousands of milesin a blink of an eye and it was just gone and it just left everyone sittingaround scratching their heads. \"Gee whiz, I wonder what that was.\"It was comical in a way to see how the vast military might of the United Stateswas put on its knees by something they had no idea what it was, where it camefrom, where it was going or anything. The only thing that they knew for sure wasthat it wasn't the Soviets and they were very adamant about finding that out...... If this object had been hostile and wanted to drop weapons or shoot missilesat us or whatever, it would have been very easy for them to do that. There wasno question about that.207We didn't have anything at that time that could hold a candle to whatever thiswas. And it just had its own free run of our airspace and could do anything itwanted as far as traveling. We did not pose any threat to it whatsoever. Thatwas painfully obvious; very much so. I do believe that Admiral Trane knew thattoo and was quite afraid. Just in a word I would say that that old boy was justplain scared...I would say that the facilities that actually had this UFO on radar— there werefive that I am sure of and that is from Greenland all the way to Florida, andthere may be some others that I don't know. I know this because Admiral Tranewas giving orders to NAS Oceania, \"Let's get some planes up from there, scramblesome fighters.\" He did make a call for them to alert Dover Air Force Base,Patuxent River, Maryland, Cecil Field down in Florida...\"Admiral Lord Hill-Norton:Five-Star Admiral, Former Head of the British Ministry of DefenseLord Hill-Norton is a five-star Admiral and the former Head of the BritishMinistry of Defense who was kept in the dark about the UFO subject during hisofficial capacities. In this short interview, he states that this subject hasgreat significance and should no longer be denied and kept secret. Heemphatically states, \"...that there is a serious possibility that we are beingvisited—and have been visited for many years—by people from outer space, fromother civilizations; that it behooves us to find out who they are, where theycome from, and what they want. This should be the subject of rigorous scientificinvestigation, and not the subject of rubbishing by tabloid newspapers.\"Sergeant Clifford Stone: United States ArmySergeant Stone tells an amazing story about the history of UFOs andextraterrestrials dating back to the early 40's and probably before. GeneralDouglas MacArthur organized a group called the Interplanetary Phenomena ResearchUnit back in 1943 to study this issue and it continues to this day. Theirpurpose is to recover objects of unknown origin particularly those that are ofnon-Earthly origin. They obtain field intelligence information and pass it on tothose who are the \"keepers of this information.\" Stone says that even ProjectBluebook had an elite investigation unit, which was outside of Bluebook. Thisunit was thought to be working in conjunction with Bluebook but in fact was not.Stone has seen living and dead extraterrestrials in his official duties on anarmy team that retrieved crashed ET crafts. He thinks that the extraterrestrialswill not permit us to explore the depths of outer space until we've learned togrow spiritually and that they will make themselves known soon if we don't firstacknowledge their presence.208Mr. Don Phillips:Lockheed Skunkworks, USAF, and CIA ContractorDon Phillips was in the Air Force at Las Vegas Air Force Base during an eventwhen UFOs were seen moving at enormous speeds near Mt. Charleston, northwest ofLas Vegas. In addition, he worked with Kelly Johnson at the LockheedSkunkworks—on design and construction of the U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird. Hetestifies that we not only have these extraterrestrial devices, but have alsoachieved tremendous technological advances from their study. He states that inthe 1950s and 1960s, NATO did research into the origin of ET races, anddisseminated reports to the leaders of various countries. Mr. Phillips furtherstates that there are records and filmed documentation of meetings in Californiain 1954 between ETs and leaders of the USA. He lists a few of the technologieswe were able to develop because of the ETs: computer chips, lasers, nightvision, bulletproof vests, and concludes, “Are these ET people hostile? Well, ifthey were hostile, with their weaponry they could have destroyed us a long timeago—or could have done some damage.\" Mr. Phillips now develops technologies thatcan help eliminate environmental pollutants and reduce the need for fossilfuels, such as energy generation systems that use natural energies from planetEarth.Technology/ScienceMr. Fred Threlfell: Royal Canadian Air ForceMr. Threllfell was a communications instructor in the Royal Canadian Air Forceat RCAF Station Toronto in 1953, when he witnessed an experiment involving thesuccessful dematerialization and rematerialization of an object. Because of histop clearance, he was also able to check out from the base library, originalfilms of gun camera footage from WWII planes. Many times, while watching thesefilms, he noticed UFOs in the footage—different positions, different shapes,but, definitely UFOs. He has also himself seen UFOs maneuvering in the sky.209"},{"pageContent":"30 MONSTER OF UNCHECKED POWERThere is a relatively small group of people actually running the secret UFOprograms. In terms of full knowledge and operational authority - executiveauthority - it has nothing to do with the President of the United States or theCongress.In fact, I was told directly by an executive with E-Systems that E- Systems washeavily involved in these areas. He said, \"But very few people who work with thecorporation know it.\"The monies that such corporations receive are passed through several shelloperations and from various agencies and end up in these super- secret blackprojects.There is an interlocking power structure of corporate, institutional, financialand religious entities. They do not operate according to anything resembling therule of law or the Constitution of the United States, or any other country.Within that shadowy world, there are rogue elements that have broken off of themain covert operation. There are some very powerful rogue elements in thiscountry and elsewhere and within certain secret groups. They have shadowy tiesto the main group but can act independently and at times counter to the maingroup's agenda. So, it is very complex it is like layers of an onion. You thinkyou've gotten to the center, only to find there are 20 more layers to peel back.I've been peeling back these layers for about 15 years now and have a very goodidea of who these people are and how it's structured and what the agenda is.There are people in the central control group that have connections togovernment but who really don't know what the hell is going on inside FEMA orthe Mormon corporate empire or bizarre, shadowy plans related to theireschatological solution to the human problem.In the mid-1990s, I was invited to a 'salon' in San Francisco, in PacificHeights. A socialite who is friends with Gordon Getty, Willy Brown and StevenBechtel (of the Bechtel corporation) wanted me to brief her circle of friends onthese issues. (By the way, Bechtel Corporation, is a big shadow governmentcontractor, and George Schultz is associated with them. They are all part ofthis secret government apparatus…210There is a very powerful cell involving a former Secretary of State, USPresident and former Secretary of Defense most now involved in global financialenterprises.)The chairman of AT&T was there, and the former head of SRI, Stanford ResearchInstitute, was present. I was there to present to them what we knew and todiscuss our plans for the future. Sitting next to me was the former chairman ofSRI. At one point he leaned into me and said, \"You know, I never knew any ofthis, but I knew some of it had to be going on at SRI. What do you know about....\"such and such. He explained that, like the CIA Director I briefed, he was anadministrator, but did not have a need to know, and was left in the dark aboutsuch projects!He said, \"I was basically a bureaucrat, a bag man, trying to keep the moneyflowing into this huge operation. But if DARPA (Defense Advanced ResearchProjects Administration) had a project going on, I really didn't know anydetails! I might hear a whisper here and there, but these projects were tightlycontrolled, and it didn't matter that I was the chairman of SRI. And the way Igot there was to know you don't ask too many questions! So now I want to askyou!\"During the Iran Contra hearings, Senator Inouye stated that there is a shadowygroup that has its own air force, its own navy, its own funding mechanism, andis above the law. This is especially true in the areas of advanced coverttechnologies, UFO and extraterrestrial matters, and related weapons systems.One of the most dangerous trends that has evolved between the 1960s and today isthat this Shadow Government became so powerful because it was able to beself-funded. Now, let me explain. Dick D'Amato of the Senate AppropriationsCommittee was right when he said that there's upwards of $100 billion in theblack, illegal budget. But the big action is in the corporate, private financialworld. Let's say that you're Bell Labs at Murray Hill. I'm working with awitness who spent his entire career at Bell Labs. He was part of a cell that dida lot of super-secret covert contracting with military operations that hadextraterrestrial communications devices and circuits. These corporate labsstudied the technologies and uncovered how they worked and their possible uses.They came out with Widget A or X that then became something they patented, whichin turn multi-became a multi-hundred-billion-dollar industry. Think fiberoptics, integrated circuits, lasers and the like.This cancer of covert government funding metastasized into countless corporate,financial and technological assets. And now the covert private corporate worldhas technologies that can trump anything at DIA, CIA or any of the otheralphabet soup of government agencies.211Another corporate witness whom I have interviewed said that while at Bell Labs,he saw 28 or 29 of these free energy devices that they had acquired and'black-shelved' or hidden. This witness had worked on these technologies. He'sretired now.General Motors and other large corporations are also sitting on earth-savingtechnologies but will not let them out to the public.So these interlocking, multi-national corporate and financial interests are amulti-trillion-dollar operation that trumps any power of the Pentagon or theUnited States government or any nation on Earth. It is a monster of unchecked,corrupt corporate and covert power that is only partially governmental. So,unfortunately, even if you have a powerful person in what people call \"thegovernment\" who may want the truth out, he feels overwhelmed by these other'special interests'.I spoke to a member of Congress in February of 2004 who was on the CongressionalEnergy Committee. When he was at a meeting with Cheney, he said, \"Cheney ran themeeting and thinks exactly like an oil executive—he views everything as an oilexecutive, and that's it.\" What you have is the corporatization of thegovernment - of all governments of the world - into a certain agenda.One of the men that I've worked with for years is a covert corporate operativeinvolved in these types of operations. When I asked him to come forward, hesaid, \"There is no agency or government on Earth that can protect me from thewrath of this group, because it's outside these governments, and much morepowerful.\"Now, when you have something this large and complex, you have people involvedwith both joint interests and separate interests. And the more separate theinterests become, the more likelihood there is of a break-away rogue group. Themost violent rogue operations are the ones that are connected to ideology, asopposed to just money, and are rooted in a certain ideological andeschatological world-view.These are the people who have a worldview of destruction and feel that the onlyway for Christ to come back is for the world to be destroyed and for billions ofpeople to be killed. There is a very powerful group that holds to that beliefsystem. But they really are looking in their rearview mirror. What they areawaiting has already come to pass. They don't know what cycle we are in already,never mind what century we're in.So, they're completely off the timeline of the evolution of the human race butdon't know it. They are driving the world in a certain direction, to fulfilltheir interpretation of a prophecy, which has already happened. Alas, it may bea self-fulfilling prophecy of Armageddon - one that they create throughignorance, superstition and hatred. So, ultimately, the problem is ignorance,and the solution is enlightenment, knowledge and genuine spirituality.212The problem seems complex, but it can be very simply fixed. Where there isdarkness, you introduce light. So, what we need to do is shed light on thisissue and some perspective that allows people to understand that they do notneed to engage in global supremacy or global destruction, in order to have theirdreams come true.I remind people of the fact that no less a figure than Reagan's InteriorSecretary, James Watt, after a meeting during the Reagan years, said somethingto the effect of, \"All these environmentalists, they don't need to really worryabout the environment, because the end of the world is coming soon and Christ isreturning, and the world's going to be destroyed anyway! God wants us goodChristians just to go ahead and use it up while we still have time.\" I amparaphrasing, but this is essentially what the man who was in charge of policyfor the entire interior of America said!People need to understand that these types of superstitious and retrogradebelief systems actually drive decisions and policies. It's a tragedy. Now, it'snot talked about. Watt's comment was a slip of tongue that he didn't know wasbeing recorded or heard. But I have met with many people at that level ofinfluence, and they really hold to that belief. At this point in time, the USgovernment is fully infiltrated and run by people with this end-of-the-worldbelief system.Think about it: If that is your belief, you don't really care if there's globalwarming or an $8 trillion debt, because if, indeed, these are the end days, andthe world's going to come to an end and all life on Earth is going to end andthe good Christians are going to float up into the sky to Jesus, who cares?This may sound bizarre to the average person. But an eschatological worldviewdrives much of the world's covert decision-making- especially since thestructure of that group is heavily dominated by covert Mormon, Vatican and otherextremist religious interests. I have met directly with such interests.Of course, there are others involved in the covert world who are only interestedin conventional greed, power, money, and control. And still others who areconcerned with homeostasis: Let's not rock the boat, even if the boat's gettingready to go over Niagara Falls! There are different agendas operating, but theones that have the most power are the ones that are the most bizarre: thoserooted in retrograde cult-like religiosity and superstition.George Santayana was so right when he said, \"Fanaticism consists of redoublingyour efforts when you've forgotten your goal.\"From a fanatical end-of-the-world perspective, it makes sense to add half atrillion dollars a year in debt to add to an $8 trillion debt to pass on to ourchildren. It makes sense to hold up, for decades, technologies that could savethe earth even though you know both polar ice caps are melting! And why notallow thousands of species of plants and animals to become extinct? The world isending anyway!213No one would stay on this course while also knowing the solution, unless theyhad clearly fixed in their mind this eschatological paradigm.Once I discovered this covert agenda of global destruction, everything fell intoplace. I began to meet with people who were Satanic cultists -- who wereinvolved in these rogue breakaway groups. They are addicted to destruction andlove torture, suffering and sadism. And it turns out they are the other side ofthe mask of those who pray for the end-of-the-world. It is a very strange groupof bedfellows. They think it's the literal end of the world, when in reality itis the end of one Divine Cycle and the opening of another!This singular misinterpretation of Scripture and prophecy has enormousconsequences.The solution, as I see it, is to put out a different perspective: Yes, we cantalk about the end of one cycle - it is the end of one world, the old world. Butit doesn't mean we have to sit back while we literally destroy the Earth.We may not necessarily be able to change them. But we can articulate anexplanation that makes sense and hope that some of them see the solution beforeit's too late.It doesn't make sense that we have fiber optics and integrated circuits andlaptop computers that have the power of what once would fill a whole house—butwe're still burning coal for over 50 percent of the electricity needs of themost advanced nation on Earth! Come on. To make sense of this, you have tounderstand what is in the hearts and minds of those people who have hijacked thehuman future.These projects escaped the control of Eisenhower and others once corporate greedkicked in, and those projects broke away. People with very secret religiousagendas then infiltrated agencies and corporations and now are calling theshots. I have been told that, because they identify and recruit their own, thatvery powerful, right-wing Mormon interests have been pulled into the seniorechelons of the CIA, FBI, military, and a huge number of universities,laboratories, and corporations.What most people don't realize is that we are already living in an undeclaredtheocracy. People just haven't been told they're living in a theocracy yet. Ithas happened very quietly- very covertly. What the Nazis, with their cult, theThules, couldn't achieve overtly, they decided to do covertly. It is thecontinuation of World War II.People don't want to know this, I know. It is disturbing and counter to the myththat we've been led to believe.Among the people who have been sucked into this religiosity and worldview, arethose who really could care less about that belief system or the existence of214Christ. Rather, they have a Satanic world view, where they just enjoydestruction and suffering. They are in the very midst of the religious ones- butthe religious ones do not know who is really leading the flock.We are closing one chapter of human history, and we're going to open another. Inthe closing of one and the opening of another, much chaos is possible.There are wonderful things happening on Earth and have been for 150 years.Wonderful new ideas, new institutions, new ways of living, the potential for newtechnology--there are many things that are extremely promising. On the one handwe have this carcass of an old world that is dying. It is going through thedeath throes. And yet, here is this new world that has already been born, and isgrowing and is going to continue for thousands of years. It isn't going to bethe end of the world: it is the end of an old world and the simultaneousestablishment of a new one. We are already in the early stages of the golden eraof the human race- one that is going to go on for 500,000 years.So, that's what's exciting and beautiful, and that's what has to be shared, evenas we become aware of these very crazy and ignorant other dramas that are playedout. We need to focus on the good and the positive that's coming, even thoughwe're aware of what some of these other things are that are going on around us,because you need to know the lay of the land.Spaceship Earth needs to be guided through this period and be firmly establishedas the civilization it's intended to be. There are extraterrestrialcivilizations standing ready to assist, and at a certain point things willchange very rapidly.This transformation isn't going to happen by itself. We humans are going to haveto guide it and facilitate it. But we're not going to be alone: The destiny ofthe human race and Earth has never been alone. It's never been withoutassistance, and it's never been in doubt. There's no doubt about what our futureand our destiny is going to be. The only question is how we're going toextricate ourselves from the current situation and establish our world firmly onthe path of peace and justice.This is the planet of free will. Our free will has to be applied in order forthis transformation to happen. This is the lesson we have to learn. And as soonas we all pull together and use our free will to make this happen, it willhappen.We are trained in our educational systems and our society to simply conform.But, you know what? If you're conforming to a system that is utterly insane,there's a problem. And the world that has crept around us has become veryinsane. Therefore, we need to see it for what it is, break from it, and manifestthe good future that is sitting there, ripe like fruit ready to fall from a treeinto our hands.The Earth and humanity are ready to blossom. And it is not just the springtimeof Earth. It is the springtime of the entire cosmos.215"},{"pageContent":"31 SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE - A MYTHI have always loved the exploration of consciousness and its manifestations.Once in Blanca Peak in Colorado, we were doing field work from our cars due to athunder storm in the area. As we were sitting there, I did a technique where Ientered unbounded Mind, and began to put enormous energy into the area by seeingtwo counter-rotating discs in my mind like a Merkaba. Suddenly, our car justhopped up in a moment of anti-gravity levitation. Other cars nearby did the samething. Fellow field workers asked, \"My God, what happened?!\" And I smiled andsaid, \"We were playing with what consciousness can really do...\"There is so much we can do. But the Earth is calling out for practical work: westill burn coal for most of our electricity, just like 100 years ago. Humanevolution has been hijacked 100 years by the forces of ignorance and greed. Sowe must work for the Earth now.I'm reminded of the story of the Buddha coming across a man who had spent 30years practicing to levitate across a stream. Near him was a footbridge. Thisman was very proud of his accomplishment and said, \"Look, oh Buddha, watch.\" Andhe floated across the stream to the other side. And the Buddha walked across thefootbridge across the stream and said, \"Yes, but you could have just walkedacross the bridge, instead of spending 30 years trying to levitate...\"It's not to say that some of these abilities aren't wonderful- they are. But onecould spend a great deal of time and effort on such abilities. Meanwhile, we aredestroying the Earth and our civilization is terminal. So when the most greattask is at hand, even important things have to be set aside.These abilities in consciousness can be developed just as soon as oneunderstands the nature of mind and the nature of matter and the fact that thereis no matter separate from its complete and perfect integration withconsciousness. Nothing exists separate from mind. All matter and energy issimply awake-ness modulating and phasing and resonating in a different way. 216This has been demonstrated through various tests that have been done by Dr. BobJahn at Princeton and others. It's all non-local: There is no barrier of timeand space. And once you understand that, literally anything can be accomplishedwith enough training and focus.One of the trips I took was to Italy, England and France. At the Vatican, PaolaHarris set up a meeting between me and Monsignor Balducci. He is a seniortheologian to the Pope. We went to his apartment overlooking St. Peter's for theinterview. He's a very patrician, dignified and very sweet man, a wonderfulperson and genuinely spiritual.I asked him, \"Do you think these extraterrestrials are a threat or hostile inany way?\" He said, \"Oh, not at all! Besides, lower than humanity, there cannotbe in this entire universe!\"Later he said, \"You know, God cannot be so foolish as to entrust all of hishopes for intelligent beings just on this planet.\"When we were out on his balcony overlooking St. Peter's and the Vatican, hesaid, \"You know, I could not be saying these things unless I had the approval ofPapa\"—meaning the Pope had instructed him to speak on the reality of ETcivilizations!He told me point blank that he had the blessing of the Pope to talk about thisand to acknowledge the fact that the UFOs are real and that theextraterrestrials are good beings. And there was nothing for us to be worriedabout. When I asked him about the issue of putting weapons in space to target ETspacecraft, he got very agitated and said this is an absolutely wrong thing todo.I met also with the Vatican astronomer, who said the same thing and acknowledgedthat the UFOs were real and the ETs were real. And yet we know that there arecells within the Vatican, within the Opus Dei group, that have a very dark viewof all this and have really taken the information away from the others at theVatican. Like in the US, everything is very labyrinthine and compartmented atthe Vatican; it is very secretive.There have been Popes and senior people at the Vatican that are in theconventional religious structure who don't know what's going on within theseblack cells within their own bureaucracy. It's the same motif over and overagain.This motif repeats, whether you go to a religious entity, a political entity, ascientific entity, an agency of the government, or the military. Remember thatmotif. If you understand the motif of a rogue, compartmented, secretiveoperation within an institution, and multiply that process like a fractal -- itjust propagates all over the world.While in Rome, I also met with one of the Knights of Malta -- it does exist -and a representative of the Jesuit Secret Service and the Vatican SecretService. These groups are intimately involved in global financial andtechnological issues related to this subject. They are some of the key people inthe hierarchy.217They asked that I provide them with the materials that I was providing theseother leaders in the \"white world,\" that is the regular, conventional world ofgovernments, senators, the President and what have you. And, of course, I did.But I told them, \"You know, there are traditions that have existed for manycenturies, of secrecy and secret power. But this is the time for thoseoperations to transform into another way of functioning--to openness andhonesty, in a way that will benefit all of humanity.\" They listened verypolitely, and I could tell they were intensely interested, and more than alittle shaken.The Knights of Malta and the Vatican Secret Service and the Jesuit SecretService have a very key role in maintaining the secrecy on the ET issue.When President Carter wanted information on UFOs, he went to then-CIA DirectorBush, George Bush, Sr. during the transition. He was told point blank, \"No, youcan't have that; go see if you can get it from the Congressional ResearchService.\" Here you have a sitting CIA director who was knowledgeable of thesematters- George Bush, Sr.--denying an incoming U.S. President information! Thisis true. And we have witnesses to this.So Carter asked people associated with the Congressional Research Service tofind out what was going on. They asked, in turn, a lawyer named Daniel Sheehan-- who was with the Christic Institute and was representing the Jesuits inWashington, to see if he could get this information from the Vatican. So,Sheehan contacted the Vatican on behalf of incoming President Carter.Well, the Vatican came back and said, \"No, we cannot give this to you.\" Theyspecifically did not say, \"We didn't have it,\" but said \"We would not give it toyou or the President.\" The covert Vatican library and files have extensiveinformation on all of these matters. Remember, back in 1994, a secret governmentinsider told me that, in terms of technology transfer and management, that Iwould be better off talking to certain groups of Jesuit priests than to the CIADirector or the U.S. President. He was completely correct.We have a naval witness who was on a mission to go out into the Atlantic andsearch for what they were calling magnetic anomalies. Now, in those circles,'magnetic anomalies' is a euphemism for underwater extraterrestrial vehicles.They used a specially equipped nuclear submarine to search for underwater UFOs.As they were setting up to go out on this secret mission, a limousine pulled up,and out came a suit (an unnamed covert intelligence operative) and a priest infull clerical collar. They were the last ones on the submarine and gave all theinstructions.The submarine went to an area where they encountered enormous underwaterextraterrestrial vehicles that were tracked at various times going 400 to 500knots!218These UFOs were zipping through the water at the speed of a jet but were notleaving any significant wake. Then suddenly, two of the UFOs came on either sideof the submarine and took the entire nuclear drive system offline. The nuclearsubmarine couldn't move forward, backward or in any direction. They were justsuspended there.All this time, they have sophisticated electronic equipment collecting data.When the submarine returned to port, all this data was put together and washanded to this priest, who was not American. He was from the Vatican. He tookall that data and left. It was a special operation directed by and for theVatican, using a US Navy nuclear submarine!Until this witness spoke to me, he could never figure out why a Catholic priestwas the major-domo— the guy in charge—of such an operation.We understand why. The myth of the separation of church and state is just that-a myth. Even people who understand that there's a shadow government can'tbelieve the extent to which certain covert, rogue religious interests haveinfiltrated the organization. That's how the control is maintained.The truth hides itself. In other words, if you can tell a version of the truththat is palatable, it can be accepted. But if you actually tell the truth, thewhole truth, and pull the whole veil back, it hides itself because it seems notcredible. But the strangest things really are true...So, in an ironic way, because the actual truth of these matters is so faroutside the matrix of conventional wisdom and belief, it's difficult to tell thewhole truth. This has been a struggle for me for about 12 years. After I gotinto that level of covert knowledge, I thought, \"Who the hell can I tell thisto?\"Wisdom requires that you share the truth that can be comprehended by the personlistening. What good does it do to teach calculus to someone in preschool who'sjust learning what two and two is?And yet at the same time, I'm very troubled with knowing this information andnot sharing it. So now I speak the truth, even if it discredits me.... We aregetting to the end of the algorithm. We knew when 9/11 happened— after theDisclosure Project had tens of thousands of people demanding open hearings, andthere were serious members of Congress looking into that possibility - that theagenda was being rolled out more quickly.And what was the next thing on the algorithm after global terrorism? A hoaxedthreat from outer space.The final card the covert meta-government will play would be a hoaxed threatfrom outer space related to extraterrestrial intelligence. So, we are very closeto the end of the algorithm. Time does not allow the luxury of staying quietabout the truth - even the Forbidden Truth.219"},{"pageContent":"32 BEHIND THE SCENESAfter 9/11, many mainstream people began to question what is really going onbehind the scenes. A certain sinister manipulation is evident to many people. Idon't have the luxury of putting all that information aside and thinking it's aconspiracy theory. I know it to be true. The only question I've ever had is:When do I put all these elements together and try to explain it so it makessense to people? And sound the alarm: Wake up, and don't be deceived. Peoplemust not be stampeded into a fear of ETs and thus begin to openly support StarWars against ET civilizations. These covert special interests want to unite andcontrol the world through fear, rather than uniting the world through peace andhope. It is the antithesis of where we should be at this time in our evolution.Such efforts, therefore, are the antithesis of what would sustain life and agood future on Earth.Most people can understand that there are secret projects. A smaller number ofpeople comprehend that there are ultra-secret, black projects. Everyone in thegovernment knows it. And then there are a certain number of people who can gettheir mind around the fact that some of them could be related to projects thathave broken away and are rogue and illegal- that are centered in the corporateand military-industrial- laboratory complex that deal with advanced energysystems and UFOs.But you then get into a smaller sub-set who understand that some of these roguegroups have fully operational devices that look like UFOs; have createdartificial life forms that look like extraterrestrials; have been going aroundsimulating contact events called \"abductions;\" have engaged in the mutilation ofcattle for the fear factor that they can put out to the public and thesub-culture of UFOlogy the pop media, the science fiction buffs, and others-because that's how they seed the consciousness with fear. And then there's evena smaller number who understand that the strings being pulled behind the scenesare from a trans-national, fascist-oriented group, not unlike the Thules thatwere behind the emergence of Hitler. What they couldn't do overtly during theThird Reich, they have done covertly.220And through Operation Paperclip we brought them into the United States andseeded the aerospace industry and the CIA.So, the global socialist fascist effort that did not take hold overtly in WorldWar II has been going on, at a subterranean level, since then. We are about tosee its unveiling in a larger way, as attempts to consolidate power in the worldaround such a philosophy and around such a structure become consummated.Meanwhile, they speak of democracy -but mean a pseudo-democracy of a centrallycontrolled society run covertly by an unidentified and unacknowledged powerstructure.Now, if you find this disturbing, you should. And the only antidote to this thatI can see is knowledge and truth and letting enough people know what's going onso that they won't be deceived. Because those running this covert agenda arecounting on our collective ignorance. What they are banking on is a matrix ofmis-education, dis-education and disinformation that has kept everyone consumercows of belief systems and materialism. False belief systems, mixed with variousmaterial addictions, creates the poison of choice for the masses.But by sharing from heart to heart, we can tell people the truth and explainanother vision of the good future that awaits Earth and her children. We live inthe time of these extremes: very dark and very bright. We live in the time oftransformative change.Most of the people who are at the Pentagon, in the White House, and in the CIAknow nothing about these ultra-secret agendas. They are cogs in a machine, andare also victims of ignorance. Most are good people caught in a machine not oftheir making - and about which they have very little knowledge. It is our job toshare this knowledge with everyone, including those in the government andmilitary. For 12 years we have been moving this information into those circles,and many are realizing that they have been deceived. They then supportDisclosure.Just before 9/11, I was giving a lecture in Oregon. After the talk, a man cameup to me who had been in the military for his whole career. He was there with afriend and they were acting very cautiously.When most everyone had left, one of our Disclosure Project volunteers, JordanPease, said these men wanted a moment alone with me. One man, I'll call himR.J., had been involved in the military from an early age, and in the '60s hadbeen pulled into these covert projects. One such project dealt with his abilityto set up spy technologies from space that were so advanced that you could hearpeople talking from space and see everything they were doing. And this was inthe '60s!The technologies that are out there are far beyond anything ever reported in thenews. This is why I laugh when they say, \"Oh, we can't find Osama bin Laden.\"Right. That and other fairy tales. Please. I mean, how stupid do they think weare? But -- more on that later. 221R.J. proceeded to tell me, because of his skills, he was pulled deeper anddeeper into these projects and eventually was pulled into the projects dealingwith UFOs. He said, \"You know, I'm afraid you don't understand what these thingsare that you think are ETs.\" And I said, \"Oh, you're referring to the man-madeones that are programmed life forms?\" And he pushed back from the table; heasked, \"How do you know about that?\"\"Oh, I have around a dozen witnesses who've worked on these pseudo-ETcreatures.\" I said, \"But if I talk too much about it, people will think I'vejust absolutely lost my marbles.\" He said, \"Let me tell you what I worked on.\"So, he proceeded to tell me about the projects he had participated in, both inthe United States and Australia.\"We did have extraterrestrial materials that were being worked on and wedeveloped very advanced technologies that were a type of anti-gravity craft. Isaw trans-dimensional capabilities, things that involve the ability to goforward or backward in time— all kinds of things.\" He explained.(We have another witness who was with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas who knewabout Project Red Light and Operation Looking Glass that involve thosecapabilities.)Then R.J. said, \"You know, what most people don't realize is that I was involvedin putting together the projects that were doing a lot of these things thatpeople call abductions!\"\"We were hoaxing a lot of these abduction events that people think areextraterrestrial contact. Well, this one place where I worked -- it wasunderground -- there were all these containers. And there were these creaturesthat we were growing in a culture medium that were at different stages ofdevelopment. And these creatures looked like what people think areextraterrestrials.\"R.J. proceeded to tell me that there were several generations of theseartificial life forms. They were trying to perfect their man-made ETs; they hadbeen doing these Nazi-like genetic experiments from the '40s,'50s, until he was out of those projects. These pseudo-ETs were all lined up,almost like an archive. He said the state-of-the-art ones were really quite goodand believable.\"Of course, we had these creatures that were like automatons, being commanded byhumans, on these things that people think are extraterrestrial ships.\" R.J.didn't know that I already knew that these hoaxes were going on and were verysophisticated. He thought that I had been deceived, like most UFO researchers.\"No, I've known about this for a very long time.\" I said. \"Well, why don't youtalk about it?\" He asked.222\"Because,\" I explained, I'm trying to get people to even acknowledge the factthat there's such a thing as a UFO.\"\"Yes, I understand your position;\"He said, \"I'm very glad you know about this. But do you know something else?Much of this has been placed in facilities all over the world, in the jungle inthe Amazon, in Australia, and other remote places. Eventually, I got assigned,to a deeper and deeper level, and before I was going to be deployed to thisplace in Australia, they took me into another level of my educational program.\"He said, \"You don't really know what's going on.\"He explained that he witnessed a Satanic ritual initiation. Those present sharedblood and there were sacrifices going on and torture. He was being acculturatedto the programs of Satanic worship and Satanic sacrifice and the love of thebloodthirsty killing of innocents. He told us that once he got to that level, hehad to take a vow to Lucifer. And he did.This is not the first person who's told me about these programs. He wastransferred to Pine Gap, Australia, and said it was the most unusual experience.He was flown in at night in a helicopter, to this facility. And as theyapproached this hill, what looked like a normal piece of land opened up. It waslike it was a hologram and as they approached, the side of this hill opened andthey flew right into the earth. They went deep inside, to where there wereenormous, man-made UFOs. There were big triangular ones there, as well. He said,\"We have facilities like these all over the world.\"As he shared this with me, he would stop periodically and say, \"I know you'regoing to think I'm making this up, and I know you can't believe this.\" At theend of his account, I said, \"I want you to know that I have multiple witnesseslike yourself -- who you don't know, because you were in your own compartmentedproject -- who have told me virtually the same story about different places atdifferent times. And so I have no doubt in my mind that this has been going on.\"He took a deep breath, then let it go; a huge sigh of relief.One of the most sophisticated facilities of this type is in England. A lot ofthese so-called \"reptilian\"-looking creatures that people think areextraterrestrial are programmed life forms and bio-machines, and are beingcreated there frankly. But it's important for them to understand the kind ofmindset we're dealing with. One of the gentlemen I'm working with, from a verywell-connected family of centi-millionaires who are very involved in diplomaticand intelligence operations, had gone through the programming at a certainmeditation institute. He got to Level 14 of the training. He said that unlessthey could do a profile on you and see that you were to the 'right of GenghisKhan', in terms of wanting to be223aggressively violent and destructive, you couldn't get past that level. Since hewasn't wired to be extremely violent and hate-filled, they ended theirinvolvement with him.He said they talked a lot about Dr. Greer and the Disclosure Project, and theywere really glad that I was getting information out that the UFOs and ETs werereal. But they were furious to the point of deep hatred that I was exposing thefalse phenomenon and their false agenda. They are committed to this final battleof inter-planetary war, which is the chief agenda of the hard-core secrecy. Theywere livid that I would not go along with that agenda, and that I had discoveredthe plan for hoaxing an ET attack on earth- and was exposing it to people at thePentagon and elsewhere. He said they wanted me dead. They do not want anyone ofsubstance saying that the real extraterrestrial presence is not only verybenign, but also extremely helpful and quite enlightened.\"Do you realize how much you are hated?\" he asked. \"Yes\", I answered, \"But thatand their threats will never keep us from speaking the truth.\"As The Disclosure Project picked up steam, I had been warned that if it wentbeyond what they could control through the mainstream big media, things wouldhappen to shut it down. I was told this explicitly.On 9/11, I was in Seattle, having just returned from Simon Frazier University inVancouver for a lecture the night before. When I woke up on 9/11, I turned onthe television and thought what I was seeing was a movie. After I realized thiswas real and not a movie, I called Emily, my wife, to see that everyone wasokay. My next call was to my daughter in Washington, because I wanted her to getout of the city.I couldn't get through to Washington, because all the phones were completelyjammed. So, the next call was to my military adviser. The first words out of hismouth were, \"Well, the conventional operations that people think are responsiblefor the security of the United States have no state-of-the-art equipment,inadequate personnel, and the people who can monitor these events in real timeare a rogue black element, and never the twain shall meet.\"I was 3,000 miles from home. This was a very emotional and difficult time, notbeing with my family during all this chaos. But that night, I was scheduled fora lecture to the medical society of the area. I called one of the organizers andsaid, \"What do we do? Do we cancel? This is a national emergency.\" And theysaid, \"People are calling us saying they still want to hear what you're going tosay.\"I was hardly in the mood to give a lecture, to say the least, but I did. It wasstanding room only— the best attended medical society meeting in memory.I presented what we were doing, and put it into the framework of a manipulatedagenda to move us from super-power conflict, to global terrorism, and eventuallyinto a threat from outer space.224There were elements— not in the conventional military, not in the conventionalintelligence services, not in the conventional quarters of power— but withinrogue elements, that were manipulating these conditions. We had come to thispoint in history as no surprise to those of us who know this group and what theagenda and mindset is.You could have heard a pin drop.It was one of the first times I've ever said this in a gathering like this—thesewere all fellow physicians. This was not a new age UFO conference! But I said,\"You have to understand, it's all about power—massive geo-political power.\"People running these programs have a 'Masters of the Universe' complex, a Godcomplex. It is megalomania on steroids. And honestly, that is the mindset youhave to get your own consciousness around, to comprehend what motivates thisbehavior.I said, \"Is it really that hard to figure out? Having lived personally in Israelfor three years and almost having been killed twice by terrorist bombings, noneof this is a surprise to me. For ten years, we have been in the Middle Eastafter the first Gulf War, increasingly being resented by Osama bin Laden, andother fanatics. But he was an ally of ours in Afghanistan, in the fight againstthe USSR. But natives of the Middle East were furious that we were in their HolyLand of Saudi Arabia.\" And I asked, \"Why are we there? We like the scenery? Theculture? Or we like visiting Mecca? We like the 120-degree temperatures? We'rethere for one word: oil. We're still there for oil, and we're still using oil,because these other technologies have been kept secret. I will never defendterrorists; however, we have to understand why, all of a sudden, we're this bigtarget. Well, it's not all of a sudden. This has been coming for a long time.And there are people who knew damned good and well been talking about thechickens coming home to roost for a long time. Frankly, as the Chinese sayinggoes, ' Unless we change direction, we're likely to end up where we're going.'But no one's looking at where we're going. It's high time that we wake up andsee where we're headed.\"I said, \"You know, now we're going to have to do some tactical things to containthis problem, because the conventional military and intelligence services aregoing to be scrambling around, trying to respond to this in a reactive way. Butno one's looking at what the causative dynamic is behind it.\"After 9/11, all the airports were closed, but I had a lecture tour alreadyplanned for the Pacific Northwest. So we decided to continue the Disclosuretour, in spite of the horror of 9/11.The very last event that I did was in Washington state, in a rural area, with agroup supported by Linda Evans, the actress. We had dinner together and a longtalk about all these issues. Linda Evans is very supportive of what we're doing.225On the day that I was regularly scheduled to fly home, it turned out to be thefirst day of normal flights scheduled out of SEATAC! I never had to even changea ticket. I never had to miss a flight. It was as if we didn't skip a beatbecause of 9/ 11. And there's a deeper message in that: even as global chaos isoccurring, we are able to speak the truth, reach thousands of people, and stayon our path in the midst of these extraordinary times.If you're doing the right thing and you're speaking the truth, even the greatestbarriers will part and move out of your way. You have to walk the mystical pathwith practical feet.You know, Michael Moore said the only conspiracies he believes in are the onesthat are true.There is an almost Pavlovian response that's been programmed into the\"mainstream\" media and elites. If you use certain words -- \"conspiracy\" -- itimmediately is associated with \"kook.\"And if you use the word \"UFO,\" it immediately brings in \"abduction\" and \"kook.\"So, there are certain automatic responses that have been programmed into ourculture, especially by big media. A careful analysis of how the rogue nationalsecurity state and psychological warfare people operate shows that they haveprogrammed this response and reaction when those issues come up. This strategyhas been very carefully cultured over many decades.We have the responsibility of doing this in a credible way that makes sense, butone of the serious problems to doing this is: The closer you get to what thehidden truth is, the less believable it is, and you risk your credibility.So, it's a Catch 22.I have been asked a number of times what has been the most disappointing thingover the last 15 years. By far it's been the fact that there are people withwhom I had spent significant time with, and who have accepted this informationas true, and who have enormously powerful positions where they could do a greatdeal of good -- whether it's a senator or a President or a U.N. official or ageneral in the military or a senior scientist -- and basically when it gets tothe point of following up the information with any productive, constructiveaction, they run with their tail between their legs and say, \"I can't do this.\"Henry Kissinger once said, \"This is the hottest potato in the universe. I'm notgoing to deal too much more with it.\" So, he knew about it, but many of thesepeople want to just take a pass on it. It's the ultimate buck to pass. Well, whoare you going to pass it to, particularly if the President of the United Stateshas taken a pass on it?There are agendas within agendas within agendas within agendas. The question is:How do we get enough of the information out to enough of those with power, andto the public, to provide knowledge and shine a light into these dark corners?And we have to also clearly describe an alternative.226After 9/11, I immediately made the decision that we must quickly identify andget out to the public these new, earth saving technologies, while continuingDisclosure. We had to do something to create enough support and potentialfunding to be a countervailing force to this machine that's been going on forover 50 years. It was time for us to go from military witnesses and documents tothe actual technologies. When 9/11 happened, we knew we were getting very latein the game.In the fall of 2001, we formed Space Energy Access Systems, Inc (SEAS). A groupof people put in a few hundred thousand dollars together so we could investigatewhat was available in the non-covert world. We have found some technologies atproof-of-principle stage, but none so far that are ready for release to thepublic as a free energy system. Those devices that are more advanced - and wehave seen some - are held by scientists who have been extremely intimidated orbrainwashed into secrecy.For example, Dr. Loder and an engineer on our team went to visit one of thesescientists who had been intercepted by a physicist who has been indoctrinatinghim with eschatological belief systems. This spook, who is masquerading as ascientist told the inventor, \"Don't let any of your technology out until oursociety collapses. And then, Phoenix-like, you can be the science savior, andbring the technology out when everything has fallen apart.\"So, basically, this man has been brainwashed with an eschatological timeline andis withholding the technology, pending these cataclysmic events. Of course, thisis a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we don't have something to stave off thedepletion of the oil reserves and the destruction of the biosphere, theseterrible events will happen. So, it's circular thinking. But you can't really doanything once someone has been brain- washed with this belief system.We have also identified an anti-gravity system that is in the early stages ofdevelopment. With sufficient funding, it could be brought to maturity as a freeenergy and anti-gravity system. The world desperately needs these earth-savingtechnologies.227"},{"pageContent":"33 A NEW WORLD - IF YOU CAN TAKE ITNow it is an order of magnitude to go from people with top-secret clearances,testimony and documents to an actual machine, because it is a material science.But we must convince some of the scientists who have the knowledge of these newenergy technologies that a window is open, and if we are not going to walkthrough it now, what are we waiting for? We cannot force this on anyone. It is avoluntary association. And so all we can do is explain: Here are the securitysystems we have in place. And here is why now is the time to bring thesewondrous new sciences into practical application.Right now, in addition to behind-the-scenes tactical security we have what Icall \"strategic security\"We have some very powerful people within this covert group who support what weare doing, and who will respond in kind to any threat against us.And we have millions of people who know what you are doing. Remember what theNational Security lawyer told me in 1990 when I was considering forming CSETI.He said \"Don't walk, but run, and get this information out in front a lot ofpeople.\"And that is why I agreed to go on \"Larry King Live\", and why I agreed to go on alot shows like \"48 Hours\", because whether the publicity is good or bad, havingmillions of people watching what we're doing provides enormous security.Such exposure puts a billion-watt spotlight on you and everyone you're workingwith. And here's the good news about that: Secret power thrives in the darknessof secrecy.If they step into the fray when there is a big spotlight shining on our efforts,they are going to have a lot people see their ugly actions happen in real-time.All that we do, all that we find, all our evidence and so forth are duplicatedand put into the hands of certain key prime movers who will get that informationout to the public -- on the radio, on the internet, on the television- ifanything were to happen to us.228If you do that with the plans for a new technology, it will not disappear, butrather be massively disclosed. And then killing us will not matter. This is acounterintuitive strategy that many scientists have a hard time understanding:Secrecy is impossible to maintain against the group we're dealing with. Theyhave electronic systems that interface with consciousness. Forget the old NSAhooks in space. That was '60s technology.They can monitor everything going on in real-time. And there is no way for us tokeep what we're doing secret from that element. So we don't waste any time oreffort or thought doing it. It is delusional to think you are going to doanything off the radar of this powerful covert machine.Then what is your choice? Your choice is to do a type of Aikido. You take thatenergy and you flip it around to the opposite and you act in complete opennessand transparency. So instead of being obscure and secretive and furtive, you doit in plain sight, and you get it out to the masses in real-time as quickly asyou can.That is why as soon as Dr. Loder, and a member of our board for SEAS, and I cameback from an offshore location where we found an energy device in 2003, we wentpublic and talked about it with millions of people listening.The more that people know, the less likely it is these rogue interests can act,because there is a big spotlight on the effort. They're vampires, like Dracula.They don't want to step into the sun. When the sun comes up, they go runninglike cockroaches. You flip the light on and the cockroaches all go back into thecrevices.They do not want to be caught in a covert, murderous, disruptive action againsta group with high profile. I have spoken to some people in the mainstream media,who have said: It would be very difficult for us to get the information outsimply as a story about UFOs, but if you or anyone else gets a threat, and youcan prove it, or anything happens to you, that is going to be a big story,because then it is going to be a scandal. And there will be millions of peoplewondering what the hell happened to you and your people.We also have tapes, that are already duplicated and in the hands of people forsudden release, that disclose the key facilities and many names related to thiscovert group.But, many of these scientists live in fear and trauma, a type of \"new energypost traumatic stress syndrome.\"These scientists have been convinced through psychological warfare modalities,to be very paranoid and overly secretive - but that only works against them.They will never win the secrecy game. But we can succeed at Disclosure!Because in speed and in openness, there is safety —-contrary to what peoplethink.229There is no way you're going to do it secretively. Your worst enemies are goingto know everything you're doing in real-time; and the people who could be theresupporting you, the masses who are concerned about the environment and oil,won't know what you're doing. This is the mistake that has been made for 100years.People want a solution to the environmental, oil and poverty issues of thisplanet. There is enormous support for any technology that helps resolve thoseproblems.Once mass support is in place, you would have people rioting and burning downWashington before you could let the patent office issue a Section 181 to seizethe technology!When Ted Koppel invited me on \"Nightline\" if we finally identify a legitimatefree energy device, I said, \"I'll come on your show and tear any secrecy orderup in front of millions of people if you'll let me.\"He looked at me -- this is face-to-face with Ted Koppel and said \"I will.\" Noamount of money and no threat is going to stop us from doing what is right.We cannot have the good future that awaits humanity without technologies thattake us off fossil fuels and nuclear power. Therefore it is worth doing what weneed to do to secure these technologies for peaceful applications and not allowthem to be weaponized.This is a completely achievable objective.The secrecy and ruthless suppression of these technologies is related to power.If you are doing something where you are impacting a five- or six-trilliondollar part of the world economy, and it is the core operating paradigm of theworld economy, it is a significant issue.Many people don't know that one of the key areas of concern at the NationalSecurity Council of the United States is economic national security. One of thewitnesses that I am working with worked under an admiral who was in charge ofthe Office of Naval Research. This Admiral at a meeting said, point blank, \"Mychief job is maintaining the status quo of the world's energy supplies andgrid.\"Because imagine this: We come out with these technologies, and the billionpeople in Latin America or sub-Sahara Africa, or the 1.1 billion people in Indiaor the billion and one-half or two billion in Asia would have the ability tohave a device in every village that would generate all the energy they wouldneed for clean water, electrification, refrigeration, transportation, lightmanufacturing - without pollution, and without any cost for the energy itself.The device would be no more expensive to produce than a generator.You would have an enormous uplifting of the masses of the world's populationthat are now living in mind-boggling poverty.230We forget that there's only about 20 percent of the world's population that isliving with anything resembling modern conveniences and modern technology. Theother 80 percent are barely half a step out of the jungle, if that.So in that setting, we have a world of increasing crises, increasing anger atthe West, increasing likelihood of war and terrorism. But when thesetechnologies come out, this is the tide that will lift all ships. It is reallygood news - unless you own a trillion-dollar oilfield.What happens when billions of people in India, Sub-Sahara Africa, Latin Americanand Asia begin to have a level of economic activity that surpasses that ofAmerica and Europe?Suddenly, you have the biggest geopolitical power shift in the history of theworld, where the 'great white father' is no longer the only one on theplantation making decisions. And the truth is, this speaks to the heart of thefascist fears within some of the control elements: Once free energy is availableto the world, these interests would have to actually share power with people whoare from other continents, other races, other cultures. Geopolitical powerdoesn't flow from the size of your population-it flows from your economic clout!If population alone determined world power, the most powerful countries in theworld would be India and China, and they are not. Power flows from yourtechnological and economic prowess, and resulting military power -- that andthat alone.The Soviet Union fell apart because its economic prowess was bankrupt. And nowthe lone superpower in the world is the United States.And yet, humanity could have manufacturing, with no pollution, recycling 100percent of all waste, energy for electrification and transportation withoutpollution—all with no cost for the energy itself. There would be no need for amulti-trillion dollar electric grid system that India and much of the worldlacks, and which they do not have the financial resources to create.These new free energy technologies would grow the world economy from a $30trillion per year economy to a hundred or two hundred trillion dollar economy.However, most of that growth would be outside of America and Europe, whichtogether only has 600 million people. The world has ten times that number: sixbillion.This would cause the biggest shift in geopolitical power in the history of thehuman race. And it would be fairly sudden: 10-20 years - at the most 50 years.This is one of the key reasons for the secrecy. Such secrecy is deeply rooted inpower issues, and unfortunately also has a rather ugly racist undertone to it.The old adage, \"If you want peace, work for justice\" is quite apt here. It isvery hard to have justice in the world when a very small number of people areusing up all the world's resources, while the vast majority live in mind-numbingpoverty.231In order to change that dynamic, these technologies must come out. Once they do,the world will grow for all its peoples.So this is the big question: Are we willing to create a world that's just andabundant for all of its citizens and really share power in the world? Are wewilling to put a seat at the geopolitical table for all peoples?So far the answer has been no to this good future. It is time we say yes. Growthwill be stunning and rapid in regions of the world long withheld from progress.It is similar to areas that have bypassed a hundred years of development oflinear phone lines, and gone directly to satellite phones and cell phones.On a much more fundamental and profound level, these regions of the world willskip over 150 years of smokestack industrial revolution, and go directly topoint-of-site power generation without transmission wires, and without the needfor fuels or expensive infrastructure.So they will quickly become industrialized, but without pollution. And with thatwill come enormous economic activity, technological developments andgeopolitical power.Such a change in how we generate energy will cause a decentralization of power,literally and figuratively. Power generation will be decentralized, but so willpower politics. Every village will begin to be self-sufficient, thus minimizingcentralized control. Once you understand these technologies, you understand thatthey will be able to generate the energy needs of the local area and alltransportation and manufacturing needs. And the more developed applications ofthese sciences allow for the manifestation of any material object needed in thelocal area.So it will be an enormous revolution in the material fortunes of the earth.We are coming out of an era where people have been clubbing each other over thehead over a scrap of land or a piece of gold -this is a whole new paradigm.But this new paradigm washes away the need for central, clandestine secretsocieties, centralized banking and excessive central control.We will be unified and integrated as a world civilization, but there will be aconcomitant increase in empowerment at the local level.On the one hand, we will become increasingly integrated as a global villagebecause of instant global communications and transportation. Travel from onecontinent to another will be extremely fast using these new anti-gravitypropulsion systems.And yet on the other hand, the level of self-sufficiency and empowerment will becentered primarily at the local, village, and neighborhood level.These twin paradoxical processes of increasing empowerment at the village orlocal level, and increasing integration of the global community will occursimultaneously. It's a new world completely. 232I'm reminded of the REM song: \"It's the end of the world as we know it, but Ifeel fine!\"As wonderful as this global transformation is for the masses of humanity, andfor the earth, it is a worst-case scenario for the very elite people who want tostay firmly in control of the world. Because when you decentralize powergeneration and economic activity, you also decentralize this top-heavykleptocracy currently running the planet.I am reminded of a story that Colonel Corso told a mutual friend about anexperience he had at Holloman Air Force Base in 1956.At that time, many extraterrestrial vehicles were zipping around over the baseand were being tracked on radar. Of course it was a very sensitive area, nearthe Trinity site, where we detonated the first atomic weapon.On this one particular day, an object was tracked on radar during daytime. ThisET craft descended and landed out on the Holloman range.Col. Corso jumped in a jeep by himself to go out to that area. When he arrived,he saw a seamless, silvery egg-shaped craft, hovering just above the ground,silently. It would become fully materialized, shining in the sun, and thendisappear -- and all he would see was a mirage- a heat wave- over the sand. TheET craft would dematerialize into this energy field in the shape of the craft,and then it would flash back and be materialized again.Suddenly, an extraterrestrial being appeared outside the craft with some sort ofa communication device, to communicate telepathically.Col. Corso asked, \"Who goes there friend or foe?\" And the ET said,\"Neither.\"The ET then proceeded to say, \"We would like for you to stop using some of theseradar systems that are interfering with our craft...\". (Remember that theRoswell crash had happened because there were high-powered radar system set upon a certain frequency that would disrupt ET craft propulsion and navigationsystems.)Col. Corso, being a rather brash military guy, said, \"Well, what's in it forme?\"The ET turned to him, and said, \"A new world, if you can take it!\" Now 50 yearslater, we must learn to take it — to accept the new world being offered to us.We need to learn to accept the new world that has been delayed for decades --and initiate what will be thousands of years of a sustainable, enlightenedcivilization.That is what the ET civilizations are waiting for us to do, and we are thegeneration that must achieve it.233"},{"pageContent":"34 SOLVING OUR OWN DYSFUNCTIONIt was once said to me by an oil man, that using oil for fuel is like burningyour Picasso in the fireplace for heat: Oil is too precious to use for energy.When we look at the needs of a civilization that will be here for hundreds ofthousands of years, we should save oil as something that can be held in reservefor essential purposes like synthetics, lubricants, plastics and the like. Usedwisely, the Earth has adequate resources for an advanced civilization forthousands and maybe millions of years. But used foolishly as we do today, Earthcannot sustain us.That makes sense to anyone who is logical. But if your decision-making is basedon insane fear and greed, or some kind of end-of-the-world eschatological beliefsystem, then you don't care about thousands of years from now. You don't evencare about 20 years from now.These technologies that have been withheld have caused us to liter- ally burnthrough resources that should have been held in reserve for more appropriateuses long-term by our children's children's children's children's children'schildren.My father was half Cherokee, and the Cherokee believed that everything we doshould be looking at many generations not yet born. But at this time in historywe are beginning a cycle that is half a million years in duration.So everything we are doing today should be looking at 20,000 generations not yetborn. A man that I worked with in the 1990s, who was on Ronald Reagan's NationalSecurity Council staff, said long-term planning for the National SecurityCouncil was six months! It was just reactionary -- going from crisis to crisis.It has been argued that these new energy and propulsion technologies can beweaponized, which is true. Anything can be weaponized: As an ER doctor, I haveseen people killed with beer bottles! But does that mean we shouldn't have thesetechnologies, and just let the world be cannibalized and destroyed out offoolishness?234Or instead, should we create international cooperative and collective security,so that we insure, guarantee, and enforce the safe use of such technologies?Under such a system, anyone or any group or nation who would even plan to usesuch technologies for war, violence or harm would be immediately stopped. Wecannot release these technologies and then pretend that there is not going to beanother Hitler or Saddam Hussein or Pol Pot.It does mean that today we have the means to monitor such matters and the meansto enforce a stable peace. Technologies now exist in the covert world that, usedby those ardent for peace, could monitor and stop any harmful application ofthese new energy systems in real time.We must be realistic: Everyone isn't going to go instantly into samadhi andenlightenment and become non-violent and peaceful. We are humans.But, there are enough good people in the world and enough good leaders in theworld to provide the leadership we need. When there is an abusive or potentiallydangerous character who arrives on the scene, the policy should be thefollowing: Every civilized country on earth should rise up and stop him beforeit becomes a problem.If this policy had really been followed, World War I would have never happened,nor would World War II. Today, the means of communication and monitoring exist,but the question is: Is the will power and the intent there to enforce thepeace?Take for example Saddam Hussein and his chemical weapons. Who provided him withthe technology and chemicals? The Germans and Americans and French did, withsome help from the Russians. Rumsfeld himself was involved in this technologytransfer to Saddam.And how did such figures acquire the wealth to secure these weapons programs?Oil.It has nothing to do about whether or not we can do it, and the sooner peoplelearn this lesson, the better. The state of the world is manipulated by thosewho benefit most from conflict.We certainly didn't learn this lesson after World War I, and we didn't learn itafter World War II. And here we are now.So the question is: Just exactly what has to happen before the body politiclearns this lesson?We have already hit peak oil production, and we are going to become like \"MadMax\", the movie, fighting over the last barrel of oil. The time has come to dothe right thing, and move our civilization to its next level of development.Are we willing to live with the rule of law, like a civilized world, or are wegoing to be cowardly and look the other way when rogue and illegal operationsand 'Murder Incorporated' run roughshod over the interests of the people?235Once we disclose effectively the existence of these technologies, the publicwill say, \"We want them\"! Billy Bob, with his eight-cylinder pickup, doesn'twant to pay ten dollars a gallon to run his truck down the road. There areforces that will bring these concerns to a head, and they are inevitable. Andinevitably we will come out on the other side of this, and the world willembrace this vision.But the question is: How much chaos and stupidity will transpire before we comeout on the other side? That is the only question. Humans are, as a group,survivors, and when push comes to shove, we will survive.I welcome the fact that releasing these technologies would require us to createan enforceable, sustainable, peaceful civilization just to survive. We're at thepoint now where every one knows we can't put off much longer dealing with theselarge structural and environmental issues. So when a solution comes along, itwill focus people's attention and finally require us to do what we should havedone decades ago.Without peace there can be no further progress on earth. The simple truth isthis: We have reached the point in human evolution where the only possiblefuture is a peaceful one.Now, there are many people who argue: \"Oh, we're never peaceful and we'll alwaystry to kill each other.\"The truth is most people don't want to go around murdering each other. Out ofsix billion people, most are actually very nice peaceful people.Unfortunately we have not been willing to restrain the few rabid dogs thatroutinely like to attack the flock.In super-secret projects, there are people who fantasize about using thesetechnologies to go into space, like 'Star Wars', with guns blazing. Buttechnologies that go beyond the crossing point of light cannot be applied for aweapon system and have a people survive its use, any more than we could havesurvived a thermonuclear launch.Some in these covert projects have misinterpreted certain ET actions: Forexample, when we tried to detonate a nuclear weapon on the moon, to show theUSSR how powerful America was, an extraterrestrial vehicle came in andintercepted it and destroyed it. Now, you could take that to be evidence thatthese ETs were hostile towards us, when in reality they were trying to protectfacilities on the moon, and also the sanctity of space as a peaceful place freefrom weapons of mass destruction.But from the shoes of those humans who wanted to see that moon detonationhappen, their frustration could lead to the assumption that this ET action wasproof of their hostility!A number of such events have happened, where humans have misinterpreted ETactions as evidence of hostility, when in reality it was evidence ofenlightenment.236These extraterrestrial civilizations are simply trying to contain an immatureand out-of-control militarized civilization on earth from escaping the biosphereand going out into space.But depending on your perspective, you can view it as one way or another. I amquite certain that the ET intent is peaceful. But if you wanted to spin such anevent to, say, President Reagan, or to someone else inclined to support StarWars, you could cite that event and say, \"See, there is a threat we're facing.We need to build up weapons in space and hit them hard!\"I am not speaking theoretically as I give you these examples. These are thingsthat have actually happened and have led to justifications for targetingextraterrestrial vehicles and weaponizing space.We have Disclosure Project witnesses to ET events where 16 to 18intercontinental ballistic missiles were taken offline completely, instantly.(see Bob Salas' testimony in Chapter 29.)And when I asked them, \"What do you think the ETs were saying?\" They say,\"We think they were trying to tell us, please don't blow up this beautifulplanet.\"Now, you could take that same event and come to a different assessment, and say,\"Well they are interfering with our national security preparedness. They weremaking us vulnerable to the Soviets\".The same action can be interpreted different ways, depending on whether you arein a paranoid mindset and are motivated by aggrandizing your military-industrialbudget.ET actions have shown us on many occasions, that if we were to engage in actsthat would jeopardize the survivability of life on earth, they would interveneand stop it— and they could do it very quickly.This was demonstrated over and over again -- the launch at Vandenburg AFB whichwas intercepted and destroyed, the moon intercept, taking these 16intercontinental ballistic missiles offline. I am certain the extraterrestrialcivilizations were trying to tell us, \"Don't go down the path of mutuallyassured destruction, but if you do, we can stop it.\"Now, what a lot of people don't know is that similar events were happening inRussia at exactly the same time. ET actions were trying to say to all theseparties on earth: \"Make peace, and don't go down this path of massdestruction—and if you try, we're going to stop you anyway.\"They weren't trying to give the Soviets an advantage over us, if they were doingthe same things in the Soviet Union at the same time!ET civilizations certainly are not going to let us send these weapons intospace.237And if we try, they will be tossed back like a bad penny.When covert shadow government operations have tried to go out in space with ARVsand other super-advanced spacecraft, they have been shut down.A Defense Intelligence Agency witness told me that we had a number ofsophisticated satellite systems that were pointed out into space -- not down tothe Soviet Union. They were being used to track and target extraterrestrialvehicles out in space. He said the ET s were routinely shutting these systemsdown, out of self-defense. But such actions angered the 'Masters of theUniverse' types who are not accustomed to having their plans frustrated.So, if you wanted to spin such events to people inclined towards paranoia andmilitarism, it would be easy to do. And that is what's happened over the last 50years.A president or other high official is vulnerable to this \"cherry-picking ofintelligence,\" and a xenophobic spin being placed on events. And who else isavailable to such officials to provide another perspective? This is one of thereal risks of closed, secret systems.But ETs want us to solve our own dysfunction; they will intervene significantlyand openly only in the case of global thermonuclear war, a massive geophysicalcollapse, or in the event that humans take actions that would upset the order ofpeace in the universe.This is not the route of first choice, because if one culture moves into anotherculture and tries to artificially impose something, it is almost universally afailure.The idea that extraterrestrial civilizations will come to earth, and impose somenew order is a fantasy. These are lessons that we have to learn as a people whoare stumbling out of childhood's end and into maturity and adulthood.Extraterrestrial civilizations have been observing our development for many,many, years -- maybe thousands and perhaps millions. They will not let oneperverse generation destroy a biosphere that has been in development forbillions of years, or a world that is intended to be here for hundreds ofthousands to millions of years to come as a place for the development ofintelligent life and enlightenment.There have always been two space programs. There is the conventional spaceprogram that my uncle worked in. He was the senior project engineer with Grummandesigning the lunar module, using jet thrusters etc.A parallel space program exists using more advanced technologies, includingearly anti-gravity spacecraft capable of going faster than the speed of light.But Earth is under a type of cosmic quarantine. It is known that we are not yetsocially and spiritually evolved enough to go into space with such advancedtechnologies - and so our wings are clipped for now. The key to our beingwelcome in the cosmos is peace.238There are entire worlds that don't even have a concept of war that are highlydeveloped and are at or beyond our level of technological achievement. So aworld like ours would be enormously risky to turn loose on the cosmos; we arejust still too violent and primitive.Our ability to utilize all the technologies we have developed covertly has beentruncated by extraterrestrial enforcement of a type of quarantine. They arecharged with protecting the universe from a species whose technologies have wayoutstripped their social and spiritual development. This is manifest universaljustice. It would be the height of insanity and folly to turn militaristichumans loose on the cosmos!Neil Armstrong was over-heard saying as we landed on the moon, there werenumerous extraterrestrial vehicles on the crater, watching us and that we wereessentially warned off the moon.Now think about it. During the height of the cold war, the space program wasreally a military asset: It was a race to the moon competitively with theSoviets, and plans were in place to put military assets on the moon. Theextraterrestrial people do not want us carving up other worlds into \"us versusthem,\" territories, thus exporting human conflict into space. It will not beallowed.Now, again, if you wanted to spin that in a certain way, you could say, \"See!There is a threat.\" When in reality what they are doing is protecting space fromconflict and warfare.But, if we go out into space, united and in peace, the universe is an open bookfor us.There are artificial structures on the moon that predate the 1969 lunar landing.Some of them are very old while others look newer and functional.There are extraterrestrial assets that are out in space on a fairly permanentbasis, and underneath the surface of Mars there are extensive extraterrestrialfacilities.These ancient ET facilities on the moon and Mars, as well as ancient evidence ofET visitation to Earth, have led some to suggest that humans have been partlyassisted in our evolution by ET genetic augmentation. I believe this is likelyand logical. There certainly is a missing link in the time line of ourevolution, and it is likely that advanced civilizations assisted and augmentedour species.Now, when I say that, I am very careful not to, at the same time, say that weare \" created\" by ETs. I believe that there is an infinite God that creates allof us. But that doesn't mean that as a physician I can't assist or fix aproblem. These are not mutually exclusive dynamics, except to scientific andreligious fundamentalists. People may ask, \"Well, if that is the case, does itmean that there is a God?\"239Well, of course. There can be a divine Creator who also moves and operatesthrough the relative world, and through channels and through means. And we arethose channels and means. And so are peoples from other planets.I have contacts at JPL (Jet Propulsion Labs) who have told me that they know thestructures on the moon and Mars are ancient, and that for theological andreligious reasons, this information is being suppressed. The orthodoxy ofconventional religious dogma would be up-ended by such a revelation.The existence of an infinite Creator and the likelihood that there have beendevelopments that have assisted the evolution of humans as part of a divine planare not mutually exclusive concepts. In fact, I find them to be quitecomplementary -- advanced theological ideas perhaps, but not inconsistent withthe fundamental reality of the existence of an intelligent supreme Being.Because if we can apprehend, however dimly, the intent of God or a divine plan,why can't others— including extraterrestrials? And then why can't they actwithin that knowledge?There is a universal form of intelligent species. It appears that the non-localmorphogenic propagation of an upright being with a head, bi-morphism with twoarms and two legs is a universal constant.In Sheldrake's morphogenic fields, there is the concept that once a patterndevelops that works, it tends to then replicate, and not only replicate throughknown and local means, but through non-local connections in remote places at thesame time.It's like the hundredth monkey phenomenon where you have one island with apopulation of monkeys learning a skill, and all of a sudden, at a distant place,with no direct contact, the other monkeys begin to do the same thing.So there is a non-local transfer of patterns of evolution and knowledge thattakes place. If you understand the power of consciousness, and the fact thatmind is always omnipresent, and is the ultimate non-local integrator, it becomesclear that our thoughts and our prayers and vision can have a non-local effectall over the earth, and throughout the universe.One of the central purposes of the CSETI expeditions is for the entire group tobe in that state of unity consciousness and see and co-create a universe that isat peace.The state of unity consciousness has material effects as well. You have heardaccounts of remote healing. Well, how does that happen? You have two peopleremoved in space and yet a healing is effected. This happens because everythingis non-local. We don't recognize it, but in reality even matter is awake-ness,mind-stuff, phasing in a different resonance frequency.And so space, matter, and time are intimately and at all times connected toconsciousness.240But consciousness is a singularity. It is indivisible. We divide it in ourintellectual mind, but this is an artificial construct: the reality is thatconsciousness is perfectly integrated and omnipresent, and that's why there canbe remote healing. That is why there can be telepathy. That is why you can breakoutside the bounds of space and time and see a distant point in space or time oreffect a remote change. The nature of mind itself is always non-local. It isalways in a state where it is in its fullness, everywhere, at every time, in anomnipresent manner.This is why even physical systems, engineering systems or genetic systems can beevolving in one place, and if it is very successful, begin to propagatenon-locally elsewhere in another part of the universe. This is non-local nodalpropagation through the perfect integrating quality of consciousness.241"},{"pageContent":"35 A GUIDED MEDITATION: THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE\"You can experience everything, from the Unbounded to the manifest, to distantplaces in time and space, through the perfectly integrating, connecting effectof pure mind or consciousness.\"You can do this guided meditation with a friend or in a group with one personreading; or you can go to the www.cseti.org and get the CD.Now let's close our eyes. Be in a relaxed state. Allow yourself to hear andunderstand, but also see and experience as we share the unfolding of the orderand structure of the cosmos from the infinite to the most manifest creation.And as we sit here in silence, at this beautiful spot on earth, let us begin tocenter within ourselves, and sense that we are awake.Now take some deep breaths of this pure, life-filled air, and allow yourdiaphragm to expand as you inhale through your nose, and then exhale fullythrough your mouth.And as you inhale, see your entire mind and body being filled with the life andlight and energy around us, and as you exhale, see yourself becoming completelyrelaxed, and all stresses and all negativity leaving your mind and your body,and being swept away in the wind and cleansed by the infinite wisdom of MotherEarth.With each breath, bring in a new and higher level of energy and awake-ness, andwith each expiration, dive deeper in a state of complete silence and relaxationand release yourself of any limitations or negativity; let them be swept away inthe vast-ness and the purifying influence of earth.Feel yourself breathing with Mother Earth as she gives us this air and as shetakes from us the breath as we exhale, and breathe in the conscious life andlight of this infinitely wise mother, and release into the earth, all of yourworries and concerns, all of your pain and suffering, and find yourself in astate of perfect equanimity and peace.242Now, very gently, without straining the mind, allow yourself to observe your ownbreath as it goes in and out, as you are in a perfect state of quiet and peace.And as you are observing your breath, gently see the awake mind that is watchingthe breath; see it is steady and ever present.What is watching the breath? See that there is an awake-ness within yourselfthat is steady and unchanging, observing all things. Peaceful. And as you seeyour breath rising and falling, going in and out, in this beautiful peacefulstate, you also see that the mind that is watching quietly, is an infinite oceanof awake-ness.Now we dive into this vast ocean and allow ourselves to go very very deeply intoquiet and peaceful conscious mind that observes all things. And we behold thatthe breath of our life, the sounds around us, the thoughts that rise and falland come and go within the mind— all that we hear and see and feel and touch andknow is submerged in this vast ocean of awake-ness.And very gently we go ever more deeply into that awake mind. And we see thateven our individuality, that which we call \"I,\" ourselves, is but a window -- avery clear and pure window -- through which this infinite light of awareness isshining. And in this moment we see, as we dive now more deeply into this oceanof consciousness, that it is an infinite single omnipresent field of awake-ness,as it shines through our own individuality, and it is this awake-ness whichenables us to watch our breath, to hear the sounds, to see the sights, toobserve the thoughts, and to even apprehend our own selves.Leaving then, this small self behind, let us dive completely in freedom as wewould into an infinite ocean, this beautiful and infinite conscious mind, and wesee then that we are awake and that this awake-ness is a singularity, alwaysindivisible, shining within all beings, and that every one of us sitting heretogether, and every being on earth, and every being in the cosmos is awake bythis same unbroken indivisible light of consciousness -- the mind in itsunbounded and infinite true nature.Then, soaring on the wings of this infinite mind, as we would through thevastness of a fathomless ocean, we see that each of us is one, and that thissilent, absolute, infinite and eternal awake Being is standing within allthings, shining within each atom, moving every photon, illuminating every soul,shining from every star.And we see in this instant that the entirety of creation and all that exists, isthis same awake-ness, shining, moving, phasing, in unique shapes and forms. Butit is all one. It is indivisible. It is eternal.Within the field of this absolute awake-ness, we see that because it is beyondspace, it is infinite, and because it is not bound by any point in time, it isinfinite and eternal.And yet in its fullness, without division, it is present at every point in spaceand every point in time, and in this we see the state of divine perfection,perfect harmony. And being thus centered, in this awake-ness, which is infinite,we now be-243gin to explore the structure of the cosmos. And we see that this omnipresentawake-ness, and the infinite manifest creation, are perfectly one, and yetwithin the sphere of that which is relative, there are distinctions.Being then established in this infinite cosmic Mind, let us gaze into the finestlevel of its manifestation as this infinite Being, and this eternal Mind,through the operation of its own will, takes on the form of the Creator. Movingthen within the realm of infinity, the Creator aspect of this infinite Mind andBeing exists as the primal source that manifests and maintains the entireuniverse and the entire creation.And the first emanation from this infinite and absolute Mind is a sound, athought, the sound vibration of which has within it the seed sound and idea ofall that has been, all that is, and all that will be.And from this primal thought issuing forth from the infinite and divine Onenessof the conscious being of the Divine Mind, we see the cosmos becoming manifestand differentiated. And from this primal thought issuing forth from the morn ofeternity, we see within this primal thought and sound, the thought and seed ideafor all things, all places, all ideas, all structures, all forms, all sounds—all that can be and will ever be and ever was in the entirety of creation.And so we perceive this primal thought and this primal sound— which are one—differentiating into an infinite number of realities. And within one we can seea star. And within another we see an apple. And within another, we see our ownindividuality and self, and within another we see our friends, and withinanother we see the grass, and within another we see the wolf, and within anotherwe see the earth, and within another we see other worlds...Thus in infinite progression, the seed idea forms, each with their own primalthought and sound issuing forth from this most great thought, through theoperation of will of the Creator, rises forth from the silent eternal Being.And as we perceive this becoming more manifest, we see within this great Being,the most great Light. And from this primal thought, and this most elementalsound, issues forth the form of the perfect light, the perfect form, which haswithin it all of the creation, and the infinite cosmic creation suffused inlight, emerges and unfolds within our vision.And in this most great Light, we see then the of form of all that there can be.And within this world of light— an ocean of infinite light— we see that everyform is manifest and corresponding to the sound and thought vibration for anapple, issuing from the primal thought and tone, we behold the astral light formof an apple. And so too, with each created thing, whether it be a wolf, or atree, or a star, or a world. And all of it is there, both in perfect onenesswith the awake mind of the Creator, who created it, and in its own fullness as aperfect creation, first in thought, then in form, and then light.244And so we see this infinite light expanding and becoming differentiated, and thevast celestial worlds unfold before our vision and worlds infinite and divineare stretched out around us, in all directions, infinitely extending throughspace and time.And so we behold the structure and the light of the celestial blueprint for theentirety of creation and the universe and all that exists within the world ofchange and expression and time and space.And as this begins to become more differentiated, we see that within this worldof light, exists the perfect sound and seed idea of each thing, and within eachsound is the primal sound, and as we dive more deeply, we see the Creator Itselfmanifesting the entire creation, pouring within it, this unbroken awake mind,whereby we are conscious at this moment, in this time, in this space.And seeing this firmly within us, we now behold the material creation beingsupported through the fine crystalline form of the world of astral light, andemanating from the blueprints of the form within the astral worlds of light,emerge the baseline form of energy which supports every atom, which supportsevery electron, which supports all the forces of creation and of the materialcosmos.And so we see, emerging, manifesting and expressing from this vast celestialcreation, the differentiated and perfect worlds of light, and then the physicalreality of the expressed universe.And so we see our own star, the sun, emerging from this perfect astral sun,which has emerged from the most great Light, and which has within it the perfectidea form from the sun, emerging from the primal sound and primal thought,issuing forth from the sovereign will of the infinite Creator.And with each thing we contemplate, we see it unfolding before us, whether it bea blade of grass, an animal, our own individualities and bodies, worlds far fromhere with peoples who are conscious as we are— all of it, emerging from thisperfect template of the astral worlds of light which are unfolding from the mostgreat Light, and the finest level of the primal thought, which has within it thefirst emanation of sound coming forth from the morn of eternity.And as we dive even further, we are left on the edge of the infinite, thetimeless, and the eternal.And so we see this perfect unity between the infinite Mind, whereby we areconscious and awake, and our own existence.And the awake-ness whereby each of us is conscious, can never be divided fromthis single awake Being, standing within all things; we are never divided, andnever separate from anything.245And then as we gaze in all directions around us, we behold a perfect divineorder and that this great Being, from time to time has sent to earth and toother worlds Avatars or Manifestations of divinity, who enliven entire worldsand refresh in a new springtime the entire creation.And we are filled with happiness as we see that the time of a new springtime hasarrived and an era of a thousand years of unbroken peace and enlightenment aredawning upon the earth and upon every world in creation, within the entirecosmos.Seeing then, in perfection the creation, the Creator and the Infinite Mind, weare now aware that it is true that every created thing is a doorway to theInfinite, and that the unbounded and infinite Being is truly omnipresent,omniscient, ever-abiding at every point in space and time and at every level ofcreation. And that indeed folded within us and within all things, is a perfectquantum hologram of all that there is.And thus the entire universe is folded within us, and that our ownindividualities, which are part of the creation, have issued forth from theCreator— and our highest state of realization is to be as nothing and to bestill.And we see that we are clear windows through which the infinite light of thegreat Being is shining.And the awake Mind whereby we are conscious at this instant, is the eternalBeing, the infinite Self, the cosmic Mind, from which all things, all time, allspace is emanating.Now, let our minds rest at that point of the first emanation where awake-nessbegins to become relative existence, where the absolute phases into the relativeexistence of the cosmos and of creation. We see that within this most greatthought is the seed idea of all knowledge. And at this level, every thing may beknown. All knowledge exists; every science, every art, every fact, every truth.And that is folded within the reality of man and is a fountain that can giveforth all knowledge, all science, and all truth. And we may learn to go to thisspot, this place of the placeless within us, and to see the truth, and tounravel the sciences and to know the facts and to perceive reality.On the wings of this infinite awake Mind within us we realize that we areintegrated in perfect harmony, indivisibly, with every point in space and time.Through gently, subtly using the free will given to us by the Creator, inaccordance with the divine will, all things are possible and all life isbenefited. Humbly turning to this unbounded Being, we may then awaken to adistant point in space or time and perceive what is happening in that place andin that time.And so it is, that perchance we may fall asleep one night and perceive what willhappen the next day or the next year or the next century, because folded withinus is all time and all space. The nature of the mind within us is omnipresent,and is present within every point of creation— at every point in time and space.246Thus we see the entirety of the universe is open to us because the most greatMind, the single awake Being, is standing within all of us. And this infiniteocean of awake-ness, which can never be divided, is that whereby we are awake.It is that whereby we are always conscious. And if we become silent and still,we may perceive this silent Mind, and we may meditate upon the truth, and we maysee any point in space and we may ask any question and find the answer.And so it is that we — meaning all advanced intelligent beings— have thecapacity to be at one with the unbounded Being, and to use our free will todiscern the divine will, and to put ourselves at service to the divine plan.And this is the apex of the achievement of our being. As we sit upon the earth,we are called to answer the needs of this time and place, even though we seethat we are established in this eternal home and this infinite space.And from this deep and abiding conscious Being, on the wings of this infiniteAwareness, we rise into the sky above us, and we are all one in spirit and thisspirit is indivisible. And in this infinite Mind, we see the Earth herself, abeautiful blue planet submerged in the infinity of space.And Earth is an awake being herself. We see this awake being, and we feel at onewith her, as her children, and yet in perfect oneness with the awake-nesswhereby she has her own existence. And as we gaze around the Earth, we see thespace of our solar system, and we see the Earth's sisters and brothers, theother planets, and Father Sun. And we see the space around us is filled withinfinite light and infinite energy, and that it is not empty but full, and it isnot dead space, but it is awake mind.We see that the entirety of space is conscious. And on the wings of thatawake-ness, the same awake-ness folded within us, we soar through the infinityof space and we behold myriad worlds and we see the entire spiral galaxy of theMilky Way, and expanding further, we go into intergalactic space, and we seebillions of galaxies, infinite worlds stretching out beyond us, within us, andthe fullness of that unbounded space is that vast ocean of mind within us.We are always one with this cosmic Being, and we are always awake through thecosmic Mind. And at will we may then travel throughout the cosmos, and gaze uponevery world and see every star system.Being in this state of cosmic consciousness, we see beyond the infiniteconscious material universe, and see the infinite astral worlds of light withinthem, and beyond we see the perfect idea form and sound sustaining the forms oflight and the infinite material cosmos. And we are one with the Creator and weare one with creation.We see that the Creator and the creation are one. And that within us, we are al-247ways one with it. Being in this state of unity we ask the celestial realm, theangelic beings, the Manifestations of God, and every conscious and enlightenedbeing in the cosmos, to join us as we gaze upon the earth and we invite themhere. As we see the earth at this time, we see that it is emerging into a timeof enlightenment. And we ask the infinite God, as all of us focus on the earth,to transform every dark thought into enlightenment, and to send into everyselfish heart, the infinite love of the divine, and that wherever there ishatred, that it be replaced with affection and love, and wherever there is greedand selfishness, that it be replaced with altruism and generosity.Those forces on earth that we see wandering in the ignorance of hatred andgreed, we see being illumined with the light of knowledge and love and peace.Within the heart of the reality of earth and her people, we see a beautifulgolden light dawning, and we see the earth transformed into a rose garden ofpeace. As she goes forward from this point onward, Earth becomes one of thediadems of creation, one of the genuine repositories of peace and knowledge inthe cosmos.In this state of peace, all peoples turn to the earth and are filled with joybecause the time of the fulfillment of the promise of humanity has arrived, andwe are here to witness that time and to usher in that reality.We see ourselves joined by beings celestial, astral, and extraterrestrial, andall the good people on earth joining with us in the exercise of our will, weddedto the divine Being as we manifest that time of enlightenment and an unbrokenperiod of thousands of years of peace.Sitting quietly now, we see that we are joined by the angelic realm, thecelestial beings, the astral worlds filled with our ancestors and with thebeings from diverse worlds. And we see that there are extraterrestrial peoplesjoining us, and that there are people on this planet who are joining us inconscious thought and prayer. And we hold within us this thought, and thisvision of suffusing the earth in this golden light as it is brought in to thistime of peace, and all the wars will be silenced and all the suffering will end.Injustice will give way to justice, and poverty to abundance, and fromdestruction we will go into a time of beautiful and perfect architecture and aperfect and enlightened social order.As we see this within us, we now are certain that it will come to pass. We seethat we are joined by worlds infinite and divine, as well as material andextraterrestrial. The time has arrived for the old and corrupt ways to end andfor the old order to be rolled up and for a new world to be unfurled, thehallmark of which will be oneness, peace, and unbroken enlightenment forthousands of generations of children on the earth.248"},{"pageContent":"36 BOUNDLESS MINDKnow that every stable star system has planets. And every one of those solarsystems has life forms, beings capable of knowing the Divine Mind. So as we gazeinto the space around us, we see that this enlightened awake Being, this Mindwhereby we are conscious, which is always omnipresent, is shared by thosebeings, and that this is the foundation of inter-planetary peace. Therequirement for world peace, and the first point of enlightenment for everybeing is that they recognize that within them exists this cosmic mind, whichgives them the light of awareness, the one spirit within them.And so we are always one in spirit, and the great Spirit is always one andindivisible.We welcome these beings here, in whatever form they may appear -- whether theybe a materialized ship, or a message or a tone, or a light, or an etheric craft,shimmering in the field around us. But whatever is seen and heard, that isalways less important than what is known within us. And we see that we areawake, and that these beings who are similarly enlightened and conscious areseeing us through their mind's eye, even as we are seeing them. And this divineeye of oneness is shared by all intelligent life.As an ambassador from Earth to their people, with humility we invite them here,always letting them know that they may appear in any form or shape or mannerthat is safe and appropriate for this time, recognizing that Earth is verydangerous right now, and that safety is paramount. We know that they may see usand we may see them effortlessly through this inner sight which all of uspossess, because all of us are awake. And that awake-ness is omnipresent.As time goes on, there will be no distinction between the spirituallyenlightened ones, and those who we consider for political or leadershippositions. You won't be allowed to be a leader if you are not enlightened. Itwill be like the time of the philosopher kings.249Keep in mind also that there are ETs underground and under bodies of water thatare increasingly staying in this etheric form, but ready to respond, if there isa need. And so frequently you'll see a craft or an etheric aspect of the craftemerging from underneath the earth rather than come in from outer space.Once in Colorado, while on an expedition, we felt the earth move and lift rightunder our feet. And then we could see all around us a craft, and the temperaturerose 10 or 15 degrees. We were in an etheric craft that was translucent, but youcould see the shape of it and the dimensions of it and the beings moving withinit.Since the electronics of these technologies allow matter to transform throughthe crossing point of the speed of light and solid matter into this etheric,near-astral form, it means they can go straight through solid matter, straightthrough mountains, as if it is not there.Even classified human projects have technologies that do that. They can be in astate where they are not detected at all and yet are present.The fact is, then, most people won't know that they're there. Some will, butmost will not. And the more they fully come into the material three-dimensionalspace-time dimension, the more their craft is vulnerable to current humantechnologies and being targeted.These are very powerful propulsion systems and electronics. If they do fullymaterialize, we let them approach us. We don't go running towards them. It isnot safe, and it is unwise.When you're in a small group and you do this protocol, often people will juststretch out and fall asleep, and then go into a dream state.And in that state, often people will be able to let go of their internal blocksand see the ETs even better. Remember, they are frequently in the etheric ornear astral form, and very easily can interact with our astral bodies, which arewhat is activated during the lucid dream state.In that state, or when we are awake and centered in cosmic awareness, the ETswill draw more closely. Why? Because it is safer for them when we're notconnected just to our small selves, our fearful selves, and our egos.As Krishna said to Arjuna on the battlefield, \"A little of This\" -- capital \"T\"-- \"eliminates all fear.\" The 'This' is boundless Mind.In that state, there is no reason to be afraid. And therefore they are morecomfortable with us because we can connect to them as awake beings. It is abeautiful experience.And they can relate to us because we're connecting to that universal aspect ofourselves— the only aspect of us that is universal. But it's also the core ofour beings. So by connecting to that we are ready and receptive and able toconnect to them.The single greatest determinative factor for contact is the state ofconsciousness that you're in.250What is most important about the contact protocol is taking the time to settleand center into consciousness quietly. It is done in the following phases:First, sit quietly, and do some meditative technique that enables you to be intouch with just being awake -- whatever works for you. Second, once you're awareof that awake-ness, go through the process of expanding it, sensing and seeingthat it isn't just bound to your individual space right here, that it is reallya universal awareness.Third, on the wings of that universal awake-ness, allow yourself to awaken to orsee -- \"remotely view,\"— space. You can literally just scan space freely, or letyour mind be drawn to an extraterrestrial craft. Be careful not to just imagineit; let it actually unfold and come into your vision, where you actuallyperceive it. Fourth, once you see an ET or an ET ship, connect to theextraterrestrial being, by reconnecting to your own inner awake-ness, and see inthe inner awake-ness shining from their eyes.And in that state of oneness, invite them to be with you here, in whatever waythat is safe and appropriate.An advanced version is also to connect to the interplanetary center or council,to check and get permission and say, \"Please allow them to come or bring themhere,\" or be with them.Fifth, you then guide them to your precise location. Show them. It is almostlike you're zooming in from space, and you show them visually your exactlocation, connecting to their mind or to their guidance system or both— becausetheir technologies are connected to their consciousness. Remember -- that's howthey are traveling through space. That is how their guidance systems work andhow they fly the craft. It is all with mind connecting; their mind, body and thecraft are all perfectly integrated. The spaceship itself is a bio-machine thatis awake and has conscious intelligence associated with it.You can sit in a small group and use this protocol for an hour or two. It isvery powerful when a group of people practice this together.Once when an etheric ET was at one of these expeditions, we offered a crystal tothis being. As I extended my hand to give this beautiful crystal to the ET, weall looked at my hand, and it morphed in front us and changed; it elongated, andthen had only three fingers- and looked just like the ET's hand!All of us saw that. It was like his hand and my hand became one. All of us sawmy hand completely change.So the way that these ETs can appear is really amazing. And it can be shockingbe cause it seems so bizarre. It would be hard to even create a science fictionmovie that would contain as much high strangeness as we have actually seen andexperienced on these expeditions.251As we gather here under the stars, remember this wonderful time together, andsee that we are always connected in this state of oneness, and that we're goingto work together to make it through this time into the time that we have seen.252"},{"pageContent":"37 THE DROP AND THE OCEAN ARE ONEThere is a wonderful saying, \"Knowledge is a single point, but the foolish havemultiplied it.\"The direct perception of mind is very simple, but there is a lot of detail abouthow it all is expressed that we can discuss. We are sitting at this point inspace and yet, at the same time, folded within this point, is that which isbeyond time and space. This activity is emanating from infinity and therelativity itself is infinite and the creation itself is not limited. The cosmositself has no end in time or space, any more than the unbounded Mind has endingin time or space. The creation is the infinite outer garb of the inner unboundedMind, and all of it together is the great Being.Can you see that?It is very easy to sit quietly and experience mind in its subtle, unboundednature, and see the reality around us. We have to go from being awake andlightly focused, to simply being, and reflecting and seeing within ourselves theawake-ness.We identify consciousness with our egos, because it's shining within us- but itis also beyond self at the same time. Look into the eyes of those around you.See they are awake. And even though they're different, the consciousness itselfis the same - the awake mind-stuff within them is one: We are all one in Spirit.That whereby they are conscious is the same awake-ness whereby you're awake.Their individualities are different, their intellects are different, theirbodies are different, but the awake-ness itself is a singularity. And so we areall one and we have always been one. And we have never been separate.And if you acknowledge and experience this unity, then you can be one withanyone else, and you can be one with the animals and the trees and the stars andthe extraterrestrials, and those within the covert government and the WhiteHouse and everywhere.No place is barred from you. No being is a stranger and no place is strange. Theentire cosmos is your home.253And this is not an intellectual realization alone. It is experienced. And allthose worlds that we were traveling through, and all those inner states, to eachand every one of them you will no doubt attain... Our individualities arewindows through which infinity is expressing itself. At some point, we learn atwill to take this drop and let it go back into the ocean, and then, at will,reconstitute the drop and be individual again.This is what we learn to do through the course of our spiritual journey. 'Be asnothing, and then walk upon the water.'So the drop of our individuality can become one with the ocean, and then we arethe ocean. At the same instant we can realize that we are still that individualdrop— in a state of unity consciousness.We can perceive this not only within ourselves, but we see that all things andall beings and the earth beneath our feet is all awake, infinite Being.We realize it is all sacred— the entirety of creation is sacred and every beingis sacred, because spirit, the awake Being, is the very fabric of all that thereis. And it is always perfectly one, even if it's playing and displaying uponitself as if it is different.The challenge is to see the oneness within the difference, and also enjoy thedifference.We have been in places all over the world that have just the most horribleweather, and we will sit and do this meditation and prayer, and within minutes,the whole sky will clear- it is an opening that happens above this state ofconsciousness. And this has happened hundreds of times -- almost inexplicably,no matter how bad or stormy the weather.The question is: Is there interplay between oneness and duality? They co-exist.They are not mutually exclusive. In other words, the relative and the changing,time and space and matter and the infinite silent absolute are the same. There'sno separation, and therefore there's no duality.Now, that which is relative has differentiation. We have individual bodies,there is male and there is female, there are different energies, there aredifferent elements. But at the same time, there is this perfect divine unity andawake-ness that co-exists with it, suffuses all of it, and permeates all of it.There is a balance in being able to see the differentiation and the duality ofthings, and at the same time see the oneness that is permeating all the duality.So it isn't an either-or question.Everything is established and emanating from unbounded, absolute,undifferentiated, pure Mind. But it is perceived as one or the other. Our taskis to evolve to a point where we see it not as either-or, but all as one, evenwhile we see the distinctions.254 Even experiments that have been done with mechanical systems or devices, such asthose done by Dr. Robert Jahn of Princeton, show that mind is connected tomatter.How does that happen? It is because the material object itself is mind, isawake-ness — phasing, resonating as that thing.It takes practice, but the perception of Oneness begins to come back and forth,back and forth, back and forth— until you see that there is no back and forth.It is all one. The drop and the ocean are one, even when the drop can bedistinguished.It is useful sometimes to simply look and sit quietly and be with other people,and then become aware of the fact that they're awake and you're awake.Now, subtract all the differences and be left with the awake-ness itself, and gointo that state of being awake within yourself, and then see that you are freedfrom self and individuality so that you can connect to the awake-ness of others,and be one.And in this sense, we are all one being. We are truly all one in spirit, andtherefore we can relate to and find within ourselves genuine compassion.Expanding that idea, consider the fact that every person on earth, everysentient being in the cosmos, whether angelic or astral or deceased humans, orextraterrestrial people with bodies and material existences on other planets --all of those awake beings are capable of being aware of awareness, and thereforecan enter into a state of oneness -- intentional oneness that is transcendentaland perfect.Now, that state is beyond the peace of a political peace, which has been calledat times, \"the lesser peace.\"What I am describing now is the most great peace— the perfect peace that isinner and spiritual. Because in that state you see indeed that we are all one inSpirit.Thus, any source of conflict ceases to exist, because instead of being centeredin difference, people will be centered in oneness -- and not just as anintellectualization or philosophical perspective, but a genuine experience inenlightenment, and that is an enlightened state of being.Oh, my God, it is beautiful.All that you need has been given to you. It is all within you. All I am doing istrying to unfold an understanding and then you can do it yourself.At the same time there is oneness, there is relativity. We are sitting here. Wedo have distinct bodies. There is space and time and stars and distance. Thosecoexist. They are not mutually exclusive concepts at all -- in fact, they areperfectly integrated.255And so, understanding the nuance between the absolute and the relative is reallyimportant, because that is the journey our souls are traversing. And becomingproficient in that understanding and experience enables you to manifest fromthis state of infinite awareness into this existence.Without the fundamental experience and understanding of silent infiniteawareness and how that absolute Unbounded-ness becomes manifest into therelative, you cannot reach your fulfillment as a being.Wherever there is form within it is astral light. And there is the pure ideaform and awareness, that is the causal -- the level of the cosmology that is inthat idea seed-form. The infinite Awareness manifests this seed idea. It's theidea form and thought vibration of lets say an apple -- without the form andshape of an apple. Can you consider an apple without its form- just its thoughtessence?It is rather abstract, I agree. But then from that idea thought vibration, seeemerging the light and form and shape and color of an apple. See that astraltemplate becoming more and more differentiated and more manifest, emerging intothe subtle sub-electro-magnetic energies--zero point energies, magnetic forcesand other forces that then recruit and form the atoms and the molecules etceteraof the apple.This process, this divine architecture, exists with every thing -- whether it bea galaxy or a star or a person. And this is how conscious mind creates thethought-causative level of an object, and then manifests the astral and thenmanifests the physical object.What is essential is pure consciousness. Through deep silent, non- local mind,we can connect to an object and dematerialize it or rematerialize or move itacross points in space and time. This is how certain Yogi adepts have been ableto take an object and make it dematerialize and rematerialize like ateleportation device. You can connect to any object through awareness, and ifyou understand how awareness and mind-stuff becomes matter, you can affect thatobject. There is no separation whatsoever except the intellectual constructsthat we have made. We build our own cages and only we can open them.And so we have to unlearn those habituated intellectualizations, and quietlyexperience the 'unitive state'— the state of oneness. And empowered with thesubtle operation of will and an active faith, 'this will be', almost anything ispossible. Do you see what I'm saying? This will be. This is and it will be ...Without any doubt of it whatsoever.Our lives have been created this way. The fact that we are still connected toour bodies is because of this. Think about it. You build a house. You had anidea of it that emanated from your conscious mind, and then you saw it and thenyou drew it, and then you built it.This is the creative process and the Creator -- the divine Being -has createdthe entire cosmos this way. And within us is folded the same ability.256This is why it has often been said, \"He who has known his true self has verilyknown God.\"The question is: Are there different gradations within the astral realm?And the answer is absolutely yes -- just like there are different gradationswithin the material.You can be in the sewers of Manhattan or you can be in a beautiful garden. Wechoose.Within the worlds of light, there are lesser and greater worlds, and there aredifferent stations, and different levels. And when someone passes out of thisworld, and is in their astral body, remember that \"like seeketh like and takethpleasure in the company of its kind.\"That means that those of a certain level of consciousness and proclivity willgravitate to those of like mind. And they may not necessarily be pleased withtheir company. Do you see?When people speak of hell, it is a state of mind on the other side. It isbecause of your own state of mind that you are with people who are a lot likeyou. Those worlds are created through thought forms, and if those beings orpeople are thinking terrible things, they are creating terrible manifestationsaround then.You can sit and visualize a rose garden or a torture chamber. Do you see? Thatis the reality of that.Now, there are finer and finer levels of the astral that create the \"finecelestial realm,\" and the really high angelic realm. This refinement in mind,thought and energy continues until you get to the level of the station of theAvatar -- the station of the Godhead -- the Creator state.There are countless degrees of refinement -- without cessation. And that is justthe astral. Beyond that, there is the so-called idea/causal -- the essence ofwhat relative existence is. At a certain level, you may evolve to where youdon't even need to be in the astral body form, and you are in this point ofthought/ consciousness. It is very expansive, beautiful, and divine.For example, when I had my near-death experience, I didn't have a body shape. Iwas in this point of pure conscious light that was individuality and awake - itwas causal. I went straight to causal and then went into infinite Mind.The emotional texture of the astral worlds is very full and the light and thecolor are very beautiful - celestial.But the existence that is beyond that -- the causative state — is a finerfrequency. It is more essential, less differentiated and directly connected tothe pure-ness of mind and spirit.The question is: Where does reincarnation come into this cosmology?257This is an often asked question. 'The truth will set you free, but first it willpiss you off ’. So now I am going to piss off everybody.The fact is this: The mass retail teachings of reincarnation are no more truethan the mass retail teaching of other orthodoxies.The truth about reincarnation is that it is true and it is absolutely false.Remember what we just experienced. Every individuality is a unique creation. Andonce it is in creation, it exists forever as a unique thing. That individualityis here, and it will continue forever.And yet the awake mind within each of us is the same mind that is within all ofus.Every individual, by connecting to this non-local aspect of awareness, canexperience the individual life of any individual now on earth or who has everbeen on earth or who will ever be on earth or who has ever been in existenceanywhere in the universe.The description of reincarnation is therefore a misnomer. In reality, it is therealization of the oneness between individuality and infinity. That aspect ofeach of us that is the infinite Self, is also experiencing each of us. Thus, anindividual's awareness can connect to this expanded non-local awareness and thenexperience the life of another. Because in reality, we are always all one Being.Now, I have met probably five people who swear to God they were Cleopatra! Andin a sense they were: Because the awake-ness within us is universal. In thisway, an archetype person— or someone who has had an important impact as an iconwithin society or history like Cleopatra—can be experienced by certain otherrelated souls in her fullness.But does one die and kind of dissolve into nothingness and then reincarnate asJoe Cohen in Brooklyn, New York in the year 2030? No. What is understood aboutreincarnation is completely false, and yet within it is a profound truth thatdoesn't get taught because it's more abstract and nonlocal and higher ordered incomplexity.It is possible that people with individual souls will resonate with beings of asimilar nature, or overarching resonant frequency. It isn't as if one ends lifein this body, dissolves into some nothingness of the matrix of awareness, andthen becomes another being or person. That isn't it at all. It is something muchmore profound. And the profound truth is we are all beings at all times. And ifwe choose to, we can experience an individual being and life in the past, in thenow, or in the future—in its complete fullness.258Do you know who you are? Do you know that the entire universe is folded withinyou, and therefore the awake Mind within you is omnipresent and that ittranscends space and time? And you can resonate with, and experience in itscomplete fullness, all the soul experience of any being, with completecompassion?Within ourselves is an infinite and eternal conscious Being. So if youunderstand the nature of mind and consciousness within ourselves, it is veryunderstandable how we may go to sleep at night and within that relaxed state,break the bonds of space and time and see what will happen next week, or seewhat happened a thousand years ago or even experience fully the life of someonewho lived a million years ago...We are coming into the maturity of the human race and need to have a moreprofound understanding of these things, so we don't fall into superstition andsilliness, where people have to do certain rituals so they don't come back as anant!Of course, if you want to experience what it is like to be an oak tree or an antor a dog, you can. You do not have to wait for another life!When I swim with the dolphins, the reason they accept me is that they see me asone of them. They literally experience me as a dolphin. I become a dolphin.When you drop the body and go to the next level, you will have all yourmemories, you will remember every one you were with on earth, you will evolve asthis individuality through all the worlds of creation and through all the statesof consciousness. At some point, if you wish, you will be the drop returning tothe ocean.Remember, from the infinite ocean of God have we emerged, and to that infiniteocean we will all return. And this is the purpose and journey of our soul.The experience of being an individual is to learn the bliss of becoming nothingand becoming infinite again, and yet to be able to enjoy the existence and thefullness of creation.259"},{"pageContent":"38 CELESTIAL PERCEPTIONThrough the intercession of the divine beings, through the prayers of those onearth, and through their own efforts, a soul can advance from one level to thenext level; it is an infinite progression.Now, one may have to go through a lot of suffering to do that, because one mustlet go of all attachments. Suffering and attachments are synonyms.So a firmly attached belief or idea or grief is suffering.Someone wisely described hell as being in that state of remorse because you haverealized what you have done, and more importantly realized what you didn't do.True regret isn't so much about what you have done (unless you're an axemurderer or something) but is related more to what you haven't done -- theeffort you didn't expend, the kindness you didn't extend, the times you wereselfish when you should have been giving — that is where regret comes from.We have a weird way of focusing on what we have done and worrying about that,when in reality, we should be more concerned about what we are neglecting to do,that is positive and helpful to the world.These sins of omission almost always trump the sins of commission. So do notmiss an opportunity to do good, to love, to share, to sacrifice, and to take anopportunity to create a better world or to love people or to extend a kindness.Every individual created being has a certain optimal point of service andoptimal role to play, that is consonant with their own unique self.Now, what I have just described is what is called Dharma—your right work andpath. It can be something very modest to something very great within eachperson, depending on the extent to which we exercise free will to discover ourfull potential and apply it.The state of cosmic awareness I am referring to has always existed, eternally,and will always exist eternally, and it is always infinite. And the universe hasalways existed, will always exist, and is infinite. So the idea that theuniverse is limited or had a beginning or an end, is actually not correct.260The eternity of the plane of the Absolute, the awake cosmic Mind, has as itsexpressed corollary, an infinite eternal creation.So even in terms of space, as we think of it materially, there is no end to it.It's infinite. Because even if you got to the edge of what we think would be theuniverse by definition, then what's beyond that edge? It is infinite.As a young child, I used to contemplate these things all the time. I would walkaround thinking of these things and looking at the stars and sensing that,feeling that, seeing that.Even when I saw the cosmic egg, the celestial form of creation as a discreetshape and form, it was also eternal and infinite. It is a paradox... If you'relooking at the night sky with celestial vision you will see an enormous amountof light! Everything is paradoxical, and perfectly so... With astral/celestialperception, we directly see that even the depths of 'empty, dark space' isillumined with a light glowing from within. Can you see it?We can see the discrete planets and stars, spinning in an infinite ocean ofcelestial light. So it's light upon light, worlds of light all radiating fromwithin -- just as the light of a star is actually coming from within.The question is: Do all possible realities exist concurrently or on a parallelbasis, and is there communication between them?The answer to this is wholly dependent on the state of awareness of theperceiver.In other words, the answer is yes, from the perspective of a highly integratedquantum holographic view of the universe, where everything is folded within eachother. And just like a hologram, you can take one part of the universe and theentirety of the universe is present. Nothing is ever separate; Divine Unitypermeates all things.So all the possible realities of the universe are going on simultaneously, andthe connection is via this non-local mind-stuff, the conscious intelligentintegrating aspect of all things. Conscious intelligence is the ultimateintegrator of these various realms. On one level of intellectual understanding,we may speak of various dimensions or parallel universes, but in reality, theyare all folded within each other. Looking with the \"eye of oneness,\" we see thisperfect integration via the non-locality of mind.At another level of perception, you could say that there is no connection atall. For example, you could certainly say there is no connection between ussitting here right now in Virginia and someone sitting in India. Since we're nottouching them and they are not hearing us, you could say that's correct. Onanother level, you could say, \"Well, we are all in the biosphere of earth. So weare touching the earth, and we're breathing the same air, and we are connected.\"261These are all intellectual constructs, as opposed to how they are actuallyoperating. The way they're actually operating is that the finer resonance fieldseventually give rise to the coarser ones, and there is a seamless connectionbetween them. There is a non-local connection and resonance that takes placethrough conscious intelligence.When something is teleported and goes from point A to point B in space, it ispossible because there is perfect integration between any point in space or anytwo points— or any infinite number of points in space. Due to the non-localintegration of energy, matter, space, time and dimensions via mind-stuff, everypoint in space and time has access to every other point in space and time. Andthe finer aspects of the cosmos- the astral, thought, causal, etc, areincreasingly non-local.So there is \"relative non-locality.\"Everyone thinks of non-locality as being either non-local or local. It is eitherfixed and linear, or it is non-local.In reality, there is relativity within non-locality. The architecture of thecosmos is exquisitely beautiful; at once complex and yet simple, once a fewprinciples are realized.To go from point A to B by, 'dematerializing' something and having it reappearat another point in space, you are accessing relative non-locality. The materialobject is being altered so that its spin and frequency are actually shiftinginto something approximating what the mystics would call astral or ethericenergy.And because that realm is less fixed and linear than linear material space-time,the object can appear there virtually instantaneously. This is accomplishedthrough non-local nodal resonance - where point A and point B in space areaccessed through resonance and spin via a level of the universe that is morenon-local than fixed time/space.Thus, the more you cross over into fields of resonance and frequency that arebeyond the speed of light— this crossing point of light— you access realms thatare closer and closer to the so-called etheric or astral fields of energy, whichare increasingly non-local.Now, the most perfect non-locality is pure undifferentiated Mind. And the leastnon-local is the fixed material space-time matter universe, but they are allintegrated and they are always one, and therefore if you move a material objectand alter its state electronically, it can be in an increasingly non-local form.Thus, it can be teleported from one point in space to another.It is possible to do this at the level of causation: the point of thought/sound/vibration, and that is even faster than etheric teleportation.262So there is relative speed and relative non-locality, depending on how muchfiner you're going to take any given object and put it into either the etheric,astral, or causal state that is folded within that object.An extraterrestrial vehicle, for example- or a man-made craft that actually goesfaster than the speed of light- does not speed up like you go down the highwayfrom 50 miles an hour to 60 to 70.It shifts in a quantum leap, a quantum jump, from a resonance field in what wecall, \"Stable, space-time matter material form\", to a frequency and resonancebeyond that, in one resonance jump.At that point, the spacecraft can move outside of linear vectors of space and gofrom one point in space to another, almost instantaneously— and certainly fasterthan the speed of light. But it is still not at infinite velocity.So to go from Earth to, say, many thousands of light years from here, mayactually take a few days, because you're in a form that is relatively non-local—but not perfectly non-local, such as pure consciousness.Now, a civilization that would be able to reduce the craft and everything in itto a frequency form that would be purely causal, or on a very refined astralfrequency, would be able to make that same journey in a much shorter timeinterval.A pure thought form connected to mind can go from one point in the universe tothe other truly instantaneously -- no matter how many light years. It isconnected very intimately to that perfect non-locality of infinite awareness.And so there is relativity within non-locality.We can also experience this non-technologically, in the lucid dream. In thelucid dream, we are moving, flying non-locally in our spirit or astral body,which is as real (or more so...) than our physical bodies. That is why you caneasily slip off the linear space-time coordinate and be at another point on theearth, even while you are in bed sleeping. In that state you can see what isgoing on in real-time somewhere else on Earth or in space — or slip off the timecoordinate into the future, and see something that is going to happen tomorrow,or a year from now. This is called a pre-cognitive lucid dream.So pre-cognition, or seeing something that happened in the past, or seeingremotely something happening right now, is possible because consciousness isomnipresent and we can learn to experience a finer and more subtle level ofmind, while still being in our body and individual consciousness.In a similar way, technological communication by an advanced extraterrestrialcivilization involves this paradigm. They have communication devices thatinterface with thought, and can go from a point here to a point in space amillion light years from here, instantaneously. Such a technological device isinterfacing with the pure thought itself, dropping out of the normalelectromagnetic realm into a sub-electromagnetic or finer energy realm.263But when an entire huge spacecraft is moving through the cosmos there is what Icall a co-efficient of drag from the spacecraft as it is adhering to theunderbelly of the material linear space-time universe. As it skips on theunderside of linear space-time, in the gap between finer astral and materialfrequencies, there is some drag, preventing instantaneous transport.It has to maintain a certain amount of connectivity to the material universe inorder to reemerge into it. Hence velocity is not infinite. Over short distances,such transfer through space/time would appear instantaneous, but over vastcosmic distances, there is a time and space domain involved.There are some very advanced extraterrestrial technologies that actually do notrequire this— and those are truly celestial ships. They can reside and be in avery fine celestial form, and then emerge through various levels of astralenergy and then fully materialize. Not all extraterrestrial civilization are atthe same level of integrating this cosmology into operational technologies.You know, a nickname for one of the areas out at Area 51 is \"Dreamland.\"The reason it is called Dreamland is because when they started doing experimentsmoving faster than the speed of light, and you are actually on a craft, and inthat form for any length of time, it is like a lucid dream. It's like you'reawake but it has a dream-like quality and the energy forms are somewhatplasma-like or etheric, and time is different and space are different.264"},{"pageContent":"39 GRADATIONS OF ENERGYA man who worked for many years at Lockheed Skunk Works described to me anexperience related to an astral interface with ETs. He is also one of ourwitnesses. He surfaced because he wanted me to explain something that made nosense to him and had been bothering him for years.In the 1960s, he learned how to do what's commonly called \"astral projection\" —leaving the physical body with the astral body and traveling around — whichalmost everyone has experienced if they have ever had a flying dream. He waslearning to do this consciously, in a relaxed meditative state.One night while he was practicing his technique, his teacher said, \"You're readyto do this now, and you'll be able to do it.\"So he laid down, relaxed and then suddenly left his body. He went up through theceiling of his house, out into space, and slammed into the side of anextraterrestrial vehicle that was high in the atmosphere of Earth.Now, he said that he actually rocked the spacecraft, and that the occupantscould see him.And he said, they looked at him and said telepathically \"My God, why don't youwatch where you're going?!!\" He was embarrassed at this celestial faux pas, andlater went back into his body!He said the thing that he could never understand was that he wasn't in hisphysical body, he was in his subtle astral body—but the craft that heencountered was of the same sort of density as his astral form, and he couldinteract with it. The occupants saw him, and he saw them, but it wasn't like hewas interacting with just other souls flying around. This was a spacecraft!I said, \"Well, you may not like this answer, but since you're an aerospaceengineer, I think you will understand this.\"Extraterrestrial vehicles, particularly being around earth where we're trying totarget and hit them with weapon systems, spend most of their time in adematerialzed form, resonating faster than the speed of light.265This means that they are not materialized -- they are not solid matter— but area physical material spacecraft from another planet with flesh-and-blood beingson board. If you encounter one in the dream state, they will see you, becausethey are in a form of energy where they see that level of frequency of energyvery easily, and you will see them, and you can interact with them and thespacecraft.It doesn't mean that they are angelic or non-extraterrestrial. It does mean thatthey are extraterrestrial and inter-dimensional -- if you want to use\"dimension,\" although that is not an accurate term. In reality, we are talkingabout an entire spectrum of energy and reality that is a continuum, althoughthere are certain phases to the continuum, which some would call a distinctdimension. Just like the separation of different chemicals or differentdensities of water and soil, there are striations at different frequencies.While there are gradations, they exist within a spectrum that is continuous justlike the electromagnetic spectrum from ultraviolet to infrared.This man had an out-of-body experience and he was conscious and awake in it. Itwasn't a fantasy at all. And when he had this uncontrolled launch andencountered the extraterrestrial vehicle, the craft was of a similar density ashis astral body. And yet it was still extraterrestrial, just not fullymaterialized.A human being looking with these material eyes would have neither seen him northe space ship nor the ETs— unless they had trained themselves to see the subtleenergy of what scientists call \"neutrino light\" that is emitted from the astralrealm.There are technological sensors that have been developed by scientists to pickup that kind of light, but that technology was stolen from them by the NRO andput out into space so they could detect ET craft when they are not materialized,to more easily target and destroy them.That is another whole discussion.When something is dematerialized for even a brief period, the resonancefrequency of that object has shifted into an etheric quasi-plasma form of energythat closely approximates astral energy.Now, there are different gradations within the astral realm, from a coarserastral that is interfacing with the material existence of atoms andelectromagnetic energy, all the way to the finest astral, which is called the\"high celestial,\". Every level of the astral can be interfaced technologically,if your sciences are refined enough.Entry to the finer aspects of the astral is very tightly guarded, because itrequires great enlightenment to function at that level. Such realms are guardedby evolved extraterrestrials and celestial beings, by the Godhead and by forcesway beyond anything on earth.There are extraterrestrial civilizations that are in the several hundredthousand to several million years or more technologically evolved beyond us, whoare in a266state of consciousness where the entire civilization is in cosmic consciousness,God consciousness, or unity consciousness or beyond. Their technologies arecommensurate with their level of consciousness and enable them to understand andinterface with the material universe and these finer astral and causal levels ofthe cosmos.They can appear and manifest like an extremely enlightened master who canmaterialize, dematerialize, alter form, shape, and have a presence that wouldfeel extremely enlightened.Now, not all extraterrestrial civilizations capable of inter-stellar travel areat that level of development and evolution. Some are just a little beyond whatwe have. They're peaceful and they have established global peace, or theywouldn't have been allowed to leave their planet. They would still be underquarantine.There is an order in the universe that would prevent them from leaving, justlike there is one that is preventing us from going to other star systems. Butonce you have established a peaceful existence, you begin to have more and morefreedom of movement. The technologies, and the material sciences, becomeincreasingly rooted in understanding the science of consciousness.Extremely evolved extraterrestrial civilizations manifest all of theirspacecraft and material needs through the vibratory aspect of sound, as itrelates to thought— the sound vibration of thought. In other words, thecomponent of thought that is a sound vibration. That is how you get these trulycelestial ships— they emerge from that level through the finest levels of astralenergy. The components, by the time they emerge into the material plane, areextraordinarily pure, and have within them the fullness of the light of thecelestial shining from within them.This is why some of the ships that I have been close to and seen fullymaterialized have a light not of this world. It is so pure and celestial, andyet it is fully materialized and 'solid'.I have been told by people who have studied the very advanced extraterrestrialvehicles that they are extraordinarily sophisticated -- even the crude ones areseamless. There is never a seam. How are they made?Well, they are not made by taking a chunk of iron ore or alloy and banging itcrudely into a shape! They are actually made through what I call \"infraultrasound\". The object is made by assembling and maneuvering the astral matrixto build the template of the craft at that subtle level—and it then emerges as aperfect molded form into material physical molecules.As they emerge, using this infra ultrasonic way of manufacturing, the \"etheric\"and \"astral\" energy level imbues the spaceship with intelligence. They can be sostructured technologically at a sub-atomic level, that there is organizingintelligence associated with it, and life. So they are actually intelligentbio-machines.267They are so sophisticated that they take on a level of self-integration andintelligence.People who I have interviewed who were actually present where these ET craftwere downed described these craft as acting like they were injured and weretrying to heal themselves. They had what appeared to be a circulatory system,and an immune system, and were conscious. And we are talking about the ship now!One of the craft that crashed in New Mexico had a gash in it, and the craft wastrying to heal itself. This witness said it was like when you cut yourself andthe wound heals shut —but it was a time lapsed version, healing and trying toclose right in front of his eyes.So you're dealing with a level of ultra-nanotechnology. At this level, astraland etheric energy emerges into this realm and organizes atoms and molecules.Such craft have a type of artificial intelligence associated with it, and a lifeforce associated with it, like a bio-machine.This is not your grandfather's Oldsmobile.The question is: Why would they need technology and ships at all. They don'tneed them any more than we do. Astrally, we can go anywhere we want to! But ifthey want to interface with the material universe in a way that is material,they need a material aspect. So they choose to keep it, and they utilize it.It becomes a matter of choice.They can appear at any point without a ship, without a spacecraft. But so canhumans. Humans even at this point have teleportation capabilities --unfortunately they are being used by people who shouldn't have them -- to gofrom one point or another all over the planet, without a jet, or without a shipor a car, or even an alien reproduction vehicle. This has been done withtechnologies that are being developed in classified projects.Throughout recorded history, there are reports of humans who would be in somecountry far away and would, through the operation of their own will, bilocatetheir body and materialize to visit a friend somewhere else. There are accountseven in the 20th century of this happening that are credible accounts.So if humans can do that, why can't extraterrestrials?But technological means and spacecraft are necessary if you are going to existmaterially in difficult environments - say underwater, in deep space, etc. Soeven very advanced ET peoples do have craft.Remember the story of the ET that came to the bay window in England in 1997,when Shari Adamiak found out her cancer was metastatic and I had metastaticcancer? It came out of the sky. It was lit like a star and came from a point oflight, which was a craft.268The ET arrived in a nearly astral form, but it was physically visible with theeyes of everyone. It was not a celestial perception. It was material light - andit came through the window, over to the fireplace and then, whoosh, manifestedas a scintillating luminous extraterrestrial being.These ETs are from material worlds like earth and they have biological people onthem, who are evolved enough in consciousness to develop their material sciencesso that they involve these other finer levels of the cosmology, includingconsciousness, the astral realm and the causal/thought vibration realm.They have material sciences for creating objects utilizing the understanding ofcausal thought vibration, sound vibration, and other celestial sciences. But ifthey want to be here materially, they will be here with a material craft and amaterial body. They will utilize that, even though they are in a state ofconsciousness where they can also be here in a spiritual state—even as a humancan be someplace out in space spiritually today.Humans do have the ability to be in a spiritual state and see remote places, butit is still nice to get in a car and see the Smithsonian in one's material body!Also, however, keep in mind that many of the craft that are extraterrestrialthat have beings on board have robotic bio-machine humanoids rather than actualextraterrestrial beings, for security reasons.So there is relative non-locality, and the technologies associated with theserelative states and gradations are distinct, even though they are on a continuumof reality. It is like the difference between a Model-T and nice seven seriesBMW. There is commonality and yet there are distinctions— and there are somereally marked distinctions.The exploration of the cosmos is virtually endless - and not just the threedimensional material cosmos. As civilizations evolve, they discover the astraland then finer levels that then cross over into the causal— which also havecoarser and finer levels. The numbers of degrees of gradations are virtuallyinfinite - and each has its own applications, technologies, sciences and thelike.My experience is that there is a highly organized inter-planetary andinter-species group that directs and plans anything that would have to do withextraterrestrial civilizations inter-facing with an emerging world such as ourown. It is highly ordered; it is not space anarchy!Even at our stage of evolution, we have at least a semblance of internationalcooperation and organization for international air travel and things of thissort.There is a highly functional inter-planetary diplomatic operation that controlsand coordinates interaction with Earth, and it has been operative for a verylong time -- certainly since before recorded human history.269Humans have attained, in individual instances, the highest level of evolutionpossible- as high as any in creation.But collectively, there is a great deal to be desired. The potential with- inhumanity is equal to the potential within any species in the universe. Ourcapacity to evolve into very highly conscious enlightened individuals with aconcomitant social structure is equal to any civilization that has ever existedor will ever exist in the universe. That we are not there yet only means thatour journey is not complete.This is why I think life on earth— and humanity specifically— is very cherishedand greatly loved and is being nurtured, observed and protected. There is greatanticipation that we will soon grow up and quit clubbing ourselves in the head,like a bunch of crazy cavemen, and begin to live in a civilized fashion.And indeed this is the time when that will happen, and peace will be firmlyestablished permanently. And by permanently, I mean for hundreds of thousand ofyears, in an unbroken period of peace and growing enlightenment.This era is a universal cycle. And this universal cycle has ramifications forearth and other planets as well. Indeed, there may be planets that are at asimilar level of development as ours or even less technologically developed thanours.But know this: The cycle we are in is one of universal peace on earth and inheaven—on earth and throughout the cosmos. We live in the time of the greatestpotential - and the greatest challenges...Humans should not be down on ourselves— in terms of our capacity. We are notinferior, nor are we superior, to any other intelligent species in the universe.We are absolutely equal, because within us, as within them, the universe isfolded. The universal concept, \"man,\" has equal potential for completeenlightenment and the realization of the existence of the Infinite and all ofits applications and wondrous sciences, within each intelligent being.Extraterrestrial civilizations that are here, I am sure, have very specificpurposes and functions. One of them is to be able to interact with humans thatare peaceful towards them and are willing to interact openly with them. This iswhy the CE-5 initiative has met with so much success. Any effort to contact ETspeacefully is greatly respected. Because let's face it, out of the six billionpeople on earth, there aren't that many people who know about this, and ofthose, there are a very few number who are actually willing to do anythingproactive and positive to contact them. It is time for humanity to make peacefulcontact.270"},{"pageContent":"40 INTER-STELLAR COMMUNITYYou really can't understand the nature of the future unless you understand thenature of reality. As we talk about the future, we can only talk about probablefutures. The details may shift and time lines may shift, but the meta-themes areknown. This is most important.If we understand the blueprint of the new world that has already been created inthe Empyrean realm, we can see the patterns of the next several millennia onEarth. The oak tree is always within the seed. And if you can perceive what's inthe seed and understand it, you can then see all the stages of the maturation ofthe oak tree as it grows for hundreds of years.And yet all of this is tempered by the existence of \"probable futures,\" becauseof the operation of free will by humans on earth in intersecting the larger Planthat exists. Everything that everyone collectively is doing is affecting thetiming and the specific expression of this era. We are over a hundred years intoa time when we could have already had universal peace, the elimination ofpoverty, free energy, anti-gravity travel and even been out in space,peacefully, amongst the stars. But we are not there because of themisapplication of free will, and ignorance.People who say that they are psychics and firmly say, \"X, Y and Z are going tohappen on this date,\" they are almost always wrong. They are either self-deludedor just charlatans: there are just too many variables because of the interactionbetween the overarching divine plan and its descent and manifestation, which hasto occur through people. This process can be either assisted or obstructedthrough the operation of free will.There is a specific plan that has already been laid out -- a blueprint orarchitecture of the future. What I want to do now is describe the blueprint ofthis beautiful structure that is being built.Perhaps right now only some of the foundation and cornerstones are being laid,but if we can understand what the divine Architect has laid down in thisblueprint, we can get a very good sense of what the overall will look like.271The big theme is one of increasing levels of oneness and integration on everylevel of existence. An era of at least 500,000 years of human peace andfulfillment has opened - and we are witnesses to its early light.We will see the complete agreement between the spiritual realm and science.The full elucidation of these wondrous sciences and their applications tobenefit the entire planet will assure a time of unbroken abundance and peace.These sciences, used for peaceful purposes, will create a civilization that willwitness an end to material poverty— and with that will come a permanentfoundation for a just and lasting peace.Only then will we be suitable members of an inter-stellar community of people.The current state of affairs will change because it must. But it won't be easy.Easy would have been 100 to 150 years ago. But we have missed that window.Through our own perversity and rebellion, and our refusal to do what was right,we have now reached this millennium without yet having established peace,without having turned the swords into plowshares.Hence, the transition is going to be either difficult or genuinely catastrophic.I say this very frankly. I have no illusions about it, nor should you.And yet, no effort in this regard is wasted, even though at times we may bedemoralized, and even at times we may see nothing but despair and despondency.In reality, everything is still possible, and everything is in play.While it is important not to ignore the risks of the present era, what isessential is that we have our sights clearly fixed on that far horizon— theinevitable civilization that will be established on earth, and that we are hereto help create. We must keep moving forward, and doing the right thing andspeaking the truth. Even though some people may not like the truth they hear, itneeds to be told.In one of my lucid dreams as a teen, I was up in the sky floating, as if in aUFO. I found myself in a part of the world where I had never been, and it wasthe west coast of America. I was hovering over the LA basin, and I saw thebuildings of downtown Los Angeles. The buildings that I saw weren't there atthat time but all of them are there now. The Bonaventure Center was the big one—it wasn't there then but it is there now.It looked like daytime and there were enormous changes occurring on the earth.Suddenly, there was a tsunami coming in from the Pacific.If you can visualize the Bonaventure Center being about an inch in height, thistsumani was two to three inches high -- so two to three times the height of thetallest buildings in LA.This tsunami came in and completely swept across the LA basin. And yet, as thiswas happening, I felt a strange calmness. I felt no fear at all. I was justlooking as if a movie was being shown of events that could happen if we didn'tchange our course.272 Now, this dream happened around 1970 -- there wasn't a lot of talk about globalwarming and the fact that we could have a sudden environmental collapse.In the dream, I could see that there were enormous geophysical changes andenvironmental changes that were happening. And they led to some event that wassudden and catastrophic.Then, as the dream proceeded, I looked around and as far as I could see, the skywas filled with thousands of extraterrestrial vehicles. They were involved insome kind of assistance effort.We are in a time now where the chance of serious and sudden environmental eventsis growing.There exist within covert programs 'scalar' weapon systems that could triggerenormous earthquakes and earth changes like this.There is no question that these projects are deliberately, with maliceaforethought, withholding those earth-saving energy technologies that couldprevent the melting of the polar ice caps, and other catastrophic changes in theenvironment.So whether it is through an extraordinary and covert technology or through theconsequences of our social and industrial stupidity, we are now at a time whereeven mainstream science and the Pentagon are putting out warnings of suddenclimatic and environmental changes.I am not saying this at all to cause any panic— that is why up until now I'venever spoken publicly about these things. But we are at the point where we needto know that this is one possible future that is unfortunately becoming moreprobable,.Subsequently, I had a recurring dream where I am shown a color-coded global map,and the colors went from blue to yellow to orange to red. And blue areas wereregions that had less catastrophic geophysical effect, with yellow, more, orangequite a bit of damage and red catastrophic. The red areas were regions ofmassive destruction or loss of entire landmasses.The entire continent of Australia was red, as were many other areas in Asia. Thearea that was most blue was an area that was in the upper mid west, and highplains of the United States, extending into Canada. The most orange and red wereall coastal areas, and particularly the Pacific ring of fire.In parts of Europe, particularly going up through the Pyrenees and parts of theAlps, I saw all the gas pipelines exploding, and with them all the villages, asthe earth changed, and the earth's crust was cracking.Entire land masses were gone, and others emerged or came up from the oceans.This happened not over thousands of years, but pretty much overnight.273In another lucid dream, I saw the earth spin and tilt out of its normal axis sothat the sun seemed to stay in one place, , and the stars were moving in a verystrange way, once night came. The climatic changes were enormous, and there werephalanxes of tornadic storms sweeping across from the Rockies to theAppalachians across the central part of the United States.Most of the major cities were either in utter chaos or destroyed.In the event of a significant change -- and this has evolved since the nuclearera - the government has a system, called the Continuity of Government plan, orCOG. There are underground facilities here in Virginia, for example, where thereis a continuously operating parallel government.I have a very close friend, who served in one of those positions, so that if thegovernment of the United States had been wiped out by some event- nuclear ormassive environmental- he would have stepped into the position of one of thecabinet secretaries, and he was operating in this facility. There is actuallymore than one facility. There is the old one, at Mt. Weather, VA and there'sactually another state of the art one that is not far from our home.The idea is that there would be people left to govern, but it would be verydifficult, and there would be mass chaos.In another lucid dream, I saw that an asteroid was coming from space; it hadmade its way through because we had forced the ETs to shrink behind the crossingpoint of light.One of the asteroids hit, and then there was another one that was coming, and weknew it was going to be much bigger. We were talking to people via short waveradio and learned that there was no electrification in all of North America orEurope.The first one that hit was so strong that every piece of infrastructure— meaningevery bridge and every roadway— had collapsed west of the Mississippi. CONUS --the continental United States command— was mobilizing the military, moving west,trying to build temporary bridges and setting up operations to assist people.But the one that was still coming was going to be several orders of magnitudestronger than that one, and we were just sitting waiting for it.In some areas the atmosphere appeared to be ignited, and everything underneaththe area was burned.After this had happened, there were still people on the earth who were living ina brief dark age. I couldn't tell if it was for months or years, but I got thefeeling it was between a few months and seven years.Then, I was out in space again, looking at the earth and saw a light emerge --it was both a spiritual light and an electrical light, and it was emanating fromthe274area of Norway or Scandinavia. It was very specific. The time frame was towardsthe end of the last century and the early part of the 21st century. There wasnothing more specific.I also remember back in the early '70s, seeing headlines of papers written inhuge letters describing events that had happened— some of which have actuallycome to pass, like 9/11, but others that have not yet happened. And it wasalmost like a newsreel. It sounds ridiculous, but it was in living color, veryrealistic, and these headlines were marching through time, over a period of manyyears.Now, time is not fixed. Time is relative and so is space. And all these thingscan happen or not happen depending on what we do.There are some things that we have already avoided, and other things we haven't.Everything is in play.We have to understand the nature of the interplay between what individual humansdo, what large powerful institutions are doing, what the collective actions ofhumans create, and what the divine plan is. There are certain inevitable thingsthat are going to happen because we are not going to be allowed to destroyMother Earth in one feckless, blind generation. Earth is intended to be here forthe evolution of intelligent life for hundreds of thousands of years.She loves us and is very patient, but that patience has limits -- and if we donot change, the earth will cast off her burden.Well, cast off how? Like a dog shaking fleas off if need be. Literally shaking.It all depends on whether we're willing to consciously and willingly use ourfree will to lift the burden and change the way we're doing things.So none of these things are absolutely inevitable. They may be likely. And it isbecoming more likely, because we have refused to do the things that common senseand wisdom would require.Unfortunately, the current status quo of increasing warfare, covert actions, andruthlessness in enforcing secrecy is the antithesis of the direction we shouldbe going in, and therefore does not augur well for an easy resolution of thecurrent conundrum.There are things that humans are doing that can help or harm, and there arethings that extraterrestrials will do to help. They're certainly not here toharm. If they wanted to harm, it would be all over by now. Every individual hassome role to play in how this is all going to end up. And this is why it is socomplex.The Chernobyl event actually could have been much worse. Recently, people havesurfaced with photographs of ET craft above Chernobyl that are thought to havehelped stabilize and prevent some of the worst sequel from happening.I am sharing these things with some trepidation, because people are going totake them and say, \"Dr. Greer said this is absolutely going to happen.\"275That is not what I am saying. I am saying these are possible to probable- someare very likely events. And yet, collectively, as people, we can affect thatoutcome if we so choose to. It is never too late.The question is: Has this happened before?Yes. We have passed this way before. You know, there are the legends ofAtlantis, and there are the stories of Lemuria, and Mu, in the Pacific. It istrue there have been entire continents and civilizations at or beyond the levelof where we are technologically for which there are virtually no traces. Whattraces there are have been suppressed, because it flies in the face of orthodoxscience, orthodox archeology, orthodox anthropology and orthodox religion.Remember, fanaticism consists of redoubling your efforts when you have forgottenyour goal. The goal of truth has been forgotten by many people, whetherscientific or religious. Therefore information does not make it out to thepublic because those in control are guided by lust for power, control dramas,false belief systems and corruption.The difference is that during the last cycle, which was 400-and-some thousandyears, civilizations disappeared and long periods of time transpired beforehuman society regrouped. In this new cycle, no matter how dark it may get, thedawn has already occurred. The new day has already been established. And thenext half a million years will be marked by the fact that there will be no lossof continuity of civilization once we make this transition. I am qualifying:Once we make this transition.There will be an unbroken progressive civilization for hundreds of thousands ofyears. There will not be a rise and fall of various civilizations that becomesomewhat enlightened and then sink back into ignorance and warfare and anotherstone age.Since Earth has been in her orbit, there is nothing in the past history of Earththat equates to this time. That is how incredibly beautiful it is.So don't be overwhelmed by the chaos and the madness that is around us. I amonly sharing these things to indicate that there are some possible futures thatare rather worrisome and that may be imminent— the exact timing of which couldbe anywhere from this moment to the next decade or two.If we are wise, we may avoid the worst of these things.In one of my experiences, I was on board an extraterrestrial vehicle, lookingdown into Mexico. I saw a massive volcano, Popo, which is the fourth largestvolcano in the world, and a severely dangerous one.When I first started going there, I told people, \"This is going to get more andmore active,\" and shortly after that, it started erupting more frequently.276And people asked, \"How did you know that?\"I explained that all these ET craft are going in and out of it, trying tostabilize it, and are investigating it, because it is a very unstable part ofthe Pacific ring of fire. During these Earth changing events, I saw thousandsand thousands of luminous oval-shaped objects that were glowing from within,coming out from under the ground, all over that part of Mexico and around thevolcano. They were floating upwards, like bubbles coming up from the bottom ofthe ocean, going up to the surface. Envision thousands of them going up, incolumns, into the sky and fanning out. It was beautiful.The population of the earth, as I saw it, was greatly reduced. It was a fractionof what it is today -- how small a fraction, I don't know. And those who wereleft here had learned an extraordinary lesson.The lesson will be learned. The question is how serious must events get forpeople on this planet to learn that lesson.Up to now, neither World War I nor World War II nor Hiroshima nor9/11 nor thespecter of environmental collapse have changed the perversity of our collectivebehavior.But no matter what happens, on the far side of these changes, whether they arethis severe or something less severe, those left will have learned a seriouslesson, and quite frankly will be chastened and will vow to put down the meansof war, and will use these wondrous new sciences and technologies, permanently,only for peaceful purposes. That lesson will be learned never to have to belearned again; so deeply will the lesson be ingrained in the psyche of all theinhabitants of the earth.Now, we could learn that lesson without going through such a traumatic change,except humans tend to be very stubborn and very refractory to enlightened changeunless we are compelled to make that change.We have chosen so far not to take the lesser events to heart and make thechanges, and therefore as the native American peoples would say, \"We are in thetime of changes,\" and the time of what they call \"the great purification.\".These events I am describing will be not only manmade chaos and catastrophe, butnatural catastrophic events. They will purify the minds and hearts of menthrough the fire of these tests so that they will vow never to do thedestructive things we have been doing. We will learn not to blow each other upbecause of a difference in religion or a difference in race or a difference inideology or what have you -- all the silly nonsense that have been the bane ofhuman civilizations for thousands of years. We will retire that thinking, and itwill be a permanent change.Then, Phoenix-like, out of the ashes, we will quickly reconstitute an advancedcivilization on this planet that will be permanently peaceful.277We will have the ability to apply all these wondrous technologies that arealready on the planet. Everything that is needed has been vouchsafed to thehuman race and is here. Everything that's needed for the next half a millionyears is actually already here. That is the really good news.278"},{"pageContent":"41 PHASE TRANSITIONAn analogy from quantum physics a concept called phase transition—is usefulhere.If you take a container of helium and cool it down to absolute zero, it beginsto boil and agitate very violently Chaos and disorder increase even as some ofthe molecules begin to align coherently At the point that only about one percent-- not 99 percent, but about 1 percent- of the molecules within the containerbecome coherently aligned, the entire field, all of the molecules reach a stateof coherence -- super-fluidity is actually what it is called.Helium then takes on these magical properties; it behaves very differently andthe entire field of molecules is coherent. But just prior to that moment ofextraordinary coherence is the point when it is most chaotic and most violent.We are right now at that phase transition moment in the history of the humanrace. It is going to get more chaotic and seemingly more disordered. But what weneed to see are those islands of coherence that are developing. We must becomethese islands of coherence and vision. And when enough of humanity has, a phasetransition will happen and the field of human society will quickly transform.So what is that good future going to look like? Luckily, the Architect has leftus a beautiful blueprint, and all of us have that folded within us, and we cansee it, if we choose to gaze with a steady vision.We must learn to be seers, because to the extent we see it and understand, wewill be vehicles for manifesting and creating this vision.Humans are still going to be humans, but the excesses of violence and wars willhave ended.The great wars and the tremendous difficulties will be a thing of the past.Initially there will be a period of peace that is tenuous—with certain rabiddogs firmly chained. This political peace will precede widespread higher statesof consciousness and enlightenment amongst the majority of the population.Ultimately, the only way to insure behavior that is not damaging to others isenlightenment.279That is why peace and enlightenment go together.In the early decades after the phase transition, civilization on earth will bereformed, rebuilt, and transformed around peaceful, non-violent pursuits. Mindnumbing and debasing poverty and illness is not a milieu in which significantnumbers of people can grow and become enlightened.As we reestablish civilization with these new technologies, over the nexthundred years or so, there will be a permanent peace, the elimination of povertyand growing abundance on Earth. As these technologies are applied for peacefulpurposes, and every nation and people on Earth have vowed to absolutely crushany attempt to weaponize them, we will see a flowering of humanity unlikeanytime in Earth's history.Every village and every community will have the means to create pollution freeenergy that is unlimited for manufacturing, clean water, transportation, theability to grow organic natural food, etc.Imagine: You can be anywhere in the world, and have all you need, at very littlecost. With no cost for energy, you could have all the light and controlledtemperature you want in any climate, and grow any type of food needed, undercomputerized, automated conditions. This technology exists today. There will beabundant food of the highest quality without petrochemicals, fertilizers andpesticides for everyone. If you look at foods today, their growth, and theirdelivery, is an enormously petrochemical heavy process. So free energy is thekey.The earth, being two-thirds covered with water, has plenty of water, if you candesalinate it. Well, you can't desalinate it unless you have the energy systemsto do it. When energy is free and abundant, this will be possible.Manufacturing will be abundant, clean, and very inexpensive. The biggest expenserelated to the total cost of manufacturing anything we have is the energy thatgoes into acquiring the raw material, transporting it, fabricating it, packagingit and shipping it to you.It is mostly energy related. What happens when the energy component of thatbecomes zero? It is a whole new world of abundance and pollution-freesustain-ability in harmony with nature.Because of these advances technologically, the work week will shrink to between15 and 25 hours, mostly out of choice, and the rest of people's time will bespent in the pursuit of creativity, recreation, learning and other positivepursuits.The economics of the transformative effect of these technologies will be suchthat there will be no need to work 40-60 hours a week; in fact, doing so wouldbe socially harmful.280People will then be able to discover their Dharma, their calling, for what theycan contribute that is most consonant with their God-given skills and theirinnate capabilities and talent, as opposed to a survival level of subsistenceout of necessity.Thus, a civilization where people can pursue higher states of consciousness andenlightenment, will at last be possible.The era of big urban-suburban areas will be over. Earth will be a globe ofvillages.Why?Because if you can go from Phoenix to Paris in three or four minutes, there willbe no need to aggregate in these very dense, sprawling cities. Some people willchoose to live in larger communities, but there will be no economic necessityfor huge metropolises. Transport will be rapid, above ground and efficient,using ARV technologies.Such travel above ground with anti-gravity systems will allow for the mostremote places on earth to be fully inhabitable, with little environmentalimpact.In one lucid dream, I saw that the latitude of where Chicago is now will besubtropical with palm trees. What is now the Arctic and Canada, will be verylivable and a comfortable climate.The climate of the earth will be much warmer overall. But remember, it is likelylarge-scale geophysical changes will have occurred.With these new free energy technologies, 100 percent recycling will be feasible,including for water. Water can be trapped and recycled, rather than beingspoiled and just dumped into waterways and the ground.I am speaking now of technologies which are extant, not ones that have to beinvented.I remember Archibald MacLeish saying back in the '70s that we already had thetechnologies to scrub to zero effluent every bit of manufacturing pollution. Butthe amount of energy that it would take to scrub all pollution out, given thefact that we're using fossil fuels to create the energy, quickly reaches a pointof diminishing returns.Now, I am talking about the early decades of the first hundred or couple ofhundred years. Looking beyond that, the sciences I alluded to in the cosmologywill allow for the manifestation of any item or any commodity out of the fabricof space around us.That technology actually exists already. So what material need would there bethat couldn't be met?There isn't one. And this is the big message. There would be no material needunmet. And in that state, the human condition can begin to blossom from one ofneed and fear to a state of repose, and move on to higher spiritual pursuits.281Also, shelter will be altered tremendously. Think about the fact that if youhave anti-gravity capabilities, building materials can be moved into place justlike the pyramids were built. You can have buildings that are made out ofwhatever materials are least harmful to the earth. Technologies would exist sothat many of the chemicals that are used now won't be necessary. Heating andcooling, since the energy is free, would not require structures that arechemically toxic and sealed up in unhealthy ways.Housing will actually be much less expensive and the means to build them will beradically altered because of these technologies.The architecture of these buildings will be very different. One of the things Iwant to do as soon as we acquire an operational over-unity, free energy deviceis to build a demonstration house in the high desert of Colorado in Crestone,where it gets 20 below in the winter, but gets 80-90 degrees with blazing sun inthe summer.When you look at the ancient peoples, you see they lived together closely invillages, preserving the surrounding land for agriculture, recreation or justbeing natural. Humans, being social animals, will choose to live in suchvillages in the future, in a way that is high-tech self-sufficient.Today, we live in a way that is like a metastatic cancer: an urban city, with ahideous sprawl of McMansions and cookie cutter suburbs.Psychologically, people are happier if they are living in a more intensivevillage setting, with neighbors and friends and the ability to walk or bike tocommercial and social venues.Right now, we are gobbling up all the natural beauty and paving it over, turningit into strip malls, McMansions and suburbs.Right now we have to build so that the house or building is wired. But thefuture of manufacturing will be that everything that needs power will have afree energy source within it. There will be no need to have wiring in a house;everything will be wireless.Thus, the cost and complexity of building will be greatly reduced. Constructionwill be simpler, cleaner, and more natural -- less expensive, and morebeautiful.So this is how we will rebuild the earth, with this consciousness and these newtechnologies. On that foundation, a civilization that is at peace and abundant,and where humans are freed to pursue more enlightened activity will thrive. Itwill be a totally altered economic order, manufacturing structure, andindustrial structure. In the aftermath of all this change, there will be asingle global currency; there will be national boundaries, but they will be lessand less important.In medicine, most of the problems that we're struggling with now are lifestylerelated. How one eats, lives and exercises determines at least 90 percent ofyour health. Genetics are important, but even given those parameters, how onelives is very determinative.282Having a physical body, there will always be things that happen -- whether it isfrom genetics or from accident, or choosing a bad diet.These advanced electromagnetic technologies can be configured as sophisticatedelectromagnetic healing and diagnostic systems.In classified projects, technologies exist that would enable people tocompletely regenerate limbs or an injured spinal cord. Those exist now. But ifthey let them out, they would also let out the secret of these free energysystems, because it is the same basic area of physics. But in the future, whenthis new physics is known, we will also have a new medicine.Diseases that appear now to be incurable, ranging from cancer to AIDS to otherinfectious diseases— even severe injuries— will be curable.Right now, we live in a very corrupt world where the decision as to whether ornot something is told to the public is part of a large medibusiness system. Ithas more to do with whether a 100-million dollar drug company investment willget an adequate pay-off or not. It has very little to do with health - or thetruth.It has to do with money and the abuse of power.Scientific healing will be vastly more evolved than what we have today, becausewe will add to it the knowledge of these new electromagnetic systems andsciences that have been kept secret.Right now, in the United States we spend an enormous amount of money on amedical system that is very ineffective for many of the conditions and diseasesthat people confront. That will change. In the future, medicine will be bothhigh-tech and more holistic- at the same time.The natural genetic encoded life span of a human being is around 120 years. Inthe future, people will be living very healthy lives up to 110, 115, 120 years.There is a time to be born, there is a time to live, and there is a time to letgo, and drop the body.There is no need to live forever in a physical body. Life on Earth is precious-but so is life in the astral worlds of light.Once we understand the beauty of the afterlife, we will be less anxious aboutleaving this one.Even in this regard, I think medicine will change. We spend an enormouspercentage of our health care funding on the last 60 days of life, often doinginhumane things to stave off the inevitable. In the future, more emphasis willbe on having a good life- and a good death, at home, in peace, surrounded byloved ones, not machines.283There is a certain spiritual grace and wisdom to knowing when to let go and moveon.I believe this spiritual wisdom, will parallel the medical sciences.So we will optimize the natural lifespan of humans, meaning a high quality oflife will exist into old age.Right now, we compartmentalize science and spirituality, when really a skilledphysician should also be a very spiritual being. We will have people who areskilled in the healing arts, who are also spiritually aware and will be able tohelp people make this transition when it is inevitable.The passage from this material plain into the worlds of light and consciousnesswill be very much like what Shari had. It is beautiful. Each person who passesto the other side should have the spiritual assistance so that he or she ascendsto the highest level possible- according to their own state of consciousness andlife-path.As genuine spirituality grows, the desperate clinging to the last few seconds oflife, at enormous expense and suffering, will change to a more compassionatetransition. The more we become materialistic and less spiritual, the more webecome neurotically unable to enjoy either life or its passing.In the future, this level of abundance will allow us to optimize not onlymedicine and healing but also the education of every child. We will learn how totruly educate, and it will begin at an early age. Certain meditative andspiritual techniques unlock enormous potential and will be taught at 4-6 yearsof age.Over time, there will be an enormous growth in the mean IQ, which is now notoptimized at all.In the undeveloped world, poverty and malnutrition greatly stunts the mental andphysical growth of children. With the elimination of poverty - impossiblewithout these new technologies- the minds of these children will also blossom.In the developed and developing world, there is much chemical and toxicpoisoning -- heavy metals, lead paint, air pollution. These will also beeliminated.Divorce rates are over 50 percent. The majority of children in some minoritygroups have no fathers in the home.This is truly a spiritual problem in my opinion. I think that people will beginto view family differently, as an eternal commitment. (People may say that Isound like a very conservative person in this regard. It is not a conservativevs liberal issue. It is looking at it from a spiritual point of view).When people decide to bring children into this world, that should be a permanentcommitment. Every child should be a planned and wanted child. So we will haveuniversally available birth control, and couples will have children when theyare ready for the spiritual, material and social responsibility to care foranother human soul. I think this will become an increasingly common value.284Now, I will also say that I think it will be increasingly common that people areloving and tolerant of situations that don't work out so there will be anextended sense of support around people and their children when bad things dohappen -- if they are orphaned, or if they split up.And while I don't think it should be forbidden to divorce, it will be very rare.The selfishness involved will diminish, because selfishness is usually whatdrives these problems. The focus should be on the welfare, love and rearing ofthe children.People will learn to find mates that they are maturely connected to and thenreally commit- and then have children. Children should have the parents andextended family to support them and provide the love and the discipline needed.Every child will be seen as a sacred trust, to protect, nurture and raisetowards enlightenment.Right now, we do not have a culture that values that—and we certainly don't havea social and economic order that even facilitates it, because of themind-numbing poverty and the disintegration of families.Once you have joined and brought a child into this world, whether you know it(or like it!) or not, an eternal bond is created. Even after you pass on to theother world, you are with your family and you will have your children near you,and grandchildren and great grandchildren. There is an unbroken line and thoseindividual souls -- they are part of creation -- go on eternally, through allthe states of evolution and enlightenment. People will grow in theirunderstanding of what an extraordinary event it is to bring a soul into thisworld, to create a conscious life.Once people understand that, they will also understand the sacred obligation ofit, and have the patience to work through life's difficulties.I am a big advocate of people acknowledging and being tolerant of people who aregay and lesbian, because I'm quite certain it is a natural variant of humanexistence which is present at the time of birth. The kind of wholesale bigotrythat is attached to gender and sexuality will be a thing of the past. It isalready, unless you are part of the immoral minority who really do believe gays,lesbians and feminists caused 9/11! The moral questions of our day have nothingto do with those issues whatsoever; it is a distraction from the real moralquestions that should concern us.285"},{"pageContent":"42 UNIVERSAL SPIRITUALITYEven if you forget about the question of global warming, the environment, andthe geopolitical consequences of having oil wars, the suffering that takes placein the world today because of artificial poverty resulting from the withholdingof these technologies has caused hundreds of millions of deaths. This covertpolicy has forced billions of people to live in desperation and ignorance,without education or the basic means of a dignified life.That suffering alone would justify a change in the current order and adisclosure of these technologies and wonderful new sciences. Because while mostpeople worry about what kind of terrible cataclysms might befall usenvironmentally economically and geo-politically if we continue on our course,most of the world's population is already living in the hell of poverty anddesperation. For them, it is already a catastrophe — right now.Consider this: Since before we started the Eisenhower Interstate System, we havenot needed an interstate system. In the future, all transportation betweencities will be above ground, through anti-gravity magnetic systems, and thehundreds of billions of dollars spent on maintaining and building surface roadswill be freed for education, health and other useful purposes.Moreover, the enormous amount of prime real estate and arable land that is nowsitting underneath all of that concrete will be available for agriculture orrecreation.The resources that we now spend on energy, fuel systems, transportation, andsurface roads will be used for real progress for human civilization. We alsospend over a trillion dollars a year on military-industrial operations —anenormous part of world economic activity. Most of those resources will becomeavailable for other purposes.So it is not as if the resources or the money isn't there to create anextraordinary planet. It has just all been misdirected and squandered.Once that dynamic changes, whatever you can imagine will be possible!286All the technologies are here already. We have the knowledge to do it. And thereare enough wise people on this planet to do it. So why hasn't it happened?The structures and institutions around religion today are going to be greatlytransformed and for the most part, swept away. Remember that the evolution of apriesthood -- rabbis, priests, reverends, mullahs, etc— occurred because veryfew people could read.But in a time of universal education, there will be no illiteracy. Even today,most of the people can read and write. Thus, the need to have a centralizedpriesthood will end. This need is actually over already— we haven't needed itfor 150 years.In the near future, every person will arise to the responsibility ofindependently seeking the truth, reading, studying, meditating and praying fortheir own spiritual development. There will be spiritual teachers, but notpeople who are elevated to the point of being \"the reverend,\" or \"the rabbi\" or\"the Imam,\" of for that matter \"the Dalai Lama.\"These religious structures have served a good purpose in the past, at times, buthave been co-opted by men for the abuse of power and to amass power and control.This dynamic has nothing to do with the purpose of any religion on earth -- anyreligion -- or any of the founders of any religion on earth.If one wants to identify as a Christian or Jew or Buddhist or what have you,that will be fine. But the clergy will be replaced by lay-people, sharing.Societies will evolve around seeking spiritual truth and experiencing spiritualreality, and looking to the teachings of the entire knowledge of spiritualteachers -- of all the spiritual teachers. They will assemble in counsels andassemblies where there will be no central priest or reverend in that community,but they will rotate or take turns and share as a group.Certainly people of greater capacity or experience might teach or share withothers. This will always be the case. We will always have teachers. But the ideathat there will be a paid professional priesthood: The time for that is over. Itis over because it has been abused, and because humans have the capacity now toread, and to investigate truth on their own. It is actually very corrupting tohave some other person interpret for you the meaning of truth; we can share ourtruth with one another, but ultimately we make the truth our own, in our ownway. It is spiritually infantilizing to have a priest do those things for you --there is an abdication of our spiritual responsibility for ourselves that goesalong with that kind of relationship. People need to take spiritualresponsibility for their own evolution. Now, this doesn't mean that there won'tbe spiritual communities or spiritual organizations or religions. But they willbe greatly changed, because if they are genuinely pursuing enlightenment andspirituality -as opposed to amassing power and controlling people- they will belooking to empower everyone spiritually.287This area of human life will focus on the experience of spiritual evolution andthe genuine understanding of the divine and the sacred.The things that today pass as big \"religious issues,\" will be changed andrefocused to the actual purpose that all of the great prophets, Avatars andspiritual teachers came here to give us: the knowledge of the existence of adivine Being, and the ability for people to pray to and meditate within thisdivinity and realize that in their lives.The corruption of religion is intimately related to both the masses giving uptheir spiritual power and a priesthood that is prone to abusing power.And no matter how many fine people there may be in the priesthood, there arealways those who go into a demagogic mode— who can then affect weaker minds andbring them under their control, whether it is Jim Jones or someone who is tryingto induce a jihad or inquisition.This kind of fanaticism and thinking will be exposed for what it is, andretired, just like the thinking about nationalities or ideologies requiringmassive warfare and destruction will be retired. And it will be retiredpermanently.Transformed, truth-seeking religious groups will have a deep and abiding respectfor others. People will discover as time goes on that truth is one - and thereligious differences are unimportant or based on falsehood, misinterpretationsor perversions of the original spiritual teachings.We will eventually evolve a universal spirituality. People are simply not goingto be able to hold on to the chauvinism of this sect versus that sect if theyare awake. Because if they are awake, they are going to realize that there isreally no difference at all -- that the Light is the same in every lantern nomatter what the lantern may have been externally: whether it was Buddha orKrishna or Christ or Mohammed or any other Manifestation of Divinity. Peoplewill start searching for that Light, and they are not going to be separated byhatred and divisions due to the form of the lantern.My understanding of what happens at the time of the separation of the spiritbody and soul from the physical body, what people call death, is that there is aseamless continuity of awareness. This is what I experienced and this is what Ialso know from other people who have had a near-death experience. There is acontinuity of your individuality— you have all your memories, all yourknowledge. But you are suddenly freed. It is like a bird leaving a cage. Thevast cosmos that is the astral realm, the worlds of lights and beyond, is yournew home. You ascend to a level that is commensurate with the state of yourevolution and consciousness reached on earth. And you openly consort with lovedones and friends that you have connected with on earth.288In that spirit form, you continue to grow and evolve through every level of thecosmology, into greater and greater realization of the astral worlds. One cansay it is heaven, these beautiful worlds of knowledge and light. You continue onthat path forever, until you choose, from enlightenment, to merge with theOcean. And yet 'you' always exist; time is an illusion. The drop of yourindividuality can merge with the ocean of the unbounded Divine Mind, and yet youcan also continue as an individual, with work in that realm.The individuality that is this unique creation, that is you, does not getdestroyed. The awake Being within every thing is a singularity, and always hasbeen, and always will be. But your individual soul exists eternally as well. Weare all part of what God created. Our individual awareness will continue untilsuch time as the drop is joined with the ocean— and you choose, by choice, toremain there, or not.There is a beautiful continuity that takes place. Your children, your lovedones, your ancestors, your parents -- you will see them. You will know them. Andthey will welcome you.You will see others and will associate with those souls that are at a level ofcapacity and knowledge and consciousness that you have reached.One of the key things to remember at the moment of passing: \"Forget all that youhave known. Let go, and go into that most great Light.\"We don't have any idea how high a station we may reach at that moment, but I cantell you this: The best possible outcome requires being as detached as possiblefrom everything you know, everything you have done, everything you think youare, and allow yourself to just completely be immersed in that most great light,that divine light.What holds people back as they transition from this plane to the next, are theirattachments, whether it be material, egotistical or what they think they know.So the condition of detachment and purity, and the willingness to completely putone's self into that divine light, takes you to the highest possible state ofexistence.What is the difference between achieving those states after death and achievingGod consciousness, unity consciousness, in a meditative state in this life?It depends on the level of consciousness you attain here. It is possible to haveexperiences and be in a state even on earth that is as high and as extraordinaryas anything that can be attained through billions of years of evolution afteryou leave your body.On the other hand, for most people, being freed from the body, there is enormousjoy, freedom, bliss and new abilities that appear. Within one's own mind, onecan manifest everything -- just as you can now visualize a castle -- that castleis real in that realm.There are no limitations whatsoever.289Now, of course, there are people who have been on this planet who can seesomething and actually manifest it. While this is unusual, it has happened. Butin the astral and causal realm of thought, this is easily done.Now, the flip side of that is because of the condition of having the physicalbody, and the suffering that's attached to it, one is propelled to more quicklyattain states of spiritual freedom and enlightenment. Being on earth createsopportunities for rapid evolution. This is why life on earth is precious. Theability to reach enlightenment and to attain very high states of consciousness,and to grow as a soul, is much more concentrated on earth than any other phaseof existence.That is the mystery of the material universe. That is why there is the materialuniverse. That is why there is the physical body. And that is why there is thesuffering attendant thereto.Being in the body creates an enormous opportunity to evolve into extraordinarystates fairly quickly.Now, \"quickly\" means time and time is relative, and when you get into the astralworld, time is totally different.When you are on the other side and you are in that state, it is so beautiful andpeaceful, that the search for the infinite home, and the need to find thatsolace, is not nearly as great as it is in a physical body. Here, there is adaily opportunity for suffering. In a sense, being in a physical body opens tous the superhighway of spiritual evolution - if we chose it!So the mystery of suffering and sacrifice is very intimately related tospiritual development and the ability to go to great heights of enlightenmentwhile on earth. Now, one can go through an entire life of being in a body andnever take that opportunity. But still there are lessons to be learned.Earth is one great big schoolhouse, and there are lessons to be learned anddifferent levels of those lessons. We can avail ourselves of them only if wechose to.This means that we can go from being in a state of the physical body, and if wehave the knowledge and spiritual experience, go to extraordinarily high astralor finer celestial astral levels of existence, or even directly beyond that intothe causal realms of pure knowledge—or even completely to the unbounded Being.Most people choose to be in phases that are in the next step beyond where we are-- from the material world into the astral and etheric -- just because there'smore familiarity: there is form. They are more comfortable. It is beautiful.There's tremendous freedom. But eventually, we all pass into a knowledge evenbeyond that level.But, if one understands the cosmology and has experienced them on this plane, itis possible to experience the full range of evolution at the time of one'spassing.290This is why taking the opportunity to learn about and experience the finerlevels of spiritual development is very important - because then, when you leaveyour body, your ability to advance through the divine worlds is greatlyfacilitated.One might ask, \"Well then, what is a ghost?\"A ghost is someone who has left his body, but still has such strong attachmentsto this plane, that they are 'adhering' closely to some place or person onearth.Once, while in the emergency department, we had a terrible trauma case with anintoxicated person who died a violent death. Later that night, when the ER wasempty, I was sitting at the center station with the nurses. All of a sudden, inthe trauma room where this person had expired, the EKG machine turned on byitself, and the cabinets at the back of the room opened and IV bags and suppliesbegin to fly out!It was a classic poltergeist. We all knew it was this person, who was able toeffect these events through the astral/mental/emotional interface with thematerial plane. If you understand the cosmology described earlier, you willunderstand the physics of poltergeist.This angry, confused person was obviously upset and in a rage. So I turned tothe divine presence, saw that soul and connected him to Godhead; asked him toleave and ushered him out with some of his cohorts on the other side. And heleft.Now, people ask, \"Well, what would be the state of that soul?\"You can't predict that. The evolution of someone who passes from this life tothe next is assisted by the intervention of those in a more enlightened state onthe other side as well as those still on earth.This is why praying for the spiritual advancement and enlightenment of those whohave passed away is very important.It is said that there are three primary ways to evolve in these other statesafter death: First, through the prayer of others here on earth, second, throughthe intercession of the enlightened ones on the other side, and third, throughdoing good deeds here on earth in the name of those who have passed away.In the future, as I have seen it, this will be routine knowledge, and whenpeople pass to the other side, they will have gathered around them people whowill be completely devoted to God and to connecting them to this other state,enabling them to reach the highest possible gradations of the celestial worldand enlightenment.The hell that people speak of are those lower aspects of the astral realm, lowermeaning coarser. People of similar proclivities and behaviors, of commonenergies, coalesce together. Of course, if they leave behind all that they havedone, ask forgiveness and let go of everything they have done, turning to thepure, divine Being, such beings can advance.291All can be transcended in an instant, if any given soul truly submits todivinity, and let's go of what he has done, asks for absolution and forgivenessand turns to that most great Light.Ultimately, you cannot judge the station of anyone else. Thus, \"Judge not, lestyou be judged.\"We should see every soul as educable, as capable of enlightenment. At the momentof death, with one's last breath, someone who has lived a rather difficult andat times destructive life could let go of all that they have done and all thatthey have seen and turn to that most great Light, and ascend to a very highstate.Therefore, one should not judge.At the same time, people who have regarded themselves, or been regarded byothers, as having been very righteous and spiritual, at the moment of death havebeen filled with so much pride and egotism that they create a huge veil betweenthem and the most great Light. So at the time of death we need humility, acertain grace and the spiritual assistance of others.292"},{"pageContent":"43 ACCESSING CONSCIOUSNESSWe confuse the map for the place.I can give you a map of Washington D.C., but it is not the place that isWashington D.C. Everything is folded within us. Now, we are looking outside withour physical bodies, but in reality, the nature of mind, the consciousnesswithin us, that whereby we are awake, is omnipresent, and crosses through spaceand time, and every gradation of the cosmology This means that you are not'going anywhere' when you astrally project, because you are already everywhere.You are already omnipresent it is the nature of mind. But your individuality,playing on itself, can perceive it as a gateway or journey.Now, in a very powerful experience, the body can be altered to the extent thatit dematerializes. It can shift and disappear and be etheric or at the astrallevel of existence- and then reappear. We have seen entire ET craft shift intothe astral form of energy. Remember on Blanca Peak, as I went into this area oflight, my body became somewhat rarefied, and I thought at one point I mightactually lift up. Other people could see that I partly disappeared from certainangles, and could see right through me.The physical body and the physical world has very close, intimate connections tothe consciousness that is within us. The holographic quantum universe, throughthe integrating function of conscious intelligence, connects every point inspace and time, and every level and dimension and gradation of the cosmologywith every other point.The perception of distance and separation on one level of perception isaccurate. On another, it fades away into non-locality.So you can access what people call other \"realms,\" by virtue of accessingconsciousness in a more non-local manner. Sometimes peoples have achieved thisthrough chanting, singing, meditating, etc. Such exercises may allow the mind tobecome steady, and transcend the limitations of the fixed perception of thematerial three-dimensional world to see what is beyond.293Certain people are able to see spirit beings or the auras of people, or to lookat a plant and sense what it might be used for in healing.These are all gifts that are folded within us, depending on the degree to whichwe develop them.Within the drop, the entire ocean can be discerned. So within each of us- thisdrop- the totality of the ocean is teeming.Creation never ends. At the time that two people join, and the unique reality ofthe genetics of two people form a new person -- encoded within the new geneticsis the potential for this new being, this new soul.Creation is always being created within itself. The unbounded being is alwayscreating more conscious intelligent life.There is no lack of space! The universe is infinite. So there is no limitationto the number of beings and souls that can exist. And each one has the totalityof conscious mind within it, and each will eventually realize this divinity, andbecome a drop returning to the ocean.From this primal soul and primal, most great light, all that could be created ispresent. And so the potential for all that can be created, has been created, andwill be created, has always been present, at that level of the cosmology.When a new person is created, it is realized from that divine matrix that hasalways been there.There is a state of consciousness you can reach where you can be gathered withthe divine Being in the presence of all who have ever been, all who are, and allwho will ever be.I experienced this state seven days before Shari passed away. I heard atrillion, trillion, trillion beautiful voices singing, \"We are all one inspirit\". Every being in its perfect causal idea form emanating from the creatorwas present. It was stunningly beautiful. It was one of the most beautifulexperiences of my life.So from God have we come and unto God will we return... Each life brought intothis world— or any other world— has always been part of creation.The unbounded Mind emanating through the operation of its own will, manifeststhe pure causal thought in its sound form, from which the entire universe thenemanates.Sound is more elemental than form or light, and precedes it. This is whyhumming, chanting, mantras, prayer, thought -- repeated thoughts— are sopowerful as vehicles for transcendence.Each and every created thing has its own tone, has its own sound vibrationwithin it, that then gives shape to the astral form of it, which serves as thetemplate for the material object itself.294Can you see that? If you experience that on a certain level of consciousnessthen, using the sound component of thought, you can move things, manifestthings, and affect the material world.In the future, we will learn to manufacture by assembling elements from thesedeeper or finer levels. By operating on the level of sound and thought, we canassemble the astral form and bring it into the full material three-dimensionalworld.Sanskrit is an ancient language which is the root of all Indo-Europeanlanguages. In that tradition, the Vedas, they talk about name and form.What they are referring to is the sound vibration of objects, which gives riseto its form. People trained in certain techniques can, in fact, go into a stateof consciousness and through sound and thought vibration, bring into reality anitem -- whether it is an apple or a ring or any other object.There is a level of the cosmology where the seed form of all knowledge islocated. You can receive knowledge from this level of consciousness, dependingon your own proclivity and interest.A very close military confidante told me that a technology was invented a longtime ago, apparently in the '60s or '70s, that allows them to extractintelligence, events or conversations from what they call the \"white noise\" ofspace. Using an advanced electronic system developed at White Oaks Navalfacility in Maryland, everything that had ever been said or done at a givenplace could be extracted. The technologies that have been developed in theultra-black world are truly astounding.Every point in space and time is an entry point to any other point in space andtime. Encoded within any given point in space, everything that's ever happenedthere leaves a signature, an essence, that can be seen. The true Akashic recordis within the structure of conscious intelligence, and therefore is everywhereand can be accessed anywhere.In the American west, I have actually heard and seen the ancient native peopleswho lived there. I have heard the drums and something like a tambourine sound,and chanting. It is like a movie that is always running there, once you tuneinto that frequency.Everything we are saying and doing throughout our whole lives is always,permanently encoded -- like crystalline rock, but it's on the level ofconsciousness and spirit.295"},{"pageContent":"44 A CELESTIAL QUALITYWithin this great cycle that has opened, we find that there are hundreds ofsmaller cycles. After around another thousand years, there will be anotheraugmentation of the larger cycle, with another Avatar. And after that, anotherin a thousand years or so.These Manifestations of Divinity will potentiate the capabilities within mankindto fully realize our destiny and establish the golden era on earth. This time ofpeace reaches far beyond a political peace or a material peace. This will be thetime of genuine enlightenment and the establishment of God consciousness ingreater and greater numbers of people. Even as we live on earth in bodies, wewill have the fullness of the realization of divinity within us.The major theme for the next several hundred thousand years will be theestablishment of a divine civilization- - a civilization that is on earth in astate of spiritual enlightenment. Whereas in this day, there may be a few peopleat any given time in a society that are enlightened, by the end of this cycle,every man, woman, and child on earth — and every child that comes into thisworld- will be in that state.In fact, the children being born in this world, will already be born in a highstate of consciousness. But now I am speaking many thousands of years from now.It will not take long for humanity to reach the peace of the 'chained dogs' - apolitical peace. Abundance, the end of poverty and the reforming of the earthinto a sustainable civilization will quickly follow.But the process of humans living on this planet in a state ofenlightenment-where that is the common experience and the great aspiration—isthe major theme of the next half a million years.Everyone asks, \"Well, after that, what else would there be to accomplish?'\"There is so much. All the wondrous worlds -- all the fine celestial realms-willbe opened up to the knowledge of people, even as they dwell on the earth.And the earth will become one of the great jewels in the crown of the entirecosmos. This is the destiny of earth and the destiny of humanity.296Imagine for a moment: eventually we will have technology-assisted consciousness,and consciousness-assisted technologies. The sciences that we now see asmaterial, will be understood as sciences that are fully integrated into theknowledge of consciousness. This includes healing, transportation, energygeneration, manufacturing, biology, agriculture— all of these areas will have acomponent involving the science of consciousness.These sciences of consciousness will potentiate material technologies andsciences. We will see that every endeavor is an opening for practicing theknowledge of conscious awareness. And in that there will be great joy andwonderful discoveries.The early stages of peace on earth will be paralleled by early, open contactwith extraterrestrial civilizations. It will be commonly known that we're notalone and that we have never been alone. The true history of humanity, includingthe cycles and millennia where there had been advanced civilizations on Earththat have vanished, will become openly known.This early relationship with extraterrestrial civilization will be based inpeace, not conflict in space. We will openly exchange ambassadors with otherpeoples in the universe.The sciences that are extraterrestrial in origin, that deal with biomachines,artificial intelligence, non-locality of matter and mind, communication usingconsciousness-assisted technologies across vast distances of space— these willbegin to be accepted and understood by more and more scientists and leaders.The masses of humanity will realize that these extraterrestrial people andhumanity share a common oneness in spirit, in pure Mind, and that the sciencesemanating from the knowledge of consciousness will begin to be shared openlywith humans. We will begin to go into space and explore other worlds with otherextraterrestrial civilizations -- first with those with whom we can relate mosteasily. We will evolve organically as a space-faring people; it will not be allat once.There is a threshold we must first cross: universal peace.There will be hundreds of milestones and gradations of relationship that arewholly dependent on the level of evolution of consciousness on earth. To theextent that there is a greater and greater level of the evolution ofconsciousness and the establishment of enlightenment, to that extent we will beable to interface with civilizations at that level.There will always be people on every planet that are pioneers who lead in thosestates of consciousness. Eventually, the whole of society evolves in thatdirection. Humanity will evolve as an entire species into higher states ofconsciousness; we will then interface with other worlds that are in the state ofcosmic awareness.297And there will be interplanetary cultural and technological exchange. The earthwill develop as an extraordinary and beautiful culture, and will become a cosmicculture. While the first thousand years of this new era have the hallmark ofpeace and a highly abundant world civilization, the later millennia to followwill have as their hallmark a growing cosmic culture. Eventually, we will evolveadequately to share the benefit of our wisdom with other worlds. They will learnthat we have passed that way before, even as these older ET civilizations havewho are visiting us today. And just as we are being visited today bycivilizations that have established peaceful worlds, we will be emissaries andguardians of civilizations that are also crossing into maturity.Even the material objects made by our society will be of such high quality thatthey will have their own consciousness associated with it. It will be likelooking at a beautiful piece of art or a beautiful sunset: Everything will havea celestial quality to it, even if it is a material item, so beautiful will bethe craftsmanship and design.We will develop technologies that have their own life and consciousness. Anintelligent, conscious quality will exist in almost everything that we make --even if it is something that today we view as 'inanimate'.We will see that nothing is really inanimate -- that there is no such thing asanything that isn't living, that is devoid of a life-force and consciousintelligence within it. Everything has life, everything is life, and everythingis awake -- every rock, every mineral, every atom, every photon.This will be realized and not just an intellectualization, and will haveprofound implications for the material sciences.Cities will evolve into celestial appearing structures, with a light of theirown. Everything will have a special life-energy and consciousness within it. Andas we go thousands of years into the future, the earth will become a beautifulbiosphere with human civilization manifesting a divine, celestial quality inevery aspect of life.The human body will reflect the inner state we are achieving. We will attain alevel of perfection where diseases and illnesses simply do not exist through thecourse of one's life span. Illness will be very rare. And then when the time hascome for one to move on to the next stage, that will be a choice, and we willleave the body consciously.At the end of this 500,000 year cycle, every aspect of life on earth becomesdivine. Extraterrestrial peoples, angelic and celestial beings, humans— all willbe perceived and interacting together.The world we live in today, where a very heavy veil blocks humans from theperception of these other worlds, will be transformed to a world of celestialperception and knowledge.298In the future, we will not need to cling to ignorance to feel safe. We will nothide in our ignorance. We will not find comfort any longer in being blind, butwe will be free and rejoice in seeing. We will welcome not only theextraterrestrial beings, and travel amongst the stars, but will also see thecelestial beings, and commune with them openly.We see an era where every being on earth has attained this state of celestialperception and consciousness, and a moment will come when the entirety of ourcivilization will choose to create a world. We will create a spacecraft thatwill be of such a form and celestial texture that the craft and everyone onboard will be in a state of God consciousness.And being in that state, we will travel throughout the cosmos as a civilization,teaching other civilizations in an unbroken chain of God-conscious, evolvedpeople.Some of what we are witnessing today is showing us our future. Those who haveseen the extremely evolved extraterrestrial civilizations that, while material,are firmly established in divine consciousness have caught a glimmer of thehuman future.As we move from earth into the cosmos as a people, completely established inthis divine state of God consciousness, we will become a dynamic force of anexample where they will be some day— even as today there are civilizationsshowing us where we will be in the future.And so this beautiful cycle continues, and is never broken.Can you see that time? That is the destiny of the human race. It is celestial.It is divine. We will become \"extraterrestrials\", in a state of cosmicconsciousness.299"},{"pageContent":"THE GENERATION OF TRANSFORMATIONHalf a million years is actually not very long. It seems like an enormous amountof time. But time will be perceived rather differently once people understandthat life is eternal. As we gaze through this time and reflect on the currentsituation, we see a poignant sweetness to how primitive we are. And yet, we seewithin us the potential for a future where the earth will be inhabited byenlightened beings that are our descendants.All of us, by then, will have passed on to the other world. But we will be theleaven that raises up this world, and all the generations after us. We areeternally connected to earth and her people and her children. We will continueto guide and nurture this vision and this knowledge amongst the people of theearth until the earth reaches the culmination of its development in its goldenage.Never be discouraged by this transient time of chaos. Keep your sight fixed onthat far horizon— knowing the far horizon is not really that far. For it isalready here, folded within us...So we should not worry if in the coming days or years or few decades there isdifficulty and darkness and chaos. Because this vision that we are seeing isalready assured. No matter what anyone tries to do, the Divine plan and thedestiny of earth and humanity will be fulfilled. This reality exists already.Forget about time for a moment. Forget about the amount of time. See that on adeep level of creation that this plan for humanity exists— for universal peace,abundance, the abolition of ignorance, the end of disease, and the growth ofenlightenment in every person on the planet. Earth will itself be a beautifulspace ship floating through the cosmos. On one level of linear time, all thesewondrous worlds await us; but in reality it's already here. You can see it; youcan feel it.We are, in a sense, the children of the half-light. The light is there - butit's only half there, hidden in all the current darkness. But \"God loves thosewho work together\". We can join with people and spend time with people who sharethis vision and are working in some way to fulfill this good future.We have to be aware of the chaos, but we should not only focus on that. It'seasy to dwell on the negative. But there is so much that's beautiful that's allaround us and there's so much that's happening that's positive. We candiscipline ourselves to dwell on that which is good and beautiful and draw thatto us and bring it into the world. It isn't easy, because we live in a worldthat's increasingly harsh and destructive. But this propels us all the more toconnect firmly to truth and to a deeper vision.We must have the courage to choose enlightenment, and take responsibility forour own evolution and the progress of humanity.We live in the most interesting of times. We're the last generation that willfully have the experience of both the old world and the new era. We're too closeto it to really see it, but we have a beautiful station that is pivotal. It isunlike any generation before or that will come after. We are the generation oftransformation. It is at once overwhelming and beautiful. We should be joyousand amazed at the extraordinary time we are in and the unparalleledopportunities we have.Efforts expended through the difficulty of this time, for this purpose- for theestablishment of universal peace- will be honored and remembered for thousandsof years. If we seize the opportunity, we are providing a service to humanitythat no other generation could provide— and that's why we're here."},{"pageContent":"THE GROUP MEDITATION: CONTACTING ET BEINGSLet us sit here together in silence, centered within our own selves. Let usclose our eyes and take some deep cleansing breaths, from this sacred andancient place. As we breathe in, see that we are centering, and ourconsciousness is expanding. As we exhale, become very relaxed, and release allnegativity, tension and fears, and feel yourself settling into a deep peace. Webreathe in light and life, and the expansion of mind, while fully expanding ourlungs, and as we exhale, we release all things, all attachments, and becomeperfectly centered, and at peace.As we sit here together in silence, we watch our breath, as it goes in and out,and we see that we are centered in a vast ocean of silent consciousness.Gently, without straining, allow yourself to see the awake-ness that is watchingthe breath. Observe that you are awake, and that this awakeness is silent.Now, see that this awake mind, which is still and steady, is observing all thesounds, the thoughts, the feelings, all perceptions, and yet the mind itself isquiet.Dive deeply into this vast ocean of quiet awareness. Going more deeply now, seethat all the perceptions are receding, becoming more distant, and quiet, and youare being established more deeply, in this ocean of awake-ness within.You see that it is easy to simply be awake and perceive awake-ness itself --neither pushing away other perceptions, nor straining to know awake-ness. Weeffortlessly, simply are awake and are aware of that mind that is conscious andquiet within us.Now, settle more deeply into this ocean of quiet awareness, where allperceptions are like distant ripples on the surface of the ocean. And youperceive that this vast awake mind extends infinitely in all directions. And yousee that this awake-ness is omnipresent. It is not bound by space or time. Andso it is infinite, and it is eternal. This is the true nature of the awake-nesswhereby we perceive our own breath, our own self, sight, sounds, thoughts. Wefeel the joy and peace of knowing that this awake Being, this Mind is everpresent within us.Now, releasing ourselves from all attachment to perception or even self, we seethe unbounded quality of this awake-ness as universal. And every person in thiscircle is awake, and while we are unique individuals, the light of awareness isa singularity, and that awake-ness is one, and we are one being in many bodies,one light one illuminating every soul and conscious mind.We see this same vast awake-ness permeating the earth beneath us and expandinginto the sky above us. Omnipresent, it is awake in all places. And soaring onthe wings of this vast and limitless awareness, we expand upwards into the sky,and we see that the entire earth is shining in the light of this awake-ness, andbeyond us, space, and the planets of our solar system, all spinning, swimming,in an ocean of awake mind.This simple awake mind within us is the same awake mind that permeates allthings, which is omnipresent, omniscient, and eternal.As we expand further into the vastness of space, we see the entire solar system,with the beautiful blue earth now an orb before us, and we see that she isconscious, and is her own individual being, and she is awake, with the samelight of awareness whereby we are conscious, whereby we have awareness.The sun, and all the planets, each have their own conscious identification andare all unique beings. And yet the awake-ness within them, within every atom,within every photon, permeating the space of our solar system is the same awakemind that is within us.As we expand further, we go beyond our solar system, and we soar through theentire Milky Way galaxy, and expand through the vastness of 100,000 light yearsof space and beyond the outer edge of the Milky Way into inter-galactic space,and we behold the beautiful spiral galaxy of our Milky Way, and we see that itis awake, pure consciousness shining, phasing as stars and planets and aninfinite number of awake beings.Gazing then beyond the space of our Milky Way galaxy, we behold inter-galacticspace, and we see stretching in all directions an infinite and endless cosmoswith billions of galaxies, each with billions of star systems, and planetsteeming with intelligent life.Now effortlessly, we dive into this vast cosmic awareness, and find the infinitepeace, an infinite, endless awareness permeating the entire creation, and webehold that this cosmic mind, this omnipresent awareness, is always indivisibleand is the same awake-ness whereby we are conscious here and now and always.Being thus awake, we now perceive that the universe, which is itself endless,has advanced extraterrestrial life forms, and all are awake even as we areconscious. And through this connection, we are one. We know that there is oneconscious Being, shining, standing, within all life. And through that, weconnect to them. As we gaze across the cosmos, through the galaxies, within theMilky Way, within our solar system, around the earth, we allow ourselves to seeany extraterrestrial people with their beautiful celestial spacecraft.And as we see them, we ask permission to gaze within, and as we see thesebeings, we invite them to join us here on earth as we join together as peoplecelebrating the time of universal peace and the establishment of an enlightenedcivilization on earth.As we see each of these beings, we see that they are connected to aninterplanetary council— highly evolved spiritual and ambassadorial in nature. Weinvite them to join us here as we show them our galaxy. And as we zoom in evermore closely to our solar system, we show them this beautiful planet Earth, thethird planet from our star, the sun.As we connect to their minds and to their guidance system, we show them ourexact location. As we come zooming in more closely, we show them this field withour circle, and we invite them here, at this time and place, in a spirit ofuniversal peace, acknowledging our oneness with them through the universal awakeBeing within us, this cosmic Mind, shared by all beings.Now, as we see these beings, aware of us, and in our mind's eye, we see them, weask that they join us at this time in a meditation and a prayer, for Earth andfor its transition to the time of its destiny as a place of peace andenlightenment.Let us take each other's hands as we do this. As we connect with each other, wesee that there are extraterrestrial beings, celestial beings, the greatProphets, and the enlightened ones, all joining with us. And we send from personto person, around this circle, counterclockwise, a golden light in our consciousawareness, a beautiful astral light empowered with oneness, peace and love. Andas this light goes from left to right, making a beautiful circle, it becomes aring of light.In our minds, we empower it with tremendous energy, and we send it upwards as acolumn of light rising from this spot, going into space as a beacon, carryingwith it the love of Earth, the oneness we share, and the time of peace that weare establishing.This beacon is calling to all beings, joining with us in peace. And we see itconnecting to every world, every star, every heart, and every life. It spreadsout and diffuses throughout the cosmos, this beautiful golden light.And so, too, we see this light extending into the ground and across the earthbeneath us. And this light of peace and oneness and love, suffuses the earth inthis light, and every heart is illumined, and every mind awakened and every darkplace is filled with light.In this state of illumination, we ask the great Being, to give peace to theEarth, to turn every selfish heart into an open fountain of love and generosity.And wherever there is hatred and enmity, we see peace being established. Andwherever there is greed, we see altruism and generosity. And wherever we seeseparation and sadness, we see the joy of oneness and love.As we do this, we see the cosmos and all enlightened beings, material, celestialand divine joining with us, pouring forth this vision, and the Earth coming toits time of peace, and the chaos ending.Now stretching before us, we see thousands of generations of humans livingtogether in peace on the earth with wondrous new technologies and sciences thatenable us to be in harmony with the Earth. And with abundance we banish alldisease and poverty, and all injustice and all want.On the foundation of this peace and prosperity, we see the hearts of allhumanity turning to the pursuit of enlightenment. And in this state we arewelcomed into the vast regions of the stars, and we become an inter-stellarspecies, and are welcomed into the family of planetary societies.As we gaze down through the ages, we ask the great Being at this moment to setus forth in the direction of enlightenment. And in that instant, we see the timewhere every man, woman, and child abiding on earth, is in a state of cosmicawareness, of God consciousness. The divine sciences and enlightenment prevail.We ask the great Spirit that we may be channels, vehicles, tools, for theestablishment of this peace and the entry of humanity into enlightenment.We see that we are joined by beings celestial, extraterrestrial, and divine, andthat we are not alone and we have never been alone. And we ask that this GreatBeing enable us to all work together in the establishment of universal peace anda universal civilization.This we leave as our cherished gift to our children, and our children'schildren. And we are certain that this beautiful vision is already manifest,that the Creator has already given to us the knowledge, the sciences, and thewisdom to create this world and to manifest this reality. And we consecrate ourlives to the establishment of this divine civilization.Namaste."}]
