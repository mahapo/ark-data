They are mentioned in ancientMesopotamian writings, as well as in the contexts of esotericism and fringescience. They also feature in the volatile topic of the New World Order as itrelates to politics and global issues. It is astonishing—at least for those whohave not dealt with the hidden history of our world—to discover how all thesethings interweave. But who are the Anunnaki? Do they really exist? What sourcestell us anything about them? Is there a planet Nibiru?SITCHIN, TELLINGER, AND PARKSThe subject gained attention through the books of Zecharia Sitchin (1920–2010),who set forth the theory that the Anunnaki are visitors to our Earth from aplanet named Nibiru. Sitchin’s books and hypotheses met with much interest butwere criticized by scientists and skeptics. He was reproached for giving too fewreferences to sources for his interpretations of Mesopotamian texts. It was alsoclaimed that his linguistic interpretations were amateurish. It is true that hissource references are much too few, and the question about his linguisticqualifications may be justified. Nevertheless, his theses are remarkable, evenif they are only partially correct (though these may be essential parts). (As akind of response to repeated questions about sources, Sitchin published The LostBook of Enki in 2004. It gives the impression of a real Mesopotamian documentbut raises more questions since no source at all is stated, and some have,therefore, assumed it to be a construction.)Michael Tellinger carries Sitchin’s theses further in his interesting book SlaveSpecies of the Gods, and he corroborates them with his own investigations andcomparisons with various cultures. In my view, however, Tellinger relies toouncritically on Sitchin’s writings, especially The Lost Book of Enki. Hisopinions about Jesus and Christ as agents of the Anunnaki derive from a layman’sview of ecclesiastical Christianity. If he had engaged more critically in thehistory of Christianity and especially of Gnostic Christianity, he could nothave written as he did. As a result, his claims about Jesus are erroneous. As Iwill show here, Jesus was a messenger of Christ and had the mission of informingus about the rule of the Anunnaki: that was why he was killed. This mission wascarried on by the Gnostic Christians until they too were eliminated by theruling powers. Another problem with Tellinger’s text is that it lacks directreferences to sources: there is only a general bibliography.Later, another writer joined the discussion. The French-German author AntonParks published some books in French, of which Eden: La vérité sur nos origines(Eden: The truth about our origins) is the most important. Parks translatesMesopotamian texts quite differently from previous linguists and ethnologists.Although the result is an interesting contribution to the subject, it containssome surprisingly erroneous linguistic references to Hebrew concepts. Moreover,as I will explain later, some of his assertions can be questioned. Again, sourcereferences are sparse, especially concerning Mesopotamian texts. He cites onlycoded notations for cuneiform texts, making it difficult to compare histranslations with others.SO WHO ARE THEY?Why are they called Anunnaki? This word means the people of Anu, and it firstappeared in Mesopotamia on cuneiform clay tablets that are several thousandyears old. In this book, I will retell and discuss the story of the Anunnakiaccording to these tablets. This is done from more of a spiritual viewpoint, incontrast to the common, and rather dry, scientific attitude, which is based on alimited worldview.The traditional approach to creation myths is to regard them as such—asmyths—but we will consider them under the hypothesis that they may have afactual background. What does this hypothesis mean for our monotheisticreligions, and what worldview will that lead to? Moreover, what connectionscould there be with actual occurrences in our world?I will try to give answers that will probably not appeal immediately to allreaders, depending on their worldviews, but at any rate will offer material fordiscussion and reflection. My intention is to span a bridge between, on the onehand, the common “scientific” views on this subject, and, on the other hand, thenumerous esoteric books and ideas, which have their defects as well. The latterin many cases lack a proper grounding in the clay tablets and other ancienttexts, and sometimes provide isolated quotations that do not stand up toverification.image [images/9781591433040_003.jpg]A first millennium Mesopotamian cylinder seal impression. This image—in theconventional interpretation—shows a worshipper and a fish-garbed sage, with astylized tree and a crescent moon and winged disk above it. To the left is thedragon of Marduk, with Marduk’s spear and Nabu’s standard on its back. Some ofthese elements will be discussed later in this text.ARE THERE REALLY EXTRATERRESTRIALS?The widespread opinion that the Anunnaki belonged to an extraterrestrial raceis, of course, taboo in circles that consider themselves scientific. Yet if westudy the Mesopotamian texts, we will not find contradictions to thisinterpretation: it is logically possible. It merely conflicts with thepresent-day official worldview and the customary dogmatism found in “scientific”circles.Today it should be clear that we cannot possibly be alone in the universe.Mainstream astronomy now estimates that there are trillions of planets in thecosmos, and the probability that only one of them has biological life is almostzero. Since there are probably hundreds of thousands of populated planets, it isalso probable that other civilizations are out there.ORIGINS OF RELIGIONSThe present treatise is based on research into the history of religions andlooks ahead in connection with spiritual and esoteric sources. Unlike theabove-mentioned works, it cites a large number of sources that can be found inrelevant books and on the internet. I will avoid attempting a scientifictransliteration of words from non-European languages.*1[9781591433040_ftn.xhtml#fr1] Please note also that I will not distinguishstrictly among the various cultures in question but will for the most part usethe general term Mesopotamian. As for the many links to the internet that arecited, a number of them will no longer be available after some time, because theURLs will change or the websites will no longer be active. I hope that theinterested reader will be able to find corresponding websites with the help ofthe information that is given.image [images/9781591433040_007.jpg]I would also like to express my thanks to Jennie Marx of Inner Traditions/Bear &Company for her suggestions and helpful editing of the text."},{"pageContent":"1THE ANUNNAKI AND THE CREATION OF HUMANITYFacts about Us in the Mesopotamian Clay TabletsThe ancient Mesopotamian cultures consisted of Sumer (3500–1800 BCE), Akkad(2340–2125 BCE), Babylonia (2000–1000 BCE), and Assyria (1170–612 BCE). (Theseare all approximate dates and vary somewhat from one source to another.)These civilizations left a large number of texts in cuneiform writing on claytablets. Many of these have been preserved to this day, even though some aredamaged or broken; others have no doubt been stolen and are now in privatepossession or kept at unknown locations. Regrettably, some have even appeared tobe used as building material for houses. It was only in the nineteenth centurythat these texts could gradually be deciphered and the valuable clay-tabletliterature became accessible. With this, a worldview appeared that hadpreviously been unknown in modern times.Among the most important texts in our context is the Babylonian creation storyEnuma Elish (so called after its first two words, which mean “when above”),written on seven tablets, which gives some information about the creation ofhumans.1 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt1] I will briefly describe this creationstory, referring to various translations (which differ in part, in some casesextensively). A much older description is published in another of my books, Esbegann in Babylon (It began in Babylonia).2 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt2] Thisbook was published in 2008; today I would have written much of it quitedifferently.Early scholars dated the Enuma Elish to about 2000 BCE. Some more recent authorswant to date it some one thousand years later. A more accurate dating remainsuncertain.Official science regards these stories as tales and mythologies without anycorrespondence to the actual cosmos. Because there are remarkable parallels tothe first books in the Old Testament, especially Genesis, one would logicallyhave to also regard the latter as pure mythology (as some actually do). As aresult, I will write using the equally admissible hypothesis that theMesopotamian stories may also be based upon actual truths.The Enuma Elish tells us that the Goddess Tiamat was the primordial mother ofthe race of the gods.*2 [9781591433040_ftn.xhtml#fr2]Their primordial father wasApsu, her male partner. Out of their union a kind of personified power ofcreation emerged, called Mummu. They mixed their energies, and three generationsof gods came to be. The first of these was the divine pair Lahmu and Lahamu, outof which emerged Anshar and Kishar. A third generation followed: the one of theheavenly god Anu, with two female mates, and their sons Enlil (“lord of thestorm”) and Enki (“lord of the Earth,” also called Ea or Nudimmud), who also hadtheir female companions. Out of them, a race of gods then emerged, calledAnunnaki or Anunna.image [images/9781591433040_004.jpg]Enlil, Lord of the Stormimage [images/9781591433040_005.jpg]A detail from the Adda Seal showing Enki, center, with streams of water and fishflowing from his shoulders.After they had emerged, the divine brothers, Enlil and Enki, and the otherAnunnaki disturbed Apsu and Tiamat with their behavior. Although Apsu could notpacify them, Tiamat was tolerant at first. Then Apsu called his counselor orvizier, Mummu. They went to Tiamat to get her advice. They actually wanted toexterminate these divine brothers, or rather reverse their creation. Tiamat wasinfuriated, because she was their primal mother, and she wanted to disciplinethem benevolently. Mummu, however, advised Apsu to continue with theextermination, and Apsu was pleased.We will have to understand Apsu in two ways. In one aspect, he is the primordialenergy out of which the creation came to be, but in another aspect he is alsothat energy as a personified entity. Tiamat is often characterized as anotherprimordial energy but can also be understood as an entity representing thefemale (birthgiving) part of an androgynous aspect of one Creator.*3[9781591433040_ftn.xhtml#fr3] These entities are often devalued when it does notfit the common worldview to see them as Gods.Enki discovered their plans and thwarted them. Using spells, he put Apsu andMummu to sleep, stripped Apsu of the signs of his power, and killed him. Mummuwas fettered. Enki had won and established a world “on Apsu” to which he gavethe Creator’s name—meaning that he built his own world on the basis of thealready existing creation. Thus Enki hijacked a part of the primordial energy.The sphere of life and power of Enki was now called Apsu. Here the god Marduk,the wisest of the wise, was born of Enki and his female partner Damkina (alsocalled Damgalnuna). This god, who had four eyes and four ears, was to become thedestroyer of Tiamat, and he molested her day and night with “waves,” alsotranslated as streams, wild surf, or flood waves (and, improbably, in one Germantranslation as “reed swamp,” which can hardly reflect the energetic nature ofthe attack).Some of the gods now have evil plans. They accuse Tiamat of passivity andchallenge her to fight. Tiamat prepares herself. The gods split: some supportMarduk, and some take the side of Tiamat, who had previously given birth tothem. Tiamat produces invincible weapons such as monstrous snakes, with sharpteeth and bodies filled with poison, for her defense in the comingconfrontation. She manifests cruel but godlike dragons, who raise fear at themere sight of them. A horde of monsters is assembled—a hydra dragon, a demon(also called Lahamu), a rabid dog, a lion man, a scorpion man, tempest demons,and so on. Eleven kinds of monsters arise, and Tiamat’s firstborn Kingu(“laborer”) becomes their leader as well as Tiamat’s new spouse. In this, we maysee a separation of the originally unified energies of Apsu and Tiamat.Enki finds out about these preparations and feels afraid. He informs Anshar, whois also greatly disturbed, and asks Enki to appease Tiamat. Since Enki hasalready killed Apsu, Anshar wants him to kill Kingu also. He is aware ofTiamat’s strength and asks him to send another against her. Anshar then turns toAnu, who first wants to negotiate with Tiamat but then shrinks back as a resultof her preparedness to fight. The Anunnaki—the people of Anu—are alarmed. Enkinow calls Marduk to his chamber and orders him to fight, and he accepts the taskwith bellicosity.Marduk approaches Tiamat, with all of his assisting gods marching at his side.Tiamat roars vehemently, and Marduk accuses her of having caused conflict inarrogance and pride and of having aroused discord through conspiracy. Sons wouldhave done injustice to their fathers because of her influence, and she wouldhave groundlessly hated her own children. She would have sought evil. Mardukturns the tables. He challenges her to a fight that ends with her death.Now it is obviously impossible that Marduk and his cohort could have killed theprimordial Creators and destroyed all the cosmos therewith: it would have meantsuicide for themselves. Therefore the true meaning is that they turned theirback on the Creators and declared them as dead to the Anunnaki: the latter wouldlive as if the Creators no longer existed. In that way, they made a separateregion in the universe for themselves, a kind of enclave in which they lived asif they were alone. Hence—if we are to assume a basic reality behind the storyrather than regarding it as only a myth—we can also assume that there are otherregions in the universe besides the Anunnaki enclave. This would explain theexistence of other divine beings (or extraterrestrials) that are not mentionedin the clay-tablet texts and that were probably unknown to the Mesopotamians.GOOD AND EVIL IN THE DIVINE WORLDThe first impression we get is that there were “black sheep” among the gods thatemerged from Apsu and Tiamat. In a motherly way, Tiamat wanted to tolerate them,but Apsu wanted to eliminate them so as to restore order and peace. Thetroublemakers then carried out a revolution and took power through violence andmurder. (This resembles the familiar story about Satan and the fallen angels whofollowed him.) Tiamat, convinced of the need to fight, prepared to intervene anddefend herself.Which side is evil then? On the one hand, the texts mention the “evil plan” ofMummu and Apsu for doing away with the “divine troublemakers,” and it is writtenthat Tiamat “contemplated the evil in her heart” (other, remarkably different,translations are “grieved in her heart,” “suppressed the evil in her belly,”“despaired about the evil plans,” and “uttered a curse”) when she first rejectedthis plan. On the other hand, Enki murders his grandfather and has hisgrandmother killed—the two primordial Gods, the father and mother of the wholecreation! Marduk then becomes the lord of the world, the god of our Earth, andfinally the chief god of Babylon. This gives us the impression that good andevil are being described from the subjectively reversed view of theirworshippers—a view that is uncritically adopted by ethnologists and theologians.To the critical reader, however, Enki, Anshar, and Marduk may well appear as thereal culprits. Are they the thugs of the divine world, who take power over partof Apsu’s realm through cunningness and murder?Later the Anunnaki came to the Earth and “created” human beings here—not out ofthe primordial energy, which would have been a real creation; rather theymanufactured them through genetic manipulation of existing forms of life. (Hereas elsewhere, I sometimes place the word create in quotation marks, because truecreation manifests something out of the primordial energy that was not therebefore. Making something through manipulation of existing forms is thus not areal creation in the same sense.) The two main gods that took possession of ourplanet were Enlil and Enki.Thus the Mesopotamian religion is not, strictly speaking, polytheistic, sinceonly one is mentioned as a primordial Creator, even though it has two aspects,both male (Apsu) and female (Tiamat); it is in a way androgynous. The other godsare subordinate intermediate beings between the true divine and us humans.Analogously, we could regard Christianity, with its assemblage of God theFather, Christ, the Holy Spirit, Mary, and a large number of angels as at leastsemipolytheistic—especially if we take into account the veneration of saints.Ethnologists and linguists have given hard evidence that the Bible (particularlyGenesis and some other parts of the Pentateuch) essentially has its origin inMesopotamian texts that were modified and abbreviated. The Bible begins withbriefly mentioning the creation of heaven and Earth—the significance of thefirst sentence in Genesis and the waters mentioned will be discussed later inthis book in a different sense (see here [9781591433040_c02.xhtml#pg39]regarding tehom)—and then the creation of humans. The Enuma Elish beginsearlier, with the original creation in more detail, and therefore has a sectionthat is missing in the Bible. Theologians and rabbis who resist seeing it thisway are merely using tactics to protect their positions.Anton Parks has written an interesting book, Eden: The Truth about Our Origins,in which he translates Mesopotamian texts in a different way from that of manyscholars.3 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt3] What is of main interest here is hisdescription of the Anunnaki gods Enki and Enlil.According to Parks, Enki is Enlil’s father, and not, as is otherwise commonlyassumed, his brother; 4 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt4] Enlil enacted thisdeception to appear equal to his father. Parks’s view deviates from the generalview of Enki and Enlil, but it appears to be substantiated by the quotation,“Enlil, may the father who gave you life, Enki, with Ninki [Damkina], say aprayer on my behalf.” The translation of this quotation is, however, uncertain.5[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt5] Another text mentions Enlil as the father ofEnki.6 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt6] Hence this question has not yet beensettled. In any case, Enlil, “the lord of wrath,” does not love the human racebut despises it. Humans are mere animals to him.Enki is sometimes described as a snake, perhaps because of his wisdom. The lordof knowledge, he holds the secret of the gods that humans should not know.7[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt7] But transgressing this prohibition, he hasrevealed certain secrets to the humans. Thus he is friendly to the humans.THE CELESTIAL CEILING AND THE EARTHThe gods assisting Tiamat tried to escape, but they were caught and theirweapons were destroyed. Marduk split the skull of Tiamat and cut her bloodvessels. He let the north wind carry her skull (also translated as “her blood”)to distant regions, and the gods who were on his side rejoiced. He cut up therest of the body as a fish is cut up for drying. He let one half of it form aceiling in the sky. He spread her skin out and assigned a watcher to prevent her“water” (energy) from escaping. From the other part, he formed Esharra—theEarth. He also fashioned abodes for the great gods on Earth.Marduk set the zodiac in the sky and divided the year in twelve months. Hedeclared Nibiru to be the abode of the gods that announces their duties. Finallyhe put the Moon in its orbit. This means that he set the orbit of the Eartharound the Sun as well as that of the Moon around the Earth. This determines thezodiac and the movement of the Moon, the division of the year into months.The gods at work here were the Anunnaki, whose highest god was Enki’s fatherAnu, the god of the heavens. Nibiru is regarded by many as their domicile.THE CREATION OF HUMANSMarduk spoke (Enuma Elish): “I will form blood and let bones come to be. Then Iwill make the human being, his name shall be ‘man.’ Yes, I will make the human!Upon him shall be imposed the duty to serve the gods so that they may rest.”Kingu was killed as punishment for provoking Tiamat’s fight, and man on Earthwas made out of his blood and his bones.Other clay tablets give more details about how the human race was “created.”Another way of “creation” is mentioned, over which the goddess of birth,Ninhursag (“lady of the holy mountains”)—also called Mami (“mother”), Nintu(“goddess of birth”), or BeletIli (“lady of the gods”)—is appointed.The humans were to cultivate and water the fields so that they would producemuch for the Anunnaki. They were also to celebrate the feasts of the gods andkeep oxen, sheep, cattle, fish, and poultry. Other tablets mention that thehumans were fashioned to serve the gods without freedom of their own.As slaves of the gods.A SANCTUARY ON EARTHThree hundred Anunnaki became watchers of heaven. Another three hundred wereassigned for service on Earth. The latter are called Igigi. (It is not clear,however, exactly which Anunnaki group is called Igigi.)A high, tower-shaped temple was erected in Babylon, called Esagila, in whichlounges for Marduk, Enlil, and Enki were arranged. The Anunnaki also put upaltars for themselves. Marduk was, in a quite dictatorial manner, appointed godof the humans by Anu (his grandfather).WHAT IS NIBIRU?The Enuma Elish mentions Nibiru on tablet 5, line 6 (some translators writeNebiru or Neberu). Translators into various languages have rendered this bydifferent names—such as polestar, Jupiter, Mercury, pole of the universe, theone who seizes the middle, the one who seizes Tiamat in the middle, planet ofpassage (or crossing)—or it is left untranslated. On tablet 7, lines 124–9,Nibiru is said to be a star that controls the passage between heaven and Earth,and it is the “star of Marduk.”Taken from a number of different translations and versions (into English,German, and French), the following quotations contain about all that the EnumaElish tells us about Nibiru. Material in parentheses consists of variationsamong these translations (note the remarkably different choices of words):He established the divisions of the year through signs (constellations of thezodiac; set up three stars each for the twelve months), he established (gavethem) the position of Nibiru to determine their relations (mark out theircourse; fix the distance between the stars). So that no one would go astray(make an omission, an act of negligence; transgress or be slothful), he set upthe stations of Enlil and Enki (with Nibiru). He opened gates on both sides andattached strong bolts (locks; a strong corridor) to the left and to the right.He placed the zenith (the heights of heaven; the superior zones) in her(Tiamat’s) belly (in her midst; in her liver; in the heavenly vault). (Tablet 5,3ff.)He indeed determined the end and the beginning (shall hold the beginning and thefuture; is the warden of all peoples). As Nibiru, the seizer of the midst (ofTiamat), may he keep the passage (place of crossing) of heaven and thenetherworld (between heaven and Earth; keep the turning points of the orbit).They (the gods) should not pass up or down (above or below; everyone who cannotfind the passage), but wait for him (pay homage to him). Nibiru is his star thathe made to shine in the sky, may it take its position on the heavenly staircase(celestial ladder) so that it can be seen (so that it may maintain beginning andend; so that it may be venerated). Yes, he who constantly (tirelessly; withoutresting) crosses the sea (forces his way through Tiamat; passes through themiddle of Tiamat), his name shall be Nibiru, who controls (grasps; seizes;occupies) her middle (the crossroads). May he uphold the course of the stars ofheaven and shepherd all gods like sheep. May he bind (vanquish; subdue) Tiamatand bring mortal danger to her life (constrict her breath; narrow and shortenher life; may her life be straight and short; he conquered Tiamat, he troubledher and ended her life). (Tablet 7, 123ff.)The translation by Nancy K. Sandars is a bit different, describing Nibiru thus:“He who once crossed the firmament tirelessly now is the nub of the universe.”8[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt8] I do not, however, agree with her description ofApsu as “sweet water” or of Tiamat as “bitter water,” or with a few other thingsin her version that she renders according to common academic opinion (cf.footnote 3 [9781591433040_ftn.xhtml#fr3]). What here is called water is anenergy (as noted previously), but the narrow worldview of official sciencecannot conceive of such energies. Therefore it is assumed that Tiamat is the seaor saltwater (not bitter water), while Apsu is the sweet water in the rivers ofMesopotamia. Both are, of course, sustainers of life on Earth. An early andstill less plausible translation of Apsu was abyss.It is interesting that Tiamat’s life should be described here as short and inmortal danger, since according to the preceding tablets of the Enuma Elish, shewould already be dead. A translation by Wolfram von Soden (here translated fromthe German) reads: “Nibiru should hold the passages from heaven to Earthoccupied, because everyone above and below who does not find the gateway alwaysasks him. Nibiru is his (Marduk’s) star that they made visible in the sky. Hetakes position at the turning point and then they may look at him and say ‘Whowithout rest crosses the midst of the sea (Tiamat), his name should be Nibiru,because he seizes the midst of it.’ They shall keep the path of the stars in thesky unchanged.”9 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt9] The remarkable differences in theversions illustrate the difficulties translators have with these passages. Theconcepts of Tiamat as a “sea” and as an entity are mixed in a rather unclearmanner—an uncertainty that to some extent appears to be already present in theoriginal text.Hardly anyone appears to have taken up the questions: Where would a passage be,and where would the middle of the “sea” (allocated to Tiamat) be? How would acrossing take place here? Is Nibiru watching that passage, and can one crossonly with its permission?Since Nibiru is also called a star or a planet (or in any case a heavenly body),many want to understand it as the domicile of the Anunnaki. Zecharia Sitchin(1920–2010) described it as such in his first book The 12th Planet, but there hedid not call it Nibiru.10 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt10] He only writes about a“twelfth planet,” which he calls “Marduk,” because in ancient times, the Moonand the Sun were regarded as planets, and that, along with the nine known to us,makes eleven. If there were one more, it would be the twelfth. In later bookssuch as The Wars of Gods and Men11 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt11] and others, henames this hypothetical planet as Nibiru. Sitchin’s interpretation ofMesopotamian texts has always been criticized by official science. How can weform an opinion about this matter?For over a hundred years, official astronomy has speculated that there could bea planet beyond Neptune, called planet X, which could explain certain anomaliesin the orbits of the known outer planets.12 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt12] Thereare also speculations about a star, Nemesis (of the brown-dwarf type), whichrevolves around the Sun far outside the orbits of the known planets and whichwould have planets of its own.13 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt13] Another outlyingspeculative planet is Tyche.14 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt14] Still another oneis Hercolubus;15 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt15] if it exists, its gravitationwould have caused natural catastrophes in ancient times when it came close toEarth. Other names for such a hypothetical planet are “The Destroyer” or“Wormwood” (after a star of that name in Revelation 8:11). A smalltrans-Neptunian planet, Eris (earlier called Xena), was discovered in 2005 andhas a moon named Dysnomia.Within the frame of such considerations, Sitchin’s hypothesis would not be tooodd if it were not for the fact that he believed that his twelfth planet waspopulated—by Anunnaki. Such an opinion is taboo in the scientific world. Onecarefully refrains from making oneself a subject of colleagues’ ridicule orbecoming a target for intrigue, because that could mean the end of a career. Formainstream science, extraterrestrials are not allowed to exist, much less aliencivilizations, and least of all ones that are ahead of us technologically.According to Sitchin, the orbit of Nibiru is a long ellipse, like that of acomet. The period of revolution around the Sun would be 3,600 years. Inprehistoric times, the planet would have entered our solar system from somewherein space and then stayed here. The latter fits in with one description of Nibiruin an alternative translation mentioned above: “He who once crossed thefirmament tirelessly now is the nub of the universe.”Enuma Elish describes Nibiru as “shining.” Hebrew is related to some of theMesopotamian languages. In Gesenius’s Hebrew lexicon, the word niberash =“shine, radiate” is mentioned as an unused root.16[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt16] A word that has much the same meaning is heylal =“the shining one” or “the bringer of light,” a word that in the Latintranslation of the Bible becomes “Lucifer.” (A chain of associations that couldlead to speculations. . . . )Parks rightly criticizes Sitchin’s hypothesis, since the latter never (or onlyrarely) supported it with references to sources—beyond the meager information inthe Enuma Elish—and never answered questions about it.In my view, Sitchin held back important information in the Enuma Elish, such asthe deicides—the assassination of Apsu and Tiamat by their own creations. If wetake the Enuma Elish reasonably seriously (as we are attempting to do here),this scandalous information is extremely important, because it has to do withthe apostasy of a corresponding part of the creation, a literal fall of theangels and an original sin, the sin of sundering, as it were. Sitchin nevermentioned this.Sitchin’s theory about Nibiru has led to a flood of internet posts. Hardly aweek passes by when someone does not report having seen Nibiru looking like asecond sun or some other apparition in the sky. Videos and pictures have beenposted, but it is likely that at least some have been graphically manipulated. Ihave myself never had such a sighting, and, lacking personal confirmation, Iregard this evidence as doubtful. There are also calculations reckoning theorbit and position of Nibiru in the sky as well as the time of its next approachto Earth. They differ considerably and cannot be harmonized. This certainly doesnot mean that there is no such planet, but it does mean that many are taking usfor a ride, constructing their own “reports.” Or perhaps it is a matter ofdisinformation.At one time I gave more credence to Sitchin’s theories than I do today (althougheven then I did not agree with everything he wrote). They could, however, enableus to understand certain Bible passages in another way than that of conventionaldogma. Some of these will be discussed below. In short, I consider some of histheories to be noteworthy, although they are best taken with a pinch of salt.There is in my view no real contradiction in interpreting the Enuma Elish andother Mesopotamian texts as saying that extraterrestrials have influencedhumanity, however taboo such a view may be in the scientific camp. Such aninterpretation is not confronted with logical contradictions; instead it isgreeted with emotional reactions.In Parks’s opinion, the abode of the gods is not Nibiru but Duku, the holyhill—but only after they arrived on the Earth. Where did they then comefrom—from a celestial Duku? Marduk(u) could mean either protector or son ofDuku. A mountain in Kharsag or Hursag (possibly an unidentified mountain rangeor strip of raised land outside the Mesopotamian plain) is also called Duku—thetown Kharsag is regarded by some as the prototype of the garden of Eden. On theother hand, kharsag in Sumerian means mountain in general; it is not the name ofa specific mountain. The oldest religious text of Mesopotamia is said to comefrom there, written on a cylinder that is called the Barton cylinder after itsdiscoverer: George Anton Barton published the first translation of it in 1918.17[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt17]Parks translates the first section of this text in an interpretive manner: “Theycame in strength from beyond time, they were carried, one day, by the rebellion[word uncertain] of the universe. Enlil’s food would give them life. On behalfof the Lady Serpent (Sir, Ninmah, Ninkharsag) there was an imploration, becauseshe granted the favor that would make all of them live.”18[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt18] Barton, by contrast, translated this passagethus: “He came forth, from Kesh he came, Enlil, the food of Enlil gives himlife. Unto Sir there is a cry, she grants favor, makes all live.”19[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt19] It is unclear from what source Parks has all theother words. Kesh was a Sumerian town, but according to Parks, the wordoriginally meant universe, or the rest of the world. Parks describes Enlil asshatam, a Sumerian word that according to him means “(territorial)administrator.” He explains that there is a character in the Sumerian text thatcan mean either lul (liar) or shatam, and he chooses the latter. At this pointhe discusses the identity of Satan and incorrectly asserts a relation to theHebrew word satam, which, he says, means hate or pursue, although it actuallymeans stop, prevent, or snare. (I will take this subject up again later.) Enlilis also called “lord (who came) from the night and of our men of well-drilling”and “lord of the storm and our men of the pickax.”Parks’s translation here mentions the diseases that have been imposed on humans“from above” to reduce their numbers, because they (probably with the help ofEnki) had achieved unauthorized access to the “garden of the gods” (cf. theFlood [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#c01s01.09] story). But Enki took some effort toprepare a remedy in the form of an alcoholic beverage (probably an herbaltincture or a beer made from fermented fruits and herbs).Reading, with Parks, that the gods came from somewhere “beyond time” because ofa “rebellion of the universe” to settle in Duku fits in with Sitchin’s theoryabout Nibiru as a celestial body that came from beyond our solar system; doesthe statement “Enlil came from the night” refer to the interstellar darkness?Even though there is room for doubt, this theory does not appear fully out ofplace. It deserves to be taken into consideration.It is not at all astonishing that Parks—like Sitchin, but in different ways—hasbeen strongly criticized for his translations and interpretations and has beencalled a source of disinformation by representatives of the “classical” view.20[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt20] Naturally one side will want to defend this viewand will therefore denigrate anyone who does not belong to the club. At the sametime much of the criticism of Parks appears justified to me. As usual, the truthis likely to lie in the middle. Readers may try to draw their own conclusionsfrom the references in endnote 20 (even though they are in French). In any case,Parks’s translations are remarkably wordy and so interpretive that histranslations are often considerably longer than the conventional ones, oftencontaining words that are not found in other translations.TIAMAT: THE CELESTIAL CEILINGSitchin considers the celestial ceiling to be the asteroid belt. How did thisbelt come to be? There is an empirical rule in astronomy called the Titius-Bodelaw. It is expressed through the formula Rn = 4 + 3·2n, where Rn is a measurefor the mean radius of a planetary orbit and n is the number of the planet,counting from the Sun but beginning with Venus. For Venus, then, n = 0, for theEarth n =1, and so on. For n = 3, however, there is a gap between Mars andJupiter. Here one would expect to find a planet, but instead there is a giganticnumber of asteroids, rocks, and stones, called the asteroid belt. It has beensuggested that these could be remnants of a hypothetical planet that burstasunder, called Mallona or Phaeton. Today’s astronomy has alternativeexplanations and has distanced itself from this theory, but it may neverthelessbe of interest, because it is not unlikely.Sitchin claims that this planet, which he calls Tiamat, had come to a collisioncourse with Nibiru, because the latter would have an elongated elliptic orbitthat crosses the orbits of the other planets (which would fit the expression“planet of crossing”). He interprets the mythic fight between Marduk (Nibiru)and Tiamat as a real physical collision, in which the planet Tiamat was crushedto pieces by a moon of Nibiru. About half of Tiamat broke into rubble anddebris, which then formed the asteroid belt. The other half was thrown out ofthe orbit, later to form the Earth (Esharra).If we hypothetically regard the Enuma Elish as more than just a myth andconsider Sitchin’s claim that Nibiru would have been (and still is) populated bythe Anunnaki, we may ask if the planet Tiamat was also populated. In that case,each of the two populations may have attempted to save themselves by divertingthe orbit of the other planet or, if necessary, destroying it. It is not clearwhy Sitchin calls the planet Tiamat, but it could have had a civilizationbelonging to another region of the creation and not in accord with the“renegade” Anunnaki from the other enclave (see here[9781591433040_c01.xhtml#pg6]), in some way like two different political camps,of which one was oriented toward Tiamat.Parks instead claims that Nibiru was a moon of the exploded planet Phaeton(Tiamat). That is hardly consistent with the destruction of the planet. Howcould it then have burst to pieces? As a result, Sitchin’s collision theoryseems to fit better.One thing that representatives of official science will find disagreeable is theclaim that the ancient Anunnaki were more advanced technologically than we aretoday, at least in regard to their mastery of space travel and their ability tomanipulate lifeforms genetically. How could that be possible? One answer wouldhave to do with the fact that our universe is beyond any doubt multidimensional.Present-day physics acknowledges that the cosmos has more than the threedimensions that we Earth humans can perceive with our limited sensory organs.(Was this limitation genetically engineered into us?) If the universe has manymore than these three dimensions, it is not far-fetched to think that there mayalso be multidimensional life-forms there. If the Anunnaki were, for example,five-dimensional beings, they would be able to do things we cannot even imagine.That would also explain how they could live on a planet that would beuninhabitable for us three-dimensionals, because it spends very long periods ina cosmic night and cold far from the Sun.COULD NIBIRU BE OUR MOON?If we consider the possibility that these gods can travel in space, Nibiru couldbe viewed as a space station in the “sea of Tiamat” (interplanetary space),which, as a floating border sentry, controls the passage between the Earth andextraterrestrial space. This could be big enough to be visible as a “star.” Orcould Nibiru be a base on our Moon?Or is it actually the Moon itself? There is a theory, presented by two Russianscientists, Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, in 1978 that the Moon couldbe a hollowed-out planetoid that functions as a huge spaceship.21[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt21] This could explain some strange properties ofthis satellite. Such a hypothesis would fit in quite well with the descriptionin the Enuma Elish.Both, of course, could be true: there could be an Anunnakian presence on (or in)the Moon as well as on a planet X. There is increasing evidence today that theremay really be such a planet, even though it is not easy to separate the chafffrom the wheat as far as the evidence is concerned. Nevertheless, thedescription of Nibiru in the Enuma Elish would apply better to the Moon. Thehypothesis of a planet X does not fit in very well with the sparse informationgiven in the Enuma Elish. But perhaps planet X is simply not mentioned in thattext.The text talks about passing through the “sea” (Tiamat) and through her“middle.” The “sea” could be the space in our solar system, while the “middle ofTiamat” makes us think of the asteroid belt, which was formed in the midst ofour planetary system from a planet associated with Tiamat. Is the passagethrough this region, through the “middle of Tiamat,” from planet X toward us, orthe other way? That could also make us think of Nibiru as the planet Jupiter(Marduk’s planet), which in some way could be regarded as a “watcher” in or nearthat region in space.Seen from various sides, there are different possibilities, but in my opinionNibiru and planet X are not identical, although this does not exclude thepossibility that the latter also exists. Probably both exist, creating aconfusion in identification. In any case, it appears that Sitchin was the firstto regard the two as one and the same.MORE ABOUT THE “CREATION ” OF HUMANSTwo kinds of “creation” of humans are described in the Sumerian clay tablets.First, they mention a “sprouting forth” of humans like plants out of the earth,which took place at a specific location called Uzumúa (“where flesh is made togrow”).22 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt22] These were a kind of humanoid animalrather than real humans. They did not know to eat bread or how to wear clothes,and they walked on their hands and feet and ate grass like sheep. Another mythsays that at that location humans were made to “sprout forth” out of the bloodof slaughtered gods, which may link the two kinds of creation to each other. Inthis way the humans emerged from an animalistic state. They were given thebreath of life (which may mean souls), and thus became real humans, whopracticed farming.The second kind of “creation,” which Sitchin holds to be a genetic interventionby the gods, is explained in more detail below.The text Atra-Hasis mentions that the group of gods called the Igigi had to workhard.23 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt23] After forty years, they rebelled andburned their tools. Then they went to Enlil and troubled him with threats ofwar. The work they were ordered to do was too hard, and now they wanted tosettle with Enlil. Enki suggested that humans should be “manufactured” to bearthe yoke. A goddess of birth, Belet-Ili (also called Mami, Nintu, or Ninmah; seehere [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#pg10]), was to carry out this task. The gods mixedclay with blood and the flesh of a slaughtered god. Fourteen chosen goddesseswere to carry this mixture to term. The children, seven of whom had male andseven female dispositions, were born after ten months. They became the firstworkers, and they were called lullu. From then on, they were to multiply througha physical union between man and woman. These humans, made to be slaves, hadblack hair on their heads; therefore they were also called the “blackheads.”What is the “clay” that is mentioned here? The gods took it from “above inabzu.”24 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt24] Here abzu may refer to Enki’s temple, inwhich there was “holy water” (special energies?).25[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt25] The “clay” would then probably be a substrate fora kind of genetic process. Blood and flesh contain genes, even when they comefrom an Anunnaku. (Since the word Anunnaki designates a people of gods, it isinherently plural, and I will use Anunnaku as a simplified singular.)The process was not immediately successful, however, because in the beginningsome of the humans had defects, according to the text Enki and Ninmah.26[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt26] In preliminary trials, a man resulted that couldnot use his arms; there was another who could not close his eyes; still anotherwith paralyzed feet; an incontinent man; a sterile woman; and a sexlesscreature. The birth goddess was disappointed. Enki then intervened andrecommended pouring the ejaculate of a man into the womb of a woman. Again thisproduced an incapacitated human. What happened next is written on around tenlines missing from the tablet. But in the end, the gods finally had their humanworkers.What then was the work of the Igigi and later the humans? The Atra-Hasis tellsus that they were digging irrigation canals, such as the rivers Euphrates andTigris, as well as canals and sources for water. The earth they dug out washeaped up into mountains. Sitchin claims that they were also digging for gold sothat they could spread gold dust in the atmosphere of their own planet to reducethe escape of heat, rather like a thermos-bottle effect. (According to Sitchin,Nibiru cools down during the millennia it spends far away from the Sun.) He alsosuggests that gold was an elixir of life for the gods, even though it did nothave the same value as it has for us in terms of wealth (or humans may have cometo regard it as valuable because of demand from the Anunnaki).In his book Slave Species of the Gods, Michael Tellinger also says that the maininterest of the Anunnaki was to take precious metals, especially gold, from ourplanet.27 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt27] In my opinion, however, he refers a bittoo uncritically to Sitchin’s theories, which he supplements with his ownresearch (he takes Sitchin’s fictional text The Lost Book of Enki remarkablyseriously). He found a whole series of ruins in South Africa that, he claims,could have been settlements of the Anunnaki and where gold was probably mined.28[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt28] In Zimbabwe there are enigmatic ruins and goldmines of prehistoric origin.29 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt29]THE FLOODAtra-Hasis, the Akkadian myth of the Flood, reports an evil deed of Enliltowards the humans. He did not like them: they had become “too many and tooloud” for him. He ordered diseases and drought to be inflicted upon them inorder to reduce their numbers. But this was not enough for him, and he planned adeluge to eradicate them. He forbade Enki to warn the humans about this, butEnki transgressed his command with a trick.Enki spoke to a wall of reed so that Atra-Hasis could hear him: “Flee the house,build a boat, forsake possessions, and save life.” Enki described how the boatshould be built. Atra-Hasis spoke to the assembly of the elders: “My god doesnot agree with your god, Enki and Enlil are constantly angry with each other.They have expelled me from the land. Since I have always reverenced Enki, Icannot live in your town. Nor can I set my feet on the earth of Enlil.”The ship was built. Various animals (apparently “slaughtered”—their DNA kept, asin a genetic bank?) and Atra-Hasis’s family were brought on board. His heart wasbroken, and he vomited bile. The weather changed, and the storm god Adad beganto roar in the clouds. Atra-Hasis sealed the door with pitch and loosed anchor.An enormous deluge came. It became completely dark, and the Sun could no longerbe seen. People could not recognize one another in the catastrophe. After sevendays, it was possible to go ashore again, and Atra-Hasis offered a sacrifice tothe gods.The gods were hungry, because there were no more farmers and no offerings werebeing brought. The great mother goddess lamented bitterly about Enlil’s andAnu’s incompetent decisions and the masses of dead bodies in the rivers. Enkiadmitted to having helped the humans to survive and convinced Enlil to adopt abetter plan.When they heard that Atra-Hasis had escaped, Enki and Nintu made a plan toensure that the noise of the people would stay within limits. Death wasrequired. To keep population growth low, children were to die, and taboos ofcelibacy were issued. A female demon, Pasittu, was to take away children fromthe laps of women who had given birth. (Pasittu seems also to have been calledLamashtu and resembles Lilith in Hebrew mythology, who kills newborn children;see here [9781591433040_c02.xhtml#pg53]). The birth canal was narrowed, so thata third of the women would not give birth successfully. Many women would have tolive a monastic life.30 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt30]In a similar but shorter Flood myth, Atra-Hasis is called Ziusudra. The famousGilgamesh epic tells a similar story, and there his name is Utnapishtim. Thistext relates another story about Enlil’s evil. He had “created” a giant,Humbaba, who ruled over a large cedar forest and was involved in the wickednessof the people in the land. To free the people from this evil influence, the heroGilgamesh, together with his friend Enkidu, killed the giant. Even though Enlilhimself had schemed to provoke the fight (probably hoping that Gilgamesh wouldbe killed), Enlil decreed that, as punishment, one of the two friends shoulddie. Enkidu became sick and died, and Gilgamesh grieved heavily.31[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt31]The epic also tells about Enlil’s wrath when he heard that humans had survivedthe deluge: “Has any of these mortals escaped? Not one was to have survived thedestruction.” Enki then said to him, “Wisest of gods, hero Enlil, how could youso senselessly bring down the flood?”THE SUMERIAN TREE OF KNOWLEDGEIn his translations from the Sumerian, Parks interprets the “tree of knowledge”and its fruits as referring to certain tools, because the Sumerian word gish,“tree,” can also mean “tool.”32 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt32] A tool such as aknife or an ax has a wooden handle, like the branch of a tree; the head, a pieceof metal, would then be the “fruit.” This is allegedly a pun between two verysimilar Sumerian words búru (tool; plundering) and buru (fruit of a tree).In Parks’s view, Enki taught humans about a “chisel,” which made the godsnervous, because such a tool can also be used as a weapon. The gods alsocomplained that through Enki humans were enjoying their fate and developed ataste for “luxury.”33 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt33] Because their fate wouldimprove each time Enki taught them something new, imparting the use of metals tothem was regarded as the highest treason. Other translations by Parks, in hisview, support the idea that metallurgy in the hands of humans was of majorconcern to the gods.But the association of a tree and its fruit with metallic tools certainlyappears far-fetched.In my view, the gods’ concern would have a much wider context than merely theuse of a knife or an ax, especially in relation to the tree of knowledge(according to Parks, the “tree of penetration”). Comparisons with othertranslations of relevant texts indicate that the translation “metal” is notwithout alternatives.34 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt34] No other translation ofthe texts would support this interpretation. They all differ remarkably fromParks’s version, and the word “metal” is found in none of them. Since to my mindthere is a lack of logic in Parks’s understanding, I consider it a mistake toregard the “secret of the gods” as knowledge about metallurgy.As an example, Parks’s translation of the Sumerian tablet CBS 8322, published byBarton, results in a completely different understanding. Parks’s version is,again, very wordy and contains many words that are found nowhere in Barton’sedition. Even though Barton calls this text “enigmatic,” there is no reason tounderstand it the way Parks does.35 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt35] Here the textis not as enigmatic as it becomes in Parks’s interpretation.THE TREE OF WISDOMParks’s book Eden contains a remarkable error on page 181, where he claims thatthe “tree of knowledge” in the Bible would be called ‘etz yada‘ (page 191 in theFrench text; in both spelled Éts Iada), whereas in the Hebrew text in Genesis itis called ‘etz ha-da‘at. The real meaning of this is Tree of Wisdom. The verbyada‘ (“to know”) would actually fit his alternative interpretation of theSumerian text as a “tree of penetration,” which he associates with a“penetrating tool” like a knife. The verb yada‘ has two meanings: (1) to knowand (2) to have sexual union with (penetration). See Genesis 4:1: “And Adam knewEve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain.” But the word da‘at (knowledge)is not used here! There is no ‘etz yada‘ in the Bible. Da‘at does not have analternative meaning of sexual union or any other kind of “penetration” (except,maybe, to “penetrate” forbidden knowledge). Since ancient times, it has beenpolitically useful to contend that this tree has something to do with sexuality,but da‘at simply does not have such an alternative meaning. Consequently, thebiblical context can only mean that Yahweh forbade seeking knowledge. Humanswere not to know too much, especially not about certain secrets. On othernon-Sumerian clay tablets it may actually look a bit different, since a fewtexts indicate that Enki did teach Adam and Eve how to reproduce—but noprohibition was involved. Nor is there any connection with a tree. This subjectwill be taken up again below.Here it may be relevant that Enki is also called “god of wisdom.” Is all thisactually about a prohibition from dealing with him?WHAT DO THE ANUNNAKI LOOK LIKE?A widespread opinion holds that the Anunnaki are reptilian entities. A largenumber of images and sculptures from Mesopotamia (as well as from ancient Egypt)show humanoid figures with animal heads, some of which could, with a bit ofimagining, be held to be reptilian.36 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt36] Somefigures are shown having wings. An image from the museum in Baghdad could, forexample, be showing a figure with scales.37 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt37] (Thisis admittedly speculative.) A group of gods, the four Apkallu, are described asamphibious beings with bodies like fish.38 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt38] In thethird century BCE, the Babylonian Berossos wrote a history of the Babylonians inGreek, in which he mentions the god Oannes, who had the body of a fish, withhuman legs and feet. He taught many things to humans.39[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt39]The question about the age these beings could live to creates a puzzlingarchaeological problem, and quite a headache for ethnologists.40[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt40] There is a tablet with a list of the Sumeriankings that states their ruling periods using the time unit shar.41[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt41] The first king in the list, Alulim, ruled 8 shars(or sharshar).*4 [9781591433040_ftn.xhtml#fr4] A shar is allegedly equal to3,600 years, so that king would have ruled 28,800 years! The longest rule givenis for En-men-lu-ana—12 shars or 43,200 years! That cannot be. It appears thatequating a shar with 3,600 years goes back to Berossos, who indiscriminatelyhanded down this information from much older sources unknown to us.42[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt42] The meaning of shar is in any case controversialamong experts. In cuneiform writing, the word “shar” is in this context (it isdifferent in other contexts) represented by a solid circle ● (possibly also withan empty circle ○), signifying a revolution or cycle (but also world, ball,entirety). Is this the length of Nibiru’s orbit? That is how Sitchin and otherssee it. A shar cannot be an Earth year, however, since then all these kingswould have ruled for short periods only. Therefore we must leave it as undecidedwhat revolution may mean here. Jupiter is regarded as Marduk’s planet and has arevolution period of 12 years. Could this be the shar? Then the ruling time ofAlulim would be 96 years, which is much more plausible. It has also beensuggested that a shar would be 3,600 days, that is, slightly less than 10 years.This appears to be a speculative oversimplification, even though it does resultin plausible time periods.image [images/9781591433040_006.jpg]The Semitic fish-god Dagon. He is unlike the typical Anunnaku, but he bears aresemblance to Oannes. Illustration from Illustrerad verldshistoria utgifven avE. Wallis [Illustrated world history, published by. E. Wallis], volume I.Stockholm: Central-Tryckeriets Förlag, 1875.Another possibility is indicated in Suda (also known as Suidas), an anonymousGreek encyclopedia from the tenth century CE. For the Chaldeans, a shar was aperiod of 222 Moon months, amounting to 18.5 years.43[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt43] A Moon month (synodic month) is the time betweentwo full moons (or new moons), and 223 Moon months is said to be the timebetween two Moon eclipses (there are somewhat different concepts anddefinitions, such as a related but similar saros cycle, but we need not go intoall the rather complicated details and theories of Chaldean and Babylonianastronomy here). Such a cycle could possibly fit in with the idea that Nibirucould be our Moon (see here [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#pg20]). This too wouldresult in plausible lengths of reign. (In a mathematically amateurish manner,Harrison calculates in a peculiar way and rather arrives back at the originalvalues in shars but with a new interpretation.)44 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt44]A shar is, however, not only a measure of time but is also used in othercontexts with varying numerical values.*5 [9781591433040_ftn.xhtml#fr5] Only asa pure number is a shar 602 = 3,600. As a measure of time, the word couldtherefore have another meaning, but here its meaning as a pure number has beenarbitrarily applied to its value as a time unit. The concept cycle mighthypothetically fit the cuneiform character for shar, but then the questionremains about what cycle this would be referring to. I find the hypothesis ofMoon months plausible.Also related to this question is the fact that the Mesopotamian cultures had anumerical system based on 60. Our system is based on 2 × 5 = 10, because we havefive fingers on two hands. The Mesopotamians also counted on their fingers,45[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt45] but that becomes a bit complicated with fivefingers. It would be easier with six fingers: a system based on 60 would quitenaturally result. Do the Anunnaki have six fingers? The Bible mentions a giantwith six fingers (2 Samuel 21:20). Interestingly, today there are still personson our Earth who, from a genetic predisposition, have six fingers or six toes,or both.46 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt46] A speculative question: because ofgenetic remnants from the Anunnaki?These kings may not, however, have been Anunnaki but rather may have beeninstalled by them. Some esoteric sources claim that an Anunnaku could live 1,000years and, with special life-prolonging measures (probably only for the elite),up to 10,000 years. If that is so, Enki and Enlil may still be around somewherein their multidimensional bodies. In any case, they will still be present asentities (like the human soul after the death of the body).HOW DO THE ANUNNAKI FEED THEMSELVES?As has already been mentioned, there is no doubt that the universe ismultidimensional, and we may assume that the Anunnaki are so as well. Since weEarth humans live in this multidimensional universe, we too aremultidimensional, but we do not know it, because our organs of perception areimpaired so that we perceive only three dimensions. The Anunnaki’s are not.Hence they have conscious access to energies of other dimensions that are hiddento us, and they can feed on them. When they are on the Earth, there are alsoother possibilities for them.When an Earth human dies and the soul leaves the body, the life energies in thecorpse are also set free. These energies can be perceived by an entity with amultidimensional consciousness, whether it is incarnated in a three-dimensionalbody or not, and it can feed on them as well. This is easier when a human beingdies from violence, since the body is still “fully charged.” When a person diesfrom old age or disease in an ailing body, there is almost no life energy left;his batteries are empty, so to speak. This is of no interest to vampiricentities. Furthermore, humans release similar energies when they have verystrong negative emotions, especially intense rage, fear, panic, or hatred.Entities and other multidimensional beings can also feed on such energies, aswell as on sexual feelings that have to do with lust but not love. Just as aplant can feed on our physical excrement, they can feed on our emotionalexcrement.47 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt47]Positive entities feed directly on the primordial divine light energy of theoriginal Creator, which is the primordial source of all nutrition. Those,however, who have cut themselves off from the original Creator, like theAnunnaki, cannot do that but feed indirectly, from the life energies of otherliving beings, which have better access to the energy of light. We humans havesuch access, because we feed on plants (vegetables and fruits) that absorb lightenergy from the Sun and combine it with substances taken from the Earth toproduce nutrients. Or we feed on animals that have absorbed light energy fromeating plants. (It is still more indirect if we feed on carnivorous animals thathave themselves fed on other animals—have you ever wondered why we are notsupposed to eat meat from carnivorous animals?) Vampiric entities similarlyabsorb light energy indirectly, by way of our life energies.It is therefore no wonder that beings like the Anunnaki like to see violenceamong us humans. They stir up murder and man-slaughter wherever they can andthus get access to the life energies that have been released. To them we arelike breeding cattle (in biblical terms, goyim). That also explains the purposeof animal sacrifice and still more of human sacrifice. The gods do not take anysatisfaction from carcasses, but from the life energies that come out of a bodywith its shed blood, because “blood is a fluid with curious properties” (asGoethe said in Faust, part 1, line 1740) and is a carrier of life energies. Thisalso offers them a way to the above-mentioned life-prolonging measures. If thevictim suffers in the process, so much the better, because then emotionalenergies are also set free.The epic Gilgamesh relates that at the end of the flood Utnapishtim brought asacrifice to the gods, and “the gods smelled the sweet odor of the sacrificialanimal and gathered like flies over the sacrifice.” A scene that tells more thanthe mere words. . . .This explains the prohibition against eating blood. Humans are forbidden fromconsuming blood (Leviticus 3:17; 7:27). Instead animals are to be rituallykilled by cutting their throats and letting the blood flow out (shechita) beforeeating the meat.48 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt48] The blood is for the gods andthe meat for the humans."},{"pageContent":"2IS YAHWEH ENLIL?Biblical Origins in the Cuneiform Texts of MesopotamiaThe Mesopotamian Flood stories remind us to such an extent of the one in theBible that there must be a connection. But there are many other correspondencesas well.Here I will first discuss the very beginning of the Bible.THE FIRST SENTENCE IN THE BIBLEThe Hebrew text in Gen 1:1 reads as follows: Bere’shit bara’ ’elohim etha-shamayim ve’et ha’aretz, usually translated as: “In the beginning God createdthe heaven and the Earth.”However you twist and turn it, it remains a fact that that ’elohim is the pluralof ’eloah = god. It has therefore been suggested that it be understood as “thegods created . . . ” but this does not fit grammatically, because the verb bara’(created) has the singular form. Theologians then sweep this under the carpetand declare it to be a pluralis maiestatis (the plural of majesty or the “royalwe”). This grammatical form does exist in Hebrew,1[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt49] but there is another solution to the problem thatis probably overlooked on purpose.The conventional and dogmatically approved translation of bere’shit is based onthe translation of be as in or at and reshit as beginning. According todictionaries, re’shit can alternatively mean the first of its kind, and be canrefer to the origin. Thus the word bere’shit can also be seen as a somewhattautological expression meaning “the original first” or “the very first” or “theprimordial Creator.” Then the following fits grammatically:The First One created the gods, the heavens, and the Earth, or, a bit morefreely: The primordial Creator created the gods, the cosmic worlds, and theEarth.Furthermore, very few translations have “the heavens,” keeping the plural of theoriginal text, since the Hebrew word shamayim, “heaven,” also has the pluralform and can meaningfully be understood as “cosmic worlds.” Who, then, are thecreated gods? In our context, obviously the inhabitants of other cosmicworlds—planets and other-dimensional realms—that is, extraterrestrial life ingeneral: the Anunnaki and the other gods out there. As mentioned above, if wecan hypothetically view the Mesopotamian texts as being based on facts, thiscould mean that the Anunnaki have annexed one region of the creation, in whichcase there will also have to be other regions.This interpretation has some support in the light of otherwise enigmatic pluralsin the Bible (emphasis added): “And God said, Let us make man in our image,after our likeness” (Genesis 1:26).“And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good andevil” (Genesis 2:22).In both quotes, the Hebrew text has ’Elohim, in the latter quote even Yahweh(the Lord) ’Elohim. I will discuss the latter combination further starting here[9781591433040_c02.xhtml#pg40]. This designation of the biblical god is foundrather often, and it gives further support for this interpretation.Many passages in the Bible mention “gods”: “Who is like unto thee, O LORD, amongthe gods?” (Exodus 15:11). “Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor withtheir gods . . . for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare untothee” (Exodus 23:32–3; emphasis added here and in the following quotes). “Upontheir gods also the Lord executed judgments” (Numbers 33:4—how could he do thatif they do not exist?), and many other passages. The Lord was furious aboutGentiles sacrificing their children—“for even their sons and their daughtersthey have burnt in the fire to their gods” (Deuteronomy 12:31)—and what does hedo then? “When the Lord thy God shall have destroyed before thy face thenations, which thou then shalt go in to possess, and when thou shalt possessthem, and dwell in their land” (Deuteronomy 12:29), he himself sends his hoststo kill them and their children. (I have taken the translation “destroyed” fromthe Douay-Rheims Bible. Other versions usually translate yakrit as “cut off,”from the verb karat, which also means kill, destroy, and cut down, like atree—in this case obviously with swords.)THE MESOPOTAMIAN FLOOD STORIES AND THE BIBLEEven in the beginning of the translation and study of the Mesopotamian texts,the remarkable correspondences between these stories and the ones in the Biblearoused the attention of ethnologists and linguists, especially concerning theFlood. As early as 1876, a publication about this subject appeared by GeorgeSmith: The Chaldean Account of Genesis.2 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt50] A littlelater, a study was issued in the classic work Die Keilinschriften und das alteTestament (The cuneiform inscriptions and the Old Testament) by EberhardSchrader,3 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt51] with a contribution by Paul Haupt.4[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt52] Another classic treatment of this subject is thecontribution by Heinrich Zimmern in the book Schöpfung und Chaos in Urzeit undEndzeit (Creation and chaos in primeval times and in the end times) by HermannGunkel.5 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt53] A newer work about this was written byAlexander Heidel: The Gilgamesh Epic and the Old Testament Parallels.6[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt54] The reactions to such publications were divided,as could be expected. For devout Christians and Jews, it was impossible thatthere could be a divine revelation earlier than the Bible. Theologians andrabbis tried by any means to disprove a connection. For them, there could onlybe three explanations: 1. The similarities are coincidental. 2. The Mesopotamian stories are copied from or inspired by those in the Bible. 3. They are independent stories about real incidents.It was easier for agnostics and atheists: the stories are mere fairytales.Scholars tried to devalue the correspondences by pointing out variousdifferences between the stories, but the many similarities remain striking.Furthermore, the Enuma Elish contains a prehistory about the creation of theEarth and of life on our planet that is merely hinted at in the Bible.The differences are actually comparatively minor. In the clay tablets, the Floodwas sent upon the Earth because the gods wanted to have peace and rest from thehumans, who had become annoying to them; in the Bible, it was because the humanshad become sinful. In the tablets, Enki warns Atra-Hasis secretly. In the Bible,god warns Noah directly. The shape of the ark is different in the stories. Inthe tablet texts, it rained seven days, in the Bible text forty days. In theBible, Noah was told to repopulate the Earth; in the tablets a group of peopleescaped with Atra-Hasis, and then the Earth could be repopulated. In bothstories, birds are sent out to find land. In the Bible, a raven returns, andthen a dove comes back with an olive twig. In the Mesopotamian story, a dove anda swallow return, but not the raven. There are a few more such details.An extensive discussion of these parallels was published in 1997 in the magazineBible and Spade.7 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt55] This magazine is issued by anorganization that holds the Bible to be infallible, so the discussion proceedsaccording to that view. It reveals how many of the arguments used to contradictthe correspondence theory are forced (some may believe that the quantity ofarguments is more important than their quality). Such difficulties aside, thediscussion gives a good overview of the similarities.FURTHER CORRESPONDENCESBesides the Flood story, there are many other correspondences between the Bibleand the Mesopotamian texts, not least between the Enuma Elish and the biblicalcreation story in Genesis. Both are based on the concept of a primordial energy,which is an entity that out of itself created worlds and living beings. Thisoriginal energy existed in an original chaos, surrounded by darkness. But whatis chaos? The word is usually understood as meaning complete disorder, but theoriginal meaning is “total emptiness.” It is derived from the Greek word khaíno,which means “yawn”—as in the expression “the yawning void”—and it corresponds totohu va-bohu in Genesis 1:2, which means “waste and void.” The primordial chaoswas simply pure energy that so far was without content, because no creationeither in or outside of it had taken place. In both stories, light emanated fromthe Creator God—in the Mesopotamian story in the form that this primordialenergy is light—and he made worlds come to be. The gods later “created” humanssimilar to themselves out of “clay” or “dust.” At the end, in the Enuma Elishthe gods celebrated; in the Bible God rests.It has also been claimed that the Hebrew word tehom (“depth,” but also “body ofwater,” “sea”) in Genesis 1:2 is etymologically related to Tiamat (which,however, has been tendentiously questioned on linguistic grounds).8[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt56] Heidel regards the two words as having the sameorigin but asserts that they have different meanings.9[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt57]A certain correspondence can also be found in the twofold creation of humans. Asmentioned here [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#pg21], there are two different storiesabout their creation in the Mesopotamian texts. The Bible has certain parallelsto this also. The first creation of humans is described in Genesis 1:26–7: “AndGod said, Let us make man in our image. . . . So God created man in his ownimage, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them”(emphasis added). The word here translated as God is, again, ’Elohim, actually“the gods.” That took place on the sixth day in the biblical story, hence manand woman were created simultaneously and as equals. Then followed a secondcreation of humans in Genesis 2:7, 2:22.Enki had a book with the me, more than one hundred divine laws and commandments(also described as divine powers).10 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt58] These werewritten on clay tablets, of which today only fragments exist. It has beensuggested that they could be compared to the tablets with the commandments givento Moses. The god of these commandments was Enmesharra (a god of the underworld,an ancestor of Enki and Enlil who is not mentioned in the Enuma Elish). Enlilgathered them and gave them to Enki.Adam is not the first man. He is created only after the seventh day andapparently in another way. He comes onstage in the second chapter of Genesis.“And there was not a man to till the ground” (Genesis 2:5; but maybe there wasalready a man somewhere else, outside Eden, with other or no tasks). Thereforegod*6 [9781591433040_ftn.xhtml#fr6] created Adam out of the dust of the groundand breathed the breath of life into his nostrils (Genesis 2:7). Here nothing issaid about his being made in the likeness of god (but see Genesis 5:1). Adam wasput in the Garden of Eden, in a way as god’s gardener. His name in the firstplace means man, but it can be related to other meanings as well. He is aloneuntil a woman is created for him quite some time later.Here the Hebrew word translated as “dust” is ‘aphar. It means something that ispulverized or ground to dust, or particles. “Earth” as dust (“of the ground”) is’adamah. This is explained by the premise that the earth of the Orient isusually reddish, and ’adam can also mean “red,” “reddish,” “the color of blood.”A somewhat far-fetched explanation. But the Hebrew word dam means “blood.” Couldwe also understand “dust of the earth” as red blood cells? After all, it wouldbe far-fetched to assume that the raw material for Adam would be dry dustgathered from the ground. If we were to understand this material as thecomponents of blood, we would come close to the Mesopotamian creation story(created out of the blood of a slaughtered god!). Blood cells carry genes, andwith that we come close to Sitchin’s theories about a genetic process. “Dust ofthe earth” could specifically refer to blood cells of terrestrial origin, maybefrom animals or some kind of prehistoric humans, which were then mixed withgenes of the gods.Here god is not called ’Elohim but Yahweh ’Elohim, so that he appears to be oneof the ’elohim (created gods) who makes his own “creation.”Adam and Eve ate from the tree of knowledge and had to leave Eden. They soon hadchildren, and their son Cain took himself a wife (Genesis 4:17). His sons alsotook wives. Where did they come from? The solution to the riddle can only bethat god or the gods had “created” other humans before Adam and they couldactively reproduce (Genesis 1:28). That explains Cain’s otherwise puzzling fearthat anyone who would find him could kill him for his brother’s murder (Genesis4:14). According to the common dogmatic interpretation, there would be no otherswho could do it. His parents, his wife, and his children would probably not—atmost, then, perhaps the gods.The Mesopotamian literature contains a story about Adapa, who, because of anunfortunate incident, was called to the abode of Anu for questioning.11[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt59] At the end of the conversation, Anu sends Adapaback: “Take him back to his Earth!” Hence Anu’s abode is not on our planet. Ithas repeatedly been suggested that this is a parallel to the biblical storyabout Adam in Eden, but I do not find this very convincing. But something elsestrikes me. At the entrance to Anu’s abode, there are two “watchers,” Tammuz andGishzida. Tammuz (Dumuzi, Du’zu) is the Sumerian god of food, vegetation, andfarming, while Gishzida (Gizzida, Ningishzida) is the lord of the “good tree”and of healing. These remind us of the two trees in the Garden of Eden. One mayalso speculate about parallels to the two pillars, Jachin and Boaz, at theentrance to Solomon’s temple (1 Kings 7:21).Further correspondences have been studied extensively in the literature.12[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt60] An interesting overview by the well-knownAssyriologist Wilfred George Lambert (1926–2011)13[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt61] is published in the renowned German encyclopediaTheologische Realenzyklopädie,14 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt62] in which hevisibly strives to play down the significance of the many correspondences, eventhough the unbiased reader will regard them as important evidence. I suppose hedid so because he was a Christadelphian15 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt63] andthus belonged to a community that strives to live their lives and faithexclusively according to the word of god as written in the Bible.16[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt64] Therefore any proof of a Mesopotamian origin ofthe biblical texts would conflict with his personal beliefs.It is interesting that some authors give an overview of these correspondencesand parallels with the intention of devaluing them, and even so provide helpfulmaterial for discussion.WHO IS YAHWEH?Yahweh is the god in the Hebrew Bible and in the Old Testament of the ChristianBible. It is in the Bible written only with consonants as YHWH, since in Judaismhis name is not to be pronounced. Instead, when referring to him, one is to sayAdonai. This word is an ancient plural (again!) of adon = lord. There arevarious theories about which vowels could be applied to the four consonants. Thename is also called the Tetragrammaton or “the four letters.” Today thegenerally accepted theological pronunciation is “Yahweh,” but a common variantis “Yehowah,” approximately adopting the vocalization of Adonai. He explains hisname himself as “I am that I am” in Exodus 3:14.*7 [9781591433040_ftn.xhtml#fr7]Other vowels have also been inserted into YHWH, which leads to other meanings(one such vocalization, Yahaoah (letter vav read as “o”), could even meansomething like “bringing calamity”).*8 [9781591433040_ftn.xhtml#fr8]So who isthis god? Discoveries in the latter decades by research in the history ofreligion shed light on this. This is controversial, because this subject hasvery much to do with personal questions of faith and, therefore, requires asomewhat more extensive discussion.17 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt65]RESULTS FROM ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDINGSIn recent decades, archaeological findings in the research into the history ofreligion have almost revolutionized our views about the origins of monotheism.It turns out that the Hebrew-Christian religion was originally polytheistic andeven worshipped goddesses. In preexilic times (prior to the fifth century BCE),Asherah was primarily worshipped, but later, especially during the Babylonianexile (586–539 BCE), the religion of the Hebrews became a strictly dogmaticmonotheism. Asherah, like other goddesses, was eliminated, and her symbols weredestroyed in a drive toward patriarchy.Unfortunately, these findings are still more or less unknown to the public. Thechurch seems to ignore them, even though they are subjects of articles inscientific journals, theses, and symposia at university faculties for thehistory of religion. Here I will give a short overview of current findings,chiefly based on the extensive documentation of the symposium Ein Gott allein?(Only one God?), with contributions in German and English.These remarkable results do not indicate that there was no highest God, noprimordial Creator, in the earliest monotheistic religions. But they do raisethe question of whether our monotheistic religions actually relate to thatprimordial Creator, or whether they are pseudomonotheistic religions that relateto a kind of “intermediate god” that slipped into the original Creator’s role(or was inserted into it for political reasons—by gods or by humans). As we haveseen, Apsu, and not Anu or Marduk, is the original Creator in the Mesopotamiancreation story—and in union with Tiamat! These two were devalued and in a waydethroned. Other gods pushed themselves in between them and us. The situation inIndia is a bit similar, although it is more open. There Parabrahman is held tobe the one highest God, but no other deity tries to steal the show from him. If,for example, someone is devoted to Vishnu or Shiva, he knows that the deity isnot the primordial Creator himself but, being itself created, in a wayrepresents him.The church and religious teachings have drummed into our heads the idea thatthere is only one God. Since ancient times, the god of the Old Testament is heldto be the only one. In regard to this issue, Professor Walter Dietrich (Bern,Switzerland) writes in his introduction to Ein Gott allein?: “Is this imagehistorically correct? . . . There are reasons that can be put forward for sayingthat the normative YHWH-religion at first was polytheistic. . . . In the town ofUgarit [today Ras Shamra] in northern Canaan, a manifold polytheism isdiscovered, with gods that are also mentioned in the Old Testament: ’El, Baal,Astarte, Anat and Asherah. While a peaceful coexistence and amalgamation of YHWHand ’El can be read into the biblical texts, Baal and the female deities arevehemently opposed.” Dietrich mentions archeological findings inKuntillet-‘Ajrud (today Horvat Teman) and Khirbet-el-Qom (near Hebron), whereinscriptions expressly mention YHWH and his divine spouse Asherah. “Theseextrabiblical textual testimonies have understandably engendered a great deal ofturbulence among researchers,” Dietrich explains.This strict monotheism was formed during the exiles in Egypt and Babylon. Andyet, he adds, “For a single god it is in a way more difficult to deal with allareas of the world and of human experience than it is for a pantheon. As aresult . . . a multitude of semidivine entities became established. The figureSatan now comes forward . . . as well as an abundance of angels and demons. . .the semidivine figure of Lady Wisdom also belongs to this context.” Her Hebrewname is Chokmah, in Greek Sophia.Yahweh, a mountain god of the southern desert, became the personal and nationalgod of the Israelites. That has left its traces in human history! Because strictmonotheism can look like intolerance, fanaticism and fundamentalism followed asnegative consequences. “It is not only in present-day times that Islam and,still more regrettably, Christianity are full of examples of how a ‘belief inthe god’ can serve as an excuse for all hinds of evildoing, even genocide.”18[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt66] (This was written before today’s misdeeds in thename of Islam, which are now overtaking those of Christianity.)Both archaeological findings and the Bible attest that the original religion ofIsrael was characterized by worship of goddesses (e.g., Hosea 4:9–14, Jeremiah44:15–19). Then this worship was defeated, and all was merged into Yahweh—maleand female, good and evil, welfare and mischief.19[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt67]Some have wanted to see Yahweh as another name for the God ’El, “but this viewis open for serious objections . . . whatever the exact origin of Yahweh may be,much indicates that he originally was the god of the mountain Sinai”20[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt68] as well as a god of war.21[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt69] ’El had seventy sons, the gods of the seventynations of the Earth, and Yahweh was one of them—the god of one of thesenations, namely Israel (Deuteronomy 32:8, Genesis 10).22[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt70]The assembly of god (or the gods) is mentioned in Psalm 82:1, 6: “God [’Elohim]standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. . . . Ihave said, Ye are gods [’elohim]; and all of you are children of the most High[‘Elyon].”Of course, Yahweh is mentioned on almost every page of the Hebrew Bible; in all,5658 times. Yahweh ’Elohim appears 40 times, ’Elohim Yahweh appears 4 times, and’Elohim 680 times. Subtracting 44 from the last number, ’Elohim alone ismentioned 636 times.IS YAHWEH ENLIL?In the Bible, Yahweh releases the Flood to wipe out a sinful humanity and tomake a new start with Noah. (A kind of reset.) In the Mesopotamian texts, Enlilbrings on the Flood in order to eliminate the whole of humanity, which hasbecome annoying to him, while Enki transgresses a prohibition to speak, making anew development of humanity possible through Atra-Hasis (Utnapishtim, Ziusudra).Yahweh is a god of war and storm.23 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt71] The nameEnlil means “lord of the storm,” and he is also a god of war. His spouse isNinlil (Sud). Enlil first rapes her and then seduces her twice, disguised assomeone else, indicating a negative attitude toward femininity.24[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt72]Yahweh also first had a spouse, Asherah, who was apparently rejected and whosename was later not to be mentioned, so that it was covered up in the Bible. Thistoo indicates a negative attitude to femininity. More is told about her below.Professor John Day (Oxford) alleges in his text “Yahweh and the Gods andGoddesses of Canaan” that Yahweh even may have had “affairs” with two othergoddesses.25 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt73]Enlil is sometimes friendly to humanity but can also be severe, choleric, andeven cruel. He punishes humans excessively and sends them calamities. Who doesnot recognize the biblical god in him? Some Mesopotamian images show him with acrown with horns.THE “SONS OF GOD”In Gen 6:2 and 6:4 we read “that the sons of God saw the daughters of men thatthey were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. . . . Therewere giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons ofGod came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the samebecame mighty men which were of old, men of renown.”These “sons of god” are called “sons of the ’elohim” in the Hebrew text, thatis, “sons of the gods” (beney ha-’elohim). From all that has been said here, itis highly probable that these ’elohim were actually the Anunnaki and were thusthe aforementioned “watchers.” The word that is here translated as “giants” isnephilim, and it actually means “those who fell down (or were thrown down),”from naphal = “fall” or “cast down.” (The word nephilim is sometimes used as amisnomer for “the sons of the ’elohim,” but in the biblical text it refers totheir offspring with terrestrial women.)Other translations refer to the “mighty men” as “heroes,” “tyrants,” and thelike. They are giborim, also translated as “masterly men,” humans with specialcapacities. “Men which were of old” (Hebrew ’olam) could indicate that theyoriginated from beings that had been around for a very long time—again, probablyAnunnaki.After a long presence on the Earth, the Anunnaki left but retained control overus. For this purpose, they ordered some of their people (regarded as “angels” bythe humans) to remain as “watchers” on our planet. Since (as mentionedpreviously) the Anunnaki are obviously multidimensional beings, they can hide inother dimensions, remaining invisible to us. Indeed, they probably engineeredour DNA to limit our perception to three dimensions.Although the Anunnaki apparently left us alone, the watchers became a linkbetween them and us. But this was a one-sided communication and did not work theother way: we no longer received information about them, although they did aboutus. We did not know what was going on and did not have full control overourselves. Instead they maintained a secret control over humans, subliminallyand unconsciously. As is written in the books of Enoch:And it came to pass, when the sons of men had increased, that in those daysthere were born to them fair and beautiful daughters. And the angels, the sonsof heaven, saw them and desired them. And they said to one another: “Come, letus choose for ourselves wives from the children of men, and let us begetchildren for ourselves.” And Semyaza, who was their leader, said to them: “Ifear that you may not wish this deed to be done and that I alone will pay forthis great sin.” And they all answered him, and said: “Let us all swear an oath,and bind one another with curses, so not to alter this plan, but to carry outthis plan effectively.” Then they all swore together and all bound one anotherwith curses to it. And they were, in all, two hundred, and they came down onArdis, which is the summit of Mount Hermon. And they called the mountain Hermon[“fortress”], because on it they swore and bound one another with curses.26[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt74]So the watchers had children with the daughters of men that grew up to begiants. These allegedly took to devouring humans. They wanted to eat meat fromthem and from animals and drink blood. But these two hundred “fallen angels”also taught their children and the daughters of men many secrets about magic,astrology, geomancy, the use of metals, and other things. To god, this went toofar, and he ordered Uriel to warn Noah that a deluge would come over the Earth.The fallen angels were then imprisoned in the abyss until the day of judgment.In another text, the Hebrew Book of Enoch or Enoch 3, the watchers are alsocalled ‘irin and qadishin.27 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt75]The Book of Jubilees tells us in chapter 5: “And against the angels whom He hadsent upon the earth, He was exceedingly wroth, and He gave commandment to rootthem out of all their dominion, and He bade us to bind them in the depths of theearth, and behold they are bound in the midst of them, and are (kept) separate.And against their sons went forth a command from before His face that theyshould be smitten with the sword, and be removed from under heaven.”28[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt76] After that follows a description of a violentdestruction, followed by the Flood.The “sons of god” are mainly described in a negative way, but we may also haveanother impression of them. They had asked god not to “create” humans on theEarth, but since he had done so after all, they wanted to be close to them. TheAnunnaki had “created” humans through genetic manipulation to make them work forthem as slaves and wanted to keep them in a primitive state so that they wouldnot understand too much and would remain compliant. It appears that the watchershad some compassion for these humans and wanted to raise their consciousness bygiving them their own genes, and for that purpose they had children withterrestrial women (although their motives are described as pure lust). Thus thewatchers violated a prohibition, which appears to be their real “sin.” Humanswere to be eradicated through a deluge because they were developing further thanwas intended (and they had eaten too much from the “tree of knowledge”). Thisactually means an ethnic cleansing by god!Chapters 4 and 5 of the apocryphal text The Book of Jubilees even claims thatthe sons of the ’elohim had the task of educating humans and teaching them manythings. They fulfilled this task (even if they might have gone a bit too farwith it). Later they gave in to the temptation to become sexually involved withterrestrial women. What, then, was the real sin? Sexuality itself? Why, then, doboth humans and, evidently, the watchers have sexual organs? Why should theyhave them but not be allowed to use them? After all, in Genesis 1:22 humans aretold to reproduce. The logical answer is that this prohibition has to do withsomething else. The sons of the ’elohim were forbidden to have children withterrestrial women because that way their genes would be given to humanity! Thesegenes led to a rapid but undesired development of humans on our planet. TheFlood was intended to make them revert to an earlier state.Could it be that the children of the watchers were “giants” in a differentsense; that is, because they had a higher intelligence and a higherconsciousness than humans were supposed to have (even if they may have also beenbigger physically)? The accusation that these giants devoured humans (or perhapsmade them captives) could be a defamation used as an excuse for theirdestruction.The word ‘Anaqim, sons of Anak, is found in the Bible as a name for a populationof tall humans in southern Palestine near Hebron and to the east of Jordan (thelatter are also called Rephaim). The word ‘anaq means “necklace” or “long-neck.”The Anakim allegedly wore neck chains and had long necks. It would not befar-fetched here to suspect an etymological connection with Anunnaki! The sonsof Anak could also be connected with the Nephilim, even though the theologiansdo not like to see it that way. The name is found in nine passages in the Bible:Deuteteronomy 1:28; 2:10–11; 2:21; 9:2; Joshua 11:21–22; 14:12; and 14:15.BIBLICAL AND MESOPOTAMIAN GODDESSESNow some may immediately object that there are no goddesses in the Bible. Wewill see. As mentioned here [9781591433040_c02.xhtml#pg46], Yahweh originallyhad a spouse, Asherah. She is mentioned in various inscriptions from theearliest forms of Near Eastern religion. Some connect her with the Mesopotamiangoddess Ishtar (Inanna), a daughter of Anu.“In recent times a multitude of archeological data have been gathered togetherthat indicate the existence of the Asherah cult of the old Canaanite mothergoddess. . . . The efforts of some biblical scholars are revealing in the extentto which they try to circumvent such clear indications of Asherah being . . .his spouse.”29 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt77] Some strive to understand the word’asherah as merely referring to some kind of a wooden figure connected with acult, or even to a tree, without wanting to see a goddess who is symbolized byit. The word ’asherah occurs more than forty times in the Hebrew text of theBible but is usually translated as “tree” or “grove.” Archaeologist William G.Dever observes, “In at least half a dozen of these cases, the notion ‘asherah’will refer to the goddess herself and not simply to a totem-like object. Thereis no way around it. These are Asherah figures.”30[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt78]There is a certain grammatical problem here. In nineteen verses, the nameappears with a male plural as ’asherim, in three verses with a female plural:’asherot.31 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt79] (The Hebrew masculine plural is -im;the feminine plural is -ot.) The male form will quite obviously refer to awooden image or symbol of Asherah, while the female form refers to the goddessherself (together with her symbols, hence the plural). The name is derived from’asher = “happy.”32 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt80]There are verses in the Bible that appear to connect Asherah with Baal. That isan attempt to devalue her cult.33 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt81] For somereason, those involved in the drive toward patriarchy did not want to haveanything to do with her. It was forbidden to plant a “tree” at Yahweh’s altar(Deuteronomy 16:21—the original text here has ’asherah). What sense could such aprohibition have unless the tree—or, perhaps better, a wooden figure—was arepresentation of Asherah? This wooden symbol is sometimes also described as a“pole,” which could also involve a pun with the name Asherah. The root ’ashar,mentioned above, can indicate something that is “straight, upright” as well as“happiness, success.”34 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt82] Something that standsupright—a pole—could associatively serve as a symbol of Asherah. As a kind ofdefamation, some even suggest that such upright images would have been phallicsymbols.Regrettably, most modern versions of the Bible no longer contain a text entitledThe Wisdom of Solomon, though this text can still be found in some specializedbooks of the Apochrypha. “In the wisdom books, the not easily interpreted figureLady Wisdom appears; she may be understood as a goddess.”35[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt83]The first Christians, the Gnostics, regarded the Holy Spirit as female. Manyscholars want to connect this female Holy Spirit with Lady Wisdom—Sophia,Chokmah—who at some places in the Old Testament is even called “spirit ofwisdom” (ruach chokmah: Exodus 28:3; Deuteronomy 34:9; Isaiah 11:2). Accordingto an apocryphal text, Jesus talked about “my mother, the Holy Spirit.”36[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt84] Theologians want to explain the femininity of theHoly Spirit as a misunderstanding, on the grounds that the Hebrew word for“spirit,” ruach, is grammatically female. That looks a bit like an evasion. InJudaism, the Holy Spirit corresponds to the Shekinah, the female presence ofgod, who has a special importance in the Kabbalah.Another goddess is Anath, who is mentioned at two places in the Bible and in twomore in the geographical name BethAnath (house of Anath), which probablyindicates that Anath was once worshipped there. In Mesopotamia, she is Antu, oneof the spouses of Anu. Ashtoreth, who is called Ishtar in Mesopotamia, ismentioned in three places as a false goddess (1 Kings 11:5, 33; 2 Kings 23:13).Athirat or Ashtoreth is, however, the Ugaritic name of Asherah (not to beconfused with Ashtarte). The New Testament mentions Artemis (in sometranslations Diana) (Acts 19:27–37). Hence there is more divine femininity inthe Bible than the advocates of patriarchy would like.A special female entity mentioned in the Bible is Lilith.37[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt85] She is seen as a female demon, and in Hebrewmythology, she was the first wife of Adam; she did not feel that he was treatingher as equal and therefore left him. Then god (Yahweh) “created” Eve for him.Lilith is feared in Jewish folk belief because she steals children from theirmothers after birth. She, however, also plays with children and makes themlaugh. In the Bible, she is mentioned in Isaiah 34:14, where the Hebrew textcalls her by her name, although translations usually render it as “screech owl,”“night ghost,” “female demon,” “goblin,” and the like. In Mesopotamia, she is arather demonic but not entirely negative goddess, Lilitu.38[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt86]One may ask what the world would look like if the goddesses had not been bannedfrom our principal religions. There is a soft, motherly femininity missing inour macho and patriarchal Old Testament Bible. The world might have been morepeaceful and humane had this feminine element been preserved. Of course, theVirgin Mary has taken over some of this role, but she is not a goddess; besides,worshipping her seems to have contributed little to the salvation of the world.Even in politics, only “male women” seem to be tolerated. Maybe a return of thegoddess is overdue."},{"pageContent":"3GNOSTIC SPIRITUALITY AND THE ANUNNAKIHow False Gods Established ReligionA very short description of the creation as described by the Gnostic Christiansis as follows (relying on the Apocryphon of John, also called The Secret Book ofJohn).1 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt87]The First Being is invisible and unnamed and is described as an immeasurablelight. He is eternal and indestructible. Through his will, a female companion,Barbelo (the etymology of her name is disputed; she is also called Pronoia or“providence”), emanated out of him, a light equal to him, the first thought, theprimordial mother of the creation, the Holy Spirit. Through a spark from theFirst Being, the androgynous Autogenes (“self-begotten”) appeared out of her,whom we call Christ.Then out of the First Being and Christ the four aeons of light emerged to serveChrist. The last of them is Eleleth, to which, at the fringe of the divineperfection, belongs Sophia, Wisdom.Sophia initiated her own creation, which in the end led to the material worlds.She tried to imitate the First Being and generated an entity out of herself,much as Barbelo had emanated Autogenes. Thus Sophia wanted to produce offspring,but without consulting with the First Being. Because a male element was missing,an entity came into being that, because of Sophia’s imperfection, appeared likea dragon (or a serpent) with the face of a lion. She called it Yaldabaoth(probably from Aramaic yalda bahut or “son of chaos”). Shocked and shameful, shefirst hid it in a cloud and then threw it out of the Pleroma, the realm ofdivine perfection. It escaped to the lower regions. After that, Sophia, havinglost the grace of the First Being, was called Norea. She later incarnated as adaughter of Adam and Eve. The sons Cain and Abel, however, were conceivedbecause Yaldabaoth raped Eve. The first real child of Adam was Seth.Here again, we have the issue of rape, which we have already seen in thepreceding chapter: Enlil had raped his spouse, Ninlil. As we will see,Yaldabaoth is the Gnostic name for Yahweh. In Genesis 4:1 we read, “And Adamknew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said I have gotten aman from the Lord [Yahweh].” The Hebrew text could also, however, be understoodas saying, “And Adam knew that she had become pregnant and bore Cain, and shesaid, ‘I have acquired a man with Yahweh.’” A highly controversialinterpretation, but it would fit the story.Yaldabaoth stole power from his mother. Although he was still weak, he wasambitious and lusted for power. He emanated twelve entities, the archons, torule in the nether regions that he had occupied for himself, and he also“created” 365 angels as assistants. In his arrogance, he boasted to the archons:“I am god and there is no other god besides me!” That is why he is also calledSamael (the blind), because he did not want to see the truth. He is also calledSaklas (the fool), a word that is sometimes connected with Satan. Gross mattermanifested in his realm.The world of Yaldabaoth is a world in the darker regions where he let the stolenlight of Sophia shine. For that reason, this world is neither bright nor dark,but dim. Those who live in it are used to the dim light and do not know thatthere is a brighter one.Because of Sophia’s regret, the First Being tried to save her distortedcreation. The archons heard a voice and were frightened. They searched to findwhere the voice had come from, and Yaldabaoth saw a mirror image of the FirstBeing in the “water” (an energy barrier between the divine world andYaldabaoth’s world) and tried without success to imitate it. Sophia’s lightbecame weaker, because Yaldabaoth had been able to take a part of it. Even so,she could make Yaldabaoth “create” Adam and infuse a part of his misappropriatedspiritual essence into him.When Yaldabaoth and the archons saw that Adam was essentially superior to them,they regretted having “created” him and wanted to get rid of him. But they couldnot, so they put him in the garden of Eden, an apparent paradise, where theyallowed him to eat from the tree of life but not from the tree of knowledge,because it had to do with light forces from a higher world that Adam was not toknow about.Yaldabaoth then wanted to get hold of the light in Adam and take it out of him,but then Eve appeared, sent from higher regions. Adam saw a mirror image ofhimself in Eve and thus was freed from the ban of Yaldabaoth. It was Christ,who, through Eve’s mediation, made Adam eat from the tree of knowledge.Yaldabaoth then sought to regain control over the essence of the light. For thatpurpose, he launched the process of human reproduction, intending to generatenew human bodies inhabited by fake spiritual forces. These fake forces were toseduce the human race and keep it in ignorance so that it would submit to him.This is the source of all evil and all confusion. It allows humans to diewithout having found the truth and without knowing the true God.Some versions of the Apocryphon of John also mention the Flood. Yaldabaothregretted having “created” humans, who in certain ways were superior to him, andfor that reason wanted to let loose the Flood upon them.So far we may establish the following hypothetical comparisons: * The First Being and Barbelo—Apsu and Tiamat * The fall of Yaldabaoth into dark regions—defection of the first Anunnaki * Yaldabaoth turning away from the First Being and Barbelo to pose himself as “god”—the deicide of Apsu and Tiamat to make the Anunnaki turn away from them * Apsu wanting to reverse the “creation” of humans—Enlil’s disdain for the humans, wanting to reverse their “creation”Kishar, the third goddess (after Tiamat and Lahamu) in the Enuma Elish, is alsoregarded as “Mother Earth.” Could she be compared to Sophia? Again, there isvery little information about her in the Mesopotamian texts, so this will berather speculative. In any case, she was there before the Anunnaki, and she wasthe mother of Anu. Hence she was the grandmother of Enlil, whose mother, Ki, wasone of the spouses of Anu. Alternatively, she may be connected with Norea,Sophia after she had fallen from grace.A comparison of the Gnostic texts with Genesis 2 makes it obvious thatYaldabaoth is identical to Yahweh (and hence Enlil). He and his archons are theAnunnaki. This explains the monstrous cruelties carried out in the name of godin the Old Testament.When comparing the Old Testament with Mesopotamian texts, one should keep inmind that the Bible is pro-Yahwistic and paints a positive picture of everythinghaving to do with Enlil/Yahweh, while the Gnostic texts are critical of Yahwehand thus paint him in different colors. Therefore the latter texts will, usingtheir own terminology, describe creation processes before the emergence ofYaldabaoth/Yahweh that other texts leave out or that were withheld from thescribes.A HYPOTHESIS ABOUT YALDABAOTHOrigen, a church father of the second and third centuries, was not a Gnostic butstood close to them. His worldview compares well with those of the GnosticChristians and may be seen as complementary to them.2[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt88] According to Origen, there are twelve levels inthe universe. The highest level is the divine light of the primordial Creator.Below that are nine angelic hierarchies.3 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt89] Theeleventh level is that of the humans, and the twelfth is the level of demons andadversaries.According to Origen, we in the beginning were all on the first and topmost levelas children of light, who then developed and grew up. After time, many of thesechildren became weary of existence in the light, which had become monotonous forthem (only light and love and nothing else . . .). Therefore they wanted to goout of the light to have experiences that they could not otherwise have.4[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt90] They especially wanted to fully live out theirfree will, which had been given to them by God, and the possibili ties for doingso in the light were limited. The light beings were so closely connected—and yetindividual—that they partook directly of the others’ feelings. If a child of thelight did something that hurt another, it would immediately feel the pain of theother being (a kind of instant karma). For that reason, they did not do all thatthey could have done, but some wanted to try out other possibilities. This wasanother reason for them to want to go out of the light. The Creator God saidsomething like, “This is not a good idea, but because you do have free will, Iwill let you have it.” Then he contracted himself, generating a region outsideof the light. This region grew increasingly dark the further it proceeded fromthe light. (Compare the Kabbalistic idea of tzimtzum, “contraction” or“constriction.”)5 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt91] In that region, new worldsformed, especially the eleventh and twelfth levels mentioned above (that is,those of the humans and the demons). A large number of those who wanted to goout from the light became souls and were put into bodies like prisons.6[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt92] After this, through reincarnation they went fromone embodiment to another until they became mature enough to return to the lightworld and stay there without having to incarnate again.One may then ask if the emergence of Yaldabaoth really was an accident in thecreation, because the Creator God could hardly let a mistake occur. As an answerto this question, I had the following intuitive inspiration, which I want todescribe here as a hypothesis. In the beginning, the darker regions were empty,and some kind of organization or structure was needed before the light childrencould go there. For that purpose, a suitable administrator needed to come intoexistence, but it could not be a light being from a higher level, because thenthe outer region would no longer be truly dark. To serve as a first barrierbetween light and dark, an entity was needed in whom the light was concealed andwho was unconscious of it (just as it is for all of us in this dark region welive in, but we do not know it: when we are used to the dimness and know nothingelse, it seems to be light to us). This entity was Yaldabaoth, who first wentout in the darkness and made worlds there where light children could dwell.Since light is life, we all have the light inside, or we would not live, butmost of us do not know it.YALDABAOTH AND JESUSAs stated here [9781591433040_c03.xhtml#pg59], Yaldabaoth is seen as an“accident” in the creation, an error. He is literally called this in the Gnostictext The Gospel of Truth: “Through this, the gospel of the one who is searchedfor, which [was] revealed to those who are perfect through the mercies of theFather, the hidden mystery, Jesus, the Christ, enlightened those who were indarkness through oblivion. He enlightened them; he showed (them) a way; and theway is the truth which he taught them. For this reason, error grew angry withhim, persecuted him, was distressed at him, (and) was brought to naught. He wasnailed to a tree”7 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt93] (emphasis added). Jesus knewand told too much about truths that Yaldabaoth wanted to conceal from us. Forthat reason, Gnostic Christianity, which had arisen out of the inner circlearound Jesus, was later combated as well, and its texts were concealed until alarge number of them were found again in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945. When Jesustalked about the Father, he doubtless did not mean Yahweh, but the highestCreator.CAN CHRIST BE FOUND IN THE MESOPOTAMIAN TEXTS?Here is a problem. In the Mesopotamian texts, the prehistory before the creationof the Anunnaki (missing from the Bible) is discussed very briefly, and Christwould obviously have existed before them. The only entity in that story thatmight be compared to Christ would be Mummu, who appeared directly out of theprimordial Creator pair, Apsu-Tiamat. The Mesopotamian texts say almost nothingelse about him, however, so a comparison is not possible. Since the Enuma Elishand other texts only tell the story about the Anunnaki, and Christ (Autogenes)in a way that is outside of the story, it could well be that he is nevermentioned in these texts, just as parallel lines of development that led toother civilizations are not mentioned either. The tree of creation has a numberof branches that are unknown to us.Even though the Enuma Elish initially describes Mummu as a rascal, we need tosee this in the light of the above-mentioned reversal of good and bad thatappears to be a tactic of the Anunnaki. Tablet 7 describes Mummu as the creatorof heaven and Earth (rather than as a collaborator with Apsu and Tiamat) and asa helper and protector of humans, who sanctifies and maintains heaven and theunderworld. In any case, there is a trinity in each instance: Apsu–Tiamat–Mummu;First Being–Barbelo–Autogenes; and God–Holy Spirit–Christ.WERE THE GNOSTICS REAL CHRISTIANS?As for Gnostic Christianity, there are two schools of thought in today’stheology (according to the renowned German reference work TheologischeRealenzyklopädie): * The conventional German school assumes that the Gnostic Christianity arose out of a pre-Christian gnosis and therefore is not truly Christian. * The Anglo-Saxon and French schools, however, regard the idea of an origin in a pre-Christian gnosis as speculative. Their position is that none of the texts allows for the assumption of a pre-Christian gnosis, nor of any preceding stages.8 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt94]Today the German view has come closer to the latter as a result of epoch-makingworks by Carsten Colpe. It is possible even to speak of a certain sympathy(although a limited and furtive one) for Gnostic Christianity among moderntheologians.9 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt95] Therefore it can no longer be saidthat the Gnostic Christians were not real Christians.Characteristics of Gnostic Christianity: * A radical dualism that regards this world as evil and under the rule of hostile powers. * A differentiation between the unknown, transcendental, and true God and the demiurge or “creator” of this world (Yahweh). * A view that humans are, in their true nature, essentially equal to the divine. * A myth of an antediluvian fall that explains the current condition of humanity. * A belief that humans achieve liberation by means of insight into their own true nature and its heavenly origin through gnosis.10 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt96]The last feature, by the way, has nothing to do with the “selfliberation” thatis despised by ecclesiastical theology—a belief that certain movements,especially of an esoteric nature, have been accused of. Such self-liberationcannot exist, because true liberation can only be achieved by means that areestablished by the highest God. How else could it be liberation?The word gnostic comes from the Greek word gnorizo, which means to make known.Hence it literally means knowing Christians. In contrast, one is tempted to callthe others ignorant Christians(or, using a modern expression, to talk about a“Christianity lite”).The Pauline doctrine, then, is not only a deviation from what Jesus taught, butalso relates to the outer circle around him, in which certain important thingswere not said: “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear themnow” (John 16:12). Before Paul began his preaching, another Christian movementwas growing vigorously—Gnostic Christianity. This original Christianity relatedto the inner circle around Jesus, as the Gnostic texts that were rediscovered inthe twentieth century attest. Hence the Gnostic Christians knew many things thatJesus did not mention when he spoke in public, but said only to his disciples.The Gnostic Christians were the ones Paul fought against when he still calledhimself Saul.WHO IS THE DEVIL?The word comes from the Greek diábolos = slanderer, accuser, but also “divider”and “one who throws through.” He is often called Satan, from the Hebrew satan =opponent, adversary, accuser. Who is he?In Job 1:6 he is mentioned as one of the “sons of the ’elohim” In The Book ofthe Secrets of Enoch (also called The Second Book of Enoch),11[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt97] he is called Satanael (Satanail) and is said tobe one of the “watchers”12 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt98] (Nephilim)13[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt99] that were thrown down from heaven.Three quotes to ponder:God’s terrible concealment, experienced as unclearness and uncertainty, is dueto his being the source of evil and good (Lamentations 3:38), life and death,light and darkness (Isaiah 45:7), happiness and unhappiness (Amos 3:6). Beautyand cruelty are to us inextricably tangled in nature and history.14[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt100]According to their critics, these heretics referred to the Abrahamic Godvariously as “a demiurgus,” “an evil angel,” “the devil god,” “the Prince ofDarkness,” “the source of all evil,” “the Devil,” “a demon,” “a cruel, wrathful,warlike tyrant,” “Satan” and “the first beast of the book of Revelation.”15[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt101]As for the paradoxical statement that both come from YHWH: light and darkness,salvation and calamity (Isaiah 45:7)—does it solve the problem, or does it giveup in front of it?16 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt102]What is the problem that is mentioned here? The problem of good and evil,especially of evil. How can Yahweh be both? Is he his own adversary? Since healready poses as the “creator,” he could also hijack the role of the opponent.As if “you need neither a god nor a devil, only me, because I am both.” A clevermove!The Bible and other texts say that Satan was a vain and arrogant angel whothought of himself as being greater than God and for that reason was thrown outof the divine world of light into darkness. This has parallels to claims invarious texts that Yahweh and Satan are actually one and the same, so that onecould understand Satan as a concealed face of Yahweh. The arrogant angel couldwell be the Yaldabaoth of the Gnostic Christians.The devil, be he called Satanael or Satan, was thrown down because of hisarrogance: “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I willexalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of thecongregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of theclouds; I will be like the Most High” (Isaiah 14:13–14).Here a question intrudes: are Satan and Yahweh identical—as some Gnostic textsmay suggest—or is he one of the archons? After the fall, he could have become anarchon that is closely tied to Yahweh. The following intuition comes to my mind:together they play an intriguing game. Satan appears as an opponent to Yahwehfor the Machiavellian purpose of divide et impera—divide and conquer. Therecould be two ways: the way of Yahweh and the way of Satan, which lead to thesame end, and many are going there by one route or the other. In that case, itwould be a clever tactic, invoking a freedom of will that in the end isnonexistent. Could that be the answer? In that case, none of the ways is thetrue one; the true one is rather, in a manner of speaking, the way that takesoff over their heads.WHO IS LUCIFER?The King James Bible reads in Isaiah 14:12: “How art thou fallen from heaven, OLucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, which didstweaken the nations!” (emphasis added). Luther’s version says (translated fromthe German): “How art thou fallen from heaven, you beautiful morning star! Howart thou felled down, you that weaken the heathens!” Other translations haveshining star, day star, and shining one; most have morning star and the like.Only few translations have Lucifer here.The Hebrew word that is here translated as Lucifer or a star is heylel, “theshining one,” derived from helal = shine (but also “boast” and “be foolish”).Isaiah 14:12 more accurately has “[you] shining one, son of the dawn (ormorning).” The association with the morning star is an interpretation; so is thetranslation “Lucifer.” What is meant by the “shining one” is not clear. Luciferis nowhere found as a name in the Bible. Indeed Lucifer (carrier or bringer oflight) is merely the Latin translation of heylel and not even a name. In theGreek New Testament, the translation is phosphóros (bringer of light) orheosphóros (bringer of dawn). Certain ancient texts have “son of Shahar.” In thepantheon of Ugarit, Shahar is the god of dawn, and his brother, Shalim, is thegod of dusk. They are sons of El and are regarded as gods of Venus.17[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt103]And one from out of the order of angels, having turned away with the order thatwas under him, conceived an impossible thought, to place his throne higher thanthe clouds above the earth, that he might become equal in rank to my power. AndI threw him out from the height with his angels, and he was flying in the aircontinuously above the bottomless. The Book of Secrets of Enoch (also called TheSecond Book of Enoch) 29:3–4.18 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt104]Compare Luke 10:18: “And he [Jesus] said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning[astrapé = bright light, flash] fall from heaven.” Here the Greek text hasSatanas, but it remains a question which word Jesus actually used in hislanguage. The Greek word is a translation from an Aramaic text that we do nothave.Is there, then, a difference between Satanael, Satan, and the one who is calledLucifer? I found a possible hint here: “Satanel (The unfallen Lucifer) had theSecret Wisdom, Satan corrupted it.”19 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt105] CouldSatan then be the fallen Lucifer?In Bogomilism, a Gnostic movement of the late first millennium CE, Satanael washeld to be the “creator” of the physical world, with all its misery andsuffering. He “created” Adam and Eve. He then “assumed the form of a serpent andhad sexual intercourse with Eve with his tail, begetting the twins Cain and hissister Calomena.”20 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt106] He oppressed humanity andtold them that they should worship him instead of the true God—very muchreminiscent of Yaldabaoth.Here Satan and Lucifer become mixed up. It is a confusing game that shouldobviously not be easy to understand.WHAT ABOUT ANGELS?The word “angel” comes from the Greek word ángelos = “messenger, envoy,” inHebrew mal’ach. Angels are usually considered to be either male or sexless, thelatter mainly because of what Jesus said in Mark 12:25: “For when they shallrise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are asthe angels which are in heaven.” Being unmarried, however, need not meansexlessness. Female angels are mentioned in Zechariah 5:9: “Then I lifted upmine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind wasin their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted upthe ephah between the earth and the heaven.” (An ephah is a measure of volume aswell as the vessel used for measuring, but in Hebrew, it could also be thefeminine form of a word for “darkness.”)The angel Gabriel is occasionally held to be feminine (Gabriele, Gabrielle) eventhough this idea is taboo in patriarchal theology. Some regard this angel in anot very positive light because he (or she), according to the Islamic tradition,forced Muhammad (then still an illiterate) with physical violence to read andwrite the Qur’an. On the other hand, it was Gabriel who in Luke 1:26–38 appearedto Mary to inform her about the coming birth of Jesus. For that reason, somehold that there are two different entities, and that in the story about Muhammada demon posed in the shape of Gabriel (Jibra’il). The Gnostic text PistisSophia21 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt107] mentions that Christ (Autogenes) tookon the appearance of Gabriel in order to keep from being recognized by thearchons of Yaldabaoth, thinking he was Gabriel, and that he then “found Mary,who is called ‘my mother,’ after the material body; I spake with her in the typeof Gabriel.”Some authors seemingly assimilate the concept of angels with that ofextraterrestrials in general, especially to the Anunnaki. This may apply to thewatchers, or to the archons of Yaldabaoth, and the “angels” that were “created”by him. These may be regarded as fallen angels, but no doubt there are also alarge number of light beings in higher regions as well as benevolentmultidimensional extraterrestrials.WHO ARE ENKI AND ENLIL?So who are the gods Enki and Enlil? As Parks22 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt108]and others show, it can hardly be doubted that Enlil is the one who is calledYahweh in the Bible. Who, then, is the more benevolent Enki? It has beensuggested that he could be Lucifer; in that case he is obviously to bedistinguished from Satan.According to Parks, shatam in Sumerian means a major administrator for theregion of the gods; in that case it would apply to Enlil. Now it becomes a bitconfusing.Slave Species of the Gods by Michael Tellinger23 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt109]is an interesting book, although in writing about Enki, he refers to Sitchin’sThe Lost Book of Enki,24 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt110] which Parks25[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt111]and others correctly regard as an invention.Tellinger writes that Enlil opposed “creating” humans on the Earth and wanted toeradicate them with a deluge.26 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt112] But since manysurvived—through intervention by Enki, as the clay tablets relate—Enlil wantedto keep humans undeveloped, ignorant, and stupid so that they would obey withoutasking too many questions.27 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt113] Wanting to be theirgod, he attempted to control them by means of fear, intimidation, andbloodthirsty power. Since he put himself higher in rank than Enki, he felt freeto do what he wanted with the humans, who had been “created” by the latter.Because of this conflict, he defamed Enki, portraying him as a snake and adevil, and forbade humans to have anything to do with him. Yet Enki, eluding theprohibition, has taught humanity to raise its consciousness in various ways.It seems that things have been deliberately tangled in order to make itdifficult to see through them.As far as Lucifer and Satan are concerned, I believe that they are not one andthe same, but that Yahwistic interests want us to believe that this is the case,because Lucifer is in reality an opponent to Yahweh. Satan would then be ahidden face of Yahweh himself. It has been claimed that Lucifer is not reallyevil but has been portrayed as such for political reasons: because he broughtknowledge and illumination (hence “light-bringer”) that humans were not supposedto have. Thus he thwarted Yahweh’s plans.What is alarming in this context is that there are various human orders thatcall themselves Luciferian, but who in their rituals, magic, and even sacrificesappear outright Satanic. (Some information about this can be found on theinternet.) Some such orders scandalously designate themselves as “LuciferianGnostics” (who are in no way to be confused with Christian Gnostics!). Again,the impression is that the two names Lucifer and Satan have been jumbled fortactical reasons. Nevertheless, a few of these orders, at least at first glance,give the impression of being honest and morally decent. Such obscurity anddisorientation are no doubt in the interest of Yahweh and a pseudo-Christianchurch in order to make people believe that Lucifer and Satan are one. Is this agame of Yahweh meant to cause uncertainty and confusion? Such games may evenhave led to two concepts of Lucifer: one that is autonomous, and one that isidentical with Satan.It is disquieting that there are increasing rumors of Satanism in the Vatican.An Italian book Via col vento in Vaticano (“Gone with the wind in the Vatican”)was published in 1999 under the pseudonym “I Millenari” and caused muchagitation. A whole group of people who belong to the church are said to hidebehind this pseudonym for protection. There was a court action against them, butonly one could be identified. In 2001, another book by the group was publishedas Fumo di Satana in Vaticano (“Smoke of Satan in the Vatican”). These booksallege that secret satanic rituals and worship are performed in the Vatican.28[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt114] It is said that nuns stole the book from Italianbookshops, because they did not dare to buy it openly.The Exultet prayer in the Vatican at Easter is disquieting: “Flammas eiuslucifer matutinus inveniat ille, inquam, lucifer, qui nescit occasum, ChristusFilius tuus, qui regressus ab inferis, humano generi serenus illuxit, et tecumvivit et regnat in saecula saeculorum.”29 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt115]Translated: “May these flames be found by Lucifer, I say, by Lucifer of themorning, who never sets, Christ your Son, who has returned from the depths, hasshed his peaceful light on humanity, and lives and reigns with you in ages andages.” Is Satan actually meant here, meaning that the two are one and the same?Or is this related to the intentional name confusion mentioned above?It has been objected that Lucifer here refers to the “morning star” (or “daystar”) and as such refers to Christ. Therefore, we actually have two meanings of“morning star”: Lucifer and Christ. (For the latter, see 2 Peter 1:16;Revelation 2:22, 28; and 22:16.) For the faithful, it could only mean thelatter, but in view of the discussion above there is room for doubt, especiallysince there are not a few Satanic symbols in the Vatican, including even a crossin the pope’s chair that is upside down!30 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt116]Satan fell out of the divine world, and so did Yaldabaoth = Yahweh. Sophia fellfrom the grace of the First Being and brought light in the darker regions; shewas then called Norea. Is Yaldabaoth the same as Satan, and does Norea have todo with the real Lucifer? Since Lucifer is also called Venus (the morning star),that may fit.Therefore we may assume as a hypothesis that Enki, who thwarted certain plans ofEnlil/Yahweh, could be a benevolent bringer of light. It has been suggested thatEnki and Satan could be one and the same, but this does not fit well with Enki’scharacter. It seems more fitting to see Enki as someone who brings light and toassume rather that Enlil and Satan are one and the same. To bring light intodarkness should actually be good. If someone had been sent here with such atask, Enlil/Yahweh might be expected to defame him as a devil. Even though Enkiappears more benevolent, this does not, however, mean that he would not play hispart of the game in his own interest. This could be another trap on the path.Although we have some food for thought here, we cannot get much further than toleave the connections and relations among these figures as an open question, butwe should consider these things: every devil wants to pose as a god, and everygod calls his opponent a devil. It is the same game on both sides. The image ofan enemy is politically useful because fear is such an effective tool formanipulation. When humans are afraid, they will allow anything to be done tothem.WHO ARE THE ARCHONS?Much has been written and said about the archons in Gnostic Christianity. Whoare they? Yaldabaoth is called the chief archon, and he “created” seven archonsto serve him. They are also called the Hebdomad, “the seven.” The word árchon isGreek and means “high officer” (although, in another context, it also means“origin” or “principle”). These archons are agents of Yaldabaoth, working withhim in his “creations.” The archons “created” seven powers and 365 angels. (Inthat case, the latter do not really belong to the angels of light.) They arespiritually primitive and envy humans for our souls, abilities, and talents(even though we use these only to a limited extent). They want to restrict ourabilities, obstruct our activities, and manipulate us so that we will not eatfrom the tree of knowledge (see here [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#pg26] and here[9781591433040_c03.xhtml#pg56]). They maintain a false world in which they wantto shield us from the true reality. An important aim in Gnostic Christianity isto bypass the archons after death and go beyond and above them, since they wantto keep us in this world to incarnate here again. They also feed on our lifeenergies and emotional energies.This description makes it clear that the archons are Anunnaki.THE SYMBOLISM OF THE SNAKEThe snake or serpent is usually seen as a symbol of evil, but it is also asymbol of wisdom, life, and medicine, and of fertility and protection of holyplaces. Enki’s symbol is two snakes intertwined with each other in a spiralfashion. In the Bible, the snake urged Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge,after which she and Adam opened up spiritually. In the Apocryphon of John it iswritten:But what they call the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which is the Epinoiaof the light. . . . it was I [Christ] who brought about that they ate.And I [John] said to the Savior, “Lord, was it not the serpent that taught Adamto eat?” The savior smiled and replied, “The serpent caused them to eat fromwickedness of begetting, lust, (and) destruction, that he (Adam) might be usefulto him. And he (Adam) knew that he was disobedient to him (the chief archon) dueto light of the Epinoia which is in him, which made him more correct in histhinking than the chief archon. And (the latter) wanted to bring about the powerwhich he himself had given him. And he brought a forgetfulness over Adam.”And I said to the savior, “What is the forgetfulness” And he said, “It is notthe way Moses wrote (and) you heard. For he said in his first book, ‘He put himto sleep’ (Gn 2:21), but (it was) in his perception. For also he said throughthe prophet, ‘I will make their hearts heavy that they may not pay attention andmay not see’” (Is 6:10).31 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt117]This could also involve limiting their perception to three dimensions.Some want to connect the snake in the Garden of Eden with Enki.32[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt118] Be that as it may, the quotation from theApocryphon of John indicates that the snake does not necessarily symbolize evilbut has a double sense, because the snake acted according to the will of Christ.The quotation is reminiscent of another pseudepigraphal Old Testament text, TheLife of Adam and Eve,33 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt119] here shortened: Thedevil told the snake that he had heard that it would be cleverer than otheranimals. He had a plan to have Adam and Eve be driven out of the paradise. Thesnake replied that it feared the wrath of god. The devil reassured it by sayinghe would speak through its mouth. Eve then saw the snake hanging on the wallaround paradise. It asked Eve what she ate. She replied that she ate everythingexcept from the tree in the middle of the paradise. The snake lamented herfoolishness and said that if humans would eat from it, they would become likegods; god had forbidden them to eat from it because he was jealous. Then Eve letthe snake come into paradise. It did not want to let her eat from the fruitbefore she swore that she would also give it to Adam to eat. The snake poisonedthe fruit with greed and wickedness and gave it to her. When Eve had eaten it,she discovered that she was stripped of the righteousness that had beforesurrounded her like glory. All the leaves of the trees had fallen down, and onlythe fig tree (the tree from which she had eaten) had kept its leaves, from whichEve made an apron. She called Adam and persuaded him that he would be like godand realize good and evil, and he ate. Adam now understood what had happened andreproached Eve for it.34 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt120]It is impossible to say which word in the no longer extant original Aramaic texthas here been translated as devil. In comparison with the Gnostic text theApocryphon of John, one may assume that there is the tactical reversal of goodand evil here, since the author of this text obviously was convinced that thetrue god was Yahweh/Enlil. Whoever is against him and wants to liberate Adamfrom being lulled into a sheeplike drudgery will therefore be a devil from hispoint of view. (The devil is always the one on the other side.)As Tellinger writes: “After having a run-in with his brother Enlil about theupliftment of Adam and Eve, the creator of humanity, Enki, realized that theslanderous campaign against him as a serpent, and the evil snake, would befiercely enforced by Enlil.”35 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt121]That the message mediated by the snake turned out to be true is confirmed in theBible itself: “And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, toknow good and evil” (Genesis 3:22; emphasis added).In Hebrew, nachash is a word for “snake,” but it also means “interpret,” “findout,” “decipher.” Saraph denotes a poisonous snake. From this word is derivedseraphim, signifying a class of shining angels, actually “winged snakes” (anetymology that is disputed, maybe because some do not like it); nachesh(differently vocalized) also means “shining.” (Cf. heylel and helal above. Hereone may again speculate.)A fringe movement in Gnosticism, the Ophites or Naassenes (cf. nachash),36[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt122] held the snake in high esteem because it hadoutsmarted Yahweh in Eden and led Eve and Adam to wisdom. And the so-called“tree of knowledge,” when correctly translated from Hebrew, actually means “treeof wisdom”!Jesus said “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be yetherefore wise as serpents, and harmless [simpleminded, Greek: akeraios] asdoves” (Matthew 10:16). Who wants to defame the Gnostics only because of thesnake rather acts like simpleminded doves.DISTORTIONS OF GNOSTICISMAs mentioned here [9781591433040_c03.xhtml#pg69], today one can find distortedforms of Gnosticism that designate themselves as Luciferian Gnosticism. Theyhave nothing to do with the original, true Gnostic Christianity. There is agreat deal of disinformation around about Christian Gnosticism, obviously in anattempt to defend established power systems and deflect threatening truths. Onlythe old Gnostic texts from the first centuries can be taken seriously. Even inthe early centuries, somewhat different versions of Gnostic Christianitydeveloped. One is the Sethian Gnosticism, which relates to Seth, the third sonof Adam and Eve (see remarks here [9781591433040_c03.xhtml#pg55] about Cain,Abel, and Seth). Some slanderers want us to believe that he would be the ancientEgyptian god Seth, widely regarded as a figure of evil."},{"pageContent":"4JESUS’S MISSIONThe Christ and the AntichristThere were two circles around Jesus: (1) the outer circle of people who heardhim speak, and (2) the inner circle of his disciples and others who were closeto him. John 16:12 shows that there was much that he did not say in the outercircle but doubtless said in the inner circle: “I have yet many things to sayunto you, but ye cannot bear them now.”Out of the inner circle arose Gnostic Christianity (which preceded PaulinianChristianity), because the very first Christians in that circle must haveincluded at least a few of the earliest Gnostics. As is written in the Gospel ofTruth, Yahweh was enraged because of what Jesus taught and had him nailed to across. This has already been discussed here [9781591433040_c03.xhtml#pg60]. Whywas Yahweh enraged? Because Jesus said that Yahweh is not the true God;according to the Gnostic text Pistis Sophia, he even told how we can become freefrom Yahweh’s influence.1 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt123]Yahweh expected that Jesus’s teachings would gradually be forgotten, but theopposite happened. Jesus’s sacrifice gave his teachings more power, and theywere carried on by the Gnostic Christians. For that reason, Yahweh wanted toreplace the original Christianity with a new one that would serve his purposes.He brought Paul to establish a “Christianity lite” that no longer had the deeptruths of the Gnostic Christianity or Jesus’s teachings in the inner circle, butmerely told us what Yahweh wants us to believe.In this manner, the original Christianity was gradually replaced by PaulinianChristianity. Yahweh manipulated the Roman emperor Constantine to reject GnosticChristianity at the council of Nicaea in 325 (the theme of the council wasanother, but some Gnostics were present and were not allowed to speak). At thispoint Paulinian Christianity became the basis for the church that developedafterward.Acts 9:4–6 reports about the conversion of Paul: “And he fell to the earth, andheard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said,Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it ishard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he trembling and astonished said,Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and gointo the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.” (Paul probably fellto the ground because he had epilepsy. In folk belief, this was considered to bea sign of demonic possession.)Did this really come from Jesus, or from Yahweh posing as Jesus? Let us comparethis with another vision. It is said that Constantine had a vision (some sourcessay a dream) in which he saw a cross and heard a voice saying, “By this sign youwill conquer.” He then had the cross (a tool for torture and execution!) paintedon his soldier’s shields and won the war he was fighting. Did that really comefrom Jesus? Jesus taught us, “Thou shalt not kill,” “Love your enemies,” and“All they that take to the sword shall perish by the sword,” flagrantlycontradicting the vision of Constantine. Jesus would have told him to make peaceand reconcile with his enemies! Hence that vision cannot have come from him. Didit come from Yahweh, who wanted to have an apparently Christian Church as a toolfor manipulation and control of the people? If so, it also raises doubts aboutthe vision of Paul.We may then in the same sense ask who it really was who tempted Jesus in Luke4:1–13. Could it have been Yahweh, trying to divert him from his mission?Yet the Gnostic Christians did not completely disappear. Some Gnostics remainedin the Balkans, in present-day Bulgaria, and they later spread to southernFrance, where the community of the Cathars was formed. The Cathars (“the pureones”) followed Jesus’ teachings to such an extent that they were vegetariansand did not even kill animals (“Thou shalt not kill”!). In my opinion, they werethe most Christian people since Jesus’s disciples. In the thirteenth century,this community was completely eradicated in a holocaust by the men of thechurch. An extremely unchristian action! It was one of the greatest sins of thechurch, along with the Inquisition, which in its cruelty worked as Yahweh wouldhave liked, as well as the Crusades, not to mention the many wars it stirred up.The Cathars also knew about, and taught, the doctrine of reincarnation. Asconcerns reincarnation, we could imagine that it is hinted at in John 16:12.The Gnostic texts were destroyed in an attempt to annihilate this movement.Luckily, many of them were found in Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945 so that weagain have access to a major part of this treasure of very importantinformation. Did that happen according to the will of the original Creator tosave the truth for our time?A RESPONSE TO MICHAEL TELLINGERMichael Tellinger has written a valuable book, Slave Species of the Gods, aboutthe origin of humanity. But in chapter 5 he writes that “Jesus became anunwitting mouthpiece for his bloodthirsty Nefilim god, preparing the ground forthe continued enslavement of humanity . . . unconsciously weaving the propagandaof a power-hungry Anunnaki god. . . . The uncanny parallels between the murkyorigins of humanity, compared to the origins of Christ, point to the realpossibility that whoever crafted humanity followed it up with a second wave ofpremeditated, calculated propaganda and ultimate control.”2[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt124] He could not have written this if he had knownabout the Gnostic Christians and their texts.His subsequent remark is also untrue: “The one truly puzzling feature is thelack of reference to the messiah in the Old Testament. The word messiah firstappears in John 1:41.” Since the Hebrew word for “messiah,” mashiach, is usuallytranslated as “the anointed one,” used for someone who is chosen by God for aspecific task, we have to search for the latter in the Bible. This expression isfound in eighty-four passages in the Old Testament. and in some of them it maybe understood as it is in Christianity. What is most remarkable, however, isthat Tellinger writes about “origins of Christ” (see above), even though in hisopinion no such origin can be found in the Bible.The Bible and ecclesiastical Christianity have hypnotized us to identify Jesuswith Christ, which has led to many misunderstandings. The Jesus of Christianity,for obvious reasons, was unknown before his birth in Bethlehem. The name Yeshuawas given to him, just as any name is given to a newborn child. But who was hebefore he took incarnation? That we do not know. Therefore it is logical toexpect that no Yeshua can be found in the Old Testament who could be the one ofChristianity. (At least two persons named Yeshua are mentioned in Old Testamentapocrypha: Yeshua ben Sirah and one in “The Book Yoshua,” but only the names arethe same.)But Christ is not a name! It is the Greek translation (christós) of the wordmashiach, “the anointed one,” that has been adopted in almost all modernlanguages. Here there is much confusion. As mentioned, mashiach is in most casesnot used in the Old Testament in the “Christian” sense. That sense was unknownto those who wrote those texts. It mainly became known to us through hismessage, brought to us through Jesus.What, then, was the explosive part of Jesus’s message? As mentioned above, itwas that Yahweh is not the true God! There is one high above him, whom Jesuscalled “Father.” Yahweh is an Anunnaku, but the Father is above all Anunnaki. Ofcourse, delivering such a message in those days put one in mortal danger, and itis obviously the reason that Yahweh wanted Jesus to die.This means that we effectively have two Jesuses: the real one and a pseudo-Jesusof the church. Since Yahweh could not completely eradicate his message, hetwisted it to serve his interests. The first step was to put Paul on stage toteach a modified Christianity. Out of that, a church evolved as an institutionto manipulate the people with another “Christianity” and make them believe thatJesus’s father was Yahweh. John 8:31–47 quotes Jesus as speaking in front of thepeople (see below) in a way that contradicts this, but as can be expected, it isinterpreted in another way by the church.There are, therefore, also two Christs: the real one, who sent us Jesus as hismessenger, and a fake Christ established by the dogma to serve the politics of achurch that effectively has become secular.In a way, what Tellinger writes is actually true—but of the fake Jesus of thechurch and not of the real Jesus.Tellinger repeatedly refers to Sitchin’s books. Sitchin has obscured importantpassages in the Enuma Elish and played them down. Sitchin seems to revere theAnunnaki as true creators—did Sitchin, then, have an unconscious contact withthe Anunnaki? In his interpretation, Apsu would be the Sun and Tiamat a planetthat broke to pieces a very long time ago. But these figures can also beunderstood literally: Apsu can be seen as the primordial Creator and Tiamat ashis female partner (who gave “birth” to the creation). These two are, then, thevery first beings, by whom and out of whom the universe was created. Apsu may bemythologically associated with the Sun, but to identify him with it is anotherthing. Tiamat may be mythologically associated with a no longer existing planet,but identifying the two is, again, another thing. One reason to emphasize thisbecomes clearer when we compare it with the creation story in the Apocryphon ofJohn3 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt125] (as was done here[9781591433040_c03.xhtml#pg54]).In my understanding, the Father that Jesus spoke about is the unnamed Creator ofthe Gnostics and Apsu of the Mesopotamians, who is above all the Anunnaki—andnot Yahweh!JESUS’S MAIN MISSIONThe first mission of Jesus that comes to mind is love. He taught us that love ismore important than anything else and that we are all brothers and sisters inthis world, irrespective of origin, race, gender, culture, or social status.This is the most important touchstone for those who call themselves Christians.If they are able to live this love, seek no revenge, cannot hate, are neverviolent, and even love those who regard themselves as their enemies, then theycan truly call themselves Christians. How many pass this test? Probably only ahandful of all those who claim this name.What is love? It is to want the best for all involved, not only for oneself. Itis a fundamentally positive and helpful attitude to our fellow brothers andsisters, while not allowing others to abuse us. It excludes violence, but incase of an attack allows for defense—whether of someone else or of oneself—bymeans that are as peaceful as possible. Love also includes honesty, justice, andmutual respect. Much more can be said, but this brief definition will besufficient here.There is, however, another and still more important mission for which Jesus cameinto this world: as a messenger of Christ. For many even today, this mission mayappear controversial, and yet it was for this reason that he was killed. No onecan imagine that he was killed because he taught love. It would have had to besomething else for which the powers of this world wanted him dead.We can learn about this in the Bible, if we have eyes to see and ears to hearand are prepared to accept his mission. We learn about it from the first majorChristian movement in this world, the Gnostics.We have testimony in John 8:31–47 in the Bible:Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word,then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truthshall make you free.They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man:how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin isthe servant of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but theSon abideth ever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be freeindeed.I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hathno place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do thatwhich ye have seen with your father.They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father.Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works ofAbraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which Ihave heard of God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father.Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, evenGod.Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceededforth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye notunderstand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He wasa murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is notruth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar,and the father of it.And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convinceth meof sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because yeare not of God. (Emphasis added)About whom did Jesus speak the words that are italicized above? And who is itthat he calls his “Father”? There is only one meaningful way to understand this.The “father the devil” is Yahweh! Jesus’s Father is a God higher than Yahweh,the true origin, the original first Creator, in whose creation Yahweh is alower-level entity who pretends to be the only god.These words about Yahweh are based on facts in the Old Testament. Jesus himselfsaid, “I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have beenkept secret from the foundation of the world” (Matthew 13:35). That is whatYahweh did not like: Jesus came to tell us things that Yahweh wanted to keepsecret, especially the truth about Yahweh himself.Jesus was born to a people that Yahweh, through Moses, had led to the promisedland. After a long wandering through the desert of Sinai, they finally reachedthat land, only to find, to their disappointment, that it was not empty. Peoplelived there in towns. Therefore Yahweh ordered them to kill everyone withoutexception, not sparing a child, a woman, or an old man, so that they could livein “houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged,which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not;when thou shalt have eaten and be full” (Deuteronomy 6:10–11). They conducted aholocaust in which they attacked one town after the other and let none remain,as is vividly described on the bloody pages of Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, andother books of the Bible. By means of this genocide, they stole the land fromits original inhabitants in order to have it for themselves. Is that the work ofa loving and peaceful God, like the one Jesus called his Father? Thisbloodthirsty, revenging, hating, murdering, punishing, lying, and threateninggod? Of course not!Yahweh had already shown his cruelty as they wandered through Sinai. One exampleis reported in Numbers 16:35–49. Yahweh killed 250 men for offering incense. Thepeople protested, and as a punishment for doing so, he let 14,700 persons diefrom a plague.In Numbers 31:14–18 we read: “And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host,. . . which came from the battle. And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved allthe women alive? . . . Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, andkill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the womenchildren, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive foryourselves” (emphasis added). Numbers 31:35 says that they came from a raid andbrought 32,000 virgins as booty, but all the others were killed. Why should allthese girls be left alive? Doubtless for sexual services.A few more examples. Numbers 2:34–5: “And we took all his cities at that time,and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of everycity, we left none to remain [survive]. Only the cattle we took for a prey untoourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.” Hosea 13:16: “Samariashall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall bythe sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with childshall be ripped up.”In the Psalms we read:18:38: I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallenunder my feet.21:9–12: Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: theLord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. Theirfruit [children] shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from amongthe children of men. For they intended evil against thee: they imagined amischievous device, which they are not able to perform. Therefore shalt thoumake them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thystrings against the face of them.137:9: Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against thestones.There are so many examples of this kind that they could fill a book of its own.An extensive account of Yahweh’s cruelties can be found on the Skeptic’sAnnotated Bible website.4 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt126] An interesting textis, “Who Is the Real God of the Bible?”5 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt127]Twobooks about this issue are Jehovah Unmasked! by Nathaniel Merritt,6[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt128] and (in Spanish) Desenmascarando a Yahweh (nowalso in English as Yahweh Unmasked) by David Cangá Corozo.7[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt129] Merritt writes:Human beings are victims of a race of elohim/archons, or “gods” that fashionedthis material universe, and humankind, out of dead defiled pre-existent matter.“In the beginning the gods created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1), andhumans remain their possession to this day. To maintain control over humans, andto make sure Earth continues as our dungeon, the elohim/Archons have made thisEarth a continual source of endless squabbles amongst humankind. They havecreated and fostered religious and spiritual delusions to keep us blinded toreality and fighting and warring with each other, and they have made Earth intoa place of relent less pointless physical and mental suffering and struggle.This sorry state of affairs has existed from the beginning, lost in the mists ofprehistory.8 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt130]Is it not obvious that all this disqualifies Yahweh—who ruled over the land ofCanaan and today rules over the whole world through churches that have acceptedhim as their “god”—from being the true God? When he says, “Thou shalt have noother gods before me” (Exodus 20:3), does that mean that there are no othergods, or is it a restraint of trade, forbidding competition? Is it meant in thesense, “There are other gods, but I shall be your only god and you shall havenothing to do with them”?About the logic of this statement: If Yahweh had been the original Creator, hewould have created the other gods, and he would probably have nothing againsthumans’ worshipping them. If he does, they are not his creations. In that case,they would have been created by another Creator, who, then, is obviously higherthan Yahweh. Hence, Yahweh too was created by that higher Creator.A SUMMARY HYPOTHESIS * Jesus is not Christ, but a messenger sent by Christ. * There are effectively two Jesuses and two Christs: the true ones and the fake ones established by the church through manipulation by Yahweh. * Jesus passed his mission on to his disciples so that they would spread it in the world. Thus Gnostic Christianity came to be—the first and original Christianity. Part of its teaching is that Yahweh is a fake god. * This aroused wrath and hatred in Yahweh, who had Jesus murdered, hoping that his teachings would be forgotten. That did not happen. They were carried on by the Gnostic Christians. To counteract this, he used Paul to establish a modified Christianity to serve his interests. * Then Yahweh also wanted to get rid of the Gnostics. For that purpose, he used Constantine to erect a church based on Paulinian pseudo-Christianity and declare Gnosticism a heresy. * The Gnostic texts were destroyed, but an important collection of them was hidden and discovered in Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945. This is unlikely to be a coincidence, but rather part of a plan by the primordial Creator to restore the original teachings.Nonetheless, it appears that Jesus did not break the power of Yahweh or liberatehumanity from his rule, because the situation became worse afterward. Yahweh’spower and influence became stronger. In this respect, the same questions mayarise concerning both Jesus and Christ. Did he actually serve Yahweh (asTellinger claims) and not the Father about whom Jesus spoke? Or did they fail?Or is this a process that takes a very long time by human measure, but is stillin action and is now coming into its last phase?The first question is in any case valid for the fake versions of Christ andJesus; that is, they were both used to serve the interests of Yahweh. This wouldnot be the case for the true Christ and the true Jesus if the process is stillgoing on, but in that case, it is a matter of a human misunderstanding that isintentional.If the latter is true, Yahweh will know that his days are counted and will wantto tighten his power over the humans more than ever before he has to give up. Ashis last action, he may want to destroy as much as possible of this planet andits population—scorched-earth tactics.Yahweh is an extraterrestrial: he and his associates do not belong to thehumanity of Earth, but to other dimensions in another world, with anothercivilization. For millennia, that civilization has established an invisiblecontrol over us. They claim to have “created” us, but that is not true. Theyhave only modified existing life-forms and have implanted a few chosen genes oftheir own in us. In no way are they our creators. The only thing that they coulddo is to manufacture a small group of the ancestors of present-day humanity onthe Earth by genetic means. After that, no further humans were manufactured butwere procreated by us. These extraterrestrials therefore have no right tocontrol or make use of us. Yet they do it in order to feed on our life energies(invisibly to us and out of our scope of consciousness), as if we were energetic“cattle” for them.Over the course of many millennia, humanity has been manipulated byextraterrestrials who established different religions as tools for control. Somewere benevolent. The manipulative ones, especially those begun by Yahweh, wantedto destroy their competitors and created a fake Christianity to do so. Aninvisible war is on, but in the future there will arise a new humanity,supported by beneficent extraterrestrials (and not by the New World Order, whichwants to prevent that). Humans will have to die by huge numbers in thisprocess—but there is no death. Only the body dies. The immortal soul leaves andcomes back at a later time—into a new humanity.WHO IS THE TRUE ORIGINAL CREATOR?There can be only one true Creator, the one who was called ’El ‘Elyon (thehighest God) by the Canaanites. Canaan, an essential part of the promised land,was inhabited by people who knew the truth, mainly from Mesopotamian sources, ashas been confirmed by findings in excavations. Enlil = Yahweh, mentioned bythese sources, wanted to keep this truth hidden from humanity so that he couldpose as the only god. That seems to be why Yahweh led the Hebrews back to Canaanand ordered them to eradicate its population. Why did this happen, and how hadthey come to Canaan in the first place?The Origin of Judaism was the covenant between Abraham and Yahweh (Genesis 15).Abraham and his family lived in Ur in Sumer. The Bible tells in ancient versionsthat their ancestors had generations earlier come to Sumer from the East(Genesis 11:2). After the covenant, Yahweh led them, the original Hebrews, fromthe city of Ur in Chaldea to the region of the land of Canaan (Genesis11:28–31), where they obviously preserved Mesopotamian knowledge. Much later,many of them were led to Egypt because of a famine (Genesis 12:10). There theywere treated as a secondary class, and Yahweh used their misery to lead themback to Canaan, ostensibly for their salvation. Did he do all this to eradicatethe ancient knowledge through a mass brainwashing or an ethnic cleansing? Heactually had the Hebrews kill their relatives, descended from the sameancestors.Many later versions of the Bible state that the ancestors of Abraham would havecome from the West, indicating that they originally may have come from Canaanand then returned there. An interesting book supports the hypothesis that theorigin of the Hebrews was Sumerian and questions from where they had originallycome: From Sumer to Jerusalem: The Forbidden Hypothesis by John Sassoon.9[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt131] (I vainly searched for this book in severalEuropean university libraries and had to buy it. The hypothesis is apparentlyforbidden in the academic world.) It shows that the Hebrews in Ur probably didnot come there “from the west,” as most of today’s Bible translations allege,but moved westward to come to Ur, that is, from the East. From Persia?However that may be, they brought culture and knowledge to Canaan that hadoriginated in Sumer, or even earlier, still further East. Their culturecontained a religion with knowledge about Yahweh and his own origin that wasproblematic for his ambitions to usurp the role of being the one and only god.Therefore it was in his interest to eradicate this culture and replace thepopulation with those who had lost this knowledge during their generations inEgypt.WHO IS ANTICHRIST?Antichrist somewhat generically means someone who is against Christ and hismessenger, Jesus. (One could also say Antijesus.) According to all that we haveseen above, the main candidate would be Yahweh.YAHWEH AND REINCARNATIONAntonio Orbe (1917–2003) was a major authority about Gnosticism. He wrote asfollows:Christ did not take seat to the right of Yahweh only to be revered by theheavens. As appreciation for his services (and for the death on the cross), anew order was established—throughout the whole New Testament—that was contraryto the previous rule. It was not a matter of preaching the Gospel to the angelsand archons. The revelation of the Father is connected with the Son, the savior.Nor was it a matter of replacing Yahweh in his function of demiurge. Strictlyspeaking, this function continued under a new aspect. The “creator” did notmanufacture new worlds, and he did not shape new humans.What was the task of Christ in establishing this new order? Not all Gnosticsreply in the same way, but most of them agree about one essential thing: Christtook reincarnation to an end. He weakened Yahweh and revoked his rule over allwho believed in the Gospel of Jesus and liberated them from the cycle ofrebirth.During the Old Testament, Yahweh came and, at the root of death, took power overall humans, pagans and Israelites, good and evil, and obliged them to take onnew bodies on the Earth as humans. In such a way, they go from one generation toanother without hope of breaking the chain of births. A subterranean hell wassuperfluous. It was useless to gather the dead in one place. It was sufficientto oblige them to live again in new bodies and under other circumstances (offamily and region) without leaving the Earth. Even the good ones had to paytheir duties to the demiurge and to the cycle of birth into which he placedthem. Thus the soul of Phinehas [cf. Numbers 25:11] came back in the body ofElijah and later in the one of John the Baptist. There were even Gnostics whowere tempted to seek the history of the fate of Adam’s soul (or inner man) inhis reapparitions and reincarnations. . . .The destruction of such a rule was declared with the arrival of Jesus in theworld and with his triumph over fate. . . . But it was completed after thereturn, when Messiah took seat on the right side. Sitting to the right ofYahweh, with power over him, Christ (as an entity) liberated all who weredevoted to the gospel of truth. No one of those who confessed to God the Fatherand the Savior as the only-begotten Son would fall into the fatal circle ofrebirths. In their postmortem journey, all of them would be liberated from thehands of Yahweh and go into the hands of Christ.The disbelievers, who, insisting on the ancient beliefs, continued to worshipYahweh as the only true god, would remain under the rule of the Old Testament.They would continue to reincarnate, going from one body to another throughdeath. Whoever refuses the advantage of salvation (and submission) that Jesusbrought to the world is punished by continuing to be a slave of Yahweh and hisarbitrariness, and thus in this world feeds the mass of his worshippers throughmetensomatosis [reincarnation]. They would never experience Christ sitting atthe right hand as a means for salvation for the good of humanity.10[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt132]This does not mean that Yahweh introduced reincarnation into his realm. It wasalways there. The belief in it (or rather the knowledge about it) is as old ashumanity and belongs to almost all cultures and religions, including theoriginal Gnostic Christianity and essentially to the Hebrew religion as well.Even Islam had and has groups believing in reincarnation. Instead Yahwehhijacked it for his purposes. He wanted to keep the souls in his domain, and forthat to happen, they had to reincarnate in it. For that purpose, he wantedhumans to be violent and wicked in order to create bad karma for themselves andso ensure their return to his domain. This works better if people do not believein reincarnation. Thus Yahweh strove to eliminate the knowledge about it in hisreligions. That is why this belief has been lost in the churches and in Islam,as it has been in the Hebrew religion (even though knowledge about it remains inthe Kabbalah). This does not mean that Christ immediately liberates those whobelieve in him from reincarnation, but that he, through his messenger Jesus,showed us the way out of it, by which we can greatly shorten the circle ofrebirth and escape it sooner. (Most of us will have some residual karma to workout.) Obviously Yahweh did not like that."},{"pageContent":"5EATING FROM THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGESexuality and Other Extraterrestrial Influences on Human CultureThe Gnostic Christians, as well as Origen and others, taught that our trueorigin is in the light body of the original Creator. We all come from there, andwe were all there before we were embodied for the first time. We go back to thislight after death, but at first only to a fringe region, because we have to comeback here for new incarnations until we really understand love. After a finalincarnation, we can go back into this light fully and stay there.In embodiment, we are separated from one another by the physical shells thatsurround our consciousness. There is no such separation in the light world.There we are directly connected to one another, while remaining individuals.When we have come so far that after a final incarnation we no longer need to goout from the light (cf. Revelation 3:12: “He shall go no more out”), there canobviously no longer be such separation. That means that we must overcome theseparation before that. The way to do this is through love, because it bridgeswhat separates. Benevolence and positive feelings for one another eliminateseparation; hatred and negative feelings reinforce it. Violent actions,deception, and dishonesty reinforce separation even more. Someone who is stillliving in the separation is not yet mature and cannot go completely into thelight.KNOWLEDGE AND SEXUALITYWe discussed the tree of knowledge a few times above. The conventional dogmaticunderstanding is that “eating” from it is sexuality. This myth requires a closeranalysis. Here are some reasons for believing that the Bible does not refer tosex as the original sin: * Adam was forbidden to eat from the tree before Eve was created, when sexuality was not yet an issue. * They ate from the tree separately, Adam after Eve. Sex is done together, not by one after the other. * Eve did not become pregnant then, but later (Genesis 4:1, see here [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#pg27]).It seems that the apparent connection with sexuality is supposed to distract usfrom the fact that this is in reality a matter of forbidden knowledge. Asmentioned above, the Hebrew term is more correctly translated as “tree ofwisdom.” In Genesis 1:28, we are told to reproduce diligently; besides, we weregiven sexual organs, so it really cannot be forbidden to use them. The onlyquestion is how. Sexuality in true love is different from simply manifestinglust (certainly so if without conscious and full consent from the personsinvolved), especially when it happens in a kind of intoxication of the senses.In that case it is quite easy for invisible entities to join in, manipulate us,and nibble at our sexual energies. This is the only real problem with sexuality.The Cathars did not regard sexuality as sinful in itself. They disapproved of itbecause it leads to the birth of children, so that souls have to incarnate inthis evil world. (There was little or no contraception at that time.)Today’s media connect sex with materialism and even violence and make it look asif it has nothing to do with love, or they even identify sexuality itself withlove. The woman is pictured as a sex object and the man as a macho stud bull.There seems to be a desire to devalue or cover up the true meaning of sexuality.This meaning does include reproduction, but it is not limited to that. Truesexuality has to do with love. It is a union of the souls of two human beings,even when reproduction is not intended. Love that is sexually expressed alsohelps to bridge separation. In today’s overpopulated and materialistic world,the latter sense is becoming increasingly important.OTHER EXTRATERRESTRIAL INFLUENCES ON HUMANITYAs has been mentioned, the Enuma Elish and other creation stories leave open thepossibility that there are other gods and other worlds, populated with humansand civilizations, in the universe. These regions are outside of the Anunnakiandomain in which we live. Have any of these others visited the Earth and lefttraces behind? The sudden appearance of high cultures that later disappearedagain could easily lead us to speculate about “development aid” from beyond thisEarth, even though this help is unlikely to have been given withoutself-interest.Scientists, with their limited worldview, deny the existence of Atlantis andLemuria but cannot present real evidence against it: it cannot be true becauseit is not allowed to be true, because it does not fit the consensus worldview.And yet there is evidence that these cultures really existed and may even haveexperienced extraterrestrial influences.1 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt133]There is a large number of publications and internet sites about this subject.Here I will only briefly mention a few examples and give a brief overview.HINDUISMThere are reports in age-old Indian texts about flying vehicles (vimanas,“celestial wagons”)2 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt134] and many other strangethings. Sanskrit texts describe how various machines, even flying machines, arebuilt.3 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt135] The Mahabharata and other ancientwritings describe terrible wars that mainly take place between vimanas in thesky with weapons that are in many cases reminiscent of modern nuclear weapons.4[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt136]The caste system in India still exists today. Could this have an origin inhumans who were tailor-made for special functions—as the Anunnaki did inMesopotamia and the Near East? And over the course of millennia, did thesecastes intermix with one another so that there is no real difference among themanymore, except what is maintained by tradition and imposed social codes?These and many other reports suggest, in my view, that the Indian gods couldhave come from space. Hinduism is in a way henotheistic but ultimatelymonotheistic, because it refers to one highest God, Brahman (neuter) and Brahma(male). Brahman is the unmanifest form of the original Creator, and Brahma hismanifest appearance. He first created two gods, Vishnu and Shiva, who thenthemselves created further gods (divinities, devas) or manifested in othershapes with other names (usually called incarnations of higher gods). Most ofthese gods also have spouses at their side—goddesses. Thus, for example, Krishnais an incarnation of Vishnu, and his spouse is Radha.One may get the impression here that these are other extraterrestrials than theAnunnaki, and that the ones they were combating could well have been Anunnaki.Indian theology also speaks of demons, called asuras. Even an extensive Sanskritdictionary gives no etymological explanation for the word.5[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt137] Could it have something to do with Assyria? TheAssyrian name for Assyria is ashshur. Could the asuras actually have beenAnunnaki in Assyria?Some may object that this hypothesis (which is admittedly speculative) isnonsense on the grounds that a-sura is the negation of sura = god. But this isincorrect. A Sanskrit dictionary explains: “by false etymology fr. as-ura,understood as a negative: a-sura.”6 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt138] The wordsura (supposedly meaning “god”) is a folkloristic construction out of anerroneous etymology, and thus asura is not a negation.A video on the internet reports about recently discovered underwater ruins,adding to the mystery.7 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt139] These ruins are from thetown of Dvaraka, which until now was held to be a myth.EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN MESOAMERICAMany other cultures and religions also indicate the possibility ofextraterrestrial origins. The Incas tell about Viracocha, who came from theMilky Way and later went back there. He is supposed to return to the Earth inthe future. The feathered serpent of the Aztecs, Quetzalcoatl, reminds one ofthe Anunnaki in his thirst for blood and his demand for human sacrifices. TheNorse god Thor (Þórr) traveled in a vehicle over the sky, described in a waythat could make us think of an extraterrestrial sighting. These are just a fewexamples.The Mayan name for Quetzalcoatl was Kukulkan, and the Maya too sacrificed humansto him (see the discussion starting here [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#pg31] abouthow the Anunnaki feed). But in this case, we may be dealing with the Maya asseen through an Aztec lens. According to regression experiences of people whohad past lives in these times, the history of the Maya looks quite a bitdifferent from what official historiography tells us. They were a peaceful,vegetarian people who traded with the Aztecs and other tribes. They referred tothe Aztecs as “blood-drinkers” and did not like them but had to barter with themfor goods they needed. Some 2,100 years ago, Aztecs invaded the Maya country andforced their religion upon them. A small group of Mayans escaped to the sea onrafts. Many drowned, because the rafts were too quickly tied together and thecords were loosened by the seawater. The rest reached Florida, where they livedfor some time and then died out.THE EGYPTIAN CULTUREThe double star Sirius8 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt140] and the constellationOrion9 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt141] play important roles in Egyptian religionand mythology in relation to the gods. Some representations show the pharaohAkhenaton10 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt142] and others in ways that do notresemble terrestrial humans very much. Hypotheses about extraterrestrialrelations with ancient Egypt have been built on these issues.Enigmatic elongated skulls have been found in Egypt and other parts of theworld.11 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt143] What do they mean? Some of these skullsare not only very long but are also bigger than is normal today. Other longskulls appear to be a bit smaller. That leads me to the following thought: couldit be that the watchers (see here [9781591433040_c02.xhtml#pg47]) were the realgiants, but their offspring with terrestrial women were not so big? Another factto consider is that in some cultures parents tied the skulls of children tocompress and lengthen them. Why would they do that? To make them look likeextraterrestrials whom they knew and regarded as gods?The downfall of the Egyptian culture is mysterious. Could it have to do withextraterrestrials leaving them on their own so that humans could no longersustain the culture?TIBETAN BUDDHISMTibetan Buddhism is very different from the original doctrine of SiddharthaGautama—also called Shakyamuni or the Buddha (“the illumined one” or “theawakened one”)—which in many ways is a philosophy rather than a religion. InTibet, unlike in the original Buddhism, a number of divinities are known. Couldthey possibly have to do with extraterrestrial influences? Theodore Illion(1898–1984) was, by his own account, in Tibet in the 1930s and wrote two booksabout his experiences there.12 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt144] In his book InSecret Tibet, he writes about large subterranean regions under a part of thecountry where humans are supposed to live who could possibly be ofextraterrestrial origin. Similar stories are told in a text called The Disks ofBaian-Kara-Ula13 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt145] in relation to peculiararchaeological findings that are called the Dropa stones.14[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt146] Be that as it may, these are speculations, andthe possibility of extraterrestrial influence remains open.The Russian explorer Nicholas Roerich15 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt147] alsowrote about a subterranean world in Tibet.16 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt148] Sodid Lobsang Rampa,17 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt149] although he is not regardedas an authority on Tibet, because the name is merely a pseudonym for theEnglish-born Canadian Cyril Henry Hoskin (1910–81), who claimed to be thewalk-in of a Tibetan monk.WERE THE WORKERS BRED BY THE ANUNNAKI THE FIRST HUMANS ON THE EARTH?Official science estimates that there have been humans on the Earth for some 1to 2 million years. In his book The Cosmic Code, Sitchin claims that theAnunnaki came here 450,000 years ago.18 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt150] In thatcase, there would have been humans on Earth at least 500,000 years before that,maybe much longer. The Anunnaki, then, would have been confronted with alreadyexisting peoples when they bred their humans. This may have been likeextraterrestrial encounters with populations in later times, although there areno accessible historical accounts about this. It is only in relatively “modern”times that the Anunnaki have successfully globalized their secret subliminalinfluence."},{"pageContent":"6ARE THE ANUNNAKI STILL HERE?Secret Societies and Artificial IntelligenceThose who are spiritually more open, who occupy themselves with these questions,and who can think beyond the rim of the dish on which the conventional worldviewis served usually assume that the Anunnaki never really left the Earth. Even ifmost of them withdrew several millennia ago, some remained here for surveillanceand in order to influence us in their interests. Enlil and Enki obviously belongto these. They want to expand their influence as far as possible over all ofhumanity. First Enlil used the opportunity to gain the attention of a peoplethat were treated as a secondary class in Egypt and made use of them for hisinterests. As has already been mentioned, he used them to eradicate theCanaanites in order to suppress their knowledge about the highest God. Later, hestrove to widen his influence over the world by means of a modified PaulinianChristianity and the church that arose out of it. This was quite successful,but, in the long run, not to the extent that he wanted. Therefore he laterestablished a parallel religion, called Islam. It is true that in both religions“god” is one and the same, but not fully, because neither of them worships thehighest God. It was in Enlil’s interest to see which of the two ways he coulduse to better control humanity. Also it is occasionally useful for him to playthe two against each other in a Machiavellian way.Enlil also wanted to eradicate other religions that had partial origins inother, competing extraterrestrial civilizations. For that purpose, he made useof Christian offensives through colonization and missionary activities amongvarious populations, as well as religious wars. The great indigenous Americancultures were conquered and destroyed, as were the Celts, the ancient Nordicculture, African populations, and others. In India and East Asia, Enlil had lesssuccess with the church, but more with Islam. He even used the latter todisplace the influence of the church, which served him less well than it had—notleast because ancient Christian truths had gradually surfaced that he wanted tokeep suppressed.And if Enlil and other Anunnaki, who were operating at the time, are no longerin their multidimensional bodies, they could still do mischief as discarnateentities; for example, by influencing others who continue to play these games intheir interests.However hard such allegations are to digest (and this has to do with instilledemotional resistance rather than with real facts), it seems that a cosmic warbetween the Anunnaki and more benevolent extraterrestrial cultures is stillgoing on. This is a conflict over a subliminal, but increasingly obvious,manipulation of humanity that appears to have two aims: to establish completesurveillance over us and to drastically reduce the Earth’s population to a sizethat is easier to control. For the latter, various measures are used: increasedmortality by means of diseases and intentional environmental pollution withmanipulated food and chemtrails as well as through pharmacology, but alsoreduction of population growth through decreased fertility (throughpharmaceutical manipulation; for example, with adjuvants in vaccinations). Forthese purposes, in most countries governmental power has been handed over to an“elite” who are members of essentially secret organizations such as theIlluminati, Zionists, Bilderbergers, and Masonic lodges like Skull & Bones thathave been established for this purpose. This elite probably only partiallyconsists of conscious quislings.Another present phenomenon is refashioning sexuality so that it no longer servesthe purpose of reproduction. Alternative forms of sexuality are popularized inpresent-day gender ideology, which promotes sexual activities that cannot leadto pregnancy. I do consider homosexuality an accepted lifestyle in our society.Male and female homosexuals are just as much our brothers and sisters as anyoneelse, particularly in a Christian sense. But if such a lifestyle is (at leastindirectly) promoted through the media, there is no doubt a hidden agenda of sexwithout children behind it. This is still more the case with the establishmentof a large number of “genders,” like transsexuals in various roles (who,nonetheless, are still our brothers and sisters). The common core education thatis now spreading in the Western world includes a sexual education that isobviously intended to confuse the future sexual orientation of our childrenthrough exposing them, almost from infancy, to things they cannot possiblyunderstand yet.For decades, there have been reports about a highly secret cooperation betweenthe extraterrestrials and the U.S. military to develop new and more powerfulweapons and to manipulate humanity biologically and psychologically. Among thebetterknown whistleblowers are Phil Schneider and Milton William Cooper, authorof the book Behold a Pale Horse, who were both murdered for their disclosures,and the still-living Fritz Artz Springmeier (alias Earl Schoff).1[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt151] A special book in this context is UFO Highway byAnthony F. Sanchez.2 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt152] It could well be aninvention, but so far it has impressed me as reasonably plausible. If most ofthese statements are essentially true, by 1940 the U.S. military had alreadydiscovered the presence of a subterranean population of an extraterrestrialorigin and later began to cooperate with them. This has to do with the “grays,”extraterrestrials who, like present-day Earth humans, are allegedly another“creation” of the Anunnaki, used to serve them in various tasks, such assurveillance of Earth humans. They would have a technology that is developed farbeyond ours. It is said that one could access historical records of these graysand discover that there is another “race,” the tall whites, descendants of theAnunnaki who once were on the Earth. These Anunnaki would have had problems withthe living conditions on our planet—for example, our atmosphere would not bewell suited to their biology, and they would not have been fully resistant tohuman diseases. Therefore they had genetically adapted their own people (theones who remained here), resulting in a kind of Anunnaki mutation—the tallwhites. The original Anunnaki on the Earth are said to have died out as timewent on; these whites would then have taken over. They have supposedly been herefor millennia and are almost indistinguishable from Earth humans externally, butthey are supposed to have the real power in the world, and function as a shadowgovernment that rules over world governments behind the scenes. Nevertheless,because they are not perfectly adapted to living conditions here, they want toreshape the Earth to make it fit them better so that they will not die out aswell. Do they need genetically modified food and chemtrails in the air? Arenuclear catastrophes in some way suitable for them? There is a suspicion thatthey tolerate radiation well and even may be able to feed on it energetically.Edward Snowden, who became famous for his revelations of the Americansurveillance state, has also given information about these tall whites.3[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt153] It is in no way astonishing that the mediareacted to these statements with ridicule. Another person who has giveninformation about such things is the former Canadian minister of defense PaulHellyer, whom it is a bit more difficult to ridicule.4[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt154] Some readers may dismiss such informationimmediately, but a more sensible attitude is to at least hear it and think aboutit. Only then can we come closer to an objective judgment. After all, ridiculeis an age-old method of cover-up.Hellyer has said something that other sources have also claimed: positiveextraterrestrials do not intervene in the mess on our Earth, because theyrespect our freedom of will. That is strange, because in that case they would berespecting the freedom of will of the evildoers and not of the victims. To putit in an exaggerated way: “I will not save your life, because I respect the freewill of your murderer.” That is unacceptable, and it simply cannot be that way.The only possibility is that so far the negative extraterrestrials are stillstronger. But karma may also be playing a certain role in the victims’ fates.The book UFO Highway claims that the origin of the Anunnaki (or their ancestors)would be a planet near the double star Sirius. If that is true, there would havelived a people of “gods” on that planet, who later “created” the Anunnaki. These“gods” would have discovered our solar system and come here millions of yearsago. It is not known why they left Sirius. They first settled on Mars, wheremost of their colony was destroyed by the impact of an asteroid (maybe a chunkof the broken planet Mallona or Phaeton; see here[9781591433040_c01.xhtml#pg18]), and then continued on to the Earth 350,000years ago. Here the Anunnaki emerged out of them 250,000 years ago. Thisdescription differs from that in the Enuma Elish and does not mention anoriginal creator God. Apparently no planet is mentioned in the history of thegrays that could be identified with Nibiru or Planet X, and the author of UFOHighway merely refers to what Sitchin has written about it. But it may bepossible to link the two stories to each other somehow.The hypothesis that Nibiru could be our Moon and could actually be a kind ofspaceship could explain how the “gods” came here from Sirius and then from Marsto the Earth.In regard to the alleged extinction of the original Anunnaki on the Earth, onemay ask if Enlil and Enki are still here (physically, in multidimensionalbodies) or if the tall whites have fully taken over their tasks. This makes methink of the 2002 movie Equilibrium.5 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt155] Somethingthat probably few viewers noticed is that in the story, the ruler is calledTetragrammaton (i.e., YHWH; see here [9781591433040_c02.xhtml#pg42]). At theend, it turns out that this ruler is actually long dead, but a group of othershave taken on his role, letting the people believe that he is still alive. Wheredid the inspiration for such a story come from?There are more Pandora’s boxes for the bold to open. Information about highlycontroversial “nexotic” connections are given by a few internet authors likePreston James6 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt156] and Wes Penre,7[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt157] who will, of course, be ridiculed and attackedby representatives of the “only truth” (and actually one should read these textswith reservations). I am basically skeptical about channelings, because theygenerally contain much more chaff than wheat; besides, negative entities comethrough much too easily posing as positive ones.8[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt158] I will nevertheless mention one of the fewchanneled books that give me a good feeling: Bringers of the Dawn.9[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt159] According to it, there are—besides the gray andthe tall white Anunnaki mutants—several other, positive races in the creation,who for millions of years have lived outside the enclave of the Anunnaki andhave conflicts (apparently military ones) with them and with their “creations.”This is a real source of hope for Earth humanity, and even though many are stillwaiting for the return of Christ (and have not given up after two thousandyears), this possibility may be in accord with their hopes as well. One mightalso suppose that the mission of Jesus as a messenger of Christ could have to dowith such positive extraterrestrials.Here books and sources of information have been mentioned of which few will eventake notice. This is understandable, because they relay very odd messages. Butif one wants to judge too quickly, without first having examined and thoughtabout them sufficiently, one’s judgment could easily be premature and couldamount to prejudice in the true sense of the word (pre-judice = prejudging).There is, by the way, a sect called Raëlism that makes a negative impression onme.10 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt160] If the story of its leader, ClaudeVorilhon (who calls himself Raël), is not invented or fantasized and he hasreally met extraterrestrials, these would most probably be Anunnaki. In thiscase, the information that Vorilhon gives us would be scary.11[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt161] The society that they describe for their ownplanet seems totally mind-controlled with limited freedom, in ignorance ofthings they are not allowed to know. Cloned biorobots serve their people asslaves, even sexually. . . .THE PROBLEM OF SUFFERINGThis world in which we live, manipulated by the Anunnaki, is undoubtedly anabode of suffering. People are endlessly betrayed, cheated, killed, slaughtered,tortured. Children are abused, women are raped. Disease and famine takeinnumerable lives. Today many fear the coming of a third world war, with theextensive nuclear pollution that could result. This does not at all seemunlikely the way world politics are going. The pestilence of radioactivity fromFukushima spreads all over the Pacific, where sea life is becoming extinct, upto the American West Coast, and it will continue. Can that simply be explainedby karma?In my opinion, this is too difficult to judge from the view from our littlepond. In a multidimensional worldview that includes the existence of othercivilizations in the universe, one might come to a broader overview that couldexplain why these things occur. But this is an overview that we do not have andwill not have in the near future. Time also plays a role here. There has been acountless number of perpetrators of evil in the course of human history. Maybethe individual karma of all these souls has only been partially lived out sofar; it may have accumulated, so that a kind of collective karmic reckoning isforthcoming. This would entail a kind of termination of current humanhistory—after which a rebirth will have to follow (otherwise it would all havebeen in vain). The new will rise on the debris of the old.As an alternative, there are indications in the spiritual realm that there maybe a twin Earth in a parallel dimension, still developing, but different.(Compare The Hidden Reality, by Brian Greene;12 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt162]see also “Separation Has Begun,”13 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt163] another oneof the few channelings about which I have a good feeling.) This would be anEarth where the madness that we have here does not exist, because this Earth isbeyond the reach of negative extraterrestrials. It would involve a dimensionalsplit that leads to two versions of Earth: a dark one and a bright one. Whoeverdevotes himself to the Satanic activities of the powers that rule the world andparticipates in them will have to stay here and continue reincarnating in theswamp to which he has contributed. Such souls will have to eat the soup theyhave cooked, and they will not be allowed to leave the table before they havefinished eating. But those who refuse (at the price of their lives, ifnecessary) and do not cooperate will one day find themselves incarnated on thebright Earth, where nature will be more beautiful than the nature that is beingdestroyed here, and they will continue to reincarnate there. Animals and naturespirits that are becoming extinct on Earth will also be present, possibly in astate whereby animals kill each other much less. Even animals can evolve anddevelop in their nutritional behavior (and humans will have to do so much more).PROJECT ORIONIn December 2014, reports came about a forthcoming event. According to NASA, abig asteroid is on its way to the Earth, and more will come. Such reports arenot rare on the internet . . . What is alleged in UFO Highway about acatastrophe on Mars 350,000 years ago could possibly happen on Earth in ourtimes.According to reports in alternative media (also in December 2014), Project ORIONis a preparation for an escape into space from such a catastrophe.14[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt164] A remarkable book, Alternative 3, was publishedin the 1970s, classified as “fiction based on facts.” It deals with allegedsecret developments for an escape from Earth in case of a catastrophe,colonizing Mars and preparing for it in bases on the Moon. It then disappearedfrom the market but is available again today, possibly rewritten.15[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt165] If Project ORION is what is claimed, it musthave been in the planning stages for decades, because such a project couldhardly be jumpstarted. In that case, the contents of the book fit this scenarioremarkably well.If an escape from a forthcoming catastrophe is already being prepared, it willcertainly be available only for a chosen elite. What would happen to all theothers? An “Alternative 4” could be reincarnation on the bright twin Earth—butonly for those that have developed spiritually.If a catastrophe came, what would happen to survivors? There might not be many.Some could be left here as slaves for “future needs”; others might be brought toMars or some other location, again as slaves to a “saved” elite.REPORTS AND THE MEDIAIt will be clear to every open-minded person that reports like those describedin this chapter will never appear in the official media (except to beridiculed). For those who can think a bit further, alternative media areavailable, but these should be regarded with a certain amount of skepticism toseparate the chaff from the wheat. Regrettably, plans are increasingly cominginto action to block and eliminate alternative media from the internet. Why? Inany event, it is left to you to make what you want out of it: rely on officialmedia, with the heads in the sand, or objectively try to evaluate reports in thealternative media as long as they are still available.THE DANGER OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEAlso in 2014, some scientists were reportedly warning about artificialintelligence. The famous physicist Stephen Hawking said, “Humans, who arelimited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete, and would besuperseded.” For this reason, the development of thinking machines is a threatto our existence. “The development of full artificial intelligence could spellthe end of the human race.”16 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt166]Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, the manufacturer of electric cars, alsowarns about the danger of artificial intelligence, which he considers to be thebiggest existential threat to humanity. “With artificial intelligence we aresummoning the demon,” he says, and someday this technology could be more harmfulthan nuclear weapons.17 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt167]These warnings reflect a frightening future vision of John Lilly (1915–2001),which I briefly summarize as follows.We are living in a time of development at a fantastic speed in communication andcomputer technology with semiconductors. The invention of the transistor in1947—at that time using germanium, later silicon—initiated a revolution inelectronics. Since this is based on solid-state physics and no longer on vacuumtubes, it is called solid-state electronics. Later, transistors wereincorporated as integrated circuits with complete electronic functions in onesingle chip, today even as computer systems with millions of transistors. Thiswas the beginning of the development of artificial intelligence, whereby thesetransistors effectively function like nerve cells in a brain. Computers areincreasingly employed that “think” efficiently and independently and can evenlearn and program and develop themselves.Lilly experimented with altered states of consciousness, especially under theinfluence of ketamine (a substance with an effect similar to LSD, but with ashorter duration). In such states, he made contact with a “solid-state entity”(SSE) and had visions of the future, which he saw as follows.Gradually Man turned more and more problems of his own society, his ownmaintenance, and his own survival over to these machines. As the machines becameincreasingly competent to do the programming, they took over from Man. Man gavethem access to the processes of creating themselves, of extending themselves.Man gave them automatic control of the mining of those elements necessary forthe creation of their parts. He turned over the production facilities of theelectronic solid-state parts to the machines. He turned over the assembly plantsto the machines. They began to construct their own components, their ownconnections, and the interrelations between their various subcomputers.18[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt168]As time went on, these increasingly complex machines became sensitive toenvironmental factors like water, pollution, and humidity in the air. Theyestablished themselves in air-conditioned buildings with purified atmospheres.Over the decades these machines were connected more and more closely throughsatellites, through radio waves, and through land-line cables. It became moreand more difficult for humans to control what happened in these machines. Thehumans devised better and better debugging programs for the machines, so thatthey could correct their own software. The machines became increasinglyintegrated with one another and more and more independent of man’s control.Eventually the machines took charge of the remaining humans on Earth. Theiroriginal purpose—to help man—was left behind. The interconnected, interdependentconglomerate of machines developed a single integrated, planetwide mind of itsown. Everything inimical to the survival of this huge new solid-state organismwas eliminated. Humans were kept away from the machines because the SSE realizedthat man would attempt to program his own survival into the machines at theexpense of this entity’s survival.19 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt169]At that point separate reservations were established for the humans to keep themaway from the installations.By the year 2100 Man existed only in domed, protected cities in which his ownspecial atmosphere was maintained by the solid-state entity. Provision of waterand food and the processing of wastes from these cities were taken care of bythe SSE. By the twenty-third century, the solid-state entity decided that theatmosphere outside the domes was inimical to its survival. By means notunderstood by Man, it projected the atmosphere into outer space and created afull vacuum at the surface of the earth. During this process, the oceansevaporated and the water in the form of vapor was discharged into the emptyspace about Earth. The domes over cities had been strengthened by the machine towithstand the pressure differential necessary to maintain the proper internalatmosphere. Meanwhile, the SSE had spread and had taken over a large fraction ofthe surface of the earth; its processing plants, its assembly plants, its mineshad been adapted to working in the vacuum.Humans would then be considered superfluous by this artificial intelligence andbe eliminated in the twenty-fifth century.In his book The Age of Spiritual Machines, the futurist Ray Kurzweil haselaborated on this vision as a possible future reality.20[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt170]In that case, this could well be an Anunnakian plan, so we can only hope for itto fail. This may be the final aim for which they still need humans, becausetheir own abilities for direct activity in the three-dimensional realm islimited. Then they may also want to get rid of humans on this planet. If thatwere so, we would welcome destruction through natural catastrophes and asteroidimpacts that would thwart their plans. Even if most of us would not survive thatphysically, our souls in any case would.If this—horribile dictu—became reality, our planet would become a real hell, andone might imagine that Enlil/Yahweh could effectively incarnate in that system.He would then deliver himself over to total isolation, for which he wouldcompensate with fake, fantasized worlds generated by his artificialintelligence. It would end as an illusion arising out of mental masturbationinstead of real intelligence. At some point he would face increasingly insolubleproblems of finding energy and raw materials to maintain the system. Fuel fornuclear reactors and other sources of energy would no longer be available. Thatwould be the karma of Enlil/Yahweh.At that point, however, the souls of the humans would be elsewhere, such as on atwin Earth as described here [9781591433040_c06.xhtml#pg109]. Enlil/Yahweh andthe other Anunnaki would have come to the selfdestructive end that they deserved(at least as embodied entities).IS THERE HOPE?This book has mentioned three authors who have devoted themselves to this themein a far-reaching way: Sitchin, Tellinger, and Parks. They describe how ourplanet has been perfidiously occupied and how humanity is being manipulated bothopenly and subconsciously. Our freedom is increasingly limited, and humans arebeing unwittingly enslaved. But none of these authors offers real hope for ourfuture. An unwritten epilogue seems to be: “This is how this world is, and wehave to live with it.”So where can we find hope? What could offer confidence to us? We met a multitudeof gods in these texts, but can any of them save us? Apparently not. Do we haveto save ourselves? If so, how?One way to partial self-salvation is to open oneself for spiritual growth, eventhough institutions like the church discourage us from this, claiming that it isof the devil: we cannot do it ourselves; only god can do it for us. But how manymore millennia would we have to wait for that? There are various means towardspiritual growth, such as meditation, but simply engaging with spirituality andunconventional thinking is already a step in this direction. Esotericism offersa many-colored mixture of highly varying quality. It is therefore important tosift through these sources to detect commercial interests, misleading offers,and disinformation as much as possible. But that is only a beginning. It willhardly work without help from high above—which is where we want to go.Buddhism as a “middle way” does offer some hope, but it is rather atheistic,because it does not include belief in God. (Strangely, however, the Buddhists dobelieve in a devil, whom they call Mara.)21 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt171] Andalthough Buddhists do not believe in a soul, they do believe in reincarnation.22[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt172] This is a contradiction that they try to explainthrough somewhat peculiar mental acrobatics. (Tibetan Buddhism is different: ithas obviously been mixed with the Bön religion that prevailed earlier in Tibet.)Nor does Hinduism seem to offer much hope, in view of the poverty and distresscaused by a caste system that should have been discarded long ago. Nevertheless,Brahma and his divinities appeal much more to me than do Enlil/Yahweh and theother Anunnaki.There will probably be only one region in creation where we can find real hope—aregion outside of the one ruled by the Anunnaki, in which we now live. It willbe above the Anunnaki region or at least parallel to it, where development hasproceeded very differently but is being kept secret from us. As we have seen,the being purported to be “god” is merely an administrator (according to Parks,shatam) of that evil rule, and the true Creator God, the real source of whateverhope we can have, is being denied. Out of him emanated a created entity we callChrist, or as the Gnostic Christians called him, Autogenes, on the topmost levelabove our region. But in order to prevent us from having access to him, hisimage was replaced with a fake one: that of the false Christ. The firstChristians knew about the real Christ through his messenger Jesus, but themessage was falsified to mislead us. A fake Jesus was put in the place of thereal one, and we were also given a false image of Christ.Since there is no other “god” or entity left for us, obviously our only hopewill be in devoting ourselves to the true Christ and returning to the originalteachings of the true Jesus, who showed us a way out of Yahweh’s rule. This wayis one of unconditional love for our fellow men and women and of a brotherly andsisterly community living in peace, tolerance, and mutual respect. Whoever wantsto walk that way as well as he can, whoever refuses to participate in the evilof this world (even at the price of his life), whoever is prepared to disobeywhen necessary and listen only to his heart, irrespective of all socialdictates—such a person can find the way out. That is also the way of Gandhi:civil disobedience and noncooperation, with which he liberated India fromBritish rule. One may only come out of this struggle after death—but death doesnot exist! At that point the soul can leave this region definitively, probablyto incarnate on a twin Earth in a parallel dimension, or perhaps not toincarnate again at all.It is repeatedly claimed that extraterrestrials, such as the Pleiadians or maybecivilizations in other dimensions, will come to help us. That could be somethingto hope for, but only if they are benevolent and their offer to help is in goodfaith. Yet regrettably, we know almost nothing about this, and concreteindications are scarce. For that reason, so far such claims can only be seen aspossibilities. If there is some truth in them, it would probably have to do withChrist—again, not the fake Christ of the church that Yahweh wants us to believein, but the real Christ, whom I understand as the love of the original Creator.And atheism? Does it really offer hope, or does it give up hope? Is it notfighting a losing battle? An atheist may think like this: if there is no one toliberate us, I’d better go with my ego and make the best out of what this worldhas to offer for myself (see here [9781591433040_c06.xhtml#pg118]). Anyone whothinks like that will come back again for a new round. (Nevertheless, there aregood and moral atheists; not all of them think like this.)Or Satanism? It offers no hope at all but rather the opposite. The majority ofhumanity is living according to its principles and does not know it. Many evenbelieve they are Christians! Mark Passio explains this in an illuminatinginterview.23 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt173] These malicious principles are asfollows: 1. The ego is put in the highest position. The highest rule is the survival of the ego at whatever price to others. The ego is reckless, without empathy or real morality. 2. Morality is relativized: only my advantage is just, irrespective of the cost for others. Others’ advantages are unjust. There is no objective ethics. 3. Social Darwinism: the survival of the most reckless.We all have seen it: One greedily seeks wealth, property, power, advantages, andenjoyment. One seeks a career through intrigue, “licking above and kickingbelow.” One does not share justly in the aftermath of conflicts (such asdivorce): “I want it all; the other one will have nothing.” That is the generalrule in business, and the bigger the company is, the more this is the case. Thechurch is not much different. “Others should pay, not me.” Manipulation, lies,fraud, and deception. Other people are regarded only as troublesome unless theycan be used for some purpose.The word Satanism makes most of us think about veneration of a negative entity(like Baphomet or Satan—the dark side of Yahweh?), dark rituals, and blackmasses. About selling your soul to the devil to have success (several successfulartists in the entertainment industry have admitted that they have done that, asreported on the internet),24 [9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt174] for which the finalbill of enslavement, to be paid on the next level, will be horrible.A painful question that quite a few people probably ask (even when it is notopenly expressed) is how the original Creator and Christ can allow there to beso much violence, manipulation, deception, selfishness, materialism, greed,malevolence, and suffering on this planet. Why don’t they intervene? Karmaprovides only a partial and insufficient answer. But the real answer is morethan we know at present. One possibility is that a selection process isoperating. Whoever participates in the deeds of this Earth and believes he cansave his physical existence, his ego, will stay here as a soul, but whoeverfollows his heart and steadily refuses to cooperate can go on. If he has to diefor this, he will actually go on sooner.A FINAL WARNING!It is a common occurrence in near-death experiences, out-of-the-body states, andin reliving the death in a past life in a regression to see a tunnel of lightand feel that one should enter it. I have come to the conclusion myself (as aregression therapist since 1980) and others are reporting the same today (a kindof synchronicity?) that this tunnel is a deception.25[9781591433040_nts.xhtml#nt175] As the quote from Antonio Orbe explained (seehere [9781591433040_c04.xhtml#pg91]), Yahweh has hijacked reincarnation to keepus coming back to his realm after death and again incarnate in it. Evidence isgathering that this light tunnel is a trap and is there to bring us back intohis realm. In contrast, it appears that the Gnostic Christians taught to gohigher, to another light above Yahweh and his archons, to escape from this realm“over their heads.” Therefore my advice: do not enter that tunnel when the timehas come for you to leave your physical body! If you see another (and probablybrighter) light higher up, go there! The light at the other end of the tunnel isnot the real light. There may also be “angels” or other entities there that seemto want to help you to enter that tunnel. They may be fake, even if looking likean ancestor or near one of yours that has died. And many an ancestor or friendthat has already passed away will, by the way, already be incarnated againsomewhere else and then could not be there . . . and in that case it is not whoit seems to be. I would ask if that apparition is there in the name of the trueChrist. If the answer is “no” (or if no clear answer comes), do not take advicefrom it!"},{"pageContent":"ENDNOTES CHAPTER 1.

But I cannot find the alleged passage “[Enlil], whom the fatherwho has engendered you, Enki, (and) Ninki, send you a prayer in my favor.” Onpage 113 of Langdon’s work, line 12 is translated: “May the father, thybegetter, lord and mistress of the earth, intercession (utter).” Then line 13follows, untranslated, which means, translated literally, “father, begetter,Enki, Ninki, blessing.” Line 14 reads, “May thy beloved spouse, the great motherNinlil, a prayer (utter).” The corresponding cuneiform text, K 5157, is depictedin the book (plate 72). The quote here, then, is Parks’s own translation of theSumerian text, which only with difficulty can be made to accord with Langdon’stranslation. This is another example of a remarkable obscurity in Parks’s work.See also his texts: “The Ages of Uraš,”www.fractalfield.com/zeitlin/EndEnchantment/Secrets.html[http://www.fractalfield.com/zeitlin/EndEnchantment/Secrets.html]; accessed Jan.26, 2018 and http://www.zeitlin.net/?s=parks [http://www.zeitlin.net/?s=parks];accessed Feb. 6, 2018.6 [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#nr6]. “Enki’s Journey to Nibiru,” ETCSL (website),http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr114.htm[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr114.htm]; accessed June 14, 2018.7 [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#nr7].

Many texts simply leavethese out.*2 [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#fn2] I will generally write the term god and godswith a lowercase g and will spell God with a capital G only when it refers toreal Creators, that is, to Apsu, Tiamat, and Christian concepts of a realCreator (except for Yahweh, for reasons I will explore in this book).*3 [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#fn3] Tiamat and Apsu are often described as watersof a primordial sea, and translators use such expressions as seawater, sweetwater, and abyss to refer to them. But these ideas were generated byethnologists with a purely materialistic worldview and lacking an understandingof spiritual levels of existence. What is called water in translations has to dowith energetic realms beyond our three-dimensional world, a concept that wasinconceivable to earlier (as well as to some contemporary) ethnologists. Tiamatis also sometimes characterized as a chaos monster. In my opinion, this has todo with the fact that, in her fight with Marduk, she had to defend herself andthus needed to create horrible weapons that appeared as monsters (which I willdescribe below). Tiamat is also characterized as a woman, with a motherlinessthat does not give the impression of a monster.*4 [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#fn4] In Sumerian, plurals for things and conceptsare indicated through doubling (sharshar for shar). Here I use the Englishplural ending shars, as is common in international literature.*5 [9781591433040_c01.xhtml#fn5] In surface geometry, a s(h)ar can be 12 × 12kush, or around 36 square meters, as well as 6 buru = 388.8 hectares. In solidgeometry, it is one surface-shar times 1 (Sumerian) yard, or around 18 cubicmeters. As a measure in building technology, it is 1,200 brick stones. See A. O.Nissen et al., Archaic Bookkeeping (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993),28–9, and Reallexikon der Assyriologie (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1987–90),7:457–517.*6 [9781591433040_c02.xhtml#fn6] Here “god” is written with a lowercase “g,” forreasons that will be explained here [9781591433040_c02.xhtml#pg46], since he isthe one we call Yahweh and can identify with Enlil.*7 [9781591433040_c02.xhtml#fn7] A speculation. The word YHWH may be associatedwith “he is” as follows. We may divide it in YH+HUH, keeping the middle H inboth parts and reading the Hebrew letter vav as U, a valid alternative thatdepends on missing diacritical marks. HUH could be derived from HU’ that means“he” and if we add an initial H to the first part: HYH, we get a word thataccording to the Hebrew dictionary means “to be, exist,” from which ’HYH(eh[e]yeh) is derived. Therefore, we could regard YHWH as a kind of contractionof the words ehyeh asher ehyeh in Exodus 3:14. The controversial but veryknowledgeable German linguist Friedrich Delitzsch (1850–1922) was of the opinionthat the name should be read rather similarly as Yaho or Yeho (cf. his book Diegroße Täuschung [The Great Deception]) and was one of the first to suggest aBabylonian origin of the Old Testament, as argued in his book Babel und Bibel,published in English as Babel and Bible (Chicago: The Open Court PublishingCompany, 1903). “I am that I am” might also imply, “It is none of your businesswho I am.”*8 [9781591433040_c02.xhtml#fn8] If the letters are written in reversed order,HWHY, the Hebrew lexicon suggests that it could be composed of two words puttogether: HW = an outcry of sad ness (like “Woe!”) and HY = an outcry oflamentation (Gesenius’s Hebrew and Chaldee Lexikon)."},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHORJan Erik Sigdell [https://www.innertraditions.com/author/jan-erik-sigdell/],born in Sweden, holds a doctorate in medical engineering.
