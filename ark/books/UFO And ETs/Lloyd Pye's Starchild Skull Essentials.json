Lloyd Pye A favorite platitude of scientists says that: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. This allows them to keep raising the standard of acceptable “proof” well beyond the re ach of anyone who puts forth ideas mainstream science doesn’t know how to, or wouldn’t want to, deal with. This document details one of the most extraordinary claims being made anywhere in the world today, a nd it provides a boatload of the extraordinary evidence science requires to support such a contentious assertion. It supplies what scientists demand in exactly th e way they demand it, without visual smoke screens or verbal obfuscations —just cold, hard, undeniable facts."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 3   PREFACE The Starchild Skull is a bone s kull, not crystal and not fossi lized, which has confused many people. In the past 12 years it has been anal yzed by dozens of qualifie d scientists, none of whom have challenged its authenticity as a hum an-like relic. The debate that swirls around it regards its origins, which is this eBook’s crux: clarif ying that debate. Dr. Ted Robinson, quoted above, has worked extens ively with the Starchild Skull. A retired craniofacial plastic surgeon, Ted tried to find a combination of human deformities that could realistically account for the Star child’s physiological differences from a normal human skull. (These will be discussed in full later.) He then enticed a dozen colleagues to risk professional censure to analyze the Starchild with the vigor he knew it deserved. The formal report of their results can be found at the Starchild Projec t website (www.starchildproject.com/2004.htm). Why don’t more mainstream scientists accept th e same challenge? Because peer pressure is crushing relative to subjects deemed “off limits ” for serious discussion and analysis. Things like UFO’s, aliens, hominoids (bigfoot, etc.), and cold fusion are “forbidden” because their proof would utterly transform “reality” as it is today. No scientist wants to be on the hot seat when a paradigm overturns, so they work diligently to keep these various genies corked up in bottles of ignorance and intimidation fueled by their “credentialed” ridicule and disdain. 200 years ago religion dictated what ordinary people could and could not think. “Heretics” overturned that era’s reality and were transforme d into “scientists.” Modern scientists have taken over as arbiters of what ordinary people can and cannot th ink, and new heretics like me are in the process of overturni ng their current realit y. I don’t know what we will be called once we succeed at our task, but I doubt we’ll be called “scientists.” The irony would be too great."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 4  A considerable distance from the village the girl came across an abandoned mine tunnel. The villagers had cautioned the newcomers to avoid the old mines in the area because they were not safe. This was a risk almost any teenager would readily take, and she did. (The similar abandoned mine at left is used today as a dwelling.) AS FOR THE STARCHILD SKULL... Its story began in northern Mexico around 1930, in the high desert area about 100 miles southwest of Chihuahua. This is known as the “Copper Canyon” region, which has terrain similar to the USA’s Grand Can y on in Arizona. Across that remote area were several isolated villages. Visiting relatives in one of the villages was a family of Mexican heritage from El Paso, Texas. In that family was a young girl, 14 or 15, who one day left the village to go exploring. She carried a large basket to hold fruits and berries she’d look for while hiking. GETTING OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT: Please don’t take seri ously anything about the Starchild Skull, or Lloyd Pye, found on Wackypedia. It is a to tally corrupt advocate for mainstream science. If you want to read what Wacky says about me or the Starchild Skull, go to www.starchildproject.com or www.lloydpye.com to find every word in their individual posts about us, but with the actual truth supplied be neath each of their misstatements, distortions, or outright lies."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 5 Inside the mine tunnel the girl discovered a human skeleton exposed on the topsoil, lying on its back (supine). Beside it was a shallow grave uncompressed by weathering, which she realized she could dig out with her bare hands. It contained what she would later term a “misshapen” skeleton that was noticeably shorter than the one on the surface, even though the skulls were the same size. She decided to try to recover both skeletons to sneak them back home to El Paso to donate to her high school. She was able to put all the bones in the basket she was carrying. Both skulls were damaged by tumbling in the torrent of the flash flood. Despite that, the girl was happy to have them, so she secretly hid them insi de her belongings to return them to her home in El Paso. For the rest of her life she saved them as unique “souvenirs” of her trip to Mexico, always assuming the misshapen skull (far left) was a natural deformity of some kind. The girl realized she couldn’t tell the villagers she had liberated two ancestor skeletons, so she decided to take a few days to devise a plan to sneak them back home. She hid all the bones under the exposed roots of a tree growing beside an arroyo. That night torrential rains created a flash flood in the arroyo that washed the bones away. Two days later she found only the skulls and the right half of the misshapen skull’s maxilla (upper jaw), snagged in bushes downstream from the hiding place."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 6  The girl lived a full life and died in the early 1990s. In late 1998 her “souvenirs” came into the possession of Ray and Melanie Young of El Paso. Melanie had been a neonatal nu rse for 15 years and knew the odd skull did not look like a typical human deformity. It was far too light and too symmetrical, and many physical features were far from normal. Because the Youngs were members of MUFON (the Mutual UFO Network), they felt it looked most like a skull that would fit inside the head of a “grey” alien. The Youngs asked MUFON colleagues if anyone in Alternative Knowledge dealt with skulls. They were told about my work with hominoids and my views about human origins (www.lloydpye.com), so in February of 1999 we met in El Paso. They showed me the skulls and asked me to have the odd one scientifically tested to determine what it was. I agreed and began overseeing a series of specific tests, the first of which provided X-rays of both skulls and the detached piece of right-side maxilla (upper jaw). At left the maxilla piece is held in its approximately correct position. The maxilla X-ray revealed several impacted teeth (the fi ve dark “globs” at left) above the two exposed teeth (only one is seen at this angle) , indicating death at 5 or 6 years old. Thus, we dubbed the relic The Starchild Skull . Giving it that name was a mistake I came to regret. Whenever most scientists hear it, it triggers deeply ingrained prejudices against anything relating to UFOs and/or aliens, so they summarily dismiss it as worthless."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 7    The human skull (left and center) show ed typical frontal sinuses between the eye sockets. The Starchild had no trace of frontal sinuses, not even vestigial bumps indicating where its sinuses might have attempted to g row. This is considered exce p tionall y unusual in human mor p holo gy . The profile X-ray of the human skull revealed extreme flattening at its rear down to its inion , a bump at the lower rear of anyone’s head where big neck muscles attach (red arrow). This is undeniable proof it was cradleboarded (see next box) when it was an infant. Also, separate radiocarbon dating tests (Carbon-14) revealed that both the Starchild and the human died 900 years ago, making cradleboarding even more likely as the cause of its area of extreme flattening. Cradleboarding was, and in some places remains, common in primitive cultures. A baby is swaddled against a board to be carried on a working mother’s back. The baby’s head is strapped down so it won’t be jostled as the mother stoops and stands while doing her daily work. This process gradually compresses the baby’s soft rear skull bones to complete flatness, every bit as flat as the board to which the head is strapped."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 8 Although the rear of the Starchild’s head is much flatter than normal, X-rays reveal natural convolutions in the bone. Thus, it could never have been cradleboarded. Despite this convincing evidence against any technique of manual compression or deformation, many experts still stubbornly insist that cradleboarding provides the most plausible explanation for it because that conforms to a favorite scientific tenet known as Occam’s Razor . A tenet is any doctrine generally held to be true. Occam’s Razor is the tenet that says the simplest answer is usually the correct one , even for the most complex problems. Cradleboarding is by far the simplest explanation for the Starchild’s extreme flattening, even though a cursory view of it reveals the natural convolutions that make the claim utterly false. Even so, many scientists insist that it must be true because it conforms so well with the useful we apon of Occam’s Razor. Another clear proof of the impossibility of cradleboarding is the angles at which the heads would have to be placed on the cradleboard. If, when alive as an infant, the Starchild had been strapped onto a cradleboard, it would have suffocated in a short time due to compression of its chin against its windpipe. This illustration is blindingly obvious, yet many esteemed scientists will provide a strenuous argument th at such evidence should be ignored rather than to seek a more believable answer to this mystery about the Starchild Skull’s morphology."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 9  Another powerful argument against hydrocephaly in the Starchild is the obvious “crease” or “dent” in the upper rear of its craniu m. Any skull with increased internal pressure (which would push outward uniformly, in all directions) could not possibly produce a crease unless the saggital suture (see next photos) was prematurely fused. Any open saggital suture (arrows at left) is healthy. If the Starchild’s was fused shut, it could explain the crease between its expanded parietal bones and leave hydrocephaly as a possible explanation. However, a CAT-scan (right) shows no such fusion existed. Most scientists ignore this clear fact. Another notable aspect of the St archild is the ex pansion of its parietal bones (a skull’s upper re ar lobes seen in the previous rear view) to outsized proporti ons relative to normal humans. Experts explain it as typical hydr ocephaly (water on the brain) caused by excess spinal fluid trap ped on or inside its brain. At left is a typical hydrocepha lic infant untreated by modern shunting techniques. Such individuals remain purely human, with normal human eye sockets, normal bone thickness in the non-expanded areas, a neck in the normal position, etc. The Starchild Skull has none of those morphological features. The latest “fad” diagnosis to explain the Starchild is Pr ogeria, a genetic disorder that ages children prematurely to wither away before reaching 20. As with hydrocephaly, they remain human in all fundamental aspects, especially in their craniums, which is not so with the Starchild. Rather th an thinning out and weakening, as with Pr ogeria, all of the Starchild’s bone is extraordinarily hard."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 10 How is the Starchild Skull unique? For one thing, normal human eye sockets are 2\" deep and cone- like, with the optic nerve and foramen openings located deep inside. The Starchild’s sockets are 0.7\" deep, and its optic nerves and foramens are down and close to the inside of the nose. That is a wildly different design. (The dark area on the Starchild’s “cheek” was from soil staining during burial.) Last and probably least among routine attempts to explain away the Starchild Skull is that it might be some kind of hybrid between a human and a terrestrial species such as a chimp. Here is the skull of a juvenile chimp. You decide if that idea seems plausible or not. If the Starchild Skull isn’t the result of a known deformity, what the heck IS it? Basically, it is a human-like skull slightly smaller than an average adult (me), and more like a 12-year-old such as actor Jaden Smith, seen here in his role as “The Karate Kid.” How would the Starchild look with a lower face and jaw? The detached piece of upper right maxilla, which we will examine later in detail, was used to create the model of the Starchild’s lower face and jawbone. This model is much too large, needing to be the size of an infant’s lower face and jaws. However, the dental lab where we had it made couldn’t make a denture mold for an infant, so they used the smallest template they had, which does provide an approximate image."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 11  The surfaces of the Starchild’s eye sockets appear perfectly smooth. No shifts in their terrain are evident to human eyes. Yet very subtle shifts are there, and they are exactly alike in each socket, which can be felt with a fingertip. Such incredible symmetry can only come from genetic instructions that are very different from normal humans. Profile view of both skulls. The nose area, the upper jaw (maxilla), and left zygomatic arch (cheekbone) are present on the human (far left) but b roken off of the Starchil d . The upper ledges of human eye sockets are rounded, feeling to the hand like a soda straw. The Starchild’s upper sockets come to an edge, not sharp enough to cut, but markedly thin. The two are as dissimilar as can be imagined, as apples and oranges. Using as a link point the nose bridges of the two skulls, this is an accurate comparison between their numerous facial realignments in general, and their eye sockets in particular. Note the shape modifications and marked repositioning of the optic foramens. Despite the Starchild’s extreme deviations from the human norms, those differences ar e stunningly precise and symmetrical. They must be due to equally precise changes in its genetic code that dictate how its face was constructed and how those many changes were successfully coordinated to create a living being."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 12  The ear holes and the mastoid bones (behind the ears) are clear in both skulls, but in the Starchild are positioned well forward and downward. Also, the broken base of the Starchild’s cheekbone has a different shape and a much tighter angle than a normal human. Normal humans, left, have brow ridges that are distinct, while a normal nose inevitably indents somewhat where it connects to the brow. The Starchild has neither a brow ridge nor an indentation at the connection with its nose. This is highly unusual, if not absolutely unique, among all higher primates. The lump of bone at the lower rear middle of every human skull is the “inion.” It is a connection point for neck muscles that anchor on it (feel your own). Every primate has one. In the Starchild its inion is entirely absent from its normal position, and instead is down quite low where its reduced neck muscles attach. A CAT-scan of a normal human’s inner ears (left) compared to the Starchild’s, which are twice as large. Human inner ears are a major aspect of our balancing mechanism. It is hard to imagine why the Starchild would develop such oversized inner ears, much less guess how they were used."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 13  At left is the human’s inion (red circle) and fossa (dented areas) that flank it where its neck muscles connect. Instead of an inion, the Starchild has a slightly indented circular area (red circle). The red box shows the small fossa where its neck muscles attach. No human neck is ever constructed like this. The red circle at left covers the human’s “basilar part,” one of the last bones in a skull to fully fuse, between the ages of 20 to 25. The Starchild’s is gone, suggesting the possibility of death before age 25. However, it also could have been knocked out in the flood tumble that took the lower part of its face. Tumbling inside the flood damaged both skulls, taking the human’s right zygomatic arch (cheekbone—see the above photos), both of the Starchild’s cheekbones, and most of its lower face. This overlay illustrates how reduced the Starchild’s cheekbones would have been, greatly reducing its lower face to the size of a very small child or infant. Another indication of the small size of the Starchild’s lower face is the detached piece of maxilla recovered with the skull. The view on the right is only 1 inch from top to bottom (red line), although part of its bottom is missing. And the roof of its mouth was flattened ra ther than arched, indicating a small tongue or perhaps no tongue at all, though that seems unlikely. 1 \""},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 14  This illustrates the neck areas of the human and Starchild. The Starchild’s is half the size and volume of the human, and its foramen magnum, the hole where the spine enters the skull, has been moved forward by more than an inch. This represents a very significant physical realignment. The Starchild’s extra 400 cc of brain required adjustments to its balance point over its spindly neck. A human skull balances behind its center because the face has hollow areas like sinuses and two deep eye sockets. The Starchild has shallow eye sockets and no sinuses, so it is balanced over its center point. Average human brain volume is 1400 cc. The Starchild’s companion was about 5 feet tall with a brain of only 1200 cc. Although the Starchild’s body seemed “noticeably shorter” to the girl who found them, the skull is the same size as the human. It should have 1200 cc of volume, but it has an astounding 1600 cubic centimeters! Returning to the effects of the flash flood, it is important to understand that a human’s lower jaw is completely detached from its skull. If the cranium in this image were to be lifted up, the lower jaw would stay on the surface. Thus, the moment the flash flood struck the human and the Starchild skulls, their lower jawbones were separated from the rest of their craniums."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 15  A human’s cerebrum (green circle) rests on a cerebellum (red circle) that is internally braced to prevent it from being pressed out of the foramen magnum (neck hole). The Starchild’s unusual shape greatly increases the downward pressure on its un braced cerebellum (if it has one), so its brain could be made of stronger material. Attachment points for the human’s chewing muscles and the Starchild’s, which cover half the area of the human. Again, we see the Starchild’s lower face was quite small, perhaps the size of a child, though our early belief that it was a child was subsequently proved wrong. This Starchild tooth exhibits “crazing,” the dark vertical lines in the enamel (red circles); and pitting on the crowns (arrows). No child can generate so much torque while chewing. This is strong proof that the Starchild was an adult when it died. Another proof of the Starchild’s adult age at death is the fact th at when its rear tooth was removed for analysis, its roots were found to be robustly formed. The roots of baby teeth are absorbed by a child’s body as they prepare to come out. Such teeth have no roots, and this one clearly does."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 16   Close-ups of the surfaces of the human bone (at left) and the Starchild. Pore-like pits, called lacunae , are a vital part of any human bone’s dissolution and regeneration. The Starchild’s lacunae are inexplicably turned into closed specks. No known human deformity causes this . Perhaps the most amazing fact about the Starchild Skull, the one science should have been studying for years, is th at its bone is half as thic k (or less) than normal human bone, it weighs half as mu ch, yet, astonishingly, it is two to three times as durable! This is easy to say and to r ead, but difficult to conceptuali ze. On five occasions I have watched the bone being cut by other people and could see their difficulty when cutting it. Recently I cut it for the first time, using a small hand saw. To cut one inch into the Starchild’s bone in an area as thin as in the area above, I needed between 200 and 300 strokes of the blade. To cut 1.25 inches of the human bone required about 50 strokes. Only experiencing it at this visceral leve l can truly illustrate how amazingly hard it is. This extraordinary added strength comes from three sources explained below. A palate for the Starchild created by mirror imaging the piece of maxilla. The palate is flat, with no discerna ble arcing curve found in normal humans. This suggests that the Starchild had a very sma ll tongue, a very flat tongue. . . or perhaps no tongue at all, which seems unlikely but shouldn’t be considered impossible.

The first shows a fiber clearly woven into the matrix of the bone, like rebar in concrete, but exposed at the surface. The second is a stray piece of fiber snagged on a rough stretch of cut. The third is a thinner kind of fiber emerging from a cancellous hole (where marrow originates and moves through a bone).

Oxidized marrow is black, not red, so what this is or how it came to be there is unknown. It also is not f ound in an y other bone on earth . This is a close-up of a polished segment of the human’s skull bone. It shows sparkling clean cancellous holes that have been scoured of all marrow by bacteria that are carried within the body. Shortly after death those bacteria become activated to consume the marrow, and in the wild they devour it all within several weeks. 1. Its bone is half as thick as it s hould be and it weighs half as much. 2. Its bone is two-to-three times more durable than it should be. 3. That durability is due to three ab solutely unique physical characteristics. (a) Its chemical makeup is mo re like tooth enamel than normal human bone. (b) It contains much more collagen than is found in normal human bone. (c) Durable fibers are so mehow woven throughout the bone’s matrix. (i) These fibers are unknown in any other species on earth. 4. A red residue found in its cancellous holes is not found in any other species. 5. Its eye sockets are utterly unlik e the eye sockets of normal humans. 6. It has no trace of frontal sinuses; huma ns always have at least vestiges of them. 7. It has a “crease” along its saggital suture that is not found in normal humans. 8. It does not have the brow ridge th at is found in all other higher primates. 9. It has no “dip” downward from its missing brow ridge to form its nose. 10. Its inner ears are at least twice the size of normal human inner ears. 11. It does not have the inion that is found in all other primates on earth. 12. Its neck is oval-shaped and half th e size and volume of a normal human neck. 13. Its foramen magnum opening is shifte d well forward from normal humans. 14. Its balance point is cent ered under its physical mass while humans are off-center. 15. Its chewing muscles cover only half of the surface area of a normal human. 16. Its brain is fully 1/3 larger and thus heav ier than it should be for its cranial size. 17 Gravity should have squeezed its overs ized brain out of the foramen magnum. (a) A lack of any such squeezing i ndicates its brain was made of denser material. 18 The lacuna pits scattered across the surface of its bone are completely missing. 19. Its maxilla held worn mature teeth a nd impacted teeth, which humans do not have. 20. Its mouth was infant sized with a flat r oof that indicates a small or missing tongue. 21. Its lower face was extremely small and narro w, perhaps only the size of an infant. 22. It does not conform to any known human deformity or any combination of them."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 20 HOW COULD SO MANY ABERRATIONS COMBINE TO CREATE A BEING THAT BECAME A LIVING ADULT?   HOW DOES SCIENCE EXPLAIN SUCH ANOMALIES?  At 900 years ago, one deviation from normal in the head or face of a newborn wasn’t necessarily life threatening. Perhaps even b lindness or deafness could be overcome. But two deviations from the norm in a newborn’s head would put it at se rious risk of being eliminated from the tribe. Three wrong mean t almost certain death because infanticide was not considered a moral issue in primitiv e societies. Thus, it seems highly unlikely that the many aberrations evident in the Star child’s head could app ear in a newborn in any primitive society 900 years ago without that infant being eliminated as unfit. Apart from the long odds against a “freak” be ing allowed to live, it is equally unlikely, if not impossible, for so many physical differe nces to appear in a human head and yet somehow have all those differen ces be magically coordinated so they came together to function in a new cascade of ways never seen on Earth before or since. This is the only way to explain what seems to have happened with the Starchild. It s skull does not have a single exact corollary with a typical human s kull. Not one part of it is exactly the way it should be. Yet apparently it functioned—s omehow—at a competent level of ability, well enough so it could survive to adulthood in an extremely rigorous environment. (This assumes, of course, that it lived where it died, which is not necessarily the story of its life. It could have come to that area fr om somewhere else entirely, from on the Earth or perhaps off it, and thus arrived where it was found only a short time before its death.) Mainstream science has consistently failed to explain—or even explain away —any of the Starchild’s anomalies, much less the complex combination that somehow created a functioning being. Why? Because science has co llectively agreed to set its BS detector to go off if anything passes by it that is not already understood or does not fit accepted theories. By tethering themselves so tightly to the limits of presen t knowledge, they take only very tiny and very sure steps forward. T hus, they regularly banish a Galileo to the tower, only to have the light from the tower ev entually cast them all into deep shadows. Take, for example, the fibers in the Starchild’s bone. If scientists c ould speculate free of reprisal by militant peers, they might suggest that those fibers are made of pure carbon nanotubes. Right now mainstream researcher s are developing ways to cultivate human bone cells on scaffolds of just such nanotubes. What if that had already been done in the deep past by minds enormously more brilliant than theirs? What if scientists could take the Starchild’s durable fibers and back-engine er them to determine what makes them so strong, and then apply that to treatin g the fragility of aged human bones? What if....?"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 21 WHAT DID THE STARCHILD LOOK LIKE IN LIFE?  At left is a magazine cover in which a graphic artist morphed a child’s face to appear to be analogous to the Starchild’s cranium. Interesting but not accurate. The morphing on the right was a bit less successful! Artist Mark Savee applied mathematical precision to his renditio n of it, but the top of the head is too rounded and the lower jaw is much too heavy. The eyes are not bad, nor is the nose, but the neck is a bit too large. Overall, a solid effort. A creative juxtaposition by Rob Roy Menzies, attaching a lower face to the Starchild Skull’s X-ra y. Much closer to reality than any previous version, while clearly showing that wide variation is possible due to artistic interpretation. At left is the portrait on the cover of Whitley Strieber’s bestselling book Communion (1987). This has become the world’s iconic image of “grey” aliens.

I did, but I also warned them that no forensic sculptor would have anything other than human templates to work from, so the result was bound to be a distinctly human face under a bulbous head with a flattened rear. Sure enough, the image seen on that show has a face that to me strongly resembles Lee Harvey Oswald! In early 2010 the TV show “Monster Quest” decided to make the Starchild Skull part of a segment called, of all things, Lizard Quest . They hired qualified forensic artist Bill Munns to try his hand at it, with much more success. I feel he made the eyes and the eyeballs too much like human eyes, and the neck too large, but overall a plausible image. A statistical analysis of Bill Munns’ creation done by famed Canadian hominoid researcher Chris Murphy. The left bars show the relative proportions of its face in inches. The right columns give percentages of distance in humans (i.e., eyes normally in the middle of a face), with the Starchild’s differences in its column. Most noticeable is that the tops of human ears are normally slightly above eye level. The Starchild’s are significantly lower, and the other differences are also statistically significant."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 23 WHAT MIGHT THE STARCHILD BE? In 1997 a Seattle artist named David W. Chace self-published a book of drawings of alien beings reported by people who claimed to have seen them. Those drawings produced various groups: (1) human-like Lyrans, Pleiadians, Anunnaki, etc.; (2) reptili ans (in the red robe); (3) insectoids (not seen on the cover); (4) blue “fireplug” beings (the rarest of all); (5) short greys; and (6) tall greys. Beside them are two hybridized types, one between tall greys and a human type (7), and the other between small greys and the reptilian type (8). A possible Starchild likeness is se cond from the right in the front row (red arrow at ankle), the hybrid between human types and small greys. Many women around the world make the startling claim that they’ve been taken aboard a UFO to be impregnated by aliens. Soon they have an ultrasound that confirms the pregnancy. In the fourth month they have the signs of a miscarriage but no fetus. A few years later they are again taken aboard a UFO, are shown a child (male or female), are told it is their hybrid offspring, and are then allowed to interact with it. Women who have even partial memories of this experience consistently describe these hybrids as looking similar to the film character seen at left. In mid-1999, Professor Emeritus Dr. Paula Gunn-Allen (UCLA, deceased in 2008), h eard about the Starchild Skull and informed me that her resear ch into the history of native peoples in the Americas had revealed what she termed “Star Being” legends. These said that for hundreds of years alien beings would make a barren woma n in a village pregnant with a Star Being. The village would then be tasked with raising it up to 5 or 6 or 7 or 8, when the aliens would return to collect the young Star Being. Dr. Gunn-A llen said similar stories were common in primitive cultures around the world."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 24 Later in 1999, an artist from Taos, New Mexico, named Josi Galante contacted me to say she had been abducted by a UFO in 1990, had been made pregnant by grey-type aliens, and lost the baby in the fourth month. In 1995 she was re-taken on board a UFO by grey-type aliens who in troduced her to a 5-year-old boy they said was her own hybrid son. She came to believe the boy was indeed hers, and she retained enough memory of the events on board the craft to re nder pencil drawings of him. I asked her for copies of her drawi ngs, and this is the front view. Profile drawing of Josi Galante’s hybrid son overlaid on a profile of the Starchild Skull. The drawing is from 1995, the photo is from 1999. Several areas match well (eyes, neck, shape of head), while others do not (the ears are too high, the upper nose has a dip). In 1978 an anonymous lawyer was taken on board a UFO and dealt with grey-type aliens. He came out of that experience with enough memory to commission a bust of a grey to be sculpted. Here, too, are areas of congruence with the Starchild (posit ion of ears, shape of head, eyes set low on face, at mid-nose), and areas of conflict (cheekbones too large, neck too large, upper nose has a dip). Josi Galante’s hybrid son, the Starchild skull, a nd the bust of the grey alien. All thr ee are variations on a deeply archetypal theme that, according to Paula Gunn-Allen, extends back in time for centuries in the Americas, and possibly for millennia around the world."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 25 HOW CAN GENETIC TESTING PROVE WHAT THE STARCHILD IS AND WHERE IT CAME FROM?    The genetic code of life on earth (and possibly in other places) is mathematics turned into biology, or biology turned into math, depending on your point of view. In either case, it is absolutely definitive because no one can mount a serious argument against it. If a murder case has 50 eyewitnesses who say a certain person committed the crime, and if 50 police and legal professionals are c onvinced by on-scene evidence that the alleged perpetrator committed the crime, that would be consider ed overwhelming evidence in any court of law. Yet if DNA evidence contradicted all of that eyewitness and professional testimony, the DNA evidence would win. Everyone knows this and understands it to be true because DNA is considered so precise and unerri ng. It has been called God’s handwriting. With the Starchild skull, its case is very si milar to the one described above. We are faced with hundreds and thousands of mainstream sc ientists and mainstream media types who over the course of their lives have been convi nced to believe that UFOs and aliens don’t exist because so many supposed “experts” insist those things can’t exist. It is the widely accepted “conventional wisdom” of our era that because distances between galaxies are so vast, and because we ourselves don’t know how to easily overcome those distances, it is therefore safe to conclude that no other spec ies could possibly be smarter than we are. Despite blustering “official” assurances in every generation, countle ss prior conventional wisdoms have been overturned by new evidence. The earth is not flat, nor is it the center of the universe. This is an exceedingly long list that extends from deep into the past up to the present day. However, the point here is not about how wrong experts are consistently proven to be. The point is that even when th ey gather themselves into enormous numbers against something, it never makes them correct , it simply makes them intimidating. But intimidating or not, they are all too often wr ong, and such is the case with the Starchild. The Starchild Skull’s two dozen major physiological differences previously outlined are convincing evidence that it is human-like but not entirely huma n. Furthermore, DNA testing performed in 2003 showed conclusively that its mother was human but its father was something other than 100% human. Unfort unately, in 2003 we had no way to prove precisely how far away from human the father might be. The technology for that did not become available until the middle of 2006, but it was absurdly expensive and we could not take advantage of it. Now, in 2011, we ’re finally in positio n to get it done. During the next several pages, I will explain the basics of genetic analysis so anyone can understand how the process works and how it ca n prove the Starchild Skull is, beyond any reasonable doubt, a genetically engineered hum an-alien hybrid. I realize how volatile that statement is, and how vigorously certain scien tists will dispute it, but they know what you will know after you read these page s, which is that this battle , for them, is already lost."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 26  Now you should understand the basics of the way our cells are put together. However, one more fundamental unit of material comprises th e genes, so imagine there is another image and explanation positioned to the right of the last one above ( Genes) . This is a depiction of Base Pairs , which are made up of the four nucleotides listed to the right. These four building blocks comp rise the entirety of our genes, our chromosomes, and ultimately us. . .the entirety of our cellular structure. That entirety is called our genome , which is the total amount of chromosomal package in every cell’s nucleus. The key number to keep in mind is that a human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs. That is billion with a “b,” not millions. Read all parts of the illust ration below. Be sure you unders tand them. They are important. You also should know that human cells contain two distinct types of genetic ma terial: (1) in the nucleus is nuclear DNA (nuDNA), which is the entire genome (3 billion base pa irs) contributed by both parents; and (2) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) floating within the cytoplas m in tiny organelles that contain about 16,000 base pairs in each one. During procreation, mtDNA is passed along by females only. Thus, the Starchild’s mtDNA would have come directly from its mother, grandmother, etc."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 27 HOW WAS THE STARCHILD’S DNA RECOVERED?  Soon we will examine genetic engineer ing as it relates to the Starchild, so we should note here that the human genome shows clear evidence of genetic engineering at some point in our distant past (most likely about 200,000 years ago). The clearest sign is our 23 chromosome pairs when all other higher primates have 24. How can we share a close genetic relationship with chimps and gorilla s (they also have roughly 3 billion base pairs), yet we have two fewe r chromosomes? We can’t! For some reason the 3 billion base pairs in the gorilla & chimp’s 24 chromosome package had to be made to fit into 23 spaces in humans. So, incredibly, the higher primate’s 2 nd and 3 rd chromosomes were fused into one! Left to right, the 2 n d chromosome of a human with its clear fusion point (red circle), beside the separate 2 nd and 3 rd chromosomes of a chimp, gorilla, and orangutan. Geneticists insist a functi oning fusion of disparate chromosomes had to occur naturally because peer pre ssure prevents considering the valid alternative of genetic engineering. N onetheless, removing and fusing myriad microscopic genetic components at this level rivals creating a Swiss watch for a gnat! In addition to that “mir aculous” fusion, humans have segment inversions on chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Inversions are stretches of DNA nipped top and bottom, flipped upside down, then moved back into place and reconnected! Thus, it seems likely humans were created by genetic engineering, so the same coul d easily be true with the Starchild. When I became caretaker of the Starchild Skul l in early 1999, my first task was to understand all of its physiological differences. As I establis hed those, I also discovered that no amount of them would impress skeptical scientists. One to ld me that he didn’t care if I collected 10,000 physical differences; he’d still feel justified explaining them away by saying, “Nature can do anything!” To scientists, Nature is the equivalent of religion’ s God. They can hide behind her wide skirts to explain any physiological anomal y that is particularly vexing. So it was soon clear to me that I would never make any head way against the skeptics by appealing to their sense of reason or logic or even fair play. On ly genetic proof would impress them, and that was true only because it left them with no means of arguing around it or explaining it away. With that established, I began to seek out ge netic labs that could analyze the Starchild’s DNA. Carbon-14 testing had independently date d the Starchild and the human found with it at 900 years ago, so that qualified it as “anci ent” DNA (past 50 years). To analyze ancient DNA required extra special handling that forens ic labs dealing with “fresh” DNA could not match. That was because ancient DNA was usually quite degraded. However, the mine tunnel where the Starchild was buried was the equivalent of a climate-controlled storage locker, so we were hopeful its DNA would be minimally degr aded and thus fairly easy to recover."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 28   Their first step was to cut out the human’s occipital condyles (at left), knobs of bone on either side of the foramen magnum opening. As we expected, its nuclear DNA was easy to recover and showed that the skull was from a normal human female. All systems seemed “go.” The first test on the Starchild also took out its condyles, but a contamination voided the result. The lab next removed the right mastoid bone (red arrow) and contaminated it, too. Then, because it was a forensic dental lab, they began to insist on taking one of the two teeth present in the piece of maxilla. In 1999, six labs in the world could recover “ancient” DNA, but none would test the Starchild Skull because of the professional stigma involved. Then in November, 1999, the Bureau of Legal Dentistry (BOLD), a forensic teaching lab located on the campus of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, agreed to attempt to extract its nuclear DNA despite not being technically equipped to do so. The lab would only run a third te st if I agreed to sacrifice one of the two teeth in the maxilla so they could get at its pristine pulp. The lab team guaranteed a non-contaminated result if I would give up the precious tooth. I hated to do that because I knew how much any tooth could reveal about its owner, but they had me b acked into a corner with few options. Besides, losing one t ooth still left us with one."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 29  The result of the tooth analysis was a profound shock to us. The lab claimed to recover from it 200 pic ograms of nuclear DNA that proved the Starchild was a human male. This was shocking because normally at least 1000 picograms were requir ed for a dependable result, yet the lab insisted they could draw a firm conclusion from such a minimal recover y . I vi g orousl y p rotested , but the y insisted the y were correct. 1 st DNA test, Canada, bottom line: We got screwed, plain and simp le. No other way to say it. We may never know if those wrong results were deliberately calculated by someone intent on sabotage, or resulted from a series of well-in tentioned technical/professi onal botches. However, the upshot was that the Starchild and I were no longer welcome at BOLD, and I should return home to New Orleans and accept that it was not hing more than a bizarrely deformed human. I knew such a result could not possibly be co rrect because of so many profound physiological differences between the Starch ild and normal humans, but at that point I was hamstrung. As soon as the BOLD Lab results were announced to what was by then a worldwide audience of alternative fans, the disappointment was palpable . “The Starchild is human! Damn!” So I was forced into a metaphorical gul ag for three years, mostly disappeared from alternative circles. During those three years I trie d desperately to find a way to secure a proper ancient DNA test for the Starchild, one I was sure would prove the Vancouver result was wrong. Naturally, everyone assumed a certified DNA lab would know a lot more about the situ ation than me, so I couldn’t get a hearing anywhere. By Christmas of 2002 I was out of options and facing bankruptc y, so I sent a letter to the Starchild email list to announce that I could go no further with doing research into it. In response, a stranger to me named Belinda McKenzie wrote from London to say she would finance the required te st if I could arrange it. Even though we had paid for only one test, I insisted on a fourth by arguing that two cont aminations and an extremely weak recovery on the third was due cause for a fourth so we could be certain of the result. Ultimately, they agreed to cut out a window from the parietal bon e to test that (see light tan patched-over area near red arro w tip). Lo and behold! Once again the lab claimed to extract exactly 200 picograms of viable DNA that definitively proved it was a human male."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 30    By early 2003, what used to be only six labs capable of doing ancient DNA extractions had ballooned to 24, so now I had leverage. New labs were opening regularl y, and I soon found Ripan Malhi and Jason Eshleman of Trace Genetics. Though young, they had sterling credentials, and they agreed to put the Starchild and its human companion through bona fide ancient DNA tests. In July of 2003, Jason cut a “w indow” from the Starchild’s left parietal lobe for testi ng. While doing that, he discovered that its bone was remarkably ha rder to cut into than normal human bone. Its extraordinary durability had been barely mentioned to me by the BOLD Lab personnel. Nonetheless, we were at last underway w ith what I felt would be the defining resolution to the entire Starchild mystery. The window of bone was cut into four smaller pi eces for testing purposes. One was put into a test tube filled with EDTA, and that was put into a rocker arm. A similar piece of bone from the human was put in a rocker arm be side it. In one week the EDTA would entirely dissolve normal human bone, which it did with the human from th e mine tunnel. However, the Starchild’s bone did not dissolve at all, not in one week and not in one month. It had to be dissolved by a very powerful detergent called 'Tween 20. This was a nother clear indication th at the Starchild was something other than entirely human because no other human bone required such handling. Because of the CSI television shows, near ly everyone everywhere knows at least the fundamentals of how DNA is extracted and sque ezed into gel sheet strips to reveal the specific DNA patterns of victims or suspects of crimes. The same held for the human and the Starchild. Their DNA was extracted and then primers were applied to those extractions. Primers are man-made strings of base pairs from a few hundred to a few thousand long. They can be imagined as gene tic keys that fit into extremely specific locks. If human-based primers find coroll aries in an unknown batch of DNA, there can be absolutely no doubt whatever that th e unknown batch came from a human. And, likewise, if human-only primers do not find corollaries in a batc h, it is not human."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 31   One-half of an electrophoresis gel sheet used to analyze the DNA from the human found with the Starchild. It must be understood in this form before a fuller rendition will make sense. When a gel sheet is used, two things can be tracked to be certain it is “live” and able to record DNA accurately: (1) a guideline sample of known DNA is added (red box); and (2) primer dimers formed by intermolecular interactions between two primers (the 3 isolat ed bars to left of red box). Once the human’s DNA and the Starchild’s DNA were recovered and ready for testing, Ripan and Jason would try to isolate thei r nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA. Using the long base-pair chains of human-only primers available in 2003, they sought nuDNA in both samples. If they found it in ei ther one, then a human mother and a human father contributed their respective 23 chromosomes and we were dealing with a normal human. Unfortunately, both the mother and the father’s chromosomal package had to be intact for the primers to activate. With a human-alien hybrid, we might get no recovery if non-responsive alien DNA was sufficiently present in the genome. This testing would resolve the issue definitively. The first test was of the human’s mtDNA. That was easily recovered on the first attempt. Primer dimer is at the far left of the sheet, and the vertical column in the middle is the guide. The four bright bars verified my strong suspicion that the human’s DNA was not appreciably degraded after its 900 years in a mine tunnel. The horizontal pattern of the four brightest bars meant the human was from Haplogroup A, a genetic group common in early Mesoamericans. The Starchild’s mtDNA was also easily recovered on the first attempt, which was very good news for us because that meant it also suffered little or no degradation in the mine. At the far left is a guide, the black line is drawn through one stray primer dimer, and the four bright bars are the arrangement for Haplogroup C, another genetic group relatively common among early Mesoamericans."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 32  The easy recovery of the Star child’s mtDNA meant three importa nt things: (1 ) its nuclear DNA was certainly viable and should be easy to recover, so we could anticipate definitively establishing its genetic herita ge; (2) its mother had passed along human mtDNA, so she was clearly human, which meant my theory that it was entirely a grey alien had to be discarded; and (3) the human found with it was not related to it genetica lly, which meant she could not possibly have been its mother. I’d come to believe that if the Starchild was in fact a hybrid, its mother would be human and she was probabl y the skeleton found with it, having buried it and then laid down beside it to commit suicid e. That theory, too, had to be discarded. So now it all came down to the nuclear DNA analysis . What would that show for both skulls? The glowing column represents the nuclear DNA result for the human’s bone. Its individual DNA signature revealed that it belonged to a human with a normal female’s usual XX chromosomal arrangement. We expected this answer for her because the BOLD Lab al so easily recovered her nuclear DNA on their first attempt. This represents the search for the Starchild’s nuclear DNA. After six full attempts, only stray bits of primer dimer were recovered. Those six failed attempts made it clear that the St archild’s nuclear DNA could not be recovered using any human-only primers. This proved that the lab in Vancouver never actually found the Starchild’s nuclear DNA —it could never be found with the technology they used! T hus, after the high financial cost and embarrassment of my exile, I was vindicated. 2 nd DNA test, Trace Genetics, bottom line: We obtained a confirmed resu lt that the Starchild’s mother was human and its father was not entirely human. But what was he? More to the point, how far was he from being a normal human? Was he a mere fraction different, so mething so close that mainstream geneticists would proclaim him some kind of “aberrant” human? Or far enough away to make it obvious to anyone that he was an “alien”? This is discussed in deta il in the next text box."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 33 WHAT WAS PROVED BY THE 2003 DNA TEST?    Despite providing personal vindication for me re lative to the flawed BOLD Lab results, the 2003 DNA test result was disheartening in many wa ys. After four years of struggle to have a reliable ancient DNA test, we finally secured it and then it could not definitively resolve our primary questions. Despite that, we l earned several things important to know: (1) The DNA in both samples was exceptionally well preserved after 900 years. (2) The mtDNA recovery proved the Starchild’s mother was undoubtedly human. (3) The Starchild’s nuDNA was viable, but not recoverable by human-only primers. Combining the last two of those left only one stark and startling conclusion: By knowing the Starchild’s mother was human, and by knowing its nuclear DNA was viable but not responding to human-only primers, that could on ly mean that the father was causing the primer keys to fail to find their specific human locks. The father wasn’t entirely human!!! Unfortunately, as Jason and Ripan pointed ou t, mainstream science would only accept their result as a simple failure to recover the St archild’s nuclear DNA. It was Occam’s Razor at work. Scientists inevitably seek the simple st answer to vexing conundrums they don’t want to deal with, regardless of how absurd the si mple answer might be. And by far the simplest answer to this vexing conundrum was that 900-year-old nuDNA had hopelessly degraded. Never, ever could it be that the DNA was vi able but human-only primers couldn’t find it. Keep in mind that mainstream science stays pe rmanently engaged in a pitched battle against any information that in any way casts doubt on ce rtain essential “truths” they’ve established to keep Creationists at bay. This has been their reality since Darwin’s “Origin of Species” in 1859, which tossed religious leaders out of their catbird seat. Now science clings with equal desperation to their own position of dominance, and threats like the Starchild terrify them. The threat the second DNA tests present is all but proving the Starchild was a hybrid with a human mother and a non-human father. Not qui te definitive proof, but the handwriting was on the wall. Any scientist who took the time to study what we had done and what we were doing would understand that. But few if any bothered because the Starchild’s nuDNA could have been degraded by 900 years in a mine tunne l. However, the very easy recovery of the human’s mtDNA and its nuDNA, and the Starch ild’s mtDNA, defeated that argument. Its nuclear DNA was viable, waiting to be recovered, but never by human primers. That was equally clear to us. So now we had to find a di fferent way to recover it, a way that did not require the use of primers. But how? How coul d we utilize technology that didn’t exist?"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 34    H - A Hybrid Human Neanderthal Chimpanzee Gorilla 99.95 – 99.99 % 97% 97% 97% 95%  In 2003 only base-pair strings of primers could be utilized to recover either mitochondrial or nuclear DNA. Imagine a primer to be lik e one-half of the DNA segment above, looking for its precise match in a sample of unknown DNA segments. When a match is made, they bind together and become similar to the enti re image above. This is it in a nutshell. In 2003 it was impossible to recover a DNA sample from an unknown genome because at least parts of its genome had to be known to cr eate the primers to seek out those parts. So Jason Eshleman and Ripan Malhi informed me I’d have to wait anywhere from three to five more years for a new technology to become availa ble, one able to recover a genome base pair by base pair, all 3 billion in the case of humans and higher primates and, most important of all, the Neanderthals. Concerne d scientists were desperate to sequence the Neanderthal genome because they wanted to know where that primitive hominid species would line up relative to huma ns and chimps and gorillas. Humans are 99.95% to 99.99% alike. Gorillas sh are 95% of our 3 billi on base pair genomic package. Only 5% of our base pairs (150 m illion) account for the vast differences between us. Chimps are 97% alike with only 3% differe nces (90 million base pairs). So where would Neanderthals fall in the 3% be tween chimps and humans? In that same vein, where would a sexually reproduced human-alien (H –A) hybrid fall ? Closer to chimps or closer to humans? [ Note: By 2003, Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA str ongly indicated humans did not evolve from them, nor were they our “kissin’ cousin s,” as was believed for decades. Nonetheless, scientists needed Neanderthals to be much more man- like than chimp-like in order to lend support to their standard evolut ionary model. Now, today, they are claiming that 4% to 5% of human DNA seems to have come from in terbreeding with Nea nderthals. Since 1997 I have been predicting it would be that much, but not for the reasons science stipulates.]"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 35 True to what Jason and Ripan told me in July of 2003, exactly three years later , in July of 2006, a company called 454 Life Sciences in Branford, Connectic ut, announced that they were unveiling a new DNA sequencing technology that completely did away with primers, allowing recovery of an entire genome, known or unknown, base pair by base pair. (For those who can understand it, the new process is shown pictorially at left.) This meant the precious Neanderthal genome could now be sequenced, and mainstream scientists promptly set to work on it. Now, in 2011, they have sequenced over 3 billion base pairs, with several hundred million more to go. It is now scheduled to be completed by the end of 2011, and the cost of sequencing it for the past five-plus years is pushing toward $30 million. This is now roughly the cost of analyzing Otzi, the Neolithic “Iceman” found frozen in the Austrian Alps in 1991. Such costs are always relative to the desire for the information that might be produced. When science wants answers, they have unlimited grant money available. When they don’t want an answer, every imaginable roadblock will be placed in front of those trying to secure it. Such is the case w ith the Starchild Skull’s nuDNA. Science does not want to have to deal with the reality of alien life on planet earth, not now or 900 years in the past. This is an obvious truth that no one but sc ientists would challenge—on principle rather than fact. So this is the problem we have had to work around, even though the 454 Life Science test has been available to us since July of 2006. We simply have not had the enormous amount of money required to do the sequencing, nor could we secure access to any ki nd of official source of money such as the grant system that keeps scientists so well funded. With official funding sources clos ed to us, we could only wait until the 454 testing costs fell with in our meager reach. Then, in early 2010, the head of a topnotch genetics lab contacted me. He said if I’d keep his and his lab’s names secret, he’d attempt to sequence the Starchild’s “m issing” nuclear DNA using a new “shotgunning” technique that could recover much smaller base pair strings than ever before, in the 200-500 base pair range. He said if only bits of its nuDNA existed, he could find them. I gratefully supplied him with a sample of the Starchild’s bone."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 36    In this eBook’s first version, in 2009, at this point in the narrative I wrote: Everything boils down to one question: Ho w far from a normal human’s 100% will the Starchild’s DNA fall? Will it be between Neanderthals and humans? Will it be beyond Neanderthals but not beyond chimps? Will it be beyond chimps but not gorillas? Or could it shock the world and be somewh ere beyond the 5% of gorillas? Based on 12 years of studying the Starchild’s unique aspects, I’m convinced it will be well beyond gorillas. I base this on logical reasoning. In the Starchild Skull at least two dozen major physiological variations are found. Each variation results from multiple groups of genetic instructions that are very different from a normal human. Add all of those millions of differences in base pair a lignments with the additional millions that appear if we assume similar differences throughout the Starchild ’s body, head to toe. Those physical variations in the Starchild S kull are facts, and by using 454’s specialized recovery techniques, those facts will produce results that cannot be dismissed, ignored, ridiculed, or disputed by anyone. Such results will be immutable, so scientists will—like it or not—have to accept them and deal w ith them, as will religion and government. **** This knowledge formed the basis of my hopes as the new geneticist attempted to recover the Starchild’s long-sought nuclear DNA. I hoped he would succeed enough to tell us at least something more than what we alrea dy knew about its obvious ly nonhuman father. Where would it fall in a comparison with gor illas, chimps, Neanderthals, and humans? I also hoped the geneticist would firmly esta blish the Starchild as a human-alien hybrid. To do that he would have to secure ev idence powerful enough, or overwhelming enough, to silence all criticism from mainstream scientists. Let’s face it, millions of them insist alien life is impossible, yet one irrefutable DNA recovery could easily demolish all of their bluff and bluster. In the court of public and media opinion, DNA is invincible. Again, it is God’s handwriting, and we hoped He had left us a note we could read. An important part of that ge netic note would be, hopefully, an explanation for how a human a nd an alien could biologically mate. If they were as different as I assumed they must be, how could they have sex and create offspring? Was that possible? Remember when I said genetic engineering seemed to make humans so startlingly different from other higher primates? That comes into play with the Starchild. It seems far more likely to have resulted from genetic engineering than from “natural” sexual union between its parents. And remember, genetic engineering can produce enormous skews in the expression of any physiological traits in any offspring."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 37   Once again, in 2009 I wrote what is below: At left are a Liger and a Tigon, hybrids created by a sexual union between lions and tigers. Half of their genomes come from each parent, but their genes will express a unique ratio that is never exactly 50%. It can be 60% Mom and 40% Dad, or even 70% Dad and 30% Mom, but always in a “natural” bracket. However, if a being like the Starchild were to be genetically engineered, then the percentage ratio of its expressed genes could be anything the geneticists creating it decided it should have. It could be 80% and 20%, 90% and 10%, or even 95% and 5%! [ Note: Recall my recent comment re: Neanderthals. ] Any such ratio is possible, and the Starchild’s wildly anomalous physiology says to me that the role of its human mother was minimal, although she would, of course, have supplied all of its mitochondrial DNA. This is the crucial point to grasp: the Starchild is far more than “half” alien. It is dominantly an alien that was, in my opinion, probably “fathered” by a grey, which can and will be proved by a 454 DNA test. That was what I believed in 2009. Then, in ea rly 2010, when the new geneticist asked to try for the Starchild’s nuclear DNA, I once again sh oved all my chips to the middle of the table and said, “Let ‘em roll!” It would be make-o r-break because if he couldn’t find any nuDNA with his shotgun technique, th en no matter how the situation appeared , I’d be, as one Deep South saying goes, a blowed-up peckerwood, a nd the Starchild Project would have to end. It was a loooong few weeks until I heard from him in a cryptic email that said: “Hang on, Dorothy . . . Kansas is going bye-bye!” I quick ly called him and he explained that he had indeed recovered the Starchild’ s nuclear DNA. It was a relativ ely easy recovery, meaning it had been there all along but was beyond the re ach of the long-chain, human-only primers that were the primary recovery protocol ava ilable before the 454 machines appeared in 2006, and well before the highly refined shot gunning technique he was currently using. His success was clear and unambiguous, dozens of sequences, 200 to 2000 base pairs long!"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 38  The graphic above is one of many gel sheets th at were recovered s howing the Starchild’s nuclear DNA. This group is among the few in the 1000 to 2000 base pair length, which is quite substantial. What mattered is that in ad dition to the few like th ese, many more of the shorter lengths were also f ound, lengths in the range of 200 to 500 base pairs long. The key discovery, though, was that the Starchild’s nucl ear DNA was there, intact, and it was viable. A 454 machine could recover the en tire 3 billion base pair genome in only 3 to 4 months! In 2003, the Starchild’s mitochondrial DNA was isolated, which proved it had a human mother. Also, since the majority of DNA in chimps, gorillas, and Neanderthals was like the DNA in humans, the majority of DNA in the Starchild should be human as well. The trick would be trying to tease out something that, when analyzed, would be different enough to clearly stand apart. So it came down to this critical question: How different could the Starchild’s nuclear DNA be? To answer that with scientific certainty, the result had to be go through the massive DNA database at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. It has 27 different Institutes located in 75 buildings spread over 300 acres. Its yearly budget is over $30 billion dollars. In the USA, the scientif ic buck stops with the NIH. They have the power and resources to control basic scientific research in America, and that is precisely what they do. They are the chokepoint for most DNA research."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 39  Over time, that database has accumulated thous ands of entire genomes. It contains over 150 different species types found on our planet. Naturally, the m illions of species that exist now can’t all be individually sequenced—ye t. However, nearly every species type is represented in it, from viruses to bacteria to crustaceans to mollusks to reptiles to primates to humans. It is remarkably inclusive, containing literally trillions of coherent strings of base pairs, which are recognizable in and of themselves rega rdless of their lengths, short or long. When our geneticist sent the Starchild sample s through the database, he hoped to find some differences that would be noticeable as distin ctive. With enough mark ers distinctive from humans, he would be able to calculate an approximate range of difference from normal humans. Remember, our hope was for something in the 3% - 5% range because if it would prove to be as different as chimps or goril las, nobody could possibly argue that it was some kind of freakazoid human deformity. Then the first reports from NIH started coming in. In the U.S., whenever a geneticist decides to recover a new entire genome, he or she must use one of the 454 machines, or other emerging techniques for recovering entire genomes. The cost of acquiring or using one of the genome-recovery machines is so prohibitive that usually it is paid for with a grant from the NIH. Because NIH funds all research with taxpaye r money, that legally puts the results of each recovery into the “public domain,” a gazillion-bit computer database with virtually limitless capacity."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 40   The preceding illustration is one of many similar results from the NIH database. It shows that this particular st ring was 265 base pairs long. In th e very last line of this report we see the result. The string has a perfect corollary on human chromosome 1. This meant there could be no doubt about the Trace Genetics findings in 2003. At least part of the Starchild was human, which wa s fully expected because its mitochondrial DNA—always from the female line—wa s typically human from Haplogroup C. But then came other reports, the ones that sent Dorothy and Kans as going “bye-bye.” The screen shot above displays the NIH an alysis of a string of 342 base pairs, a significant length in the 200-500 ba se pair bracket at the lower end of what has been recovered. Again, more than this one were recovered, but it is representative of all. “ No significant similarity found ” means some of the Starchild’s nuclear DNA cannot be found in the NI H database containing trillions of base pair segments from thousands of species on Earth. Feel fr ee to draw your own conclusions. . . . For reasons why, click here: This refers to a list of possible errors in the submission process. Our geneticist obtained the same results with multiple samples, so he has no doubt he did them correctly. As he and ma ny others say, “It’s not brain surgery.”"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 41  A different form of BLAST report shows there can be no doubt that at least some parts of the Starchild’s DNA are not present in the massively comprehensive NIH genomic database. For all intents and purposes, this can be taken to mean “not found on Earth.” Spectraphotometer readings for pure human DNA (a t left) and Starchild DNA (right). How this works is not important to know. It s importance is that it shows unmistakable evidence of innate humanity within the Star child’s nuDNA. Not near ly “perfect” in the ideal sense at left, something is considerably different about it; but it is well inside the ballpark of the graph, and further evidence fo r the Starchild ’s partially human nature."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 42   H - A Hybrid Human Neanderthal Chimpanzee Gorilla 99.95 – 99.99 % 97% 97% 97% 95% 90% 50% Starchild !!! Starchild !!! Electropherogram analysis of human DNA (at left) and Starchild DNA (right). How this works is also not important to know. Its value is that it shows the Starchild’s nuclear DNA being forced th rough a much finer filter, where its human qualities were quickly and thoroughly weeded out. In the graph at left, the fi rst vertical spike and the last one are the parameter brackets, seen in isolation in the second graph. These are the boundaries for the measurements being taken. At left are all the spikes that denote a normal human. With the Starchild’s nuDNA none of the internal spikes register. This surprising result again makes clear that pa rt of the Starchild is not human, and that part, whatever it is, will be a sign ificantly large percent of its genome. When I asked our geneticist what he felt the difference might be, he said that based on the percentages he was getting at this very early juncture, using an extremely small sample of roughly 30,000 base pairs, the percentage would probably fall in the range of 10% to 50% different from normal humans!"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 43    If such a wildly improbable amount of the Starchild genome is not from humans, how could it have a human mother? Our geneticist explained that when a human female suffers from badly diseased mitochondria, standard in vitro fertilization can make her pregnant with a child of her own and her mate’s, using a healthy egg donated by another woman. Thus, her offspring will have her and her mate’s nuclear DNA, but its mitochondrial DNA will be from the donor female and it will have DNA from three parents. Thus, the Starchild could have been created in a similar manner. Two alien parents could form a z ygote that is then put into th e egg of a human female, after which she gives birth to a genetically pure alien carrying human mitochondrial DNA. Don’t ask why this might have been done 900 years ago because we have no idea. We are simply trying to be real scientists who follow eviden ce regardless of where it leads. If mainstream scientists didn’t have to contend with the re bukes of conservative peers and Occam’s Razor applied by self-serving leaders, many more coul d join us in solving this unique mystery."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 44 SO, WHERE IS THE STARCHILD PROJECT NOW, 12 YEARS INTO IT, AT THE BEGINNING OF 2011?     Like Neil Armstrong’s famous first step ont o the surface of the Moon, which he rightly called “a giant leap for mankind,” we have taken a step of equal dimension with this first tentative foray into the genome of the Starchild Skull. We still have many more steps to take on the historic journey it promises for us all, but the outcome is no longer in doubt. This fantastic first step will lead us all into an entirely new concept of reality. Naturally, it will be resisted and fought outright by every vested interest in the world that stands to lose position or power by being forced to accept the idea of highly intelligent aliens interacting with our planet on an ongoing basi s. Nonetheless, that acceptance will happen, inevitably, and all of us will have to find our individual ways of coping with its profound meaning. However, before we go racing into our near future, we should be certain we understand exactly what has been accomplished thus far. Only a very tiny portion of the Starchild’s nuclear DNA (remember, from both parents) ha s been recovered and analyzed. We are talking roughly 30,000 base pairs of 3 billion , but more base pairs are being added all the time. Our short-term goal is extracting several hundred thousand to a few million using a recovery technique that empl oys a machine rather than th e laborious shotgun technique. Mainstream scientists will prot est that even a much larger sample is not enough to be conclusive , and they will be correct. However, what they won’t say in anything above a muted whisper is that it is sufficiently representative of the Starchild’s entire genome. To be conclusive we must recover the entire genome using the 454 technology, or the still newer Illumina technology, as other geneticists do with ot her unknown genomes. However, all of them are recovering the genomes of known terrestrial creatures , while our team will be recovering the incredible genome of what can only be called an extra terrestrial!"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 45 AFTER THAT FIRST BIG STEP INTO A NEW REALITY, WHAT COMES NEXT? WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?    First, we have to secure the investment funding needed to complete the recovery and analysis of the Starchild’s entire genome. Focus on the word investment . The enormous historic potential of th is unique research has turned it into a prime business deal. If it ever was a candidate for grant fundi ng, it no longer is. Now it can retu rn a great deal of money to the investor who decides to fund it. And that investment amounts to several million $. Once the investment funds are in place, even ts will unfold on two tracks. First, the lab where our geneticist is employed will be contracted to first recover the Starchild’s entire genome, which they feel will require 3 to 4 m onths, a relatively short period of time. This should provide a clear idea of how far away from human the Starchild will be, probably within a range of 5% in either direction. At this point we will formally announce to the world in a press conference that we ha ve definitive proof of alien reality. [ Note : For those who demand the name of our geneticist and his lab, both will be made public only after the funds are in place and the contracts have been signed. To announce them beforehand would subject them to the furious rebukes of less open-minded peers who much prefer that the “alien” controve rsy remain out of si ght and out of mind.] While the DNA recovery unfolds, we will shoot the first of two different documentary films. It will of course reco rd the recovery process, which will be interspersed with the Starchild’s back story, the numer ous events that took it from being discovered in Mexico, all the way up to the announcement of recovering its entire genome. Th at film will be in theaters about a year after we receive the investment funding that will be required. The second film will debut approximately one year after the first. It will follow the sequencing of the unknown parts of the Starch ild’s genome, which can take from eight months to a year depending on how much of it is new and unique. Interspersed with that process will be a wide array of interviews with people— some famous and some not— discussing how they feel about the profound shif t of humanity’s plac e in the universe. Finally, it is crucial for everyone to realize th at our geneticist and the team he will lead will be trekking off into unknown biological terrain, places no other geneticists have ever gone before. They understand the challenge they face, and they know full well that their work will be making history. So do I. A nd now, after completing this eBook, so do you. Please take what you’ve learne d here and share it with others who can tolerate such astounding information. I realize many people ar e too insecure about their fundamental beliefs to have them challenged in any wa y. However, those who can confront progress head-on will want to know a quantum leap is coming. When this news erupts worldwide, in a few weeks or a few months from now (December 2010), they will thank you for it."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Starchild Skull Essentials 46 ADDENDUM    For those who might be interested, here are some recent quotes sent to me in various emails from our geneticist as he tries to wend his way through the maze of never-before- seen data that he keeps discovering. I find it fascinating and maybe some of you will, too. Early November, 2010: Yesterday I completed DNA extractions from 1.8 g of SCSC (the human) and 0.45 g SC (the Starchild) bone pieces. I recovered about 8 ng from SC and about 25 ng from SCSC. Not enough to see by electrophoresis. SCSC DNA is somewhat co lored, which does not look good. The SC DNA is not colored, which is good, but there is 3 times less of it. 454 protocols recommend beginning with at least 500 ng of top quality DNA to make a good library that can be used for dozens of sequencing runs. As you see, I have about 60 times less of that for SC and 20 times less for SCSC. Despite that, I went one step further and made libraries using all I obtained from SC and SCSC. Also, I have remaining only about 2.5 g of SCSC and about 1 g of SC bone pieces, but I actually need at least 10 times that amount. [Note: The last comment eventually led to me personally cutting more bone from the human skull and the Starchild skull for the first time since they came into my care, in February of 1999. It was an amazing experience that I have chronicled elsewhere, but take it at this: the Starchild’s bone is very hard !!!] More early November, 2010 : Here is the latest. Attached are two documents illustrating that things look good so far. Libraries.pdf shows my electrophoretic analysis of the libraries I made from SC and SCSC DNA. I used a very sensitive electro phoretic analysis here. A library should show a smear between 500 and 1000 nucleotides. As you se e, both libraries show this smear, whic h means their preparation was successful. The SC DNA is somewhat less visible than SCSC, but it is visible, which is the most important aspect. Having seen that, I decided to quantify the libraries by measuring concentrations of their DNA in molecules per microliter (1/1,000,000 of a liter). It came out beautifully, mean ing I have measurable amounts of DNA! The export.pdf shows an Excel worksheet with calculations. A calibration curve came out beautifully linear, and both libraries are measurable w ithin the curve range. The SC library calculations are in red. Note the amount of DNA isolated from the SCSC sample was r oughly three times the SC’s, based on yesterday's measurements, and SC and SCSC libra ry concentrations came out near the same ratio. Good correlation. Early December, 2010: I did get many thousands of more raw sequences, which I could not accomplish in a year using the classic Sanger sequencing I did before . The problem is that these reads are spread all over the genome as small pieces, so it remains a helluva lot of straws scattered around . I can filter out bacterial sequences, which comprise more than 50% of those reads, and still I have dozens and dozens of either human-like sequences, or unmatched at NIH, but whic h are still too short to draw dramatic conclusions. A programmer who works for me is writing a special program to comp are SC sequences to the human genome, so this will also be interesting to see. I’ve been doing a lot of bioinformatics work, but my new dedicated workstation quickly ran out of its 8GB memory, so I can’t move further. I have ordered more memory to fill its 96GB capacity. This will be suffi cient, but it will not come earlier than mid-January. Mid-December, 2010: You might remember I mentioned a drawback specific to the 454 method which makes comparisons more difficult when sequences incl ude stretches of the same nucleotides. There are a great many such differences that are possible, su ch as a human sequence might contain TTTTTT and the matching SC sequence has TTTTT. This co uld be discarded as a read-out er ror, but it could also be treated as a difference and interpreted on the protein level, which could create confusion. Using this modality, it might be difficult to distinguish which is right. Th is is why I’m thinking the Illumina machine and its advanced technology might, in the long run, be better for our purposes. TO BE CONTINUED.......
