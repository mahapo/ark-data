But he begged him to leave h im a little of it. Yet he hearkened 3 not to him, but gulped down the whole; nor did it stay in his stomach, but came out of his mouth. And Adam said, 'Let us arise and go 4 and see what has happened to them. (I fear) lest the adversary may be assailing th em somewhere.' Chapter 3 1 And they both went and found Abel murdered.

'If this be so, tell me, (and) I will go and 2 bring thee fruit from paradise.
