Testament of Solomon, son of David, who was king in Jerusalem, and mastered and con trolled all spirits of the a ir, on the ea rth, and und er the ea rth. By means of them also he wrought all the transcendent works of t he Temple. Telling also o f the a uthorities they wield against men, and by what angels these demons are brough t to naught. Of the sage Solomon. Blessed art thou, O Lord God , who d idst give S olomon such authority. Glory to thee and might unto the ages. Amen. 2. And b ehold, when the Temple of the c ity of Jerusalem was being builded, and the a rtificers were working thereat, Ornias the demon came among them toward sunset; and he too k away half of the pay of the c hief - deviser's (?) littl e boy, as well as half his food . He a lso continued to suck the thu mb of his right hand every day. And the c hild grew thin, althou gh h e was very much loved by the king. 3. So King Solomon called the bo y one day, and questioned him, saying: \"Do I not love thee more than all the a rtisans who are working in the Temple of God ? Do I not give thee do uble wages and a do uble supp ly of food ? How is it that day by day and hour by hour thow growest thinner?\" 4. But the c hild s aid to the king: \"I pray thee, O king. Listen to what has befallen all that thy child hath. After we a re a ll released from our work on the Temple of God , after sunset, when I lie down to rest, one of the e vil demon s comes and takes away from me one half of my pay and o ne half of my food . Then h e a lso takes hold o f my right hand and sucks my thumb. And lo, my soul is op ressed, and so my bod y waxes thinner every day.\" 5. Now when I Solomon h eard this, I entered the Temple of God , and p rayed with all my soul, night and day, that the demon might be delivered into my h ands, and that I might gain authority over him. And it came a bo ut through my prayer that grace was given to me from the Lord Sabaoth by Michael his archangel. [He brough t me] a littl e ring, having a seal con sisting of an engraved stone, and said to me: \"Take, O Solomon, king, son of David, the gift which the Lord God has s ent thee, the highest Sabaoth. With it thou shalt l ock u p all demons of the earth, male and female; and with their help thou shal t bu ild up Jerusalem. [But] thou [must] wear this s eal of God . And this engraving of the seal of the ring sent thee is a Pentalpha.\" 6. And I Solomon was overjoyed, and p raised and glorified the God o f heaven and earth. And o n the morrow I called the boy, and gave him the ring, and said to him: \"take this, and at the hou r in which the demon shall come unto thee, throw this ring at the chest of the demon, and say to h im: 'In the name of God , King Solomon calls thee hither.' And then do thou come run ning to me, without having any misgivings or fear in respect of aught thou mayest hear on the part of the demon.\" 7. So the c hild too k the ring, and went off; and b ehold, at the customary hour Ornias, the fierce demon, came like a burning fire to take the pay fro m the child. But the c hild acc ording to the instruction s rece ived from the king, threw the ring at the c hest of the demon, and said: \"King Solomon calls thee hither.\" And then h e went off at a run to the king. But the demon cried o ut aloud, saying: \"Child, why h ast thou do ne this to me? Take the ring off me, and I will render to thee the gold o f the ea rth. Only take this off me, and forbear to lead me away to Solomon.\" 8. But the c hild said to the demon: \"As the Lord God o f Israel li veth, I will not broo k thee. So come hither.\" And the child came a t a run, rejoicing, to the king, and said: \"I have brought the demon, O king, as thou didst comm and me, O my master. And b ehold, he stands before the gates of the c ourt of thy palace , crying out, and supp licating with a loud voice; offering me the silver and gold o f the ea rth if I will only bring h im unto thee.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"9. And when Solomon h eard this, he rose up from his throne, and went outside into the vestibule of the court of his palace ; and there he saw the demon, sh udd ering and trembling. And he said to him: \"Who art thou?\" And the demon answered: \"I am called Ornias.\" 10 . And Solomon said to him: \"Tell me, O demon, to what zod iaca l sign thou art subject.\" And he answered: \"To the Water - po urer. And those who are c on sumed with desire for the nob le virgins upo n earth [...], these I strangle. But in case there is no d ispo sition to sleep, I am changed into three forms. Whenever men come to b e e namoured o f women, I metamorphose myself into a c omely female; and I take hold of the men in their sleep, and p lay with them. And after a while I again take to my wings, and hide me to the heavenly regions. I also app ear as a lion, and I am comm anded b y all the demon s. I am offspring of the archangel Uriel, the power of God .\" 11 . I Solomon, having h eard the name of the a rchangel, prayed and glorified God , the Lord o f heaven and earth. And I sealed the demon and set him to work at stone - cutting, so that he might cut the stones in the Temple, which, lying alon g the shore, had b een brou ght by the Sea of Arabia. But he, fearful of the iron, continued and said to me: \"I pray thee, King Solomon, let me go free; and I will bring you all t he demons.\" And as he was not willing to b e subject to me, I prayed the archangel Uriel to come a nd succo ur me; and I forthwith beheld the a rchangel Uriel coming down to me from the heavens. 12 . And the angel bade the whales of the sea c ome out of the abyss. And he ca st his destiny upo n the ground, and that [destiny] made subject [to him] the great demon. An d he c omm anded the great demon and bo ld Ornias, to cut stones at the Temple. And acc ordingly I Solomon g lorified the God o f heaven and Maker of the ea rth. And he bade Ornias come with his destiny, and gave him the seal, saying: \"Away with thee, and b ring m e hither the prince of all the demon s.\" 13 . So Ornias too k the finger - ring, and went off to Beelzebo ul, who has kingship o ver the demons. He said to him: \"Hither! Solomon calls thee.\" But Beelzebo ul, having h eard, said to him: \"Tell me, who is this Solomo n of whom thou speakest to me?\" Then Ornias threw the ring at the chest of Beelzebo ul, saying: \"Solomon the king calls thee.\" But Beelzebo ul cried aloud with a mighty v oice, and shot out a great burning flame of fire; and he arose, and followed Ornias, and came to Solomon. 14 . And when I saw the prince of demons, I glorified the Lord God , Maker of heaven and earth, and I said: \"Blessed art thou, Lord God Almighty, who hast given to Solomon thy servant wisdom, the assessor of the wise, and hast subjected un to me a ll the power of the devil.\" 15 . And I questioned him, and said: \"Who art thou?\" The demon replied: \"I am Beelzebub, the e xarch of the demon s. And all the demons have their chief seats close to me. And I it i s who make manifest the app arition of eac h demon.\" And he promised to b ring to me in bo nds all t he unclean spirits. And I again glorified the God o f heaven and earth, as I do always give thanks to him. 16 . I then asked o f the demon if there were females among them. And when h e told me that there were, I said that I desired to see them. So Beelzebo ul went off at high speed, and b rough t unto me Onoskelis, that had a very pretty shape, and the skin of a fair - hued woman; and she tossed her head. 17 . And when she was come, I said to her: \"Tell me who art thou?'' But she said to me: \"I am called Onoskelis, a spirit wroug ht ...[?shabtai/Saturn?], lurking u pon the ea rth. There is a golden cave where I lie. But I have a place that ever shifts. At one time I strangle men with a noo se; at another, I creep up from the nature to the a rms [in marg: \"worms\"]. But my most frequent dwelling - place s are the precipices, caves, ravines. Oftentimes, however, do I consort with men in the semblance of a woman, and abo ve a ll with those of a dark skin. For they share my sta r with me; since they it is who p rivily or op enly worship my star, without knowing that they harm themselves, and b ut whet my app etite for further mischief. For they wish to p rovide money by means of memory (comm emoration?), but I supp ly a little to those who worship me fairly.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"18 . And I Solomon questioned her abo ut her birth, and she replied: \"I was bo rn of a voice untimely, the so - called echo o f a man's ordure [1] dropped in a wood .\" [1. For the demon bo rn of an echo we have a n analog ue in the Hebrew B ath Kol, \"the daughter of a voice.\" In the Gnostic Hymn to Hermes, edited b y Dieterich, Abrasax, p 19 , we read, l. 104 ...] 19 . And I said to her: \"Under what star do st thou pass?\" And she a nswered me: \"Under the star of the full moon, for the reason that the moon travels over most things.\" Then I said to her: \"And what angel is it that frustrates thee?\" And she said to me: \"He that in thee [or \"through thee\"] is reigning.\" And I thought that she mocked me, and b ade a soldier strike her. But she c ried aloud , and said: \"I am [subjected] to thee, O king, by the wisdom of God given to thee, and by the angel Joel.\" 20 . So I comm anded her to spin the hemp for the rop es used in the building of the house of God ; and acc ordingly, when I had sealed and bo und her, she was s o o vercome a nd b rought to naught as to stand night and d ay spinning the hemp. 21 . And I at once bade a nother demon to b e led unto me; and instantly there a pp roached me the demon Asmod eus, bo und, and I asked him: \"Who art thou ?'' But he shot on me a glance of anger and rage, and said: \"And who art thou?'' And I said to him: \"Thus pu nished as thou art, answerest thou me?\" But he, with rage, said to me: \"But how shall I answer thee, for thou art a son of man; whereas I was bo rn an angel's seed b y a daug hter of man, so that no word o f our heavenly k ind add ressed to the ea rth - bo rn can be overweening. Wherefore a lso my star is bright in h eaven, and men call it , some the Wain, and some the dragon's child. I keep near unto this s tar. So ask me not many things ; for thy k ingdom also after a littl e time is to b e disrupted, and thy glory is but for a season. And short will be thy tyranny over us; and then we shall again h ave free range over mankind, so as that they shall revere us as if we were god s, not knowing, men that they are, the names of the a ngels s et over us.\" 22 . And I Solomon, on h earing this, bo und h im more ca refully, and o rdered him to b e flog ged with thon gs of ox - hide, and to tell me hu mbly what was his name and what his bu siness. And he answered me thus: \"I am called Asmod eus amon g mortals, and my bu siness is to plot against the newly wedd ed, so that they may not know one a nother. And I sever them utterly by many calamities, and I waste away the beauty of virgin women, and estrange their hearts.\" 23 . And I said to him: \"Is this thy only business?\" And he a nswered me: \"I transpo rt men into fits of madness and d esire, when they h ave wives of their own, so that they leave them, and go o ff by night and day to o thers that belon g to o ther men; with the res ult that they comm it sin, and fall into murderous deeds.\" 24 . And I adjured him by the name of the Lord Sabaôth, saying: \"Fear God , Asmod eus, and tell me by what angel thou art frustrated.\" But he said: \"By Raphael, the a rchangel that stands before the th rone of God . But the liver and gall of a fish pu t me to flight, when smoked ov er ashes of the tamarisk.\" I again asked him, and said: \"Hide not aught from me. For I am Solomon, son of David, King of Israel. Tell me the name of the fish which thou reverest. \" And he answered: \"It is the Glanos by name, and is found in the rivers of Assyria; wherefore it i s that I roam abo ut in those parts.\" 25 . And I said to him: \"Hast thou n othing else a bo ut thee, Asmod eus?\" And he a nswered: \"The po wer of God knoweth, which hath bou nd me with the indissoluble bonds of yonder one's s eal, that whatever I have told thee is true. I pray thee, King Solomon, condemn me not to [go into] water.\" But I smiled, and said to him: \"As the Lord God o f my fathers liveth, I will l ay iron on thee to wear. But thou shalt also make the clay for the entire c on struction o f the Temple, treading it do wn with thy feet.\" And I ordered them to give him ten water - jars to carry water in. And the demon g roaned terribly, and d id the work I ordered him to d o. And this I did, beca use that fierce demon Asmod eus knew even the future. And I Solomon g lorified God , who gave wisdom to me Solomon h is s ervant. And the liver of the fish and its gall I hu ng on the spike of a reed, and b urned it over Asmodeus beca use of his being so strong, and his unbearable malice was thus frustrated."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"26 . And I summoned again to stand b efore me Beelzebo ul, the prince of demons, and I sat him down o n a raised seat of honour, and said to him: \"Why art thou alone, prince of the demons?\" And h e said to me: \"Beca use I alone a m left of the a ngels of heaven that came do wn. For I was first angel in the first heaven being entitl ed Beelzebo ul. And now I control all t hose who are bo und in Tartarus. But I too have a c hild, and he haunts the Red Se a. And o n any suitable occa sion h e c omes up to me again, being subject to me; and reveals to me what he has do ne, and I suppo rt him. 27 . I Solomon said u nto him: \"Beelzebo ul, what is thy employment?\" And he a nswered me: \"I destroy king s. I ally myself wit h foreign tyrants. And my own d emons I set on to men, in order that the latter may believe in them and b e lost. And the c hosen servants of God, priests and faithful men, I excite unto d esires for wicked sins, and evil heresies, and lawless deeds; and they ob ey me, and I bear them on to d estruction. And I inspire men with envy, and [desire for] murder, and for wars and sod omy, and o ther evil t hings. And I will destroy the world.\" 28 . So I said to him: \"Bring to me thy child, who is, as thou sayest, in the R ed Sea.\" But he said to me: \"I will not bring h im to thee. But there shall come to me another demon called Ephipp as. Him will I bind, and he will bring him up from the deep unto me.\" And I said to him: \"How comes thy son to b e in the depth of the sea, and what is his name? \"And he a nswered me: \"Ask me not, for thou canst not learn from me. However, he will come to thee by any comm and, and will t ell thee op enly.\" 29 . I said to h im: \"Tell me by what angel thou art frustrated.\" And he a nswered: \"By the ho ly a nd p recious name of the Almighty God , called b y the Hebrews by a row of nu mbers, of which the sum is 644 , and amon g the Greeks it is Emm anuel [1]. And if one of the Romans adjure me by the great name of the power Eleéth, I disapp ear at once.\" [1. The text must be faulty, for the word Emm anuel is the Hebrew. The sum 644 is got by add ing together the Greek n umbers.] 30 . I Solomon was astounded when I heard this; and I ordered him to saw up Theban [1] marbles. And when h e began to saw the marbles, the other d emon s cried o ut with a loud voice, howling beca use of their king Beelzebo ul. [1. We hear of Pentelic marble in Strabo , but the reference in the text may be to Thebes in Egypt.] 31 . But I Solomon questioned him, saying: \"If thou wouldst gain a respite, di scourse to me abo ut the things in h eaven.\" And Beelzebo ul said: \"Hear, O king, if thou burn gu m, and incense, and b ulb o f the sea [1], with n ard and saffron, and light seven lamps in an earthquake [2], thou wilt firmly fix thy house. And if, being pure [3] , thou light them at dawn in the sun alight, then wilt thou see the heavenly dragons, how they wind themselves alon g and d rag the chariot of the sun.\" [1. Perhaps the \"sea - bulbs\" were the balls of hair - like texture which the sea washes up o n Mediterranean shores, e.g. in Tunisia. 2. Perhaps \"in a row,\" should b e read. 3. For the c ondition h ere insisted o n cp. Dieterich, Abrasax, p. 141 , where in an incantation ceremonial purity is s imilarly insisted on. The ritual of a magic papyrus given by Dieterich, p. 16 9, is very similar to that here prescribed in the Testament.] 32 . And I Solomon, having h eard this, rebuked him, and said: \"Silence for this present [1], and continue to saw the marbles as I comm and ed thee.\" And I Solomon praised God , and comm anded anot her demon to present himself to me. And on e c ame before me who carried his face high u p in the a ir, but the rest of the spirit curled away like a snail. And it broke throu gh the few soldiers, and raised also a terrible dust on the ground, and carried it up wards; and then again hurled it back to frighten u s, and asked what question s I could ask as a rule. And I stood up, and spat [2] on the ground in that spo t, and sealed with the ring of God . And forthwith the du st - wind stopp ed. Then I asked h im, saying: \"W ho art thou, O wind?\" Then h e once more shoo k u p a dust, and answered me: \"What wouldst thou h ave, King Solomon?\" I answered him: \"Tell"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"me what thou art called, and I would fain ask thee a question . But so far I give thanks to God who has made me wise to a nswer their evil plots.\" [1. So Luke xxii. 51 . 2. For the use of spittle to p rod uce a c ure or other effect in a magical way, cp. Mark vii. 33 and viii. 23 . In John ix. 6, Jesus, we read, \"spat on the ground, and made c lay of the spittl e, and anointed the eyes with the c lay.\" Of this magic use of spittle Pliny, in h is Natural History, gives nu merous examples. It was comm on in antiquity.] 33 . But [the demon] answered me: \"I am the spirit of the a shes (Tephras).\" And I said to him: \"What is thy pursuit?\" And he said: \"I bring darkness on men, and set fire to fields; and I bring h omesteads to naught. But most busy am I in summer. However, when I get an oppo rtunity, I creep into corners of the wall, by night and d ay. For I am offspring of the great one, and not hing less.\" Accordingly I said to him: \"Under what star do st thou lie?\" And he a nswered: \"In the very tip o f the moon's horn, when it is fou nd in the south. There is my star. For I have been bidd en to restrain the c onvulsion s of the hemitertian fever; and this is why many men pray to the hemitertian fever, using these three names: Bultala, Thallal, [24 ] Melchal. And I heal them.\" And I said to him: \"I am Solomon ; when therefore thou wouldst do harm, by whose a id do st thou do it?\" But he said to me: \"By the angel's, by whom also the third d ay's fever is lulled to rest.\" So I questioned him, and said: \"And by what name [1]?\" And h e a nswered: \"That of the a rchangel Azael.\" And I summ oned the a rchangel Azael, and set a seal on the demon, and comm anded him to sei ze great stones, and toss them up to the workmen on the higher parts of the Temple. And, being compelled, the demon began to do what he was bidd en to do . [1. Cp. Acts iv. 7.] 34 . And I glorified God afresh who gave me this authority, and o rdered another d emon to come before me. And there c ame seven spirits [1], females, bou nd and woven together, fair in app earance a nd comely. And I Solomon, seeing them, questioned them and said: \"Who are ye?\" But they, with one acc ord, said with one voice [2]: \"We a re of t he thirty - three e lements of the c osmic ruler of the darkness [3].\" And the first said: \"I am Dece ption.\" The second said: \"I am Strife.\" The third: \"I am Klothod , which is battle.\" The fourth: \"I am Jealousy.\" The fifth: \"I am Power.\" The sixth: \"I am Erro r.\" The seventh: \"I am the worst of all, and o ur stars are in h eaven. Seven stars hu mble in sheen, and all t og ether. And we a re ca lled as it were godd esses. We c hange our place a ll and together, and together we live, sometimes in Lydia, sometimes in Olympu s, sometimes in a great mou ntain.\" [1. The Pleiades s eem to b e referred to. Cp. Job xxx viii. 31 , in the Revised Version : \"Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades?\" They had a malign influence. The grouping of evil spirits by sevens is comm on in Babylo nian and Jewish folk - lore. As examples I may cite the Testamentum of Reuben, ch. 2, and the seven evil spirits of the N.T. Possibly, however, the Seven Planets are here in question; thou gh this is unlikely, for they do not tally with the description g iven. 2. Rom. xv. 6 has the same phrase. For \"thirty - three\" we should read \"thirty - six\" elements. Note that later in the Testament these seven spirits are not amon g the Kosmokrators, a proo f that the do cument before us is a c omposite one. 3. Paul speaks of the Kosmokrators in Eph. vi. 12 : \"Our wrestling is not against flesh and b lood , but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world - rulers of this darkness.\" See Iren. Haer. I. i. 10.] 35 . So I Solomon questioned them one by one, beginning w ith the first, and going down to the seventh. The first said: \"I am Dece ption, I dece ive a nd weave snares here a nd there. I whet and excite heresies. But I have an angel who frustrates me, Lamechalal.\" 36 . Likewise a lso the second said: \"I am Strife, stri fe of strifes. I bring timbers, stones, hangers, my weapon s on the spo t. But I have a n angel who frustrates me, Baruchiachel.\" 37 . Likewise a lso the third said: \"I am called Klothod [1], which is Battle, and I cause the well - behaved to scatter and fall fou l one of the other. And why do I say so much? I have an angel that frustrates me: \"Marmarath.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"[1. Fabricius, Cod . Pseudepigr. V.T. vol. I, p. 1047 , reads Klothon, which must be i.q. Klud un, which Hesychius explains thu s: ...] 38 . Likewise a lso the fourt h said: \"I cause men to forget their sob riety and mod eration. I part them and split them into p arties; for Strife follows me hand in h and. I rend the husband from the sharer of his bed, and children from parents, and b rothers from sisters. But why tell so much to my despite? I have a n angel that frustrates me, the great Balthial.\" 39 . Likewise a lso the fifth said: \"I am Power. By power I r aise up tyrants and tear down k ings. To all rebels I furnish power. I have an ang el that frustrates me, Asteraôth.\" 40 . Likewise a lso the sixth said: \"I am Error [1], O K ing Solomon. And I will make thee to err, as I have before made thee to err, when I caused thee to slay thy own brother [2]. I will lead you into error, so as to pry into graves [3]; and 1 teac h them that dig, and I lead errant sou ls away from all piety, and many other evil t raits are mine. But I have an angel that frustrates me, Uriel.\" [1. Cp. Testam. of Symeon, ch. 3. 2. See I Kings ii. 25 . 3. A reference to necromancy, of which the ob ject was to ob lig e the spirit of the dead to enter oneself.] 41 . Likewise a lso the seventh said: \"I am the worst, and I make thee worse off than thou wast; beca use I will impo se the bo nds of Artemis. But the locust [1] will set me free, for by means thereof is it fated th at thou shalt achieve my desire [...]. For if one were wise, he would not turn h is s teps toward me.\" [1. This refers to the c losing incident narrated in the Testament, the sacrificing by Solomon of five locusts to Moloch. Tatian, Orat. ad Graec os, cap. 12 , speaks of Artemis magos. She is the same a s Heca te.] 42 . So I Solomon, having h eard and wondered, sealed them with my ring; and since they were so considerable, I bade them dig the foundations of the Temple of God . For the length of it was 250 cubits. A nd I bade them be indu striou s, and with one murmur of joint protest they began to p erform the tasks enjoined. 43 . But I Solomon glorified the Lord, and b ade a nother demon come before me. And there was brou ght to me a demon h aving all the limbs of a man, b ut without a head. And I, seeing h im, said to h im: \"Tell me, who art thou?'' And he answered: \"I am a demon.\" So I said to him: \"Which?\" And he answered me: \"I am called Envy. For I delight to d evour heads, being desirou s to secure for myself a head; but I do not eat enou gh, bu t am anxious to have such a head as thou h ast.\" 44 . I Solomon, on h earing this, sealed him, stretching out my h and against his chest. Whereon the demon leapt up, and threw himself do wn, and gave a groan, saying: \"Woe is me! where am I come to? O traitor Ornias, I cannot see!\" So I said to him: \"I am Solomon. Tell me then h ow thou do st manage to see.\" And he answered me: \"By means of my feelings.\" I then, Solomon, having h eard his voice c ome up to me, asked him how he managed to speak. And he a nswered me: \"I, O K ing Solomon, am wholly voice, for I have inherited the voices of many men. For in the ca se of all men who are ca lled du mb, I it i s who smashed their heads, when they were children and had reac hed their eighth d ay. Then when a ch ild is crying in the night, I become a spirit, and glide by means of his voice [...]. In the c rossways [1] also I have many services to render, and my encou nter is fraught with h arm. For I grasp in all i nstant a man's head, and with my h ands, as with a swo rd, I cut it off, and p ut it on to myself. And in this way, by means of the fire which is in me, throu gh my neck it i s swallowed up. I it i s that sends grave mutilations and incurable on men's feet, and inflict sores.\" [1. This s eems the sense of enod iais , unless understood , trivialibus dis, \"to the demons of the wayside or cross - road.\" Heca te was s uch a godd ess, and in C.I. 26 we have mention of a daimon enod ia, the Latin Trivia.

And I Solomon, on h earing this, said to him: \"Tell me how thou do st discharge forth the fire? Out of what sources do st thou emit it?\" And the spirit said to me: \"From the Day - star [1]. For here hath n ot yet been fou nd that Elburion, to who m men offer prayers and kindle lights. And his name is invoked by the seven demon s before me. And he c herishes them.\" [1. Or, \"from the Orient.\"] 46 . But I said to him: \"Tell me his name.\" But he a nswered: \"I cannot tell t hee. For if I tell his name, I re nder myself incurable. But he will come in respon se to his name.\" And o n h earing this, I Solomon said to him: \"Tell me then, by what angel thou art frustrated?\" And he a nswered: \"By the fiery flash of lightning.\" And I bo wed myself before the Lord God o f I srael, and b ade him remain in the keeping of Beelzebo ul until Iax [1] should come. [1. Bornemann conjectures \"a guardian or watcher.\" But the a ngel Iax recurs below in # 86 .] 47 . Then I ordered another demon to come before me, and there c ame into my pres ence a hou nd, having a very large shape, and it spo ke with a loud voice, and said, \"Hail, Lord, King Solomon !\" And I Solomon was astou nded. I said to it: Who art thou, O hound?\" And it answered: \"I do indeed seem to thee to b e a hou nd, but before thou wast , O K ing Solomon, I was a man that wrou ght many unholy deeds on earth. I was surpassingly learned in letters, and was s o mighty that I could hold the stars of heaven back. And many divine works did I prepare.

Can it mean \"her that is bo rn of echo\" (see a bo ve, p. 19 , n. 8).?] 48 . And I Solomon said to him: \"What is thy n ame?\" And he a nswe red: ''Staff\" (Rabdo s). And I said to him: \"What is thine employment? And what results canst tho u achieve?\" And he replied: ''Give me thy man, and I will lead him away into a mou ntainou s s po t, and will show him a green stone tossed to and fro, with which t hou mayest ado rn the temple of the Lord God .\" 49 . And I Solomon, on h earing this, ordered my servant to set off with h im, and to take the finger - ring bearing the seal of God with him. And I said to him: \"Whoever shall show thee the green stone, seal him w ith this finger - ring. And mark the spo t with care, and b ring me the demon hither. And the demon showed him the green stone, and he sealed it, and b rough t the demon to me. And I Solomon decided to confine with my seal on my right hand the two, the headless demon, likewise the hou nd, that was s o h uge [1]; he should be bo und as well. And I bade the hound keep safe the fiery spirit so that lamps as it were might by day and night cast their light through its maw on the a rtisans at work. [1. The text seems corru pt here.] 50 . And I Solomon too k from the mine of that stone 200 shekels for the suppo rts of the table of incense, which was similar in app earance. And I Solomon g lorified the Lord God , and then closed round the treasure of that stone. And I ordered afres h the demons to cut marble for the c onstruction of the hou se of God . And I Solomon prayed to the Lord, and asked the hou nd, saying: \"By what angel art thou frustrated?\" And the demon replied: \"By the great Brieus [1].\" [1. Briareus is suggested by Bornema nn as the right reading, but with little prob abilit y, since Briareus would not have been turned into an angel.] 51 . And I praised the Lord God o f heaven and earth, and b ade a nother demon come forward to me; and there c ame before me one in the form of a li on roaring. And he stood and answered me saying: \"O king, in the form which I have, I am a spirit quite incapable of being perceived.

What angel is it that frustrates thee?\" And he a nswered: \"If I tell t hee my n ame, I bind not myself alone, but also the legions of demon s under me.\" [1. dektikos s eems here to b ear this s ense, as also in the fragment of a very old comm entary on the Shepherd o f Hermas in the Oxyrhynchus papyri. part i, by Grenfell and Hunt, 1898 , p. 9.

So I said to him: \"I adjure thee in the name of the God Sabaoth, to tell me by wh at name thou art frustrated along with thy host.\" And the spirit answered me: \"The 'great among men,' who is to suffer many things at the hands of men, whose name is the figure 644 , which is Emmanuel; he it i s who has bou nd us, and who will then come a nd p lunge us from the steep [1] und er water.

And I Solomon, on h earing this, glorifie d God , and condemned his legion to carry wood from the thicket. And I condemned the lion - shaped o ne himself to saw up the wood small with h is teeth, for burning in the unquenchable furnace for the Temple of God . 54 . And I worshipp ed the Lord God o f Israel, and b ade a nother demon come forward. And there c ame before me a dragon, three - headed, of fearful hue.

And I ado red the Lord God o f Israel, and b ade a nother demon present himself. And there ca me before me a spirit i n woman's form, that had a head without any limbs [1], and her hair was dishevelled. And I said to her: \"Who art thou?\" But sh e a nswered: \"Nay, who art thou?

And I Solomon did as s he e njoined me, and restrained myself beca use of the wisdom dwelling in me [1]; in order that I migh t hear of her deeds, and reprehend them, and manifest them to men. And I sat down, and said to the demon : \"What art thou?\" And she said: \"I am called among men Obizuth; and by night I sleep not, but go my rou nds over all t he world, and visit women in child birth.

When I Solomon h eard this, I marvelled at her app earance, for I beheld all her bod y to b e in darkness. But her glance was altogether bright and greeny, and her hair was tossed wildly like a drago n's; and the who le of her limbs were invisible. And her voice was very clear as it came to me. And I cunn ingly said: \"Tell me by what an gel thou art frustrated, O evil spirit?\" By she a nswered me: \"By the angel of God called Afarôt, which is interpreted Raphael, by whom I am frustrated now and for all t ime. His name, if any man know it, and write the same on a woman in childb irth, then I s hall not be a ble to enter her. Of this name the number is 640 [1].\" And I Solomon h aving h eard this, and h aving g lorified the Lord, ordered her hair to b e bo und, and that she shou ld b e hun g u p in front of the Temple of God ; that all t he children of Israel, as they passed, might see it, and glorify the Lord God o f Israel, who had given me this authority, with wisdom and power from God , by means of this s ignet.

And I again ordered another demon to come before me. And the c ame, rolling itself along, one in app earance like to a dragon, but having the face a nd hands of a man. And all i ts limbs, except the feet, were t hose of a dragon; and it had wings on its back. And when I beheld it, I was astonied, and said: \"Who art thou, demon, and what art thou called? And whence hast thou come? Tell me.\" 61 . And the spirit answered and said: \"This is the first time I have stood before the, O K ing Solomon. I am a spirit made into a god among men, but now brou ght to naught by the ring and wisdom vo uchsafed to thee by God . Now I am the so - called winged d ragon [1], and I chamber not with many women, but only with a few that are of f air shape, which po ssess the name of xuli, of this s tar. And I pair with them in the guise of a spirit winged in form, coitum habens per nates. And she on whom I have leapt goes heavy with child, and that which is bo rn of her becomes eros.

And as the demon said this, I saw the spirit going forth from his mouth, and it con sumed the wood o f the frankincense - tree, and b urned up all t he logs which we had p lace d in the Temple of God.

And, having g lorified God , I asked the dragon - shaped d emon, and said: \"Tell me, by what angel art thou frustrated?\" And he answered: \"By the great angel which h as its s eat in the second heaven, which is called in Hebrew Bazaze th. And I Solomon, having h eard this, and having invoked his ang el, condemned him to saw up marbles for the building of the Temple of God; and I praised God , and comm anded another demon to come before me. 64 . And there c ame before my face a nother spirit, as it were a woman in the form she had. But on h er shou lders s he had two o ther heads with h ands. An d I asked her, and said: \"Tell me, who art thou?\" And she said to me: \"I am Enêpsigos, who also have a myriad names.\" And I said her: \"By what angel art thou frustrated?\" But she said to me: \"What seekest, what askest thou?

But since thou art before me for this much, hearken. I have my abod e in the moon, and for that reason I po ssess thre e forms. At times I am magically [1] invoked by the wise a s Kronos. At other times, in connexion with those who b ring me down, I come down and app ear in another shape. The measure of the e lement [2] is inexplicable and ind efinable, and not to b e frustrated . I then, changing into these three forms, come down and b ecome such as thou seest me; but I am frustrated by the angel Rathanael, who sits in the third heaven. This then is why I speak to thee. Yonder temple ca nnot contain me.\" [1. mageyoméne. 2. Perhaps \"the place or size of the heavenly bod y.\"] 65 . I therefore Solomon prayed to my God , and I invoked the a ngel of whom Enépsigos s poke to me, and used my seal. And I sealed her with a triple c hain, and (place d) beneath h er the fastening of the c hain. I use d the seal of God , and the spirit prophesied to me, saying: \"This is what thou, King Solomon, do est to us. But after a time thy k ingdo m shall be broken, and again in season this Temple shall be riven asunder [1]; and all Jerusalem shall be undo ne by the Ki ng of the Persians and Medes and Chaldaeans. And the vessels of this Temple, which thou makest, shall be put to servile uses of the god s; and along with them all the jars, in which thou do st shut us up, shall be broken by the hands of men. And then we shal l go forth in great power hither and thither, and b e disseminated all over the world. And we shall l ead astray the inhabited world for a long season, until the Son of God is s tretched upo n the c ross. For never before do th arise a king like unto h im, one fr ustrating us all, whose mother shall not have c ontact with man.

Wherefore , O K ing Solomon, thy time is evil, and thy years s hort and evil, and to thy servant shall thy kingdom be given [3].\" [1. I conjecture the sense which the word must bear in this context. 2. xmd. 3. This prop hecy correspo nds roughly to the one which Lactan tius, Instit. Div. lib. iv. c. 18 , quotes from an apo cryphal Boo k of Solomon.] 66 . And I Solomon, having h eard this, glorified God . And tho ugh I marvelled at the a po log y of the demon s, I did not credit it until it came true. And I did not believe their wo rds; but when they were realized, then I understood , and at my death I wrote this Testament to the children of Israel, and gave it t o them, so that they might know the powers of the demons and their shapes, and the names of their angels, by which these ang els are frustrated. And I glorified the Lord God o f Israel, and comm anded the spirits to b e bo und with bo nds indissoluble. 67 . And having praised God , I comm anded another spirit t o come before me; and there ca me before my face a nother demon, having in fron t the shape of a horse, but behind o f a fish. And he had a mighty v oice, and said to me: \"O K ing Solomon, I am a fierce spirit of the sea, and I am greedy of gold and silver.

But since Beelzebo ul, ruler of the spirits of air and o f those under the ea rth, and lord o f earthly ones, hath a joint kingship with us in respect of the deeds of eac h one of us, therefore I went up from the sea, to get a ce rtain outloo k [2] in h is company.

And there c ame before my face a nother enslaved spirit, having ob scurely the form of a man, with gleaming eyes, and b earing in h is hand a blade. And I asked: \"Who art thou? But he a nswered: \"I am a lascivious s pirit, engendered o f a giant man who d ies in the massacre in the time of the giants.\" I said to him: \"Tell me what thou art employed o n u po n earth, and where thou h ast thy dwelling.\" 71 . And he said: \"My dwelling is in fruitful place s, but my procedure is this.

And I comm anded them to fetch water in the Temple of God . And I furthermore prayed to the Lord God to cause the demons withou t, that hamper hu manity, to b e bo und and made to app roach the Temple of God . Some of these demon s I condemned to do the heavy work of the c on struction of the Temple of God . Others I shut up in prison s. Others I ordered to wrestle with fire in (the making of) gold and silver, sitting down by lead and spoo n. And to make ready place s for the other demons in which they should b e c onfined. 108 . And I Solomon h ad much quiet in all the ea rth, and spent my life in profound p eace , honoured by all me n and by all under heaven. And I built t he entire Temple of the Lord God . And my k ingdo m was prosperous, and my army was with me. And for the rest the city of Jerusalem had repo se, rejoicing and delighted. And all t he king s of the ea rth came to me from the ends of the ea rth to b ehold the Temple which I builded to the Lord God . And having h eard o f the wisdom given to me, they did homage to me in the Temple, bringing g old and silver and p recious s tones, many and d ivers, and b ronze, and iron, and lead, and ced ar logs. And wood s decay not they brought me, for the equipment of the Temple of God."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"109 . And amon g them also the queen of the South, being a witch, came in g reat concern and bo wed low before me to the ea rth. And having h eard my wisdom, she glorified the God o f Israel, and she made formal trial of all my wisdom, of all love in which I instructed her, acc ording to the wisdom imparted to me. And all t he sons of Israel glorified God . 110 . And b ehold, in those days one of the workmen, of ripe old age, threw h imself down before me, and said: \"King Solomon, pity me, beca use I am old.\" So I bade him stand up, and said: \"Tell me, old man, all you will.\" And he answered: \"I beseec h you k ing, I have a n only - bo rn son, and he insults and b eats me op enly, and p lucks ou t the hair of my head, and threatens me with a painful death. Therefore I beseec h you avenge me. 111 . And I Solomon, on h earing this, felt compunction as I loo ked at his old age; and I bade the c hild b e brough t to me. And when h e was brought I questioned h im whether it were true. And the youth said: \"I was not so filled with madness as to strike my father with my h and. Be kind to me, O king. For I have not dared to comm it such impiety, poo r wretch that I am.\" But I Solomon on h earing this from the youth, ex horted the old man to reflect on the matter, and acce pt his s on 's apo log y. However, he would not, but said he would rather let him die. And as the old man would not yield, I was abo ut to p ronounce sentence on the youth, when I saw Ornias the demon laug hing . I was very angry at the demon's laughing in my presence; and I ordered my men to remove the other parties, and b ring forward Ornias before my tribunal. And when he was brought before me, I said to him: \"Accursed o ne, why didst thou loo k at me and laugh?\" And the demon answered: \"Prithee, king, it was not beca use of thee I laughed, but beca use of this ill - starred o ld man and the wretched you th, his s on. For after three days his s on will die untimely; and lo, the old man desires to foully make away with him .\" 112 . But I Solomon, having heard this, said to the demon: \"Is that true that thou speakest?\" And he answered: \"It is true; O king.\" And I, on h earing that, bade them remove the demon, and that they should again bring before me the old man with h is s on. I bade them [40 ] make friends with one a no ther again, and I supp lied them with food . And then I told the old man after three days to b ring h is s on again to me here; \"and,\" said I, \"I will attend to him.\" And they saluted me, and went their way. 113 . And when they were gon e I ordered Ornias to b e brough t forward, and said to him: \"Tell me how you know this;\" and he a nswered: \"We demon s ascend into the firmament of heaven, and fly abo ut amon g the stars. And we hear the sentences which g o forth u po n the soul s of men, and forthwith we come, and whether by force of influence, or by fire, or by sword, or by some acc ident, we veil our act of destruction ; and if a man do es not die by some untimely disaster or by violence, then we demon s transform ourselves in such a way as to app ear to men and b e worshipp ed in our hu man n ature.\" 114 . I therefore, having h eard this, glorified the Lord God , and again I questioned the demon, saying: \"Tell me how ye ca n ascend into heaven, being demons, and amidst the stars and holy a ngels intermingle.\" And he a nswered: \"Just as things are fulfilled in h eaven, so also o n earth (are fulfilled) the types [1] of all of them. For there a re principalities, authorities, world - rulers [2], and we demon s fly abo ut in the a ir; and we hear the vo ices of the heavenly beings, and survey all the po wers. And as having n o ground (basis) on which to alight and rest, we lose strength and fall off like leaves from trees. And men seeing us imagine that the stars are falling from heaven. But it is not reall y so, O king; but we fall beca use of our weakness, and b eca use we have nowhere anything to lay h old o f; and so we fall down like lightnings [3] in the depth of night and sudd enly. And we set cities in flames and fire the fields. For the stars have firm fou ndations in the heavens like the sun and the moo n.\" [1. Cp. Heb. viii. 5. 2. Cp. Rom. viii. 38 . 3. Luke x. 18 : \"I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.\" June 13 .] 115 . And I Solomon, having heard this, ordered the demon to b e guarded for five days. And after the five days I reca lled the old man, and was abo ut to q uestion h im. But he c ame to me in g rief and with black face . And I said to him: \"Tell me, old man, where is thy son? And what means this garb?\" And he a nswered:"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"\"Lo, I am become c hildless, and sit by my son 's grave in despair. For it i s already two d ays that he is dead.\" But I Solomon, on h earing that, and knowing that the demon Ornias had told me the truth, glorified the God of Israel. 116 . And the queen of the Sou th saw all this, and marv elled, [41 ] glorifying the God o f Israel; and she beheld the Temple of the Lord b eing builded. And she gave a siklos [1] of gold and o ne hu ndred myriads of silver and choice bronze, and she went into the Temple. And (she beheld) the a ltar of incense and th e braze n suppo rts of this altar, and the gems of the lamps flashing forth of different colours, and o f the lamp - stand o f stone, and o f emerald, and h yacinth, and sapp hire; and she beheld the vessels of go ld, and silver, and b ronze, and wood , and the folds of skins dyed red with madd er. And she saw the bases of the pillars of the Temple of the Lord. All were of one gold ... [2] apart from the demons whom I condemned to labo ur. And there was peace in the c ircle of my k ingdom and o ver all the ea rth. [1. A she kel. Philo has the form síklos, i. 468 . síglos is the usual spelling in the LXX . 2. There seems to b e here a lacuna in the MS.] 117 . And it came to p ass, which I was in my k ingdom, the King of the Arabians, Adares, sent me a letter, and the writing of the letter was written as follows: -- \"To King Solomon, all hail! Lo, we have heard, and it hath been h eard u nto all t he ends of the ea rth, concerning the wisdom vouchsafed in thee, and that thou art a man merciful from the Lord. And understanding h ath been granted thee over all t he spirits of the a ir, and o n earth, and u nder the ea rth. Now, forasmuch as there is present in the land o f Arabia a spirit of the following k ind: at early dawn there begins to b low a ce rtain wind until the third hour. And its blast is harsh and terrible, and it slays man and b east. And no spirit can live upo n earth against this demon. I pray thee then, forasmuch as the spirit i s a wind, contrive something acc ording to the wisdom given in thee by the Lord thy God , and d eign to send a man able to capture it. And b ehold, King Solomon, I and my peop le a nd all my land will serve thee unto d eath. And all Arabia shall be a t peace with thee, if thou wilt perform this act of righteousness for us. Wherefore we pray thee, contemn n ot our humble prayer, and suffer not to b e utterly brought to naugh t the e parchy subo rdinated to thy authority. Beca use we a re supp liants, bo th I and my peop le a nd all my land. Farewell t o my Lord. All health!\" 118 . And I Solomon read this epistle; and I folded it up a nd gave it t o my peop le, and said to them: \"After seven days s halt thou remind me of this epistle. And Jerusalem was bu ilt, and the Temple was being completed. And there was a stone [1], the e nd stone of the c orner lying there, great, chosen out, one which I desired lay in the head o f the corner of the c ompletion of the Temple. And all the workmen, and all t he demons helping them came to the same place to b ring u p the stone a nd lay it on the pinnacle of the holy Temple, and were not stron g enou gh to stir it , and lay it upo n the c orner allotted to it. For that stone was excee dingly great and useful for the c orner of the Temple.\" [1. Cp. I Pet. ii. 6, 7, who combines in the same way Ps. cxviii. 22 and Isa. xxv iii. 16 . Cp. Matt. xxi. 42 , Mark x ii, 10 , Luke xx, 17 .] 119 . And after seven days, being reminded o f the e pistle of Adares, King of Arabia, I called my servant and said to him: \"Order thy camel and take for thyself a leather flask, and take a lso this s eal. And go away into Arabia to the place in which th e e vil spirit blows; and there take the flask, and the signet - ring in front of the mouth of the flask, and (hold them) towards the blast of the spirit. And when the flask is blown out, thou wilt understand that the demon is (in it). Then h astily tie up the mouth of to flask, and seal it securely with the seal - ring, and lay it carefully on the c amel and b ring it me hither. And if on the way it offer thee gold o r silver or treasure in return for letting it go, see that thou be no t persuaded. But arrange witho ut using oath to release it. And then if it po int out to the place s where a re gold o r silver, mark the places and seal them with this s eal. And b ring the demon to me. And now depart, and fare thee well.\""},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"120 . Then the you th did as was bidd en h im. And he o rdered his camel, and laid o n it a flask, and set off into Arabia. And the men of that region would not believe that he wou ld b e a ble to catch the e vil spirit. And when it was dawn, the servant stood b efore the spirit's blast, and laid the flask on the gro und , and the finger - ring on the mouth of the flask. And the demon blew through the midd le of the finger - ring into the mouth of the flask, and going in blew out the flask. But the man promptly stood up to it and d rew tight with his hand the mouth of the fla sk, in the name of the Lord God o f Sabaôth. And the demon remained within the flask. And after that the youth remained in that land three days to make trial. And the spirit no longer blew against that city. And all t he Arabs knew that he had safely shut in the spirit. 121 . Then the you th fastened the flask on the c amel, and the Arabs s ent him forth on h is way with much honour and p recious gifts, praising and magnifying the God o f Israel. But the youth brought in the bag and laid it i n the midd le of the Tem ple. And o n the next day, I King Solomon, went into the Temple of God and sat in deep d istress abo ut the stone of the end o f the c orner. And when I entered the Temple, the flask stood up and walked arou nd some seven steps and then fell on its mouth and d id homage to me. And I marvelled that even alon g with the bo ttle the demon still had p ower and could walk abo ut; and I comm anded it t o stand up. And the flask stood up, and stood o n its feet all blown out. And I questioned him, saying: \"Tell me, who art thou ?\" And the spirit within said: \"I am the demon called Ephipp as, that is in Arabia.\" And I said to him: \"Is this thy n ame?\" And he a nswered: \"Yes; wheresoever I will, I alight and set fire a nd do to death.\" 122 . And I said to him: \"By what angel art thou f rustrated?\" And he answered: \"By the only - ruling God , that hath authority over me e ven to b e heard. He that is to b e bo rn of a virgin and crucified b y the Jews on a cross. Whom the angels and archangels worship. He do th frustrate me, and enfeeble me of my great strength, which h as been given me by my father the devil.\" And I said to him: \"What canst thou do ?'' And he a nswered: ''I am able to remove [1] mou ntains, to o verthrow the oaths of kings. I wither trees and make their leaves to fall off.\" And I said to him: \"Canst thou raise this s tone, and lay it for the beginning of this corner which exists in the fair plan of the Temple [2]?'' And he said: \"Not only raise this, O king; but also, with the help o f the demon who p resides over the Red Sea, I will bring up the pillar of air [3], and will stand it where thou wilt in Jerusalem.'' [1. Cp. the faith which removes mou ntains. 2. Bornemann suggests that the gate of the Temple ca lled Beautiful (Acts iii. 2, 10 ) is referred to. 3. I conjecture the sense.] 123 . Saying this, I laid stress on h im, and the flask became as if depleted o f air. And I place d it under the stone, and (the spirit) girded himself up, and lifted it up top o f the flask. And the flask went up the steps, carrying the stone, and laid it down at the e nd o f the e ntrance of the Temple. And I Solomon, beholding the stone raised aloft and p lace d on a fou ndation, said: \"Truly the Scripture is fulfilled, which says: 'The stone which the bu ilders rejected o n trial, that same is become the head o f the c or ner.' For this it i s not mine to grant, but God's, that the demon should b e strong enou gh to lift up so great a stone and d epo sit it i n the place I wished.\" 124 . And Ephipp as led the demon of the Red Sea with the column. And they bo th too k the column and raised it aloft from the ea rth. And I outwitted these two spirits, so that they could not shake the e ntire ea rth in a moment of time. And then I sealed round with my [44 ] ring on this s ide a nd that, and said: \"Watch.\" And the spirits have remained upholdin g it until t his day, for proo f of the wisdom vouchsafed to me. And there the pillar was hanging of enormou s s ize, in mid air, suppo rted b y the winds. And thus the spirits app eared underneath, like a ir, suppo rting it. And if one loo ks fixedly, the pillar is a littl e ob lique, being suppo rted b y the spirits; and it is s o to d ay. 125 . And I Solomon questioned the other spirit which came up with the pillar from the depth of the Red Sea. And I said to him: \"Who art thou, and what calls thee? And what is thy bu sin ess? For I hear many things abo ut thee.'' And the demon answered: \"I, O K ing Solomon, am called Abezithibod . I am a descendant of the a rchangel. Once a s I sat in the first heaven, of which the name is Ameleouth -- I then am a fierce spirit and winged, and with a single wing, plotting against every spirit under heaven. I was present when Moses went in before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and I hardened his heart. I am he who m Iannes and"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Iambres invoked homing [1] with Moses in Egypt. I am he who foug ht against Mos es [2] with wonders with signs.\" [1. oíkoyxúmenoi in the MS., a vox n ihili. If we had the a po cryph of Iannes and Iambres we might understand the reference. 2. 2 Tim. iii. 8.] 126 . I said therefore to him: \"How wast thou found in the Red Sea? \" And he a nsw ered: \"In the exod us of the son s of Israel I hardened the heart of Pharaoh. And I excited his heart and that of his ministers. And I caused them to p ursue a fter the c hildren of Israel. And Pharaoh followed with (me) and all t he Egyptians. Then I was presen t there, and we followed together. And we all came up upo n the Red Sea. And it came to pass when the c hildren of Israel had crossed o ver, the water returned and hid all the host of the Egyptians and all t heir might. And I remained in the sea, being k ept un der this pillar. But when Ephipp as came, being sent by thee, shut up in the vessel of a flask, he fetched me up to thee.\" 127 . I, therefore, Solomon, having h eard this, glorified God and adjured the demon s not to disob ey me, but to remain suppo rting the pi llar. And they bo th sware, saying: \"The Lord thy God liveth, we will not let go this pillar until t he world's end. But on whatever day this s tone fall, then shall be the end o f the world [1].\" [1. This legend o f the heavy cornerstone a nd o f the spirits su ppo rting a c olumn in the Temple reapp ears in the Georgian Acts of Nou na in the fourth century. There it is a huge wood en column that is lifted by spirit - agency, when the king and workmen h ad failed to move it into p lace . The spirits s uppo rt it i n the a ir b efore letting it sink into its place . These Acts will shortly app ear in an English translation by Miss Wardrop in the forthcoming nu mber of the Studie Biblica, Clarendo n Press, 189 8.] 128 . And I Solomon g lorified God , and adorned the Temple of the Lord wit h all fair - seeming. And I was glad in spirit in my k ingdom, and there was peace in my days. And I too k wives of my own from every land, who were nu mberless. And I marched against the Jebu saea ns, and there I saw Jebusaean, daughter of a man: and fell violen tly in love with h er, and d esired to take her to wife a lon g with my other wives. And I said to their priests: \"Give me the Son manites (i.e. Shunamm ite) to wife [1].\" But the priests of Moloch said to me: \"If thou lovest this maiden, go in and worship ou r g od s, the great god Raphan and the god called Moloch.\" I therefore was in fear of the glory of God , and d id not follow to worship. And I said to them: \"I will not worship a strange god . What is this propo sal, that ye c ompel me to do so much?\" But they said: \". . . . . [2] by our fathers.\" [1. Song of Sol. vi. 12 . 2. utheìs (sic) stands in the MS.; perhaps taîs theaîs should b e read.] 129 . And when I answered that I would o n n o acc ount worship strange god s, they told the maiden n ot to sleep with me until I complied and sacrificed to the god s. I then was moved, but crafty Eros brought and laid b y her for me five grasshopp ers, saying: \"Take these grasshopp ers, and crush them tog ether in the name of the god Moloch; and then will I sleep with you.\" And this I ac tually did. And at once the Spirit of God d eparted from me, and I beca me weak as well as foo lish in my words. And after that I was ob liged by her to b uild a temple of ido ls to Baal [1], and to Rapha, and to Moloch, and to the other idols. [1. Fem. So Rom. xi. 4.] 130 . I then, wretch that I am, followed her advice, and the glory of God q uite departed from me; and my spirit was darkened, and I became the spo rt of ido ls and d emons. Wherefore I wrote out this Testament, that ye who get po ssession of it may pit y, and attend to the last things [1], and not to the first. So that ye may find grace for ever and ever. Amen. [1. Cp. Rev. ii. 19 .] "}]
