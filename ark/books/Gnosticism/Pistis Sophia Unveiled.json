It came to pass, when Jesus had risen from the dead, that he passed eleven years discoursing with his disciples, and instructing them only up to the regions of the First Commandment and up to the regions of the First Mystery, that within the Veil, within the First Commandment, which is the four and twentieth mystery without and below - those (four and twenty) which are in the second space of the First Mystery which is before all mysterie s, the Father in the form of a dove. “Joyful in hope, suffering in tribulation, be thou constant in thy prayer.” The kings of sexual fire work with patience in the Great Work. The Intimate Christ instructs the mind and the heart. The First Commandment is: To Love God above all things, and thy neighbor as thyself. The First Mystery is Kether, the Ancient of Days. You know this. When the devotee comprehends the First Commandment, he then easily understands the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery. The Four - and - Twentie th Mystery is hidden within the Loom of God. “My loom is weaving net after net, a cloth for my honor and cloths to honor” The Ancient of Days is always hidden within his own Loom, within his own creation. To understand the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery is not possible without previously comprehending the Sixth Mystery. “Thou art giving me labor, O Lord, and fortitude with it.” The Sixth Mystery explains with complete clarity the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery. The Spirit is strong, but the flesh is weak. Do not fa ll into temptation. The soul, sex, temptation, downfall and regeneration are found hidden within the Sixth Mystery. The Ancient of Days, the Father who is in secret, is found in the First Space. Nature, which is explainable only with the Sixth Mystery, is found within the Second Space. What The First Mystery Surroundeth And Jesus said to his disciples: “I am come forth out of that First Mystery, which is the last mystery, that is the four and twentieth mystery.” And his disciples have not known nor under stood that anything existeth within that mystery; but they thought of that mystery, that it is the head of the universe and the head of all existence; and they thought it is the completion of all completions, because Jesus had said to them concerning that mystery, that it surroundeth the First Commandment and the five Impressions and the great Light and the five Helpers and the whole Treasury of the Light.” The inner Jesus comes forth out of the First Mystery. Considering that the Son is one with the Fathe r, and the Father is one with the Son, whosoever has seen the Son, has seen the Father."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 6 The First Mystery is the Mystery of the Father, and this is why it is also the Last Mystery. The Ancient of Centuries is the First and the Last of the Mysteries. The Fo ur - and - Twentieth Mystery, which is explainable by the Sixth Mystery, hides within its womb the First Mystery. The First Mystery, which is explainable by the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery, and which is synthesized in the Sixth Mystery, is the very head of the Universe. The First Mystery, which is also the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery, enfolds the First Commandment, although, the Commandments of the Law of God are twenty - two. The First Commandment also surrounds the five Impressions of the great Light, and the fiv e Helpers, and the whole Treasury of the Light. “I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee, and my heart feeleth thee.” Even though the First Commandment, the five Impressions of the Great Light, the five Helpers, and the entire Treasury of the Light are under the Law of the Scale, they are contained within the First Mystery in their final synthesis. The five Impressions of the Great Light are found represented in the esoteric Pentagram. The Gnostic Pentagram is the human f igure with four limbs, and one unique apex, which is the head. The sign of the Pentagram is also called the sign of the Microcosm. It represents what the Cabbalist Rabbis of the book Zohar call the Microprosopos. When the superior point of the Pentagram is aiming upwards towards the air, it represents the Savior of the world. When the two inferior points of the Pentagram are aiming upwards towards the air, it represents the male goat of the Witches’ Sabbath. A human figure with the head aiming downwards obv iously represents a demon, that is to say, an intellectual subversion, disorder, or madness. The Pentagram, which in the Gnostic schools is known as the Flaming Star, is the sign of magic omnipotence. The five Impressions of the Great Light, and the five H elpers, are contained within the Flaming Star. The five Helpers are the five Genii: Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Michael, and Samael. The entire Treasury of the Light is contained within the Pentagram, and this allegorizes the human being. The comprehension of the magic Pentagram is the key of the two Spaces. The sign of the Pentagram must be composed of the seven metals, or at least traced in pure Gold upon white virgin marble. The seven metals are as follows: Silver, Mercury, Copper, Gold, Iron, Tin and Lead. The Pentagram, with its superior ray aiming upwards, forces the columns of demons to scatter. The Pentagram, with the two inferior rays aiming upwards, attracts the tenebrous ones. When the Pentagram is traced with carbon on the floor of the threshold (en trance) of the room, with its two inferior rays aiming towards the outside of the room, it does not permit the entering of the tenebrous ones. The Pentagram must be consecrated with the four elements, while reciting the exorcisms of fire, air, water and ea rth. Five breaths must be blown upon the magic Pentagram figure."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 7 The Flaming Star must be sprinkled five times with ritual water. The figure of the Pentagram must be dried with the smoke of five perfumes: Frankincense, Myrrh, Moe, Sulphur, and Camphor. Aft erwards, the Pentagram is placed on the floor, alternating successively to the North, South, East and West. The name of Aleph and the sacred name of Thau must be uttered, united in the Kabalistic name of Azoth. While blowing the five breaths upon the Flami ng Star, the five magic Helpers Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Michael, and Samael, must be invoked. Do not forget that the Golden Fleece is the Treasury of the Light. Unquestionably, the Golden Fleece is contained in the First Mystery. No Adept can take possess ion of the Golden Fleece, if he has not previously comprehended the First Conmiandment and the First Mystery. The First Mystery is found contained within the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery, which is the Loom upon which our own fate is woven and unwoven. The Lo om of God, the Great Work, functions only with the Sixth Mystery. The Sixth Mystery is the Lover, the mystery of Love. The transcendental sexual electricity is that marvelous force which originates all motion in the Loom of God. Those who never transmute t he sacred sperm into transcendental sexual electricity leave the Loom of God in suspense. Those who leave the Loom of God in suspense are not working in the Great Work. It is necessary to worship Iod - Heve. Nevertheless, if the worshipper does not continue his work in the Great Work, he becomes stagnant. When one does not possess a Hermetic Glass, then one must attain it in order to work in the Great Work. Often moral codes, prejudgments, and fears constitute a great obstacle to the acquisition of a Hermetic Glass. A damaged or destroyed Hermetic Glass does not serve the Alchemist for his work in the Great Work. The Hermetic Glass is the feminine Yoni; you know this. The key of all power is found in the wise connection of the generator Lingam with the feminin e Yoni. Those who spill the Mercury do not obtain the generation of the transcendental sexual electricity. Thus, they fail in the Great Work. Spilling the Hermetic Glass is equivalent to paralyzing all the activities of the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery. The cowards that are influenced by prejudgments and absurd fears, never obtain a Hermetic Glass. Thus, they lamentably fail. Those who for absurd considerations and false moral postulates adhere themselves to a destroyed or damaged Hermetic Glass, and do not dare to take a new one, leave the Great Work paralyzed. Thus, they lamentably fail. The Treasury is for courageous workers. If the Gods do not want their physical body to degenerate and die, then they must feed themselves with the nectar of immortality."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 8 Th e nectar of immortality is contained within the Holy Grail. The Holy Grail is the feminine sexual Yoni. The Regions of the Great Invisible And moreover Jesus had not told his disciples the total expansion of all the regions of the great Invisible and of the three triple - powers and of the four and twenty invisibles, and all their regions and their aeons and their orders, how they are extended those which are the emanations of the great Invisible and their ungenerated and their self generated and their gene rated and their light givers and their unpaired and their rulers and their authorities and their lords and their archangels and their angels and their decans and their servitors and all the houses of their spheres and all the orders of every one of them. The outcome of the total expansion of all the regions of the Great Invisible, in the Dawn of any Cosmic Creation, becomes extraordinary. The Adept must know all of the supra - sensible Regions of Nature and the Cosmos, and the way in which they are expanded in the Dawn of Creation. The Aeons and their sacred Orders, which are the emanations of the Unknowable and Unmanifested Divinity, dwell in those regions. The thirty pleromatic Aeons shine when emerging in successive and orderly emanations, and in pairs, fr om the Forefather. The thirty Aeons emerge in the Dawn of Creation. The Triple - Powers, the Law of Three, the three Primary Forces of Nature and the Cosmos are indispensable in order to create and create anew. The three Forces are: Holy Affirmation, Holy Ne gation, and Holy Conciliation; Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; positive force, negative force and neutral force. When these three Forces flow in different directions, creation cannot be achieved. In order for a new creation to emerge, these three Primary For ces must reunite at a given point. The Triple - Powers and the Four - and - Twenty Invisibles are present in the Dawn of any Cosmic Creation. Positive, negative and neutral forces, and intensive work in the Great Work, form a unique whole. Thus, the Four - and - Twe nty Elders work intensely in the Zodiac, within which our Solar System is palpitating. “From the effulgence of light - the Ray of the Ever - Darkness - sprung in space the reawakened energies on the Dawn of the Great Day. The One from the Egg, the Six and th e Five, then the Three, the One, the Four, the One, the Five, the Twice Seven, the Sum Total. And these are the Essences, the Flames, the Elements, the Divine Builders, the Numbers, those who have not a body and those who have a body, the Divine Man, the S um Total. “And from the Divine Man emanated the Forms, the Sparks, the Sacred Animals, and the Messengers of the Sacred Powers within the Holy Four.” This is how it always happens in the Dawn of every Cosmic Creation. Those who are ‘ungenerated’ by themsel ves, which means, those who still have not reached the Second Birth, also emanate from the Great Invisible."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 9 The ‘self - generated’, those who have worked in the mysteries of sex and who have reached the Second Birth, emanate from the Great Invisible. The dis ciples of the ‘self - generated’ also emanate generated from the Great Invisible. The disciples of those generated by means of their own Self, and the Light Givers, and their Unpaired, and their Rulers, and their Authorities, and their Lords, and their Archa ngels, and their Angels, and their Decans, and their Liturgists, and all the houses of their respective Spheres, and all the Esoteric Orders of each one of them, emanate from the Great Invisible. The Treasury of the Light And Jesus hail not told his disc iples to total expansion of the emanations of the Treasury, nor their orders, how they are extended; nor had he told them their saviors, according to the order of every one, how they are; nor had he told them what guard is at every (gate) of the Treasury o f the Light; nor had he told them the region of the Twin - savior, who is the Child of the Child; nor had he told them the regions of the three Amens, in what regions they are expanded; nor had he told them into what regions the five Trees are expanded; nor as to the seven Amens, that is the seven Voices, what is their region, how they are expanded. The Treasury is the Philosophical Stone, the resurrected King within each one of us. Emanations, Mystic Orders that are extended, Saviors, etc., emerge from the Treasury. There is always a Guard at every gate of each Temple. There is always a Guard at every gate of the Treasury of the Light. Only the resurrected Master possesses the Treasury of the Light. The Twin Savior is the Son of Man. The Twin Savior is Tiphe reth, the Causal Man, within whom the Logos, the Christ is manifested. The Twin Savior is certainly the Child of the Child. The regions of the three Amens are symbolized by the triangle of the three Supremes, which are found separated from the rest of the Universe, by that abyss which the intellectual humanoid can never pass through. The Ancient of Days is the first activity of manifestation and movement, which is a state of pure becoming. The Christ, the Logos, is the Second Primordial, which is gleaming i n the Zodiacal Belt. The Serpent that bites its tail with its mouth, which is the Third Primordial, emerges from the Logos. The three Amens are the three Primordial Forces from Nature and the Cosmos. The three Primordial Forces are: Holy Affirmation, Holy Negation, and Holy Conciliation. Three Witnesses in Heaven exist: The Father, the Logos, and the Holy Spirit. Three Witnesses on Earth exist: The Breath, the Blood, and the Water. The five Trees are the Prodigies, the Bewitchments, the Jinns, the most hidd en Powers, the Law, the Karma, the Orders of the Lords of the Law The seven Amens are the seven Weors, the seven Spirits before the Throne of the Lamb, the seven Planetary Spirits, and the seven Regions"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 10 The seven Voices are the seven Spirits before the Thr one of the Lamb the seven Genii are: Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Michael, Samael, Zachariel, and Orifiel. The Light World And Jesus had not told his disciples of what type are the five Helpers, nor into what region they are brought; nor had he told them how the great Light hath expanded itself nor into what region it hath been brought; nor had he told them of the five impressions, nor as to the First Commandment, into what region they have been brought. But he had discoursed with them generally, teaching tha t they exist, but he had not told them their expansion and the order of their regions, how they are. For this cause they have not known that there were also other regions within that mystery. And he had not told his disciples: “I have gone forth out of suc h and such regions until I entered into that mystery, and until I went forth out of it”; but, in teaching them, he said to thou “I am come forth from that mystery. “For this cause then they thought of that mystery, that it is the completion of completions, and that it is the head of the universe and that it is the total Fullness. For Jesus had said to his disciples: “That mystery surroundeth that universe of which I have spoken unto you from the day when I met with you even unto this day. “For this cause th en the disciples thought there is nothing within that mystery. The five Helpers are part of the seven Spirits who stand before the Throne of the Lamb. They are brought into manifestation and later brought into the Absolute. The Light is expanded in the da wn of every creation, and then gathered into the bosom of the Absolute at the end of every creation. The five Impressions are related with the First Commandment. They are brought to the Cosmos when the day of every creation is dawning. The order of their d iverse cosmic regions is explained perfectly in the Tree of Life. Unquestionably, Jesus departed from the First Mystery The First Mystery is the completion of completions, the Head of the Universe, and the total Fullness. CHAPTER 2 Jesus and his disciple s are seated on the Mount of Olives It came to pass then when the disciples were sitting together on the Mount of Olives, speaking of these words and rejoicing in great joy, and exulting exceedingly and saying one to another: “Blessed are we before all me n who are on the earth, because the Saviors hath revealed this unto us, and we have received the Fullness and total completion”, -- they said this to one another, while Jesus sat a little removed from them "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 11 A great light - power descendeth on Jesus And it came to pass then, on the fifteenth day of the moon in the month Tybi, which is the day on which the moon is full, on that day then, when the sun had come forth in his going, that there came forth behind him a great light - power shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure to the light conjoined with it. For it came out of the Light of lights, and it came out of the last mystery, which is the four and twentieth mystery, from within without, -- those which are in the orders of the second space of the First Mystery. And that light - power came down over Jesus and surrounded him entirely, while he was seated removed from his disciples and he had shone most exceedingly, arid there was no measure for the light which was on him. The fifteenth day of the Mo on is related with Lucifer. The code of Lucifer is the Arcanum A.Z.F., the sexual force. Unquestionably, the creative power of the Logos is in the creative organs. The splendorous, interior, profound Sun shines on the path of the Initiate. The luminous sex ual force shines most exceedingly in the aura of the Christified Ones. In the final synthesis, the sexual force comes from the Light of lights, which is precisely the Logos. Unquestionably, this Light comes from the Last and First Mystery, which in reality is the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery, the Mystery of the Great Work, the Mystery of the work in the great laboratory of the Universe. All that we have said in these paragraphs is completely understandable to the well qualified Hermetic Artists. Indubitably, the Hermetic Artists belong to the Esoteric Orders, who work in the Second Space of the First Mystery. It is understandable that the Second Space of the First Mystery is the region in which the Hermetic Sages are dwelling. The Ancient of Days dwells within the First Space of the First Mystery, and the First of the Twenty - two Commandments of the Law of God correspond to Him. It surroundeth him entirely And the disc had not seen Jesus because of the great light in which he was, or which was about him; for t heir eyes were darkened because of the great light in which he was. But they saw only the light, which shot forth many light - rays. And the light - rays were not like one another, but the light was of diverse kind, and it was of diverse type, from below upwar ds, one [ray] more excellent than the other, in one great immeasurable glory of light; it stretched from under the earth right up to heaven. And when the disciples saw that light, they fell into great fear and great agitation. Within the inner Jesus Chris t of each one of us, the creative energy shines marvelously. The Logos is the Perfect Multiple Unity. In the world of the Logos, diversity is unity. The Intimate Christ within each one of us is beyond individuality, personality, and the ‘I’. All beings are indeed one in the Lord."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 12 Many rays bud in the ‘Christ - Light’, and from the ‘Christ - Light’. Each Logoic Ray is of a diverse type and distinct class. However, all the Rays in themselves constitute the Logos. Each Ray is the living expression of this or that Adept, or of this or that Christified One. Every Logoic Ray serves as a foundation for this or that Hierophant. The existence of any Adept would be inconceivable, if we exclude from the depth of his Being his corresponding Ray of Light. In the final synthe sis, all the Rays of Light are reduced to one, which stretches itself into one immeasurable Glory of Light, from the Abyss right up to Heaven. CHAPTER 3 Jesus ascendeth into heaven It came to pass then, when that light - power had come down over Jesus, th at it gradually surrounded him entirely. Then Jesus ascended or soared into the height, shining most exceedingly in an immeasurable light. And the disciples gazed after him and none of them spoke, until he had reached unto heaven; but they all kept in deep silence. This then came to pass on the fifteenth day of the moon, on the day on which it is full in the month Tybi. Unquestionably the ascension of the Intimate Christ within each one of us can be attained by means of the Fifteenth Mystery, which is, th e Mystery of Typhoon Baphomet. The Mystery of Baphomet is solved with the Sixth Mystery; you know this. The Hermetic figure of the Baphomet was never absent from the houses of the old Alchemists of the Middle Ages. Lucifer - Baphomet grants us the sexual imp ulse, through which the realization of the Great Work is possible. When we wound Baphomet to death with the Lance of Longinus, we transmute Lead into Gold. The sexual transmutation is fundamental for the Christification. This is the Mystery of Baphomet. In dubitably, if we spill the Hermetic Glass, then metallic transmutation is absolutely impossible. Those who learn how to utilize the sexual impulse intelligently can perform the Great Work. The ascension of the Intimate Christ within us is absolutely possib le when we have comprehended the Fifteenth Mystery, which is the same Mystery of Lucifer - Baphomet. The confusion of the powers and the great earthquake It came to pass then, when Jesus had reached the heaven, after three hours, that all the powers of the heaven fell into agitation, and all were set in motion one against the other, they and all their Aeons and all their regions and all their orders, and the whole earth was agitated and all they who dwell thereon. And all men who are in the world fell into"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 13 agitation, and also the disciples, and all thought: Peradventure the world will be rolled up. And all the powers in the heavens ceased not from their agitation, they and the whole world, and all were moved one against the other, from the third hour of the fifteenth day of the moon of Tybi until the ninth hour of the morrow. And all the angels and their archangels and all the powers of the height, all sang praises to the interiors of the interiors, so that the whole world hear their voices, without their cea sing till the ninth hour of the morrow. The ascension of the Intimate Jesus Christ is a sexual mystery of practical and transcendental Alchemy. The ascension of the Intimate Jesus Christ within us is certainly clear by means of the wise combination of the three Amens. I am emphatically referring to the three fundamental forces of Nature and the Cosmos. The three forces, positive, negative, and neutral, when wisely combined in the flaming Forge of Vulcan, originate the human transformation, the ascension of Christ within us. Stella Mans, the Divine Mother Kundalini, guides the navigator in the boisterous ocean. The victorious Intimate Christ is the Red Christ. The Revolutionary Christ, the Rebel Christ, causes all the powers of good and evil to be agitated. The Red Christ can never be comprehended by the powers of good and evil. All the powers of Heaven are in agitation and set into motion, one against the other, in the presence of the strange procedures of the revolutionary Logos. Indeed, all the Beings, all the Aeons, and all the Regions of the Tree of Life, and their Orders are in agitation in the presence of the Red Christ. The Red Christ is the Christ who worked in the Flaming Forge of Vulcan; the Intimate Saviour Christ; the Christ who became victorious in the hour of temptation; the Christ who ejected all the merchants of the Interior Temple; the Christ who killed the disloyal ones; the Christ dressed with the purple of the Kings. The profound Intimate Christ must fight a tremendous battle against the et ernal enemies of the night, who are within us here and now. These enemies are the disloyal ones, the diverse psychic aggregates that personify our psychological defects. The ascension of Christ within us is a sexual problem. The powers of Light and the pow ers of Darkness are in agitation, and revolve when the resurrection and ascension of the Intimate Christ occurs within us. The Intimate Christ must fight against the powers of good and evil. The Intimate Christ is beyond good and evil. The Intimate Christ grasps the sword of the Cosmic Justice. The powers of good and evil fight between themselves while in the presence of the Christic events. The three Primary Forces of Nature, and of the Cosmos must be crystallized within the human being. The Sacred Absolut e Sun wants to crystallize the three Primary Forces within each one of us The Initiate is developed under the constellation of the Whale."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 14 The inner Self - realization of the Being would be impossible without Lucifer - Baphomet. Lucifer originates the sexual i mpulse within each one of us. If we control the sexual impulse and transmute the sacred sperm, then we rise from degree to degree. All the work of the Great Work is performed in the Ninth Sphere. The Ninth Sphere is sex. Those who spill Hermes’ Glass fail in the Great Work. The Hierarchies of the Fire worship the Interiors of the Interiors. The Interiors of the Interiors are the Beings of the Beings. The Interiors of the Interiors are the Real of the Real. The Seer of the Seer is the Intimate God of the See r; you know this. CHAPTER 4 But the disciples sat together in fear and were in exceedingly great agitation and were afraid because of the great earthquake, which took place, and they wept together, saying, “What will then be? Peradventure the Saviour wil l destroy all regions?” Thus saying, they wept together. All of the great, divine cosmic events are always announced with great earthquakes. Indubitably, great earthquakes also exist within the Superior Worlds. Obviously, the Adepts of Christ prostrate wi th amazement in the presence of these great events. Jesus descendeth again While they then said this and wept together, then, on the ninth hour of the morrow, the heavens opened and they saw Jesus descend, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measu re for his light in which he was. For he shone more [radiantly] than at the hour when he had ascended to the heavens, so that men in the world cannot describe the light which was on him; and it shot forth light - rays in great abundance, and there was no mea sure for its rays, and its light was not alike together, but it was of diverse kind and of diverse type, some [rays] being more excellent than others... and the whole light consisted together. The nature of his glory It was of threefold kind, and the one [kind] was more excellent than the other.... The second, that in the midst was more excellent than the first, which was below, and the third, which was above them all, was more excellent than the two, which were below. And the first glory, which was place d below them all, was like to the light, which had come over Jesus before he had ascended into the heavens, and was like only itself in its light. And the three light - modes were of diverse light - kinds, and they were of diverse type, one being more excelle nt than the other...."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 15 In the ninth hour, the Heavens are opened and the Intimate Christ descends, shining most exceedingly. Those who understand the ninth hour comprehend the twelve hours of Apollonius. The mysteries of Chokmah correspond to the ninth hour . No Adept can experience the ninth hour unless he has previously resurrected. The resurrection of the Intimate Christ within us takes place in the eighth hour. The twelve hours of Apollonius are related with the twelve works of Hercules. The multiple rays of the Logos are of a diverse class and diverse type. Some rays are more excellent than others. However, the Logos is a Perfect Multiple Unity. The light of the Cosmic Christ harmonizes in union. In itself and by itself, the Logos has three aspects. The F ather, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are the three Logoic aspects. The sacred Absolute Sun wants to crystallize the three Primary Forces within us. The Logoic Light is of a threefold kind, and each one is more excellent than the other. One is the light of g lory of the Holy Spirit. Another is the glory of Christ, and another the glory of the Father. The three forms of Logoic Light are of a diverse class and diverse type, one more excellent than the other. However, the entire Logoic Triple Light is one. The Tr iple World of the Logos is the glory of Atziluth. The World of Atziluth is derived from the omnipresent and active Okidanokh. The active Okidanokh is the eternal incessant breath, profoundly unknowable to itself. The active Okidanokh has its root within th e sacred Absolute Sun. CHAPTER 5 Jesus addresseth them And it came to pass then, when the disciples saw this that they feared exceedingly, and were in agitation. Then Jesus, the compassionate and tender hearted, when he saw his disciples, that they were in great agitation, spoke with them, saying: “Take courage. It is I, be not afraid.” The psychological aggregate of fear must be radically eliminated from our nature. The existence of fear is impossible in the Logos. Fear serves as a base for many errors . CHAPTER 6 It came to pass then, when the disciples had heard this word, that they said: “Lord if it be thou, withdraw thy light - glory into thyself that we may be able to stand; otherwise our eyes are darkened, and we are agitated, and the whole world a lso is in agitation because of the great light which is about thee.” "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 16 The Egyptians said: “Osiris is a dark God.” The human beings are not capable of enduring the light - glory. The light of Christ dazzles the dwellers of the Earth. This is why Osiris - Chris t is dark for the human beings. The splendors of Christ bewilder the inhabitants of the Earth. Indeed, people do not comprehend the splendors of Christ. The Consciousness is asleep among the multitudes. As long as the ego, the ‘I’ continues to dwell within us, then, unquestionably, the Consciousness will continue to sleep. The awakening occurs only by annihilating the ego. Only the awakened one can understand the Christic Mysteries. He draweth his light unto himself Then Jesus drew to himself the glory of his light; and when this was done, all the disciples took courage, stepped forward to Jesus, fell down all together, adored him, rejoicing in great joy, and said unto him: “Rabbi whither host thou gone, or what was thy ministry on which thou has gone, or wherefore rather were all these confusions and all the earth - quakings which have taken place?” The Intimate Christ comes time and time again, continuously, each time when it is necessary. The Cosmic Christ is a force, as electricity is a force, or as grav ity is a force, etc. The Cosmic Christ is beyond the personality, individuality, and the ‘I’. The Christ expresses himself through any human being who is perfectly prepared. Nevertheless, great earthquakes and confusions accompany all the Christic events. Christic events are terrifically revolutionary. He promiseth to tell them all things Then Jesus, the compassionate, said unto them “Rejoice and exult from this hour on, for I have gone to the regions out of which I had come forth. From this day on then w ill I discourse with you in openness, from the beginning of the Truth unto its completion; and I will discourse with you face to face without similitude.

It came to pass then, when I had known that the order of the ministry for the sake of which I had come, was completed, and that that mystery had not yet sent me my Vesture, which I had left behind in it, until its time was completed, -- thinking then this, I sat on the Mount of Olives a little removed from you."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 17 Jesus Christ, or the Inner Jesus C hrist within each one of us, always emerges from the world of the Solar Logos in order to be manifested to mankind. In Kabbalah, we would say that the secret Jesus - Christ emerges from Chokmah, and thus, He appears in the Tree of Life. Unquestionably, He de scends from this region in order to penetrate into the womb of His Divine Mother, by the grace and work of the Holy Spirit. Stella Mans is a Virgin before, during, and after childbirth. The Virgin of the Sea gives birth to Her Son within the stable of the world. The stable of Bethlehem is the physical body of the Initiate. The animals of the mind, desire, and evil will are found within the stable of Bethlehem. The Intimate Jesus - Christ must eliminate all the undesirable elements that we carry within our int erior. The Virgin of the Sea is the Daughter of Her Son, and the adorable Wife of the Holy Spirit. She Stella Maris obeys the orders of the Intimate Jesus - Christ and works with Him, eliminating all the undesirable psychic elements from within us. The Intim ate Jesus Christ can teach the Initiates, thanks to the First Mystery, which means, thanks to the Ancient of Days, thanks to the Father of all Lights. The Lord does not hide anything from those who are truly awakened. The Lord teaches the Mystery of the He ight, and of that of the region of Truth to all the Adepts. The Lord secretly instructs us, thanks to the Ineffable, and by the grace and work of the First Mystery of all Mysteries, which is the Mystery of the Father.

No one has uttered it; no one will utter it, except the one who has incarnated Him. The Mount o f the Olives is the Causal World. The Lord descends from the World of the Solar Logos in order to live as a Causal Man. The Lord projects Himself from the Causal World into the Physical World. The Manifested Lord acts within the regions of the Mind. The Ma nifested Lord shines within the Astral Body of the one who has incarnated Him. The Manifested Lord enters the physical body in order to live as a human amongst humans. Every time when it is necessary, the Lord comes to this valley of tears in order to help humanity. The sleeping multitudes never know the Lord. When He comes they always condemn Him. The Intimate Jesus Christ has been crucified many times....

The Divine Mother Kundalini, Stella Mans, works within the Second Space of the First Mystery. We find all the workers of the Great Work within the Second Space of the First Mystery. The workers of the Great Work obey the Father in Heaven as we ll as on the Earth. Now you better comprehend why the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery is the First Mystery. The Divine Mother Kundalini weaves a Vesture for the Adept The whole of this work is performed based on conscious efforts and voluntary sufferings. Those who have lost their sacred Vesture must search for it again. CHAPTER 7 How the Vesture of Light was sent unto him “It came to pass, when the sun rose in the east, thereafter then through the First Mystery, which existed from the beginning, on account o f which the universe hath arisen, out of which also I am myself now come, not in the time before my crucifixion but now, -- it came to pass, through the command of that mystery, that there should be sent me my Light - vesture, which it had given me from the beginning, and which I had left behind in the last mystery, that is the four - and - twentieth mystery from within without, -- those which are in the order of the second space of the First Mystery. That Vesture then I left behind in the last mystery, until the time should be completed to put it on, and I should begin to discourse with the race of men and reveal unto them all from the beginning of the Truth to its completion, and discourse with them from the interiors of the interiors to the exteriors of the ext eriors and from the exteriors of the exteriors to the interiors of the interiors. Rejoice then and exult and rejoice more and more greatly, for to you it is given that I speak first with you from the beginning of the Truth to its completion. The Sun of Mi dnight guides the Initiates in the Superior Worlds The Initiates must know the symbolic movements of the Sun of Midnight Sunrise is equivalent to the birth, to the rising, and to the manifestation of Him, etc Sunset allegorizes the death of something, the descent of something, etc. The Sun, with complete splendor in midday, allegorizes complete plenitude, complete triumph, success of such or such Initiation, etc., etc., etc. We are emphatically referring to the Sun Christ, the Logos, the Astral Sun. The Mys tics see the Astral Sun. He guides them along the path of the razor’s edge. When the clouds of the sky are covering the Astral Sun, this signifies that the animal ego is still very strong within the Initiate. It is necessary; it is urgent to dissolve the a nimal ego, to reduce it into cosmic dust. The Sun - Christ, ascending through the First Mystery, signifies action of the Lord by the will of the Father. The same Universe in which we live, moves, and has our Being in, emerged and came into existence when the Sun ascended through the First Mystery. It was by the will of the Ancient of Days that the Sun ascended through the First Mystery."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 19 The Intimate Christ comes to manifestation not in the time before the hour of His crucifixion, but now. It is here and now t hat the Lord must be crucified. The Lord is crucified within us. The Lord must live the entire Cosmic Drama within ourselves, just as it is written within the Four Gospels, here and now. Nevertheless, it is written that we must previously incarnate Him, yo u know this. However, it is necessary to make the following warning: “Take heed that no man shall deceive you. “For many shall come in my name, saying I am the Christ; and shall deceive many:” (Read Matthew 23: 4 - 5, New Testament) The Venustic Initiatio n is frightfully difficult. The Intimate Christ is incarnated in the Venustic Initiation. It is very rare to find someone who has succeeded in incarnating Him. Nevertheless, there are some sincerely mistaken ones who think the best of themselves. They say, “I have incarnated Him, I am the Christ.” Such people are cheating themselves, as well as others. “Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ, or there; believe it not.” “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” “Behold, I have told you before.” “Wherefore, if they shall say unto you, Behold, He is in the desert go not forth: Behold, He is in the secret chambers; believe it not.” “For as the lightning comet out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.” (Read Matthew: 24: 23 - 27) The Vesture of Light of the Intimate Christ was originally granted to Him. Nevertheles s, it must be elaborately woven upon the Loom of God, in the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery of the Great Work. The Vesture of Light of the Intimate Christ, a symbol of all the powers, is in the Father’s power. The Father is the First and the Last of the Myster ies. The Intimate Christ, when incarnated in a simple and humble human being, will use his sacred Vesture in the Mystery. Profane people will never know the Vesture of Light. The Intimate Christ is covered by the humble personality of someone. People can n ever recognize the incarnated Christ. The Intimate Christ is the Instructor of the world. The incarnated Instructor of the world must discourse with the human race, and reveal to them the beginning of the Truth until its completion. The Adept who has incar nated Him will know how to love Him within himself, and he will never say, “I am the Christ.” The Master who has incarnated Him will worship the Lord and will serve as an instrument for Him."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 20 The incarnated Lord will discourse with the human beings from the interiors of the interiors to the exteriors of the exteriors, and from the exteriors of the exteriors to the interiors of the interiors. All of this signifies that the Lord can help the Being of the Being and the human personality. The incarnated Instruct or of the world can instruct not only the human persons, but also the Beings of those persons, and finally, the Being of the Being. To help the exteriors of the exteriors signifies complete help in all the order of things. To help the interior of the inter ior signifies complete instruction to the Being of the Being. The Incarnated Intimate Christ not only helps, but moreover He helps to help. Only the Adepts of Perfection have incarnated Him. Nevertheless, I tell you, be vigilant, because in these times of the end, there are many who presume that they are Adepts of Perfection. Beware of false prophets. Of the souls of the disciples and their incarnation “For this cause have I chosen you verily from the beginning through the First Mystery. Rejoice then and exult, for when I set out for the world, I brought from the beginning with me twelve powers, as I have told you from the beginning, which I have taken from the twelve saviours of the Treasury of the Light, according to the command of the First Mystery. The se then I cast into the womb of your mothers, when I came into the world, that is those, which are in your bodies today. For these powers have been given unto you before the whole world, because ye are they who will save the whole world, and that ye may be able to endure the threat of the rulers of the world and the pains of the world and its dangers and all its persecutions, which the rulers of the height will bring upon you. For many times have I said unto you that I have brought the power in you out of t he twelve saviours who are in the Treasury of the Light. For which cause I have said unto you indeed from the beginning that ye are not of the world. I also am not of it. For all men who are in the world have gotten their souls out of [the power of] the ru lers of the Aeons. But the power, which is in you, is from me; your souls belong to the height. I have brought twelve powers of the twelve saviours of the Treasury of the Light, taking them out of the portion of my power, which I did first receive. And whe n I had set forth for the world, I came into the midst of the rulers of the sphere and had the form of Gabriel the angel of the Aeons: and the rulers of the Aeons did not know me, but they thought that I was the angel Gabriel. The Twelve Apostles. The Twe lve Powers are within us, here and now. The Twelve Apostles are twelve autonomous parts of our Being. The Twelve Powers, the Twelve, are twelve self - conscious parts, and even independent parts of our own Being. The Twelve Powers, which are the Twelve Apost les of the Inner Christ, are wisely related with the twelve faculties of the human being. However, we must make a clear differentiation between the Twelve Powers and the twelve faculties."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 21 Unquestionably, during the Cosmic Manifestation, the Being within ea ch one of us is the multiplicity within the Unity. All of these autonomous and self - conscious parts of the Being must work in the inner Self - realization. The inner Self - realization of each one of the autonomous and self - conscious parts of the Being is more than impossible, as long as all the undesirable elements that we carry within our interior are not disintegrated. The Twelve Powers are only twelve parts of the many autonomous and self - Conscious parts of the Being. Whosoever perfects the highest part of the Being receives for such a motive the degree of Ishmesch. It is not possible to perfect the highest part of the Being without the radical dissolution of the inhuman elements that we carry within our interior. Within the interior of our Being, James is t he blessed Master of the Great Work. Each one of the Twelve has come to the world in order to help humanity. It is possible to crystallize the Soul within ourselves by dissolving the animal ego. We need to dissolve the undesirable psychological elements i n order to crystallize the Soul within ourselves. Only the Father of all the Lights, the Intimate Father within each one of us, can illuminate us with wisdom through James. James is the Mercury within each one of us. The Mercury of the Secret Philosophy is the very foundation of the Great Work. The Intimate Christ and the Twelve Powers reside within us, here and now. Unquestionably, the Twelve Powers are poured by the Intimate Christ into the womb of the Divine Mother. Each one of us has our own Divine Moth er. The Twelve Powers must dwell within our bodies. This is possible only by disintegrating all the undesirable psychic elements that we carry within our interior. The Twelve Apostles, the fundamental parts of the Being, are always slandered and persecuted by the perverse ones. Every illuminated Master knows this. The historical Jesus Christ, and His Twelve Apostles, symbolizes the Intimate. Christ and the Twelve Powers incarnated in every true human being. There exist Twelve Saviors who symbolize the twelv e zodiacal constellations. The Twelve Powers within each human being are related with the Redeemer of such or such constellation. All the Masters have succeeded in engendering their Souls, or better if I say crystallizing them in the human person, thanks t o the teachings of the Twelve Saviors. We must convert ourselves into pure Soul. With patience you will possess your Soul. This is possible based on conscious work and voluntary sufferings. The Souls of the people reside in a superior level of the Being. T he Soul is the conjunction of all the forces, powers, virtues, essences, etc., that crystallize within us when the entire animal ego has been dissolved. Each time that a psychological defect is dissolved, a virtue, a power, etc., crystallizes within our in terior."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 22 The complete dissolution of all the defects implies the integral crystallization of the Soul within ourselves. If the water does not boil at one hundred degrees, that which must be crystallized does not crystallize, and that which must be dissolved is not dissolved. In similar form, we say that it is necessary to pass through great emotional crisis in order to dissolve psychological defects and crystallize the Soul. The Angel Gabriel is the Regent of the Moon and is related with the Lunar Sphere. Je sus, the Intimate Christ, is the divine Sun within us. Of the incarnation of John the Baptizer “It came to pass then, when I had come into the midst of the rulers of the Aeons, that I looked down on the world of mankind, by command of the First Mystery. I found Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptizer, before she had conceived him, and I sowed into her a power which I had received from the little Iao, the Good, who is in the Midst, that he might be able to make proclamation before me and make ready my w ay, and baptize with the water of the forgiveness of sins. That power then is in the body of John.” John the Baptizer is the same Elias, reincarnated. The great IAO is the power from the Logos itself. The little IAO is the power from the human being. The great IAO is the power from the Super - Man. The minor IAO is the power from Man. The Inner John is inside each one of us, here and now. Every Initiate must encounter the part of his Being, which is called John the Baptizer. The encounter with John always ta kes place in the Second Initiation of the Fire. The encounter with John always takes place in Eden. John is the precursor who prepares the path to our Intimate Christ. The historic John the Baptizer allegorizes the Interior John the Baptizer within each on e of us. That John was Elias in a former birth Moreover in place of the soul of the rulers which he was appointed to receive, I found the soul of the prophet Elias in the Aeons of the sphere; and I took him thence, and took his soul and brought it to the Virgin of Light, and she gave it over to her receivers; they brought it to the sphere of the rulers and cast it into the womb of Elizabeth. So the power of the little Iao, who is in the Midst, and the soul of the Prophet Elias, they were bound into the bo dy of John the Baptizer. For this cause then were ye in doubt aforetime, when I said unto you; “John said: I am not the Christ, ” and ye said unto me: ‘It standeth written in the scripture: When the Christ shall come, Elias cometh before him and maketh read y his way.’ But when ye said this unto me, I said unto you ‘Elias verily is come and hath made ready all things, as it standeth written, and they have done unto him as they would.’ And when I knew that ye had not understood that I had discoursed with you c oncerning the soul of Elias which is bound into John the Baptizer, I answered you in the discourse in openness face to face: ‘If ye like to accept John the Baptizer: he is Elias, of whom I have said that he will come.”"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 23 The Rulers of the Gnostic Church are true awakened Initiates. The Spirit of Elias is also an Aeon, which means, a Master of the Great Day. You know this. The Virgin of Light, Stella Mans, the Divine Mother Kundalini of John the Baptizer, is named by the Great Kabir Jesus. The Saviour delivere d the Spirit of Elias to Stella Mans of John and She delivered Him to Her Receivers. They brought him to the sphere of the Rulers of the Light and cast Him into the womb of Elizabeth. In this manner, the little IAO, the Divine Mother of Light, and the Spir it of Elias were bound into the body of John the Baptizer. Elias reincarnated in John the Baptizer. Thus, John is the living reincarnation of Elias. CHAPTER 8 Of his own incarnation through Mary And Jesus continued again in the discourse and said: “It c ame to pass then thereafter, that at the command of the First Mystery I looked down on the world of mankind and found Mary, who is called ‘my mother’ according to the body of matter. I spoke with her in the type of Gabriel, and when she had turned herself to the height towards me, I cast thence into her the first power, which I had received from Barbelo that is the body which I have borne in the height. And instead of the soul I cast into her the power, which I have received from the great Sabaoth, the Good , who is in the region of the Right. More concerning the light - powers in the disciples And the twelve powers of the twelve saviors of the Treasury of Light, which I had received from the twelve ministers of the Midst, I cast into the sphere of the rulers . And the decans of the rulers and their servitors thought that they were souls of the rulers; and the servitors brought them, they bound them into the body of your mothers. And when your time was completed, ye were born in the world without souls of the r ulers in you. An ye have received your portion out of the power which the last Helper hath breathed into the Mixture, that [power] which is blended with all the invisibles and all rulers and all Aeons, -- in a word, which is blended with the world of destru ction which is the Mixture. This [power] which from the beginning I brought out of myself I have cast into the First Commandment, and the First Commandment cast a portion thereof into the great Light, and the great Light cast a portion of that which it had received, into the five Helpers, and the last Helper took a portion of that which it received, and cast it into the Mixture. And [this portion] is in all who are in the Mixture, as I have just said unto you”. The command of the First Mystery is equivalen t to the command of the Father. Mary is always Isis, the Divine Mother, whose veil no mortal has lifted. In Hebrew, the Army of the Voice, the Host, or Creative Hostess of the Elohim, receives the name of Sabaoth. In the Old Testament, the name of Jehovah is applied to the Host of the Cosmocreators or divine Androgynes who created this Universe, rather than the original name Iod - Heve."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 24 Isis - Mary always receives the First Power, the Holy Affirmation. The Intimate Christ transmits such power to the Divine Moth er Kundalini. We must never forget that there exists three Primary Forces: Holy Affirmation, Holy Negation, and Holy Conciliation. The Great Sabaoth, the Good, who is in the Region of the Right, is the Host of the Creator Elohim. The Intimate Christ always transmits the marvelous power of the Great Sabaoth to Stella Maris. We could not, in anyway, deny the existence of the Twelve Saviors or Avatars. Each one of the Twelve Redeemers has within himself the Twelve Powers. Between each Logoic Redeemer and the m anifested world, there exists a corresponding Master, Spirit, who has emanated from the Redeemer in question. Obviously, the emanated Minister is a sunderable part of the Intimate Logoi. The decans of the Rulers, and their servitors, often think the best o f themselves. They mistakenly assume that they are the Rulers of the Light. Such error is due to pride and ambition. Clearly, those mistaken ones are reborn and return to the world. They are brought to this valley of tears by the servitors of the Rulers. T he Princes of the Gnostic Church never ignore the work of the Abyss. Only those who have worked intensely in the Infernal Worlds achieve the state of Princes or Rulers of the Gnostic Church. In reality, to convert oneself into a Ruler of the Light is only possible by working on oneself, in the Dantesque Ninth Circle. Every exaltation is preceded by a terrible humiliation. Those who want to ascend must first of all descend, such is the law. When the sincerely mistaken ones (who believe that they are Rulers, yet they are not) are reborn, rather than receiving the Spirit of the Rulers, they receive the power for the struggle in life. This Martian power is combined with the world of destruction, which is the mixture, or the result of the mixture of Laws and Forc es. The power of the Savior of the world is found in a very superior level, in relation with the powers of the five Helpers. The power of the Redeemer of the world is cast into the First Commandment, which states: “To love thy God above all things, and thy neighbor as thyself.” The First Commandment, which is love, casts a portion of that power into the Great Light. Unquestionably, the Great Light also casts a portion of the love - power into the five Helpers. The fifth Helper, acting with great power, takes a certain quantity of the substance of love in order to cast it into the mixture, into the world. Indubitably, this last portion of the substance of love is bestowed within the Essence. The Essence, the Consciousness, is disgracefully found bottled up with in the psychic aggregates, the living interior representations of our defects of a psychological type. The Essence is liberated and love shines by the annihilation of the psychological aggregates.

Jesus continued again in the discourse with his disciples [and said]: “Rejoice and exult and add joy to your joy, for the times are completed for me to put on my Vesture, which hath be en prepared for me from the beginning, which I left behind in the last mystery until the time of its completion. Now the time of its completion is the time when I shall be commanded through the First Mystery to discourse with you from the beginning of the Truth to the completion thereof and from the interiors of the interiors [the exteriors of the exteriors]. For the world will be saved through you. Rejoice then and exult, for ye are blessed before all men who are on the earth it is ye who will save the who le world” The Intimate Christ uses His Vesture, the sacred purple, when he has performed the Great Work successfully. We must never forget that the Last Mystery is the First Mystery. The Father has prepared the purple of the Kings for the Son. In the hour of completion, the Son is dressed with the sacred Vesture. The hour of completion of the Great Work within ourselves, here and now, is terribly divine. The Twelve Powers, the Twelve Apostles, are, I repeat, twelve autonomous and self - conscious parts of ou r own Being. The Twelve Apostles, under the direction of the Intimate Christ, are expressing themselves through the Initiate when he is working for the suffering humanity. The Twelve are twelve aspects of the Being, within the individual Unity. CHAPTER 9 It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished saying these words to his disciples, that he continued again in the discourse, and said unto them; “Lo, I have then put on my Vesture, and all authority hath been given me through the First Mystery. Yet a litt le white and I will tell you the mystery of the universe and the fullness of the universe; and I will hide nothing from you from this hour on, but in fullness will I perfect you in all fullness and in all perfection and in all mysteries, which are the perf ection of all perfections and the fullness of all fulnesses and the gnosis of all gnosis, -- those which are in my Vesture. I will tell you all mysteries from the exteriors of the exteriors to the interiors of the interiors. But hearken that I may tell you all things, which have befallen me. The Intimate Christ is covered with the divine purple, which is used by those who have accomplished the Great Work. Christ said: “Lo, I have then put on my Vesture, and all authority bath been given me through the First Mystery.” It is well known to us that the First Mystery is the Father who is in secret. There are as many Fathers in Heaven as there are creatures on Earth. Each one of us has his own Father.

The Intimate Chr ist, within the interior profundity of the Being, can and must perfect the Twelve, the Seven, the Twenty - four, and the Four, etc., etc., etc. Moreover, it is necessary to repeat that the Being is multiple during his manifestation. The Intimate Christ perfe cts the different autonomous and self - conscious parts of our Being, by dissolving the undesirable elements that we carry within our interior. The Being is the Being, and the reason for the Being to be, is to be the Being Himself. We must not confuse the Be ing with the ‘I’. The ‘I is composed of thousands of psychic aggregates that personify our psychological defects. The Intimate Christ in ourselves and within ourselves must dissolve all of the undesirable elements that we carry within our interior, The Int imate Christ comes to instruct us in secret.

CHAPTER 10 The mystery of the five words on the vesture It came to pass then, when the sun ha d risen in the east, that a great light - power came down, in which was my Vesture, which I had left behind in the four - and - twentieth mystery, as I have said unto you. And I found a mystery in My Vesture, written in five words of those from the height: ZAMA ZAMA OZZA RACHMA OZAI whose solution is this: Obviously, the Vesture of the Adorable One is found in the Four - and Twentieth Mystery. The Divine Mother Kundalini weaves the Lord’s Vesture on the Loom of God. The Loom of God is the Four - and - Twentieth Myste ry. These five magic words are written on the Lord’s Vesture: ZAMA ZAMA OZZA RACHAMA OZAI. These are words of the language of the Light. The solution thereof “O Mystery, which is without in the world, for whose sake the universe hath arisen, -- this is th e total outgoing and the total ascent, which hath emanated all emanations and all that is therein and for whose sake all mysteries and all their regions have arisen, -- come hither unto us, for we are thy fellow - members.

Lo, time is completed; put it on [thee] The Ancient of Days is the First and he Last of the Mysteries within our own Being. The Ancient of Days is the cause of the great universal arising. The Ancient of Ancient s combines causes in order to make the Universe arise. All of the Mysteries have arisen by the will of the Father who is in secret. The total outgoing of the primary universal forces and the ascension or re - entering of the three original forces are due to the First Mystery, which is also the Last of the Mysteries. All the cosmic emanations and all that is therein, and for whose sake all the Mysteries have arisen, have emanated from these ascending and descending emanations and from the re - absorption of the three Primary Forces. All that takes place within the Universe also takes place within the real human being. The three Primary Forces come from the Great Breath. You know this. The three Primary Forces in themselves and by themselves are sunder able parts of the Great Breath, which is profoundly unknowable to itself. The Great Breath is rooted in the Sacred Absolute Sun. You know this. The three Primary Forces emanate from the Great Breath, and are reabsorbed in the Great Breath. The Great Breath emanates f rom the Sacred Absolute Sun, and at the end of the Great Day it is reabsorbed in the Sacred Absolute Sun. It is not possible to create unless the Great Breath has previously unfolded into its three forces: Positive, negative and neutral. When these three o riginal forces, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, meet or coincide at a given point, a creation is performed. The Holy Seven is that which corresponds to the organization of such creation. The Holy Three creates and re - creates, but creation cannot be organized without the Holy Seven. Any Cosmos can exist thanks to the very intimate collaboration of the Three and the Seven. The Ancient of Days is the First Mystery, which existed within the Ineffable from the beginning, before it came forth. Come to u s and within us, Divine Ancient, for we are part of Thyself. We are really the result of the final results of the multiple, sunderable divisions of the Ancient of Days. The Father and the Son are one; the Father is one with the Son and the Son is one with the Father. Whosoever has seen the Son has seen the Father. We must search for the Ancient of Days within the last limits of ourselves. He is the Last Mystery from within, and He; Himself is the superior part of our Being. When we refer to the last limit, we refer to it in the sense of cosmic manifestation. The Being is unlimited beyond cosmic manifestation.

For this cause, therefore, hath the First Mystery sent thee through us the mystery of all his glory, consisting of two vestures.” The Father is the First Mystery with all His glory. The Father, the So n, and the Holy Spirit constitute the Trinity within the Unity of life. If the Son and the Holy Spirit are clothed, each one with his holy Vesture, unquestionably, the Ancient of Days is also clothed with those two Vestures. The three Vestures, or the thre e glorious bodies, gleam in the Infinite. The Father is prior to all that which is, has been, and will be. He is the Existence of Existences, the Primordial Point, the White Head, the Ancient of Days, the Vast Countenance, Lux Occulta, Lux Interna and the Point within the Circle. The Ancient of Centuries is the One, who existed before there was any reflection of Himself to serve Him for an image in Consciousness and set up polarity, The Ancient of Days is concealed Intelligence. The Ancient of Days shines i n the glory of Atziluth. The first vesture “In the first is the whole glory of all the names of all mysteries and all emanations of the orders of the spaces of the Ineffable” The emanations of all Orders of all the Spaces of the Ineffable shine on the V esture of the Ancient of Days. The names of all Mysteries shine gloriously on the Vesture of the Ancient of Centuries. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 29 The second vesture “And in the second vesture is the whole glory of the name of all mysteries and all emanations which are in the orde rs of the two spaces of the First Mystery.” The Name of all lesser and Major Mysteries and all radiant emanations, which are in the Orders of the two Spaces of the First Mystery, shine in the Vesture of Christ. The third vesture “And in this [third] ves ture, which we have just sent thee, is the glory of the name of the mystery of the Revealer, which is the First Commandment, and of the mystery of the five Impressions, and of the mystery of the great Envoy of the Ineffable, who is the great Light, and of the mystery of the five Leaders, who are the five Helpers. There is further in this vesture the glory of the name of the mystery of all orders of the emanations of the Treasury of the Light and of their saviors, and [the mystery] of the orders of the order s, which are the seven Amens and the seven Voices and the five Trees and the three Amens and the Twin - Savior, that is the Child of the Child, and of the mystery of the nine guards of the three gates of the Treasury of the Light. There is further therein th e whole glory of the name [all those] which are in the Right and of all those which are in the Midst.

The Revealer is always the Holy Spirit. The gentle human, illuminated and perfect, is the concrete result of the crystallization of the Holy Spirit within us. The Wife of the Holy Spirit is the Divine Mother Kundalini, Marah, the Great Sea, our Particul ar Cosmic Mother. Each one of us has his own Mother. The Divine Mother Isis is a sunderable part of the Holy Spirit within us, a variation of our own Being. The Mystery of the Revealer is included in the First Commandment of the Law of God. The divine Spou se and His ineffable Wife constitute the Original Couple. Love God above all things, and thy neighbor as thyself. The Original Couple serves as a foundation for the First Commandment. The Original Couple is the foundation of the Mystery of the Revealer. Th e Arcanum A.Z.F. is the Mystery of the Revealer. The key of the Great Mystery is the connection of the Lingam - Yoni, without the ejaculation of the Ens - Seminis. The Mystery of the five Impressions is the Flaming Star. You know this. The Great Envoy is the I ntimate Christ."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 30 The Intimate Christ comes to the world whenever it is necessary. It is fundamental to incarnate the Christ within ourselves in order to perform the Great Work. The five Leaders are the five Helpers within ourselves, here and now. In the sam e manner, which the five Helpers, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Michael, and Samael, exist in the solar system, there also exists five Helpers inside of the microcosmic human being. They are five autonomous and independent parts of the Being. The inner five Hel pers guide the Initiate under the supreme direction of the Father. The glory of the name of the Occult Mystery of all Orders of the emanations of the Treasury of the Light shines in the Vesture of the Holy Spirit. The Treasury of the Light is the Logos clo thed with To Soma Heliakon, the body of Gold of the Solar Human. Every authentic Christified Initiate possesses the Treasury of the Light within his interior. Emanations, rays, radiations, etc., emerge from the Treasury of the Light. Esoteric Orders and in effable Religions emerge from the Treasury of the Light that is inside of any Adept of Perfection. The glory of the name of every Mystic Order originally emerged from the Treasury of the Light. The Mystery of the Saviors emerges from the Treasury of the Li ght, which is hidden within the profundity of the illuminated Adepts. The Mystery of the Orders of the Orders emerges from the Treasury of the Light, which is hidden within the Being of the Being of every Self - realized Adept. The Orders of the Orders are c onstituted by the seven Amens, the seven Voices, the five Trees and the Twin Saviour, who is the Child of the Child. The nine Guards of the Great Treasury of the Light are hidden within each one of us. The nine Guards of the Great Treasury are nine self - in dependent and self - conscious parts of our own Being. The Ninth Path is pure intelligence. The Ninth Path is Yesod, the very foundation of the Great Work. The Ninth Path is absolutely sexual. The Ninth Path is in the sexual organs. The Ninth Path is guarde d by the Flaming Sword of the Cherubims, the Mighty Ones. Shaddai El Chai is the secret name of the Ninth Path. The Path that conduces the Initiate to the final Liberation is absolutely sexual. Sex is in the Ninth Sphere. It is really the Ninth Sphere. The three gates of the Treasury of the Light have three secret names. Eheieh is the name of the first gate. Yehovah is the divine name of the second gate. Yehovah - Elohim is the sacred name of the third gate. The first gate is in the Father. The second gate is in the Son. The third gate is in the Holy Spirit. Obviously, the Treasury of the Light has three gates. The great Gothic Cathedrals have one central gate and two minor gates on either side. You know this."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 31 The entire glory of all those who are in the Right and of all those who are in the Midst shine in the Vesture of the Holy Spirit. The Great Invisible is the Cosmic Common Eternal Father, the Infinitude that sustains all, the Omnimerciful. Elohim emerges from the Great Invisible. Elohim is the Army of the Voice. Elohim is the Creator - Verb. Elohim is interpreted as a manifested God who emerges from within the womb of Aelohim in order to create and create anew. Elohim is a feminine name with a plural masculine ending. Therefore, Elohim means Gods and Goddesse s. A Religion without Goddesses is found halfway upon the path of Atheism, because Elohim is Gods and Goddesses. The name of the Great Invisible is Aelohim. Let it be known, now arid forever, that Aelohim is the Unknowable and Unmanifested Divinity. The Gr eat Invisible is the Abstract Absolute Space. The Great Invisible is the Unmanifested One. Elohim buds from the Great Invisible. Elohim is both masculine arid feminine. Unquestionably, this is why men and women have the same rights. Together, they can obta in Christification. Man could never go beyond woman, nor could she climb spiritual heights more elevated than man. Those who affirm that women cannot Self - realize are ignorant. Blessed be the Christified women. The Great Invisible is the Forefather of all that has been, is, and will be. The Three Triple Powers emanate from the Great Invisible. The Mystery of the Three Triple Powers is explained in the human being and within the human being. Two Triples emerge from the Thrice - One Logoi, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit within every Being, who is really a human being. The Intimate and his two Twin Souls, the Spiritual Soul who is feminine, and the Human Soul who is masculine, constitute the second Trimurti, which emanates from the Logoi. The Mental, As tral, and Physical bodies constitute the Third Triple that emerges from the Logoi. The vital base or Linga - Sarira is only the superior section of the physical body. Never forget that the physical body is tetra dimensional. The Thirteenth Aeon, which is bey ond the Twelve Gates, is Am, Sat, the Unmanifested One. Knocking on the Thirteenth Gate is equivalent to entering the bosom of the Cosmic Common Eternal Father, whose Hebraic name is Aelohim. Every Initiate must previously integrate himself with Elohim bef ore integrating himself with Aelohim. Each one of us has his own Interior Elohim. The Interior Elohim is the Being of our Being."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 32 The Interior Elohim is our Father - Mother. The Interior Elohim is the ray that emanates from Aelohim. Aelohim is the Onmimercifu l, the Cosmic Common Eternal Father, the Abstract Absolute Space. Every Adept can perform the twelve works of Hercules if he proposes to do so. Rare is he that dares to knock on the Thirteenth Aeon. Knocking on the Thirteenth Gate signifies the submergence within the bosom of the Infinitude that sustains all. Absolute perfection is needed in order not to fall from the bosom of Aelohim. Any longing, as insignificant as it could be for a separate existence or to be someone, is enough to cause one to be self - r eleased from Aelohim and to fall under the reign of the Demiurge Creator. All the Rulers, Archangels, Lords and Angels of the Twelve Regions or Twelve Aeons shine in the sacred Vesture of the Holy Spirit. The Twelve Aeons or Twelve Cosmic Regions mutually penetrate and copenetrate without confusion. The total mystery of the name of all those who are in the Fate shines in the Vesture of the Holy Spirit. Not all the Beings are in the Law of the Fate. Millions of creatures are found trapped within the Law of A ccidents. The names of all those who dwell in the Spheres and in the Firmaments, and in the diverse Regions, shine in the Vesture of the Holy Spirit. The thesis of the various Firmaments is the same as the thesis of the various Infinities. 8 + 8 = 8 Transinfinite Mathematics demonstrates the crude reality of the various Infinities. Beyond our Infinity, which is perceptible with the most powerful telescopes, there exists another Infinity. It is written that much further than the Infinity bey ond, there is yet another Infinity. Only Aelohim knows the total number of Firmaments. The names of all the Ineffable Beings that live in the various Firmaments shine in the sacred Vesture of the Holy Spirit. The names of all those who live in the diverse Regions sparkle in the ineffable Vesture of the Holy Spirit. We must make a clear differentiation between Firmament and Regions. Regions are equivalent to Dimensions. The twelve Aeons are the twelve Regions. The twelve hours of Apollonius are related with the twelve existing Aeons within every Firmament. Each one of the twelve works of Hercules that the Adepts must perform are found to be related to the twelve Aeons. The thirty Aeons that emanated as couples from within the bosom of Aelohim are something di fferent. They are the Cosmocreators or Creator Elohim.

The Multiple Cosmic Spheres and all the suprasensible Regions of the Universe and Universes of the First Commandment glisten in the infinite Space. The Spheres shine from the First Commandment in the First Space. The Father, the Ancient of Days, Mercy of Merc ies, Concealed of the Concealed, is the First Mystery. The Son is clothed at the command of the Father. The Son is clothed with His two Vestures. The Vesture of the Son and the one of the Child of the Child, which is the Christified Causal Body, marvelousl y glisten in the Lord. Aelohim assigns the total mystery of the perfection of the First Mystery, situated in the Ancient of Centuries. Aelohim is the infinitude that sustains all. The glory of the First Mystery is the whole glory. The one, who is integrate d with the Ancient of Days, after some intimate super efforts, could be integrated with Aelohim. CHAPTER 11 Jesus putteth on his vesture “It came to pass then, when I saw the mystery of all these words in the vesture which was sent me, that straightway I clothed myself therewith, and I shone most exceedingly and soared into the height.

Not a single Initiate can pass beyond Sirius. Sirius is the Capital of the Milky Way. Our whole Galaxy splendorously revolves around Sirius. The right to pass beyond Sirius must be earned. Only those who are integrated with the Intimate Christ have earned that right. Opening the gates of the Firmament is equivalent to gaining the right to pass beyond Sirius. The Intimate Christ, integrated with the Adept, gloriously shines most exceedingly w hen passing through the gates of the Firmament. Passing through the gates of the Firmament is equivalent to passing beyond our Galaxy. The gates of the Infinite are opened before the Christified Adept. The Powers of the Firmament are amazed and fall down and adore him “And all the archons and all authorities and all angels therein were thrown all together into agitation because of the great light which was on me. And they gazed at the radiant vesture of light, with which I was clad, and they saw the myste ry, which contains their names, and they feared most exceedingly.

The Mystery that contains the ineffable names shines in the Vesture of the Intimate Christ. The Cosmic Christ, the Intimate Christ, is the Lord of the Universe. The Initiated, devoted and sincere persons sing to the Interiors of the Interiors, but very few see the Intimate Christ. The Intimate Christ loosens the bonds and breaks the chains.

The Christified human, the Blessed One, the Christ - Man, has the keys to the entire Firmament, as does the Emperor of the Cosmos. It is fundamental to work on ourselves in order to reach Christification. It is written: “Give blessings unto the labor of thy hands, and place thy heart into thy thoughts.” The Intimate Jesus Christ passes through the supra sensible world with a suit of sparkling Light and soars from sphere to sphere. All the doors have been exempted to Him. However, the Archons and Guardians of those places, who always worship Him, are frightened by Him. Christ is worshipped in all the house s of the sphere of manifestation. The powers of the first sphere are amazed and fall down and adore him “I entered into the houses of the sphere, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure to the light that was about me.

Every knee is bent in the presence of the Intimate Jesus Christ. The Intimate Jesus Christ loosens the bonds, breaks the chains, and liberates.

The Zodiacal House, or the Temple of the Zodiac, has twelve sanctuaries. Every creature that is reborn is placed under a determined zodiacal sign. When they are reborn, the awakened Initiates penetrate willfully into any of the twelve sanctuaries of the Zodiacal Temple. Every Illuminated One has the complete right to willfully choose their zodiacal sign. The Illuminated One waits inside of the chosen zodiacal sanctuary for the Lords of the Law. They bind him to the body in which he must be reborn. The corresponding symbols shine within each one of the twelve sanctuaries of the Zodiacal Cathedral. Unquestionably, each zodiacal sign has its symbolism. The Intimate Christ is the Great Liberator. The Lord of Perfections can liberate us from the zodiacal tyranny.

Unquestionably, the Fifteenth Arcanum is terrific. Typhoon Baphomet, Lucifer, is the Fifteenth Arcanum. Sexual transmutation is the foundation of the Mystery of Baphomet. Typhoon Baphomet is the reflection of the Solar Logos within our own selves, here and now. Lucifer Baphomet always gives the sexual impulse. If we refrain the sexual impulse in the sexual act, we obtain transmu tation. Lucifer Baphomet gives the great impulse, however, if we thrust the Lance of Willpower into his side, we will defeat him; Defeating temptation is equivalent to climbing on the back of Lucifer. Lucifer is the stairs to ascend. Lucifer is the stairs to descend. 1+5=6, the Lover, Love. Six is the key of the Fifteenth Arcanum. Lucifer will convert us into Archangels, if we perform the Mystery of Baphomet within ourselves. The Brass must be whitened. Burn your books and whiten the Brass. Whiten the devil . Convert him into Lucifer. One whitens the devil when one transmutes the sexual energy and eliminates the ego. People have their Lucifer converted into a devil. When shining Lucifer integrates with the human being, then he converts us into Archangels of L ight. Within the completely Christified Adept, that Light is of 8,700 myriads; you know this. Only those who have worked with Lucifer in the infernos can reach or possess such Light. Lo and Behold the Mystery of Baphomet and Abraxas.

Adamas, the great Tyrant of the Fate, and all the tyrants in all the Aeons, call upon the Adept. This signifies that the Lords of the Law call upon the Adept, time after time, to yield to his accounts. The Adepts, called to yield their accounts, suffer while answering to their debts, which belong to very transcendental stages.

The power then which was in Isaiah, prophesied concerning thee aforetime, saying: ‘From now on ye shall then know not what the Lord Sabaoth will do.’ Because of the light - power which thou didst receive from Sabaoth, the Good, who is in the region of the Right, and which is in thy mat erial body to - day, for this cause then, my Lord Jesus, thou host said unto us: ‘Who hath ears to hear, let him hear,’ in order that thou mightest know whose heart is ardently raised to the kingdom of heaven.” "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 42 At this time, the solar creatures, converte d into lunar creatures, live as vulgar beings over the face of the Earth. The solar creatures (by involutionary processes) transformed themselves into lunar creatures. Therefore, they lost their powers. Those who cry out of the Earth, those who cry out of their belly, the horoscope casters and foretellers from street fairs or businesses, are lunar creatures in their majority. It is written that the ancient Solar Humanity degenerated, became lunar, and became vulgar. Sabaoth will accomplish its own Work. Sab aoth is the Army of the Voice, the Great Word, the Verb. The Solar Gods from the past frightfully devolved. Thus, they became lunar. The Rulers of the Aeons and their Spheres fell, and their Fate was changed since ancient times. The fallen Gods, converted into lunar human beings, know nothing about the occult purpose of Sabaoth. CHAPTER 19 It came to pass then, when Mary had finished saying these words that he said: “Well said, Mary, for thou art blessed before all women on the earth, because thou shall b e the fullness of the fulinesses and the perfection of all perfections.” In the Cathedral of the Soul, there is more happiness for one repented sinner, than for a thousand righteous ones who do not need of repentance. Mary Magdalene gleams, and will gleam terribly divine. Jesus commandeth Mary she further questioneth him on the changing of the spheres Now when Mary had heard the Saviour speak these words, she exulted greatly, and she came before Jesus, fell down before him, adored his feet and said unto him: “My Lord, hearken unto me, that I may question thee on this word, before that thou discoursest with us about the regions whither thou didst go.” Jesus answered and said unto Mary: “Discourse in openness and fear not; all things on which thou questione st, I will reveal unto thee.” Kundry always falls at the feet of Parsifal in order to manifest her love and obedience. The Intimate Jesus - Christ reveals the Mysteries to Magdalene. CHAPTER 20 She said “My Lord, will all the men who know the mystery of t he magic of all the rulers of all the Aeons of the Fate and of those of the spheres in the way in which the angels who transgressed have taught them, if they invoke them in their mysteries, that is in their evil magic, to the hindering of good deeds, -- wil l they accomplish them henceforth from now on or not?” "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 43 The fallen Boddhisattwas of Angels, or human Souls of Angelic Spirits know the Mystery of the Magic of all the Archons of all the Aeons of the Fate.

Jesus explaineth further the conversion of the spheres Jesus answered and said unto Mary: “They will not accomplish them as they accomplishe d them from the beginning, because I have taken away a third of their power; but they will raise a loan from those who know the mysteries of the magic of the thirteenth aeon. And if they invoke the mysteries of the magic of those who are in the thirteenth aeon, they will accomplish them well and surely, because I have not taken away power from that region, according to the command of the First Mystery.” The fallen Boddhisattwas have lost a third of their power. This signifies that in no way do they possess the crystallization of the three Primary Forces of Nature and the Cosmos. Only with the powers of the Thirteenth Aeon is it possible for the fallen Gods to once again become Solar. The Mysteries of the magic of the Thirteenth Aeon lead us to the Buddhist Annihilation. Redemption is obtained by the death of the ego, by omitting its existence. We can and must invoke Isis in the Flaming Forge of Vulcan. Those who invoke the serpent in the Ninth Sphere will be assisted. The Divine Mother Kundalini is reinforce d with sexual power. The Cosmic Mother can reduce any undesirable psychic element to cosmic dust when we invoke Her during the moment of the chemical copulation. If we work in the Ninth Sphere, then all the undesirable psychic aggregates can be disintegrat ed. Those who spill Hermes Glass never disintegrate the animal ego. If the fallen Gods would work in the Ninth Sphere, then they would be redeemed. The Mysteries of the Thirteenth Aeon signify: “Radical death of the ego.” When the Angels fornicate, they fa ll. Then, the ego resurrects. The fallen Angels can rise again if they annihilate the ego. The ego must be annihilated in the Ninth Sphere, sex. You know this. CHAPTER 21 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished saying these words, that Mary continue d again and said: “My Lord, will not then the horoscope - casters and consulters from now on declare unto men what will come to pass for them?” And Jesus answered and said unto Mary: “If the horoscope - casters find the Fate and the sphere turned towards the l eft, according to their first extension, their words will come to pass, and they will say what is to take place.

In like manner also the consulters, if they invoke the names of the archons and chance on them facing the left, will tell [men] with accuracy all things concernin g which they shall ask their decans. On the contrary, if the consulters invoke their names when they face to the right, they will not give ear unto them, because they are facing in another form compared with their former position in which Yew had establish ed them: seeing that other are their names when they are turned to the left and other their names whey they are turned to the right. And if they invoke them whey they are turned to the right, they will not tell them the truth, but they will confound them w ith confusion and threaten them with threatening. Those then who do not know their path, when they are turned to the right, and their triangles and their squares and all their figures, will find nothing true, but will be confounded in great confusion and w ill find themselves in great delusion, because I have now changed the works which they effected aforetime in their squares, when turned to the left, and in their triangles and in their octagons, in which they were busied continuously turned to the left: an d I have made them spend six months forming all their configurations turned to the right, in order that they may be confounded in confusion in their whole range.

Diviners and soothsayers can forecast what will occur to human beings only if the Fate of these persons have not been altered. Fate can be altered when the Logos or Christ wants to do so. Karma is an oriental word, which signifies: Action an d consequence. Karma is a Sanskrit term, which indicates: Laws of cause and effect. Every cause has its effect. A cause does not exist without an effect; neither does an effect exist without a cause. Those who know the Law of Return and Reoccurrence compre hend the Law of Karma. Those who know the Law of Reincarnation know the Law of Karma. The bad actions of former lives must be canceled, here and now. Not only do we pay Karma for the evil that we do, but also for the good that we should do but we do not do . However, Karma can be negotiated. Karma can also be forgiven. Karmaduro is another Sanskrit term, which indicates Karma that can neither be negotiated nor forgiven. There also exists the Law of Katancia, the superior Karma of Gods and Adepts. The Law of Katancia also allows negotiations and forgiveness. The Lion of the Law must be fought with the Scale.

Sex, sexual force is the power of the Holy Spirit. Adultery, fornication and any sexual fault or crime is a sin against the Ho ly Spirit. Therefore, the phrase of Christ is clarified. It states: “If the horoscope - casters find the Fate and the sphere turned towards the left, according to their first extension, their words will come to pass, and they will say what is to take place. But if they chance on the Fate or the sphere turned to the right, they are bound to say nothing true, for I have changed their influences and their squares and their triangles and their octagons.” The horoscope - casters, consulters, prophets and sages can f orecast the Fate and Karma of someone. Yet, they could be right or wrong. It is right when Karma has not been forgiven. The horoscope - caster or consulter is wrong when Karma has been negotiated or forgiven. It is written, “When an inferior law is transcend ed by a superior law, the superior law washes away the inferior law.” The Cosmic Christ has made Karmic negotiations possible for the good of this suffering humanity. CHAPTER 22 Philip questioneth Jesus It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished sayi ng these words, while Philip sat and wrote all the words that Jesus spoke, -- thereafter then it came to pass that Philip came forward, fell down and adored the feet of Jesus, saying: “My Lord and Saviour, grant me authority to discourse before thee and to question thee on this word, before thou discoursest with us concerning the regions whither thou didst go because of thy ministry.” And the compassionate Saviour answered and said unto Philip: “Authority is given thee to bring forward the word which thou w iliest” And Philip answered and said unto Jesus: My Lord, on account of what mystery hast thou changed the binding of the rulers and their Aeons and their Fate and their sphere and all their regions, and made them confounded in confusion on their path and deluded in their course? Hast thou then done this unto them for the salvation of the world or has thou not?” If the Intimate Lord had not made forgiveness and negotiations possible, many who could have been saved would have been sunk. Negotiations and for giveness were made possible for the salvation of the world. The Great Compassionate One loves this entire suffering humanity. CHAPTER 23 Why the path of the Aeons was changed. And Jesus answered and said unto Philip and to all the disciples together: “I have changed their path for the salvation of all souls. Amen, amen, I say unto you if I had not changed their path, a host of souls would have been"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 46 destroyed, and they would have spent a long time, if the archons of the Aeons and the archons of the Fate an d of the sphere and of all their regions and all their heavens and all their Aeons had not been brought to naught; and the souls would have continued a long time here outside, and the completion of the number of perfect souls would have been delayed, which [souls] shall be counted in the Inheritance of the Height through the mysteries and shall be in the Treasury of the Light. For this cause then I have changed their path, that they might be deluded and fall into agitation and yield up the power which is in the matter of their world and which they fashion into souls, in order that those who shall be saved, might be quickly purified and raised on high, they and the whole power, and that those who shall not be saved, might be quickly destroyed. Unquestionably , the Intimate Christ has made forgiveness and negotiations possible in order that those who shall be saved might be quickly purified and raised on high. The Lord has made possible all types of negotiations and forgiveness so that people might define thems elves, and that those who shall not be saved might be quickly destroyed. CHAPTER 24 Mary questioneth him again. It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished saying these words unto his disciples, that Mary, the fair in her discourse and the blessed one , came forward, fell at the feet of Jesus and said: “My Lord, suffer me that I speak before thee, and be not wroth with me, if oft I give thee trouble questioning thee.” The Saviour, full of compassion, answered and said unto Mary: “Speak the word which th ou willest, and I will reveal it to thee in all openness.” Mary answered and said unto Jesus: “My Lord, in what way will the souls have delayed themselves here outside, and in what type will they be quickly purified?” The Souls have delayed themselves her e outside, due to the inhuman elements, which constitute the ego, the ‘I’. Unquestionably, the Essence is found bottled up within multiple, inhuman psychic aggregates. Such aggregates personify our psychological defects: Anger, greed, lust, envy, pride, la ziness, gluttony, etc. In Egypt, such undesirable elements were known as the Red Demons of Seth. Each demon of Seth is an ‘I’ in itself. This is irrefutable and indisputable. As long as the psychic Essence continues to be bottled up within the Red Demons of Seth, the Consciousness will process itself by virtue of its own embottlement. Indubitably, the bottled up Consciousness sleeps profoundly. People live asleep, unconscious. This is how they exist, work, and suffer. Nevertheless, they think that they are awake. Those who annihilate the Red Demons of Seth will liberate their Consciousness. They will radically awaken it."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 47 The annihilation of the psychic aggregates can be made possible only by radically comprehending our errors through meditation and by the e vident self - reflection of the Being. The mind can never annihilate a psychological defect. The mind can hide the psychological defect from itself, justifying it, condemning it, hiding it from the others, and labeling it with distinct names. However, it can never fundamentally alter the defect. If we want to atomically disintegrate the psychic aggregates, which we carry within our interior, then we need a power that is superior to the mind. Fortunately, we have Devi Kundalini inside. Unquestionably, she is S tella Mans, the Virgin of the Sea, the igneous Serpent of our magical powers. Obviously, Stella Mans is a flaming power of our own Being. She is our own Being, but a derivative, Stella Mans is Isis, Isobertha, Mary, Rhea, Cibeles, Tonantzin, Marah, Diana, etc., etc. Our own Goddess Mother within ourselves can reduce any undesirable element of our psyche to cosmic dust, with the condition that it has been previously comprehended. The Divine Woman - Serpent possesses terribly divine powers. Isis is our particul ar Divine Cosmic Mother. Each one of us has his own Isis. The Divine Mother Kundalini - Isis assists and helps us, with the condition that we have upright behavior. The Power of Isis is reinforced by the electric sexual power in the Flaming Forge of Vulcan. The Forge of Vulcan is in sex. The transcendental sexual electricity intensifies the power of Isis. We can invoke Isis - Marah during the chemical copulation. We will then receive help. If we invoke the Divine Mother - Serpent, Isis, Adonia, in the Ninth Spher e, that is to say, if we invoke her during sex, during the moment of the chemical coitus, then, She can disintegrate any psychological defect. CHAPTER 25 And Jesus answered and said unto Mary: “Well said, Mary: thou questionest finely with thy excellent question, and thou throwest light on all things with surety and precision. Now, therefore, from now on will I hide nothing from you, but I will reveal unto you all things with surety and openness. Hearken then, Mary, and give ear, all ye disciples: Before I made proclamation to all the archons of the Aeons and to all the rulers of the Fate and of the Sphere, they were all bound in their bonds and in their spheres and in their seals, as Yew, the Overseer of the Light, had bound them from the beginning; and e very one of them remained in his order, and every one journeyed according to his course, as Yew, the Overseer of the Light, had established them”. Yew, the profoundly sacred name, is related with the Light and clairvoyance. It is written that Jesus, the G reat Kabir, chanted a song of praise in the Great Name. It is written that He pronounced the profoundly sacred name Yew and He blew in their eyes saying, “Ye are now clairvoyant.”"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 48 Unquestionably, Yew is a mantric word or magic key related with clairvoyance . The word Yew appears in the Gnostic Mass. The coming of Melchisedec “And when the time of the number of Melchisedec, the great Receiver of the Light, came, he was wont to come into the midst of the Aeons and of all the archons who are bound in the sphe re and in the Fate, and he carried away the purification of the light from all the rulers of the Aeons and from all the archons of the Fate and from those of the sphere - for he carried away then that which brings them into agitation and he set in motion the hastener who is over them, and made them turn their circles swiftly, and he [the hastener] carried away their power which was in them and the breath of their mouth and the tears [ waters] of their eyes and the sweat of their bodies.” Melchisedec is the p lanetary Genie of the Earth, of whom Jesus, the Great Kabir, gave testimony. Melchisedec is the Great Receiver of the Cosmic Light. Melchisedec has a physical body. He is a Man, or better if we say, he is a Super Man. The Kingdom of Agharti is found in the subterranean caverns of the Earth. The Earth is hollow and the networks of caverns constitute Agharti. The Genie of the Earth lives in Agharti with a group of survivors from Lemuria and Atlantis. The Goros, powerful Lords of life and death, work with Melc hisedec. The whole ancient Wisdom of the centuries has been recorded on Stone, within the Kingdom of Agharti. When Abraham was returning from the slaughter of the Kings of Sodom and Gomorra, with whom he had fought, he found Melchisedec. Melchisedec lived in a fort situated in the place where Jerusalem, the beloved city of the Prophets, was raised at a later time. Abraham gave to Melchisedec his tithes and his goods, as the Law commands it. Melchisedec has an immortal physical body. It is stated that Melchi sedec and his people, and Abraham and his people celebrated the holy Gnostic Unction with the distribution of bread and wine in that time. It was then when Melchisedec delivered the Holy Grail to Abraham. Much later in time, this Chalice was carried by the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon. The Queen of Sheba submitted many ordeals to Solomon, before she surrendered this divine jewel. The great Kabir Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with the sacred Chalice. Joseph of Arimathaea filled the Chalice with the bloo d that was flowing from the body of the Adorable One, on the Mount of the Skulls. The Roman Senator hid the Chalice and the Lance, with which Longinus wounded the side of the Lord. When the Roman police entered the home of the Senator Joseph of Arimathaea, they found neither the Chalice nor the Lance. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 49 Joseph of Arimathaea was enclosed within a prison for a long time for such a motive. After leaving the jail, Joseph of Arimathaea took the sacred relics (Chalice and Lance) and went to Rome. He disgracefully found Nero persecuting the Gnostic Christians there. He traveled along the Mediterranean, and one night, in his dreams, he was approached by an Angel who told him, “That Chalice has a great power, because it contains the blood of the Redeemer of the World . Keep it there.” The Angel then showed him the Temple of Monserrat, in Cataluña, Spain. Joseph of Arimathaea hid the Chalice and the Lance within that Temple. Therefore, the Holy Grail and the Lance of Longinus, the Roman Centurion, are found in the Castl e of the Grail in transcendental Monsalvat. It is necessary to emphatically affirm that the Temple of the Grail is found in Jinn state. The Chalice symbolizes the feminine Yoni. The Lance allegorizes the phallus of Greek Mysteries. The Mysteries of Lingam - Yoni are found hidden in the Chalice and the Lance. The path that leads to the inner Self - realization of the Being is absolutely sexual. Melchisedec, in the midst of the Aeons and the Rulers, always carries away that which he must carry away, for the good of this suffering humanity. The Genie of the Earth, in constant manner, continuously overtakes the purified Light, absorbs it and attracts it towards our Earth world, in order to help the Souls. We must not forget that the Aeons and Archons are banished to the Sphere and to the Fate. It is possible, individually speaking, to settle the affairs of the Law with the Rulers and the Aeons of the Fate and the Sphere, by means of forgiveness and negotiations. So, this is what signifies, “to carry away the purifica tion of the light from all the rulers of the Aeons and from all the archons of the Fate and from those of the sphere.” That is why it is stated that Melchisedec “carried away their power which was in them and the breath of their mouth and the tears of thei r e and the sweat of their bodies.” Melchisedec, in ourselves and for ourselves, as Lord of this planetary abode in which we live, put in motion the hastener who is over them, and made them turn their circles swiftly. This means that the acceleration of ou r inner Self - realization is always possible based on conscious works, voluntary sufferings, negotiations and forgiveness. Melchisedec answers for all the Souls of the Earth. Jesus, the Great Kabir, was made a High Priest forever, in accordance with the ord er of Melchisedec. “For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed him “To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all: first being by interpretations King of justice, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace. “ “Without (earthly) Father, without (earthly) Mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually.” (Hebrews 7: 1 - 3) "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 50 Of the Fashioning of the souls of men “And Melchisedec, the Receiver of the Light, purfieth those powers and carrieth their light into the Treasury of the Light, white the servitors of all the archons gather together all matter from them all; and the servitors of alt the rulers of the Fate and the servitors of the sphere which is below the Aeons, take it and fashion it into souls of men and cattle and reptiles and wild - beasts and birds, and send them down into the world of mankind. And Further the receivers of the sun and the receivers of the moon, if they look above and see the configurations of the paths of the Aeons and the configurations of the Fate and those of the sphere, then they take from them the light - power; and the receivers of the sun get it ready and deposit it, until they hand it over to the receivers of Melchisedec, the Light - purifier. And their material refuse they bring to the sphere which is below the Aeons, and fashion it into [soul of] men, and fashion it also into souls of reptiles and of cattle and of wild - beasts and of birds, according to the circle of the rulers of that sphere and according to all the configuration of its revolution, and they cast them into this world of mankind, and they become souls in this region, as I have just said unto you.” Time after time, Melchisedec, the Genie of the Earth, must purify the powers of this world with sacrifices and terrible transformations. Great cataclysms are necessary. Thus, this is how Melchisedec must purify the powers of th e soul of the world and carry its light to the Treasury of the Light. An exact parallel indicates to us that the same must occur within the microcosmic human, when he wants to attain the inner Self - realization of the Being. The Workers of the Great Work in tensely work on themselves and on the Universe. This is specified in every religion’s Genesis. It is imperative for us to perform within ourselves what the Army of the Word performed within the Macrocosm. The Servitors of all the Rulers gathered and gather together all matter from them all. This refers to the gathering of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury for the Great Work. The Great Work is created by means of wisely combining Salt, Sulphur and Mercury. Those who have performed the Great Work present it to the R eceivers of Melchisedec. Those who have performed the Great Work enter into the Sacred Order of Melchisedec. The material refuse is cast into the infernal worlds, which means, into the submerged sphere, which is below the Aeons, the region of the beasts, w hich personify our defects of a psychological type. These frightful things emerge from the abyss, according to the circle of the Rulers of that Sphere and according to all the configuration of its revolution, and the Rulers cast them into this world of man kind. In the final synthesis, we can crystallize the Soul within ourselves by means of Buddhist and Christic annihilation, meaning, by disintegrating psychic aggregates, or Dry Mercury. The Receivers of the Sphere, who are below the Aeons, perform marvelou s works that are not even remotely suspected by people."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 51 The Receivers of the Sphere can fashion the material refuse, which falls in the Sphere that is below the Aeons. They can fashion such material refuse into souls of reptiles and wild - beasts, and birds, according to all the configurations of its revolution, and they cast them into this world of mankind, and they become souls in this region, as I have just said unto you. The Receivers of the Sphere can and must direct the involuted process of wild - beasts , reptiles, cattle, furious bulls and demons with crocodile faces within the submerged sphere, which is below the Aeons. Such beasts from the Averno are psychic aggregates that personify psychological defects; the inferno’s own spawns, egos that come from human organisms. The Rulers of the Sphere, which are below the Aeons, have power over life and death. The Rulers of that submerged Sphere direct the tides of life and death. Concretely, we shall say that the Rulers of the infernal submerged Sphere, which i s below the Thirteen Aeons, have power in order to work with the living creatures that dwell on the surface of the Earth, and power in order to work with the beasts of the abyss. The psychic aggregates, which constitute the ego, have animal form. Those who enter the infernal worlds devolve within time, until the Second Death. The Soul is liberated through the Second Death. The Essence then enters into Eden in order to restart, or reinitiate new evolving processes that must emerge from within the mineral kin gdom, continuing in the plant kingdom, and proceeding in the animal kingdom, until conquering once again the human state which was lost in the past. All of this work with souls of men and beasts on the surface of the world, and in the Sphere which is belo w the thirteen Aeons, is directed by the Rulers of the Averno. CHAPTER 26 “This then they accomplished continuously before their power was diminished in them and they waned and became exhausted, or powerless. It came to pass then, when they became powerl ess, that their power began to cease in them, so that they became exhausted in their power, and their light, which was in the region, ceased and their kingdom was destroyed, and the universe became quickly raised up. “It came to pass then, when they had pe rceived this at the time, and when the number of the cipher of Melchisedec, the Receiver [the Light], happened, then had he to come out again and enter into the midst of the archons of all the Aeons and into the midst of all the archons of the Fate and of those of the sphere: and he threw them into agitation, and made them quickly abandon their circles. And forthwith they were constrained, and cast forth the power out of themselves, out of the breath of their mouth and the tears of their eyes and the sweat of their bodies.” Unquestionably, when the Solar Gods fell into animal generation, they then converted themselves into lunar Gods. When the Solar Gods became lunar, their power began to cease in them, so that they became exhausted in their power. Thus, wi thout energies, they fell. Then, the number of the cipher of Melchisedec, the Receiver of the Light, took place. Hence, the Great Being entered into action."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 52 Melchisedec, in action and with a strong hand, governs the Archons of all the Aeons, and the Rulers of the Fate, and those Rulers of the Sphere. Melchisedec, in action, makes these Hierarchies quickly abandon their respective circles when they commit the error of falling into animal generation. Therefore, from that moment, these Lords find themselves co nstrained to search for their power outside of themselves, in the vain world. Indubitably, the Solar Gods, when converted into lunar creatures, suffer terribly, as anyone. The rulers devour their matter so that souls may not be fashioned “Melchisedec, th e Receiver of the Light, purifieth them, as he doth continually; he carrieth their light into the Treasury of the Light. And all the archons of the Aeons and the archons of the Fate and those of the sphere turn to the matter of their refuse; they devour it and do not let it go and become souls in the world. They devour then their matter, so that they may not become powerless and exhausted and their power cease in them and their kingdom become destroyed, but in order that they may delay and linger a long tim e until the completion of the number of the perfect souls who shall be in the Treasury of the Light.” Notwithstanding, Melchisedec, the Genie of the Earth, the Receiver of the Light, shows the way of purification to the fallen Gods through his Adepts. Mel chisedec can carry the light of the Souls to the Treasury of the Light. We have previously stated that the Golden Fleece, the Treasury of the Light, is found within the profundities of oneself. Unquestionably, the Archons of the Fate and the Rulers of the Aeons and those of the Sphere turn to the matter of their refuse. They subdue it, devour it, subjugate it, govern it, and do not let it go to become Souls in the world. This means that they, the Rulers, maintain the elemental Essences in their respective K ingdoms. Such elemental Essences are governed by the Archons. However, while the elemental Essences develop, they pass from one Kingdom to another, in accordance to the Law. Every elemental Essence can convert itself into a human Soul, at its time and hour , and in accordance to the Law. The completion of the number of the perfect Souls who shall be in the Treasury of the Light will be in the day of “Be with us”, which is the end of the Great Cosmic Day. CHAPTER 27 “It came to pass then, when the archons o f the Aeons and those of the Fate and those of the sphere continued to carry out this type, -- turning on themselves, devouring the refuse of their matter, and not allowing souls to be born into the world of mankind, in order that they might delay in being rulers, and that the powers which are in their powers, that is the souls, might spend a long time here outside, -- they then persisted doing this continually for two circles."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 53 “It came to pass then, when I wished to ascend for the ministry for the sake of which I was called by command of the First Mystery, that I came up into the midst of the tyrants of the archons of the twelve Aeons, with my light - vesture about me, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the light which was about me.” May the Sun that illuminates you shine within you, and may the tyrants that enslave you be reborn as human beings, in order to teach and illuminate you perpetually. Thus, they will devour the refuse of the matter, liberating those who must be liberated. The Lo rds of the Law will continue to be Rulers as long as their human persons respect the Law. This is easily comprehended when we know that the Lords of the Law are also reincarnating, and for such motive, they possess a human body. The term ‘tyrants’ is merel y symbolic or allegoric, or simply seen from another angle, it is a symbolic term from the point of view of the ‘super - human’. The powers of the Rulers are within our own Soul. The Laws of the Archons of the Aeons and of the Fate, and of those from the sph ere of action in which we move ourselves are within our own Soul. We always spend a long time here outside, in this Valley of Tears, for a duration of two circles or in two circles, the external and the internal, the exoteric and the esoteric, and the visi ble and the occult. Finally, the real human being is Christified and victoriously ascends in order to practice the Ministry, which was appointed to him by order of the Father of all the Lights, the Ancient of Days. The Christified Adept must rise up into t he midst of the Tyrants of the Rulers of the Twelve Aeons, with his Vesture of Light shining most exceedingly.

This then they did, not knowing against whom they fought.” Adamas, the ‘Tyrant’, and all the ‘tyrants’ of the Law of Karma who govern the Twelve Aeons oppose the step of the human being who marches towards the Final Liberation. ‘Tyrants’ is an allegoric matter. The Lords of the Law are just, and they co llect the debts from those who march towards their Liberation. Obviously, we must convert ourselves into an “Adeptus Exentus”. Jesus taketh from them a third of their power and changeth their course “When then they mutinied and fought against the light, thereon by command of the First Mystery I changed the paths and the courses of their Aeons and the paths of their fate and of the sphere. I made them face six months towards the triangles on the left and towards the squares and towards those in their aspec t and towards their octagons, just as they had formerly been. But their manner of turning, or facing, I changed to another"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 54 order, and made them other six months face towards the works of their influences in the squares on the right and in their triangles a nd in those in their aspect and in their octagons. And I made them to be confounded in great confusion and deluded in great delusion the archons of the Aeons and all the archons of the Fate and those of the sphere; and I set them in great agitation, and th ence on they were no longer able to turn towards the refuse of their matter to devour it, in order that their regions may continue to delay and they [themselves] may spend a long time as archons. “But when I had taken away a third of their power, I changed their spheres, so that they spend a time facing to the left and another time facing to the right. I have changed their whole path and their whole course, and I have made the path of their whole course, and I have made the path of their course to hurry, so that they may be quickly purified and raised up quickly. And I have shortened their circles, and made their path speedier, and it will be exceedingly hurried. And they were thrown into confusion in their path, and from then on were no more able to devour the matter of the refuse of the purification of their light.” It is not unjust to collect the debts from those who owe. However, the one who fights for his Liberation suffers immensely, and feels that the Agents of the Law are tyrants. The Intimate Christ , by command of the First Mystery, can change within ourselves the paths and courses of the Fate and the sphere in which we live, with the purpose that we may obtain our Christification. Unquestionably, we must learn how to walk with two feet if we want to reach the Christification. We must walk intensely with the Sixth Mystery, towards the triangles on the left. The Four - and - Twentieth Mystery cannot function without the Sixth Mystery. The First Mystery is hidden within the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery. The s quares of upright behavior and the octagons of the Eightfold Path, in the diverse aspects, are the foundation of the Great Work. The squares to the right and the triangles and their octagons in their diverse aspects serve as a foundation to the Great Work. In synthesis, six months towards the right and six months towards the left with their triangles and squares and octagons in the diverse aspects enclose the work of the Great Work. Triangles signify the three Primary Forces of Nature and the Cosmos. Square s signify upright behavior. Octagons signify eight Initiations, eight Initiatic qualifications, etc. The entire Secret Path that leads to the final Liberation is marked with triangles squares and octagons. Six months towards the right and six months toward s the left means half Light and half Darkness. The Sages must work for epochs within the Light, and for epochs within the Darkness of No Being. This type of Gnostic work, which is, for epochs within the Light, and for epochs within the Darkness, confuse ma ny. Therefore, there are very few who attain the total inner Self - realization of the Being."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 55 Remember the Sixth Arcanum, sex, love, the work in the Forge of the Cyclops. It is urgent to work within the super - obscurity and the august silence of the Wise, in determined epochs. It is indispensable to work within the Light during certain times. Every ascent is preceded by a descent. Every exaltation is preceded by a frightful and terrible humiliation. It is necessary to live among the demons in the infernal worl ds, working within triangles, squares and octagons. It is indispensable to live within the Light, working within triangles, octagons, and squares. Light and Darkness are opposed, yet, they compliment each other. At this precise moment, it is beneficial to transcribe the Hermetic foundation, which is related to what we are stating. The Emerald Tablet, by Hermes Trismegistus “It is true, no lie, certain, and to be depended upon, the superior agrees with the inferior, and the inferior with the superior, to e ffect that one truly wonderful work. As all things owe their existence to the will of the Only One, so all things owe their origin to the One Only Thing, the most hidden, by the arrangement of the Only God. “The Father of that One Only Thing is the Sun, i ts Mother is the Moon, the Wind carries it in its belly; but its nourse is a Spirituous Earth. That One Only Thing is the Father of all things in the Universe, its power is perfect, after it is has been united to a Spirituous Earth. “Separate that Spiritu ous Earth from the dense or crude by means of a gentle heat, with much attention. In great measure it ascends from the Earth up to Heaven, and the superior and the inferior are increased in power.” “By this thou wilt partakes of the honours of the whole w orld. And the Darkness will fly thee.” “This is the strength of all powers. With this thou wilt be able to overcome all things and to transmute all what is fine and what is coarse. In this manner, the world was created; the arrangements to follow this roa d are hidden. In this is hidden the Wisdom of the whole world.” Without sexua1 magic and without the infernal worlds, it is impossible to comprehend the previous paragraphs of Hermes Trismegistus. Unquestionably, the Path of the inner Self - realization of the Being is frightfully difficult. The Initiate must pass far beyond good and evil. The Adept must fight not only against the forces of evil, but moreover, he must also fight against the forces of good. The rocky Path is surrounded by frightful abysses, w hich are impossible to describe with words."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 56 At times the path is lost within quicksand, at times it is cut by terrible precipices, at times we must ascend or descend towards the darkness of No Being. At times, a beautiful virtue, which has no evil, can con vert itself into an insurmountable obstacle that stops the march of the walker. The descent into the darkness of No Being used to scare the walkers of the lonely path. The virtuous ones slander the walkers who descend into the abode of Pluto. Nevertheless, we must not ever mistake a fall with a descent. In all of this exist terrible confusions. The Rulers of the Fate, and the Archons of the Aeons, and those of the sphere in which we live, whose powers are within our own Soul, become terribly confused. They are agitated within the Soul of the walker. The matter of the refuse does not attract those who march along the difficult path. They already do not consume garbage and they only feed themselves with sepulchral food offered to the Gods. It is not very pleas ing to continue as Rulers of undesirable things. The Intimate Christ does not change the sphere of the Rulers within ourselves, so that the Rulers may equilibrate their work between Light and Darkness. This is how we can purify ourselves rapidly, so that w e can be elevated, In this way the circles remain abbreviated and the path is quickly completed. The Buddhist Annihilation is fundamental for the radical Christification. The Rulers of the Aeons and those of the Fate and those of the sphere of action in wh ich we live, who are within ourselves, and who are autonomous and conscious parts of our own Being, want the radical elimination of the animal ego. It is not possible to establish correct relations in the diverse parts of our own Being, unless we previousl y eliminate the psychic aggregates. . The entire ensembles of psychic aggregates, which are living personifications of our psychological defects, constitute the ego, the ‘I’. Disgracefully, the Essence, the Consciousness, is found bottled up within these p sychic aggregates. Thus, the Consciousness processes itself by virtue of its own embottlement. Now we better comprehend why humanity is found in such a hypnotic state, unconscious and asleep. The correct relation with oneself is not possible as long as the animal ego continues to thrive within us. They no more have the power of devouring their matter And moreover I have shortened their times and their periods, so that the perfect number of souls who shall receive the mysteries and be in the Treasury of th e Light, shall be quickly completed For had I not changed their courses, and had I not shortened their periods, they would not have let any soul come into the world, because of the matter of the refuse which they devoured, and they would have destroyed man y souls. For this cause I said unto you aforetime; ‘I have shortened the times because of my elect; otherwise no soul would have been able to be saved.’ And I have shortened the times and the periods because of the perfect number of the souls who shall rec eive the mysteries, that is to say, the ‘elect’; and had I not shortened their periods, no material souls would have been saved, but they would have perished in the fire which is in the flesh of the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 57 rulers. This then is the word on which thou dost question me with precision.” it came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his disciples, that they fell down all together, adored him and said to him: “Blessed are we before all men, for unto us thou hast revealed these great exploits.” The diverse, autonomous and self - conscious parts of our Being are represented within our own Soul by the Rulers of the Aeons and of those of the Fate and those of the Sphere. They do not desire to devour the matter of the refuse of the purification of the ir Light. Christ, our Lord, reduces times and periods in order that we may quickly receive the Mysteries and be in the Treasury of the Light. Nevertheless, we must work on ourselves intensely if we wish to receive help from the Intimate Christ. Strike with thy rod while thou beg to thy God. Without death, there is no Resurrection. If you do not die, then you will not be resurrected. The death, which we refer to in these paragraphs, is not the death of the physical body. Resurrection is not necessary for the death of the physical body. The immortal Soul does not need the resurrection of the physical body. The terrible Judgment of the Lord is necessary before Resurrection. Obviously we must be judged and we must die before the profound inner Resurrection. The tyrant, the ego that we carry within ourselves must die, if we truly long for the resurrection of Christ within ourselves. We will continue to be unconscious and perverse, submerged in pain, as long as the Being is not resurrected. The death of the ego and the Resurrection of the Being within ourselves must occur during life. The Being and the ego are incompatible. The Being and the ego are like water and oil. They can never be mixed. Only the resurrected Souls will be in the Treasury of the Light. Total il lumination is only for the resurrected Beings, for the perfect Souls. The Intimate Christ within ourselves changes courses and shortens periods, with the objective that the Soul may crystallize within our human personality. Each psychic aggregate within ou rselves is the living personification of a psychological defect. It is unquestionable that when a psychological defect is disintegrated, that it is replaced with a virtue, power, force or law, which crystallizes within our human personality. This is how we are crystallizing the Soul little by little. Obviously, even the physical body must be converted into Soul. Therefore, the Soul is the whole assembly of forces and spiritual powers that must be crystallized within ourselves. This is how the Soul enters th is world. This is how the Souls arrive to the Earth. However, if the water does not boil at one hundred degrees, that which must be crystallized does not crystallize, and that which must be eliminated is not eliminated. Similarly, we affirm that we must pa ss through great emotional crises before attaining the disintegration of any psychic aggregate. It is not enough to comprehend a defect. It is necessary to eliminate it."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 58 It is urgent to know how to meditate, in order to comprehend any psychic aggregate, or in other words, any psychological defect. It is indispensable to know how to work with all our heart and with all our soul, if we want the elimination to occur. When we beseech Stella Mans, the Virgin of the Sea, we are assisted. The Divine Mother Kundali ni the Igneous Serpent of our magical powers can and must eliminate the psychic aggregates. Each one of us has his individual, particular Cosmic Mother. The transcendental sexual electricity, in the Forge of the Cyclops, reinforces Stella Maris. Obviously, this is why it is preferable to invoke the Igneous Serpent of our magical powers while in the Flaming Forge of Vulcan, during the precise moment of metaphysical copulation. This is how we can and must precipitate the death of the tyrant whom we carry with in. In this way the Souls can rapidly come to the Earth. The matter of refuse, the psychic aggregates, the living representations of our psychological defects impede the arrival of the Souls into the world. This is why it is absolutely necessary to elimina te defects and to crystallize the Soul. The perfect number of Souls who will receive the Mysteries of the Light is ineffable. If Christ had shortened the periods within ourselves, then no Soul would have been able to be saved. In other words, this signifie s that the crystallization of the Soul in human persons would have been unsuccessful. The fire of the abominable Kundartiguador organ, the negative fire that burns in the atomic infernos of the intellectual animal, mistakenly called human being, would have annulled every intent of psychic crystallization. Thus, it would have been impossible for the Souls to arrive on the Earth. In the former verses, psychic crystallization, or the arrival of the Souls is perceived as a synonym, or something similar. CHAPTE R 28 The powers adore the light - vesture. And Jesus continued again in his discourse and said unto his disciples: “Hearken concerning the things which befell me among the rulers of the twelve Aeons and all their rulers and their lords and their authoritie s and their angels and their archangels. When then they had seen the vesture of light, which was about me, they and their unpaired, then every one of them saw the mystery of his name that it was on my vesture of light, which was about me. They fell down al l together, adored the vesture of light, which was about me and cried out all together, saying: ‘How hath the lord of the universe passed through us without our knowing it?’ And they all sang praises together to the interiors of the interiors. And all thei r triple - powers and their great forefathers and their ungenerated and their self gene rated and their generated and their gods and their light - sparks and their light - bearers - in a word all their great ones - saw the tyrants of their region, that their po wer was diminished in them. And they were in weakness and themselves fell into great and immeasurable fear. And they gazed on the mystery of their name on my vesture,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 59 and they had set out to come and adore the mystery of their name which was on my vesture, and they could not because of the great light which was about me; but they adored a little removed from me, and they adored the light of my vesture and all cried out together, singing praises to the interiors of the interiors.” The Archons of the Twelve Aeons, their Lords and their Authorities, their Angels and their Archangels, are represented within ourselves by the distinct autonomous and self - conscious parts of our own Being. The powers of the Rulers of the Aeons, and those of the Fate and those of th e Sphere, are found within our own Soul. In the depth of our own Being we must find the Intimate Christ and His Vesture of Light. The mystery of the mystic name that each one of us carries within our own Being must be read on the Vesture of the Intimate Ch rist. Our mystic name has its profound significance in the Intimate Christ. The Intimate Christ has passed through the distinct corners of our Microcosmic Universe many times without us knowing it. The distinct, independent parts of our own Being sing prai ses to the Intimate Christ. The triple powers of the Being, and their forefathers and their ungenerated and their self - generated, and their Gods and their light - sparks and their light - bearers, whose powers are found within our own Soul, know very well that the tyrants, whom we carry within, succumb in front of the Lord. All the divine, inner powers adore the Intimate Christ. This is repeated in the Universe and in the human being, in the Macrocosm and in the Microcosm. The tyrants become as the dead “It c ame to pass then, when this befell among the tyrants who are below these rulers, that they all lost power and fell down to the ground in their Aeons and became as the dead world - dwellers with no breath in them as they became in the hour when I took from th em their power. “It came to pass then thereafter, when I left those Aeons, that every one of all those who were in the twelve Aeons, was bound to their order all together, and they accomplished their works as I have established them, so that they spend six months turned to the left and accomplishing their works in their squares and their triangles and those which are in their aspect, and that further they spend another six months facing to the right and towards their triangles and their squares and those wh ich are in their aspect. Thus then will those who are in the Fate and in the sphere travel.” The twelve Aeons are within ourselves, here and now. The twelve Aeons are atomic. The twelve Aeons are related with the twelve Zodiacal Orders. Leo is the most ex alted among the twelve Orders. Let us remember the ‘Lions of Fire’, the ‘Lions of Life’, the ‘Igneous Shapeless Breaths’, the Triple Divine Powers, who emanated from the active, omnipenetrant and omniscient Okidanokh."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 60 These ‘Lions of Fire’ are Kether, Chok mah, and Binah, true Dragons of Wisdom. The ten Sephiroth or emanations, plus the Ain Soph Aur and the Am Soph are in reality the twelve Aeons. The twelve Aeons are in reality twelve Regions. The Thirteenth Aeon is terribly divine. Each one of the Rulers o f the Aeons is bound to its Order. All the Rulers of the Aeons work in the Macrocosm and within the Microcosmic human being, in accordance with the Solar Logos. Part of the work must be performed in the Light, and part within the super - obscurity and the au gust silence of the Wise. We must not ever forget that the Inferno and Paradise exist right here and not in any other world. The Inferno is found situated within ourselves and within the womb of the Earth. Paradise is found situated within the Being and in the superior dimensions of the world. We can gain the right to enter into Paradise only by working in the Flaming Forge of Vulcan, which is situated in the Inferno and within the august darkness of No Being. The Inferno is the womb of Heaven. All the work s within Light or Darkness must be performed within triangles, octagons, and squares. We must clothe ourselves with the boots of the God Mercury. Thus, we, who are in the Fate and in the sphere, will then travel. CHAPTER 29 Jesus entereth the thirteenth aeon and findeth Pistis Sophia. “It came to pass then thereafter that I ascended to the veils of the thirteenth aeon. It came to pass then, when had I arrived at their veils, that they drew apart of their own accord and opened themselves for me. I entered in into the thirteenth aeon and found Pistis Sophia below the thirteenth aeon all alone and no one of them with her. And she sat in that region grieving and mourning, because she had not been admitted into the thirteenth aeon, her higher region. And she w as moreover grieving because of the torments which Self - willed, who is one of the three triple - powers, had inflicted on her. But this, -- when I shall come to speak with you respecting their expansion, I will tell you the mystery, how this befell her.” Th e Thirteenth Aeon reminds us of the thirteen Heavens of the Aztecs or Nahoas from ancient Mexico. There also exists thirteen Katuns among the Mayas of Yucatan, Palenque, and Central America in general. These are the thirteen prophetic Katuns, thirteen peri ods of time for each human race. Obviously, the prophecies for each one of the past Katuns of our A r yan Root Race were exactly fulfilled. Presently, we are approaching the Thirteenth Katun."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 61 The Mayas say that between the years 2040 and 2043, the Thirteenth Katun will enter into activity. The great catastrophe that will destroy this present humanity, which lives on the five continents of the world, will occur during the Thirteenth Katun. Our Solar System has thirteen Worlds, which are as follows: Earth, Merc ury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Vulcan, Persephone and Clarion. The thirteen Katuns, the thirteen Worlds, the thirteen Heavens of Anahuac are related with the thirteen Sephiroth of Hebraic Kabbalah, as follows: Ain, Ain Soph , Ain Soph Au r , Kether, Chokmah, Binah, Chesed, Geburah, Tiphereth, Netzach, Hod, Jesod, Malkuth. These are the thirteen Aeons or supra - sensible atomic Regions, which are mutually penetrating and co - penetrating without confusion. The Unmanifested Absolute is beyond these thirteen Aeons. Inside the human being, the Intimate Christ ascends within the resurrected Adept up to the terrific Mysteries of the Thirteenth Aeon. The Mysteries of the Thirteenth Aeon are opened in the presence of the Christified and res urrected Adept. Pistis Sophia is a compound word. Pistis Sophia signifies power - wisdom. Pistis signifies power. Sophia means wisdom. Unquestionably, the power is in the Fohat, which means in the Fire. The authentic Wisdom is converted into Fire. There exis ts the Fire of the fire, the Flame of the flame, which is the astral signature of the Fire. Obviously, Christ - Wisdom is the astral signature of the Fire. The terrific Mysteries of Pistis Sophia are within the Thirteenth Aeon. Obviously, Pistis Sophia emerg ed from within the bosom of the Cosmic Common Eternal Father. Ostensibly, Pistis Sophia emerged from within the Unmanifested Absolute and remained cast within the Thirteenth Aeon. We must pass through the Buddhist Annihilation if we wish to be betrothed wi th Pistis Sophia. Those who worship their ‘beloved ego’ will never find Pistis Sophia. Only through death comes newness. If the germ does not die, then the plant is not born. Pistis Sophia is found latent within each one of us, within our interior Universe . Only the death of the ego will permit us to be betrothed with Pistis Sophia, in order to ascend to the Thirteenth Aeon. Unquestionably, averted Eros or misguided Cupid, who is one of the three Triple - Powers, is what inflicts the worst damage on Pistis S ophia. However, we will never proclaim ourselves against Eros, Shiva, the Holy Spirit, or against Cupid - Eros, because we know very well that the key of all power is found within the tantric mysteries of Lingam - Yoni. Chaos - Gae, Eros, the Greek Trinity, invi tes us to reflect. Markedly, we only proclaim ourselves against averted Eros or misguided Cupid, which is fornication, adultery and sexual abuse.

She saw the mystery of her name on my vesture and the whole glory of its mystery, formerly she was in the region of the height, in the thirteenth aeon, -- but she was wont to sing praises to the higher light which she had seen in the veil of the Treasury of the Light. “It came to pass then, when she persisted in singing praises to the higher light, that all the rulers who a re with the two great triple - powers, and her invisible who is paired with her, and the other two - and - twenty invisible emanations gazed [the light], -- in as much as Pistis Sophia and her pair, they and the other two - and - twenty emanations make up four - and - twe nty emanations, which the great invisible Forefather and the two great triple - powers have emanated” Pistis Sophia, the divine Wisdom - Power, shines within the Christic Mysteries and in great agitation she palpitates and shakes within the Logoic Vestures. T he mystery of the name of Pistis Sophia is hidden in the Solar Logos. This is why it was always said to us that Christ is the Instructor of the world. “The supreme personality of God said: Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember all o f them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy! “Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I incarnate dominating my Prakriti and appear in my original transcendental form; servin g my self of my own maya. “Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion - at that time I descent Myself “To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to r eestablish the principles of Religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium. “One who knows the transcendental nature of my appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains my exter nal abode, O Arjuna!” [Bhagavad Gita] This quotation is from Bhagavad - Gita, the Hymn of the Lord. The Reincarnated Christ expresses himself through every authentic Avatar. Pistis Sophia gloriously shines within the Lord. The entire glory of the Mystery of Pistis Sophia is within Christ. Pistis Sophia descends from the Thirteenth Aeon and returns into the Thirteenth Aeon. Shining unmistakably within the Prophets, Pistis Sophia sings praises to the highest Light that exists within the Mysteries of the Treasu ry of the Light. Pistis Sophia utters with the sacred Verb of the great Hierophants. Pistis Sophia, Wisdom - Power made flesh within the incarnated Gods, gloriously shines. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 63 CHAPTER 30 Mary desireth to hear the story of Sophia. It came to pass then, when Jesus has said this unto his disciples, that Mary came forward and said; “My Lord, I have heard thee say aforetime; “Pistis Sophia is herself one of the four - and - twenty emanations, -- how then is she not in their region? But thou hast said: I found her be low the thirteenth aeon.” Marah, Ram - Io, Isis, Tonantzin, etc., is a variation of our own Being, but a derivative. Therefore, Marah, Diana, Isis, is our Divine Mother Kundalini, an autonomous and Self - conscious part of our Being. Marah interrogates the In timate Christ within us about Pistis Sophia. Obviously, Sophia, Divine Wisdom, Gnosis, emerges from the holy and mysterious Tetragrammaton and is attained with the Resurrection. At one time, in my rank of Adept, I invoked Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom, in side of a Lumisial. In the center of the Lumisial there was a triangular stone, which was sustained by a column. The invocation was performed in accordance with all the rules of Jamblicus’ High Theurgy. Suddenly the stone shone, and within it appeared the blue eyes of Minerva. The potent voice of Minerva, the one with blue eyes, resounded within the Lumisial. “I am Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom. What do you want from me?” I then answered firmly, “Wisdom!” “What do you want Wisdom for?” She asked. “In order to help humanity.” I answered. Minerva remained in absolute silence. Silence is the eloquence of Wisdom. When Minerva left, the triangular stone, which was held up upon the mysterious column remained there as an answer. Obviously, the three ingre dients of the Holy Triamatzikamno emerge from the active omnipresent and omnipenetrant Okidanokh. In other words, we state that the three Primary Forces of Nature and of the Cosmos emerge from the Great Breath, profoundly unknowable to itself. Unquestionab ly, the Great Breath has its roots in the Sacred Absolute Sun. The Sacred Absolute Sun wants to crystallize the three Primary Forces within us, here and now. When the three Primary Forces crystallize in us and within us, we then obtain Wisdom. Thus, when i ntegrated with Sophia, we ascend to the Thirteenth Aeon. If we do not learn how to perform the will of the Father in the superior worlds as well as in the physical world, then we cannot crystallize the first Force within Ourselves."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 64 If we do not disintegrat e the psychic aggregates, living personification of our psychological defects, then we cannot crystallize the second Force within ourselves. We cannot crystallize the third Force in ourselves, unless we previously create within ourselves the superior exist ential bodies of the Being. The first Force, the Holy Affirmation, is the Ray of the Father. The second Force, the Holy Negation, is the Ray of the Son. The third Force, the Holy Conciliation, is the Ray of the Holy Spirit. These are the three Forces: Posi tive, Negative, and Neutral. Whosoever obtains within himself the crystallization of the three Primary Forces of Nature, and of the Cosmos, in reality will know what Sophia is. Pistis Sophia, herself, is one of the four - and - twenty emanations. The Four - and - Twentieth Mystery, inside of which the First Mystery is hidden, is the Loom of God. The ‘Theomertmalogos’ weaves and unweaves its own Loom with infinite wisdom. All of Nature is the Loom of God. The Four - and - Twentieth Mystery only functions by way of the S ixth Mystery. When Hermes’ Glass is not spilled, the sacred sperm is transformed into the Mercury of the Wise. The connection of Lingam - Yoni, without the ejaculation of the Ens - Seminis, is fundamental for the preparation of the Mercury of the Wise. The pre pared Mercury ascends throughout the spinal medullar canal, opening centers and revolutionizing the Consciousness. The surplus of Mercury crystallizes into a superior octave, in the form of the Astral Body. The surplus of Mercury crystallizes into a second superior octave, in the form of the Mental Body. Then, the surplus of Mercury crystallizes into a third superior octave, in the form of the Causal Body. The Initiate who possesses the Physical, Astral, Mental and Causal bodies receives for such a motive t he psychic principles, and is converted into a true human being. This is how the Holy Spirit crystallizes within ourselves. The crystallized Holy Spirit within the Adept converts him into the gentleman, the illuminated gentleman (gentlewoman). When we pass through the Buddhist Annihilation, and when the ego is reduced to cosmic dust, then we christify ourselves. The Lord crystallizes within ourselves. When we have totally surrendered to the Father, the first Force crystallizes within ourselves. The Divine T rimurti within ourselves shines with Pistis Sophia.

She saw the light of the veil of the Treasury of the Light, and she longed to reach to that region, and she could not reach to that region. But she ceased to perform the mystery of the thirteenth aeon, and sang praises to the light of the height, which she had seen in the light of the veil of the Tre asury of the Light.” Pistis Sophia’s center of gravity is within the Thirteenth Aeon. The twenty - and - four emanations of the Great Invisible are within our own Being, here and now. The twenty - and - four emanations of the Great Invisible are the twenty - and - fo ur Zodiacal Elders. The twenty - and - four Elders gloriously shine in the Zodiacal Belt. The powers of the twenty - and - four Elders are found placed within the depth of our Soul. The twenty - and - four autonomous and Self - conscious parts of our own Being are the t wenty - and - four Elders, within our own individual Zodiac. By command of the First Mystery, Sophia gazes at the Light. She sees the Mysteries of the secret Treasury of the Light. We have stated that the Treasury of the Light must be searched for within our o wn Being. Within ourselves, Sophia wishes to reach the region where the Treasury of the Light is found. Sophia sings praises to the Light of the Heights, which she always sees in the Light of the Mysteries of the Treasury of the Light. The Treasury of the Light is the Golden Fleece of the ancients, guarded by the Dragon that throws fire and sulphur. The Golden Fleece, with all of its precious stones and incalculable wealth, is our own Christified and resurrected Being. Fortunate is the one who reaches Chris tification. Fortunate is the one who reaches Resurrection. Blessed be the one who defeats the Dragon and takes possession of the Golden Fleece. The rulers hate her for ceasing in their mystery “It came to pass then, when she sang praises to the region of the height, that all the rulers in the twelve Aeons, who are below, hated her, because she had ceased from their mysteries, and because she had desired to go into the height and be above them all. For this cause then they were enraged against her and hate d her, [as did] the great triple - powered Self - willed, that is the third triple - power, who is in the thirteenth aeon, he who had become disobedient, in as much as he had not emanated the whole purification of his power in him, and had not given the purifica tion of his light at the time when the rulers gave their purification, in that he desired to rule over the whole thirteenth aeon and those who are below it.”"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 67 Pistis Sophia can ascend or descend; ascend until the Thirteenth Aeon or descend until the Tartaru s. Pistis Sophia is within ourselves, here and now. The Rulers of the Twelve Aeons, who are within ourselves, and who are self independent parts of our own Being, suffer and long for the moment when Sophia is elevated to the height of the Thirteenth Aeon, the highest part of the Being. Whosoever perfects the highest part of the Being receives for such a motive the esoteric degree of ‘IS’. It could not be possible to perfect the highest part of the Being, unless we previously disintegrate the totality of the psychic aggregates that we carry within our interior. Each one of the psychic aggregates personifies one of our psychological defects. Each aggregate specifies one or another psychological defect. It could not be possible to perfect the superior parts of our own Being, unless we previously disintegrate all of those undesirable elements that we carry in our interior. The perfection of all the autonomous and Self - conscious parts of our own Being could not be gained in any way without the splendors of Pistis Sophia. When Pistis Sophia ascends to the superior Aeons, the less elevated levels of the Being suffer terribly, These are the nights of the Soul in which the diverse parts of the Being feel the absence of Sophia. These are the deserts of the Soul, nights of the Spirit, periods of solitude, and ordeals for the aspirants. The third triple power, mind, desire and sex, became independent and perverse. Mind, desire and sex become terribly perverse when falling into animal generation. This is why the adulterous and fornicating intellectual animal is always frightfully malignant. The intellectual mammal, mistakenly called human being, hates Pistis Sophia. Nevertheless, in the final synthesis, the third triple power comes from the Thirteenth Aeon. In the final syn thesis, all the parts of the Being emanate from the Thirteenth Aeon. The third triple power, filled with arrogance, wants to command over the Thirteen Aeons. When the third triple power emanates all of its millenary purifications from its power in itself, everything becomes different. In order for the third triple power, mind, astral and sex, to emanate millenary purifications, the Buddhist Annihilation is necessary. As long as the ego is alive, purification is absent. The Archons can give their purificati on when the psychic aggregates are annihilated. Self uniteth himself with the rulers of the twelve Aeons and emanateth a lion - faced power to plague Sophia “It came to pass then, when the rulers of the twelve Aeons were enraged against Pistis Sophia, who is above them, and hated her exceedingly, that the great triple - powered Self - willed, of whom I have just now told you, joined himself to the rulers of the twelve Aeons, and also was enraged against Pistis Sophia and hated her exceedingly, because she had t hought to go to the light which is higher than her.

And the rulers who abide, or persist, in performing the mystery, hated her, and all the guards who are at the gates of the Aeons, hated her also. “It came to pass then thereafter by command of the First Commandment th at the great triple - powered Self - willed, who is one of the three triple - powers, pursued Sophia in the thirteenth aeon, in order that she should look toward the parts below, so that she might see in that region his lion - faced light - power and long after it a nd go to that region, so that her light might be taken from her.” The Archons of the Twelve Aeons within ourselves suffer because of Pistis Sophia, who is above them. They do not know what to do. Obviously, the third triple power (mind, astral and sex) is joined to the general discontentment of the Rulers of the Twelve Aeons. This means that the terrestrial human suffers for Pistis Sophia. You know this. Mind, desire, and sex are found to be restless because of Pistis Sophia. The violent, passionate emanat ions and the lion - faced power arrive to the inferior regions. The tenebrous powers, which dwell within the lower animal depth of the human being, want to deprive Pistis Sophia of her power. They never forgive her for illuminating the Mysteries that are in the superior levels of the Being. The Rulers are found to be displeased because Sophia does not manifest her Mystery in all the parts. She hides the Mysteries when they must be hidden: “Silence is the eloquence of Wisdom.” We must never forget that the Arc hons of the Aeons, and the Guardians of the same Aeons, are diverse Self - conscious parts of our own Being. Our Being looks like an army of innocent children. Each part of the individual Being is Self - conscious and even autonomous. Fortunate is the one who obtains the integration of the Being. In the infernal worlds, the Adept must work in order to be illuminated by Pistis Sophia. Pistis Sophia must also be assimilated by those who work consciously in the Averno. Pistis Sophia has her center of gravity withi n the Thirteenth Aeon. The third triple power cries, prays, and asks for light to Pistis Sophia, even though she abides in the Thirteenth Aeon. Pistis Sophia moves through all the Aeons. She ascends, descends, and also travels underneath the Aeons. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 69 CH APTER 31 Sophia taketh the lion - faced power of Self - willed for the true Light “It came to pass then thereafter that she looked below and saw his light - power in the parts below; and she knew not that it is that of the triple - powered Self - willed, but she t hought that it came out of the light which she had seen from the beginning in the height, which came out of the veil of the Treasury of the Light. And she thought to herself I will go into that region without my pair and take the light and thereout fashion for myself light - aeons, so that I may go to the Light of lights, which is in the Height of heights.” The terrestrial, great triple - powered Self - willed has its own intellection. It is easy to mistake the light of this intellection with the Light that come s from the Treasury of the Light. Moreover, this intellection even feels that it is very capable of stealing the light of the Great Treasury and thereout fashion for itself light - aeons or Genii. Thus, sequentially, it hallucinates of reaching the power tha t permits it to reach the Light of lights, which is in the Height of heights. Therefore, we must make a clear differentiation between Sophia and the subjective reasoning of the intellectual mammal, mistakenly called human being. It is better to think in ob jective reasoning. Yet, for this, we must know the three existing minds. The first is the sensual mind. The second is the intermediate mind. The third is the interior mind. The first mind elaborates its concepts with its contents, by way of the data obtain ed with external sensorial perceptive senses. Therefore, it cannot know anything about that which is the Reality. The second mind is the deposit of religious beliefs. The third mind functions only with the data of the awakened Consciousness. The leaven of the materialistic and incredulous Sadducees is in the first mind. The leaven of the hypocritical Pharisees, who do not work on themselves, is in the second mind. In the third mind is Sophia, Divine Wisdom, who is based on the direct and lively experience o f that which is not of time. Jesus, the great Kabir, warned us by saying, “Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.” The materialistic doctrines of the Sadducees always rotate inside their vicious circle, which are their ex ternal sensorial perceptions. Therefore, they cannot know anything about that which is the Reality, about that which is beyond time. Obviously, the Truth is beyond the body, affections and mind. The fanatical Sadducees, materialists, and incredulous ones a re born in time and they are lost in time. They do not know the Reality. The hypocritical Pharisees believe, yet they do not know anything about that which is beyond time."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 70 Only Pistis Sophia knows by direct mystical experience. However, she is related only with the interior mind. Real experience of that which is the Truth is only possible with Pistis Sophia. Nevertheless, the opening of the interior mind and the advent of Sophia is possible only by awakening the Consciousness. Pistis Sophia is a living expe rience, manifested as the objective reasoning of the Being. The interior mind could never function as objective reasoning, without previously having passed through the Buddhist Annihilation. The absolute Resurrection of the Being is more than impossible wi thout the radical death. If you do not die, then your Consciousness will not be resurrected. The awakening of the Consciousness, the opening of the interior mind, and the advent of Sophia, is made possible only by the Resurrection of the Being. Sophia is t he objective reasoning of the Being, the awakened Consciousness. The complete functionalism of Pistis Sophia is within the objective reasoning of the Being. In Gnostic Christic Esoterism, we are always quoting six degrees of the conscious objective reasoni ng of the Being. The degrees of development of the objective reasoning of the Being are known by the number of tridents that are shown on the horns of the Individual Lucifer, who is within each one of us. Obviously, the Individual Lucifer within each one o f us is a reflection of the Logos (Christ) within our interior. This is why he is referred to us as Christus - Lucifer. Lucifer gives us the sexual impulse. Therefore, Lucifer is the stairs to ascend and the stairs to descend. We arise; we ascend, when defea ting Lucifer. Lucifer, integrated with ourselves, converts us into Archangels. When the fourth Trident appears over the horns, then the objective reasoning of the Being has been perfected up to the sacred Ternoonald. Therefore, only two gradations remain b efore obtaining the Anklad degree. The reasoning of the sacred Anklad is the most transcendental and luminous gradation that any Being can attain, and it corresponds to the third degree, in relation to the absolute reasoning of the Infinitude that sustains all. The reasoning of the sacred Podkoolad is the final gradation before the sacred Anklad. The fifth Trident over the horns indicates the degree of the sacred Podkoolad. The sixth Trident over the horns marks the degree of the sacred Anklad. It is necess ary to know about the Taurinean Mysteries in order not to alarm ourselves with the luminous horns of Christus - Lucifer within each one of us. Let us remember the horns of silver of Great Hierophants. The horns of demons are the fatal antithesis of the horns of light. The horns of the tenebrous ones grow in accordance with each evil action. Therefore, we must not confuse the horns of the demons with the luminous horns of Christus - Lucifer. The great triple powered (mind, desire and sex), in complete degenerati on, has nothing to do with the degrees of the objective reasoning of the Being. Therefore, the intellectual animal does not know anything about Pistis Sophia.

The rulers of the Aeons pursued her and were enraged against her, because she had thought of grandeur. And she went forth also from the twelve Aeons, and came into the regions o f the chaos and drew night to that lion - faced light - power to devour it.” Sophia, departing out from the Thirteenth Aeon, is something tremendous. This invites us to the evident self - reflection of the Being. Consequently, the Thirteenth Aeon, the “13 - Serpe nt”, is frightfully divine. The form of the Cross of Saint Andrew is prominent in the crown of the “13 - Woman Serpent”. The Mercury and the Sulphur being crossed and crossed throughout the Great Work take us to the “13 th ” Aeon. The Metallic Soul of the sacr ed sperm is the Mercury. Unquestionably, the Mercury of the Wise must be fecundated by the Sulphur, in other words, by the Fire. Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury must ascend throughout the medullar spinal canal, awakening in the human being all the powers, which make him divine. Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury are the vitriol of the Wise. The Gold for the superior existential bodies of the Being is obtained only by multiplying the vitriol. The Spirit of the Gold is the sacred sperm. The Antimony is one part of the Bei ng. It is the great Alchemist who fastens the Gold into the superior existential bodies of the Being. The bodies of Gold, mutually penetrating and co - penetrating without becoming confused, constitute ‘To Soma Heliakon’, the body of Gold of the Solar Man. T he Intimate Christ, covered with this metallic cover of Gold, is the Philosophical Stone. Whosoever possesses the Philosophical Stone, the Red Carbuncle, is married with Pistis Sophia. Consequently, he can reach the Thirteenth Aeon. Woman - Serpent, numeral thirteen, indicates supreme death and supreme liberation. Pistis Sophia descends to the twelve Aeons, when she considers it to be indispensable. In no way do the Archons of the Aeons, who are in ourselves, wish to remain without Sophia. The Rulers of the Aeons feel that they are alone without Sophia, when she is rising towards the Thirteenth Aeon. Sophia can also penetrate into the Chaos. Since Pistis Sophia in essence is Logoic, she can penetrate into the Chaos. We know very well that the ‘Great Abyss’ o f the eternal waters is found between Binah and Chesed. Any Kabbalist who consults the Tree of Life knows this. The Divine Ray and the Chaos, Pistis Sophia and the Great Abyss, shine with pleasure when united. Thus, the Chaos delectably sparkles when obtai ning its meaning from this union with the Spirit."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 72 The Logoic Ray, impregnated by Sophia, fecundates the waters of life, in order for the Universe to emerge. The Logos fecundates Marah, Mary, the Eternal Mother Space. Marah, Mary, conceives the Universe in the Dawn of Creation. Marah, Mary, the Chaos, is the Great Ocean. Marah, Mary, as Divine Mother of the Adept, is Stella Mans, the ‘Virgin of the Sea’, Devi Kundalini. Marah, Mary, weeps at the foot of the cross, with her heart pierced with seven daggers. T he Virgin of the Sea is the Wife of the Holy Spirit. “As above so below.” Sophia within ourselves must also descend into the Chaos. The sexual force, the creative energy, the Holy Spirit, must fecundate the chaotic waters, the sacred sperm, in order for th e Solar Human to emerge, here and now. Sophia must descend to work within the Chaos of our Being, in order for life to emerge. You know this. The lion - faced light - power absorbs the Divine Wisdom. When Sophia, as Divine Spirit, is associated with the Chaos, then the Protogonos, the primogenial light emerges. The emanations of Self - willed squeeze the light - powers out of Sophia “But all the material emanations of Self - willed surrounded her, and the great lion - faced light - power devoured all the light - powers i n Sophia and cleaned out her light and devoured it, and her matter was thrust into the chaos; it became a lion - faced ruler in the chaos, of which one half is fire and the other is darkness, -- that is Yaldabaoth, of whom I have spoken unto you many times. W hen this befell, Sophia became very greatly exhausted, and that lion - faced light - power set to work to take away from Sophia all her light - powers, and all the material powers of Self - willed surrounded Sophia at the Same time and pressed her sore.” Sophia, exhausted after having been absorbed, suffers intensely. The material powers of the self - willed intellect surround Sophia and lamentably oppress her. The self - willed intellect of the antichrist, expressing itself everywhere, looks with disregard at Sophia . The intellectual antichrist detests Pistis Sophia. The intellectual antichrist, the living manifestation of the ego, performs false miracles and deceitful prodigies everywhere: Atomic bombs, supersonic airplanes, atomic submarines, teleguided atomic rock ets, travels to the Moon, etc., etc., etc. The hatred of the antichrist towards Sophia is shown through all of these false miracles and marvels. All the people kneel in the presence of the antichrist and say, “Who is like unto the beast?” The lion - faced, f alse intellectual light - power, with his dominion, laughs, usurps the place of Sophia and works in order to take away all of Sophia’s luminous powers.

This occurs while the catastrophe is approaching, which will completely change the physiognomy of the terrestrial crust and will end the human species. The real Wisdom, Sophia, is displaced by the false assumption of knowledge of the scoundrels of the i ntellect. Nevertheless, the antichrist, the self - willed, believes that he possesses Sophia. The true substance of Sophia must be searched for within the Chaos. The glory of Sophia is found within the Chaos. Lux in Tenebris Lucet. The Light shines in the Da rkness. Sophia shines in the Darkness. The Starry Water, the prepared Mercury, the substance obtained in the form of white and brilliant metallic water, is the result of the Hermetic Art. That which was found diffused within the tenebrous, gross and vile m ass of the animal sperm can now shine by means of sexual transmutation. The Light of Sophia always emerges from the sexual Chaos, and this Light shines in the Darkness. Sophia, as a Verb, is Yaldabaoth in complete action. CHAPTER 32 “And Pistis Sophia cr ied out most exceedingly, she cried to the Light of lights which she had seen from the beginning, in which she had had faith, and uttered this repentance, saying thus: Pistis Sophia cries to the Light of lights, and cries out with a great voice.

O Light of lights, in whom I have had faith from the beginning, hearken now then O light, unto my repentance. Save me, O Light , for evil thoughts have entered into me. 2. I gazed, O Light, into the lower parts and saw there a light, thinking: I will go to that region, in order that I may take that light. And I went and found myself in the darkness which is in the chaos below and I could no more speed thence and go to my region, for I was sore pressed by all the emanations of Self - willed, and the lion - faced power took away my light in me. 3. And I cried for help, but my voice hath not reached out of the darkness. And I looked un to the height, that the Light, in which I had faith, might help me. 4.

And when the emanations of Self - willed saw the rulers of the Aeons rejoicing over me, they knew that the rulers of the Aeons would not come to my aid; and those emanations which sore pressed me with violence, took courage, and the light w hich I had not taken from them, they have taken from me. 5. Now, therefore, O Light of Truth, thou knowest that I have done this in my innocence, thinking that the lion - faced light - power belonged to thee; and the sin which I have done is open before thee. 6. Suffer me no more to lack, O Lord, for I have had faith in thy light from the beginning; O Lord, O Light of the powers, suffer me no more to lack my light. 7. For because of thy inducement and for the sake of thy light am I fallen into this oppressio n, and shame hath covered me. 8. And because of the illusion of thy light, I am become a stranger to my brethren, the invisibles, and to the great emanations of Barbelo. 9. This hath befallen me, O Light, because I have been zealous for thy abode; and th e wrath of Self - willed is come upon me of him who had not hearkened unto thy command to emanate from the emanation of his power - because I was in his aeon without performing his mystery. 10. And all the rulers of the Aeons mocked me. 11. And I was in tha t region, mourning and seeking after the light, which I had seen in the height. 12. And the guards of the gates of the Aeons searched for me, and all who remain in their mystery mocked me. 13. But looked up unto the height towards thee and had faith in t hee. Now, therefore, O Light of lights, I am sore pressed in the darkness of chaos. If now thou wilt come to save me, -- great is thy mercy, -- then hear me in truth and save me. 14.

Let not this darkness submerge me, and let not this lion - faced power entirely devour the whole of my power, and let not this chaos shroud my power. 16.

My power lo oked forth from the midst of the chaos and from the midst of the darkness, and I waited for my pair, that he should come and fight for me, and he came not, and I looked that he should come and lend me power, and I found him not. 21.

Because of this in which they have set me, let them not ascend to the thirteenth ae on, the region of Justice. 28.

The Self - willed and the lion - faced power absorbed the reflections of Sophia. Sophia has found herself within the obscurity. Sophia asks for help from the Darkness. Sophia suffers inexpressibly in the Darkness. Th e Rulers of the Aeons show resentment towards Sophia when she changes places. Sophia travels wherever she pleases. She can stay in the Thirteenth Aeon or in the Chaos. In essence, Sophia, the Wisdom, is a concrete result of a symbiosis of the mixture of Li ght with Darkness. The descent of the Logos into matter is made dialectically comprehensible by means of the Cosmic Drama. The immersion of the Spirit into matter is dialectically explainable with the life, passion, death and resurrection of Christ within ourselves. Sophia is the result of the descent of the Logos into the Chaos. The lion - faced light - power, which is the triple inferior power: mind, desire and sexual degeneration, have nothing to do with That which is beyond the body, affections and the mind ; That is the Truth. The great emanations of Barbelo, the abode of the Light, can never be comprehended by the intellectual light. The Uncreated Light is distinct from the intellect, as water is from oil. When the Initiate lets himself fall he then cannot enjoy the emanations of Barbelo. There are those who being jealous of the abode of Barbelo fall into the Darkness, where the cries and gnashing of teeth are heard. The self - willed ego never obeys, and it always emanates from itself that which should never be emanated. The Rulers of the Aeons mock the intellectualism that is blindly confused with Sophia. In the inferior regions, the Initiate is lamenting and is searching for the Light that he has seen in the heights."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 77 The Guards of the gates of the Aeons wan t to grant the Initiate the right to pass, but when they see him very much alive, they realize that he is not yet prepared. Sophia is found in the sexual Chaos, in the brute Azoth. We must liberate Sophia from within the darkness of the Chaos. This is poss ible by transmuting the sacred sperm into creative energy. There exist two Chaos, the one from the Macrocosm and the one from the Microcosm. The Chaos of the Microcosm is found in our sexual organs. In the Chaos of Creation, the elements and the principles , the Darkness and the Light, are found confused, intermixed, and without the possibility of one reacting over the other. This is the reason why the Chaos in the figure of the world, which contains in itself the materials of our Hermetic Globe, has been pa inted by many artists. The Cosmos comes from the Chaos, and the Light from the Darkness. In no way can the Cosmos and the Light emerge in the Macrocosm or in the Microcosm without the help of Pistis Sophia. However, Sophia wants to ascend up to the Thirtee nth Aeon. The subjective reasoning within the intellectual animal is a type of chaos where disorder reigns. Obviously, the chaotic disorder of the subjective reasoning also overtakes Sophia, and totally alters her. However, it is not convenient to confuse the authentic, venerable Chaos of sex with these types of intellectual and emotional chaos of the tricerebral biped, mistakenly called human being. Sophia aspires to reach the Thirteenth Aeon. Sophia does not want to be in the Darkness. Sophia waits for th e Grace of the Uncreated Light to come and give her help. Sophia wishes the Light to turn its face towards her because she is suffering in the Chaos. Sophia wishes for the Light to save her luminous powers. The Archons protest for Sophia, they long for her , and at times they see themselves without her. Nevertheless, the Rulers know that Sophia must illuminate the Chaos. What would become of the Rulers, what would become of us if Pistis Sophia would not enter into the Chaos? How could we perform the ‘Great W ork’ without Pistis Sophia? The Chaos also needs Pistis Sophia. The Rulers need Sophia to be in the Chaos, so that they can perform the Great Work within themselves. We had said, and we repeat again, that the Archons are the diverse, autonomous and Self - co nscious parts of our own Being. By itself, the Essence within each one of us could never perform all of the ‘Great Work.’ It is necessary for the Rulers, which means the diverse, Self - conscious and independent parts of our own Being, to work intensely in t he Great Work. Only thus, when all the parts of the Being are working, can we reach the intimate Self - realization. The superior part of the Being must intensely help man, because if He (the superior part of the Being) does not help him, man fails, and if m an fails, the superior part or the superior parts also fail."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 78 The Initiate illuminated by Sophia looks towards the Height. He observes from the Chaos, and from the midst of the obscurity he awaits with infinite longing for his pair, for his Walkiria, for hi s Spiritual Soul. However, he suffers because she has not yet arrived. The Walkiria, the beautiful Helen, the Buddhi, is like a fine and transparent glass of alabaster through which the Flame of Pragna burns. To integrate oneself with the Walkiria, to be c ompletely betrothed with the beautiful Helen, is only possible by means of Resurrection. Unquestionably, all the Christic principles are found contained within Buddhi. When the Causal Man is integrated with Buddhi, he becomes resurrected. Man, in his total ity, becomes illuminated with this whole integration. But, how difficult it is to obtain such an integration. In no way is such integration possible without the previous elimination of the psychic aggregates that we carry within our interior. The Causal Ma n is the true man, and the beautiful Helen is his real wife. The mental and astral bodies, and the physical vehicle with its vital base are his only vestures. Doctor John Faust, physician, enchanter and magician, was married with his pair, in other words, with the beautiful Helen of Troy. One time, John Faust made the beautiful Helen visible and tangible before a group of young students that were left in astonishment before such beauty. The Initiate, inebriated by Sophia, searches for Light, yet he receives Darkness. He wants power, yet he receives matter. The Rulers punish him for his own good. Nevertheless, the Archons also suffer from the effects of Karma. The Rulers working in the Chaos suffer inexpressibly. They want to ascend and cry. It is obviously n ecessary to work in the Chaos in order to have the right to rise towards the Light. Every ascent is preceded by a descent, and every exaltation is anteceded by a terrible and frightful humiliation. The Self - willed god, the terrestrial man with the animal e go within, is always impious and perverse. Sophia does not wish for the Self - willed god to receive the advent of the Rulers. Sophia does not wish for the radiation of the ego to affect the Archons. Sophia knows very well what the ego is capable of. The Sel f - willed always feels that he, is a of all. The ego feels as though he has authority over Pistis Sophia. The Self - willed ego thinks that all that happens to Pistis Sophia is by its power, and by its authority. The Self - willed is the triple inferior power d ominated by the ego. The ego in itself, is plural. It is a sum of multiple, psychic inhuman aggregates, which are living personifications of the psychological defects that we carry within our interior. Pistis Sophia descends into the Chaos, by the command of the Father of all Lights, and by the command of the Self - willed.

Obviously, the mere intellective functionalism cannot purify anyone. Before anything, it is necessary to pass through great emotional crises. If the water does not boil at one hundred degrees, that which must be disintegrated does not disintegra te, and that which must be crystallized does not crystallize. The disintegration of any psychic aggregate is possible only based on conscious works and voluntary sufferings. The Mysteries of the Light are possible only for those who have disintegrated with in themselves the undesirable psychic elements that we carry within our interior. Sophia, deprived of her Light, is the intellectualism of the Self - willed ego, the antichrist. Sophia sings praises to the Verb of the Light. The Light purifies those who trul y are repented of their errors. Each time that an undesirable psychic element is disintegrated within ourselves, a luminous power crystallizes in our personality. This is how the luminous Soul is crystallizing within ourselves. May the power of the Stars p erpetuate in each Initiate. This is our greatest longing. The luminous Beings and the luminous Being within ourselves want to purify us. Purification is possible only by disintegrating the undesirable elements of our psyche. The disintegration of the undes irable elements of the psyche is never possible without the direct help of Stella Mans. Stella Mans is the Virgin of the Sea, the Igneous Serpent of our magical powers. Stella Mans is a variation of our own Being. Stella Mans is our own Being, but a deriva tive. The Light wants to purify all the Beings and persons. The Light hears the prayer of all the Beings and persons. May the people and the Souls praise the Lord of all Aeons, the Cosmic Common Eternal Father. This is our longing. God will liberate the so ul of all matter, and the city of Heliopolis will open its gates, in order for the perfect ones to enter through them. They will abide in that city, and they will inherit it. That is the new Jerusalem from “The Apocalypse” of St. John. The Initiates will a bide in the city of Heliopolis, in the luminous regions of the Great Light. Nevertheless, it is necessary to note that only those who have completed the Great Work can reside in the city of Heliopolis.

Now, therefore: ‘Who hath ears to hear, let him h ear.’ Mary again came forward and said: “My Lord, my indweller of light hath ears, and I hear with my light - power, and thy spirit which is with me, hath sobered me. Hearken then that I may speak concerning the repentance, which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, speaking of her sin and all that befell her. Thy light - power hath prophesied thereof aforetime through the prophet David in the sixty - eighth Psalm. Those who have repented of their sins sing to the Great Light. Marah, Mary, Isis, the Virgin of the Sea, wi thin ourselves, hears the power of the Light, and the Spirit of the Lord dwells within Her. God is rising within ourselves when our Divine Mother Kundalini disintegrates and scatters the ashes of the enemies of the Eternal One. Unquestionably, the enemies of God are the undesirable psychic elements that we carry within our interior, Such elements personify our psychological defects: Anger, greed, lust, envy, pride, laziness, gluttony, etc., etc., etc. Just as the wax melts in front of the fire, the impious ones will perish in front of our profound interior God. But the just ones, which means those who have completed the Great Work, will be joyful and will rejoice, and they will leap with pleasure in the presence of the Intimate God. Sing to your profound int imate God. Sing psalms to his Name. Exalt in He who rides over all the superior levels of the Being. Jah is his name. Jah is the mantra through which the Ancient of Days is invoked. Each one of us has his own Ancient. He is the superior part of the Being. “Father of Orphans and defender of widows” is God in His holy abode. “To the orphans, God gives a family to reside with, and to the captives, He gives freedom and prosperity. Yet, the rebel ones will abide on dry land.” Mary interpreteth the first repenta nce from Psalm LXVIII 1. Save me, O God, for the waters are come in even unto my soul. 2. I sank, or am submerged, in the slime of the abyss, and powers was not. I have gone down into the depths of the sea; a tempest hath submerged me. 3. I have kept on crying; my throat is gone, my eyes faded, waiting patiently for God. 4. They who hate me without a cause are more than the ‘hairs of my head; mighty are my foes, who violently pursued me. They required of me that which I took not from them. 5.

Marah, Isis, Ad onia, the Igneous Serpent of our magical powers, the ‘Woman Serpent’, tremendously suffers within our own selves. Isis always suffers for Her Child in ourselves, and within our own selves, here and now. Each one of us makes his Divine Mother Kundalini suff er tremendously. People spill Hermes’ glass, thus, they perish within the waters of life. Moses was saved from the waters. Yet, the multitudes do not want to be saved from the waters. Truly, only those who never spill Hermes’ glass can be saved from the wa ters. When submerged in the slime, Marah, Mary suffers inexpressibly. Evil children make their Mother suffer. The lustful current of the evil child sinks his Mother into the profundities of the ocean of pain. The psychic aggregates mortally hate the Divine Mother Kundalini The tenebrous ones violently attack all those who name the Divine Mother Kundalini within the castle of Klingsor, and in all the temples of black magic"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 83 The Divine Mother Kundalini suffers inexpressibly for Her child. She fights to disinte grate the undesirable psychic elements, and She answers for Her child, feeling herself one with Her child. The divine Woman - Serpent feels shame for the sins of Her child. It is tremendous how we make our Mother Kundalini suffer. The Initiate, fallen in the slime, suffers inexpressibly, and the injuries hurt his heart. Those who have lost their Soul and have recovered it suffer when they see their errors. We must repent of our errors The Initiate must remain impassible before praise and calumny. Truly, we ar e not more because they praise us, neither are we less because they condemn us, because we are always what we are Salvation within the Truth is radical. “Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free” said Christ. The Initiate works with the he lp of the Divine Mother Kundalini, illuminated by Sophia. Yet, when in pain, he asks his Father to take him out of the slime. To be saved from the waters, as was Moses, is extraordinary. The waters of life, the ‘Ens Seminis’, are accustomed to being boiste rous Rare are those who obtain real salvation. Almost the human beings fall into the well. They are swallowed by the Profundity. The Great Merciful One can save us, but only if we work on ourselves. The Lord shows His face to the serf that works on himself . Only the Intimate Christ can save us. The enemies of ourselves are within our own selves. The secret enemies dwell within our own psyche. They are the subjective aggregates, which are living personifications of our psychological defects. The psychic aggr egates make us abnormal creatures. The psyche of the humanoids of the Earth is very strange. It is subjective, incoherent and abnormal. Obviously, the psyche which is bottled up within the psychic aggregates is abnormally processed. As long as the animal e go continues to thrive within ourselves we will have gall for our meat. While the Initiate continues with the undesirable elements of the ‘myself inside of the psyche, he will have vinegar to drink in order to calm his thirst, and the pain will multiply un til the infinite. May bitterness be for the psychic aggregates. The psychic aggregates are really those who must distil and drink their own poison. The indignation of the Being must be against them, against the undesirable elements that we carry within. Ma y the Essence be free and may the tenebrous ones perish. Those perverse ones that we carry within our interior always add iniquity to their iniquities. The psychic aggregates must be disintegrated and erased from the book of the living. The Initiate feels as though he is a poor, unfortunate one, with a broken heart. Yet, the salvation of the profound Intimate Being raises him, stimulates him, and keeps him straight on the real Path."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 84 It is necessary to praise the profound name of the Intimate Lord in the ode , and exalt it in the song of thanksgiving. God hears the suffering soul and never despises the prisoners, which means, those who are paying Karma. The four elements, fire, water; air and earth are found contained within the Mercury of the Wise. This is ho w the Wise can govern the elements of Nature. The Super - Man governs the elements of Nature. The Celestial Jerusalem shines within the resurrected Adept. The Celestial Jerusalem is in the seed of the serfs of the Lord. The ancient populace worshipped the co rn, wheat and rice, because they represent the sacred seed. Mayas and Nahoas symbolized the Mercury of the Wise with corn. The Middle East and Europe saw the blessed seed in the wheat. China, Japan and India saw the sacred sperm in the rice. We transform t he Ens Seminis into creative energy, which means into Mercury, only by the transmutatory science. Whosoever possesses the Mercury of the Wise can create within himself the superior existential bodies of the Being. Whosoever possesses the Mercury of the Wis e within himself will abide in the city of Heliopolis. God will save Zion by virtue of the Mercury of the Wise. The interior cities will be constructed, and the Initiates will dwell in them and inherit them. A City of Light, a Celestial Jerusalem, must be constructed within each human being. This is how Initiates can abide in the city of Heliopolis. Thus, within each human being, a terribly malignant psychological city exists, which is inhabited by the demons of desire. We must destroy this city. It is nece ssary to create the Mercury of the Wise in order to edify the Celestial Jerusalem within ourselves. It is written, “The seed of his servants shall possess it, and they who love his name shall dwell therein.” “Know Thyself.” You, who wish to know the Philos ophical Stone, must know yourself very well. Thus, you will know it. The key of the Philosophical Stone is within the Mercury of the Wise. The elements of Nature are joined in their precise proportion and in their natural quality within the Mercury, which is the Metallic Soul of the sacred sperm. All of that which is searched for by the Wise is what comes from the Mercury. Only the Mercury has the power to dissolve, mortify, and destroy the undesirable psychic elements that we carry within our interior. Ele ments transform themselves into other elements within the Mercury. The element earth within each one of us will convert itself into water, and the water into air. Finally, the air will convert itself into fire. Thus, the Mercury fecundated by Sulphur (Fire ), by way of the good duties of the sublimed Salt, will rise through the medullar canal of the aspirant, in order to radically transform him. Light shines within Darkness."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 85 Stella Mans, the Virgin of the Sea, Devi Kundalini shines in the Mercury that ascend s through the medullar canal of the Initiate. The Igneous Serpent of our magical powers reduces all the tenebrous dwellers of the psychological city into dust. The Celestial Jerusalem will be raised upon the ruins of the damned city. Therefore, the Celesti al Jerusalem is something profoundly internal. It is our own interior Universe. CHAPTER 34 It came to pass then, when Mary had finished speaking these words unto Jesus in the midst of the disciples, that she said unto him... “My Lord, this is the solutio n of the mystery of the repentance of Pistis Sophia.” It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard Mary speak these words, that he said unto her: “Well said, Mary, blessed one, the fullness, or all - blessed fullness, thou who shall be sung of as blessed in al l generation.” Mary, Marah, Tonantzin, Isis, Adonia, Diana, Rhea, Insobertha, etc., is as we have previously stated, a part of our own Being, but a derivative. Unquestionably, Marah, Mary, is the Igneous Serpent of our magical powers. Therefore, Mary is t he blessed one, the Divine Mother Kundalini. The repentance of Sophia within the Initiate and the Mystery of such repentance resides within the sexual transmutatory science. It is indispensable to build the Celestial Jerusalem upon the Stone of Truth. Obvi ously, the cubic stone of Yesod is the foundation of the city of Heliopolis. Undoubtedly, Yesod - Mercury is found within sex. Yesod signifies Foundation and also Mercury, because the Mercury is the foundation of the transmutatory art. Those who reject the c ubic stone of Yesod fall into the abyss of perdition. Peter, the great Hierophant of the sexual mysteries said, “...Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on Him shall not be confounded. “...The stone that the bu ilders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner.” (Peter: 2: 6 - 8). This stone is sex, which is “... a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence.” The ignorant ones reject the mysteries of sex. Thus, frightfully they fail. Those who spill Hermes’ Glass sink into the exterior Darkness, where only the weeping and gnashing of teeth are heard. CHAPTER 35 The second repentance of Sophia. Jesus continued again in the discourse and said: “Pistis Sophia again continued and still sang praises in a second repentance, saying thus: 1. Light of lights, in whom I have had faith, leave me not in the darkness until the end of my time."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 86 2. Help me and save me through thy mysteries; incline thine ear unto me and save me. 3. May the power of thy light save me and carry me to the higher Aeons, for thou wilt save me and lead me into the height of thy Aeons 4. Save me, O Light, from the hand of this lion - faced power and from the hands of the emanations of god Self willed. 5. For it is thou, O Light, in whose light I have had faith and in whose light I have trusted from the beginning. 6. And I have had faith in it from the time when it emanated me, and thou thyself didst make me to emanate; and I have had faith in thy light from the beginning. 7. And when I had fait h in thee, the rulers of the Aeons mocked at me, saying: She hath ceased in her mystery. Thou art my saviour and thou art my deliverer and thou art my mystery, O Light. 8. My mouth was filled with glorifying, that I may tell of the mystery of thy grandeur at all times. 9. Now, therefore, O Light, leave me not in the chaos for the completion of my whole time; forsake me not, O Light. 10. For all the emanations of self willed have taken from me my whole light - power and have surrounded me. They desired to t ake away my whole light from me utterly and have set a watch on my power. 11. Saying one to another together: The Light has forsaken her, let us seize her and take away the whole light in her. 12. Therefore, then, O Light, cease not from me; turn thee, O Light, and save me from the hands of the merciless. 13. May they who would take away my power, fall down and become powerless. May they who would take away my light - power from me, be enwrapped in darkness and sink into powerlessness. “This then is the s econd repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, singing praises to the Light.” The Father who is in secret is the Father of all Lights, and the Initiate is traveling towards Him. The Ancient of Days is the Supreme Lord of all Mysteries. Each one of us has his own Kabbalistic Ancient. The Ancient of Days in us can and must save us through His Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 87 The Father of all Lights, the Ancient of Centuries within us, the superior part of the Being, can save us and take us to the highest Aeons. The Self - will ed god, the animal ego, must be reduced to cosmic dust. The Ancient of the Light is the Concealed of the concealed, the Goodness of goodness, the Mercy of mercies. We originally emanated from the Father who is in secret; you know this. Essentially speaking , we as human beings, as souls, are the result of the various sunderable divisions of the Ancient of Centuries. The Rulers of the Aeons within us mock the fallen Boddhisattwa, saying, “you have ceased in your mystery; you are a pig that is wallowing in the mud of the Earth.” The Boddhisattwa is a germ from any sacred individual, who is placed within the sacred sperm with the possibilities of development that is all. Undoubtedly, if such a germ could not become developed, reincarnation would then be a failur e. Fallen Boddhisattwas are always true failures. The Ancient of Days is the Saviour. He is the Redeemer. He is the Mystery of Mysteries. The Intimate Christ emanates from the Ancient of Days, and through Him the Father saves us. The Son is one with the Fa ther, and the Father is one with the Son. Whosoever has seen the Son, has seen the Father. The Mystery of the magnificence of the Father of all Lights is the Mystery of all Mysteries. The Light buds from the Chaos. Each one of us carries the Chaos in our o wn self and within our own self. Alchemically, the Chaos is the seed plot of the Cosmos. The Alchemical Chaos is found within the actual creative organs. Sophia does not wish to be left exclusively in the Chaos. She wants to ascend to the Thirteenth Aeon. Every Initiate who longs to ascend towards the Thirteenth Aeon is helped in his or her ascension by the Ancient of Days. The ego, the Self - willed hates Pistis Sophia. Thus, by submerging her into Chaos and into desperation the Self - willed defeats her. The emanations of the Self - willed are the psychic aggregates that we carry within our interior. In reality, all of those multiple aggregates are stealing the Light. Within each psychic aggregate, there is a certain percentage of imprisoned Light. Obviously, we are referring to a certain percentage of Essence, of Consciousness, which is trapped and bottled up. Each time that we attain the disintegration of a psychic aggregate, we liberate the corresponding percentage of Essence, of Consciousness, which is bottle d up there. This is how we can increase, little by little, the percentage of real Consciousness within ourselves. Normally, humanity possesses three percent of free Consciousness. If humanity had ten percent of Consciousness, then wars would not exist. Dur ing the Nineteenth Century and part of the Twentieth Century, the various Adepts who sacrificed themselves for humanity enjoy fifty percent of awakened Consciousness."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 88 Only the Resurrected Adepts possess one hundred percent of awakened Consciousness. The ps ychic aggregates multiply themselves within the intellectual animal. Thus, logically speaking, they steal the Light from him. Each psychic aggregate has stolen a certain percentage of our Consciousness. Only the Light can save us from the hands of those me rciless ones, whom we carry within our interior. May those who steal the power fall and be reduced to cosmic dust. This is the second repentance that Sophia sang to the Ancient of Days, to the Father who is in Secret. The Initiate, filled with Pistis Sophi a, sings and beseeches to the Father of all Lights. CHAPTER 36 Peter complaineth of Mary It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his disciples, that he said unto them; “Do ye understand in what manner I discourse with you ?” And Peter started forward and said unto Jesus: “My Lord, we will not endure this woman, for she taketh the opportunity from us and hath let none of us speak, but she discourseth many times.” And Jesus answered and said unto his disciples: “Let him in wh om the power of his spirit shall seeth, so that he understandeth what I say, come forward and speak. But now, Peter, I see thy power in thee, that it understandeth the solution of the mystery of the repentance, which Pistis Sophia hath uttered. Now, theref ore, Peter, speak the thought of her repentance in the midst of thy brethren.” Peter, the Hierophant of sexual mysteries speaks with great wisdom. We must know how to listen to him. We have previously stated that the twelve Powers are within ourselves. Pr eviously, we emphatically affirmed that the twelve Powers are the twelve parts of our own Being. We formerly explained that the twelve autonomous and Self - conscious parts of our own Being are the twelve Apostles of the Cosmic Drama within ourselves, here a nd now. Therefore, we must comprehend that Peter, within ourselves, is that Self - conscious part of our profound interior Being, related with the mysteries of sex. Peter’s death, crucified on the inverted cross, with his head towards the ground, indicates t he necessity for us to descend into the Ninth Sphere, sex, in order to work with the fire and water. All White Initiations begin here. Peter makes us understand that the Woman - Serpent discourses many times. Nevertheless, Peter and the Woman - Serpent within ourselves are found intimately related. The Woman - Serpent, Stella Mans, must interrogate Her son, Christ, many times during the Great Work in order to help us. The Woman - Serpent is the Wife of the Holy Spirit and the Daughter of Her Son. The Woman - Serpent is Marah, Mary, Isis, our Divine Mother Kundalini."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 89 The Intimate Christ knows very well that the interior Peter of each one of us integrally comprehends the solution of the repentance that Pistis Sophia uttered. Peter, Patar, with his radical letters, knows very well that the key of repentance is in sex. The three radical letters of Peter, Patar, are ‘P - T - R’. Only the power of the Spirit can comprehend the words of the Intimate Christ. It is necessary to receive the ‘Donum - Dei’ in order to comprehend all the science of the Great Work. The true Repentance has its foundation in the sexual Mysteries. Peter is the one who has to express the idea of repentance in the midst of his brethren. The brethren of Peter are the autonomous and Self - conscious parts of our ow n individual Being. Peter interpreteth the second repentance of Psalm LXX And Peter answered and said unto Jesus: “O Lord, give ear that I may speak the thought of her repentance, of which aforetime thy power prophesied through the prophet David, utterin g her repentance in the seventieth Psalm: 1. O God, my God, I have trusted in thee, let me no more be put to shame forever. 2. Save me in thy virtuousness and set me free; incline thine ear unto me and save me. 3. Be unto me a strong God and a firm plac e to save me; for thou art my strength and my refuge. 4.

I have become as the crazy for many; thou art my help and my strength, thou art my deliverer, O Lord. 8. My mouth was filled with glorifying, that I might praise the glory of thy splendour the whole daylong. 9. Cast me not away in the time of age; if my soul fades, forsake me not. 10.

God, give heed to my help. 13. Let them be ashamed and destroyed who calumniate my soul Let them be enwrapped in shame and disgrace who seek evil against me.” “This then is the solution of the second repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered.” The interior God of each one of us is what counts. Only our interior God can save us from all disgrace. The interior Lord, the superior part of the Being, hears us and helps us. May the severity of our God save us. May the mercy of our God protect us. The Lord will save us from the hand of the transgressor, from the hand of the sinner, and from the impious one. The transgressor, the sinner, and t he impious ones are within ourselves. Verily, the transgressors, the sinners, and the impious ones are the psychic aggregates that we carry within our interior. The Intimate God is our resistance and our hope, our strength and our reality. Whosoever has in carnated the Intimate Christ knows very well that he has come from the womb of his Divine Mother Kundalini. We came from the womb of the Mother by the will of the Ancient of Centuries. We must never forget our Father, who is in secret. Each one of us has h is own Father. For the intellectual animal, mistakenly called human being, anything related with the Spirit is mere craziness We must praise the Father, who is in secret The Soul often fades, but if the Father fortifies us, we will be victorious. When the child falls, when he perverts himself, then the Father withdraws. When the Father withdraws, the child falls into disgrace. If the Father would not withdraw, then the child would not fall into disgrace. Whosoever is assisted by his or her Father never fall s into misery Miserable is the wicked child who has his Father absent. It would have been better for that child to have not been born, or it would have been better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. The Ancient of Centuries can give us all, or He can withdraw from us, if this is His will. Woe to the one who is withdrawn from the Ancient of Days. The enemies of the night, the red demons of Seth, the living personifications of our psychologica l defects, have spoken evil against the Being. Verily, verily, beloved reader, the red demons of Seth, your psychic aggregates, are waiting for your Soul. A certain percentage of psychic Essence exists within each aggregate.

CHAPTER 37 Jesus promiseth to perfect the disciples in all things The saviour answered and said unto Peter: Finally, Peter; this is the solution of her repentance. Blessed are ye before all men on the earth, because I have revealed u nto you these mysteries. Amen, Amen, I say unto you: I will perfect you in all fullness from the mysteries of the interior to the mysteries of the exterior and fill you with the spirit, so that ye shall be called “spiritual, perfected in all fullness.” And , amen, amen, I say unto you I will give unto you all the mysteries of all the regions of my Father and of all the regions of the First Mystery, so that he whom ye shall admit on earth, shall be admitted into the Light of the height; and he whom he ye shal l expel on earth, shall be expelled from the kingdom of my Father in the heaven. But hearken, therefore, and give ear attentively to all the repentance, which Pistis Sophia hath uttered. She continued again and uttered the third repentance, saying: The In timate Christ always instructs Peter. The Intimate Christ reveals the Mysteries to Peter. The Intimate Christ has the power in order to perfect Peter in his entire splendor. The Lord gives all the Mysteries of all the regions of the Father and all the regi ons of the First Mystery to the interior Peter within each one of us. Consequently, the secret Peter of each one of us is interesting. He, who Peter admits on earth, shall be admitted into the Light of the height, and he who Peter expels on earth, shall be expelled from the Kingdom of the Father in Heaven. It is clear that Peter is the Hierophant of sex within ourselves. Therefore, he has the power to open or to close the doors of Heaven in ourselves, and within ourselves. Verily, verily, I say unto you tha t Peter has the keys of the Kingdom. The secret power that opens or closes the doors of Eden is in sex. The sexual energy, when correctly orientated, opens the doors of Paradise. The creative energy, when incorrectly orientated, closes the doors of Paradis e. Sulphur and Mercury are the two keys of the Kingdom. These two keys, one of Gold and the other of Silver, form a Cross in the hands of Peter. The third repentance of Sophia 1. O Light of powers, give heed and save me. 2. May they who would take away my light, lack and be in the darkness. May they who would take away my power, turn into chaos and be put to shame.

Save me then now, O Light, for I lacked my light, which they have taken away, and I needed my power, which they have taken from me. Thou then, O Light, thou art my Saviour, and thou art my deliverer, O Light. Save me quickly out of this chaos. The Father of all Lights attends us and saves us. The tenebrous ones steal the Light from us. This Light is found bottled up within the tenebrous ones, who are the living p ersonifications of our psychological defects. The tenebrous ones believe themselves to be lords of Sophia. The diverse parts of the Being search for the Light, and wish for the Mystery of Sophia. They wish for Sophia to be exalted. Only the Light can take Sophia away from the Chaos. The Ancient of Days can save Sophia and conduce her from the Darkness to the Light, by means of His Son, the Intimate Christ, the Redeemer. The Saviour can save Sophia. He takes her from the Chaos, and carries her to the Thirtee nth Aeon. CHAPTER 38 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his disciples, saying: “This is the third repentance of Pistis Sophia,” that he said unto them. “Let him in whom a sensitive spirit hath arisen, come forward and speak the thought of the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered.” The third repentance of Pistis Sophia is sublime. When the sensitive Spirit arises in ourselves, then we can speak of the third repentance of Pistis Sophia. Martha asketh and receivet h permission to speak It came to pass then, before Jesus had finished speaking, that Martha came forward, fell down at his feet, kissed them, cried aloud and wept with lamentation and in humbleness, saying: “My Lord, have mercy upon me and have compassion with me, and let me speak the solution of the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered.” And Jesus gave his hand unto Martha and said unto her: “Blessed is every one who humbleth himself for on him they shall have mercy. Now, therefore, Martha, art tho u blessed. But proclaim then the solution of the thought of the repentance of Pistis Sophia.” "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 93 Martha, within ourselves, is that part of our Being who represents the virtue of humbleness. Three types of relations are indispensable. First, the relation w ith our own body, second, the relation with the environment and third, the relation with our own Self If we do not know how to relate with our body wisely, then we become ill. If we do not know how to relate with the environment, which surrounds us, then w e create many conflicts for ourselves. If we do not know how to correctly relate ourselves with the distinct parts of the Being, then the true Illumination is more than impossible. The proud, the conceited, and the vain ones, can never wisely relate with t he superior part of the Being. Only Martha, humbleness, can proclaim the solution of the repentance of Sophia. Martha interpreteth the third repentance from Psalm LXIX And Martha answered arid said unto Jesus in the midst of the disciples: “Concerning th e repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, O my Lord Jesus, of it thy light - power in David prophesied aforetime in the sixty - ninth Psalm, saying: 1. O Lord God, give heed to my help. 2. Let them be put to shame and confounded who seek after my soul. 3. May they turn straightway and be put to shame, who say unto me: Ha, ha. 4. May all who seek thee, be joyful and exult because of thee, and they who love thy salvation, say ever, May God be exalted. 5. But I am wretched, I am poor; O Lord, help me. Th ou art my helper and defense; O Lord, delay not.’ “This then is the solution of the third repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, singing praises to the height.” If He would not help us, we would surely fail, and if we fail, He also fails. Those who pursue the Soul must be put to shame. The ensemble of inhuman elements that we carry within our interior are precisely the pursuers of the Soul. The red demons of Seth must be put to shame, confounded, and destroyed. Only the diverse parts of the Being sea rch for the Intimate Christ. In reality, we are poor and wretched. Nevertheless, the interior Lord can save us. He will work from the depth of our Soul, truly experiencing all the Cosmic Drama. CHAPTER 39 It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard Martha speak these words, that he said unto her: “Well said, Martha, and finely.”"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 94 And Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: “Pistis Sophia again continued in the fourth repentance, reciting it before she was oppressed a second time, in order that the lion - faced power and all the material emanations with it, which Self - willed had sent into the chaos, might not take away her total light in her. She uttered then this repentance as follows: The lion - faced or bestial - faced power, and its emanations, makes Pistis Sophia suffer. Self - willed, the ego, steals the Light from Pistis Sophia. While the multiple, undesirable elements that personify our psychological defects exist within ourselves, it is ostensible that there will be pain. It is no t possible for happiness to be within each one of us, while the elements of Unhappiness exist in our interior. The Essence, bottled up within all the subjective elements of misfortune, will process itself in virtue of its own embottlement. The subjective e lements of perceptions are precisely the entire variety of inhuman psychic elements that we carry in our interior. The marvelous, integral, unitotal, complete, illuminated perception of the Reality comes when we destroy the subjective elements of perceptio ns. These are the living personification of our errors. Material emanations of the lion - faced or bestial - faced power, and the ego are precisely not only the variety of undesirable psychic elements, but moreover, they are also the personality. Obviously, th e personality must also be annihilated, and reduced to cosmic dust. The personality is never homogeneous. The personality has many heterogeneous, subjective depths. The personality is multiple. Karma is deposited within the personality. The personality is Dry Mercury and Arsenic or poisonous Sulphur. This is known by the workers of the Great Work. The personality interferes between the body and the Being. The personality serves as an obstacle for the Illumination. All subjective interference will conclude w hen the personality and the ego are destroyed, and the Being will resurrect within ourselves in order to express Himself in all His Plenitude. The resurrected Being expresses Himself with wisdom, love, and power. The lion - faced and its emanations, Self - wil led and its perversity torture Pistis Sophia. The fourth repentance of Sophia 1.

Because of the voice of the fear and the power of Self - willed my power is vanished 6. I am become as a demon apart, who dwelleth in matter and light is not in him, and I am become as a counterfeiting spirit, which is in a mat erial body and light - power is not in it. 7. And I am become as a decan who is alone in the air. 8. The emanations of Self - willed have sore oppressed me, and my pair hath said unto himself 9.

Pistis Sophia cries out within the Initiate. She asks the Father of all the Lights for help. The red demons of Seth oppress Pistis Sophia. The Light of Pistis Sophia, identified with the inhuman elements of matter, suff ers immensely. The tenebrous ones have taken the Light and the power from Pistis Sophia. The red demons of Seth, within ourselves, embitter Pistis Sophia. Thus, Sophia forgets the Mystery, which must be accomplished, the great Mystery of the inner Self - rea lization. Fear is the worst enemy of Pistis Sophia. Men kill each other because of fear. Nations arm themselves and go to war because of fear. We mistrust people because of fear. Espionage and perversity exist because of fear. There exist thieves and prost itutes because of the fear of life. The aspirants flee and part from the real Path because of fear. Frontiers, documents and restrictions of all types, which interrupt the journeys of people, are due to fear. Fear is the cause of thousands of personal and collective conflicts. The fallen Initiate, lacking Light, and with Pistis Sophia within his interior, appears like a demon. The fallen aspirant, although he has a physical body, lacks Light and power. A decan, alone in the air, is the Initiate who is falle n in the mud. Pistis Sophia is oppressed by the ego, the Self - willed, and in general by all of its psychic elements, within which the Consciousness of the Initiate is found bottled up. The Soul, wisdom, Pistis Sophia, suffers immensely. Sophia hides the s weetness of her own Essence and the anguish of her eyes within herself, so that the tenebrous ones cannot take the rest of her Light. How bitter the fate of Sophia, the Soul, the Being is after the fall. The Father of all Lights knows how we have suffered, and by His command and in accordance with the Law, we are here. We have broken the Law, and we must suffer the consequences. The human beings, devolving within the Chaos, suffer the inexpressible. Nevertheless. Christ, the Ancient of Days, can save us. Wh en incarnated in the Venustic Initiation, Christ works terrifically from within the Initiate, in order to liberate the fallen Soul, Pistis Sophia. The Intimate Christ, the Son of the Father of all the Lights, must seek Pistis Sophia in order to save her."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 97 T he Adepts of the Great Light also seek Pistis Sophia, who is hidden within the Initiate, in order to help her. By helping, the Redeemers help themselves. Give and you shall be given. The more you give, the more you shall be given, but whosoever gives nothi ng, even that which he has shall be taken away from him. The Rulers of the Aeons fear the Mysteries of the Light. How difficult it is to ascend to the Thirteenth Aeon. The fear of the Rulers in the presence of the Thirteenth Aeon is ostensible. The Initiat e who attains the arrival to the Thirteenth Aeon is very rare. The Intimate Christ will seek the power of your Soul. He will reveal the Great Mysteries to you, so that you can arrive at the Thirteenth Aeon. It is not possible to arrive at the Thirteenth Ae on without previously passing through the Buddhist Annihilation. Whosoever wishes to arrive at the Thirteenth Aeon must previously disintegrate the entire variety of undesirable psychic elements that we carry within our interior. Pistis Sophia, bottled up within the psychic aggregates, is processed in virtue of her own bottled up state. Whosoever wishes to arrive at the Thirteenth Aeon must disintegrate within himself not only the psychic aggregates of evil, but also the psychic aggregates of good. We must pass beyond good and evil. Unquestionably, the Soul can observe the repentance of the inferior parts of itself from the Thirteenth Aeon. The inferior parts of our own Being, placed in the inferior levels, also have the right to repentance. This is Gnosis, the Christie Mystery, and the fundamental Doctrine that will shine gloriously in the future Sixth Great Root Race, following the great catastrophe, which is approaching. The Light will shine above the future Race, in the Golden Age. Gnosis will illuminate the Consciousness and will liberate the oppressed. The Intimate Christ will place His name in the Soul, and the sacred Mystery in the real power. Then, the Solar Dynasties will govern the populations, and the entire Earth will be a paradise. The future Roo t Race will reside in new continents, because the present continents will remain at the bottom of the seas, after being burned by ardent fire. The gigantic planet known as Hercolubus is approaching now. It is a world thousands of times larger than the Eart h. Obviously, when Hercolubus is excessively close to the Earth, it will attract the liquid fire from the interior of the world towards the surface, and then all that which is alive will be burned. A complete revolution of the axis of the Earth will take p lace upon the maximum approach of Hercolubus. The poles will then be converted into the equator, and the equator into the poles.

CHAPTER 40 John as keth and receiveth permission to speak It came to pass while Jesus spoke these words unto his disciples, saying unto them; “This is the fourth repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered; now, therefore, let him who understandeth, understand,” it came to pass then, when Jesus had spoken these words, that John came forward, adored the breast of Jesus and said unto him; “My Lord, give commandment to me also, and grant me to speak the solution of the fourth repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered” Jesus s aid unto John: “I give thee commandment, and I grant thee to speak the solution of the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered...” John answered and said: “My Lord and Saviour, concerning this repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, thy light - power which was in David, hath prophesied aforetime in the one - hundred - and - first Psalm: John, within ourselves, is the Verb, the Word, an autonomous and Self - conscious part of our own Being. The Light - Power which was in David, which means the Christ - power which was in David, prophesied centuries ago through the one - hundred - and - first Psalm. Christ, the Intimate Christ was also in David and within David. Unquestionably, the Intimate Christ is the Instructor of the world. Each one of the serfs of the Lord sigh for their Philosophical Stone, and they feel pity for the multitudes. A psychological country exists within each one of us, which is populated by all of the psychic aggregates which we carry within our interior. The people know the place in which they are situ ated at each given moment; yet, they disgracefully ignore the psychological place in which they are situated. There are those who live situated in brothels and taverns, or in filthy places of their psychological countries, and they lamentably ignore it. Ev en though it seems incredible, the fact is that there is some very worthy and virtuous spouses who live within their homes in the physical world, yet psychologically, they are found situated in brothels. Honest and decent gentlemen with magnificent records are found psychologically situated in suburbs, towns, and streets of gangsters, thieves, and bandits. All of this is due to those psychic aggregates, which we carry in our interior. By disintegrating such psychic aggregates, living personifications of our psychological defects, we will firmly establish ourselves in the heaven of our psychological country, which means, in the superior levels of our own Being, here and now."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 99 By disintegrating the psychic aggregates is how we will make a masterwork of our own life. The psychological country of each one of us fears the Name of the Lord, and the Kings of the Earth.

The red demons of Seth k now very well that the sovereignty of the Lord signifies their death. The Lord will build Zion, which means, our interior Universe, the existential Superior bodies of the Being, and He will also reveal Himself in His sovereignty. The Lord never despises th e prayer of the humble one. All of this will be understood by the future generation.

The luminous and spermatic Fiat of the First Inst ant gave life to all that which is, has been, and will be. Nevertheless, the emanations of the ego oppress Pistis Sophia. The emanations of the Self - willed again squeeze the light out of Sophia And Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto hi s disciples: “It came to pass again thus: The emanations of Self - willed again oppressed Pistis Sophia in the chaos and desired to take from her whole light; and not yet was her commandment accomplished, to lead her out of the chaos, and not yet had the com mand reached me through the First Mystery, to save her out of the chaos.

Pistis Sophia sings praises to the Light of salvation, as much as in the Chaos, as in the Heights. The Initiate of Pistis Sophia fulfils with the Table of Hermes Trismegistus, which literally states the following: “It is true, no lie, certain, and to be depended upon, the superior agrees with the inferior, an d the inferior with the superior, to affect One Truly Wonderful Work. “As all things owe their existence to the will of the Only One, so all things owe their origin to the One Only Thing, the most hidden, by the arrangement of the Only God."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 103 “The Father of that One Only Thing is the Sun, its Mother is the Moon, the Wind carried it in its belly; but its Nourse is a Spirituous Earth.

Its power is perfect, after it had been united to Spirituous Ea rth. “Separate that Spirituous Earth from the dense or crude by means of gentle heat, with much attention. “In great measure it ascends from the Earth up to Heaven, and descends again, newborn, on the Earth, and the superior and the inferior are increased in power. “By this thou wilt partake of the honors of the whole world. And darkness will fly from thee. “This is the strength of all powers. With this thou wilt be able to overcome all things, and to transmute all what is fine and what is coarse. “In this manner the World was created; the arrangements to follow this road are Hidden. For this reason I am called Hermes Trismegistus, One in Essence, but Three in Aspect, in this Trinity is hidden tile Wisdom of the whole World. “It is completed now, what I have said concerning the effects of the Sun.” The initiate suffers immensely in the Chaos below, within the darknesses of the No - Being. The darkness, which is below, is frightful. The Rulers, who are below, within the darknesses of the No - Being, know how Pist is Sophia suffers. Many are the matters which axe absolutely condemned within ourselves - . The Adept, charged with Pistis Sophia, ascends and descends when it is necessary. At times, the Initiate must remain in the abyss for a lengthy period of time, workin g in the super - obscurity and in the august silence of the Wise. Light emerges from Darkness, and the Cosmos emerges from the Chaos. The Wise, within the Darkness below, live within the matters, which are dead and lacking of power. However, such matters bel ieve themselves to be alive and powerful. I am emphatically referring to the demons of the Averno. The Intimate Christ has performed his command in the heart of the Adepts who descend into the tenebrous kingdom of Pluto, in order to Work in the Great Work . When the Adepts descend into the Tartarus, they remove themselves from the Intimate Christ, and they suffer inexpressibly. Pistis Sophia cried for the Light when she found herself in the Averno. The Light always fulfils its command in the Chaos. The Deli verers are the superior parts of the Being who visit the Adept in the Averno in order to instruct him. Obviously, each ascent is anteceded by a descent, and every mystic exaltation is preceded by a frightful and terrible humiliation. No one can ascend, wit hout previously having taken the trouble to descend. The Mystery of the secret Name of each one of us is terribly divine. Abominable matters, which are at times heroic and bountiful with many merits, exist within ourselves. Yet, they can never purify thems elves.

May the power of the Light reach into the Chaos for the good of the Wise, who work within the august, super - obscurity of the great Mysteries. May the terrors of the Abyss not confuse the Wise. This is our longing. The terro rs of the infernal worlds, within the womb of the Earth, are multifaceted. The diverse, autonomous, and Self - conscious parts of our own Being must help the Adepts. Buddhi, Dante’s Beatrice, the Beautiful Helen of Troy, the Spiritual Soul, must help the Ade pt. Fortunate is the Adept who is helped by his Walkiria.

CHAPTER 42 When then Jesus had spoken these words unto his disciples, he said unto them “Who hath ears to hear, let him hear; and let him whose spirit seetheth up in him, come forward and speak the solution of the t hought of the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia.” Philip, the Apostle of Jesus, exists within our own selves, here and now. Philip assists the invoker and takes him out in his astral body. These invokers usually receive multiple benefits. These types of i nvocations are performed when we place ourselves in normal sleep. Philip can also take the invoker with his physical body in Jinn state. The key of the invocation is: “To the little heaven Philip.” Repeat this phrase thousands of times. If we wish to take the physical body, we pray to Philip for this service. If you wish to take only the astral body, you pray to Philip for this service. We must speak to Philip, we must beg Philip. In order to go out in the astral, we require a little bit of sleep. In order to carry the physical body in Jinn State, less sleep is required, and a great deal of faith. The reader must study our “Yellow Book” The historical Philip is one, yet the intimate Philip is another. Each one of us has his inner Philip. The twelve Apostles are the twelve Powers within ourselves. The twelve Apostles are the twelve parts of our own Being. We repeat this for the good of our devotees.

And thou hast not suffered me to come forward to speak the solution of the mysteries of the repentance of Pistis Sophia. For my spirit hath oft times seethed in me a nd been unloosed and constrained me to come forward and speak the solution of the repentance of Pistis Sophia, and I could not come forward because I am the scribe of all the discourses.” Philip always writes the words of the Intimate Christ.

Now, therefore, ye three have to write down all the discourses which I shall speak and [all things which I shall] do and which ye shall see, in order that ye may bear witness to all things of the kingdom of heaven.” Philip, Thomas and Matthew, these three Apostles within ourselves obey the orders of the First Mystery and write the discourses of the Intimate Christ. Besides writing all of that which the Intimate Christ says, sees, and does, the three parts of the Being, Philip, Thomas and Matthew, also have the power to see and hear the things of the Lord. Philip, Thomas and Matthew are the three witnesses of the things of the Kingdom of Heaven . Philip, Thomas and Matthew are really the three parts of our own Being. CHAPTER 43 Mary interpreteth the words of Jesus concerning the three witnesses When then Jesus had said this, he said unto his disciples: “Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.” Ma ry started forward again, stepped into the midst, placed herself by Philip and said unto Jesus: My Lord, my in - dweller of light hath ears, and I am ready to hear with my power, and I have understood the word which thou host spoken."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 106 Now, therefore, my Lord, hearken that I may discourse in openness, thou who host said unto us: “Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.” “Concerning the word which thou host spoken unto Philip: “It is thou and Thomas and Matthew on whom it hath been enjoined to you three by the Firs t Mystery, to write all the discourses of the kingdom of the Light and thereto to bear witness; hearken, therefore, that I may proclaim the solution of this word. This is what thy tight - power prophesied aforetime through Moses; by two or three witnesses sh all every matter be established the three witnesses are Philip and Thomas and Matthew.” All esoteric matter will be established by virtue of three witnesses. It would be absurd to search for the three witnesses outside of ourselves. Obviously, we must sea rch for the three witnesses within ourselves, here and now. In reality, the three Apostles spoken of enjoy of that which is called Self - independence within ourselves. The Divine Mother Kundalini gives testimony of all these things. Philip is now given per mission to speak “It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard this word, that she said: “Well said, Mary, this is the solution of the word. Now, therefore, do thou, Philip, come forward and proclaim the solution of the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia, an d thereafter take thy seat and write all the discourses which I shall speak, until the number of thy portion which thou hast to write of the words of the kingdom of the Light is completed Then shall thou come forward and speak what thy spirit shall underst and But do thou then now proclaim the solution of the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia. And Philip answered and said unto Jesus: “My Lord, harken that I may speak the solution of her repentance. For thy power hath prophesied aforetime concerning it throug h David in the eighty - seventh Psalm, saying: The interior, profound Lord is our Saviour. Philip comprehends all of this. Philip possesses luminous powers in order to understand. Philip possesses luminous powers in order to write. Philip interpreteth the fifth repentance from Psalm LXXXVII 1. Lord, god of my salvation, by day arid by night have I cried unto thee. 2. Let my weeping come before thee; incline thine ear to my supplication, O Lord 3. For my soul is full of evil, my life hath drawn nigh to t he world below. 4. I am counted among them who have gone down into the pit; I am become as a man who hath no helper.

This is then the solution of the mystery of the fifth repentance, which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, when she was oppressed in the chaos. The Intimate Christ is the Instructor of the world. The Intimate Christ is our interior Saviour. Let us repent and cry for our errors. In truth, all of us have been drawn to the inferior world. We are among those who h ave descended into the infernal worlds. Those who even believe themselves to be free are just victims of the ego. We suffer horribly in the pit below, in the reign of Pluto below the crust of the Earth. Fortunate is the One who attains death in himself, he re and now. He then will not undergo the Second Death."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 108 Pistis Sophia can be liberated only by dying within ourselves, based on conscious works and voluntary sufferings. The Initiate who passes through the annihilation of himself reaches the total Illuminat ion. The Initiate is voluntarily placed in an inferior pit. He wishes to die, he wants to die. The Lord can perform marvels with the dead. Fortunate are those who die because they will arise within the Lord. The Name of the Lord will be proclaimed in the t ombs of those who die within themselves. We are poor and miserable, naked and perverse. However, we believe ourselves to be holy and powerful. The interior, profound Lord advises the Initiate. We are surrounded by evil acquaintances; yet, the Lord will eje ct from us those evil acquaintances. Those evil acquaintances are within ourselves. Those evil acquaintances are the perverse psychic aggregates, which we carry in our interior. Those perverse fellows are destroyed, thanks to the Lord. Pistis Sophia is lib erated when our perverse fellows are dead. It would be worthless to possess all the erudition of this world, if we did not die within ourselves. To crush the psychic aggregates is possible, but only in the Forge of the Cyclops during the moment of the chem ical coitus. Man and woman, when sexually united, are surrounded by terrific cosmic forces. Man and woman, when sexually united, are surrounded by those terrific forces that put the Universe into existence. Man is the positive force, woman is the negative force. The neutral force conciliates both of them. If the three forces are directed against any psychic aggregate, then it is reduced to cosmic dust. During the moment of the chemical coitus, the man must help his wife by taking her psychic aggregates as i f they were his own. The woman must take the psychic aggregates of her husband, as if they were her Own. Thus, the positive, negative, and neutral forces perfectly united are directed against any aggregate. This is the key in order to disintegrate psychic aggregates. Man and woman, when sexually united, must pray to the Virgin of the Sea, Devi Kundalini, asking for the disintegration of every psychic aggregate which previously has been deeply comprehended. If the man wants to disintegrate a psychic aggregat e, whether it be hatred, lust, jealously, etc., he will pray to the Divine Mother Kundalini, begging Her for the disintegration of the psychic aggregate. His wife will help him with the same prayer, as if the aggregate was her own. As well, the man will pr oceed with the psychic aggregates of his wife, as if they were his own."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 109 The totality of the forces of the man and the woman during the metaphysical copulation must be directed to the psychic aggregates of the man, and to the psychic aggregates of the woman .

We must not forget that when the man and the woman are united during the chemical coitus they are truly, one divine, omnipotent and terrific Androgynous. CHAPTER 44 Philip is commended and continueth writing. It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard Philip speak these words that he said: “Welt said, Philip, well - beloved. Now, therefore, come take thy seat and write thy portion of alt the discourses which I shall speak, and [of all things which I shall] do, and of all that thou shall see.” And forthwith Philip sat down and wrote. It came to pass thereafter that Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: ‘then did Pistis Sophia cry to the Li ght. It forgave her sin, in that she had left her region and gone down into the darkness. She uttered the sixth repentance, saying thus: The Father of all lights forgives Pistis Sophia’ s sin of having fallen into the darkness of the No - Being. Pain reigns supremely within the darkness of the No - Being. However, the descent is necessary in order to later re - ascend victoriously. The victorious re - ascension implies total transformation.

For I have left my region and am come down into the c haos. “Now, therefore, whose mind is exalted, let him understand.” The Initiate sings praises unto the Great Light even though he is working below, within the obscurity and the august silence of the Wise. Really, we need the forgiveness of the Great Ligh t. If the Light always thinks on our errors, then the Light would never forgive us, and we would never advance. The Light of his Name is the Name of the Light, which the Being of our Being possesses. The Mystery of Mysteries is experienced by conscious fai th. The Initiate trusts in the Light when he finds himself among those who dwell in the heights. The Initiate trusts in the Light when he works in the super - obscurity and the august silence of the Wise. All the autonomous and Self - conscious parts of our ow n individual Being must have complete trust in the Interior Light, here and now. When we work in the Abyss, we must have complete trust in the Light, and we must not dismay. No one can ascend without having previously descended. We must steal the Light fro m the Darkness. The Light pities us and guides us. A great Mystery of salvation exists within the Light. The Light must carry all the powers of each one of us out of the Chaos. It is understood that the powers are each one of the independent parts of the B eing that descend into the Chaos and suffer. Obviously, each one of the independent parts of our own individual Being must be perfected. The twelve Apostles, which means the twelve parts of our Being, the twelve Powers, must be perfected within ourselves, here and now. People only want to know about the twelve historical Apostles, but they do not understand anything about the twelve parts of our own individual Being. We must search for the twelve within ourselves. It is urgent to perfect the twelve Apostles within ourselves. Let us remember that twelve are the foundations of the Celestial Jerusalem, and that the name of each one of the twelve is written in each foundation. Thus, each one of the twelve names of the twelve Apostles corresponds to his correspon ding foundation."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 111 We must destroy Babylon the Great, the mother of all fornication and abominations of the Earth.

Twelve are the foundations of the Celestial Jerusalem. The perfection of the twelve is possible only by disintegrating the psychic aggregates. Rare is he whose mind has been saved. The wall of the Celestial Jerusalem is construct ed of 144 cubits, according to the measure of a man that is of Angel. If we make the addition of the numerals 144, we get nine. Nine is the Kabbalistic number of the Ninth Sphere. Nine is the sexual sphere. The total disintegration of the psychic aggregate s is possible only by working in the Ninth Sphere. We liberate the Essence and we build the Celestial Jerusalem only by disintegrating the aggregates here and now. CHAPTER 45 It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his dis ciples, that he said unto them: “Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?” Andrew came forward and said: “My Lord, concerning the solution of the sixth repentance of Pistis Sophia, thy light - power prophesied aforetime through David in the one - hun dred - and - twenty - ninth Psalm, saying: Andrew and his Cross is something profoundly significant. The Cross of St. Andrew on which he died crucified is alchemical. There are terrible psychological tortures through which we must pass in order to disintegrate the Dry Mercury, in other words, the psychic aggregates, which are the living personification of our psychological defects. The Sulphur (Fire) and Mercury (Water), are crossed in the form of an ‘X’, and they cross again incessantly in the Great Work. The M ercury of the Wise is the metallic soul of the sperm. The metallic soul of the sperm must be fecundated by the Sulphur. Andrew and his doctrine is the struggle for the disintegration of the psychic aggregates. Andrew, with his Cross, must crystallize the S ulphur and the Mercury in the form of the existential, superior bodies of the Being. The Sulphur and the Mercury, crossed in the first octave, crystallize in the form of the astral body. In the second octave, they take the form of the mental body, and in t he third octave, they take the form of the causal body. It is indispensable to possess these bodies in order to receive the psychic principles and to convert ourselves into real human beings. The interior Andrew perfects himself when the superior existenti al bodies of the Being have been perfected."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 112 It is not possible to perfect these bodies unless we have previously eliminated the psychic aggregates, living personification of our psychological defects. Andrew must disintegrate the Dry Mercury and the Arseni c Sulphur. Andrew must crystallize the prepared Philosophical Mercury. Andrew suffers when disintegrating the Dry Mercury. Christification could not be possible without the previous disintegration of the Dry Mercury. When the existential bodies are perfect ed, they become pure Gold. Creating the bodies is only one part. To perfect them is urgent and not to be delayed. Andrew interpreteth the sixth repentance from Psalm CXXIX 1. Out of the depths I have cried unto thee, O Lord. 2. Hearken unto my voice; le t thine ears give heed to the voice of my supplication. 3. O Lord, if thou heedest my iniquities, who will be able to pass [the test]? 4.

Let Israel hope in the Lord from the morning until the evening. 7. For grace standeth by the Lord and with him is great redemption. 8. And he will deliver Israel from all his i niquities. The ordeal of the Sanctuary is very difficult. Very few human beings are capable of passing such a terrible ordeal. The interior profound Lord knows very well what our iniquities are. We will pass the terrible ordeal of the Sanctuary by disinte grating these iniquities, This ordeal contains in itself all the ordeals. This ordeal is in itself multiple ordeals. The Omni merciful forgives many errors, if truly we deserve forgiveness. The Soul always waits for the word of the Lord. It is not enough t o hear the word; we must perform the word within ourselves, here and now. Whosoever hears the word and does not perform it is like a man who sees his reflection in the mirror and turns and walks away. The Soul awaits for the interior, profound Lord. Israel hopes in the Lord from the morning until the evening, ISRAEL is a word that must be analyzed. ‘IS’ reminds us of Isis and the Isiac Mysteries. ‘RA’ reminds us of the Solar Logos."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 113 Let us remember the disc of RA found in the ancient Egypt of the Pharaohs. ‘ HE’ is ‘HE’. ‘HE’ is the interior, profound God within each one of us. In sequence and correct etymological corollary, the people of Israel are constituted by the various parts of the Being. All of the multiple Self - conscious and independent parts of our o wn individual Being constitute the people of Israel. The grace of the interior Lord falls on us when, in reality, we have passed through the Buddhist Annihilation. Jesus commendeth Andrew. He promiseth that the tyrants shall be judged and consumed by the wise fire Jesus said unto him: “Well said, Andrew, blessed one. This is the solution of her repentance. Amen, amen, I say unto you I will perfect you in all mysteries of the Light and all gnosis from the interiors of the interiors to the exteriors of the exteriors, from the Ineffable down to the darkness of darknesses, from the Light of lights down to the.... of matter, from all the gods down to the demons, from all the lords down to the decans, from all the authorities down to the servitors, from the crea tion of men down to [that] of the wild beasts, of the cattle and of the reptiles, in order that ye may be called perfect, perfected in all fullness. Amen, Amen, I say unto you in the region where I shall be in the kingdom of my Father, ye will also be with me. And when the perfect number is completed, so that the Mixture shall be dissolved, I will give commandment that they bring all tyrant gods, who have not given up the purification of their light, arid will give commandment to the wise fire, over which t he perfect pass, to eat into those tyrants, until they give up the last purification of their light.” Obviously, Andrew will perfect himself in the Mysteries of the Light with his Cross in an ‘X’ and with his complicated and terribly difficult work, which is to crystallize that which must be crystallized and to disintegrate that which must be disintegrated. The tortures of St. Andrew are sufficient for his purification. Nevertheless, we must not forget our individual, interior Andrew. Each one of us has hi s own Andrew. Behold here what is terribly difficult, which is, to perfect him from the interiors of the interiors to the exteriors of the exteriors. In the Great Work, Andrew, suffering on the sexual cross, must perfect himself from the Ineffable down to the Darkness of darknesses, from the Light of lights down to the darkness of matter, from all the Gods down to the demons. Andrew must perfect himself by virtue of conscious works and voluntary sufferings, from all the lords down to the decans, from all th e authorities down to the servitors, etc., etc... Each one of the parts of the Being must reach the total, integral perfection. Andrew is one of the autonomous and Self - conscious parts. Andrew is integrated with the Father when perfected within each one of o urselves. Let us remember that we need to perfect each one of the twelve within ourselves, here and now.

Obviously, the Lord of time can give back the memories of our past lives. Within each one of us, there exists our own particular, individual Anubis. He applies the law of Karma to us, within our selves. The Divine Mother Kundalini within ourselves has five aspects, allegorized by the white cow with five legs. H.P.B. really did see an authentic white cow with five legs in India. There is no doubt that it carried the fifth leg on its back and with t his leg it was scaring flies or scratching itself. H.P.B. states that this curious creature of Nature was herded by a young boy from the Sadhu sect. This virgin boy nourished himself exclusively with the milk of this mysterious cow. Within ourselves, there exists Minerva, she who gives us wisdom. The Guardian of the Threshold exists within ourselves. The Guardian of the Threshold can never be disintegrated, because it is part of our own individual Being. The Guardian of the Threshold is a full - length mirror that shows us the psychological state in which we find ourselves at each given moment. We have the Guardian of the Threshold in the astral, mental, and causal planes. There are three Guardians of the Threshold, three parts of our own individual Being. Eac h one of the three parts is autonomous, individual, and Self - conscious. The Policeman of Karma exists within ourselves, within our Consciousness. He conduces us before the tribunals of the Law when we violate the Law. The Being is a true army that must be perfected and integrated. The whole work is sexual. There exists no other way. The independent parts of the Being are many, and we must perfect each one of them. We have not given notice to all the parts of the Being, because we would need volumes in order to talk about them and their work. When the Being will become integrated, and the horrifying mixture of the diverse, undesirable psychic elements which we carry within our interior will become dissolved, then the perverse tyrants will fall. The tyrants th at we carry within our interior are the capital factors of our abominable psychic processes. Mary Interpreteth the words of Jesus It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his disciples, that he said unto them: “Understand y e in what manner I speak with you?” Mary said: “Yea, Lord, I have understood the word which thou host spoken.

All the disciples of the Intimate Christ reside within ourselves. They are precisely the diverse autonomous and Self - conscious parts of our own Being. The tyrant gods are really those autonomous and independent parts of the Being who are bottled up in lights, which are not the Christic Light. Yet, they persist in purifying their light, which is not the Light of the Lord. For example, and in order to clarify the previous paragraph, we will say that in the world there exist certain religious forms that lead only to a dead - end street. However, their parishioners persist in purifying and sanctifying themselves withi n these cages. We must renounce these doctrines. We must have the courage to abandon these cages. What is important is that which is within our own selves. Gnosis is knowledge. In Gnosis, Self - Gnosis is Self - knowledge. The wise Fire will bite into the tyra nt gods until they renounce the many doctrines that exist in the exterior world. We must abandon all in order to arrive to the Intimate Christ. When we say abandon all, we are referring in this case to the diverse, dead religious forms. Someone can fight f or his very own purification in a completely mistaken way. We march correctly only on the path of Self - Gnosis. God shall sit in the assembly (synagogue) of the gods and will submit them to a trial. Jesus said unto her: “Well said, Mary.” CHAPTER 46 The r epentance of Sophia is not yet accepted she is mocked by the Aeons Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: “it came to pass, when Pistis Sophia had finished uttering the sixth repentance for the forgiveness of her transgression , that she turned again to the height, to see if her sins were forgiven her, and to see whether they would lead her up out of the chaos. But by commandment of the First Mystery not yet was she hearkened to, so that her sin should be forgiven and she should be led up out of the chaos. When then she had turned to the height to see whether her repentance were accepted from her, she saw all the rulers of the twelve Aeons mocking at her and rejoicing over her because her repentance was not accepted from her.

The Initiate has faith in the Great Light. Whosoever has faith in the Great Light is never placed in shame. The tenebrous ones who take the power away from the Initiate remain in darkness. Those tenebrous ones are the undesirable psychic aggregates, living Personifications of our psychological defects. The Great Light has its paths and its secret path.

Many are those who begin, rare are those who attain the arr ival to the goal. At times, the path is lost within the sands of the desert. At times, the path is cut by a dangerous abyss. At times, we must descend in order to later re - ascend. Not one moral code and not one ethic precept serves purpose on the difficult path. On this difficult path, we must always take inventory of ourselves in order to know what is excessive in us, and to know of what we are lacking. It is necessary to eliminate what is left over in us. We must obtain what we are lacking. At times, a be autiful maxim or precious virtue can serve as an obstacle for us on the difficult path. It is necessary to know good from evil and evil from good, and to pass beyond good and evil. We must liberate ourselves from the powers of good and evil. There is the n eed to grasp the sword of Cosmic Justice. What is believed to be good is not always good. What is believed to be evil is not always evil. There is a great deal of virtue in the evil ones. There is a great deal of evil in the virtuous ones. Virtue comes fro m the syllable VIR, VIRILITY. The precious gems of virtues are obtained only with virility. Sexual virility, sexual potency is necessary to obtain virtues in the Flaming Forge of Vulcan. Each time that a psychic aggregate is dissolved a precious virtue eme rges in ourselves. The interior, profound Saviour is Light, and we must trust in Him. Only the Intimate Christ who is Light can save us. Sexual transgression occurred when we ate the fruit of which was said to us: “You shall not eat.” Christ, being the sup reme obedience of the Father, opposes Himself to the supreme disobedience of the sinful Adam and He saves us. The Great Mystery of the forgiveness of sins is related with sex. Only the one who works in the Great Work deserves to be forgiven. We deserve the forgiveness of these or those faults, when their corresponding inhuman elements are dissolved within ourselves. Determined psychic aggregates are found related with the Law of Karma. Obviously, they can be disintegrated by paying their price. Undoubtedly, these aggregates are disintegrated based on conscious works and voluntary sufferings. In order to be saved from the great transgression, the Light gives us the manner, the way, and the system or method. The material emanations of the ego have damaged the human faculties. In ancient times, humanity perceived the aura of the worlds, and was communicating with other inhabitants of the planetary spheres. The human beings in the Lemurian continent, situated in the Pacific Ocean in previous times, perceived the Mysteries of life and death by themselves and in a direct way. We fell into animal generation with sexual transgression. Then, within each one of us, the ego emerged. The ego is a compound of diverse psychic aggregates. The faculties of internal perception of the human being became atrophied when the"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 119 Essence was kept bottled up within the psychic aggregates. Thus, the material emanations of the Self - willed ego damaged the internal faculties. Since then, the human beings have been trapped in this painful wor ld. Our internal faculties will victoriously emerge by dissolving the psychic aggregates. All of the knowledge contained in the Light corresponds to the Mysteries. The Mysteries of the Light lead us to the Final Liberation. The lost Inheritance is the Trea sury of the Light, which is hidden within ourselves, here and now. The Mystery of the Name is the very same Mystery of the Verb. Each one of us has his own sacred Name. Whosoever trusts in the Great Light will receive initiation into the Mysteries. Fortuna te is the one who by means of the initiations into the Mysteries succeeds in converting himself into an inhabitant of the Region of the Light. Those who submerge themselves within the Ocean of the Great Light possess the power and the Treasury of the Light . Only the Light can save our feet from the bonds of Darkness. Whosoever has faith in the Light will be saved from the Darkness. In the Chaos below, even the Sacred Name is forgotten. The afflictions have become exceedingly manifold, due to the psychic agg regates. Only the Light can save us from sin and from the Darkness. The Rulers of the Twelve Aeons are very jealous, in a spiritual sense. In no way can they accept any psychic element within ourselves. This signifies that they are very strict within ourse lves. Only the Great Light can save us and fortify the powers of the Soul. The Initiate has faith in the Light. The Rulers of the Aeons are mocking us within ourselves, and they growl at us when we are working, or beginning to work on ourselves. The Rulers of the Aeons say to us: “Ah! At last you want to come to the Light? Do you want to disintegrate in an instant that which gave you pleasure during many centuries???” Etc., etc., etc... “How dare you ask to be helped to disintegrate in one instant of repentan ce that which you have enjoyed so long?” This is how the Rulers of the Aeons speak when they mock us. This is how Pistis Sophia suffers. Only the Great Light can save our intimate powers from the emanations of the Self - willed ego. Being sober signifies be ing comprehensive, in the integral sense of the word. Thomas is the part of the Being who is related with the intimate sense of comprehension. A great deal of analysis, reflection, and above all, meditation and evident self - reflection of the Being are ind ispensable for comprehension. Any psychological defect discovered through the self - psychological observation must be previously comprehended in all the levels of the mind, before proceeding to its disintegration. When one accepts the fact that he has his o wn psychological idiosyncrasy, he then begins to self - observe himself from instant to instant."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 120 Self - discovery is possible only through self - observation. Self - revelation exists in all self - discovery. Then, Thomas is cognition, comprehension, and infinite pa tience. The brothers of Thomas are eleven in number, and even more. They are all the autonomous and Self - conscious parts of the Being. Unquestionably, all the parts of the Being are obliged to work in the inner Self - realization of the Being. The work of T homas is very patient, because he is obliged to provide that which is called comprehension. Each part of the Being gives its solution to the repentance of the Soul. However, only Thomas gives the last word. Thomas interpreteth the seventh repentance from Psalm XXIV 1. O Lord, unto thee have I lifted up my soul, O my God 2. I have abandoned myself unto thee; let me not be put to shame and let not mine enemies mock at me. 3. For all who wait upon thee shall not be put to shame; let them be put to shame wh o do iniquity without a cause. 4. O Lord, show me thy ways and teach me thy paths. 5. Lead me in the way of thy truth and teach me, for thou art my God and my Saviour; on thee will I wait all day long. 6. Call to remembrance thy mercies, O Lord, and the favours of thy grace, for they are from eternity. 7. Remember not the sins of my youth and those of my ignorance. Remember me according to the fullness of thy mercy because of thy goodness, O Lord. 8. The Lord is gracious and sincere; therefore will he instruct sinners in the way. 9. He will guide the tender - hearted in the judgement and will teach the tender - hearted his ways. 10. All the ways of the Lord are grace and truth for them who seek his virtuousness and his testimonies. 11. For thy name’s sak e, O Lord, forgive me my sin, [for] it is exceedingly great. 12. Who is the man who feareth the Lord? For him will he establish laws in the way, which he hath chosen. "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 121 13. His souls will abide in good things and his seed will inherit the land. 14. The Lo rd is the strength of them who fear him; and the name of the Lord belongeth to them who fear him, to make known unto them his covenant. 15. Mine eyes are raised ever unto the Lord, for he will draw my feet out of the snare. 16. Look down upon me and be g racious unto me, for I am an only begotten; I am wretched. 17. The afflictions of my heart have increased; bring me out of my necessities. 18. Look upon my abasement and my woe, and forgive me all my sins. 19.

O God, deliver Israel from all his afflictions. We must lift up the Soul unto the Lord. We must completely deliver ourselves to our interior profound God. The enemies that mock us are within ourselves. Whosoever works on himself, waiting upon the Intimate Lord, shall not be p ut to shame. It is obvious that the interior enemies who commit iniquity shall be put to shame. The Intimate Lord will show us the ways and the paths. There exist four paths: 1. The Direct Path. 2. The Nirvanic Spiral Path. 3. The path of those who are se parate from the Cosmic Scenario, without having reached the level of Adept. 4. The path of those who fail. The Direct Path is the most magnificent. However, the sufferings are great, therefore the triumphs are also great. On the Spiral Path, the triumphs are minor; therefore, the sufferings are minor. The inhabitants of Nirvana are rarely reincarnated. The inhabitants of Nirvana live in constant happiness. When they take a body, they take one step ahead, and they return into happiness."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 122 Those who r enounce cosmic manifestation become submerged within the Universal Spirit of Life following the dissolution of the ego. Yet, they submerge without having built the existential superior bodies of the Being. Nevertheless, some of those who renounce cosmic ma nifestation will return in the Golden Age of the future Sixth Root Race. Then, they will enter into the Mysteries and they will convert themselves into Adepts. The fourth path, the ones who fail, are those who after having accomplished three thousand (3,00 0) cycles or periods of manifestation did not attain the level of Adept. Each cycle of manifestation contains the processes of passing through the mineral, plant, animal and human kingdoms. 108 lives are assigned to each Soul while in the human kingdom. It is ostensible that when the 108 human lives in each cycle is concluded, then, the time to move downwards into the infernal worlds, into involution, until the Second Death arrives. The infernal worlds are situated within the interior of the Earth, in the s ubmerged mineral kingdom. Following the Second Death, the Essence emerges again to the surface. When the Essence has emerged again, then new evolving processes begin which repeat themselves from the lowest step. The lowest step is the mineral kingdom. Each time the cycle is repeated through the mineral kingdom, it is performed in a higher spiral, in accordance with the spiral of life. The laws of evolution and involution of life constitute the mechanical axis of all of Nature. Those who fail in all of the t hree thousand periods of manifestation submerge themselves within the ocean of the Great Light, converted into simple elementals of Nature. This is after they have followed the Second Death in their last human life of the three thousandth cycle or period. Obviously, such failures lose all opportunity. Nevertheless, these types of elementals know good and evil due to their lived experiences. The fortune for those elementals is well gained, due to the infinite pain through which they had to pass in their pere grination through matter. The laws of evolution or involution have nothing to do with the inner Self - realization of the Being. The path of the revolution of the Consciousness is the inner Self - realization of the Being. It is the path of the Great Rebellio n. Only our Intimate God can lead us to the experience of the Truth. The favours of grace are from the Intimate Christ, and come from all eternity. The Great Merciful One can have pity on us and help us. The secret way is taught by the Merciful One, who re sides within our Being. The Intimate Lord will guide our steps if we are bountiful and tender hearted. The virtue and the testimonies that we seek are found in the ways of the Lord. We need to be forgiven for our sins, which are exceedingly great. The laws of the interior, profound Lord are perfect, and they must be established in the heart.

The Intimate Lord is the strength of all powers. The Name of the Lor d, the Verb within us, the real Being of the Being, belongs to those who possess it. Only the Christified human beings possess the incarnated Verb, the Word, the Name of the Lord. Only the Lord will draw our feet from the abyss of perdition. Each one of us is an only begotten and is wretched. Only the Lord can save us. Only the Lord can liberate us from our miseries, and give us a precious balm in order to cure our painful heart.

Only the Intimate Lord can deliver Israel, which means, deliver all the independent and Self - conscious parts far away from all a fflictions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to dissolve the psychic aggregates before arriving to the Port of Supreme Happiness. Jesus commendeth Thomas And Jesus had heard the words of Thomas, he said unto him: “Well said, Thomas, and finely. This is the solution of the seventh repentance of Pistis Sophia. Amen, amen, I say unto you: All generations of the world shall bless you on earth, because I have revealed this unto you and ye have received of my spirit and have become understanding and spiritual, und erstanding what I say.” “And hereafter will I fill you full with the whole light and the whole power of the spirit, so that ye may understand from now on all which shall be said unto you and which ye shall see. Yet a little while and I will speak with you concerning the height without within and within without.” “Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples:” Those who pretend to reach the Final Liberation, without having previously eliminated the multiple undesirable psychic elements that we carry within our interior, walk on the path of error. Great hermits or anchorites were known to have lived in lonely caverns in the Orient. Due to the fortitude of multiple disciplines, they reached ecstasy. However, they failed because they did n ot dissolve the ego. Those anchorites were accustomed to momentarily taking the Essence, the Buddhi out of the bottle. They then experienced Satori and Samadhi. Yet, following that mystic experience, they returned into the bottle like the genie of the lamp of Aladdin. Some of these Saints died in complete Mahasamadhi. Nevertheless, presently such Beings have returned as vulgar, common and current persons. They were skilled in Samadhi, yet, when not working on the ego, the result is failure. To experience th e illuminated Void does not signify the Self - realization of the Illuminated Void."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 124 All of that which Thomas knows has been received from the Intimate Christ. The abridgement or synthetic summum of the doctrine of Thomas can be summarized as this: “Do not de pend on ideals or foreign concepts because the real wisdom is within oneself.” Nevertheless, before we can absolutely depend on our own Interior Being, we must be completely obedient to our Guru. Every authentic Guru pronounces himself against fornication and adultery. Every authentic Guru is a Twice Born. Every authentic Guru sacrifices himself for humanity. To be born, to die, and to sacrifice for humanity are the three factors of the Revolution of the Consciousness. The Guru, who spills Hermes’ glass, is a false Guru, a false Prophet. The Guru who does not teach his disciples to build the solar, existential, superior Bodies of the Being is not a proper Guru in the knowledge. The Guru who does not guide his disciples through the path of the dissolution of the ego is a mistaken Guru or Black Magician. The Guru who does not know how to sacrifice himself for humanity is not a true Guru. There exists the space above and the interior space. The space above is exterior with respect to the interior. But there exis ts the exteriors of the exteriors and the interiors of the interiors. Any exterior space located in one or another dimension has as opposition, its corresponding interior space. CHAPTER 47 Jesus leadeth Sophia to a less confined region, but without the c ommandment of the First Mystery “It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had uttered the seventh repentance in the chaos, that the commandment through the First Mystery had not come to me to save her and lead her up out of the chaos. Nevertheless of myse lf out of compassion without commandment I led her into a somewhat spacious region in the chaos. And when the material emanations of Self willed had noticed that she had been led into a somewhat spacious region in the chaos, they ceased a little to oppress her, for they thought that she would be led up out of the chaos altogether. When this then took place, Pistis Sophia did not know that I was her helper; nor did she know me at all, but she continued and persisted withal singing praises to the Light of the Treasury, which she had seen aforetime and on which she had had faith, and she thought that it [the Light] also was her helper and it was the same to which she had sung praises, thinking it was the Light in truth. But as indeed she had had faith in the Li ght, which belongeth to the Treasury in truth, therefore will she be led up out of the chaos and her repentance will be accepted from her. But the commandment of the First Mystery was not yet accomplished to accept her repentance from her. But hearken now in order that I may tell you all things, which befell Pistis Sophia.” "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 125 Only the commandment of the First Mystery can conduce the Initiate out of the Chaos. The Intimate Christ feels compassion for the Initiate, and little by little, He is passing him to s uperior levels of the Being. The material emanations of the Self - willed ego are disappearing little by little in the same measure that the Initiate is dying. It is an error of Pistis Sophia to not recognize the extra help of the Intimate Christ. The Light of the interior Treasury emerges from the same Treasury, which is the Golden Fleece. The Golden Fleece of ancient people is the Intimate Christ, clothed with the bodies of pure Gold. These perfected existential bodies, which are covered by the distinct par ts of the Being, are terribly divine. The Light of the Treasury is not the Treasury. However, the Initiate sings praises to the Light of the Treasury. It is necessary to search for the Treasury within the womb of the Philosophical Earth. VITRIOL signifies: “Visita Interiora Terrae Rect Invenies Occulturn Lapidem” Many types of light exist which are not the Light of the Treasury. Diverse types of sects, schools, or mystic orders possess a light, which is not the Light of the Treasury. However, their devotees believe that this light can save them. Those devotees are sincerely mistaken ones, full of magnificent intentions, but mistaken ones. The true Light of the hidden Treasury is absolutely sexual. The repentance of Pistis Sophia must be qualified. Receiving one or another, or the whole eight Initiations of the Fire is one thing. However, the qualification of them is another completely different thing. Anyone can receive the eight Initiations of the Fire. However, if he does not pass the qualification of them, these Initiations will be worthless for him. Many who have received the eight Initiations of the Fire are now terribly perverse demons. If the dissolution of the ego is excluded, then, the qualification of the eight Initiations is impossible. Only through the Buddhist Annihilation can we qualify for each one of the eight Initiations. We will obtain the radical change, by virtue of the disintegration of the ego. We need to convert ourselves into something totally different. We must even lose our very person al identity. The change must be absolute. Not even our actual personal identity must continue to exist. The emanations of the Self - willed cease for a time to oppress Sophia “It came to pass, when I had led her unto a somewhat spacious region in the chaos , that the emanations of Self - willed ceased entirely to oppress her, thinking that she would be led up out of the chaos altogether. It came to pass then, when the emanations of Self - willed had noticed that Pistis Sophia had not been led up out of the chaos , that they turned about again all together oppressing her vehemently. Because of this then she uttered the eighth repentance, because they had"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 126 not ceased to oppress her, and had turned about to oppress her to the utmost. She uttered this repentance, sayin g thus: The emanations of the Self - willed ego bother Pistis Sophia. However, these emanations cease a little when she passes into a superior level of the Being. Every time the Initiate passes through a new revaluation of the Being, the attacks of the tene brous ones always cease for a while in order for the attacks to later restart into new activity. Nevertheless, in each battle, Pistis Sophia reiterates the repentance one time after another. The eighth repentance of Sophia 1. On thee, O Light, have I hop ed. Leave me not in the chaos; deliver me and save me according to thy gnosis. 2. Give heed unto me and save me. Be unto me a Saviour, O Light, and save me and lead me unto thy light. 3. For thou art my Saviour and wilt lead me unto thee. And because of the mystery of thy name lead me and give me thy mystery. 4. And thou wilt save me from this lion - faced power, which they have laid as a snare for me, for thou art my saviour. 5. And in thy hands will I lay the purification of my light; thou hast saved me , O Light, according to thy gnosis. 6. Thou art become wroth with them who keep watch over me and will not be able to lay hold of me utterly. But I have had faith in the Light. 7. I will rejoice and will sing praises that thou hast had mercy upon me and hast heeded and saved me from the oppression in which I was. And thou wilt set free my power out of the chaos. 8. And thou hast not left me in the hand of the lion - faced power; but thou hast led me into a region, which is not oppressed. The Light must gu ide us and save us, according to Gnosis. The Gnostic Light must save us and lead us to the Great Light. The Mystery of the Name is the Mystery of the Verb. Every Initiate aspires to receive the Mystery of the Name. “Whosoever knows, the word gives power to , no one has uttered it, no one will utter it, except the one who has incarnated it.” Christ is the Word. Fortunate is the one who has incarnated Him. The lion - faced power, or the face of the Law makes us suffer.

The individual, interior light must be purified by virtue of the disintegration of the psychic aggregates. The Intimate Christ is severe against those who keep watch over Pistis Sophia. Only the Christ - Light can take Sophia in definite form out of the Chaos. The lion - faced power is the power of the Law. The Lion of the Law exists within our own Being. It is one of the parts of the Being. In certain epochs, the Initiat e is not afflicted by the Law of Karma. When Pistis Sophia rests, free from the lion - faced power, she feels happy. CHAPTER 48 The emanations of Self - willed oppress her again. When then Jesus hail said this unto his disciples, he answered again and said unto them “It came to pass then, when the lion - faced power had noticed that Pistis Sophia had not been led up altogether out of the chaos, that it came again with all the other material emanations of Self - willed, and they oppressed Pistis Sophia again. It came to pass then, when they oppressed her, that she cried out in the same repentance, saying: The lion - faced power and the Self - willed ego makes the Initiate suffers terribly. Obviously, Karma and the emanations of the ego take the powers from the Initia te. The Archons of the Aeons and the twenty - four Elders of the Zodiac are within ourselves. The Pair, the other Soul, cannot help us if the Great Law is against us. The Spiritual Soul contemplates while the Human Soul works. The Intimate is ‘Atman’, the In effable One. Buddhi is the Spiritual Soul. Superior Manas is the Human Soul. The two Souls are integrated with the resurrection of Christ within ourselves. Then, there is Light. Buddhi is like a fine and transparent glass made of alabaster, within which th e Flame of Prajna burns. Buddhi - Manas united, integrated and in fusion, confers us the Light. All the powers of the Light are contained within Buddhi, as in a glass made of alabaster. Obviously, the Light is established within ourselves with the fusion of Buddhi Manas.

Those who believe that they can re - conquer the Light without h aving previously dissolved the psychic aggregates march in the way of error. The psychic aggregates, living personifications of our psychological defects, constitute in themselves a material power, which is abandoned by the Rulers. The Soul, submerged in t he interior Chaos, which dwells within ourselves, has been converted into a true Chaos. All of the impious forces surround the fallen one and intend to steal the bit of Light, which remains within him. The Initiate must trust in the Light. The Light will s ave him. The emanations of the Self - willed ego pursue and oppress the Initiate. We can be saved by disintegrating the ego. The emanations of the Self - willed ego, which means, of the psychic aggregates, must be disintegrated with the weapons of Vulcan. Dry Mercury and psychic aggregates are the same. Only through the transcendental sexual electricity can the totality of the Dry - Mercury be disintegrated. Thus, Pistis Sophia can be liberated. Sexual magic is urgent and not to be delayed in order to liberate P istis Sophia. The Woman - Serpent is reinforced within the Flaming forge of Vulcan.

The Woman - Serpent has in her power the marvelous weapons of Vulcan. The total disintegration of all the psychic aggregates is possible only in the Ninth Sphere, and with the help of the Woman - Serpent. The Ninth Sphere is sex, t he metaphysical copulation, the chemical coitus. The Woman - Serpent saves Pistis Sophia. Man and woman sexually united are the foundation of the Luni - Solar Androgenism of ‘IO’, Isis - Osiris. Isolda, Parabrahatman and Mulaprakriti are the same pure Androgenis m. The Androgilia of Ammonio Saccas, written in Latin, teaches all this. Ur - Anas, the primordial fire and primordial water are within the Ninth Sphere. The learned ignoramuses absurdly suppose that they can disintegrate the ego outside of the Ninth Sphere. We do not deny that serious devotees can disintegrate twenty - five percent, and even fifty percent of their psychic aggregates outside of the Ninth Sphere. Nevertheless, one hundred percent of the psychic aggregates can never be disintegrated outside of th e Ninth Sphere. Those who cannot work in the Ninth Sphere, for some very grave reason, must not become discouraged. They can disintegrate twenty - five percent, and even fifty percent of their psychic aggregates by working individually on themselves. Thus, t his is how in their present existence, they will advance to the point possible for them. Then, in their future existences, they will conclude with their work. This is not a matter of being better. It is a matter of changing radically and this is possible o nly by disintegrating our psychic aggregates. Truthfully, nothing within ourselves deserves to be better. For such motive, the Buddhist Annihilation is urgent, if a total transformation is what we truly want. It is not a matter of evolving, like the fanati cs of the dogma of evolution pretend. Obviously, the undesirable psychic elements that we carry within our interior never deserve any type of evolution. The emanations of the Self - willed ego must be taken down towards the regions where only the weeping and gnashing of teeth are heard. May the mouth of the tenebrous ones be shut up. They are all the monsters of Darkness. They are the psychic aggregates that we carry in our interior, which make attempts against Pistis Sophia.

The energy of the Universal Spirit is represented in the flaming sword, which corresponds to the Sun. The scale, in itself, an d by itself indicates the necessity of weights and proportions. The ‘open book’ has an extraordinary meaning in Alchemy. Profoundly significant is the meaning of the ‘open book’, characterized by the radical solution of the metallic body, which is abandoni ng its impurities and granting its Sulphur. The closed book is the general symbol of all the brute bodies, minerals or metals, just as Nature provides them, or as human industry provides them for commerce. The brute Azoth, which is the sacred sperm not yet worked with, is a closed book. We need to open that book. From another angle, the open book is the book of Law and Justice. Justice, Lion, Scale and Sword are found intimately associated. The outer garment of Ermine that the Goddess Justice shows is embro idered with roses and pearls. The Goddess Justice has a buccal crown girded upon her forehead. The Sword of Justice has a pommet adorned with a radiant sun. The peplum that was completely covering her has slid down on her body and it is suspended by her pr ojecting arm, and the lower part is folded. Justice, within ourselves, is a Self - conscious part of the Being. Justice, within ourselves, must be Self - realized intimately. Within ourselves, and as an autonomous and Self - conscious part of the Being, Minerva, daughter of Jupiter, is the cardinal virtue of Justice. Minerva is also Divine Wisdom and complete knowledge of all things. Minerva, Goddess of Wisdom and Lady of Justice is the flower of the Great Work, the Mystic Rose. Justice is a Virgin with a golden crown, white tunic, and a purple robe. The Goddess Justice wears an exquisite jewel upon her chest. The Goddess Justice rests her left foot upon a cubic stone."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 132 We will explain all the profound significance of all of this in our next book entitled, The Grea t Work. In any case, we need to intimately Self - realize the Goddess Justice within ourselves. Our Christ - Lord within ourselves can save us according to Justice. In no way can we intimately Self - realize Minerva within ourselves, unless we previously pass th rough the Buddhist Annihilation. The Intimate Lord is our Protector God. We must annihilate the psychic aggregates and find refuge within the Lord. The Lord can save us from the merciless snare, which is laid by the secret enemy. We must place our Spirit i n the hands of the Intimate Christ. The Lord rejects those who latch onto vanity. The Lord helps those who fight for the disintegration of the psychic aggregates of vanity. In no way could it be possible to keep correct relations with the Intimate Lord and with all the independent and Self - conscious parts of the Being, if we do not previously annihilate all the psychic aggregates of vanity. Vanity destroys the possibilities of illumination. Illumination is grandiose; yet, it is possible only by annihilating the psychic aggregates of vanity. Illumination is a grace of the Lord. Only the humble one can receive illumination by grace of the Lord. Those who have not annihilated the psychic aggregates of pride cannot in any way reach illumination. The Lord never s huts us up in the hands of our interior enemies. One becomes astonished while in the presence of the craziness of anger. The eyes of the angry one reveal complete madness. The very devout people, apparently very simple within the temples, turn themselves i nto frightful creatures during attacks of anger. Some people who are studying our teachings, who are dedicated to the dissolution of the undesirable psychic aggregates that we carry within our interior, suddenly become full of great anger. Within thunder a nd lightning, they rip their vestures. The psychic aggregates of anger are multiple. There is anger because of jealousy, because of hatred, because of frustrated desires, because of selfish monetary motives, because of disputed matters, because of tenor, o r because of various states of spirit, mind, body, and tongue, etc., etc., etc. One must self - observe oneself during an attack of anger, in order to truly specify the type of anger, which invades us at any given moment. At times, anger is due to self - love or to hurt vanity. At times, anger is due to hurt pride. Anger is associated with many psychic aggregates. The angry one fails in the Great Work of the Father. It is necessary to aim the Ray of Kundalini against any psychic aggregate of anger in order to p ierce it and atomically disintegrate it. Those who do not work on themselves waste their life in sadness or in vain pleasures which leave only deceptions. Thus, their life is wasted in sighing."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 133 Those who do not work on themselves here and now, each time be come more incapable. Their interior enemies, the red demons of Seth, living personifications of their psychological defects, mock them. Those who do not work on themselves are not only full of problems, but moreover and worst of all, they are a problem for the distinct, independent parts of the Being. Every person who has the ego, the ‘I’, damages, obstructs everywhere, hurts himself and hurts others. Whosoever has ego is a problem for himself and for his friends. Any person who has the ego, the ‘I’, is lik e a ruined vessel that sails in the ocean of life, carrying his own misery. We must work on ourselves and deliver our Spirit to our Interior God. The Intimate Christ withdraws from vanity. Vanity is a charlatan by nature and when it is hurt, it thunders wi th great anger. Many are the Saints who have revested themselves with the costume of vanity. Aristipus covered himself with an old tunic, which was covered with holes and patches. He then grasped the staff of philosophy and walked on the streets of Athens. When Socrates saw him approaching, he exclaimed: “Oh Aristipus, your vanity is shown through the holes of your vesture.” Vanity and pride are use to being dangerously associated. A wealthy woman could buy an antique car from the beginning of the century, in order to have it in her home. Such eccentricity is caused by dint of pride. However, for vanity, she would prefer a fine new car, in order to drive on the streets of the city. We would accept many things because of vanity, yet, because of pride we would reject them. Anger, pride, and vanity, impede the correct inner relations with the distinct, independent parts of the Being. Our interior enemies, the red demons of Seth, take counsel in order to take our Soul away from us. What purpose would it serve to conquer all the kingdoms of the world if we lose our Soul? The Soul is laws, forces, divine virtues, powers, etc. Whosoever does not crystallize the Soul within himself, loses his Soul. We have previously stated that if the water does not boil at one hundr ed degrees, that which must be dissolved is not dissolved, and that which must be crystallized is not crystallized. If, as well, we do not pass through great emotional crises, then we cannot dissolve the psychic aggregates, nor can we crystallize the Soul. We repeat, we need to crystallize the Soul. Each time a psychic aggregate is disintegrated, a virtue, a power, or a law, etc., is crystallized. Thus, this is how we will reach the crystallization of the Soul. This is how we will possess our Soul. Even the very same body must convert itself into Soul. Whosoever loses his Soul sinks himself into the Infernal Worlds. We must work on ourselves and trust in our Intimate God.

What do the hypocr itical Pharisees know about the intimate life of the Wise? Nevertheless, the Pharisees dare to attack the Adepts of the Great Work. Never has any Pharisee believed himself to be mistaken. The Pharisees hate Christ, thus, they condemn Him each time He comes to the Earth. The Pharisees arose, have arisen and will arise in rebellion against the Lord who comes to teach them. Christ is judged by the Pharisees who believe themselves to be wise. Thus, this is how they throw stones against Him. The most critical is the ingratitude of the Pharisees. They attack Christ with the very same words and teachings that they learned from the Lord. They use the words of the Lord in order to attack the Lord. How absurd it is to judge by appearance and throw stones against Chris t. A horrible Karma will befall upon the hypocritical Pharisees. The hypocritical Pharisees devolve within the submerged mineral kingdom of the infernal worlds. The Second Death and the burning lake of fire and sulphur await the hypocritical Pharisees. The Pharisee ‘I’ exists within each person. Woe to those who do not dissolve the Pharisee ‘I’!

When the total reintegration of all the autonomous and Self - conscious parts of the Being has been achieved, then, the interior universe of each one of us has been completed. The Throne of the Intimate Christ is precisely in the Treasury of the Light. We have previously stated that we must search for the Treasury of the Light within the profundities of the Being. The Treasury of t he Light is of gold, diamonds, and all precious stones. The Treasury of the Light is the Celestial Jerusalem. The city is twelve thousand furlongs, which represent the twelve works of Hercules. The twelve works of Hercules are performed in the Ninth Sphere . The Ninth Sphere is one hundred percent sexual. The Celestial Jerusalem is the same as the Philosophical Stone. All the roads of the Celestial Jerusalem are made of pure gold. The entire city is filed with precious stones.

Babylon the Great is the psychological city that we carry within ourselves. We must previously destroy the Great Babylon , if we want to create the Celestial Jerusalem within ourselves. The precious stones symbolizing virtues, gold, the twelve pearls, etc., constitute the Treasury of the Lord, the Golden Fleece of the ancient people. Our readers must read what is written abo ut the Celestial Jerusalem in the Apocalypse of Saint John. It is urgent to build the Celestial Jerusalem within ourselves. We have the right to feed ourselves with the twelve fruits of the Tree of Life. We could not build the Celestial Jerusalem without p reviously having disintegrated the undesirable psychic aggregates, which we carry within our interior.

The Golden Reed represents the spinal column of the Adept. The Golden Reed is the Staff of Brahma, the Rod of Aaron. The twelve Saviors are the same as the twelve Light Powers. The orders of the twel ve Saviors, the process of the twelve Light - Powers must be restored in the Inheritances of each one of them.

The first level is the instinctive human being. The second level is the emotional human being. The third level is the intellectual human being. The fourth level is the equilibrated human being. The fifth level belongs to those who have built the astral body. The sixth level of human being belongs to those who have built the mental body.

These three levels of humans do not understand each other. The instinctive level does not understand the intellectual. The emotional level does not u nderstand the intellectual. The intellectual level does not understand the emotional. The three superior levels constitute the Kingdom. The inhabitants of the Kingdom have not provoked the two world wars. The humans of the fourth level are not in the circl e of the confusion of tongues. However, they are neither in the Kingdom. The humans of the fourth level never identify themselves with any particular center of the human machine. The humans of the fourth level correctly drive the five centers of the human machine. The five centers of the human machine are: Intellect, emotion, movement, instinct and sex. The two superior centers are the superior emotional and the superior mental. Only the inhabitants of the Kingdom can use these centers. Mary or Marah, the W oman - Serpent, reminds us of the Kingdom that the Intimate Christ promised to us. Those who know how to suffer with patience in their trials and work on themselves will inherit the kingdom. Obviously, the true human beings are the ones who are the inhabitan ts of the Kingdom.

The power and the Light of Christ are within Pistis Sophia. Darkness covers the oppressors, who are the undesirable psychic elements that we carry within our interior. Pistis Sophia as Power - Wisdom, must humble herself in the presence of the Intimate Christ. The red demons of Seth take the Light away from t he Initiate. They steal part of the Consciousness from the Initiate. The red demons of Seth, who are the psychic aggregates that we carry in our interior, must fall into the burning lake of fire and Sulphur. This is the Second Death. When the power of the ego has turned into dust, the emanations of Yew emerge. Yew is the illuminator, one of the Self - conscious parts of the Being. Yew develops the sense of the psychological self - observation within each one of us. Moreover, Yew can pursue and cast the red demo ns of Seth down into the Chaos. The power of the Lion of the Law is terrible and the tenebrous ones take advantage of the most difficult moments in order to embitter the life of the Initiates. The psychic aggregates oppress the power of Pistis Sophia. Yet, they will never succeed in taking the inner power away from Pistis Sophia. The power of the Lion of the Law is terrible and it intends to purify us by means of pain. Pistis Sophia wants a balsam for her painful heart. She begs for the Lion - faced to permit her to take a rest from so much bitterness. It is necessary to take the fatal light from the Self - willed ego. The darkness of the ego and of the Abyss is other types of light. We could say that it is light of the infrared gamut.

The profound Lord is always found in the Thirteenth Aeon. Nevertheless, it is necessary to know that our Inte rior Buddha is only the projection of Adhi - Buddha, the Unmanifested One. Adhi - Buddha is the Unknowable and Unmanifested Lord. Each one of us has our own Adhi - Buddha. It is not possible to know the Unmanifested Adhi - Buddha during the Great Cosmic Day. Now w e comprehend why Jesus, the Great Kabir, always spoke of Yew, the Father of his Father. We could not understand all the Mysteries of the Light if we would not know something about the Two Ones, the Manifested One and the Unmanifested One. Aelohim is the Un knowable and Unmanifested One. Elohim is the Manifested One. Moses prohibited the molding of images of Aelohim. Yet, he never prohibited the sculpting or allegorizing of the Manifested Elohim. It is impossible to symbolize or allegorize the Unknowable One. Nevertheless, the Manifested One, the Knowable Elohim, can be allegorized or symbolized. The Manifested Elohim is constituted by the Demiurge Creator of the Universe. The Sacred Fire emerges from within the womb of Aelohim. Fohat, the Fire, the intelligen t flames, emerge from within the bosom of Aelohim. The Cosmic Intelligence is the Fire, the Creators, the Ineffable Ones who emerge from within the womb of the Unknowable One in every Universe, in the beginning of the Dawn of Creation. Not a single Buddha of contemplation can integrate himself with the Adhi - Buddha before the cosmic night. The Mysteries of the Light are terrific and only Adhi - Buddha knows them completely.

The Chaos and the darkness envelop those who wish to take the Light and the power away from Pistis Sophia. The first Chaos from which the cosmos emerged is between the Sephiroth Binah and Chesed. The second Chaos, from where the fundamental princ iples of the human being emerged, exists within Yesod - Mercury, which is the sexual human centre.

Fortunate are those who will confess to the Lord and will sing praises to the Lord in the Midst of countless people. Pistis Sophia is treated unjustly and is hated without cause. All the Initiates are hated by the profane and profaners. There are many Pharisees who discourse with the Adepts with words of peace, though they secretly plot agains t them. The Adepts are usually persecuted by their own disciples. The Adepts are praised and venerated by those who later convert themselves into their accusers and persecutors. Terrible is the fate of the Adepts. Today praised, tomorrow persecuted by thei r own disciples and the day after tomorrow, loved again, etc. Certainly, the traitors exclaim: “Well indeed, our eyes have filled our sight with him, we know him, he is perverse, etc.” This is how the Adepts suffer.

Unquestionably, the Intimate Christ must grow within the Initiate. Evidently, the Lord grows in the Soul, preaches to the multitudes and teaches with His example. The Blessed One posteriorly performs the entire Cosmic Drama in the So ul and in the Spirit of the human being, as it is written in the Four Gospels.

This is the solution of the ninth repentance of Pi stis Sophia... Amen, amen, I say unto you: Ye shall be the first in the kingdom of heaven before all invisibles and all gods and rulers who are in the thirteenth aeon and in the twelfth aeon; and not only ye, but also every one who shall accomplish my mys teries.” The Kingdom of Heaven is not a place as the learned ignoramuses suppose. The Kingdom of Heaven is the conscious circle of the solar humanity, which operates over the superior centers of the Being. The Kingdom of Heaven is formed by each and every one of the members of the divine humanity. All the Invisjbles and all the Gods within ourselves, and all the Rulers from the Thirteenth Aeon and from the Twelfth Aeon, bow in the presence of James. Indeed, all the Invisibles and Gods and Rulers from the T welfth and Thirteenth Aeons, are the multiple sovereign and Self - conscious parts of our own individual Being. All those who perform the Christic Mysteries will, one day, return to the Thirteenth Aeon. The Thirteenth Aeon is Am, Sat, the Seity. Beyond the T hirteenth Aeon is the Cosmic Common Eternal Father, and Adhi Buddha, who is the Buddha of our individual Buddha. Adhi - Buddha is the Father of our Father, but He never comes into manifestation, because He is the Unknowable Divinity. Only at the end of the M ahamanvantara, after having integrated ourselves with our Father who is in secret, do we then integrate ourselves with Adhi - Buddha. This integration with Adhi - Buddha is performed in the Mahapralaya, in the Cosmic Night and within the bosom of the Absolute Abstract Space. Mary interpreteth the words of Jesus And when he had said this, he said unto them “Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you? Mary started forward again and said “Yea, O Lord, this is what thou didst say unto us aforetime: ‘The la st shall be first and the first shall be last The first then, who were created before us, are the invisibles, for indeed they arose before mankind, they and the gods and the rulers; and the men who shall receive mysteries, will be first into the kingdom of heaven.” “The last shall be first and the first shall be last.” Thus says Marah, Mary, the Woman - Serpent, the Divine Mother Kundalini."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 148 Obviously, the Invisibles who were before mankind, they and the Gods and the Rulers and the Men who shall receive Myste ries, will be the first in the Kingdom of Heaven.

Jesus is sent to help her Jesus said unto her: “well said, Mary.” Jesus continued again and said unto his disciples: “It came to pass then. when Pistis Sophia had proclaimed the ninth repentance, that the lion - faced power oppressed her again, desiring to take away all powers from her. She cried out ag ain to the Light, saying: “O Light, in whom I have had faith from the beginning, for whose sake I have endured these great pains, helps me.” “And in that hour her repentance was accepted from her. The First Mystery hearkened unto her, and I was sent off at his command. I came to help her, and led her up out of the chaos, because she had repented, and also because she had had faith in the Light and had endured these great pains and these great perils. She had been deluded through the god - like Self - willed, an d had not been deluded through anything else, save through a light power, because of its resemblance to the Light in which she had faith. For this cause then was I sent forth at the command of the First Mystery to help her secretly. I did not however yet g o to the region of the Aeons at all; but I passed down through the midst out of them, without any single power knowing it, either those of the interior of the interior or those of the exterior of the exterior, save only the First Mystery. “It came to pass then, when I came into the chaos to help her, that she saw me, that I was understanding and shone exceedingly and was full of compassion for her. For I was not Self Willed as the lion - faced power, which had taken away the light - power from Sophia, and had also oppressed her in order to take away from the whole light in her. Sophia then saw me, that I shone ten thousand times more that the lion - faced power, and that I was full of compassion for her. And she knew that I came out of the Height of heights, in w hose light she had had faith from the beginning. Pistis Sophia then took courage and uttered the tenth repentance saying:” The Lion - faced Power oppressed Pistis Sophia, desiring to take away all powers from her. It is clear that the Initiate owes many deb ts and that the power of Justice is threatening him. Nevertheless, the Intimate Christ can forgive Pistis Sophia. The Light of the lights, the Truth of the truth, the Concealed of the concealed, helps the Initiate full of Pistis Sophia. Pistis Sophia is fo rgiven in the ninth repentance. It is necessary to receive and posteriorly to attain the qualification of the eight Initiations. The Ninth Hour comes, after having passed through the eight great qualifications, which correspond to the eight Initiations. Th e secret number is known in the Ninth Hour. The Initiate then enters the Archangelic group to which he belongs."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 149 Now we explain why Pistis Sophia is forgiven in the Ninth Hour. The Army of the Voice is organized in groups, and each group has its secret numb er according to its own form of work. The First Mystery hears Pistis Sophia and under His commandment she is conduced out of the Chaos. The First Mystery is the Father, the Ancient of Days. Each one of us has his own Father. The Initiate is deluded by the ego, by the Self - willed and his downfall is due to it. The Light - Power, which resembles the primogenial Light, guides the devotee. Nevertheless, the important thing is the Light of the lights. Christ, obedient to the Father, always comes secretly to help t he Initiate. The Intimate Christ interiorly helps us. The Intimate Christ incarnates in the Initiate and helps him in the Great Work. Christ passes through the Aeons in order to come into the incarnation. The Incarnated Christ works remarkably when disinte grating the engenders of the Inferno. The Intimate Christ, in the presence of the Initiate, shines ten thousands times more than the Lions of the Law. The Interior Lord is above the Lions of the Law. The Intimate Christ descends in order to internally help Pistis Sophia. The Light of the lights, the intelligence of the intelligence, always hears the sincerely repented one. The cunning threats and the unjust, lawless lips are always conjuring against the Initiates of the rocky path, which leads towards the F inal Liberation. The Light that the Initiate has must be taken to the Father of all Lights. The tenth repentance of Sophia 1. I have cried unto thee, O Light of lights, in my oppression and thou host hearkened unto me. 2. O Light, save my power from unj ust and lawless lips and from crafty traps. 3.

Woe unto me that my dwelli ng was far off and I was in the dwellings of the chaos. 6. My power was in regions, which are not mine. 7.

The Self - willed animal ego that dwells within ourselves, and the snares of the unmerciful, lie in wait for the Initiate. Pistis Sophia’ s dwelling place is the Thirteenth Aeon. However, when she is fallen she lives in the inferior Chaos. The regions of Pistis Sophia are in the Thirteenth Aeon and never in the abysses of perdition. The tenebrous ones do not feel pity for the Initiates. On the contrary, they attack them. CHAPTER 53 When Jesus had said this unto his disciples, he said unto them Now, therefore, let him whom his spirit stirreth, come forward and speak the solution of the tenth repentance of Pistis Sophia.” Peter answered and said “O Lord, concerning this thy light - power prophesied aforetime thr ough David in the one - hundred - and - nineteenth Psalm, saying: Peter, within each one of ourselves is the part of the Being that is related with the Mysteries of sex. In the Cosmic Drama, Peter died crucified, with his head pointing downwards. The inverted cross of Peter indicates that we must work in the Ninth Sphere, sex. Mars descends into the Ninth Sphere in order to re - temper his sword, as does Hercules in order to clean the Stables of Augias, as does Perseus in order to cut the Head of Medusa with his Flaming Sword. The descent into the Ninth Sphere is the maximum ordeal for the Hierophant. Buddha, Jesus, Dante, Zaratustra, Hermes, Quezalcoatl, etc., had to pass through this terrible ordeal. For as long as this terrible ordeal is not passed, only theori es will exist in the mind. Peter interpreteth the tenth repentance from Psalm CXIX 1.

The unjust lips and the crafty tongues always calumniate the Hierophants of sex. The perverse ones can never comprehend the sexual Mysteries and vociferate against the wise. The crafty tongue that speaks of what it does not even remotely know will fall into the abyss of perdition. Those who calumniate the Hierophants of sex devolve within the womb of the Earth u ntil the second death. Speaking against the Mysteries of sex implies an attack against the Intimate Peter, who is the autonomous and Self - conscious part of our own Being related with sex. Strong is the one who strengthens himself in sexual magic. The one w ho has never worked in the Forge of the Cyclops is frightfully weak. The sexual energy is the mighty strength of all powers. Life is a desert for the Initiate. Rare is the one who can live in the desert of the Wise. The arrows of the mighty one are sharpen ed with the fire of sexual life and flaming, erotic coals. Pistis Sophia’s dwelling - place is far off from the tents of Kedar. Our beloved readers must not forget that the CXIX Psalm, cited by the Hierophant Peter, corresponds to the specific functions of o ur Intimate Peter and to the Mysteries of sex. Similarly, each one of the personages of the Pistis Sophia is one of the parts of our own Being. Obviously, each one of the twelve parts and every one of the parts of our own Being has his documentation in the sacred Scriptures. Now our readers will comprehend the reason why each one of the personages of the Pistis Sophia cites a paragraph of the Holy Bible. Therefore, Peter and the Mysteries of sex are not an exception. Our readers are advised about the existi ng intimate relation between the personages of Pistis Sophia and the Biblical paragraphs cited by them. Obviously, the Biblical paragraphs cited by them specify the functions of each one of them in ourselves and within ourselves, here and now. Pistis Sophi a is certainly not a book to be mechanically read, but should be studied and profoundly meditated upon, during the entire lifetime. The CXIX Psalm, cited by Peter, continues saying: “My soul has dwelt in many regions as a guest.” This invites us to meditat e. The Great Kabir Jesus said : “In my Father’s house are many mansions.” The adulterers and fornicators will fall into the infernal worlds where only weeping and the gnashing of teeth are heard. We must distinguish between a downfall and a descent. The one who wishes to ascend must first of all descend. No one can ascend without previously having taken the trouble to descend.

The Sulphur and the Mercury open the doors of the distinct regions of the Universe. The Sulphur and the Mercury, although they are opposites, become conciliated by the virtue of the sublimed Salt. The Sulphur and the Mercury are the parents of t he Philosophical Stone. The red demons of Seth hate peace. They are the ones who fight against the Being without a cause. The psychic aggregates and the Lion of the Law always oppress Pistis Sophia exceedingly. Peter, the Hierophant of sex, always gives th e solution of the repentance of Pistis Sophia. The true repentance of the Soul has a sexual foundation. Jesus commendeth Peter Jesus said unto him. “Well said, Peter, and finely. This is the solution of the tenth repentance of Pistis Sophia.” CHAPTER 54 Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: “It came to pass then, when this lion - faced power saw me, how I drew nigh unto Pistis Sophia, shining very exceedingly, that it grew still more furious and emanated from itself a multitu de of exceedingly violent emanations.

And they will see thee and will rejoice over thee and say: Lo, an emanation which hath not given the purification of its light, so that it may be saved, but boasted itself in the abundance of the light of its power, because it did not emanate from the power in it, and hath said: I wilt take away the light from Pistis Sophia, which will now be taken from it.’ “Now, therefore, let him in whom his power is raised, come forward and proclaim the so lution of the eleventh repentance of Pistis Sophia.” The Mighty Power has always raised itself up in evil, because evil fortifies it against its will. The sharp iron takes away the power from Pistis Sophia under the tenebrous plot of the Averno. The regio n of Virtuousness is ineffable, yet Pistis Sophia descends into the inferior Chaos in order to transform herself and victoriously re - ascend. The Theomertmalogos was altered in the Dawn of the Mahamanvantara, by a contact of the Geneotriamatzikamnian type. This signifies that the sublime Theomertmalogos suffered a certain alteration when it made contact with the primogenial manifestation of the Cosmos. Similarly, Pistis Sophia passes through a certain transformation when she makes contact with the inferior C haos. The tenebrous ones within the Chaos always want to consume all the light of Pistis Sophia. The Light will take away from the tenebrous ones their negative and fatal light. The matter of the tenebrous ones will be reduced to dust. This is the Second D eath. The tenebrous ones will never ascend to the Thirteenth Aeon. There exist the Rulers of the Light and the Tenebrous Rulers. The Rulers of the Light have their name written in the Great Book of Life. Yet, the Tenebrous Rulers shall not have their name written in the Great Book of Life. The four - and - twenty Emanations are the twenty - four Elders, who are the living personification of the Microcosmic Zodiac within ourselves. The twenty - four Elders, or twenty - four autonomous and Self - conscious parts of our o wn Being, will see what has befallen in front of the Lion of the Law. Thus, they will be afraid and will not be disobedient, but will give the purification of their Light. A divine, ineffable purification irradiates from their Light. The emanation that doe s not give the purification of its Light can never be saved. Each part of our own Being must be perfected. The perfection of each part is possible only with the elimination of the undesirable psychic elements. The most elevated parts of the Being are deman ding. Therefore, no one can perfect them without having eliminated the totality of the undesirable psychic elements."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 154 The one who perfects the most elevated parts of the Being receives the degree of Ishmech. If the emanation, or the part of the Being does n ot give its Light of perfection, it is because it remains bottled up within a psychic aggregate It is obvious that when any part of the Being is bottled up, it boasts of itself, it becomes egotistical. It is a crime to boast about the power and the Light, which does not emanate from ourselves, but from the Being. The Light and the real Wisdom emanates from the Being of the Being, not exclusively from some of the parts. Any part of the Being which is bottled up in one or another psychic aggregate, living per sonification of a psychological defect, intends to boast of itself and believe itself to be sovereign. Those who pretend to have the totality of the light of Pistis Sophia ignore that they ignore, Salome interpreteth the repentance from Psalm LI Then Sal ome came forward and said: “My Lord, concerning this thy light - power prophesied aforetime through David in the fifty - first Psalm, saying: 1. Why doth the mighty [one] boast himself in his wickedness? 2. Thy tongue hath studied unrighteousness all the day long; as a sharp razor hast thou practiced craft. 3.

White thy light - power hath roused me, I have spoken it according to thy desire.” Psalm LI specifies the functions of Salome within ourselves, here and now. Obviously, none of the personages of Pistis Sophia are outside of ourselves. Unquestionably, all the personages of Pistis Sophia are autonomous and Sel f - conscious parts of our own Being. With the Olooestesnokhnian type of vision, the Being appears like an Army of Children. This is how we, the ‘Brethren on Service’, perceive Him. An entire Hooltampanas of the Universe can be perceived with this vision. An entire Hooltampanas is equivalent to 5,764,801 tonalities of the universal cosmic color. No one can possess this type of sight of the sacred Olooestesnokhnian without having previously passed through the Buddhist Annihilation. Salome as virtue and virtues , law and laws, knows very well why the mighty (one) boasts and vaunts himself in his wickedness. The tongue of the perverse one becomes like a sharp razor for evil. The perverse one loves evil, for the love of the same evil. The lying words and crafty ton gue characterizes the perverse one. Salome knows good from evil and evil from good. Each part of our own Being has his sacred ministry. Above and below, in the Macrocosm and in the Microcosmic human being, the creative powers are esoterically divided into seven, three, and four, within the twelve great cosmic orders, which bring to mind the zodiacal signs in the Macrocosm and in the Microcosm. The Lions of Fire, or ‘Lions of Life’ of the zodiacal sign of Leo, are constituted as the most elevated group in th e Macrocosm and within the Microcosmic human being. Moreover, it is important to remember that just as the zodiacal belt exists in the firmament, likewise, the flames of the constellation of Leo exist within the human being. The Hierarchy of the Fire is th e most important Hierarchy in the Macrocosm and in the Microcosmic human being. Following these short paragraphs, which are necessary in order to clarify concepts, let us continue with the biblical verses cited by Salome and their corresponding commentary. God abandons the one who marches on the path of perdition. When the son falls, then the Father withdraws. When the Father withdraws, then the son falls in disgrace. The one who does not trust in the help of God, but in his material wealth and who has deve loped the psychic aggregate of vanity, falls into the abyss of perdition. The aggregate or psychic aggregate of vanity impedes the correct relation with the superior parts of the Being. Vanity is a relative of pride. Vanity is a charlatan. Pride is silent. Someone will speak about certain things because of vanity, yet, will keep silent about them because of pride. By dint of pride, any wealthy person could have in his residence an antique car, possibly from the last century. However, because of vanity, this person would prefer to drive a car of the latest model."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 156 Hurt vanity causes frightful suffering.

The emanations of the prince of this world are the red demons of Seth. The matter of the prince of this world must remain without any light in it. The emanations of the prince of this world fall into the inferior chaos. The lights, or percentages of Essence, which are bottled up within the ego, must be liberated by means of the annihilation of each part of the ego or ‘I’. The Divine Mother Kundalini must purify all li ght and take it from within each psychic aggregate. In the Infernal Worlds, the Rulers watch the tenebrous ones and do not permit them to leave from the abode of Pluto. Similarly, within each one of ourselves, the Rulers, the superior parts of our Being mu st watch over their emanations, which are the red demons of Seth. The Essence, which is bottled up within the tenebrous ones, can only escape from within them through their supreme death. The power of the demons in the Chaos must be annulled little by litt le. The light which is enclosed within the red demons of Seth must be taken away from them in a revolutionary manner. The names of the lost ones are erased in the thirteenth Aeon. The Lion of the Law projects the guilt in front of itself in order for it to be known and never erases iniquities from the one who has produced them. Karma disappears only by patient destruction of psychic aggregates, and through forgiveness, or negotiation. Nevertheless, the projected guilt continues in the Akasa as a movie, unti l we annihilate the Teleoginooras films. Guilt is always visible and tangible in the Teleoginooras films. The tenebrous ones must live in the inferior Chaos. They are not permitted to look beyond the abode of Pluto. The red demons of Seth have spared no on e, but have oppressed every one whose Light and power they have taken away. The tenebrous ones always desire to take away the light from Pistis Sophia. The perverse ones defend the inferior Chaos. Therefore, let them continue to abide in the Tartarus. The tenebrous ones never desire the abode of Virtuousness. This is why they continue to dwell in the womb of the Averno."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 160 “Demonius Est Deus Inversus” The Demon is God, but inverted. The Inferno is the womb of Heaven. The other face of God is in the Averno. The Averno is the shadow of light. The Light of lights must save us with the Mystery of His name and the power of His grace. Pistis Sophia cannot stand until she passes through the Buddhist Annihilation. Newness comes only through death. If the germ does not die, the plant is not born. The fallen Initiate suffers the unspeakable. The power of the Initiates decrease when they do not possess Mystery, which means, when they do not work in the Ninth Sphere (sex). The Misterium Magnum of the Universe resides in its seed, in its iliaster, and specifically in its Limbus Magnum. The Misterium of the tree resides in its germ. The Misterium of a human resides in his seed. Whosoever does not work with the Misterium Magnum falls in the Great Work. The Initiate who does not have a Hermetic Glass must attain one in order to work in the Mysteries. Understand that the Hermetic Glass is the feminine Yoni. The Mysteries of Lingam - Yoni must be cultivated in secret. The laws of the number six teach that when an Alchemist does not p ossess a Hermetic Glass in good condition, then he must search for another one that will be in a perfect state, in order to work in the laboratory. Nevertheless, not a single Alchemist can successfully use a Hermetic Glass without the will of the Father, w ho is in secret. The Misterium Magnum of sex is terribly divine. Many are the learned ignoramuses who do not know the rules and procedures of the Sixth Arcanum. The Pharisee ‘I’ of the learned ignoramuses who do not know the rules and procedures of the Six th Arcanum, calumniate and condemn the Alchemist who takes a new Hermetic Glass. The profane and profaners ignore the Mysteries of the Sixth Arcanum. Foolish are the Adepts who renounce their laboratory work by obeying the learned ignoramuses. The Adepts w ho are bottled up within moral prejudice and ethic codes renounce the use of a Hermetic Glass. Thus, they fail in the Great Work. A destroyed Hermetic Glass does not serve for the laboratory work. The human matter of Pistis Sophia inevitably languishes bec ause of the lack of light. An Alchemist who abdicates to the sexual Mysteries of Lingam - Yoni, as a fact, resigns from being an Alchemist. Therefore, such a one falls. The tenebrous ones mock the sexual abstainers by nodding their heads. Sexual abstinence o riginates terribly perverse malignant Poisoniooskirian vibrations. The Poisoniooskirian vibrations are terribly malignant. The Poisoniooskirian vibrations originate the development of the abominable Kundartiguador organ."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 161 The abominable Kundartiguador organ is the sexual fire directed from the coccygeal bone downwards, towards the atomic infernos of the human being. The abominable Kundartiguador organ is the tail of Satan, the tempting serpent of Eden, the horrible Python serpent that slithered in the mud of the earth and that the irritated Apollo hurt with his darts. The tempting serpent is the antithesis of the serpent of brass, which is entwined in the generator Lingam. Moses healed the Israelites in the wilderness, with the marvelous power of the serpent of brass. Yet, the tempting serpent of Eden has this painful humanity submerged in a fatal, collective, hypnotic state. The serpent of brass, the serpent that is entwined on the rod of Sculapius, God of Medicine, must awaken us, must take us away from the collective hypnotic state. Let us then distinguish between Kundalini and Kundartiguador, between the serpent that ascends and the one that descends. We must never commit the error of attributing all the left and tenebrous powers of the descending serpent ( Kundartiguador), to the serpent (Kundalini) that ascends through the medullar spinal canal of the human being. Only the one who is prepared can understand the twelfth repentance of Pistis Sophia. Andrew, within us, is the autonomous and Self - conscious part of our own Being, who is occupied with the three factors of the revolution of the Consciousness. These three factors are: To be born, to die, and to sacrifice the self for humanity. The Cross of Saint Andrew is accustomed to being terribly painful. The Me rcury and the Sulphur must incessantly cross if we long to continue the performance of the Great Work. The sufferings of the Initiate, crucified on the Cross of Andrew, are inexpressible. It is not possible to purify and perfect the Mercurial Bodies, if we renounce the disintegration of the Dry Mercury. The Dry Mercury is crystallized as the psychic aggregates, living personifications of our psychological defects. The disintegration of the psychic aggregates is possible only through conscious works and volu ntary sufferings. There is the need to pass through great emotional crises and intentional sufferings if, truly, we want to atomically disintegrate our psychological defects. Now, we can better comprehend the inexpressible suffering of our Interior Andrew. “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.” The supreme repentance, necessary in order to disintegrate any psychic aggregates, demands cries and remorse. It is not possible to disintegrate psychic aggregates without tears, repentance and s upreme pain. To comprehend Andrew, without the transmutatory science of ‘Yesod - Mercury’, and without the disintegration of the undesirable psychic elements that we carry in our interior, would be impossible. Egoic perforation and egoic disintegration is pe rformed within the Flaming Forge of Vulcan. The supreme sacrifice of the Interior Andrew is urgent, non - delayable and unpostponable."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 162 The Alchemist who does not sacrifice himself for humanity will never become a Boddhisattwa. Only the Boddhisattwas with com passionate heart, who have given their life for humanity, can incarnate the Intimate Christ. We must make a complete differentiation between the Sravakas and Buddhas Pratyekas on one side, and Boddhisattwas on the other. The Sravakas and Buddhas Pratyekas only preoccupy themselves with their particular perfection, without caring a bit for this poor suffering humanity. Obviously, the Buddhas Pratyekas and Sravakas can never incarnate Christ. Only the Boddhisattwas who sacrifice themselves for humanity can in carnate Christ. The sacred title of Boddhisattwa is legitimately attained, only by those who have renounced to all Nirvanic happiness for the love of the suffering humanity. Obviously, before the Boddhisattwa is born, the Bodhisitta must be formed within o urselves. Furthermore, it is important to clarify the necessity of disintegrating the ego, the ‘I’, in order for the Bodhisitta to emerge. The Bodhisitta is formed with the merits of love and supreme sacrifice for our fellowmen. The Boddhisattwa is formed within the environment and psychological atmosphere of the Bodhisitta. We must not mistake the Bodhisitta with the Boddhisattwa. The Bodhisitta is the awakened and developed superlative Consciousness Of the Being. The Bodhisitta emerges in the aspirant who sacrifices himself for his fellowmen; long before the Mercurial bodies have been created. We could never convert ourselves into Boddhisattwas without the complete work of the Interior Andrew. Any one can be an Sravaka or a Buddha Pratyeka with his Mercuri al bodies, but this is not sufficient in order to be a Boddhisattwa. Only those who have sacrificed themselves for the planetary humanities, through distinct Mahamanvantaras, deserve to be called Boddhisattwas. H. P. B. conventionally referred to Boddhisat twa as those who possess the superior existential bodies of the Being, or better said, Mercurial bodies. However, in strict Orthodox Buddhism, only those who have the Bodhisitta in themselves and who have renounced to all Nirvanic happiness for the love of humanity can qualify themselves as Boddhisattwas. The Cross of Saint Andrew has the form of an ‘X’, which is the extraordinary hieroglyph of the luminous and divergent radiations that emerge from the Creator Logos. The rose, symbol of the Solar Logos, shi nes in the center of the Cross of Saint Andrew. The Cross of Saint Andrew symbolizes illumination...revelation, after frightful sacrifices. The Greek Cross and the Cross of Saint Andrew have the same significance in Hermetic science. It is not irrelevant t o remember that the vertical ‘phallus’ within the formal ‘cteis’, forms a Cross. Phallus - uterus, when connected, forms a Cross. Nevertheless, the Cross as an ‘X’ indicates the complete work in the Great Work. The Work will have victoriously concluded, if t he Rose shines on the Cross of Saint Andrew."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 163 The perverse ones use their tongues in order to discredit the Initiates.

The purpose of profound interior meditation is to obtain true tranquility. It could not be possible to obtain the peace of the tranquil heart, as long as the psychological factors of non - tranquility exist within oursel ves. We explore the psychological ‘I’ during profound interior meditation. During profound interior meditation we propose only to integrally comprehend the psychological defect discovered in self - observation. Each self - observed defect must be previously co mprehended through meditation, before proceeding with its elimination. Prayer and sexual magic are indispensable for the elimination.

Thus, by eliminating the factors of non - tranquility, we will attain complete tranquility. Only the tranquil heart can reach illumination an d omniscience. When the Boddhisattwa reaches illumination, then he prepares himself for omniscience. It is not possible to reach omniscience unless we previously learn to live between the absolute and the relative, between the mutable and immutable. Those who have passed beyond the illuminated Void and the relativity of life, experience that which is called Tality. The Tality is the Great Reality of life, free in its movement. Only those who can willfully experience Tality receive the power of omniscience. No one can reach omniscience without having reached the true reality of the tranquil heart. There is a need to shake out and eliminate the psychic aggregates, as grasshoppers. The knees of those who have ego tremble and their flesh is altered from lack of oil.

It is urgent to cease to exist wi thin the heresy of separatism or in the joy of the illuminated Void. It is unpostponable to Self - realize within ourselves that which is called Tality. The Tality is the Great Reality beyond perversity and holiness. The saints can never exist within the wom b of the Tality, which is beyond perversity and holiness. There is nothing in the Tality, which can be called holy. The Great Reality is the Great Reality, the Tality. The saints and the perverse ones revolve within the great Wheel of Samsara. Therefore, t hey are very far from the Tality. Nevertheless, we must be very careful with the psychic aggregate of self - merits. The psychic aggregate of self - merits causes us to be newly born in Heaven or on Earth. The psychic aggregate of self - merits removes us far aw ay from the Tality. We never obtain real merits, because the one who performs the entire true work is the Father. The first principle of the Gnostic Doctrine is the Tality or Great Reality.

Now, therefore, O Light of lights, forgi ve me my transgression, for it is exceedingly great, because I have abandoned the regions of the height and have come to dwell in the regions of the chaos. When then Pistis Sophia had said this, she continued again in the thirteenth repentance, saying: Ch rist is the Light of lights. He, Himself, is one with the Father. The Intimate Christ, or Christus - Vishnu, is the Light of lights. The Light of lights is: Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva; Father, Son, Holy Spirit. The Twelve Repentances of Pistis Sophia are related with the Twelve Hours of Apollonius, the Twelve Works of Hercules, and the Twelve Aeons. In these Twelve Repentances, the qualification of the Eight Great Initiations of the Fire take place, as well as four more works following the Resurrection of the Inti mate Christ within the Boddhisattwa. It is clear that every fallen Boddhisattwa descends from the Thirteenth Aeon and falls into the Chaos. Undoubtedly, Pistis Sophia must work in the Chaos, in order to reascend to the Thirteenth Aeon. The Thirteenth Repen tance of Pistis Sophia belongs to the Thirteenth Aeon. Unquestionably, the Initiate must work in each one of the Thirteen Aeons, if he wants the Final Liberation. The First Aeon is Malkuth, which is here and in the submerged Abyss. The Second Aeon is Yesod , which is in our sexual organs and in the fourth dimension, within which is the Terrestrial Paradise, the Ethereal World. The Third Aeon is the Astral World, the Sephira Hod. The Fourth Aeon is Netzach, the Mental World. The Fifth Aeon is Tiphereth, the C ausal World. The Sixth Aeon is Geburah, the Buddhic or Intuitional World. The Seventh Aeon is the World of Atman, the Ineffable one, the region of Chesed or Gedulah. The Eight Aeon is Binah, the region of the Holy Spirit, the World of Shiva, the Third Logo s. The Ninth Aeon is Chokmah, the region of the Logos, the Cosmic Christ. The Tenth Aeon is Kether, the Region of the Ancient of Days. The Eleventh Aeon is the Region of Ain Soph Aur, the Third Great Aspect of the Absolute. The Twelfth Aeon is the region o f Ain Soph, the Second Aspect of the Absolute. The Thirteenth Aeon is the region of the Am, the Unmanifested Absolute.

Only thus can the Mystery of the Light be perfected within ourselves. The Baptism is a pact of sexual magic. If someone receives the Baptism and does not fulfill the pact, then this one fails completely. Only the Intimate Christ can forgive sins. The Lord also grants this power to the Woman Serpent. The Lion - faced Power is the Law of Karma in action, punishing Pistis Sophia. Karma m ust be paid, not only for the evil that is done, but also for the good that should have been done, yet was left undone. The Lion of the Law is fought with the Scale.

We must liberate and emancipate ourselves from the Law of Causality. We can make the great jump only by awakening and developing the Consciousness. It is necessary for the Boddhisitta, which means the auric embryo, the awakened Cons ciousness, to fall into the Illuminated Void. Only thus can the Boddhisitta be free from the world of relativity. The world of relativity is the world of combinations and of duality. The universal machine of relativity is based on the Law of Cosmic Causali ty. The Law of Cosmic Causality is the same as the Law of Karma. The Law of Causality is the same as the Law of Action and Consequence. We can submerge ourselves in the illuminated Void by means of the Great Jump. Thus, and only thus, can we liberate ourse lves from the Law of Karma. The world of relativity is based on constant dualism and therefore, on the chain of causes and effects. We must break chains in order to submerge ourselves within the Illuminated Void. The illuminated Void is obviously just the antechamber of the Tality, which is the Great Reality. The path that leads to the Great Reality is absolutely sexual. Many degrees of intuition exist. However, the highest degree is only for the mystic or religious philosophers. Only such people with Prajn a - Paramita intuition can experience the Tality.

Those who have knocked on the eleventh gate have come close to losing their life. Many have perished at the eleventh gate. Very rare are those who reach the Thirteenth Aeon. High and low regions exist in t he inferior Chaos or in the sexual Chaos. Because the work is performed in the Chaos, there is the need to ascend. We can ascend only with the help of the Intimate Christ and by means of the Light - Power. The command of the First Mystery always arrives to the elevated regions of the Chaos.

Salome interpreteth the song of Sophia from the Odes of Solomon 1. I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, for thou art my God. 2. Abandon me not, O Lord, for thou art my hope. 3. Thou hast given me thy vindication for naught, and I am saved through thee. 4. Let them who pursue me, fall down and let them not see me. 5. May a smoke - cloud cover their eyes and an air - mist darken them, and let them not see t he day, so that they may not seize me. 6. May their resolution be impotent, and may what they concoct come upon them. 7. They have devised a resolution, and it hath not taken effect for them. 8. And they are vanquished, although they are mighty, and wha t they have wickedly prepared is fallen upon them. 9. My hope is in the Lord, and I shall not be afraid, for thou art my God, my Savior.” It came to pass then, when Salome had finished saying these words, that Jesus said unto her: “Well said, Salome: and finely. This is the solution of the Words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered” The force of gratitude causes the plant to germinate in the orchard of the Gnostic Ascetic. The force of gratitude causes the plant to bear fruit."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 173 The force of cosmic gratitude m akes the universal life fertile. In some Way, we must express our gratitude to the Creator. Our Intimate God deserves our eternal gratitude. All our hope is concerned in the Intimate Christ. The one who works on himself has hope in the Intimate Christ. Onl y the Intimate Christ can give us revindication and save us. Great is the work of the Intimate Christ, working in and within us, with immense sacrifice. This is the nature of the Salvatur Salvandus. May the inhuman elements, which we carry within and which pursue us as an evil shade, fall down. May the tenebrous elements submerge themselves within the darkness of the Abyss. These are our elements. These are the living personifications of oneself. May all the concoctions of those perverse ones who dwell with in ourselves fall upon them. They are the red demons of Seth, the perverse ones and subjective parts of the abominable ego. May all that which the red demons of Seth have wickedly prepared fall upon them. Hope is in the Intimate Christ, in the Martyr of Ca lvary, who must live the complete Cosmic Drama within the Boddhisattwa. The Cosmic Drama is never exclusively historic. This Drama is palpitating actuality and the Intimate Christ must live it within ourselves, here and now. The processes of the Cosmic Dra ma are written within the Four Gospels of the Lord. CHAPTER 59 The power sent by Jesus formeth a light - wreath on Sophia’s head And Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: “It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had finished saying these words in the chaos, that I made the light - power, which I had sent to save her, become a light - wreath on her head, so that from now on the emanations of Self - willed could not have dominion over her. And when it had become a light - wreath round her head, all the evil matters in her were shaken and all were purified in her. They perished and remained in the chaos, while the emanations of Self - willed gazed upon them and rejoiced. And the purification of the pure light, which was in Pistis Sophia, g ave power to the light of my light - power, which had become a wreath round her head. “It came to pass then moreover, when it surrounded the pure light in Sophia, and her pure light did not depart from the wreath of the power of the light - flame, so that the emanations of Self - willed should not rob it from it, -- when then this befell her, the pure light - power in Sophia began to sing praises. And she praised my light - power, which was a wreath round her head, and she sang praises saying: The Light - Power of th e Intimate Christ is found in the christonic substance of the Solar Logos."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 174 This marvelous substance is the sacred sperm. The Crown of the Saints, the Church of Laodicea, shines on the head of the Christified Ones. The evil matters are disintegrated when th e light - wreath of the Saints shines on the head of Pistis Sophia. The evil matters are disintegrated in the Chaos. The ego, the emanations of the Self - willed, the demons, condemn Pistis Sophia to death and this sentence is completely fulfilled. It is worth while that the tenebrous ones condemn the Initiate to death. The tenebrous ones rejoice when the ego dies. It is obvious that the tenebrous ones feel satisfaction when the sentence of the black lodge is fulfilled. The tribunals of the tenebrous fraternity condemn the Initiate to death. The light of Pistis Sophia must purify itself in order to give power to the light of the Light - Power that converts itself into a light - wreath around the head of the Initiate. The light - wreath of the Intimate Christ becomes on e with the pure light of Pistis Sophia, then it is gold and flame. The red demons of Seth can do nothing against the gold and the flame. The light of the Initiate and the light of the Intimate Christ are truly the gold and the flame, inseparable and eterna l. Sophia sings praises to the Intimate Christ. Sophia uttereth another song of praise 1. The Light hath become a wreath round my head; and I shall not depart from it, so that the emanations of Self - willed may not rob it from me. 2. And though all the m atters are shaken, yet shall I not be shaken. 3. And though all my matters perish and remain in the chaos, -- those which the emanations of Self willed see, -- yet shall I not perish... 4. For the Light is with me, and I myself am with the Light. “These words then Pistis Sophia uttered. Now, therefore, let him who understandeth the thought of these words, come forward and proclaim their solution.” The light of the Intimate Christ and the light of Pistis Sophia form one single, integral and perfect light . The multiple undesirable elements of the terrestrial psyche shall not steal the light from Pistis Sophia. The Christie Wreath upon the head of the Ineffable Beings can never be stolen. The Christic Wreath upon the head of the Wise is found intimately rel ated with the pineal gland. The Lotus of one thousand petals, the chakra Sahasrara, the Diamond Eye is found where the pineal gland is situated."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 175 Nevertheless, we must remember that the center of intuition, related with the pineal gland, becomes illuminated with Christification. The pineal gland and the pituitary gland are united by means of a nerve fiber canal, which disappears in the corpse. The sense of psychological self - observation is located in the pituitary gland. The marvelous auras of the pituitary and pineal glands gloriously shine, illuminated and integrated upon the head of the Christified ones. All of the inhuman matters can be shaken. Yet, Christified Pistis Sophia shall not be shaken. The psychic aggregates will obviously perish in the Chaos. O bviously, the aggregates will perish in the Chaos. Some aggregates of the Chaos are only Kabbalistic bark. The corpses of the Abyss, which are without Essence, are bark. The corpses or matters of the Chaos are slowly disintegrating. The Divine Mother Kunda lini usually extracts the Essence from within one or another psychic aggregate. When the Essence is extracted, the psychic aggregate converts itself into a corpse of the Chaos. These cases are an exception, because normally, the Divine Mother Kundalini slo wly disintegrates the psychic aggregates before extracting the Essence. The Light of Christ is within Sophia and she is within Him. Mary, his mother, asketh and receiveth permission to speak. Then Mary, the mother of Jesus, come forward and said: “My son according to the world, My God and Saviour according to the height, bid me proclaim the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered.” And Jesus answered and said “Thou also, Mary, host received form which is in Barbelo, according to matter, and host received likeness which is in the Virgin of Light, according to light, thou and the other Mary, the blessed one and on thy account the darkness hath arisen, and moreover out of thee did come forth the material body in which I am, which I have purifie d and refined, - now, therefore, I bid thee proclaim the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered” And Mary, the mother of Jesus, answered and said: “My Lord, thy light - power hath prophesied aforetime concerning these words through Solomon in the nineteenth Ode and said: The Woman - Serpent, Isis, Rea, Cibeles, Adonia, Diana, Marah, Tonantzin, etc., is the Mother of Christ. Nonetheless, She is the daughter of Her Son. The Woman - Serpent is Mother of the Lord, according to the world and the Lord is Her God and Saviour, according to the height. The abode of Barbelo is the ocean of the Uncreated Light. The likeness, which the Divine Mother Kundalini has received, according to Light, is that likeness which is in the Virgin of Light. The Virgin of Lig ht, according to Light, is the Unmanifested Cosmic Mother, whose veil no mortal has lifted.

Very rare are those who gain entry into the Temple of the Unmanifested Cosmic Mot her. For this, we must pass through the complete Buddhist Annihilation. Only those who possess the Dharmakaya body, the Law - body, the body, which is Substance - Being, can enter into the Temple of the Unmanifested Cosmic Mother. The darkness has arisen by th e work of the Woman - Serpent. The three Marys are fundamental in Gnosis: Isis Mary, Mary in Nature and the Unmanifested Cosmic Mother Christ shines upon the head of Pistis Sophia. Mary, Mother of Jesus, receives form, which is in Barbelo, according to Natur e, yet she receives likeness, which is in the Virgin of Light. The Terrestrial Mary and the other Mary, the Blessed One, shine in their essential quality. Thus, thanks to the Woman - Serpent, thanks to Her the darkness has arisen, The material body of Jesus, the body that was purified and refined comes forth from the terrestrial Mother. Mary, his mother, interpreteth the song of Sophia from the XIXth ode of Solomon 1. The Lord is on my head as a wreath..., and I shall not depart from him. 2. The wreath in t ruth is woven for me; and it hath caused thy twigs to sprout in me. 3. For it is not like unto a wreath withered that sprouted not. But thou art alive on my head and thou hast sprouted upon me. 4. Thy fruits are full and perfect, filled with thy salvatio n. Pistis Sophia rejoices with the crown of Light. She knows what is the flourishing staff of the Adept. The staff of the one who has raised the serpent flourishes. You know this. The withered wreath is an evident sign of downfall. No buds will sprout fro m it. The Lord lives within Pistis Sophia when she has been forgiven, Truly, Sophia frightfully suffers when she wishes to rise up. The fruits of the Lord are plethoric and perfect. Jesus commendeth his mother It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard h is mother Mary say these words that he said unto her: “Well said, finely, Amen, amen, I say unto thee: They shall proclaim thee blessed from one end of the earth to the other; for the pledge of the First Mystery hath taken up its abode with thee, and throu gh that pledge shall all from the earth and all from the height be saved, and that pledge is the beginning and the end” Marah, the Woman - Serpent, is always blessed. The pledge of the First Mystery is maintained with Her."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 177 All is maintained with the Woman - S erpent, through the pledges of the First Mystery. It is obvious that the Divine Mother Kundalini works by the will of the Father. CHAPTER 60 The commandment of the First Mystery is fulfilled for taking Sophia entirely out of the chaos. And Jesus continu ed again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: “It came to pass when Pistis Sophia had uttered the thirteenth repentance, -- in that hour was fulfilled the commandment of all the tribulations which were decreed for Pistis Sophia for the fulfillment of the First Mystery, which was from the beginning, and the time had come to save her out of the chaos and lead her out from all the darkness. For her repentance was accepted from her through the First Mystery; and that mystery sent me a great light - powe r out of the height, that I might help Pistis Sophia and lead her up out of the chaos. So I looked towards the Aeons into the height and saw that light - power, which the First Mystery had sent me that I might save Pistis Sophia out of the chaos. The Thirte enth Repentance corresponds to the Thirteenth Aeon. Truly, thirteen are the Aeons and thirteen are the repentances. Receiving the Eight Initiations is one thing and qualifying them is another and very different thing. Beyond the eight qualifying Initiation s, five more works follow. The Twelve Works of Hercules, situated in twelve levels of the Being, are spoken of. However, the thirteenth level also exists. When Pistis Sophia reaches the Thirteenth Aeon, she is liberated. Pistis Sophia is lead out from all the darknesses by the fulfillment of the First Mystery, which is contained in the Will of the Father. The commandment of all the tribulations, which were decreed for Pistis Sophia, is fulfilled only in the Thirteenth Aeon. The repentance of the Initiate is integrally accepted only through the First Mystery. The Intimate Christ receives the Light - Power from the Ancient of Days. By means of this Light - Power, he can help the Initiate and lead him up out of the Chaos. The Lord looks towards the Light - Power, whi ch the Father has sent Him and He proceeds to save Pistis Sophia. The First Mystery and Jesus sent forth two light - powers to help Sophia It came to pass, therefore, when I had seen it, coming forth from the Aeons and hastening down to me, - I was above t he chaos, -- that another light - power went forth out of me, that it too might help Pistis Sophia. And the light - power which had come from the height through the First Mystery, came down upon the light - power which had gone out of me; and they met together a nd became a great stream of light.” When then Jesus had said this unto his disciples, he said: “Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?”"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 178 The Light - Power of the Father is integrated with the Light - Power of the Christ. A light - stream is formed w hen the Light - Power of the Father is integrally united with the Light - Power of the Christ. Mary Magdalene interpreteth the mystery from Psalm LXXXIV Mary started forward again and said: “My Lord, I understand what thou sayest. Concerning the solution of this word thy light - power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the eighty - fourth Psalm, saying: 10. Grace and truth met together, and virtue and peace kissed each other. 11. Truth sprouted forth out of the earth, and virtue looked down from heaven. ” ‘Grace’ then is the light - power which hath come down through the First Mystery; for the First Mystery hath hearkened unto Pistis Sophia and hath had mercy on her in all her tribulations. Truth’ on the other hand is in the power which hath gone forth out of thee, for that thou hast fulfilled the truth, in order to save her out of the chaos. And ‘virtue’ again is the power, which hath come forth through the First Mystery, which will guide Pistis Sophia. And ‘peace’ again is the power which hath gone forth out of thee, so that it should enter into the emanations of Self - willed and take from them the lights which they have taken away from Pistis Sophia, -- that is, so that thou mayest gather them together into Pistis Sophia and make them at peace with her pow er. ‘Truth’ on the other hand is the power, which went forth out of thee, when thou wast in the lower regions of the chaos. For this cause thy power hath said through David: Truth sprouted out of the earth,’ because thou wert in the lower regions of the ch aos. Virtue’ on the other hand which hath ‘looked down from heaven,’ -- it is the power which hath come down from the height through the First Mystery and hath entered into Pistis Sophia.” Grace and Truth meet together. Virtue and Peace are eternally kiss ing. Virtue is derived from the syllable VIR, virility. Sexual virility is urgent in order for the virtues to be born within ourselves. Sexual potency, virility, is needed in order to work in the Ninth Sphere. We must disintegrate the psychic aggregates in the Flaming Forge of Vulcan. Devi Kundalini Shakti assists us in the Ninth Sphere. Each time we disintegrate a psychic aggregate with virility, a new virtue is born in its place, within us. Virtue and Peace kiss each other, because the virtues are born wi th the disintegration of the ego, and fundamental peace arrives. Truth comes to us when the ego has died. The ego dies only by descending to the subterranean Tartarus. The one who wants to ascend must first of all descend. Every exaltation is preceded by a frightful and terrible humiliation. Therefore, the Truth must be attained from below, by working in the Ninth Sphere. Virtue comes from heaven each time that an undesirable psychic element is disintegrated."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 179 Grace is the Light - Power, which is known only by the one who receives it. This Light - Power comes by the will of the First Mystery. The First Mystery is the Merciful One, the Mercy of the Mercy, who always takes pity on the Initiate. The First Mystery is the Ancient of Days, here and now. Fortunate is th e one who receives the Light - Power that comes from the Father. Grace is the Light - Power. A conceited, vain, or proud person cannot consciously know how to take advantage of the Grace, the Light - Power that comes from the Father. Thus, before receiving the G race of the Ancient of Centuries, we must disintegrate the psychic aggregates of mystical pride, mystical conceit and mystical vanity. Let us then make a complete differentiation between mystical prides, mystical conceit and mystical vanity, and the common and current pride, conceit, and vanity. Mystical pride, conceit and vanity are related to the Initiates, Adepts and simple aspirants. The common and current pride, conceit and vanity are different. Many people have them. We must find the Truth - Power withi n ourselves. The one who does not find the Truth within himself, never finds it outside of himself. In order to leave the Chaos, we must fulfill the Truth. The virtues must crystallize within the Initiate. These wisely guide him. Peace emerges into the In itiate as a power that penetrates in him, in the most difficult regions. Peace within the Initiate makes him invincible. The Initiate discovers the eternal lights contained in the Abyss, by means of Peace. All the lights of Universal Wisdom are reuniting w ithin the Initiate and make him at peace with his power. The Truth is that which is, which has always been, and which will always be. The Truth is the unknowable, from instant to instant. Truth disguises itself with darkness within the Abyss. Demonius Est Deus Inversus. The Demon is God, but inverted. The Inferno is the womb of Heaven. The Philosophical Stone, the Stone of Truth must be searched for within the Inferno. Lucifer is the best friend that we have. Now, we comprehend why the Truth is the inferior power that emerges from Pistis Sophia in the Chaos. Thus, the Truth emerges from the Averno and departs from the monster of the Earth. Every treasure is found inserted within the womb of the Earth. The Golden Fleece is not an exception. CHAPTER 61 It ca me to pass then, when Jesus had heard these words, that he said: ‘well said, Mary, blessed one, who shall inherit the whole Light - kingdom.” Thereon Mary, the mother of Jesus, also came forward and said: “My Lord and my Saviour give commandment unto me also that I repeat this word.” Jesus said. “Whose spirit is understanding, him I do not prevent, but I urge him on still more to speak the thought which hath moved him... Now, therefore, Mary, my mother"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 180 according to matter, thou in whom I have sojourned, I bid t hee that thou also speak the thought of the discourse.” Marah, Mary, Isis, in Nature, also has the right to speak about the Christic Mysteries. Mary, the mother further interpreteth the scripture And Mary answered and said: “My Lord concerning the word which thy power hath prophesied through David: ‘Grace and truth met together, virtue and peace kissed each other. Truth sprouted forth out of the earth, and virtue looked down from heaven,’ - thus hath thy power prophesied this word aforetime about thee. Grace and Virtue always meet together and Peace and Virtue kiss each other. Virtue comes from Heaven and Truth sprouts from the Inferno. The story of the phantom spirit “When thou wert little, before the spirit had come upon thee, whilst thou wert in a v ineyard with Joseph, the spirit came out of the height and came to me in my house, like unto thee; and I had not known him, but I thought that thou wast he. And the spirit said unto me; ‘Where is Jesus, my brother, that I meet with him? And when he had sai d this unto me, I was at a loss and thought it as a phantom to try me. So I seized him and bound him to the foot of the bed in my house, until I went forth to you, to thee and Joseph in the field, and I found you on the vineyard, Joseph propping up the vin eyard It came to pass, therefore, when thou didst hear me speak the word unto Joseph that thou didst understand the word, wert joyful and saidest: Where is he, that I may see him; else I await him in this place.’ And it came to pass, when Joseph had heard thee say these words, that he was startled. And we went down together, entered the house and found the spirit bound to the bed. And we looked on thee and him and found thee like unto him. And he who was bound to the bed was unloosed, he took thee in his ar ms and kissed thee, and thou also didst kiss him. Ye became one. “This then is the word and its solution. ‘Grace’ is the spirit which hath come down out of the height through the First Mystery, for it hath had mercy on the race of men and sent its spirit t hat he should forgive the sins of the whole world, and they should receive the mysteries and inherit the Light - kingdom. ‘Truth’ on the other hand is the power which hath sojourned with me”. The Spirit must integrate himself with the human being, in order to become one with him and within him. This integration is not possible as long as we remain asleep. We must drink the wine of Gnosis and die within ourselves in order to attain the integration. The vine, the wine, is the result of the miracle of the sexua l transmutation. Attaining the radical death of oneself is possible only by working in the Flaming Forge of Vulcan.

And again as it said: Virtue [looked down] from heaven’ -- ‘virtue’ is the power which l ooked out of the height, which will give the mysteries of the Light to the race of men, so that they will become virtuous and good, and inherit the Light - kingdom.’ It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard these words, which his mother Mary spoke, that he said. Well said, finely, Mary.” The Grace - Power comes from the height, by order of the First Mystery. The Grace, or better if we say, the Grace - Power always comes from the height, through the First Mystery. Christ is the Spirit of Fire, the Fire of the f ire, the astral signature of the Fire. Only he can save us. Only the Intimate Christ can forgive the Karmic debts that we have. The Interior Lord can forgive the Initiate when the repentance is true. All doors are closed for the unworthy, except the one of repentance. To receive the Mysteries and to inherit the Light - Kingdom is possible, thanks to the Spirit of Fire. The Truth - Power is in the Intimate Christ and within the Intimate Christ, here and now. When the Intimate Christ departs from the abode of Bar belo, the Ocean of the Great Light, He comes to preach the Truth. The Truth transforms itself into a real body for the Initiate, because he is completely integrated with the Truth. When the Initiate experiences the Truth, he teaches the path that leads to the Truth. Every true Boddhisattwa sacrifices himself for the Truth. CHAPTER 62 The other Mary came forward and said: “My Lord, bear with me and be not wroth with me. Yea, from the moment when thy mother spoke with thee concerning the solution of these w ords, my power disquieted me to come forward and likewise to speak the solution of these words. Virtue is the Spirit of the Fire that brings the Mysteries from the Height in order to give them to the human race. Fundamental peace is possible only by self - exploring the ego in order to totally disintegrate it."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 182 It is stated that the Peace - Power has dwelt in the material body according to the world. This is due to the ego, which abides within the body. As long as it continues to thrive, peace will obviously be absent. We remain at peace with the Spirit by killing the ego. The greeting in the Initiatic College is: “May Peace be with Thee.” The reply is “and also with Thy Spirit.” We need to be in peace with the emanation of the Light. Grace - power and Truth - power embrace and kiss each other, thus, forming an integral wholeness. The Truth is the Tality, or totality. Obviously, the Tality is found in the depth of a Christ or a Buddha. The Tality is beyond the machinery of relativity, and also beyond the illuminated Void. The Tality is that which is beyond the body, the affections, and the mind. The Tality is that which is far beyond all dualism. The Tality in Christ, or in Buddha, or in Hermes, is always the same. Grace emerges from the Tality. The Truth is that whic h is, which has always been and which will always be. The Truth is incarnated only within the body of a Being like Jesus, Buddha or Hermes, etc. The temple of all the degenerated people of the Earth is a temple of iniquity and darkness. The Aryan Race is a lready degenerated and will soon be destroyed. The state in which this present humanity is found is useless in order to incarnate the Monad the Being. It is not possible for the Divine Monad to incarnate in the physical body, because of the way in which it is born, and because of its present condition. The incarnation of the Divine Monad and the distinct parts of the Being is made possible only by preparing the physical body, by means of the work in the Ninth Sphere. The Ninth Sphere is sex. Really, only th e sexual energy can transform the physical body, in order for it to incarnate the Divine Monad. It is possible to convert the physical body in the Temple of the Truth, by means of the sexual creative energy of Shiva, or the Holy Spirit, It is possible to i nherit the Light - Kingdom only by means of the Mysteries of Virtue. Virtues will not be born within us, if the ego is not annihilated If the virtues do not crystallize in us, we will never possess our Souls. With patience, you will possess your Soul. Each t ime a psychic aggregate is eliminated, we crystallize a virtue in its place. This is how the Soul crystallizes within us, little by little. Only by means of Virtue, can one enter the Mysteries.

It hath said again: ‘Virtue and peace kissed each other’ -- ‘virtue’ then is the spirit of the Light, which did come upon thee and hath brought the mysteries of the height, to give them unto the race of men. ‘Peace’ on the other hand is the power of Sabaoth, the Good, which is in thee, - - he who hath baptized and hath forgiven the race of men, -- and it hath made them at peace with the sons of the Light. And moreover as thy power hath said through David: ‘Truth sprouted forth out of the earth’ -- that is the power of Sabaoth, the Good, wh ich sprouted forth out of Mary, thy mother, the dweller on earth. ‘Virtue’, which ‘looked down from heaven,’ on the other hand is the spirit in the height who hath brought all mysteries of the height and given them to the race of men: and they have become virtuous and good, and have inherited the Light - Kingdom.” And it came to pass, when Jesus had heard Mary speak these words, that he said, “Well said, Mary, inheritress of the Light.” Grace is the spirit that comes to us in the Baptism. The Baptism is a pa ct of sexual magic. When we fulfill the pact of sexual magic, then we reach the inner Self - realization of the Being. The power of Sabaoth is the power of the Verb that comes to us as Grace when we fulfill the pact of sexual magic. Virtue is the Spirit of t he Light that crystallizes within ourselves when the ego dies. Virtue initiates us into the great Mysteries of life and death. Without virtues, we are not admitted into the Temples of Mysteries. Sabaoth baptizes the human being and makes him at peace with the Children of the Light. Sabaoth is the Verb, the Word, the Intimate Logoi, within each one of us. Mary is the daughter of Her Son, Her Lord and Saviour. Mary, Marah, the Woman - Serpent, is an autonomous and Self - conscious part of our own Being. Mary, th e mother, again further interpreteth the same scripture from meeting of herself with Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptizer And Mary, the mother of Jesus, again came forward, fell down at his feet, kissed them and said: “My Lord, my son and my Saviour, be not wroth with me, but pardon me, that I may once more speak the solution of these words. ‘Grace and truth met together’ -- it is I, Mary, thy mother, and Isabel, mother of John, whom I have met. ‘Grace’ then is the power of Sabaoth in me, which went fort h out of me, which thou art.

And again, ‘Grace and truth met together,’ -- that is thou, my Lord, thou who didst meet John on the day when thou hadst to receive the baptism.... And again thou and John are Virtue and peace kissed each other.’ Sabaoth, the Verb, the Logos, i s always the Son of Isis, the Saitic Mother of the Great Mysteries. John, who preached the path that leads to the Truth, was the son of Isis and Abel. This signifies that John, the Precursor was someone who had incarnated the Divine Monad. Atman, the Divin e Spirit of the human being, has two Children, two Souls: Isis and Abel. Isis is Buddhi, the Spiritual Soul and is feminine. Abel is the Human Soul and is masculine. Isabel is a profoundly significant name. IS - ABEL: ABEL is the gentleman who loves IS, his soul, his Walkiria. The Spirit - Soul is the wife of the Causal Man, the real Man. Therefore, John was someone who had incarnated the Monad. We must not mistake Isis, the adorable Walkiria, with the Saitic Mother Kundalini. ISIS, as a mantra can be applied t o the Walkiria. Yet, specifically, ISIS must be applied to the Divine Mother Kundalini. Christ is the path of truth and life. Grace and Truth always meet together. Of the incarnation of Jesus “Truth hath sprouted forth out of the earth, and virtue looked down from heaven, -- this is, during the time when thou didst minister tin to thyself, thou didst have the form of Gabriel, thou didst look down upon me from heaven and speak with me. And when thou hadst spoken with me, thou didst sprout up in me -- that is the ‘truth’, that is the power of Sabaoth, the Good, which is in thy material body, that is the ‘truth’ which ‘sprouted up out of the earth.” It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard his mother Mary speak these words, that he said “Well said, and fine ly. This is the solution of all the words concerning which my light - power hath prophesied aforetime through the prophet David.” John and Christ, Grace and Truth meet together.

THE NOTE OF A SCRIBE A note by a later hand, copied from another scripture Now these are the names, which I will give from the Boundless onward. Write them with a sign, that the Sons of God may be revealed from here on. This is the name of the Im mortal: aaa, ooo; and this is the name of the voice, for the sake of which the Perfect Man hath set himself in motion: iii. And these are the interpretations of the names of these mysteries: The first [name] which is aria, its interpretation is fff the sec ond, which is mmm or ooo, its interpretation is aaa, the third, which is ps ps ps, its interpretation is ooo; the fourth, which is fff its interpretation is nnn; the fifth, which is ddd, its interpretation is aria. He on the throne is aaa. This is the inte rpretation of the second; aaa,aaa,aaa this is the interpretation of the whole name. The Sons of God are exclusively the Christified Ones, those who have found the Golden Fleece within the womb of the world. The common and current intellectual animals are sons of the devil. I.A.O. is the sacred name. I.A.O. is the mantra of the Ninth Sphere. I.A.O. is the Dharani of sexual magic. I, reminds us of IGNIS, the Fire. A, reminds us of AQUA, the Water. O, reminds us of ORIGO, Principle, Spirit I, IGNIS, INRI, th e Sulphur. A, AQUA, the Mercury of the Secret Philosophy. O, the ORIGO, the principle mediator between Sulphur and Mercury of the Secret Philosophy. I, the Perfect Man is put in movement by ‘I’: IGNIS, INRI, the Fire. A, AQUA, the Mercury that is extracted from the brute mineral, the metallic soul of the sacred sperm, the water which does not wet, is the Fountain of Immortality. O, ORIGO, is the principle mediator between the Sulphur and the Mercury. It unites the two substances before it dies. Sulphur and Mercury, united by means of Salt, give origin to the Red Carbuncle, the Philosophical Stone. We will teach the complete Science of Alchemy, which is the Unveiled Mysteries of the Great Work, in our next book, entitled The Great Work. F, FIRE, FOHAT. The A, which is the pure water of life, the Mercury of the Great Work, can never be elaborated without Fire. O, ORIGO, principle, Spirit, is the Salt. As a result of it being volatile, it participates with the element air, and because of it being firm it partici pates with the fire. This must be analyzed. The Salt is within the ‘M’, Mercury, Sea, Water. However, it also participates with the Fire, which is the Sulphur."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 186 The Salt is volatile because it participates with the Air. However, it also participates with th e element Earth, as we see in the Salt mines. The Salt is related with AIR, FIRE, WATER, and EARTH. The Salt is the great mediator between Sulphur and Mercury. The Salt joins these two elements, integrates them, and unites them in a unique whole. M or O, w hose interpretation is A, is such because it is found in the Chaotic Sea of the Sacred Mercury. It is the Salt of the Great Ocean. P, PATAR, PETER, sex and its Mysteries, cannot function without the Origo, the Principle, the substance that unites the Sulph ur and the Mercury. S, the sweet and affable hiss (still small voice) that Elijah heard in the desert and that Apollonius utilized in order to willfully leave the physical body, is profoundly significant. We very well know that Apollonius was covered with a woolen mantle in order to practice. While seated, he concentrated on his navel. He begged his God to send the S, the sweet and affable hiss (still small voice), the subtle voice. When he had heard the sound that the cricket produces, he willfully left th e physical body. This fine sound vibrates in the cerebellum, in the head. In order to hear the subtle voice, quietude and silence of the mind is needed. S is the Ray, the Fire that without O, ORIGO, Principle or Spirit, would be impossible to be because S is O, Spirit. Thus, S, Fire, is also O, ORIGO, the Principle Spirit. The interpretation of F is N. This is because the three lines that represent the three primary forces of Nature and the Cosmos are in the letter N. To light the Sacred Fire within ourselv es, without the three primary forces Positive, Negative and Neutral, would be impossible. Man represents the Holy Affirmation. Woman represents the Holy Negation. The Holy Conciliation, the Neutral Force, conciliates the two forces in order to create and c reate a new. If there is a creation by means of Kriya - Shakti, meaning, without spilling Hermes’ Glass, just as the Lemurians of the third, fourth and fifth subraces did it, then the Sacred Fire will awaken in the aspirant. Thus the explanation of F, FIRE, FOHAT, is in the letter N, with its three forces. A. Z. F. is the secret key of the Great Arcanum. This is known by the Brahmans. A, AQUA, WATER, is the Ens Seminis within which is the Ens Virtutis of the Fire. Without the Mercury of the Wise, the Great Wo rk is not possible. This is why the interpretation of DDD is A. Even the Gods are sons of the Mercury of the Wise. It is ostensible that our interior profound God (Deus) also becomes a Son of the Mercury.

Grace and truth met together, and virtue and peace kissed each other. 11. Truth hath sprouted forth out of the earth, and virtue looked down from heaven.” John is the Verb within the Being of each one of us. Christ expressed Himself through the Prophet David. Solomon, son of David, King of Zion, learned very much from David. Truth emerges from the Abyss. Truth is found by the one who discovers the Treasury, the Golden Flee ce within the womb of the world. Virtue comes from the Height, from Heaven, when we eliminate those matters of the Abyss in and within ourselves, here and now. Each time we disintegrate a psychic aggregate, a virtue, which comes from the Height, from Heave n, crystallizes in our Essence. It is written that the vital body or the base of the organic life in each one of us has four ethers. The chemical ether and the ether of life are related with the chemical processes and sexual reproduction. The chemical ethe r is a specific foundation of the chemical organic phenomenon. The ether of life is the foundation of the reproductive and transformative sexual processes of the race. The two superior ethers, luminous and reflective, have more elevated functions. The lumi nous ether is related with the caloric, luminous, perceptive, etc., phenomenon. The reflective ether serves as a medium of expression for willpower and imagination. The two superior ethers are disjoined in order to form the Soma Puchicon by means of the In itiation. It is necessary to know that the Soma Puchicon is the ethereal body of the Heavenly Man. We can travel through the Infinite with the heavenly, ethereal, Christified and stigmatized body. The heavenly virtues crystallize in the Essence. The Essenc e, charged with the virtues, powers, laws, etc., is dressed with the Soma Puchicon. The Soul dressed with the Soma Puchicon is the human being of the Fifth Round, the liberated human. In the Fifth Round, the Earth will be blue, ethereal, transparent and in effable. The ethereal, christified Human, the Man Christ, can consciously and perfectly enters and depart from the physical body at will. Truth and virtue have totally united in the Ethereal Man. The Ethereal Man is the perfect Boddhisitta."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 189 The one, who do es not possess the Boddhisitta, even when he has created the superior existential bodies of the Being, is still unconscious and absurd. To visit the Buddhic lands with conscious will is possible only by possessing the Boddhisitta. The Buddhic lands are the superior worlds. The Boddhisattwas must first of all create the Boddhisitta. Fortunate is the Boddhisattwa who has the awakened Boddhisitta in his interior. The one who has the awakened Boddhisitta can see, hear, touch and feel all of the marvels of the B uddhic lands. The one who possesses the awakened Boddhisitta in his interior can visit the Temples of the Serpent in the depths of the seas. The Ethereal Man, the awakened Boddhisitta, can make himself invisible to the sight of his enemies. The Man - Christ, the conscious Boddhisitta, can make his physical body immortal. It is written that not even the poison of the Borgias, neither the knife, nor the bullet, can destroy the physical body of the Boddhisitta. The wildest beasts of Nature are humble in the pres ence of the Man - Christ. John further interpreteth the same scripture And John answered and said “This is the word which thou hast said unto us aforetime: ‘I have come out of the Height and entered into Sabaoth, the Good, and embraced the light - power in h im,’ “Now therefore, ‘Grace and truth’ which met together’ thou art ‘grace’, thou who art sent out of the regions of the Height through thy father, the First Mystery which looketh within, in that he hath sent thee, that thou mayest have mercy on the whole world. ‘Truth’ on the other hand is the power of Sabaoth, the Good which bound itself in thee and which thou hast cast forth to the Left, -- thou the first Mystery which looketh without. And the little Sabaoth, the Good, took it and cast it forth into the matter of Barbelo, and he made proclamation concerning the regions of Truth to all the regions of those of the Left.” The Intimate Christ comes out of the Height and enters into Sabaoth the Good, the Ethereal Man, who is the living crystallization of the Heavenly Sabaoth. Grace, Christ, meets together with Truth that emerges from the Abyss. Grace and Truth are found integrated in the Ethereal Man. Truth is the goal of Sabaoth the Good, the Man - Christ, the awakened Boddhisitta. Of Sabaoth Barbelo Yabraoth and the light - vesture “That matter of Barbelo then it is which is body for thee to - day. “And ‘virtue and peace’ which ‘kissed each other’ -- ‘virtue’ then art thou who didst bring all the mysteries through thy Father, the First Mystery which tooketh withi n, and hast baptized this power of Sabaoth, the Good; and thou didst go to the region of the rulers and dist give unto them the mysteries of the Height; they became righteous and good."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 190 “‘Peace’ on the other hand is the power of Sabaoth, that is thy soul, w hich did enter into the matter of Barbelo, and all the rulers of the six Aeons of Yabraoth have made peace with the mystery of the Light. “And ‘truth’ which ‘sprouted forth out of the earth’ -- it is the power of Sabaoth, the Good, which came out of the re gion of the Right, which lieth outside the Treasury of Light, and which hath come into the region of those of the Left; it hath entered into the matter of Barbelo, and hath made proclamation concerning the mysteries of the region of Truth. “‘Virtue’ on the other hand which ‘looked down from heaven,’ is thou the First Mystery which looketh down without, as thou didst come out of the spaces of the Height with the mysteries of the Light - kingdom; and thou didst come down upon the light vesture which thou didst receive from the hand of Barbelo, which [vesture] is Jesus, our Saviour, in that thou didst come down upon him as a dove.” It came to pass then, when John had brought forward these words, that the First Mystery, which looketh without, said unto him. “Well said, John, beloved brother.” The First Mystery sees everything from the interior to the exterior. The Little Sabaoth, the Man - Christ, who is the living crystallization of the Great Sabaoth, or Secret Elohim, takes the Truth. He accomplishes it and place s it within the Ocean of Light, which is the abode of Barbelo. Sabaoth - Christ always proclaims that which concerns the Regions of Truth. The people, the multitudes who always live in the Left, receive the teachings of Sabaoth. It is obvious that those mult itudes that live in the Left are ignorant. The crowds evolve and devolve incessantly in the Valley of Samsara. The devolving multitudes of the Left enter the Infernal Worlds. The involution within the womb of the Earth lasts until the Second Death. The Ess ence is free only with the Second Death, which is, the death of the ego within the womb of the Earth. The Essence that has passed through the Second Death evolves again, beginning with the Mineral Kingdom. The evolving Essences pass through the Mineral, Pl ant, and Animal Kingdoms, before reconquering the human state, which they had lost. The Wheel of Samsara rotates three thousand times. Whosoever wants to be liberated must liberate himself from the laws of evolution and involution. The Final Liberation is obtained only by way of the revolution of the Consciousness. The Wheel of Samsara rotates with the laws of evolution and involution. The evolving Anubis ascends through the right side of the wheel. The devolving Tiphon descends towards the Abyss through th e left side of the wheel. The devolving multitudes submerge themselves within the womb of the Earth. Each human cycle has one hundred and eight lives. After the one hundred and eighth life, the soul enters into the Abyss. Three thousand cycles exist, three thousand rotations of the great wheel. After the last cycle, the wheel ceases to rotate and all opportunities are lost. The souls of the last cycle submerge themselves within the Great Alaya of the Universe, in an elemental state."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 191 The Ethereal body of the Man - Christ is the crystallization of the Light that descends from the abode of Barbelo. Christ is the Virtue. Christ brings all of the Mysteries by the command of the Father. The Father is the First and the Last of the Mysteries. Christ baptizes the power of Sabaoth, the Good. The Intimate Christ delivers the Mysteries of the Heights to the Rulers. These Rulers, as we have said, are the distinct autonomous and Self - conscious parts of our own Being. The power of Sabaoth, as we have said, is the Man - Christ, the Man - Soul, covered with the Ethereal Body. It is clear that peace is the power of Sabaoth, which is the Soul of the Lord integrated with the Light that descends from Barbelo. It would not be possible to understand the Rulers of the six Aeons of Yabraoth , unless we comprehend the laws of the Sixth Mystery. It is necessary to know that the laws of the Sixth Mystery are contained within the Sixth Arcanum. The Sixth Mystery is related with the lovers, love and sex. The Rulers of the Sixth Mystery have made p eace with the Mystery of the Light. The absolute peace with the Mystery of the Light is completely sexual and can be attained only through sex. Whosoever gains innocence will arrive to the mansion of peace. The Rulers of the Sixth Mystery are within us. Th e laws of the Sixth Mystery take us to the Resurrection. Every Resurrected Adept has completely liberated himself from the original sin. Whosoever liberates himself from the original sin makes peace with the Mystery of the Light. It is obvious that the Tru th, which is obtained within the womb of the world, is the Treasury of Sabaoth, the Good, the Man - Christ. The Truth is the Treasury, which is found within the womb of the world. The Truth is the Golden Fleece, which is always guarded by a dragon that throw s fire and sulphur. Sabaoth, the Good departed from the region of the Virtue and conquered the Treasury of the Light. The Man - Christ always comes to the region of the lost, in order to help them. Those who live in the region of the Left devolve within the womb of the world. The pseudo - esoterist and pseudo - occultists of this Valley of Tears, who are bottled up within the dogma of evolution, stupidly believe that they can liberate themselves without dissolving the ego. The fanatics of the dogma of evolution d evolve through the path of the left hand. The path that leads to the Abyss is paved with good intentions. The Abyss is filled with sincerely mistaken ones. Fornicators and the enemies of sex are abundant in the Infernal Worlds.

The supporters of induced abortion and the women who willfully abort are also seen in the sphere of Lilith."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 192 Male and female adulterers of the world are also found in the sphere of Nahemah. It is stated that Adam had two wives, Lilith and Nahemah. Lilith is the Mother of abortion, incest, homosexuality, contraception and pederasty, etc. Nahemah is the Mother of adultery, lust, fornication and se xual abuse, etc. The Infernal Worlds within the interior of the Earth are divided into two inhuman spheres: Lilith and Nahemah. In this epoch of racial devolution, the multitudes of the Left are devolving within the submerged spheres of Lilith and Nahemah. The Great Illuminated Beings, that is to say, Sabaoth, fight in order to make the multitudes of the Left comprehend the crude realities of the facts. Unfortunately, the multitudes of the Left think that they are doing very well. This terrestrial humanity has reached the maximum of perversity. Humanity frightfully devolves in this instant of mundane crises and total degeneration. This devolving terrestrial humanity is entering into the submerged mineral kingdom in surges. Human beings will destroy each othe r amongst their own selves in a horrifying way, if the expected cataclysm is delayed too long. Unquestionably, the ego becomes more and more complicated as time passes. The complicated ego becomes terribly malignant. Frightfully, this terrestrial humanity has already failed and will become more and more perverse through time. To live normally upon the Earth will be something more than impossible within a short period of time. Malignity will be so great that within a short period of time, human beings will, in fact, have two thoughts in their minds: First, to kill; second, to be killed. Very shortly, in the direction that we are going, death, assassination, vice and perversity, multiplied to its maximum, will reign in every house. The great catastrophe that i s expected has converted itself into a non - delayable necessity. Only the great catastrophe can save us from the most horrifying terrors that the ego will let loose over the face of the Earth. We presently have no more hope, except for the universal blazing Fire. Christ is the Virtue that departs from the spaces, with the Mysteries of the Light - Kingdom. The Intimate Christ, expressing Himself through the perfect Man, is always the Master who teaches. Christ always speaks. He is the Verb who shows us the dan ger. The Word of the Lord has already warned us about the present time and the catastrophe that is approaching.

I called down Gabriel and Michael out of the Aeons, at the command of my Father, the First Mystery which looketh within, and I gave unto them the light - stream and let them go down into the chaos to help Pistis Sophia and to take the light - powers, which the emanations o f self - willed had taken from her, from them and give them to Pistis Sophia. “And straightaway, when they had brought down the light - stream into the chaos, it shone most exceedingly in the whole of the chaos, and spread itself over all their regions. And wh en the emanations of Self - willed had seen the great light of that stream, they were terror - stricken one with the other. And that stream drew forth out of them all the light - powers which they had taken from Pistis Sophia, and the emanations of Self - willed could not dare to lay hold of that light - stream in the dark chaos; nor could they lay hold of it with the art of Self - willed, who ruleth over the emanations.” Christ is the power that comes from the Height. Christ is the Saviour of Pistis Sophia. Pistis Sophia could not depart from the Chaos, if it was not for the Intimate Christ. The Initiate, filled with Pistis Sophia, departs from the Chaos, thanks to the Intimate Christ. The power that comes from Christ is a sunderable part of Christ. The sunderable p art of Christ gives the erotic impulse to the human being. The sunderable part of Christ, or better if we say, the living double of Christ, is Lucifer, the Maker of Light. Thanks to the Maker of Light, Pistis Sophia is liberated. The powers of Christ are f ound placed within the double of Christ. The power that comes from the Intimate Christ and the Christified Soul of Sabaoth, the Good, are joined, are integrated. They make themselves one single stream of light, a unique total. Thus the Man - Christ, covered with the Soma Puchicon, is a resplendent whole. Gabriel, as a Regent of the Moon, is one of the planetary Genii. Yet, the Intimate Gabriel is something distinct. He is one of the autonomous and conscious parts of our own Being. The Intimate Gabriel governs our own psychological Moon. The psychological Moon also has two faces, the visible and the hidden. All of our psychological defects, visible to simple sight are in the visible part of the Psychological Moon. However, the secret defects are found in the hi dden part of our own Psychological Moon. It is obvious that defects, psychic aggregates and perversities that we do not even remotely suspect, exist in the hidden part of our own Psychological Moon. Michael in the"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 194 Sun is an ineffable Archangel. Yet, Michae l within ourselves is different. Michael is an independent and conscious part of our own Being. Our readers must not forget the forty - nine Fires. Obviously, the forty - nine Fires are the forty - nine independent and conscious parts of our own Being. Michael a nd Gabriel, who symbolize, the Sun and the Moon, the Sulphur and the Mercury, serve the Alchemist in order to perform the Great Work. Thanks to the Magistry of the Fire, the Initiates filled with Pistis Sophia can rescue and take the Light of the Conscious ness, which is imprisoned within the psychic aggregates. It is ostensible that the psychic aggregates, within which the Light of the Consciousness is imprisoned, are Dry Mercury. We must annihilate the psychic aggregates and the arsenic Sulphur. The arseni c, poisonous Sulphur is an infernal type of fire within the lower animal depths of the human being. The Arsenic Sulphur is that horrible Python serpent that slithered in the mud of the earth and that the irritated Apollo hurt with his darts. It is the tail of Satan. We must distinguish between Satan and Lucifer. Satan is the devil, black like carbon, the fallen Lucifer. We must whitewash the devil. This is only possible by practicing sexual magic intensely and by disintegrating the ego. Humanity has Lucifer converted into the devil. Each one of us must whitewash his particular devil in order to convert him into Lucifer. When Lucifer shines in ourselves, he converts himself into our particular, individual Moses. Fortunate is the one who integrates himself wit h his own Moses. Moses, descending from Sinai with the luminous horns upon his forehead, deserved to be chiseled by Michelangelo. The Doctrine of Moses is the Doctrine of Lucifer. Christus - Lucifer is our Saviour, the Redeemer of Pistis Sophia. Christus - Luc ifer grasps the scale and the sword as a Lord of Justice. Lucifer, integrated with the Intimate Christ, shines in Sabaoth, the Solar Man. The Heavenly Sabaoth crystallizes within the Sabaoth - Man, thanks to the Intimate Moses. Sabaoth - Moses are totally inte grated. Sabaoth is the Internal God who must crystallize in the human person, thanks to the good duties of Lucifer. The Antichrist, the ego, knows nothing about these things. He merely wants a mechanical man and a universe originated by chance, an absurd m iracle from the reason without reason. On the other hand, religion hates Lucifer, and curses Him without knowing that he is the sunderable part of the Intimate Christ. The processes of cells and atoms could not be possible without the existence of intellig ent, igneous principles.

The powers that had bee n lost are precisely the forty - nine autonomous and Self - conscious parts of our own Being. All and each one of the autonomous and conscious parts of our own Being are precisely the Cosmic Powers of Pistis Sophia. Each power is personified by one or another Self - conscious part of our own Being. Three types of relations exist in the world and in life. The first one is the relation with the physical body. It is ostensible that if we do not know how to relate ourselves with our physical body, we become ill. The second type is the relation with the environment. If we do not know how to relate ourselves with people, we undoubtedly create many problems for ourselves. The third type is the most important relation.

The Christic light - stream falls into our interior, provoking a great wide flood. Then, the psychological city that we carry in our interior, which is Babylon the Great, the Mother of all abominations and fornications of the Earth, collapses. The transmuted Genesiac Waters inundate all that which is within our interior. The Christic light - stream provokes the interior catastrophe. All is crumbled away. The false structures, which are created by the psychic aggregates collapse. They cannot resist the Christic light - stream. The entire Philosophical Earth, our body, is transformed within its interior. The diverse parts of the Being drink. Their thirst is quieted and quenched when the dra ught from the hand of the Highest is given. The ministers of the draught, to whom the mercurial water have been entrusted, are the parts of the Being who are related with the transmutatory science of Yesod Mercury. The distinct Self - conscious and independe nt parts of the Being have refreshed their parched lips. They are filled with joy with the waters of life. All the Self - conscious and independent parts of the Being come to know themselves within the interior, profound Lord, by means of conscious works and voluntary sufferings. They save themselves by means of the Mercurial Waters of the Wise. The light - stream penetrates into the Chaos over all the emanations or undesirable elements of the ego. The Intimate Christ liberates the Essence, the Powers, in order to pour them into the interior of the Initiate, by means of the Buddhist Annihilation. Thus, Christ tears away all that is useless and then directs Himself towards our interior Temple. The emanations of the ego cannot hold the light - stream within the obsc urity of the Chaos. The Sulphur and the Mercury of the Wise are represented by Michael, the Solar Spirit, and by Gabriel, the Lunar Angel. They produce a complete transformation.

As Michael and Gabriel ex ist in the Macrocosm, they also exist in the Microcosmic Human Being. It is obvious that we always receive the Mysteries of the Light of the Height by means of the Sulphur and the Mercury. Sulphur and Mercury are fundamental in order to receive the light - s tream. Michael and Gabriel carry the stream of Christic Light. Michael and Gabriel, Sulphur and Mercury, are incessantly crossing themselves in order to give origin to the Philosophical Stone. The Sulphur and Mercury never steal the Light, because these tw o alchemical substances are the only fundamental elements of the Great Work.

All the other powers of the Being that the ego cannot take away from the Initiate are happy with the transcendental achievements. The Light reflects in all the parts of the Being and fills with happiness the wholeness of the host. The word of Christ strengthens the Souls who suffer. Michael and Gabriel, Sulphur and Mercury, pour the Light into Pistis Sophia. The entire body of Pistis Sophia is charged with Light. All the parts of the Being come to know themselves in the Lord. Christ dwells in His Temple and the powers of Pistis Sophia are integrating with the Intimate Christ. Peter, the Hierophant of sex always explains the Mysteries. Those who believe or think that sex is filthy and unworthy insult The Holy Spirit. Those who pretend to know the Mysteries, while excluding the power of sex, are in fact condemned to the submerged involution of the Infernal Worlds. Any pseudo - esoteric knowledge that is far away from the Mysteries of sex is absolutely useless, futile, and absurd. Sex is the real esoteric path that leads to the Final Liberat ion. We advance along the sexual path while we are disintegrating the ego. Those who have the intention of reaching Liberation, while abusing or cursing sex, are learned ignoramuses, mistaken ones, who are unknowledgeable of the Mysteries of Pistis Sophia. They are sincerely mistaken ones who enter into the Abyss. CHAPTER 66 The emanations of Serf willed cry aloud to him for help.

The Tempting Serpent of Eden, the horrible Python, incessantly fights in order to make the Initiate fall.

They do not want her Final Liberation. The Buddhas Pratyekas and many powerful Gods, Lords of the Law, do not want the Final Lib eration of Pistis Sophia. We need to submerge ourselves into the Light of the Light and in the Intelligence of the Intelligence, if we want the Final Liberation. The Boddhisattwas must fight against the powers of Light and against the powers of Darkness, w hen they want their Final Liberation. The Boddhisattwa who has the awakened Boddhisitta in his interior cannot be arrested by the Prince Adamas, nor by the holy Buddhas Pratyekas. The Boddhisattwas can defeat the Prince Adamas and the Buddhas Pratyekas, on ly by surrendering themselves to the Father, who is in secret. Adamas fulfills his duty of collecting old debts from Pistis Sophia. It is necessary to close the final accounts, in order to achieve the Final Liberation. There exists the common and current K arma, but the Law of Katancia, the superior Karma, also exists. We must close the accounts in the superior tribunals of Celestial Justice, before achieving the Final Liberation. Karmic debts are paid in the Tribunals of Objective Justice. The Gods and the great Initiates must be judged by the Judges of the Law of Katancia. The Lawyers of the Tribunals of Celestial Justice defend the Initiates in front of the Cosmic Judges. Cosmic Executioners, who fulfill the terrible commands of the Law, also exist. Each o ne of us carries the Police of Karma within our consciousness. The Police of Karma conduce us to the Tribunals of the Law. The Law of Katancia is not an exception and the great Initiates are conduced to superior tribunals. The negotiations with Adamas are frightful. When we have Cosmic Capital, we pay. Thus, the results are marvelous. Perform good deeds and perform them in abundance, so that you will have useful deeds as Cosmic Capital. The Great Law, combined with the powers of the Abyss, closes the way of Pistis Sophia.

Pistis Sophia departs from the Chaos with the help of Michael and Gabriel, who are the symbols of the Sulphur and Mercury of the Wise. The tenebrous ones incessantly attack the Initiate who is filled with Pistis Sophia, but the Christic light - stream triumphs. The Christic power triumphs over Adamas and over the tenebrous ones.

Demons and Saints look with horror and terror at the revolutionary Adepts of the Path of the Midst. No one understands these rebels of the Path of the Midst. The Revolutionary Walker of the Octuple Path, even being surrounded by many people, walks terribly alone. Hitler, who was terrorized before the presence of an Adept from the Path of the Midst exclaimed: “I know the Super - Man. I have seen him. He is terribly cruel. I myself; have felt fear.” The path is sexual. We advance by annihilating the ego and sacrificing ourselves for humanity. The Buddhas Pratyekas, even having built the exi stential superior bodies of the Being, are not Boddhisattwas. Obviously, the Buddhas Pratyekas fell in the path of the Right. There is also a great deal of Masters who fell on the path of the Left by means of Black Tantrism. The Boddhisattwas with compassi onate heart sacrifice themselves for planetary humanities through successive Mahamanvantaras, and finally, they achieve the incarnation of Christ."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 210 Only the Boddhisattwas of the Path of the Midst achieve the incarnation of Christ within themselves. The Inti mate Christ is the true refuge of the Boddhisattwa with compassionate heart. The Intimate Christ is beyond all evil and all punishment. The Angels of the Lord help the Boddhisattwas with compassionate heart. We need to defeat the Tempting Serpent of Eden a nd the horripilating basilisk of evil. The Boddhisattwa with compassionate heart must confront the Lion of the Law and defeat the Dragon. The Intimate Christ saves those who trust in Him. The Lord will assist us in the great tribulations. The Lord will inc rease us and show us salvation. Pistis Sophia trusted in the Light and the light - stream came from the Height in order to save her. The Light of the Light saves the Initiate from the emanations of Self - willed and from Adamas, the terrible Prince of the Grea t Law. Pistis Sophia drives the forces of the Right and the Left, which are the wings of the light - stream. Nevertheless, Pistis Sophia marches on the Path of the Midst. The Initiate must learn how to walk with two feet. It just so happens that some Initiat es do not know how to use the left foot and they fail. The Buddhas Pratyekas and their Sravakas aspirants are scared, and they anathematize the Boddhisattwa who knows how to walk with his two legs. The sincere and noble devotees from the path of the Right stone the Initiates who learn to sustain themselves in equilibrium over their left leg. Every Initiate who knows how to walk with his two legs terrorizes the noble ones of the Right. I am speaking in parables; I am speaking of sheep and goats. Some Initiat es know how to live with sheep, yet they do not know how to live with goats. The Initiates who are capable of sustaining themselves in complete equilibrium over the left foot are very rare. Whosoever has understanding, let him understand, for there is wisd om within. If Christ disguises Himself as the devil in order to descend into the Abyss and save us, why do not we imitate His example? The devil is whitewashed and transformed into a Maker of Light, that is, into Lucifer; you know this. I repeat, the Initi ate must learn how to move himself upon his two legs. The Initiate must learn how to disguise himself and move himself among the devils, not only in the Averno but also here in this world in which we live. The Light is the shield that protects the Initiate . Every Initiate must learn how to dim his light when he descends to the Infernal Worlds. If the Initiate who descends to the infernal worlds does not learn how to dim his interior light, he will scare the demons. Then, he cannot help the lost ones. The I nitiates must learn how to live serenely and gently within the terrors of the Abyss and the night. There is the need to learn how to handle the Flaming Sword. In the abode of Pluto, the Lord of time teaches us how to handle the Sword."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 211 The abode of Pluto is the Greek Tartarus, the Roman Averno, the infernal worlds within the interior of the Earth. The Thirteenth Aeon is the Superior Aeon. From it comes the Light of the Twelve Aeons. Rare, very rare, are those who obtain the arrival to the Thirteenth Aeon. Pi stis Sophia knows what Adamas, the Tyrant is. Law is Law and the Law is fulfilled. The Law of Karma is a medicine for the Soul. The Law throws us to the floor and punishes us when we deserve it. Midday is Kabbalistically stated, because it is between the T hirteenth Aeon and the Chaos. We fear the Lion - faced Power within the Darkness, within the Chaos. But in the Light, the fear disappears because we comprehend that the Law of Karma is a great medicine for the Soul. In complete Midday, which means, between t he Thirteenth Aeon and the Chaos, the Initiate has no need to fear disgrace or any demon. It is profoundly significant and Kabbalistic to say one thousand or ten thousand. One thousand will fall towards the Left, and ten thousand towards the Right. It is n ecessary to be two, in order to be one, and to know oneself as two. This is why the terrible ones of the Right will fall, and also the horrible ones of the Left. The enemies of the Left, and the sincerely mistaken ones of the Right fall at the revolutionar y step of Pistis Sophia. The Intimate Christ, within the Initiate, defeats the tenebrous forces and also the Law. The Lord defeats the inferior powers and imprisons them in the Chaos. The tenebrous powers that had tormented Pistis Sophia are submitted to h er when she is with faith in the Light of the Height. Pistis Sophia, guided by Gabriel and Michael, Mercury and Sulphur, cannot be imprisoned. The Initiate must pass over the Tempting Serpent of Eden, and over the horrendous Basilisk of Passions. Furthermo re, the Initiate must defeat the Lion of the Law and the Dragon. The Intimate Christ is above the Law and the Dragon; you know this. The monsters that personify the ego, the pluralized ‘I’ must die. CHAPTER 68 It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard these words that he said. “Well said, James, beloved one.” And the First Mystery continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: “It came to pass, when I had led Pistis Sophia out of the chaos, that she cried out again and said: T he Initiate in the Chaos without light suffers indescribably. Sophia singeth a song of praise 1. I am saved out of the chaos arid loosed from the bonds of the darkness. I am come unto thee, O Light."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 212 2. For thou wert light on all sides of me, saving me a nd helping me. 3. And the emanations of Self - willed, which fought against me, thou hast hindered through thy light, and they could not come nigh me: for thy light was with me and saved me through thy light - stream. 4. Because in sooth the emanations of S elf - willed constrained me, they took from me my power and cast me out into the chaos with no light in me. So I became as heavy - weighing matter in comparison with them. 5. And thereafter came a light - stream unto me through thee, which saved me; it shone on my left and on my right and surrounded me on all sides of me, so that no part of me was without light 6. And thou hast covered me with the light of thy stream and purged from me all my evil matters; and I shall be relieved of all my matters because of th y light 7. And it is thy light - stream, which hath raised me up and taken from me the emanations of Self - willed which constrained me. 8. And I have become sure - trusting in thy light and purified light in thy stream. 9. And the emanations of Self - willed, which constrained me, have withdrawn themselves from me: and I shone in thy great power, for thou savest forever. “This is the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, when she came forth out of the chaos and was freed from the bonds of the chaos. Now , therefore, who hath ears to hear, let him hear.” Only the Christic light - stream can save the fallen Initiate. The Christic power illuminates the intelligent rebel who marches on the Path of the Midst. The Christic light - stream saves us from the Buddhas Pratyekas of the Right and from the tenebrous Adepts of the Left. The evil matters of the undesirable psychic elements that the Initiate carries within are eliminated by the Christic light - stream. The ineffable Isis, the divine and venerable Saitic Mother of ancient Egyptian Mysteries, as a light - stream from Her Son, Christ, eliminates the compelling emanations of Self - willed. Isis, whose veil no mortal has lifted, is the daughter of Her Son, the terrific Christie light - stream. In one of Schillers’ poems, a young boy who dared to lift the veil of the Saitic Mother instantaneously fell to death when he saw the naked Truth in the face of the Goddess.Whosoever has ears to hear, let him hear and whosoever has understanding, let him understand, for there is wisdo m within."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 213 CHAPTER 69 It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying these words unto his disciples, that Thomas came forward, and said: “My Lord, my light - dweller hath ears and my mind hath understood the words which thou host said: Now, therefore, give commandment unto me to set forth clearly the solution of the words.” And the First Mystery answered and said unto Thomas: “I give thee commandment to set forth the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia sang unto me.” Thomas, the partic ular Thomas of each one of us, only accepts the Instructor of the World, the Intimate Christ within each one of us. The Thomas that exists within each one of us places his mind in the hands of the Intimate Christ, and only accepts the Intimate Christ. The Gospel of Thomas is marvelous. Whosoever places his mind in the hands of the Intimate Christ and accepts only the Intimate Christ marches on the Path of the Final Liberation. The demons of the mind will never defeat him. Thomas is one of the twelve within our own selves, one part of our own Being. The mind of Thomas exclusively receives the words of Christ. Thomas interpreteth the song of Sophia from the Odes of Solomon Thomas answered and said “My Lord, concerning the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttere d, because she was saved out of the chaos, thy light - power prophesied aforetime thereon through Solomon, the son of David, in his Odes: 1.

However, we must eliminate, coat by coat, the multiple defects of a psychological type. Obviously, each defect has multiple psychic aggregates that process the mselves in the seven and in the forty - nine levels of the Being. In any case, the seven is multiplied by seven; you know this. Thomas, in fact, is not comprehended. Thomas is despised and even condemned by many. He is judged unjustly as being incredulous an d sceptical for the mere fact that he does not accept any thing that does not come directly from the Intimate Christ. The power that helps the Initiate is the power of the Solar Verb. We must eliminate the coats of skin. In esoterism, this signifies the el imination of our psychological defects, coat by coat. The right hand of the Intimate Christ must clean the leper. It must heal him. Only the Intimate Christ will eliminate the filthy leprosy of Lazarus from ourselves. This is the horrifying leprosy of our abominations. We need to purify the interior Light in the light - stream of the Intimate Christ. CHAPTER 70 It came to pass then when the First Mystery had heard Thomas say these words that he said unto him. “Well said, finely, Thomas blessed one. This is the solution of the son which Pistis Sophia hath uttered” And the First Mystery continued again and said unto the disciples: “And Pistis Sophia continued and sang praises unto me, saying: The First Mystery blesses Thomas and approves the solution of the s ong of Pistis Sophia. The Secret Christ within the Adept confers to him power in Heaven and over the Infernos.

In great meas ure it ascends from the Earth up to Heaven, and descends again, newborn, on the Earth, and the superior and the inferior are increased in power.” The matter of the Light - Powers is the Mercury of the secret philosophy, the metallic soul of the sacred sperm, a living result of the transmutatory science Yesod - Mercury."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 216 The emanations of Self - willed are the psychic aggregates, Dry - Mercury, the undesirable psychic elements that we carry within.

This is how we can take a way the Light, which had been stolen from us, from within those tenebrous abominations.

Matthew speaks in accordance with science in Pistis Sophia. Matthew is one of the autonomous and independent parts of our own Being, the part that is related with pure science. Pure science is the science of the Being. Distinguish between the science of Christ and the science of the Antichrist. For these times of worldly crises and bankruptcy of all principles, the science of the Antichrist performs miracles and crooked prodigies. Every knee has been bent in the presence of the Antichrist, because the Antichrist makes atomic bombs, “N” bombs, “H” bombs, rays of death, and rockets with crew to the Moon, etc... The Great Harlot worships the materialistic science of the Antichrist, with all of its rotten theories, absurd utopias, hypothesis and barbarism of all types. The number of the Great Harlot is 666; you know this. Mercury causes us to descend from the heights to the Chaos, but it also causes us top from the Abyss and return to the Thirteenth Aeon. It is obvious that through sex we descend, we fall, or we ascend. Lucifer, the Maker of Light, is within the Mysteries of sex. Lucifer is the stairs to descend. Lucifer is the stairs to ascend.

There are many who believe that they comprehend the Initiates of the Direct Path, yet they do not comprehend them. The most difficult part of the matter is that these people do not comprehend that they do not comprehend. The Initiate is removed from the midst of the corpses and is resurrected in the Lord.

The Straight Road, the Direct Path, the Octuple Path, leads us from the Darkness to the Light. Those who renounce the happiness of Nirvana for the love of humanity, those who have the Nirmanakaya body or vehicle of solar transformation are the authentic Boddhisattwas who, indeed, walk along the Direct Path and know the word of the Lord.

They, the tenebrous ones, descend into the darkness of the No - Being and reduce themselves into atomic dust. Mary, Marah, Isis, Adonia, Tonantzin, is the Divine Mother Kundalini, the Woman - Serpent. Peter must deny Christ three times, it is written: “Before the cock crows twice, thou shall deny me thrice.” These are the three purifications based on iron and fire, before the Resurrection of the Intimate Christ within ourselves. Peter must descend to the Abyss th ree times, in order to work in the Darkness. The cock is Gaio, IAO, the Mercury of the secret philosophy. The triumph of Gaio is the success of the Sulphuric Mercury, the Resurrection of the Lord. Mary is afraid of Peter It came to pass then, when the Fi rst Mystery had finished speaking these words unto the disciples, that Mary came forward and said: “My Lord, my mind is ever understanding, at every time to come forward and set forth the solution of the words which she hath uttered, but I am afraid of Pet er, because he threatened me and hat eth our sat” And when she had said this, the First Mystery said unto her: “Every one who shall be filled with the spirit of light come forward and set forth the solution of what I say, - no one shall be able to prevent h im. Now, therefore, O Mary, set forth then the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered.” Then Mary answered and said unto the First Mystery in the midst of the disciples: “My Lord, concerning the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hat h uttered, thus hath thy light - power prophesied aforetime through David: "},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 223 Marah, The Divine Mother Kundalini, knows very well that the Light - Power of the Intimate Christ was prophesied through David, King of Zion. Mary interpreteth the Song of Sophia fro m Psalm XXIX 1. I will exalt thee, O Lord, for thou hast received me, and thou host not made glad my foes over me. 2. O Lord, my God, I cried up unto thee, and thou hast healed me. 3. O Lord, thou host led up my soul out of hell thou host saved me from them which have gone down into the pit.” The Lord saves us from the Infernos. The Lord liberates us from within the womb of the psychic aggregates that have fallen in the Infernal Worlds. CHAPTER 73 And when Mary had said this, the First Mystery said un to her, “Well said, finely, Mary, blessed one.” And he continued again in the discourse and said unto the disciples: “Sophia again continued in this song and said: Sophia says that which the Lord says, because Sophia is the result of the multiple, sundera ble divisions of the Lord. Sophia continueth her song 1. The Light hath become my Saviour. 2. And it hath changed my darkness into light, and it has rent the chaos which surrounded me and girded me with light.” It came to pass then, when the First Myst ery had finished saying these words, that Martha came forward and said: “My Lord, thy power hath prophesied aforetime through David concerning these words: The Light saves Pistis Sophia. Unquestionably, only the Light of lights, the Father of all lights u nfolded into the Intimate Christ, can save us. Martha interpreteth from Psalm XXIX 10. The lord hath become my helper. 11. He hath changed my lamentation into joy; he hath rent my mourning robe and girded me with joy.”"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 224 And it came to pass when the Firs t Mystery had heard Martha speak these words, that he said “Well said, and finely, Martha.” And the First Mystery continued again and said unto the disciples: “Pistis Sophia again continued in the song and said: The interior, profound Lord converts lament ations into joy. He tears the mourning - robe and girds us with joy. There is too much suffering in the Great Work, but the Lord saved us from the Abyss and fills us with plenitude. Sophia continueth her song 1. My power, sing praises to the Light and forg et not all the powers of the light, which it hath given unto thee. 2. And the powers, which are in thee, sing praises to the name of his holy mystery; 3. Who forgiveth all thy transgression, who saveth thee from all the afflictions with which the emanati ons of Self - willed have constrained thee; 4. Who hath saved thy light from the emanations of Self - willed which belongs to destruction; who hath wreathed thee with light in his compassion, until he saved thee; 5. Who hath filled thee with purified light; and thy beginning will renew itself as an invisible of the Height. “With these words Pistis Sophia sang praises, because she was saved and remembered all things which I had done unto her.” The Light that has been given to us, or the Light that is awarded to us when the ego dies, is the Light of the Intimate Christ. The powers of Pistis Sophia, all of the independent parts of the Being, must sing praises to the interior, profound Lord. Only the Intimate Christ can forgive us and save us from all bitterness . Nevertheless, we do not deny that the Intimate Christ grants the power to pardon sins to His Divine Mother Kundalini, the Woman - Serpent. The emanations of Self - willed restrict us and embitter our lives. The Lord crowns us with His light and saves us. The Lord fills us with His purified light. Our principles, renewed by the Lord, shine gloriously.

David, was certainly a Great Initiate through whom the Light - Power of the Intimate Christ was expressed. David achieved the Buddhist Annihilation. Mary interpreteth from Psalm CII 1. My soul, prais es the Lord, let all that is in me praise his holy name. 2. My soul, praise the Lord and forget not all his requitals. 3. Who forgiveth all thy iniquities; who healeth all thy sicknesses; 4. Who redeemeth thy l from decay; who wreatheth thee with grace and compassion 5. Who satisfleth thy longing with good things, thy youth will renew itself as an eagle’s. “That is: Sophia will be as the invisibles who are in the Height; he hath, therefore, said ‘as art eagle,’ because the dwelling - place of the eagle i s in the height, and the invisibles also are in the Height; that is: Pistis Sophia will shine as the invisibles, as she was from her beginning.” It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard Mary say these words, that he said: “Well said, Mary, b lessed one.” The eternal youth is renewed with the Elixir of Long Life. Whosoever resurrects in the Lord will enjoy the Elixir of Long Life. Therefore, he will convert himself into a Mutant. Pistis Sophia, who is the resurrected Initiate, enters into the Superior Order that the Logos has established in Nature. The Immortal Members of this Secret Order, even being visible, become invisible to humanity. These Brethren form the Conscious Circle of the Solar Humanity that operates upon the superior centers of the Being. The Brethren of the Superior Order work intensely, through uncountable centuries, helping humanity. The Brethren of the Superior Order are endowed with terribly divine powers. The Brethren of the Superior Order are Feathered - Serpents. They are e agles of the Spirit. Sophia is led to a region below the thirteenth aeon and given a new mystery It came to pass then thereafter, that the First Mystery continued again in the discourse and said unto the disciples: “I took Pistis Sophia and led her up to a region which is"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 226 below the thirteenth aeon, and gave unto her a new mystery of the Light which is not that of her aeon, the region of the invisibles. And moreover I gave her a song of the Light, so that from now on the rulers of the Aeons could not [prev ail] against her. And I removed her to that region until I should come after her and bring her to her higher region. “It came to pass then, when I had removed her to that region, that she again uttered this song thus: There exists a certain Mystery in a region, which is below the Thirteenth Aeon, which is known only by the Great Initiates. She continueth to sing. 1. In faith have I had faith in the Light; and it remembered me and hearkened to my song. 2. It hath led my power up out of the chaos and the neither darkness of the whole matter and it hath led me up. It hath removed me to a higher and surer aeon, lofty and firm; it hath changed my place on the way which leadeth to my region. 3. And it hath given unto me a new mystery, which is not that of my aeon, and given unto me a song of the Light. Now, therefore, O Light, all the rulers will see what thou hast done unto me, and be afraid and have faith in the Light. “This song then Pistis Sophia uttered, rejoicing that she had been led up out of the chao s and brought to regions which are below the thirteenth aeon. Now, therefore, let him whom his mind stirreth, so that he understandeth the solution of the thought of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, come forward and say it.” Andrew came forward a nd said: ‘“My Lord, this is concerning what thy light - power hath prophesied aforetime through David. The Mystery of the secret ‘Daath’ is comprehended only by a few. The Interior Andrew of each one of us, with his famous cross in an ‘X’, which has been ex plained in previous chapters, says, “My Lord, this is concerning what thy Light - Power hath prophesied aforetime through David.” Andrew interpreteth from Psalm XXXIX 1. In patience I tarried for the Lord; he hath given heed unto me and ear unto my weeping . 2. He hath led up my soul out of the pit of misery and out of the filthy mire; he hath set my feet on a rock and made straight my steps. 3.

CHAPTER 75 And he continued again in the disco urse and said unto the disciples: ‘These are all adventures which have befallen Pistis Sophia It came to pass then, when I had led her to the region which is below the thirteenth aeon, and was about to go unto the Light and depart from her, that she said u nto me: Pistis Sophia passes through terrible adventures along the Octuple Path. The conversation of Sophia and the Light “ O Light of lights, thou wilt go to the Light and depart from me. And Tyrant Adamas will know that thou hast departed from me and will know that my Saviour is not at hand. And he will come again to this region, he and all his rulers who hate me, and Self - willed also will bestow power unto his lion - faced emanation, so that they all will come and constrain me all together and take my w hole light from me, in order that I may become powerless and again without light. Now, therefore, O Light and my Light, take from them the power of their light, so that they may not be able to constrain me from now on... The road that leads us to the Light of the light is the Path of the Razor’s Edge. This way is full of dangers within and without. The light promiseth to seal the regions of Self - willed “It came to pass then, when I heard these words which Pistis Sophia had spoken unto me, that I answered h er, saying: ‘My Father, who hath emanated me, hath not yet given me commandment to take their light from them; but I will seal the regions of Self willed and of all his rulers who hate thee because thou host had faith in the Light. And I will also seal the regions of Adamas and of his rulers, so that none of them may be able to fight with thee, until their time is completed and the season cometh that my Father give me commandment to take their light from them’ Christ saves the Initiate and protects him fro m Adamas, the Tyrant, and from the attacks of the tenebrous ones and from the Rulers. CHAPTER 76 “And thereafter I said again unto her: ‘Hearken that I may speak with thee about their time, when this which I have said unto thee, will come to pass. It wil l come to pass when [the] three times are completed.’"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 228 “Pistis Sophia answered and said unto me: ‘O Light, by what shall I know when the three times will take place, so that I may be glad and rejoice that the time is near for thee to bring me to my region, and moreover rejoice therein that the time is come when thou wilt take the light - power from all them which hate me, because I have had faith in thy light?’ The Initiate who wants the Final Liberation must liberate himself from Adamas, and from the Rulers of the Cosmos, and from the vibrations of Self - willed. In the proper time and hour, the Intimate - Christ within the Initiate will settle the affairs with Adamas and the Rulers, in order to liberate Pistis Sophia. Three indicates complete perfection. Only wh en the three times are completed does the Initiate achieve the Final Liberation. How Sophia will know that the time of her final deliverance hath come . “And I answered and said unto her: ‘If thou seest the gate of the Treasury of the Great Light with is opened after the thirteenth aeon, and that is the left [one] -- when that gate is opened, then are the three times completed.’ “Pistis Sophia again answered and said: ‘O Light, by what shall I know, -- for I am in this region, -- that that gate is opened? T he gate of the Treasury of the Great Light must open beyond the Thirteenth Aeon. We must pay all at the gate of the Treasury of the Great Light, before the gate of the Universe is delivered to us. Whosoever has understanding, let him understand, for there is wisdom within. It is not possible to depart from the Universe without having settled all of our affairs at the gate of the Treasury. What will come to pass at that time. “And I answered and said unto her: ‘When that gate is opened, they who are in all the Aeons will know because of the Great Light which will obtain in all their regions. But see, I have now settled that they shall venture no ill against thee, until the three times are completed And thou wilt have the power of going down into their twelv e Aeons, when it pleaseth thee, and also of returning and going into thy region, which is below the thirteenth aeon, and in which thou now art. But thou wilt not have the power of passing through the gate of the Height which is in the thirteenth aeon, so a s to enter into thy region whence thou didst come down. Moreover, if then the three times are completed, Self willed and all his rulers will again constrain thee, to take thy light from thee, being enraged against thee and thinking that thou hast imprisone d his power in the chaos, and thinking that thou hast taken its light from it. He will then be embittered against thee, to take from thee thy light, in order that he may send it down into the chaos and it may get down to that emanation of his, so that it m ay be able to come up out of the chaos and go to his region. Adamas will attempt this. But I will take all thy powers from him and give them unto thee, and I will come to take them. Now, therefore, f they constrain thee at that time, then sing praises to t he Light, and I will not delay to help thee. And I will quickly come unto thee to the regions, which are below thee. And I will come down to their"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 229 regions to take their light from them. And I will come to this region whither I have removed thee, and which is below the thirteenth aeon, until I bring thee to thy region whence thou art come.’ “It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had heard me say these words unto her, that she rejoiced with great joy. But I removed her to the region, which is below the thi rteenth aeon. I went to the Light and departed from her.” When the gate of the Universe is delivered to us, the Great Light shines in all of the Aeons. Pistis Sophia is attacked by Adamas and by Self - willed and by the Rulers of the Universe, even in the l ast instant before the gate of the Universe is delivered to us. The one who writes this has accompanied some twins towards the gate of the Universe, and thus can explain this Mystery. Fortunate are those who achieve the departure from this Universe in orde r to enter into the Uncreated Light. Those who enter into the bosom of the Great Reality possess the glorious body of Dharmakaya. Those who possess the body of Dharmakaya submerge themselves within the joy of life, free in its movement. Happiness is inexha ustible for those who submerge themselves within the bosom of the Great Reality. Adamas tries to capture Pistis Sophia, but the Intimate Christ fights against Adamas and defeats him. Pistis Sophia sings praises unto the Light, and Christ helps her. The int erior profound Lord must take Pistis Sophia to the region of Daath, before finally taking her far beyond the Thirteenth Aeon, the abode of the Light. Christ takes Pistis Sophia out of the mysterious region of Daath when He considers it to be necessary and He takes her to the region of Daath when it is indispensable. The region of Daath is absolutely sexual. The Sephira Daath is related with the Great Mysteries of Lingam - Yoni. The Great Initiates must work for certain periods with the transmutatory science o f Yesod - Mercury. When the Initiates of midday are working with the transmutatory science, the Chalice of the Temple appears without its metallic cover. When the Initiate is not working with Daath, the Mystery that is below the Thirteenth Aeon, then the Cha lice of the Temple shines with its golden cover. The time for the final deliverance of Sophia is completed. And all these adventures the First Mystery told to the disciples, that they should come to pass for Pistis Sophia. And he sat on the Mount of Oliv es, narrating all these adventures in the midst of the disciples. And he continued again and said unto them: “And it came to pass again after this, while I was in the world of men and satin the way, that is in this region which is the Mount of Olives, befo re my vesture was sent unto me, which I had deposited in the four - and - twentieth mystery from the interior, but the first from the exterior, which is the Great Uncontainable, in which I am enwrapped, and before I had"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 230 gone to the Height to receive my second vesture, -- while I sat with you in this region, which is the Mount of Olives, that the time was completed of which I had said to Pistis Sophia ‘Adamas and all his rulers will constrain thee.’ Christ keeps His vesture in the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery, the Mystery that works with the laws of the Sixth Mystery. Only by working in the Great Work, with the Rulers of the Sixth Mystery, is the Adept able to invest himself with the vesture of glory. Adamas and the Rulers of the distinct zones of the Universe put forth many impediments for the Initiate. CHAPTER 77 “It came to pass then, when that time came on, -- and I was in the world of men, sitting with you in this region, which is the Mount of Olives, -- that Adamas looked down out of the twelve Aeons and loo ked down at the regions of the chaos and saw his demon power which is in the chaos, that no light at all was in it, because I had taken its light from it; and he saw it, that it was dark and could not go to his region, that is to the twelve Aeons. Time an d time again, Adamas is angry with Pistis Sophia when she takes the Light. The powers of good and evil fight against the Initiate and he must defeat them if he wants the Final Liberation. It is urgent to receive the gate of the Universe in order to escape from this world of relativity. Before receiving the final Truth, the war against the power of good and evil is frightful. In the world of duality, which is within the machinery of relativity, Adamas collects very ancient debts from Pistis Sophia. Tenebrous and diabolic emanations are found to be related with old Karmic debts. Tenebrous regions within the Universal regions are the living result of Karma. The Angels of the Law collect the Karmic debts from the Initiates. The dark Chaos waits for those who owe . The one, who is paying and is restricted and pursued, remains without Light. Pistis Sophia, without Light, suffers extremely. Her splendors are eclipsed within the battle of antithesis. Adamas sendeth forth two emanations of darkness to plague Sophia “ Thereon Adamas again remembered Pistis Sophia and became most exceedingly wroth against her, thinking that it was she who had imprisoned his power in the chaos, and thinking that it was she who had taken its light from it. And he was exceedingly embittered ; he piled wrath on wrath and emanated out of himself a dark emanation and another chaotic and evil, the violent [one] so as through them to harass Pistis Sophia. And he made a dark region in his region, so as to constrain Sophia therein. And he took many of his rulers; they pursued after Sophia, in order that the two dark emanations which Adamas had emanated, might lead her into the dark chaos which he had made, and constrain her in that region and harass her, until they should take her whole light from he r, and Adamas should take the light from Pistis Sophia and give it to the two dark"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 231 violent emanations, and they should carry it to the great chaos which is below and dark, and cast it into his dark power which is chaotic, if perchance it might be able to c ome to his region, because it had become exceedingly dark, for I had taken its light - power from it. “It came to pass then, when they pursued after Pistis Sophia that she cried out again and sang praises to the Light, since I had said unto her: ‘If thou sha ll be constrained and singest praises unto me, I will come quickly and help thee.’ It came to pass then, when she was constrained, -- and I sat with you in this region, that is on the Mount of Olives, -- that she sang praises to the Light, saying: The Ini tiate who fights in order to depart from the Universe of relativity resigns and has faith in the Intimate Christ. Nevertheless, he is willing to lose his Light and fall into the Chaos if the Interior Lord wishes him to do so. Sophia again singeth a song t o the Light 1. O Light of lights, I have had faith in thee. Save me from all these rulers who pursue after me, and help me. 2. That in sooth they may never take from me my light, as the lion - faced power [did] for thy light is not with me and thy light - stream to save me. Nay, Adamas is the more enraged against me, saying unto me: Thou hast imprisoned my power in the chaos. 3. Now, therefore, O Light of lights, if I have done this and have imprisoned it, if I have done any injustice at all to that power, 4. Or if I have constrained it, as it hath constrained me, then let all these rulers who pursue after me, take my light from me and leave me empty. 5. And let foe Adamas pursue after my power and seize upon it and take my light from me and cast it into his dark power, which is in the chaos, and keep my power in the chaos. 6. Now, therefore, O Light, lay hold on me in thy wrath and lift up thy power above my foes who have lifted themselves up against me to the very end 7. Quicken me quickly, as thou has t said unto me: I will help thee. The Lion of the Law pursues Pistis Sophia, but she has faith in the Intimate Christ. CHAPTER 79 And the First Mystery continued again and said unto the disciples: “It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had finished u ttering the words of this song, that she turned herself back to see whether Adamas and his rulers had turned back to go to their aeon. And she saw them, how they pursued after her. Then she turned unto them and said unto them: "},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 232 The Light of the Interior Pr ofound Lord can liberate the Initiate from his persecutors. Sophia addresseth Adamas and his rulers 1. Why pursue ye after me and say: I should not have help, that it [the Light] should save me from you? 2. Now, therefore, my vindicator is the Light and a strong [one] but it is long - suffering until the time of which it hath said unto me: I will come and help thee. And it will not bring its wrath upon you always. But this is the time of which he hath spoken unto me. 3. Now, therefore, if ye turn not back and cease not to pursue after me, then will the Light make ready its power, and it will make itself ready in all its powers. 4. And in its power hath it made itself ready, so that it may take your lights which are in you, and ye may become dark; and its power hath brought it to pass, so that it may take your power from you and ye go to ground “And when Pistis Sophia had said this, she looked at the region of Adamas and saw the dark and chaotic region which he made, and saw also the two dark exceedingly v iolent emanations which Adamas had emanated, in order that they might seize Pistis Sophia and cast her down into the chaos which he had made, and constrain and harass her in that region, until they should take her light from her. It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had seen those two dark emanations and the dark region which Adamas had made, that she feared and cried unto the Light, saying: Adamas, the Law, can collect and cause the Initiate to suffer, but the Intimate Christ helps the Soul who wants to escape from the Universe of Relativity. Sophia again singeth to the Light. 1. O Light, lo! Adamas, the doer of violence, is wrathful; - he hath made a dark emanation. 2. And he hath also emanated another chaos and hath made another dark and chaotic [ one] and made it ready. 3. Now, therefore, O Light, the chaos which he hath made, in order to cast me down therein and take from me my light - power, take them from him his own. 4. And the plan which he hath devised, to take my light, -- they are to take h is own from him; and the injustice which he hath spoken to take my lights from me, -- take then all of his.

CHAPTER 80 Martha again came forward and said. “My Lord. I am sober in my spirit and understand the word, which thou sayest. Now, t herefore, give me commandment to set forth their solution in openness.” And the First Mystery answered and said unto Martha “I give thee commandment, Martha, to set forth the solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered in her song.” And Martha a nswered and said; “My Lord, these are the words which thy light - power hath prophesied aforetime through David in the seventh Psalm, saying: If the Initiate does not change, if he does not repent, he falls under the arrows of the Law. Martha interpreteth the words of Sophia from Psalm VII 12. God is a righteous vindicator and strong and long - suffering, who bringeth not on his wrath every day. 13. If ye turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow and made it ready. 14. And he hath made ready f or him instruments of death; he hath moxie his arrows for those who will be burnt up. 15.

Its wrong will return on its own head, and its injustice will come down on its pate. When Martha had said this, the First Mystery which looketh without, said unto her: “Well said, finely, Martha blessed [one] The instruments of deat h and the arrows of Justice are prepared against the transgressors of the Law. Injustice produces iniquities and the Law falls upon the transgressors. Each one will fall into the hole, which he has dug. Evil will return upon the one who produces it.

It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished telling his disciples all the adventures which had befallen Pistis Sophia when she was in the chaos, and the way she had sung praises to the Light, that it should save her and lead her out of the chaos, and lead her into the twelve Aeons, and also the way it had saved her out of all her afflictions with which the rulers of the chaos had constrained her, because she longed to go to the Light, that Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: “It came to pass then after all this, that I took Pistis Sophia and led her into the thirteenth aeon, shining most exceedingly, there being no measure for the light which was about me. I entered into the region of the four - and - twenty invisibles, shining most exceedingly. And they fell into great commotion; they looked and saw Sophia, who was with me. Her they knew, but me they kne w not, who I was, but held me for some sort of emanation of the Light - land. “It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia saw her fellows, the invisibles, that she rejoiced in great joy and exulted exceedingly and desired to proclaim the wonders which I had wr ought on her below in the earth of mankind, until I saved her. She came into the midst of the invisibles, and in their midst sang praises unto me, saying: Only the Intimate Christ can save the Initiate and settle the debts. This is possible only based on great repentance and profound comprehension. The region of the twenty - four Elders is the Thirteenth Aeon. The twenty - four Elders are within us. They are the twenty - four zodiacal parts of our own Being. The twenty - four Elders know the human soul very well. The twenty - four Elders know that Christ is the central fire of the Earth.

Sophia singeth the prai ses of the Light to her fellow - invisibles 1. I will give thanks unto thee, O Light, for thou art a Saviour; thou art a deliverer for all time. 2. I will utter this song to the Light, for it hath saved me and save me out of the hand of the rulers, my foes . 3.

Now, therefore, who is exalted in his thought, let him come forward and say the solution of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered.” Christ is the Light and life. Whosoever trusts in Him will never be in darkness. The enemies Rulers are the Agents of the Law. Neverth eless, we must comprehend the significance of the parable. The Masters of Karma are obliged to administer the Law. Great dangers exist in the Heights, just as in the profundities of the Chaos and out of the Aeons. The Rulers of the Sphere always call upon us to pay our debts in the Tribunals of the Objective Justice. When the Initiate provokes he who commands the Light, he violates the Law and the commander of the Law punishes him. The Intimate Christ has to work intensely within the Initiated human being, in order to disintegrate the undesirable psychic elements and save him. The violator of the Law lives in the regions where the Law has transgressed, but the Intimate Christ, with compassion, allows him to depart from these regions, with the condition of su preme repentance. The fallen Initiate loses his sacred Mysteries and falls into the prisons of the Chaos. The Intimate Christ descends to the world of men each time when necessary and gives them the Mysteries of the Heights. The Lord always reincarnates Hi mself when religion decreases and degenerates and when evil takes force. CHAPTER 82 It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished saying these words, that Philip came forward and said “Jesus, my Lord, my thought is exalted, and I have understood the solu tion of the song which Pistis Sophia hath uttered. The prophet David hath prophesied concerning it aforetime in the one - hundred - and - sixth Psalm, saying: Philip, within each human being, is one of the Self - conscious parts of our own Being. Philip must teac h the Initiate how to consciously travel outside of the physical body. Philip must practically teach the Initiate to place the physical body into the superior dimensions, in order to travel within the hyperspace. The Great Initiates can travel to very remo te places of the Earth with their physical body, without the necessity of ships, airplanes, cars, etc. There exists a clue in order to invoke Philip: “To the little heaven, Philip.” This is the clue. The mystic must go to sleep while concentrating on Phili p. The mystic must submerge himself into meditation while invoking Philip. The mystic must arise from the bed when he feels that his body is in the state of lassitude and he must advance while invoking Philip."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 237 The Lord orientates and helps the Initiates wh o walk in the desert of Life.

Hearken, therefore, my Lord, that I may say it clearly.

The marvelous works of the Lord with the children of men take them to the final truth. The Word of the Lord heals the Initiates and liberates them from their miseries, but we must perform the Word within ourselves. Whosoever hears the Word and does not per form it is like a man who looks at himself in front of a mirror and then turns his back and walks away. Philip within ourselves has great wisdom, love, and power. The Eager Soul, Pistis Sophia, can be liberated only with the help of the Lord. The Intimate Christ is Father and Mother at the same time. The Intimate Christ conciliates the Macrocosm with the Microcosm within real human beings. The Intimate Christ, as a mediator, moves Himself between two spheres, the one from above and the one from below. The F ire of the fire, Christ, is the living nucleus of every planet, sun, or galaxy. The Intimate Christ is the great Mediator and the great Integrator. The Father, who is in secret and our Divine Mother Kundalini are integrated within the Intimate Christ. All of the forty - nine autonomous and Self - conscious parts of our Being are integrated in the Intimate Christ. In reality, the forty - nine fires are integrated in the Intimate Christ. The Human Soul, Pistis Sophia, is saved by Christ. Pistis Sophia, integrated w ith the Interior Christ, shines gloriously in the Uncreated Light. The happiness of Pistis Sophia is inexhaustible when she integrates herself with the Intimate Christ. This is the Word of the Blessed One. These are the Teachings that the Adorable One utte red on the Mount of Olives. The Interior Lord is our profound Saviour. We have spoken of Pistis Sophia, the Eager Soul, so hated by the Antichrist of the false, materialistic science. The sceptical Sadducees, enemies of the Eternal One, hate the Christ and Pistis Sophia. The forever hypocritical Pharisees, who by misinterpreting the Scriptures kill the Spirit that vivifies it, those scoundrels of the dead sects, who know nothing about Christic Esoterism, also hate and condemn Pistis Sophia. It is written wi th letters of fire that the sandals of Peter the Fisherman will return to Rome. On occasion, the Lord told me, “I have always helped you, and I will always help you. I always help those who have passed through the schools of Baalim.” Verily, verily I say u nto you, that neither the materialistic Sadducees, nor the hypocritical Pharisees of dead sects know anything about the Intimate Christ or about Pistis Sophia. The schools of the Baalim are the materialistic and religious organizations that do not know the Intimate Christ or Pistis Sophia. Any materialistic or mystical organization that pronounces itself against the Mysteries of sex belongs to the order of the schools of Baalim.

For thou hast said unto us aforetime: ‘Seek that ye may find, and knock that it may be opened unto you. For every one who seeketh shall find, and to every one who knocketh it shall be opened’ Now, therefore, my Lord, who is it whom I shall seek, or who is it at whom we shall knock? Or who rather is able to give us the decision upon the words concerning which we shall question thee? Or who rather knoweth the power of the words concerning which we shall question?

Now, therefore, my Lord, be not wroth with me, but reveal unto me the matter concerning which I shall question thee.” It ca me to pass, when Jesus had heard Mary Magdalene say these words, that he answered and said unto her: “Question concerning what thou desirest to question, and I will reveal it unto thee with precision and certainty. Amen, amen, I say unto yow Rejoice in gre at joy and exult most exceedingly. If ye question concerning all with precision, then shall I exult most exceedingly because ye question concerning all with precision and question in the manner in which it beseerneth to question.

Verily, verily I say unto you that light would fir st be lacking upon the Earth before a Mary Magdalene would be absent from a great Initiate’s side. The Solar Logos, reincarnated in a human body, has a Mary Magdalene as a wife and works with her in the Great Work. Only the Intimate Christ possesses and kn ows the power of the words, which are concerned with what we are questioning. Let us distinguish between the mind, and a mind of Light.

The Four and Twenty Invisibles exist in the zodiacal macroco sm and in the zodiacal human being.

W e must never forget the seven, the twelve and the twenty - four, etc., within ourselves. Indeed, the forty and nine fires are the forty and nine independent and Self - conscious parts of our real Being. Each one of the Four and Twenty Invisibles shines ten th ousand times more than the light of the physical sun. The spiritual light of the invisible Sun penetrates through many veils and suprasensible regions. The light of the spiritual Sun shines in the region of the Virgin of Light. The Sun - Christ shines ten th ousand times more than the Four and Twenty Invisibles. The great invisible Forefather is Aelohim, the Unknowable Divinity. The great Triple - Powered God is the Demiurge Creator of the Universe: Multiple Perfect Unity. The Creator Logos is the Holy Triamatzi kamno. The Verb, the Great Word.

Similarly, our interior Universe will be consummated in the Aeons in order to reascend towards that which has no name, the region of the Cosmic Inheritances, of those who wil l receive the Mystery of the Light.

The twel ve Saviours, or twelve Christified Ones, are related with twelve Zodiacal signs and with the twelve Planets of the Solar System that rotate around the Sun. We have stated in the beginning of this book that our Solar System is composed of the Sun and the tw elve Planets. We spoke clearly of the thirteen Heavens and of their relations with the thirteen worlds and the thirteen Aeons. Twelve worlds rotate around the Sun, and each one of them has its corresponding planetary Genie. It is ostensible that the twelve are also within ourselves. It is obvious that the twelve Powers inside the Macrocosm, as well as in the Microcosmic human being are related with the twelve Mysteries. Each one of the twelve Mysteries is always related with the First Mystery. The twelve My steries are situated in the twelve fundamental parts of the Being. Let us think in the twelve Sephiroth, or twelve Aeons within ourselves. Thus, we will comprehend the twelve Mysteries by Kabbalistic relation. The Thirteenth Mystery is the most secret of a ll the Mysteries. Of the ascension of those of the Treasury into the Inheritance “And the seven Amens and the five Trees and the three Amens will be on my right, being kings in the inheritances of the light. And the Twin - Saviour, that is the Child of the Child, and the nine guards will abide also at my left, being kings in the inheritances of the Light. All of this related with the seven Amens and the five Trees and the three Amens, has been previously explained, as well as the Twin Saviour."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 249 Of their res pective ranks in the kingdom “And every one of the saviours will rule over the orders of his emanations in the inheritances of the Light as they did also in the Treasury of the. Light” “And the nine guards of the Treasury of the Light will be superior to the saviours in the inheritances of the Light. And the Twin - saviours will be superior to the nine guards in the kingdom. And the three Amens will be superior to the Twin - saviours in the kingdom. And the five Trees will be superior to the three Amens in the inheritances of the Light.” The reader must read the first chapters in which I speak of all of this. Obviously, each one of the twelve Saviours will rule over the Orders that are found to be related with their own essences, lives, zodiacal Monads. It is clear that each one of the twelve is related with a zodiacal sign. We have explained that twelve Zodiacal Orders exist. Leo is the superior Order, being governed by the Lions of Life, or Lions of Fire. Now our devotees will comprehend the power of the twel ve Saviours over the Forces, Essences, and Prodigies of the twelve Zodiacal Constellations. The nine Guardians of the Treasury of the Light are within the Microcosmic human being and within the Macrocosm. Obviously, the nine Guardians are found to be relat ed with the Mercury of the Wise and with the transmutatory science of Yesod - Mercury. It is clear that the nine are superior to the twelve in the Inheritances of the Light, for the Gods are the Children of the Mercury of the Wise. Let us understand very wel l that the twelve Saviours reached the exulted state in which they are, thanks to the Mystery of the Ninth Sphere. The sexual Mysteries are found in the Ninth Sphere. The Twin Saviour is found in the Sixth Aeon. He is the Causal Man with the incarnated Chr ist. It is amazing, that Christ descended from the Kingdom of Chockmah in order to manifest himself in Tiphereth. The Lord is born from the womb of the Divine Mother Kundalini. The Lord is conceived by the work and grace of the Holy Spirit. The Lord incarn ates in the Causal Man. Therefore, the Causal Man is the Child of the Child. The Lord only incarnates in the true Boddhisattwas. This is the reason why it is said that Christ is the Boddhisattwa. Christ is the Multiple Perfect Unity. Christ is the Platonic Logos. Christ is the Demiurge Architect of the Universe. Christ is our Lord Quetzalcoatl. Quetzalcoatl is the Feathered Serpent, the Multiple Perfect Unity. The Twin Saviour is superior to the nine Guardians in the kingdom, due to the fact that he made hi mself Master of the Mysteries of the Ninth Sphere. The Three Amens, Holy Affirmation, Holy Negation, and Holy Conciliation, are superior to the Twin Saviour in the Kingdom."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 250 It is evident, that the Twin Saviour is such, due to the crystallization of the thr ee Primordial Forces of Nature and the Cosmos in himself. Without these three Forces, the Twin Saviour never would have become what he is. This is why these three Primordial Forces are superior to the Twin Saviour. The five Trees of the Great Law govern th e Cosmos and they are superior to the three Amens in the inheritances of the Light. Obviously, every Christified One must settle his accounts and present himself before the Cosmic Treasury, before receiving the gate of the Universe. Of the powers of the R ight, and their emanation and ascension. ‘And Yew and the guard of the Veil of the Great light, and the receiver of Light and the two great guides and the great Sabaoth, the Good, will be kings in the first Saviour of the first Voice of the Treasury of th e Light, [the Saviour] who will be in the region of those who have received the first mystery of the First Mystery. For in sooth Yew and the guard of the region of those of the Right and Melchisedec, the great receiver of the Light, and the two great guide s have come forth out of the purified and utterly pure light of the first Tree up to the fifth. “Yew in sooth is the overseer of the Light, who hath come forth first out of the pure light of the first Tree; on the other hand the guard of the veil of those of the Right hath come forth out of the second Tree; and the two guides again have come forth out of the pure and utterly purified light of the third and fourth Trees of the Treasury of the Light, Melchisedec again hath come forth out of the fifth Tree; o n the other hand Sabaoth, the Good, whom I have called my father, hath come forth out of Yew, the overseer of the Light. ‘These six then by command of the First Mystery the last Helper hath caused to be in the region of those of the right, for the economy of the Ingathering of the upper light out of the Aeons of the rulers and out of the worlds and all races in them, -- of every one of whom I will tell you the employment over which he hath been set in the expansion of the universe. Because, therefore, of th e importance of the employment over which they have been set, they will be fellow - kings in the first [Saviour] of the first Voice of the Treasury of the Light, who will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the first mystery of the First Mystery. Yew, Prince of the faces, Guard of the veil of the Great Light, and the receiver of Light, and the great guides of the great Sabaoth, the Good, independent and Self - conscious, transcendental parts of our own Being, will be Kings with the First S aviour. The First Saviour is related with the First Voice of the Treasury of the Light. Obviously, the First Saviour has received the First Mystery of the First Mystery. Those who have received the First Mystery of the First Mystery have their Saviour. The Ancient of Days is indeed the First Mystery of the First Mystery. Yew, Angel of faces, and the guard of the region of those of the Right, and Melchisedec, the Genie of the Earth who is the Great Receiver of the Light, and the two great guides, have come f orth from the purified Light. The Divine Hierarchies, that exists in the Macrocosm and in the Microcosm, emanate from the five Trees of the Great Law."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 251 Yew, Prince of the faces, always obedient to the Ancient of Days, is the overseer, which means, he is the splendor, the Life of the Great Light. Yew emanates from the pure Light of the First Tree of the Great Law. He is the same Law within ourselves, here and now. It is written that the Guard of the Veil has emanated from the Second Tree. The two Great Guides emanate from the pure Light of the Third and Fourth Trees of the Great Treasury. Melchisedec, the regent of the planet Earth, who dwells in the region of Agarthi within the interior of the World, has emanated from the Fifth Tree of the Great Law. Sabaoth, the Good emanates from Yew, the Prince of the faces, the overseer, the splendor of the Light. These six are in reality six Self - conscious and independent parts of our own Being. The economy of the ingathering of the Light is something transcendental. To t alk about the ingathering of the Light is something tremendous. We know very well that the intellectual animal is not a human being. Outcome of the fatal mixture of humans and beasts. Unquestionably, it is necessary to create the human being. The intellect ual animal is not a human being. Fortunately, the intellectual mammal bears the germs of the human being in his sexual glands. Nevertheless, the availability to become a human is needed. The sun is performing a tremendous experiment at this moment, in the test tube of Nature. The sun wants to create human beings. In the time of Abraham, the prophet, the sun achieved the creation of a good quantity of humans. During the first eight centuries of Christianity, a good ingathering of solar men was also achieved. In these present times of the twentieth century, the Sun is making tremendous efforts in the test tube of Nature. The Sun wants a new harvest of light for the Light. Nevertheless, a revolution of the grain, of the seed, is needed, a conscious co - operation with the Sun. The sexual reproductive system that the animals use, including the intellectual mammal mistakenly called man (human), is useless in order to create the human being. The human being can never be created by means of the exclusively animal sexu al reproductive system. If the human being wants to be created, it is necessary to utilize the sexual system of human reproduction. The power of Kriya - Shakti, through which the solar men reproduce themselves, is the unique power that, indeed, can create hu man beings. Unfortunately, the intellectual animals mortally hate the power of Kriya - Shakti. This is because the power of Kriya - Shakti totally excludes the sexual orgasm, the animal spasm, which is the seminal spilling of the irrational and intellectual be asts. Seminal ejaculation is exclusively animal, never human. Human creation within ourselves is achieved only by avoiding the seminal ejaculation. However, the intellectual animal rejects the reproduction of Kriya - Shakti due to the if we place the intelle ctual animal and the human being face to face, we will find physical"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 252 similarities. However, the psychological processes of each one of them are completely different. At the time of the end of the Lemurian Continent, which was situated in the past in the Pa cific Ocean, some real humans who fell into animal generation became degenerated and mixed themselves with beasts of Nature. Obviously, this is the origin of the Atlantean root race. The present human root race descended from the trunk of Atlantis. Therefo re, this present root race that now lives on the face of the Earth is the fact that the beast only knows how to reproduce itself by means of the animal generation system. Unquestionably, when the intellectual animal admits the solar and human reproductive system of the great power of Kriya - Shakti, then, he converts himself into a true human. It is ostensible that by means of the power of Kriya - Shakti, the germs of the true man which are within the organism are developed. This is how the true man is born wit hin ourselves. The Sun wants a harvest of solar men. In an Anahuac codex, I found a phrase which states: “The Gods made men from wood, and then they fused them with Divinity.” I then found another phrase, which states: “Not all men achieve the fusion with Divinity.” Men made from wood: This reminds us of the Masters of carpentry, such as Joseph, the Carpenter, the terrestrial father of Jesus; in other words, the workers of the Great Work. Unquestionably, the true man can be born within the human organism, b ased on conscious works and voluntary sufferings. Nevertheless, it is written that not all men achieve the fusion with Divinity. The real man (human being) must convert himself into a Boddhisattwa, in order to completely fuse himself with Divinity. Obvious ly, only the Boddhisattwas with compassionate heart can incarnate Christ. It has always been said, and for good reason, that Christ is the Boddhisattwa. Solar men are truly the ingathering of the supreme Light of the Aeons. The Sun now wants a new harvest of solar men and it deserves it, due to the great work performed with organic life. The Sun has worked intensely in this delicate thin covering of organic life, placed over the geological crust of the Earth. Now, the Sun wants to see the result of its work . The Sun wishes to have a new harvest of solar men at once. Every race of humanoids serves for the solar experiment. Nevertheless, when a race is becoming too lunar, mechanical and materialistic, the Sun destroys it, because it is no longer useful for its experiment. Such is the case of this present Aryan root race, which has become vulgar, crude, atheistic and frightfully materialistic. This is the reason why this present root race will be destroyed in the ‘Thirteenth Katun’ of the Mayas. Nevertheless, be fore the great catastrophe, which is approaching, the Sun will obtain a small harvest of solar men. Truly, the Sun will harvest only a few solar, exemplary individuals in this epoch. It is ostensible, that this present root race of humanoids, which populat es the face of the Earth, presents no hope what so ever. This Aryan root race has reached maximum degeneration. Therefore, it will suddenly be destroyed."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 253 Fortunate are those who live in the region of the souls who have received the First Mystery of the Fir st Mystery. Verily, they will be fellow - kings with the First Saviour of the First Voice of the Treasury of the Light. Of the powers of the Midst and their ascension “And the Virgin of Light and the great guide of the Midst, whom the rulers of the Aeons a re wont to call the Great Yew after the name of the great ruler who is in their region, -- he and the Virgin of Light and his twelve ministers, from whom ye have received your shape and from whom ye have received the power, they all will be kings with the first Saviour of the first Voice in the region of the souls of those who will receive the first mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light “And the fifteen he of the seven virgins of the Light who are in the Midst, they will expand thems elves in the regions of the twelve saviours, and the rest of the angels of the Midst, every one of them according to his glory, will rule with me in the inheritances of the Light And I shall rule over them all in the inheritances of the Light.” The Virgin of Light is our Divine Mother Kundalini. The Great Guide of the Midst is the Prince of the faces, the great Yew. All of this is within ourselves. They are the distinct parts of our own Being. The Rulers of the Aeons know very well the Prince of the faces, the splendid Yew. The marvelous Ruler who is in his region is a very excellent part of our own Being. He and the Virgin of Light and the twelve Potencies within our own Being have endowed us our celestial shape. The celestial Zodiacal shape that we carry in our Being was inherited from the twelve Potencies. All of them will be Kings with the First Saviour of the First Voice, in the region of the souls that will receive the First Mystery of the First Mystery, in the inheritances of the Light. Typhoon Baphom et, Lucifer - Prometheus, is the best of the helpers of the Divine Mother Kundalini in the work of the Great Work. There exists seven degrees of the Power of the Fire that we must develop within ourselves. These are the seven radicals. These are the seven se rpents, two groups of three, with the sublime coronation of the seventh tongue of fire that unites us with the One, with the Law, with the Father. These are the seven ‘Woman Serpents’, the seven Virgins. All of these Fiery - Helpers and the Seven Virgins alw ays expand themselves in the regions of the Twelve Zodiacal Saviours. The rest of the distinct parts of the Being, each one according to His glory, integrated with the Intimate Christ, will govern with Him in the Inheritances of the Light.

At the end of the Great Cosmic Day, the words of the Lord will be consummated. Obviously, the Universe will ascend from octave to octave before i ts total dissolution. The perfect souls of the Inheritances of the Light will ascend with the Universe, from octave to octave. In the end, they will become submerged into the bosom of the Absolute. They will then enjoy an inexhaustible joy. When the Univer se is dissolved, the joy of the Great Pralaya arrives. The Great Pralaya is the profound Cosmic Night. When the ingathering of the perfect souls is completed, the Mahapralaya, the Cosmic Night arrives. The Cosmic Night arrives when the ingathering of the p erfect souls is completed. Truthfully, the quantities of years assigned to a Cosmic Day are symbolic. The Cosmic Night arrives when the ingathering of the perfect souls is complete, which means, when the Cosmic Day is absolutely perfected.

At the end of the Maharnanvantara, all the parts are integrated with the Intimate Christ, and the profound night of the Great Pralaya arrives.

He sacrificed himself for Quetzalcoatl. Ce - Acatl is the other part of the Being of Quetzalcoatl, reincarnated in anot her body. Thus, the Christified Adept, who has his Twin, lives simultaneously in distinct times and places. The transactional passing of all the Self - conscious and independent parts of our own Being, during the final integration, inwardly occurs. Each part sinks into another. Each part receives the Gnostic unction and the seal of its Mystery. Each one, which means, each part is suitable in its sphere and in its ministry. All the parts integrated with the Intimate Christ submerge themselves, within the Inher itances of the Light. The order in which the Great Kabir Jesus describes the process of the final integration, in the man and within the man, is marvelous. Of the ascension of the souls of the perfect. “[The souls] will all come, every one at the time wh en he will receive the mysteries; and all the rulers who have repented, will pass through and come into the region of the Midst.

Thus, each one of those of the region of the Midst and of the Right and each one of those of the complete region of the Treasury, will remain in their corresponding region until the future Cosmic Day. Each one of the parts of the Being that is integrated will keep his qualities until the beginning of the new Mahamanvantara. All the souls must receive the Inheritance of the Light. The arrival to the Inheritances of the Light is accomplished from in terior to interior. Each part of the Being must complete his values for the integration. In Gnosis, if the diverse, autonomous and Self - conscious parts of the Being were unknown, then the work of the solar and human integration would not be understood. In all of this, there is a process described by the Great Kabir Jesus. Whosoever has understanding, let him understand, for there is wisdom within. This is how Mary, the Woman - Serpent, receives the teaching of Jesus. CHAPTER 87 Mary interpreteth the discour se from the Scriptures. “It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words, that Mary Magdalene started forward and said: ‘My Lord, my indweller of light hath ears and I comprehend every word which thou sayest. Now, therefore, my Lord, on account of the word which thou host spoken: ‘All the souls of the race of men who shall receive the mysteries of the Light, will go into the Inheritance of the Light before all the rulers who will repent, and before those of the whole region of the Right and before the whole region of the Treasury of the Light.’ -- on account of this word, my Lord, thou host said unto us aforetime: ‘The first will be last and the last will be first,’ -- that is, the ‘last’ are the whole race of men which will enter into th e Light - kingdom sooner than all those of the region of the Height, who are the first.’ On this account, therefore, my Lord, host thou said unto us: ‘Who hath ears to hear let him hear,’ -- that is thou desirest to know whether we comprehend every word, wh ich thou speakest. This, therefore, is the word, my Lord” It came to pass then, when Mary hail finished saying these words, that the Saviour was greatly astonished at the definitions of the words which she spoke, for she had become"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 257 pure spirit utterly, Jes us answered again and said unto her: “Well said, spiritual and pure Mary. This is the solution of the word.” The soul is valuable. It is a precious gem that goes into the Inheritance of the Light before all, before the Rulers and before the ones of the Ri ght and before the complete region of the Treasury of the Light. The Man Soul, the Man Being, will enter the region of the Inheritance of the Light before the other parts of the Being. It is written that the first will be the last and the last will be the first. The suffering man will be the first in the Inheritance of the Light, then all the other parts of the Being will follow. At the same time as the races of Solar Men are being collected, they will enter the region of the Inheritance of the Light before the Beings that live in the Ineffable regions. CHAPTER 88 It came to pass then again after all these words, that Jesus continued in the discourse and said unto his disciples: “Hearken, that I may discourse with you concerning the glory of those of the H eight, how they are, according to the manner in which I discoursed with you unto this day. The Last Helper is, indeed, Adhi - Buddha. Obviously, Adhi - Buddha is the Father of the Father, the Unmanifested in the Unknowable. Unquestionably, the Unknowable Unma nifested is the Buddha of the Buddha. When entering the bosom of the Absolute, the Ancient of Days must integrate himself with Adhi - Buddha. Of the last Helper “Now, therefore, if I lead you into the region of the last Helper, who surroundeth the Treasury of the Light, and if I lead you into the region of that last Helper and ye see the glory in which he is, then will the region of the Inheritance of the Light count for you only for the size of a city of the world, because of the greatness in which the las t Helper is, and because of the great light in which he is. That the regions beyond the Helpers are indescribable “And thereafter I will discourse with you also concerning the glory of the Helper who is above the little Helper.

On this account, therefore, there existeth no manner to describe it in this world” It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his disci ples, that Mary Magdalene came forward and said unto Jesus: “My Lord, be not wroth with me if I question thee, because I trouble repeatedly. Now, therefore, my Lord, be not wroth with me I question thee concerning all with precision and certainty. For my b rethren will herald it among the race of men, so that they may hear and repent and be saved from the violent judgments of the evil rulers and go to the Height and inherit the Light - kingdom; because, my Lord, we are compassionate not only towards ourselves, but compassionate towards the whole race of men, so that they may be saved from all the violent judgments. Now, therefore, my Lord, on this account we question concerning all with certainty; for my brethren herald it to the whole race of men, in order tha t they may escape the violent rulers of the darkness and be saved out of the hands of the violent receivers of the outer - most darkness.” “It came to pass, when Jesus had heard Mary say these words, that the Saviour answered in great compassion towards her and said unto her: “Question concerning what thou desirest to question, and I will reveal it unto thee with precision and certainty and without similitude.” The violent judgments of the evil Archons fall upon those who violate the Law. The terms good and evil are very discussable. Something is good when it is suitable to us and evil when it is not suitable to us. Evil Rulers must be understood in esoteric form. No one can enjoy the violent judgments of the Lords of Kanna. This is why they are symbolically denominated as evil Archons. We need to be saved from the Archons or violent Rulers of darkness and also from the violent receivers of the outermost darkness. There exists in the Averno the darkness, and also the Darkness of the darkness. The Averno is fou nd situated within the nine submerged, mineral infra - dimensions. These nine infra - dimensions are in the interior of the Planet Earth. Nevertheless, do not confuse the nine submerged infra - dimensions with the merely physical geological part of the world Ear th. It is useful to clarify that the merely physical geological part of the world Earth is hollow. Let us remember the survivors of Lemuria, Atlantis, etc. They still live in Agarthi, the interior part of the Earth. They keep their archaic, powerful civili zations, and they even have cosmic ships in which they travel through the unalterable Infinite. The divine Humanity of Agarthi works and lives under the personal direction of Melchisedec, the King of the World. Multiple entrances lead to the Kingdom of Aga rthi. Fierce tribes guard some of these entrances. There also exist nine superior dimensions within the interior geological part of the world. The secret Temples of the Conscious Circle of the Solar Humanity, which operates upon the superior centers of the Being are found situated within the nine superior dimensions. Creatures and terribly divine forces operate in the nine superior dimensions of the Planet Earth. The violent receivers of the Darkness of the darknesses dwell in the infra - infernos of the worl d Earth."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 259 Let us then distinguish between what is the merely geological, physical, and tetra - dimensional part of the earth, and what are the superior dimensions and infra dimensions of the interior of the Earth. The mineral mass Earth has then three absolu tely different aspects that the Gnostic must study. Woe to those who fall in the Tartarus, in the Darkness of the darknesses governed by the violent receivers of the Abyss! CHAPTER 89 Mary further questioneth Jesus It came to pass then, when Mary had he ard the Saviour say these words, that she rejoiced with great joy and exulted exceedingly and said unto Jesus: “My Lord, by how much greatness then is the second Helper greater than the first Helper? By how much distance is he distant from him, or rather h ow many times more does he shine that the latter?” The Second Helper and the First Helper are autonomous and Self - conscious parts of our own Being. Jesus explained all of this very well, so there is no need to comment about it. Of the second Helper Jesu s answered and said unto Mary in the midst of the disciples: “Amen, amen, I say unto you the second Helper is distant from the first Helper in great immeasurable distance in regard to the height above and the depth below and the length and the breadth. Fo r he is exceedingly distant from him in great immeasurable distance through the angels and all the archangels and through the gods and all the invisibles. And he is very considerably greater than the latter in an incalculable measure through the angels and archangels and through the gods and all the invisibles. And he shineth more than the latter in an utterly immeasurable measure, there being no measure for the light in which he is, and no measure for him through angels and archangels and through the gods and all the invisibles, as I have already said unto you at another time.” It is clear that the distance from the Second Helper to the First Helper is an immeasurable, intimate distance in regards to the divine height above, and the depth below, and the le ngth and breadth. People do not understand these immeasurable, psychological distances. Thus, the Second Helper is considerably much greater and psychologically exulted than the First. Of the third, fourth, and fifth Helpers “In like manner also the thir d Helper and fourth and fifth Helper, -- one is greater than the other . . . and shineth more than the latter and is distant from him in a great immeasurable distance through the angels and archangels and the gods and all the"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 260 invisibles, as I have already said unto you at another time. And I will tell unto you also the type of every one [of them] at their expansion.” The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Helpers shine marvelously. In the depth, these Five Helpers are: Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Michael, and Samael. I t is ostensible that these Five have their exponents in the Human Soul of every living creature. CHAPTER 90 Mary again questioneth Jesus. It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished saying these words unto his disciples, that Mary Magdalene came forwa rd again, continued and said unto Jesus: “My Lord, in what type will be those who have received the mystery of the Light, in the midst of the last Helper?” Of those who receive the mystery of the last Helper And Jesus answered and said unto Mary in the m idst of the disciples: “They who have received the mystery of the Light, f they come out of the body of the matter of the rulers, then will every one be in his order according to the mystery which he hath received. Those who have received the higher myster ies will abide in the higher order; those who have received the lower mysteries will be in the lower orders. In a word, up to what region every one hath received mysteries, there will he abide in his order in the Inheritance of the Light. For which cause I have said unto you aforetime: “Where your heart is, there will your treasure be,’ -- that is up to what region every one hath received mysteries, there shall he be.” It came to pass, when Jesus had finished saying these words unto his disciples, that John came forward and said unto Jesus: “My Lord and my Saviour, give me also commandment that I discourse before thee, and be not wroth with me if I question concerning all with precision and certainty; for thou my Lord, hast promised me in a promise to make r evelation unto us of all concerning which I shall question thee. Now, therefore, my Lord, hide nothing from us at all in the matter on which we shall question thee.’ And Jesus answered in great compassion and said unto John: “To thee also, blessed John, a nd beloved, I give commandment to speak the word which pleaseth thee, and I will reveal it unto thee face to face without similitude, and I will say unto thee all on which thou wilt question me with precision and certainty.” These words of the Great Kabir Jesus are so clear that an explanation is unnecessary. John questioneth Jesus And John answered and said unto Jesus: “My Lord, will then every one abide in the region up to which he hath received the mysteries, and hath he no power to go into other"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 261 orde rs which are above him; and hath he no power to go into the orders which are below him?” It is ostensible that the one who receives the Mysteries in one region, continues in this region until he receives more elevated Mysteries. CHAPTER 91 And Jesus an swered and said unto John: “Finely indeed do ye question on all with precision and certainty. But now, therefore, John, hearken that I may discourse with thee. Every one who hath received mysteries of the Light will abide in the region up to which every on e hath received mysteries, and he hath not the power to go into the height into the orders, which are above him. The Verb, the Word, speaks with precision and certainty. Of the first commandment “So that he who hath received mysteries in the first Comma ndment, hath the power to go into the orders which are below him, that is into all the orders of the third space; but he hath not the power to go into the height to the orders which are above him... Of the first space Arid he who shall receive the mysterie s of the First Mystery, which is the four - arid - twentieth mystery from without and the head of the first space which is without, -- he hath the power to go into all the orders which are without him; but he hath not the power to go into the regions which are above him or to pass through them. It is obvious that the one who has received Mysteries in the First Commandment, has power to go to the orders which are below him, which means, to all of the orders of the third Space. However, he can never go to the or ders, which are above him. The Mysteries of the First Mystery are terribly divine. It is clear that the work of the Great Work is contained in the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery. All the Mysteries of the First Mystery are found in the Four - and - Twentieth Myster y. The one who performs the Great Work has the right to enter all of the Orders above and below. It is easy to understand that the entire beginning and the end of the Great Work is in the Four - and - Twentieth Mystery. Of the second space “And of those who have received the mysteries in the order of the four - and - twenty mysteries, every one will go into the region in which he hath received mysteries, and he will have the power to pass through all the orders and spaces which are without him; but he hath not th e power to go into the higher orders which are above him or to pass through them.”"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 262 It is clear that those who have received Mysteries in the orders of the Four - and - Twentieth Mysteries have the right to live in the regions where they received the Mysterie s.

Of the unrepentant “If on the other hand those who shall receive mysteries of the mystery of the Ineffable and of the mysteries of the First Mystery, turn and sin and come out of the body without having repented, then they will be even as those will be who have transgressed and not repented.

CHAPTER 122 Jesus tri eth Peter Thereafter Jesus saw a woman who came to make repentance. He had baptized her three times, and yet she had not done what was worthy of the baptisms. And the Saviour desired to try Peter, to see if he was compassionate and forgiving, as he had co mmanded them. He said unto Peter: “Lo, three times have I baptized this soul, and yet at this third time she hath not done what is worthy of the mysteries of the Light. Wherefor then doth she make her body good for nothing? Now, therefore, Peter, perform t he mystery which cutteth off the souls from the inheritances of the Light; perform that mystery in order that it may cut off the soul of this woman from the inheritance of the Light.” When then the Saviour had said this, he tried [Peter] to see whether he was compassionate and forgiving. When then the Saviour had said this, Peter said; “My Lord, let her yet this time, that we may give her the higher mysteries; and if she is fit, then host thou let her inherit the Light - kingdom, but if she is not fit, then h ost thou [to] cut her off from the Light - kingdom.” When then Peter had said this, the Saviour knew that Peter was compassionate as he and forgiving. When then all this was said, the Saviour said unto his disciples; “Have ye understood all these words and t he type of this woman?’ Mary interpreteth the incident from a former saying Mary answered and said: “My Lord, I have understood the mysteries of the things which have fallen to this woman’s lot.

But f on the other hand he hath received the three mysteries in the two spaces or in the third from within, and he hath turned and transgressed, no mystery hearkeneth unto him to help him in his repentance, neither the higher nor the lower, save the mystery of the First Mystery and the mysteries of the Ineffable, -- it is they which hearken unto him and accept his repentance from him.” Mary answered and said: ‘My Lord, a man who hath received mysteries up to two or three in the second or third space, and he hath not transgressed, but is still in his faith in uprightness and without play - acting, [what will befall him]?’ There is no limit to the number of mysteries the faithful may receive And the Saviour answered and said unto Mary: “E very man who hath received mysteries in the second and in the third space, and hath not transgressed, but is still in his faith without play - acting, it is lawful for such an one to receive mysteries in the space which pleaseth him, from the first to the la st, because they have not transgressed.” "},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 313 CHAPTER 124 Mary continued again and said ‘My Lord, a man who hath known the godhead and hath received of the mysteries of the Light, and hath turned and transgressed and done lawlessly and hath not turned to repe nt, and a man on the other hand who hath not found the godhead nor known it, and that man is sinner and moreover impious, and they both have come out of the body, -- which of them will get more suffering in the judgments” The fate of the Gnostic who sinne th is more terrible than that of the ignorant sinner The Saviour answered again and said unto Mary: “Amen, amen, I say unto thee: The man who hath known the godhead and hath received the mysteries of the light, and sinned and hath not turned to repent, he will get suffering in the chastisements of the judgments in great sufferings and judgments exceedingly far more in comparison with the impious and law - breaking man who hath not know the godhead. Now, therefore, who hath ears to hear, let him hear. Mary i nterpreteth the same from a former saying When then the Saviour had said this, Mary started forward and said: “My Lord, my light - man hath ears, and I have understood the whole word which thou hast spoken. Concerning this word then thou hast spoken unto us in a similitude: The slave who knew the will of his lord and made not ready nor did the will of his lord, will receive great blows; but he who knew not and did not, will be deserving of less.

CHAPTER 13 0 Mary pleadeth for those who have neglected the mysteries And Mary continued and said unto the Saviour: “My Lord, if a man hath received the mysteries of the Light which [are] in the first space from without, and when the time of the mysteries up to whi ch they reach, is completed, and if that man continueth anew to receive mysteries of the mysteries which [are] within the mysteries which he hath already received, and moreover that man hath become negligent, not having prayed in the prayer which taketh aw ay the evil of the victuals which he eateth and drinketh, and through the evil of the victuals he is bound to the axle of the Fate of the rulers and through the necessity of the elements he hath sinned anew after the completion of the time up to which the mystery reacheth, -- because he hath become negligent and hath not prayed in the prayer which taketh away the evil of the souls and purifleth them, -- and that man is come out of the body before he hath repented anew and anew received the mysteries of the mysteries which [are] within the mysteries which he hath already received, -- those which accept repentance from him and forgive his sins, -- and when he came forth out of the body and we knew with certainty that they have carried him into the midst of the dragon of the outer darkness because of the sins which he committed, and that that man hath no helper in the world nor any one compassionate, that ye should perform the mystery of the Ineffable until he should be removed out of the midst of the dragon of the outer darkness and led into the Light - kingdom, -- now, therefore, my Lord, what will befall him until he save himself from the chastisements of the dragon of the outer darkness? By no means, O Lord, abandon him, because he hath endured sufferings in th e persecutions and in the whole godhood in which he is. “Now, therefore, O Saviour, have mercy with me, lest one of our kinsmen should be in such a type, and have mercy with all the souls which shall be in this type; for thou art the key which openeth the door of the universe and shutteth the door of the universe, and thy mystery comprehendeth them all Have then mercy, O Lord, with such souls. For they have called on the name of thy mysteries, [were it but] for one single day, and have truly had faith in th em and were not in play - acting. Give them then, O Lord, a gift in thy goodness and give them rest in thy mercy.” When then Mary had said this, the Saviour called her most exceedingly blessed because of the words, which she had spoken. And the Saviour was i n great compassion and said unto Mary: “Unto all men who shall be in this type of which thou hast spoken, unto them while they [are] still in life, give ye the mystery of one of the twelve names of the dungeons of the dragon of the outer darkness, -- those which I will give you when I have ended explaining unto you the universe from within without and from without within.

The rulers of the midst look after the counterfeiting spirit; arid also the destiny, whose name is Moira, leadeth the man until it hath him slain th rough the death appointed unto him, which the rulers of the great Fate have bound to the soul. And the servitors of the sphere bind the soul and the power and the counterfeiting spirit and the destiny. And they portion them all and make them into two porti ons and seek after the mart and also after the woman in the world to whom they have given signs, in order that they may send them into them. And they give one portion to the man and one portion to the woman in a victual of the world or in a breath of the a ir or in water or in a kind, which they drink. “All this I will tell unto you and the species of every soul and the type, how they enter into the bodies, whether of men or of birds or of cattle or of wild beasts or reptiles or of all the other species in t he world, I will tell you their type.

And when the number of months of the birth of the babe i s completed, the babe is born. Small in it is the compound of the power, and small in it is the soul; and small in it is the counterfeiting spirit. The destiny on the contrary is large, as it is not mingled into the body for their economy, but followeth th e soul and the body and the counterfeiting spirit, until the time when the soul shall come forth out of the body, on account of the type of death by which it shall slay it [the body] according to the death appointed for it by the rulers of the great Fate. Of how a man cometh by his death “Is he to die by a wild beast, the destiny leadeth the wild beast against him until it slay him; or is he to die by a serpent, or is he to fall into a pit by mischance, or is he to hang himself or is he to die in water, o r through such [kinds of death], or through another death which is worse or better than this, -- in a word, it is the destiny which forceth his death upon him.

And all the souls which are i n his chastisements are carried and cast back anew into the sphere, because they are reduced through his dark smoke and his wicked fire.” Of Yachthanabas Again he continued in the discourse and said unto his disciples: “The fifth order, whose ruler is ca lled Yachthanabas, is a mighty ruler under whom startdeth a multitude of other demons it is they which enter into men and bring it about that they have respect of persons, -- treating the just with injustice, and favour the cause of sinners, taking gifts f or a just judgment and perverting it, forgetting the poor and needy, -- they [demons] increasing the forgetfulness in their souls and the care for that which bringeth no benefit, in order that they may not think of their life, so that when they come out of the body, they are carried in ravishment. “The souls then which this ruler will carry off in ravishment are in his chastisements one - hundred - and - fifty years and eight months, and he destroyeth them through his dark smoke and his wicked fire, while they ar e exceedingly afflicted through the flames of his fire. ‘And when the sphere turneth itself and the little Sabaoth, the Good, who is called in the world Zeus, cometh, and he cometh to the eleventh aeon of the sphere which is called the Water - man, and when Boubastis cometh to the fifth aeon of the sphere which is called the Lion, then the veils which are between those of the Left and those of the Right, draw themselves aside, and there looketh out of the height the great Iao, the Good, he of the"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Pistis Sophia Unveiled Samael Aun Weor 342 Midst, on th e regions of Yachthanabas, so that his regions are dissolved and destroyed.

The complete unveiling will be completed at its proper time, hour, and space. It is urgent to organize the World Salvati on Army, based on the Living Church, the chosen people and the Perfect Matrimonies, that work intensely in the three Revolutionary Factors, in order for the new Celestial Jerusalem to be founded. Study and practice all the lessons with patience, temperance , loyalty and obedience to our Divine Mother and to our Divine Father, as well as to the Sacred Mysteries of our Holy Church. Drink the wisdom of the crystalline waters of immaculate whiteness. They contain the Tree of Philosophers, Wise Ones, Scientists a nd Religious Ones. The waters contain the non plus ultra, the summum matter, the Magnus Opus, the Elixir of Longevity, the origin of the body, of the Soul, of the Intimate, and of life; the word and the sexual force, the gleaming Dragon of Wisdom, the Alph a and the Omega, the Intimate Christ, the Internal God, the Beginning and the End, the Solar force that the intellectual humanoid needs to incarnate with himself. All these will not be found in any other place. The fountain of the water of life shall be gr anted by the grace of the Holy Spirit to the one who thirsts for it. Fortunate is the one who knows how to drink of the pure waters in the perfect matrimony, for such a one will never again be thirsty. Igneous, Aqua, Origo, IAO. However, to the unrepentant tenebrous ones, abominable killers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, liars, their part will be in the burning Avitchi, with fire and Sulphur. This is the Second Death. Answer, be sincere with yourselves, place your hand over your heart, ask your Divine Mother Kundalini for advice, and answer with sincerity. Have you Self - realized yourself? Will your theories or doctrines convert you into angels? What have you gained? What have you obtained from the many theories and doctrines? Never in the history of th e centuries has anyone been known to have christified himself without the Perfect Matrimony, without the seminal transmutation, and without the help of the Divine Mother Kundalini. With Her, you can raise the three scales of imagination, inspiration, and i ntuition, so that you can enter into the Celestial Jerusalem that follows the Great Cataclysm. Woe to the one who adds or takes away words from this Book and its unveiling, for we verily warn that the Eternal will place the most horrible grief upon such a rebel. Those who testify these things say, surely we come quickly. Amen, so be it. Inverential Peace Tradux: D. of the I.G. and of the F.B. Elohim Agni Tao M.S.T.
