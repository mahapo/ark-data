[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Nag Hammadi Library B I B L I O T H È Q U E D E N A G H A M M A D I Introduction from « The Gnostic Gos pels » by Elaine Pagels In December 1945 an Arab peasant made an astonishing archeolo gical discovery in Upper Egypt. Rumors obscured the circumsta nces of this find--perhaps because the discovery was accidental, and its sale on the black market illegal. For years even the identity of the discoverer remained unknow n. One rumor held that he was a blood avenger; another, that he had made the find near the town of Naj 'Hamm ádì at the Jabal al-Tárif, a mounta in honeycombed with more than 150 caves. Originally natural, some of these caves were cut and painted and used as grave sites as early as the sixth dynasty, some 4,300 years ago. Thirty years later the discoverer himself, Muhammad 'Alí al-Sammán; told what happened. Shortly before he and his brothers avenged their father's murder in a blood feud, they had saddled their camels and gone out to the Jabal to dig for saba kh, a soft soil they used to fertilize their crops. Digging around a massiv e boulder, they hit a red earthen ware jar, almost a meter high. Muhamma d 'Alí hesitated to break the jar, consider ing that a jinn , or spirit, might live inside. But realizing that it might also contai n gold, he raised his mattock, smashed the jar, and discovered inside thirtee n papyrus books, bound in leather. Returning to his home in al-Qasr, Muhammad 'All dumped the books and loose papyrus leaves on the straw piled on the groun d next to the oven. Muha mmad's mother, 'Umm -Ahmad, admits that she burned much of the papyrus in the oven along with the straw she used to kindle the fire. A few weeks later, as Muhamma d 'Alí tells it, he and his brothers avenged their father's death by murdering Ahmed Isma'il. Their mother had warned her sons to keep their mattocks sharp: when they learned that their father's enemy was nearby, the brothers seized the opportunity, \"hacked off his limbs . . . ripped out his heart, and devoured it among them, as the ultimate act of blood revenge.\" - 1 -"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Fearing that the police investigating the murder would search his house and discover the books, Muhamma d 'Alí asked the priest, al-Qummus Basiliyus Abd al-Masih, to keep one or more for him. During the time that Muhammad 'Alí and his brothers were being interrogated for murder, Raghib, a local history teacher, had seen one of the books, and suspected that it had value. Having received one from al-Qummus Basiliyus, Raghib sent it to a friend in Cairo to find out its worth. Sold on the black market through antiquities dealers in Cairo, the manuscr ipts soon attracted the attentio n of officials of the Egyptian government. Through circumstan ces of high drama, as we shall see, they bought one and confiscated ten and a half of the thirteen leather-bound books, called codices, and deposited them in the Coptic Museum in Cairo. But a large part of the thirtee nth codex, contai ning five extraordinary texts, was smuggled out of Egypt and offered for sale in Amer ica. Word of this codex soon reached Professor Gilles Quispel, distinguished historian of religion at Utrec ht, in the Netherla nds. Excited by the discovery, Quispel urged the Jung Founda tion in Zurich to buy the codex. But discovering, when he succeeded, that some pages were missing, he flew to Egypt in the spring of 1955 to try to find them in the Coptic Museum. Arriving in Cairo, he went at once to the Coptic Museum, borrowed photog raphs of some of the texts, and hurried back to his hotel to decipher them. Tracing out the first line, Quispel was startled, then incredulous, to read: \"These are the secret words which the living Jesus spoke, and which the twin, Judas Thomas, wrote down.\" Quispel knew that his colleague H.C. Puech , using notes from another French scholar, Jean Doresse, had identified the opening lines with fragments of a Greek Gospe l of Thomas discovered in the 1890's. But the discovery of the whole text raised new questi ons: Did Jesus have a twin brother, as this text implies? Could the text be an authent ic record of Jesus' sayings? According to its title, it contai ned the Gospel According to Thomas ; yet, unlike the gospels of the New Testament, this text identified itself as a secret gospel. Quispel also discovered that it contained many sayings known from the New Testament; but these sayings, placed in unfam iliar contexts, suggested other dimensio ns of meaning. Other passages, Quispel found, differed entire ly from any know n Christian traditio n: the \"living Jesus,\" for example, speaks in sayings as cryptic and compelling as Zen koans: Jesus said, \"If you bri ng forth what is within you, what you br ing forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you. \" What Quispel held in his hand, the Gospel of Thomas, was only one of the fifty-two texts discovered at Nag Hammadi (the usual English transliteration of the town's name). Boun d into the same volume with it is the Gospel of Phil ip, which attributes to Jesus acts and sayings quite different from those in the New Testament: . . . the compa nion of the [Savior is] Mary Magdalene. [But Christ loved] her more than [all] the disciples, and used to kiss her [often] on her [mouth]. The rest of [the disciples were offended] . . . They said to him, \"Why do you love her more than all of us?\" The Savior answe red and said to them, \"Why do I not love you as (I love) her?\" Other sayings in this collection criticize common Christian beliefs, such as the virgin birth or the bodily resurrection, as naïve misunderstan dings. Bound together with these gospe ls is the Apo cryphon (literally, \"secret book\") of John, which opens with an offer to reveal \"the mysteries [and the] things hidde n in silence\" which Jesus taught to his disciple John. Muhamma d 'Alí later admitted that some of the texts were lost--burned up or thrown away. But what remains is astonish ing: some fifty-two texts from the early centuri es of the Christia n era-- including a collec tion of early Christian gospels, previously unkno wn. Besides the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Phil ip, the find included the Gospe l of Truth and the Gospel to the Egyp tians, which identi fies itself as \"the [sacred book] of the Great Invisible [Spirit].\" Another group of texts consists of writings attributed to Jesus' followers, such as the Secret Book of Jame s, the Apo calypse of Paul, the Letter of Peter to Philip, and the Apo calypse of Peter. What Muhammad 'Alí discov ered at Nag Hammadi, it soon became clear, were Copti c translat ions, made about 1,500 years ago, of still more ancient manuscr ipts. The origin als themse lves had been writte n in Greek, the langua ge of the New Testament: as Doresse, Pue ch, and Quispe l had recognized, part of one of them had been discovered by archeo logists about fifty - 2 -"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"years earlier, when they found a few fragments of the original Greek version of the Gospe l of Thomas. About the dating of the manuscripts themselv es there is little debate. Examinatio n of the datable papyrus used to thicken the leather bindings, and of the Coptic script, place them c. A.D. 350-400. But scholars sharply disagree about the dating of the original texts. Some of them can hardly be later than c . A.D. 120-150, since Irenaeus, the orthodox Bishop of Lyons, writin g C. 180, declares that heretics \"boast that they possess more gospels than there really are,'' and compla ins that in his time such writings already have won wide circulation--from Gaul through Rome, Greece, and Asia Minor. Quispe l and his collaborators, who first published the Gospel of Thomas, suggested the date of c. A.D. 140 for the original. Some reasoned that since these gospe ls were hereti cal, they must have been writte n later than the gospe ls of the New Testam ent, which are dated c. 60-l l0. But recently Professor Helmut Koester of Har vard University has suggested that the collection of sayings in the Gospel of Thomas, althoug h compiled c. 140, may include some traditions even older than the gospe ls of the New Testament, \"possib ly as early as the second half of the first century\" (50-100)-- as ear ly as, or earlier, than Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John. Scholars investigating the Nag Hammadi find discovered that some of the texts tell the origin of the human race in terms very different from the us ual reading of Genesis: the Test imony of Truth, for example, tells the story of the Garden of Eden from the viewpoint of the serpent! Here the serpent, long known to appear in Gnostic literature as the principle of divine wisdom, convinces Adam and Eve to partake of know ledge while \"the Lord\" threatens them with death, trying jealously to prevent them from attaining know ledge, and expelling them from Paradise when they achieve it. Another text, mysteriously entitled The Thunder, Perfect Mind, offers an extraordinary poem spoken in the voice of a feminine divine power: For I am the first and the last. I am the honor ed one and the scorned one. I am the whore and the holy one. I am the wife and the virgin.... I am the barren one, and many are her sons.... I am the silence that is incompre hensible.... I am the utterance of my name. These diverse texts range, then, from secret gospels, poems, and quasi-philosophic descriptions of the origin of the universe, to myths, magic, and instructions for mystical practi ce. Why were these texts buried-and why have they remained virtua lly unkno wn for nearly 2,000 years? Their suppre ssion as banned documents, and their burial on the cliff at Nag Hamm adi, it turns out, were both part of a struggle critical for the formatio n of early Christia nity. The Nag Hamm adi texts, and others like them, which circulated at the beginning of the Christi an era, were denoun ced as heresy by orthodox Christians in the middle of the second century. We have long known that many early followers of Christ were condemned by other Christi ans as heretics, but nearly all we knew about them came from what their opponents wrote attacking them. Bishop Irenaeus, who supervis ed the church in Lyons, c. 180, wrote five volumes, entitled The Destruction and Overthrow of Falsely So-ca lled Know ledge, which begin with his promise to set forth the views of those who are now teaching heresy . . . to show how absurd and inconsistent with the truth are their statements . . . I do this so that . . . you may urge all those with whom you are connected to avoid such an abyss of madness and of blasphemy against Christ. He denounces as especially \"full of blasphemy \" a famous gospe l called the Gospel of Truth. Is Irenaeus referri ng to the same Gospe l of Truth discovered at Nag Hammadi' Quispel and his collaborators, who first published the Gospe l of Truth, argued that he is; one of their critics maintai ns that the opening line (which begins \"The gospe l of truth\") is not a title. But Irenaeus does use the same source as at least one of the texts discovered at Nag Hammad i--the Apo cryphon (Secret Book) of John-- as ammunit ion for his own attack on such \"heresy.\" Fifty years later Hippolytus, a teacher in Rome, wrote another massive Refutation of All Heresies to \"expose and refute the wicked blasp hemy of the heretics.\" - 3 -"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"This campaign against heresy involved an involuntary admission of its persuasive power; yet the bishop s prevailed. By the time of the Emperor Constantine's conversion, when Christia nity became an officially approved religion in the fourth century, Christian bishops, previously victimized by the police, now commanded them. Possession of books denoun ced as heretical was made a criminal offense. Copies of such books were burned and destroyed. But in Upper Egypt, someone; possibl y a monk from a nearby monastery of St. Pachom ius, took the banned books and hid them from destruction--in the jar where they remained buried for almost 1,600 years. But those who wrote and circulated these texts did not regard thems elve s as \"heretic s. Most of the writings use Christian termino logy, unmistaka ble related to a Jewish heritage. Many claim to offer tradition s about Jesus that are secret, hidden from \"the many\" who constitute what, in the second centur y, came to be called the \"catholic church.\" These Christia ns are now called gnostics, from the Greek word gnosi s, usually translated as \"knowledge.\" For as those who claim to know nothing about ultimate reality are called agnostic (literally, \"not knowin g\"), the person who does claim to know such things is called gnosti c (\"knowing\"). But gnosis is not primarily rational knowledge. The Greek languag e distinguishes between scientific or reflect ive knowledge (\"He knows mathema tics\") and know ing through observatio n or experien ce (\"He knows me\"), which is gnosis. As the gnostics use the term, we could translate it as \"insight,\" for gnosis involves an intuitive process of knowi ng onesel f. And to know oneself, they claimed, is to know human nature and human destiny. According to the gnostic teacher Theodotus, writing in Asia Minor (c. 140-160), the gnosti c is one has come to understand who we were, and what we have become; where we were... whither we are hasten ing; from what we are being released; what birth is, and what is rebirth . Yet to know onesel f, at the deepest level, is simultaneous ly to know God; this is the secret of gnosi s. Another gnostic teacher, Monoimus, says: Abandon the search for God and the creation and other matters of a similar sort. Look for him by taking yourself as the starting point. Learn who it is within you who makes everyth ing his own and says, \"My God, my mind, my thought, my soul, my body.\" Learn the sources of sorrow: , joy, love, hate . . . If you carefully investigate these matters you wi ll find him in yourse lf . What Muhammad 'All discovered at Nag Hammad i is, apparently, a library of writings, almost all of them gnosti c. Although they claim to offer secret teaching, many of these texts refer to the Scriptures of the Old Testament, and others to the letters of Paul and the New Testament gospels. Many of them include the same drama tic personae as the New Testament- -Jesus and his discip les. Yet th e differen ces are striki ng. Orthodox Jews and Christ ians insist that a chasm separates humanity from Its creator: God is wholly other. But some of the gnosti cs who wrote these gospels contrad ict this: self-knowledge is know ledge of God; th e self and the divine are identical. Second, the \"living Jesus\" of these texts speaks of illusion and enlightenment, not of sin and repentance, like the Jesus of the New Testament. Instead of comin g to save us from sin, he comes as a guide who opens access to spiritual understandi ng. But when the disciple attains enlightenment, Jesus no longer serves as his spiritua l master: the two have becom e equal --even identical. Third, orthodox Christ ians believe that Jesus is Lord and Son of God in a unique way: he remains forever distinct from the rest of humanity whom he came to save. Yet the gnosti c Gospe l of Thomas relates that as soon as Thomas recognizes him, Jesus says to Thomas that they have both received their being from the same sourc e: Jesus said, \"I am not your master. Because you have drunk, you have becom e drunk from the bubbling stream which I have measured out.... He who will drink from my mouth will become as I am: I myself shall become he, and the things that are hidden will be revealed to him.\" Does not such teaching--the identi ty of the divine and human. the concern with illusion and enlightenment, the founder who is presented not as Lord, but as spiritual guide sound more Eastern than Western? Some scholars have suggested that if the names were changed, the \"living - 4 -"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Buddh a\" appropriately could say what the Gospe l of Thomas attributes to the living Jesus. Could Hindu or Bud dhist traditio n have influenced gnosti cism? The British schola r of Buddhism, Edward Conze, suggests that it had. He points out that \"Buddhists were in contact with the Thom as Christians (that is, Christians who knew and used such writings as the Gospel of Thomas) in South India.\" Trade routes betwee n the Greco- Roman world and the Far East were openi ng up at the time when gnosti cism flourished (A.D. 80-200); for generation s, Buddhist missionaries had been proselytiz ing in Alexandria. We note, too, that Hippolytus, who was a Greek speaking Christian in Rome (c. 225), knows of the Indian Brahmins--and includes their traditio n among the sources of heresy: There is . . . amon g the Indians a heresy of those who philosop hize among the Brahmi ns, who live a self-sufficient life, abstaining from (eating) living creatures and all cooked food . . . They say that God is light, not like the light one sees, nor like the sun nor fire, but to them God is discourse, not that which finds expressio n in articul ate sounds, but that of knowledge (gnosis) through which the secret mysteries of nature are percei ved by the wise. Could the title of the Gospel of Thomas-- named for the disciple who, tradition tells us, went to India--suggest the influence of India n traditio n? These hints indicate the possibility, yet our evide nce is not conclusive. Since parallel traditions may emerge in different cultures at different times, such ideas could have developed in both places indepen dently. What we call Eastern and Western religio ns, and tend to regard as separate streams, were not clearly differentiated 2,000 years ago. Research on the Nag Hammadi texts is only beginning: we look forward to the work of scholars who can study these traditio ns comparatively to discover whet her they can, in fact, be traced to Indian sources. Even so, ideas that we associate with Eastern religions emerg ed in the first century through the gnosti c movement in the West, but they were suppressed and condemned by polemicists like Irenaeus. Yet those who called gnosticism heresy were adopting --consciously or not--the viewpoint of that group of Christians who called themsel ves orthodox Christ ians. A heretic may be anyone whose outlook someone else dislikes or denoun ces. According to tradition, a heretic is one who deviates from the true faith. But what defines that \"true faith\"? Who calls it that, and for what reasons? We find this problem familiar in our own experien ce. The term \"Christi anity,\" especially since the Refor mation, has covered an astonishing range of groups. Those claiming to represent \"true Christi anity\" in the twenti eth centur y can range from a Catholic cardinal in the Vatican to an African Method ist Episcopal preacher initiating revival in Detroit, a Mormon missionary in Thailand, or the memb er of a village church on the coast of Greece . Yet Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox agree that such diversity is a recent- -and deplorable--devel opment. Accord ing to Christi an legend , the early church was different. Christians of every persuasion look back to the primiti ve church to find a simpler, purer form of Christi an faith. In the apostles' time, all members of the Christian community shared their money and property; all believed the same teaching, and worshipped together; all revered the authority of the apostles. It was only after that golden age that conflict, then heresy emerged: so says the author of the Acts of the Apostle s, who identifies himse lf as the first histor ian of Christ ianity. But the discoveries at Nag Hammadi have upset this picture. If we admit that some of these fifty- two texts represents early forms of Christian teachi ng, we may have to recognize that early Christi anity is far more diverse than nearly anyone expected before the Nag Hammadi discoveries. Contemporar y Christianity, diverse and complex as we find it, actually may show more unani mity than the Christ ian churches of the first and second centur ies. For nearly all Christians since that time, Catholics, Protestants, or Orthodox, have shared three basic premises. First, they accept the canon of the New Testament; second, they confess the apostolic creed; and third, they affirm specif ic forms of church institution. But every one of these- the canon of Scripture, the creed, and the institutional structure- -emerged in its present form only toward the end of the second centur y. Before that time, as Irenaeus and others attest, numerous gospe ls circulated among - 5 -"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"various Christian groups, ranging from those of the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, to such writings as the Gospe l of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip , and the Gospel of Truth, as well as many other secret teachings, myths, and poems attribute d to Jesus or his disciples. Some of these, apparently, were discovered at Nag Hammad i; many others are lost to us. Those who identified themselves as Christia ns entertained many- -and radically differing-religious beliefs and practi ces. And the communities scattered throughout the known world organized themselves in ways that differed widel y from on e group to another. Yet by A. D. 200, the situation had changed. Christ ianity had become an institution headed by a three- rank hierarchy of bishops, priests, and deacons, who understood themselv es to be the guard ians of the only \"true faith.\" The majority of churches, among which the church of Rome took a leading role, rejected all other viewpoints as heresy. Deploring the diversity of the earlier move ment, Bishop Irenaeus and his followers insisted that there could be only one church, and outside of that church, he declared, \"there is no salvat ion.\" Members of this church alone are orthodox (literally, \"straigh t-thinking\") Christians. And, he claimed, this church must be cathol ic-- that is, universal. Whoever challenged that consensus, arguing instead for other forms of Christ ian teaching, was declared to be a heretic , and expelled. When the orthodox gained military support, sometime after the Emperor Constant ine became Christian in the fourth century, the penalty for heresy escalated. The Nag Hammadi discovery of manuscripts In December 1945, two peasants, Muhammed and Khalifah 'Ali of the al-Samman clan were diggin g for fertiliser at the base of the Jabal al-Tarif cliff, using the saddle-bags of their camels to carry the earth back. The cliff is about 11km north -east of Nag Hammad i. They tethered their camels to a boulder, and came upon a buried jar as they were digging around the base of the boulder. Muhammed 'Ali told J.M.Rob inson that at first he was afraid to break the jar -- the lid may have been sealed with bitume n, as a blackish substance is present on the lid -- for fear a jinn might be inside , but the thought that gold might be contai ned instead, he broke it with his mattock. Out flew particles of papyrus. The jar was of red slip ware, with four small handle s near the openi ng. It was large, approximately 60cm or more in height, with an openin g of some 15- 20cm widening to 30cm in the side. The jar had been closed by fitting a bowl into its mouth. The bowl survives, and is Copti c red slip ware of the 4-5th century, with a rim decorated with four fields of stripes. The diameter at the outer edge is 23.3-24.0 cm, with inside diameter of 18.2- 18.7cm. The books were divided among the 7 camel -drivers present. According to 'Ali there were 13 (our 'codex XIII' was not included in this number, as it was inside codex VI). Thus a codex was lost more or less at the site. Seven lots were drawn up. Covers were removed and each consisted of a complete codex plus part of another. The other drivers, ignorant of the value and afraid of sorcery and Muhammed 'Ali, disclaimed any share, whereon he piled them all back together. 'Ali wrapped his books in his tunic and took them home, to his hovel in the hamlet of al-Qasr, built on the site of ancient Cheno boskion. The books, loose covers and loose pages were dumped in the straw, next to the oven. A blood -feud was in progress, for which reason Muhammed 'Ali was very careful not to venture back later to the area. Muhammed deposited the books with a local coptic priest, Basiliyus 'Abd al-Masih, as the police were searching his house almost nightly for weapons. The priest' s wife had a brother, Raghib Andra wus, who went from village to village teaching English and history in the local coptic church schools. He came to visit, and, on seeing one of the books, recognised it might be valua ble and took it to Cairo. There he showed it to a Copti c physi cian intereste d in the Coptic language, Georg e Sobhi, who called in the authorit ies from the Department of Antiquities. They seized the book, agreeing to pay Raghi b £E 300. After endless haggl ing, he got £E 250, on condition he donated the remain ing £E 50 to the Coptic Museum. The book was deposited in the museum, accord ing to the register, on 4th Octob er 1946. Thinking the books were worth less, or maybe even unlucky to have, 'Ali's widow ed mother 'Umm Ahmad had burned part of those lying in the straw in the oven (probably the covers and most of - 6 -"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the pages of codex XII, of which only a few leaves remain, but also the cover of X, and loose leaves: 1 in codex II, 9 in III, 1 in VI, 3 in VIII and 2 in IX, and large and small fragme nts from otherwi se intact sequences of fragments), as she conceded to Robinson. Illiterate Muslim neighbou rs bartered or purchased them for next to nothing. Nashid Bisadah had one and entruste d it to a gold merchant of Nag Hammadi to sell in Cairo, dividing the profit between them. A grain merchant supposedly acquired another and sold it for such a price that he ws able to set up his shop in Cairo. Bahij 'Ali, a one-eyed outlaw of al-Qasr, got a number of the books. Escor ted by a well-known antiquities dealer of the region, Dhaki Basta, he went to Cairo. They first offered the books to Mansoor's shop at Shepheard 's hotel, and then to the shop of Phokion J. Tano, a Cypriot dealer, who bought the lot and then went to Nag Hamm adi to get whatever was left. Once the news of the value of the books reached al-Qasr, the 'Ali brothers tried to lay hands on the remainder. Most of Codex I was exported from Egypt by a Belgian antiques dealer, Albert Eid. He offered it for sale in New York and Ann Arbor in 1949, and then his widow sold it on 10th May 1952 to the Jung Institute of Zurich. It was return ed to Cairo bit by bit after publication. Meanw hile Tano's collection was seized by the Egyptian Department of Antiquities to prevent it being expor ted; when Nasser c ame to powe r, it was 'natio nalised', a paltry £E 4,000 being paid as compensatio n.

US scholar James Robinson became intereste d in the 1960's, and using contacts at UNESCO was able eventually to bypass this exhibition of obscurantism.

Gnos is and gnos ticism are still rather arcane terms, though in the last two decades the words have been increasingly encou ntered in the vocabulary of contemporary society. Gnos is derives from Greek, and connotes \"knowledge\" or the \"act of know ing\". (On first hearing, it is someti mes confused with anoth er more common term of the same root but opposi te sense: agnost ic , literally \"not know ing\", a knower of nothing.) The Greek language differentiates between rational, proposi tional knowl edge, and the distinct form of know ing obtained not by reason, but by personal experience or perception. It is this latter knowledge, gained from experience, from an interior spark of comprehension, that constitutes gnos is . 1 In the first century of the Christian era this term, Gnos tic, began to be used to denote a prominent, even if somewhat heterodox, segment of the diverse new Christ ian commun ity. Among these early followers of Christ, it appears that an elite group delineated themselves from the greater house hold of the Church by claiming not simply a belief in Christ and his message, but a \"special witness\" or revelatory experience of the divine. It was this experien ce, this gnosis, which--so these Gnosti cs claimed--set the true follower of Christ apart from his fellows. Stephan Hoeller explain s that these Gnostic Christ ians held a \"conv iction that direct, personal and absolute know ledge of the authenti c truths of existence is access ible to human beings, and, moreover, that the attainme nt of such knowl edge must always constitute the supreme ach ievement of human life.\" 2 What the \"authentic truths of existence\" affirmed by the Gnostic s were will be briefly review ed below. But a historical overv iew of the early Churc h might first be useful. In the initial decades of the Christian church--the period when we find first mentio n of \"Gnosti c\" Christ ians--no orthodoxy, or single acceptab le format of Christian thought, had yet been defined. During this first century of Christianity modern scholarship suggests Gnostic ism was one of many currents sweeping the deep waters of the new religion. The ultimate course Christianity, and Western culture with it, would take was undecided at that early moment; Gnosticism was one of forces forming that destiny. That Gnostic ism was, at least briefly, in the mainstream of Christianity is witnessed by the fact that one of the most prominent and influential early Gnosti c teachers, Valent inus, may have been in considerat ion during the mid-second century for election as the Bishop of Rome. 3 Valent inus serves well as a model of the Gnostic teacher. Born in Alexandria around A.D. 100, in his early years Valentinus had distinguished himself as an extraordinary teacher and leader in the highly educated and diverse Alexandrian Christian community. In the middle of his life, around A.D. 140, he migrated from Alexandria to the Churc h's evolving capital, Rome, where he played an active role in the public life of the Church. A prime characteristic of the Gnostics was their propensi ty for claiming to be keepers of secret teachings, gospel s, traditions, rituals, and successions within the Church -- sacred matters for which many Christians were (in Gnosti c opinion) simply either not prepar ed or not properly inclined. Valentinus, true to this Gnostic penchant, professed a special apostolic sancti on. He mainta ined he had been personall y initiated by one Theudas, a disciple and initiate of the Apostl e Paul, and that he possessed know ledge of teachings and perhaps rituals which were being forgotten by the develop ing opposition that became Christ ian orthodoxy . 4 Thoug h an influential member of the Roman churc h in the mid- 1 1 Bentley Layton, The Gnostic Scriptu res (New York, 1987), p.9.

Gnostic ism's secret knowl edge, its continuing revelations and productio n of new scripture, its ascetheticism and paradoxical ly contrast ing libertine postures, were met with increasing suspicion. By A.D. 180, Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon, was publishing his attacks on Gnostic ism as heresy, a work to be continued with increasing vehemence by the orthodox church Fathers throughout the next centur y. The orthodox catholic church was deeply and profound ly influenced by the struggle against Gnosti cism in the second and third centuri es. Formulations of many centra l traditions in orthodox theology came as reflections and shadows of this confrontation with the Gnosis. 5 But by the end of the fourth century the struggle with the classical Gnostic ism represented in the Nag Hamm adi texts was essentia lly over; the evolving orthodox eccles ia had added the force of political correctness to dogmatic denun ciation, and with this sword so-called \"heresy\" was painfully cut from the Christian body. Gnosticism, which had perhaps alread y passe d its prime, was eradicated, its remaining teachers murdered or driven into exile, and its sacred books destroyed. All that remained for scholars seeking to understand Gnosti cism in later centuries were the denunci ations and fragments preserved in the patristic heresiol ogies -- or so it seem, until until a day in 1945.... Discovery of the Nag Hamm adi Library It was on a December day in the year of 1945, near the town of Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt, that the course of Gnosti c studies was radically renewed and forever changed. An Arab peasant, diggin g around a boulder in search of fertilizer for his fields, happened upon an old, rather large red earthen ware jar. Hoping to have found buried treasure , and with due hesitation and apprehens ion about the jinn, the genie or spirit who might attend such an hoard, he smashed the jar open with his pick. Inside he discovered no treasure and no genie, but books: more than a dozen old papyrus books, bound in golden brown leather. 6 Little did he realize that he had found an extraordinary collection of ancient texts, manuscripts hidden up a millennium and a half before (probably deposite d in the jar around the year 390 by monk s from the nearby monastery of St. Pachom ius) to escape destruction under order of the emerging orthodox Church in its violent expungi ng of all heterodoxy and heresy. How the Nag Hammadi manuscri pts eventual ly passed into scholarly hands is a fascinating even if too lengthy story to here relate. But today, now over fifty years since being unear thed and more than two decades after final translat ion and publication in English as The Nag Hammadi Library 7 , their importance has become astoundin gly clear: These thirteen beautifu l papyrus codices containing fifty-two sacred texts are the long lost \"Gnostic Gospel s\", a last extant testament of what orthodox Christianity perceived to be its most dangerous and insidious challenge, the feared opponent that the Patristi c heresiolog ists had reviled under many different names, but most commonly as Gnosti cism. The discovery of these documents has radically revised our understand ing of Gnosticism and the early Christian church. Overview of Gnostic Teachings With that abbreviated histori cal interlude completed, we might again ask, \"What was it that these \"knowe rs\" knew?\" What made them such dangerous heretics ? The complexities of Gnosticism are legion, making any general izations wisely suspect. While several systems for defining and categorizing Gnosticism have been proposed over the years, none has yet gained any general 5 Giovanni Filoramo, A History of Gn ostici sm (Oxford, 1990), p. 5. 6 We should here note, given recent extensive discussions about the Dead Sea Scrolls, that the Nag Hammadi find is entirely separate and differe nt from that much publicized discovery of ancient Jewish texts. Discovered beginning in 1947, two years after the Nag Hammadi texts were found, these records now known as the Dead Sea Scrolls wer e apparently the posses sions of Essene communities residing near Qumran in Palestin e at a time around the beginning of the Christia n era. 7 J.

The first essential chara cteristic of Gnostic ism was introduced above: Gnostic ism asserts that \"direct, personal and absolute knowledge of the authent ic truths of existence is access ible to human beings,\" and that the attainm ent of such knowledge is the supreme achievement of huma n life. Gnos is, rememb er, is not a rationa l, propositio nal, logical understanding, but a knowing acquired by experience . The Gnostics were not much interested in dogma or coherent, rational theology--a fact which makes the study of Gnosti cism particularly difficult for individuals with \"bookkeeper mental ities\". (Perhaps for this very same reason, consideration of the Gnostic vision is often a most gratify ing undertaki ng for persons gifted with a poetic ear.) One simply cannot cipher up Gnosticism into syllogistic dogmatic affirmati ons. The Gnostics cherished the ongoi ng force of divine revelation-- Gnos is was the creative experien ce of revelatio n, a rushin g progression of understan ding, and not a static creed. Carl Gustav Jung, the great Swiss psycho logist and a life- long student of Gnosticism in its various historical permutations, affirms, we find in Gnosticism what was lacking in the centuries that followed: a belief in the efficacy of individual revel ation and individual knowledge. This belief was rooted in the proud feeling of man's affinity with the gods... In his recent popular study, The American Relig ion , Harold Bloom suggest s a second chara cteristic of Gnosticism that might help us conceptua lly circumscribe its mysterious heart. Gnostic ism, says Bloom, \"is a knowi ng, by and of an uncreated self, or self-within-the self, and [this] knowledge leads to freedom....\" 9 Primary among all the revelatory percepti ons a Gnostic might reach was the profound awakeni ng that came with knowl edge that somethin g within him was uncreated. The Gnosti cs called this \"uncreated self\" the divine seed, the pearl, the spark of knowin g: consciousness, intelligence, light. And this seed of intellect was the self-same substan ce of God, it was man's authent ic reality; it was the glory of humankind and the divine alike. If woman or man truly came to gnosis of this spark, she understood that she was truly free: Not contingent, not a conception of sin, not a flawed crust of flesh, but the stuff of God, and the conduit of God's immane nt realization. There was always a paradoxical cognizance of duality in experienc ing this \"self-within-a-self\". How could it not be paradoxical: By all rationa l perceptio n, man clearly was not God, and yet in essential truth, was Godly. This conundrum was a Gnostic mystery, and its know ing was their greatest treasure. The creator god, the one who claimed in evolving orthodox dogma to have made man, and to own him, the god who would have man contingent upon him, born ex nihilo by his will, was a lying demon and not God at all. Gnostics called him by many names -- many of them deprecatory -- names like \"Saklas\", the blind one; \"Samael\", god of the blind; or \"the Demiurge\", the lesser power. Theodotus, a Gnostic teacher writing in Asia Minor betwee n A.D. 140 and 160, explained that the sacred strength of gnosis reveals \"who we were, what we have become, where we have been cast out of, where we are bound for, what we have been purifi ed of, what generation and regeneration are.\" 10 \" Yet\", the emine nt scholar of Gnosti cism, Elaine Pagels, comments in exegesis , \"to know oneself, at the deepest level, is simultaneousl y to know God: this is the secret of gnos is... . Self- know ledge is knowledge of God; the self and the divine are ident ical.\" 11 The Gosp el of Thomas , one of the Gnostic texts found preserved in the Nag Hammad i Library, gives these words of the living Jesus: Jesus said, `I am not your master. Because you have drunk, you have become drunk from the bubbling stream which I have me asured out... 12 8 An excellent summary of these appears in: Stephan Hoeller, \"What is a Gnostic?\" Gn osis: A Journ al of Wester n Inn er Tra diti ons 23 (Spring, 1992), pp. 24-27. 9 Bloom, p. 49. 10 Clemens Alexand rinus, Exerpta ex th eodo to 78.2. 11 Pagels, pp. xix-xx. 12 Go spe l of Th om as , 35.4-7, NHL. - 1 0 -"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"He who will drink from my mouth will become as I am: I mysel f shall become he, and the things that are hidden will be reve aled t o him.’ 13 He who will drink from my mouth will become as I am : What a remarkably heretical image! The Gospel of Thomas , from which we take that text, is an extraordinary scripture. Professor Helmut Koester of Harvard University notes that though ultimately this Gospel was condem ned and destroyed by the evolv ing orthodox church, it may be as old or older than the four canonical gospels preserve d, and even have served as a source document to them. 14 This brings us to the third promine nt element in our brief summary of Gnostic ism: its reveren ce for texts and scriptures unacc epted by the orthod ox fold. The Gnosti c experien ce was mythopoetic -- in story and allegory, and perhaps also in ritual enactme nts, Gnosticism sought expres sion of subtle, visionary insights inexpress ible by rational proposition or dogmatic affirmation. For the Gnosti cs, revelatio n was the nature of Gnosis: and for all the visions vouchsafed them, they affirmed a certai nty that God would yet reveal many great and wonderful things. Irritated by their profusio n of \"inspired texts\" and myths--most particularly their penchant for amplifying the story of Adam and Eve, and of the spiritual creation which they viewed as preceding the material realization of creation 15 - Ireneaus complains in his classic second century refutatio n of Gnosti cism, that every one of them generates something new, day by day, according to his ability; for no one is deemed perfect [ or, ma ture], who does not develop...s ome mighty ficti on. 16 The fourth characteristic that we might delineate to understand classical Gnostic ism is the most difficult of the four to succinctly untang le, and also one of the most disturbi ng to subseq uent orthodox theology. This is the image of God as a diad or duality. While affirming the ultimate unity and integrit y of the Divine, Gnostic ism noted in its experiential encounter with the numinous, dualis tic, contrast ing manifestatio ns and qualities. Consider the Gnostic affirmation that man, in some essential reality, is also God. This is a statement tinged with duality: Man, though not God, is. Another idea, offered by the Manichaean gnostic Faustus, that both matter ( hyle ) and the divine spirit are uncreated and coeternal was violently attacked by August ine in his essay Contra Faustum as hereti cal, dualistic thinking. 17 In many of the Nag Hammadi Gnosti c texts God is imaged not just as a duality, or diad, but as a unity of masculine and feminine elements. Though their language is specif ically Christian and unmistaka bly related to the Jewish tradition, Gnostic source s continually use sexual symbol ism to describe God. Prof . Pagels explai ns, One group of gnos tic sources claims to have received a secret tradition from Jesus through James and through M ary Ma gdalene [who the Gnos tics revered as consor t to Jesus]. Members of this group prayed to both the divin e Father and Mother: `From Thee, Father, and through Thee, Mother, the two immortal names, Parents of the divine being, and t hou, dweller in heaven, humani ty, of the migh ty name ...’ 18 Several trends within Gnosticism saw in God a union of two disparate natures , a union well imaged with sexual symbolism. Gnostics honored the feminine nature and, in reflection, Prof. Elaine Pagels has argued that Christian Gnostic women enjoyed a far greater degree of social and ecclesiastical equal ity than their orthodox sisters. Jesus himsel f, taught some Gnostics, had prefigur ed this mystic relationship: His most beloved discip le had been a woman, Mary Magdalen e, his consort.

But Christ loved her more than all the disciples, and used to kiss her often on her mouth. The rest of the disciples were offended... They said to him, \"Why do you love her more than all of us? the Savi or answered and said to them, \" Why d o I not love y ou as I love her?\" 19 The most mysterious and sacred of all Gnostic rituals may have played upon this perception of God as \"duality seeking unity. \" The Gosp el of Philip (which in its entirety might be read as a commentary on Gnosti c ritual) relates that the Lord established five great sacraments or mysteries: \"a baptism and a chrism, and a euchar ist, and a redemption, and a bridal cham ber.\" 20 Whet her this ultimate sacrament of the bridal chamber was a ritual enacted by a man and women, an allegor ical term for a mystical experience, or a union of both, we do not know. Only hints are given in Gnosti c texts about what this sacrament might be: Christ came to rectify the separation... and join the two comp onents; and to give life unto those who had died by separation and join them together. Now a woman joins with her husb and in the bridal [chamber], and those who have joined in the bridal [chamber] will not resep arate. 21 We are left with our poetic imaginations to consider what this might mean. Orthodox polemi cists frequently accused Gnostics of unorthodox sexual behavior. But exactly how these ideas and images played out in human affairs remains histor ically uncerta in. Classical Christian Gnostic ism vanished from the Western world during the fourth and fifth centur ies. But the Gnosti c world view -- with its affirmation of individual revelation granting certain knowledge; comprehe nsion of humank ind's true uncreated nature and inherent affinity or even identity with God; and its perception of duality, or even in an extreme statement, of masculine and femin ine elements seeking union within the divine--was not so easily extinguished. Such perception s continued in various forms to course throug h Western culture, though, perforce, often in very occult ways. Gnosticism was, and remains today, a living traditio n, a tradition eternally reborn in the gnosis kardia of humank ind. -- Lance S.

For the Father of the Son has no need of you.\" \"Hearken to the word, understand knowledge, love life, and no one will persecute you, nor will anyon e oppress you, other than you yourselves.\" \"O you wretc hes; O you unfortu nates; O you pretenders to the truth; O you falsifiers of know ledge; O you sinners against the Spirit: can you still bear to listen, when it behooved you to speak from the first? Can you still bear to sleep, when it behooved you to be awake from the first, so that the kingdom of heave n might receive you? Verily, I say unto you, had I been sent to those who listen to me, and had I spoken with them, I would never have come down to earth. So, then, be ashamed for these things.\" \"Behold, I shall depar t from you and go away, and do not wish to remain with you a ny longer, just as your yourselves have not wished it. Now, theref ore, follow me quickly. This is why I say unto you, 'For your sakes I came down.' You are the beloved; you are they who will be the cause of life in many. Invoke the Father, implore God often, and he will give to you. Blessed is he who has seen you with Him when He was proclaimed among the angels, and glorified among the saints; yours is life. Rejoice, and be glad, as sons of God. Keep his will, that you may be saved; accept reproof from me and save yourselv es. I intercede on your behalf with the Father, and he will forgive you much.\" And when we had heard these words, we became glad, for we had been grieved at the words we have mentioned before. But when he saw us rejoicing, he said, \"Woe to you who lack an advocate ! Woe to you who stand in need of grace! Blessed will they be who have spoken out and obtained grace for themselves. Liken yoursel ves to foreigners; of what sort are they in the eyes of your city? Why are you disturbed when you cast yourselv es away of your own accord and separate yoursel ves from your city? Why do you abandon your dwel ling place of your own accord, making it ready for those who want to dwell in it? O you outcasts and fugitives, woe to you, for you will be caught! Or do you perhaps think that the Father is a lover of mankind, or that he is won over without prayers, or that he grants remissio n to one on another's behalf, or that he bears with one who asks? - For he knows the desire, and also what it is that the flesh needs! - (Or do you think) that it is not this (flesh) that desires the soul? For without the soul, the body does not sin, just as the soul is not saved without the spirit. But if the soul is saved (when it is) without evil, and the spirit is also saved, then the body becomes free from sin. For it is the spirit that raises the soul, but the body that kills it; that is, it is it (the soul) which kills itself. Verily, I say unto you, he will not forgive the soul the sin by any means, nor the flesh the guilt; for none of those who have worn the flesh will be saved. For do you think that many have found the kingdom of heave n? Blessed is he who has seen himself as a fourth one in heaven!\" When we heard these words, we were distress ed. But when he saw that we were distressed, he said, \"For this cause I tell you this, that you may know yourselves. For the kingdom of heaven is like an ear of grain after it had sprouted in a field. And when it had ripened, it scattered its fruit and again filled the field with ears for another year. You also, hasten to reap an ear of life for yoursel ves, that you m ay be filled with the kingdom !\" \"And as long as I am with you, give heed to me, and obey me; but when I depart from you, rememb er me.

But give heed; blessed are they who have proclaimed the Son before his descent, that when I have come, I might ascend (again). Thrice blessed are they who were proclaimed by the Son before they came to be, that you might have a portion among them. \" Having said these words, he departed.

After this again, we wished to send our spirit upwar d to the Majesty, and after ascending, we were not permitted to see or hear anyth ing, for the other disciples called us and asked us, \"What did you hear from th e Master.

James writes to you. Peace be with you from Peace, love from Love, grace from Grace, faith from Faith, life from Holy Life! Since you asked me to send you a secret book which was revealed to me and Peter by the Lord, I could neither refuse you nor speak direct ly to you, but I have writte n it in Hebrew letters and have sent it to you - and to you alone. But inasmuch as you are a minister of the salvation of the saints, endeavor earnestly and take care not to recount this book to many - this which the Savior did not desire to recount to all of us, his twelve disciples. But blessed are those who will be saved through faith in this discourse. Now I sent you ten months ago another secret book with the Savior revealed to me. But that one you are to regar d in this manner, as revealed to me, James. Now the twelve disciples were sitting all together at the same time, and, remembering what the Savior had said to each one of them, whether secretly or openly, they were setting it down in books. And I was writing what was in my book - lo, the Savior appeared, after he had depar ted from us while we gazed at him. And five hundred and fifty days after he arose from the dead, we said to him: \"Have you gone and depar ted from us?\" And Jesus said: \"No, but I shall go to the place from which I have come. If you desire to come with me, come.\" They all answe red and said: \"If you bid us, we'l l come.\" He said: \"Truly I say to you, no one ever will enter the Kingdom of Heaven if I bid him, but rather because you yourselv es are full. Let me have James and Peter, in order that I may fill them.\" And when he called these two, he took them aside, and comman ded the rest to busy themselves with that with which they had been busy. The Savior said; \"You have received mercy.... (7 lines missing) Do you not desire, then, to be filled? And is your heart drunk? Do you not desire, then, to be sober? Therefore, be asham ed! And now, waking or sleeping, remember that you have seen the Son of Man, and with him you have spoken, and to him you have listened. Woe to those who have seen the Son of Man! Blessed are those who have not seen the Man, and who have not consorted with him, and who have not spoken with him, and who have not listened to anything from him. Yours is life! Know, therefore, that he healed you when you were ill, in order that you might reign. Woe to those who have rested from their illness, because they will relapse again into illness! Blessed are those who have not been ill, and have know n rest before they became ill. Yours is the Kingdom of God! Therefore I say to you, become full and leave no place within you empty, sin ce the Coming One is able to mock you.\" Then Peter answered: \"Lord, three times you have said to us 'Become full', but we are full.\" The Lord answered and said: \"Therefore I say unto you, become full, in order that you may not be diminished. Those who are dimin ished, howe ver, will not be saved. For fullness is good and diminution is bad. Therefore, just as it is good for you to be diminished and, on the other hand, bad for you to be filled, so also the one who is full is diminished; and the one who is diminished is not filled as the one who is diminished is filled, and the one who is full, for his part, brings his sufficiency to completion. Therefore, it is fitting to be diminished while you can still be filled, and to be filled while it is still possibl e to be diminished, in order that you can fill yourselves the more.

But if you are oppressed by Satan and are persec uted and you do the Father's will, I say that he will love you and will make you equal with me and will consider that you have become beloved through his provide nce according to your free choice.

Do you dare to spare the flesh, you for whom the spirit is an encircling wall? If you contemplate the world, how long it is before you and also how long it is after you, you will find that your life is one single day and your sufferings, one single hour.

I first spoke with you in parable s, and you did not understand. Now, in turn, I speak with you openly, and you do not perceive. But it is you who were to me a parable in parables and what is apparent in what are open. \"Be zealous to be saved without being urged. Rather, be ready on your own and, if possible, go before me. For thus the Father will love you. \"Become haters of hypocrisy and evil thought. For it is thoug ht which gives birth to hypocrisy, but hypocr isy is far from the truth. \"Let not the Kingdom of Heaven wither away. For it is like a date palm shoot whose fruits poured down around it. It put forth leaves and, when they budded, they caused the producti vity of the date palm to dry up.

For the Word's first condition is faith; the second is love; the third is works. Now from these comes life. For the Word is like a grain of wheat.

Do not go astray. And many times I have said to you all together - and also to you alone, James, I have said - 'Be saved!' And I have commanded you to follow me, and I have taugh t you the response in the presence of the rulers. Observe that I have descended, and I have spoken, and I have troubled myself, and I have received my crown, when I saved you. For I have descended to dwell with you in order that you also may dwell with me. And when I found that your houses had no ceilings over them, I dwelt in houses which would be able to receive me when I descended. \"Therefor e, obey me, my brothers.

For he knows the desire and also that which the flesh needs. Because it is not the flesh which yearns for the soul. For without the soul the body does not sin, just as the soul is not saved without the Spirit. But if the soul is saved when it is without evil, and if the spirit also is saved, then the body becomes sinless. For it is the spirit which anima tes the soul, but it is the body which kills it - that is, it is the soul which kills itself. Truly I say to you, the Father will not forgive the sin of the soul at all, nor the guilt of the flesh. For none of those who have worn the flesh will be saved.

Grant From Robert M. Grant, Gnosticism (Harper & Brothers , New York , 1961), as quoted in Willis Barns tone, The Other Bible (Harp er & Row, San Franc isco, 1984). The gospel of truth is joy to those who have received from the Father of truth the gift of know ing him by the pow er of the Logos, who has come from the Pleroma and who is in the thought and the mind of the Father; he it is who is called \"the Savior,\" since that is the name of the work which he must do for the redemption of those who have not known the Father. For the name of the gospel is the manifestation of hope, since that is the discovery of those who seek him, because the All sought him from whom it had come forth. You see, the All had been inside of him, that illimitable, inconceivable one, who is better than every thought. This ignora nce of the Father brought about terror and fear. And terror became dense like a fog, that no one was able to see. Because of this, error became strong. But it worked on its hylic substance vainly, because it did not know the truth. It was in a fashioned form while it was preparing, in power and in beauty , the equivalent of truth. This then, was not a humiliation for him, that illimitable, inconceivable one. For they were as nothing, this terror and this forgetful ness and this figure of falsehood, whereas this established truth is unchanging, unperturbe d and completely beautiful. For this reason, do not take error too seriousl y. Thus, since it had no root, it was in a fog as regards the Father, engaged in preparing works and forgetful nesses and fears in order, by these means, to begui le those of the middle and to make them captiv e. The forgetfulness of error was not revealed. It did not become light beside the Father. Forgetful ness did not exist with the Father, although it existed because of him. What exists in him is knowled ge, which was reveale d so that forgetfulness might be destroy ed and that they might know the Father, Since forgetful ness existed because they did not know the Father, if they then come to know the Father, from that moment on forgetfulness will cease to exist. That is the gospel of him whom they seek, which he has revealed to the perfect through the mercies of the Father as the hidde n mystery, Jesus the Christ. Throug h him he enlightened those who were in darkness because of forgetfulness. He enlightened them and gave them a path. And that path is the truth which he taugh t them. For this reason error was angry with him, so it persecuted him. It was distressed by him, so it made him powerless. He was nailed to a cross. He became a fruit of the know ledge of the Father. He did not, howe ver, destroy them because they ate of it. He rather caused those who ate of it to be joyfu l because of this discovery. And as for him, them he found in himself, and him they found in themselves, that illimitable, inconceivable one, that perfect Father who made the all, in whom the All is, and whom the All lacks, since he retained in himself their perfectio n, which he had not given to the all. The Father was not jealous. What jealousy, indeed, is there between him and his members? For, even if the Aeon had received their perfection, they would not have been able to approa ch the perfection of the Father, because he retained their perfection in himse lf, giving it to them as a way to return to him and as a know ledge unique in perfection. He is the one who set the All in order and in whom the All existed and whom the All lacked. As one of whom some have no knowledge, he desires that they know him and that they love him. For what is it that the All lacked, if not the knowledge of the Father? He became a guide, quiet and in leisure. In the middle of a school he came and spoke the Word, as a teacher. Those who were wise in their own estimatio n came to put him to the test. But he discredited them as empty-headed people. They hated him because they reall y were not w ise men. After all these came also the little children, those who possess the know ledge of the Father. When they became strong they were taugh t the aspects of the Father's face. They came to know and they - 2 4 -"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"were known. They were glorified and they gave glory. In their heart, the living book of the Living was manifest, the book which was writte n in the thoug ht and in the mind of the Father and, from before the foundation of the All, is in that incomprehensible part of him. This is the book which no one found possible to take, since it was reserved for him who will take it and be slain. No one was able to be manifest from those who believed in salvatio n as long as that book had not appeared. For this reason, the compassionate, faithful Jesus was patient in his sufferings until he took that book, since he knew that his death meant life for many. Just as in the case of a will which has not yet been opened, for the fortune of the deceased master of the house is hidden , so also in the case of the All which had been hidden as long as the Father of the All was invisible and unique in himsel f, in whom every space has its source. For this reason Jesus appeared. He took that book as his own. He was nailed to a cross. He affixed the edict of the Father to the cross. Oh, such great teaching! He abases himse lf even unto death, though he is clothed in eternal life. Having divested himse lf of these perishable rags, he clothed himself in incorruptibility, which no one could possib ly take from him. Having entered into the empty territory of fears, he passed before those who were stripped by forgetfulness, being both knowledge and perfection, proclaiming the things that are in the heart of the Father, so that he became the wisdom of those who have received instruction. But those who are to be taught, the living who are inscribed in the book of the living, learn for themselves, receiv ing instruct ions from the Father, turning to him again. Since the perfectio n of the All is in the Father, it is necessary for the All to ascend to him. Theref ore, if one has know ledge, he gets what belongs to him and draws it to himself. For he who is ignorant, is deficient, and it is a great deficiency, since he lacks that which will make him perfect. Since the perfection of the All is in the Father, it is necessary for the All to ascend to him and for each one to get the things which are his. He registered them first, havin g prepared them to be given to those who came from him. Those whose name he knew first were called last, so that the one who has know ledge is he whose name the Father has pronounc ed. For he whose name has not been spoken is ignorant. Indeed, how shall one hear if his name has not been uttered? For he who remains ignorant until the end is a creature of forgetfulness and will perish with it. If this is not so, why have these wretc hes no name, why do they have no sound? Hence, if one has knowledge, he is from above. If he is called, he hears, he replies, and he turns towar d him who called him and he ascends to him and he knows what he is called. Since he has know ledge, he does the will of him who called him. He desires to please him and he finds rest. He receives a certain name. He who thus is going to have know ledge knows whence he came and whither he is going . He knows it as a person who, having become intoxicated, has turned from his drunken ness and having come to himself, has restored what is his own. He has turned many from error. He went before them to their own places, from which they departed when they erred because of the depth of him who surrounds every place, whereas there is nothing which surround s him. It was a great wonder that they were in the Father without know ing him and that they were able to leave on their own, since they were not able to contain him and know him in whom they were, for indeed his will had not come forth from him. For he revealed it as a knowledge with which all its emanations agree, namely, the knowledge of the living book which he reveale d to the Aeons at last as his letters, displayi ng to them that these are not merely vowels nor consonants, so that one may read them and think of something void of meanin g; on the contrary, they are letters which convey the truth. They are pronoun ced only when they are known. Each letter is a perfect truth like a perfect book, for they are letters writte n by the hand of the unity, since the Father wrote them for the Aeons, so that they by means of his letters might come to kn ow the Father. While his wisdom mediates on the logos, and since his teaching expresses it, his knowledge has been revealed. His honor is a crown upon it. Since his joy agrees with it, his glory exalte d it. It has revealed his image. It has obtained his rest. His love took bodily form around it. His trust - 2 5 -"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"embraced it. Thus the logos of the Father goes forth into the All, being the fruit of his heart and expression of his will. It suppor ts the All. It chooses and also takes the form of the All, purify ing it, and causing it to return to the Father and to the Mother, Jesus of the utmost sweetness. The Father opens his bosom, but his bosom is the Holy Spirit. He reveals his hidde n self which is his son, so that through the compassion of the Father the Aeons may know him, end their wearying search for the Father and rest themsel ves in him, knowing that this is rest. After he had filled what was incomp lete, he did away with form. The form of it is the world, that which it served. For where there is envy and strife, there is an incompleteness; but where there is unity, there is completeness. Since this incom pleteness came about because they did not know the Father, so when they know the Father, incompleteness, from that moment on, will cease to exist. As one's ignorance disappears when he gains knowledge, and as darkness disappears when light appea rs, so also incomp leteness is eliminated by comple teness. Certainl y, from that moment on, form is no longer manifest, but will be dissolved in fusion with unity. For now their works lie scattered. In time unity will make the spaces complete. By mean s of unity each one will understand itself. By means of knowledge it will purify itself of diversit y with a view towards unity, devouring matter within itself like fire and da rkness by light, death by life. Certainly, if these things have happened to each one of us, it is fitting for us, surely, to think about the All so that the house may be holy and silent for unity. Like people who have moved from a neighborhood, if they have some dishes around which are not good, they usuall y break them. Nevertheless the householder does not suffer a loss, but rejoices, for in the place of these defective dishes there are those which are completely perfect. For this is the judgement which has come from above and which has judged every person, a drawn two-edged sword cutting on this side and that. When it appeared, I mean, the Logos, who is in the heart of those who pronounce it - it was not merely a sound but it has become a body - a great disturban ce occur red among the dishes, for some were emptied, others filled: some were provided for, others were remove d; some were purifi ed, still others were broken. All the spaces were shaken and disturbed for they had no composure nor stability. Error was disturbed not knowi ng what it should do. It was troubled; it lamented, it was beside itself because it did not know anything. When knowledge, which is its abolishment, approached it with all its emanations, error is empty , since there is nothing in it. Truth appeared; all its emanations recogn ized it. They actual ly greeted the Father with a power which is complete and which joins them with the Father. For each one loves truth because truth is the mouth of the Father. His tongue is the Holy Spirit, who joins him to truth attaching him to the mouth of the Father by his tongue at the time he shall receive the Holy Spirit. This is the manifestation of the Father and his revelation to his Aeons. He revealed his hidden self and explain ed it. For who is it who exists if it is not the Father himsel f? All the spaces are his emanatio ns. They knew that they stem from him as children from a perfect man. They knew that they had not yet received form nor had they yet received a name, every one of which the Father produce s. If they at that time receive form of his knowledge, though they are truly in him, they do not know him. But the Father is perfect. He knows every space which is within him. If he pleases, he reveals anyone whom he desires by giving him a form and by giving him a name; and he does give him a name and cause him to come into being. Those who do not yet exist are ign orant of him who created them. I do not say, then, that those who do not yet exist are nothing. But they are in him who will desire that they exist when he pleases, like the event which is going to happen. On the one hand, he knows, before anything is revealed, what he will produce . On the other hand , the fruit which has not yet been revealed does not know anything, nor is it anything either. Thus each space which, on its part, is in the Father comes from the existent one, who, on his part, has established it from the nonexisten t. [...] he who does not exist at all, will never exist. What, then, is that which he wants him to think? \"I am like the shadows and phantoms of the night.\" When morni ng comes, this one knows that the fear which he had experienced was nothing. Thus they were ignorant of the Father; he is the one whom they did not see. Since there had been fear and confusion and a lack of confidence and doubl emindness and division, there were many illusions which were conceived by him, the foregoi ng, as well as empty ignora nce - as if they were fast asleep and found themse lves a prey to trouble d dreams. Either there is a place to which they - 2 6 -"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"flee, or they lack strength as they come, having pursue d unspe cified things. Either they are involved in inflicting blows, or they themse lves receive bruises. Either they are falling from high places, or they fly off through the air, though they have no wings at all. Other times, it is as if certain people were trying to kill them, even though there is no one pursuing them; or, they themse lves are killing those beside them, for they are stained by their blood. Until the moment when they who are passing through all these things - I mean they who have experienced all these confusions - awake, they see nothing because the dream s were nothing. It is thus that they who cast ignorance from them as sheep do not consider it to be anything, nor regard its propertie s to be something real, but they renoun ce them like a dream in the night and they consider the know ledge of the Father to be the dawn. It is thus that each one has acted, as if he were asleep, during the time when he was ignorant and thus he comes to understand, as if he were awakening. And happy is the man who comes to himself and awakens. Indeed, blessed is he who has opened the eyes of the blind. And the Spirit came to him in haste when it raised him. Having given its hand to the one lying prone on the ground, it placed him firmly on his feet, for he had not yet stood up. He gave them the means of knowin g the knowledge of the Father and the revelat ion of his son. For when they saw it and listened to it, he permitted them to take a taste of and to smell and to grasp the beloved son. He appeared, inform ing them of the Father, the illimitable one. He inspired them with that which is in the mind, while doing his will. Many received the light and turned towards him. But material men were alien to him and did not discern his appeara nce nor recognize him. For he came in the likeness of flesh and nothing blocked his way because it was incorruptible and unrestrainable. Moreover, while saying new things, speaking about what is in the heart of the Father, he proclaimed the faultless word. Light spoke throug h his mouth, and his voice brought forth life. He gave them thoug ht and understandi ng and mercy and salvat ion and the Spirit of strength derived from the limitlessness of the Father and sweetness. He caused punishme nts and scourgin gs to cease, for it was they which caused many in need of mercy to astray from him in error and in chains - and he mightily destroyed them and derided them with knowled ge. He became a path for those who went astray and knowledge to those who were ignora nt, a discovery for those who sought, and a support for those who tremble, a purity for those who were defiled. He is the shepherd who left behind the ninety-nine sheep which had not strayed and went in search of that one which was lost. He rejoiced when he had found it. For ninety-nine is a numbe r of the left hand, which holds it. The moment he finds the one, however, the whole numbe r is transfe rred to the right hand. Thus it is with him who lacks the one, that is, the entire right hand which attracts that in which it is deficient, seizes it from the left side and transfers it to the right. In this way, then, the number becomes one hundred. This numbe r signifies the Father. He labored even on the Sabbath for the sheep which he found fallen into the pit. He saved the life of that sheep, bringing it up from the pit in order that you may understand fully what that Sabbath is, you who possess full understanding. It is a day in which it is not fitting that salvation be idle, so that you may speak of that heavenly day which has no night and of the sun which does not set because it is perfect. Say then in your heart that you are this perfect day and that in you the light which does n ot fail dwel ls. Speak concerning the truth to those who seek it and of knowled ge to those who, in their error, have committed sin. Make sure-footed those who stum ble and stretch forth your hands to the sick. Nourish the hungry and set at ease those who are troubled. Foster men who love. Raise up and awaken those who sleep. For you are this understandi ng which encourages. If the strong follow this course, they are even stronger. Turn your attention to yourselves. Do not be concerned with other things, namely, that which you have cast forth from yourse lves, that which you have dismissed. Do not return to them to eat them. Do not be moth-eaten. Do not be worm -eaten, for you have already shaken it off. Do not be a place of the devil, for you have already destroyed him. Do not strengthe n your last obstacles, because that is reprehensible. For the lawless one is nothing. He harms himse lf more than the law. For that one does his works because he is a lawless person. - 2 7 -"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"But this one, because he is a righteous person, does his works among others. Do the will of the Father, then, for you are from him. For the Father is sweet and his will is good. He knows the things that are yours, so that you may rest yourselves in them. For by the fruits one knows the things that are yours, that they are the children of the Father, and one knows his aroma, that you originate from the grace of his countenance. For this reason, the Father loved his aroma; and it manifests itself in every place; and when it is mixed with matter, he gives his aroma to the light; and into his rest he causes it to ascend in every form and in every sound. For there are no nostri ls which smell the aroma, but it is the Spirit which possesses the sense of smell and it draws it for itself to itself and sinks into the aroma of the Father. He is, indeed, the place for it, and he takes it to the place from which it has come, in the first aroma which is cold. It is somethi ng in a psychic form, resemb ling cold water which is [...] since it is in soil which is not hard, of which those who see it think, \"It is earth.\" Afterwards, it becomes soft again. If a breath is taken, it is usually hot. The cold aromas, then, are from the division. For this reason, God came and destroyed the division and he brought the hot Pleroma of love, so that the cold may not return , but the unity of the Perfe ct Thought prevai l. This is the word of the Gospel of the finding of the Pleroma for those who wait for the salvat ion which comes from above. When their hope, for which they are waiting, is waiting - they whose likeness is the light in which there is no shadow, then at that time the Pleroma is about to come. The deficiency of matter, however, is not because of the limitlessness of the Father who comes at the time of the deficiency. And yet no one is able to say that the incorrupti ble One will come in this manner. But the depth of the Father is increasing, and the though t of error is not with him. It is a matter of falling down and a matter of being readily set upright at the finding of that one who has come to him who will turn back. For this turning back is called \"repentanc e\". For this reason, incorrupt ion has breathed. It followed him who has sinned in order that he may find rest. For forgiveness is that which remains for the light in the deficiency, the word of the pleroma. For the physician hurries to the place in which there is sickness, because that is the desire which he has. The sick man is in a deficient condit ion, but he does not hide himself because the physician possesses that which he lacks. In this manner the deficiency is filled by the Pleroma, which has no deficiency, which has given itself out in order to fill the one who is deficient, so that grace may take him, then, from the area which is deficient and has no grace. Because of this a diminishing occurred in the place which there is no grace, the area w here the one who is small, who is deficient, is taken hold of. He revealed himse lf as a Pleroma, i.e., the finding of the light of truth which has shined towards him, because he is unchangeable. For this reason, they who have been troubled speak about Christ in their midst so that they may receive a return and he may anoin t them with the ointment. The ointment is the pity of the Father, who will have mercy on them. But those whom he has anoint ed are those who are perfect. For the filled vessels are those which are customa rily used for anoint ing. But when an anoint ing is finished, the vessel is usually empty, and the cause of its deficiency is the consumption of its ointment. For then a breath is drawn only through the power which he has. But the one who is without deficiency - one does not trust anyone beside him nor does one pour anyth ing out. But that which is the deficient is filled again by the perfect Father. He is good. He knows his plantings because he is the one who has planted them in his Paradise. And his Paradise is his place of rest. This is the perfect ion in the thought of the Father and these are the words of his reflection. Each one of his words is the work of his will alone, in the revelat ion of his Logos. Since they were in the depth of his mind, the Logos, who was the first to come forth, caused them to appear, along with an intellect which speaks the unique word by means of a silent grace. It was called \"thought,\" since they were in it before becomi ng manifest. It happened, then, that it was the first to come forth - at the moment pleasing to the will of him who desired it; and it is in the will that the Father is at rest and with which he is pleased. Nothi ng happens without him, nor does anything occur without the will of the Father. But his will is incompre hensible. His will is his mark, but no one can know it, nor is it possible for them to con centrate on it in order to possess it. But that which he wishes takes place at the mom ent he wishes it - even if the view does not please anyone: it is God`s will.

The end, you see, is the recognition of him who is hidden, that is, the Father, from whom the beginning came forth and to whom will return all who have come from him. For they were made manifest for the glory and the joy of his name. And the name of the Father is the Son. It is he who, in the beginning, gave a name to him who came forth from him - he is the same one - and he begat him for a son. He gave him his name which belonged to him - he, the Father, who possesses everything which exists around him. He possess the name; he has the son. It is possib le for them to see him. The name, howe ver, is invisible, for it alone is the mystery of the invisible about to come to ears completel y filled with it through the Father`s agency. Moreover, as for the Father, his name is not pronounced, but it is revealed through a son. Thus, then, the name is great. Who, then, has been able to pronounce a name for him, this great name, except him alone to whom the name belongs and the sons of the name in whom the name of the Father is at rest, and who themselves in turn are at rest in his name, since the Father has no beginning? It is he alone who engendered it for himse lf as a name in the beginning before he had created the Aeons, that the name of the Father should be over their heads as a lord - that is, the real name, which is secure by his authority and by his perfect powe r. For the name is not drawn from lexicons nor is his name derived from common name- giving, But it is invisible. He gave a name to himself alone, because he alone saw it and because he alone was capable of giving himsel f a name. For he who does not exist has no name. For what name would one give him who did not exist? Neverthel ess, he who exists also with his name and he alone knows it, and to him alone the Father gave a name. The Son is his name. He did not, theref ore, keep it secretly hidden, but the son came into existence. He himsel f gave a name to him. The name, then, is that of the Father, just as the name of the Father is the Son. For otherwise, where would compassion find a name - outside of the Father? But someone will probab ly say to his companion, \"Who would give a name to someone who existed before himsel f, as if, indeed, children did not receive their name from one of those who gave them birth?\" Above all, then, it is fitting for us to think this point over: What is the name? It is the real name. It is, indeed, the name which came from the Father, for it is he who owns the name. He did not, you see, get the name on loan, as in the case of others because of the form in which each one of them is going to be created. This, then, is the authoritati ve name. There is no one else to whom he has given it. But it remained unnamed, unuttered, `till the moment when he, who is perfect, pronoun ced it himsel f; and it was he alone who was able to pronounce his name and to see it. When it pleased him, then, that his son should be his pronoun ced name and when he gave this name to him, he who has come from the depth spoke of his secrets, because he knew that the Father was absolute goodness. For this reason, indeed, he sent this particu lar one in order that he might speak concerning the place and his place of rest from which he had come forth, and that he might glorify the Pleroma, the greatness of his name and the sweetness of his Father. Each one will speak concer ning the place from which he has come forth, and to the region from which he received his essential being, he will hasten to return once again. And he want from that place - the place where he was - because he tasted of that place, as he was nourished and grew. And his own place of rest is his Pleroma . All the eman ations from the Father, therefore, are Pleroma s, and all his emanations have their roots in the one who caused them all to grow from himse lf. He appointed a limit. They, then, became manifest individually in order that they might be in their own thought, for that place to which they extend their though ts is their root, which lifts them upward through all height s to the Father. They reach his head, which is rest for them, and they remain there near to it so that they say that they have partic ipated in his face by means of embraces. But these of this kind were not manifest, because they have not risen above themselves. Neither have they been deprived of the glory of the Father nor have they thought of him as small, nor bitter, nor angry, but as absolute ly good, unperturbed, sweet, knowi ng all the spaces before they came into existen ce and having no need of instruction.

They lack nothing in any way, but they are given rest and are refreshed by the Spirit.

MacR ae Selection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library , revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francis co, 1990. The gospel of truth is joy for those who have received from the Father of truth the grace of know ing him, through the power of the Word that came forth from the pleroma, the one who is in the thought and the mind of the Father, that is, the one who is addressed as 'the Savior', (that) being the name of the work he is to perform for the redemption of those who were ignorant of the Father, while in the name of the gospel is the proclam ation of hope, being discov ery for those who search for him. When the totality went about searching for the one from whom they had come forth - and the totality was inside of him, the incompre hensible, inconceivable one who is superior to every thought - ignora nce of the Father brought about anguis h and terror; and the anguish grew solid like a fog, so that no one was able to see. For this reason, error became powerfu l; it worked on its own matter foolis hly, not having known the truth. It set about with a creation, preparin g with power and beauty the substitute for the truth. This was not, then, a humiliation for him, the incompre hensible, incon ceivable one, for they were nothing, the anguish and the oblivion and the creature of deceit, while the established truth is immutabl e, imperturba ble, perfect in beauty. For this reason, despi se error. Thus, it had no root; it fell into a fog regarding the Father, while it was involved in preparing works and oblivions and terrors, in order that by mean s of these it might entice those of the middle and capture them. The oblivion of error was not revealed. It is not a [...] from the Father. Oblivion did not come into existence from the Father, although it did indeed come into existe nce because of him. But what comes into existen ce in him is know ledge, which appea red in order that oblivion might vanish and the Father might be known. Since oblivion came into existence because the Father was not known , then if the Father comes to be know n, oblivion will not exist from that moment on. Throug h this, the gospel of the one who is searched for, which <was> revealed to those who are perfect, throug h the mercies of the Father, the hidden mystery, Jesus, the Christ, enlightened those who were in darkness through oblivion. He enlightened them; he showed (them) a way; and the way is the truth which he taught them. For this reason, error grew angry at him, persecuted him, was distressed at him, (and) was brought to naught. He was nailed to a tree (and) he became fruit of the knowledge of the Father. It did not, however, cause destructio n because it was eaten, but to those who ate it, it gave (cause) to become glad in the discovery, and he discovered them in himse lf, and they discovered him in themse lves. As for the incompre hensible, inconceivable one, the Father, the perfect one, the one who made the totality, within him is the totality, and of him the totality has need. Although he retained their perfection within himse lf, which he did not give to the totality, the Father was not jealous . What jealousy indeed (could there be) between himsel f and his members? For if this aeon had thus received their perfecti on, they could not have come [...] the Father. He retains within himse lf their perfection, granting it to them as a return to him, and a perfect ly unitary knowledge. It is he who fashioned the totali ty, and within him is the totality, and the totality was in need of him. As in the case of a person of whom some are ignorant, he wishes to have them know him and love him, so - for what did the totality have need of if not know ledge regard ing the Father? - he became a guide, restful and leisurel y. In schools he appeared, (and) he spoke the word as a teacher. There came the men wise in their own estimation, putting him to the test. But he confounded them, because they were foolish. They hated him, because they were not really wise. - 3 1 -"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"After all these, there came the little children also, those to whom the knowledge of the Father belon gs. Having been streng thened, they learned about the impressi ons of the Father. They knew, they were know n; they were glorified, they glorified. There was manifested in their heart the living book of the living - the one written in the thought and the mind of the Father, which from before the foundation of the totali ty was within his incompre hensibility - that (book) which no one was able to take, since it remains for the one who will take it to be slain. No one could have become manifest from among those who have believed in salvatio n unless that book had appeared. For this reason, the merciful one, the faithful one, Jesus, was patient in acceptin g sufferings until he took that book, since he knows that his death is life for many . Just as there lies hidden in a will, before it is opened, the fortune of the deceased master of the house , so (it is) with the totality, which lay hidden while the Father of the totality was invisible, being somethi ng which is from him, from whom every space comes forth. For this reason Jesus appeared; he put on that book; he was nailed to a tree; he published the edict of the Father on the cross. O such great teaching! He draws himself down to death, though life eternal clothes him. Having stripped himse lf of the perisha ble rags, he put on imperishability, which no one can possibly take away from him. Having entered the empty spaces of terrors, he passed through those who were strippe d naked by oblivion, being knowledge and perfect ion, proclaiming the things that are in the heart, [...] teach those who will receive teaching. But those who are to receive teaching are the living, who are inscribed in the book of the living. It is about themsel ves that they receive instru ction, receiving it from the Father, turning again to him. Since the perfection of the totality is in the Father, it is necessary for the totality to ascend to him. Then, if one has know ledge, he receives what are his own, and draws them to himse lf. For he who is ignorant is in need, and what he lacks is great, since he lacks that which will make him perfect. Since the perfect ion of the totality is in the Father, and it is necessary for the totality to ascend to him, and for each one to receive what are his own, he enrolled them in advance, having prepared them to give to those who came forth from him. Those whose name he knew in advance were called at the end, so that one who has knowledge is the one whose name the Father has uttered. For he whose name has not been spoken is ignora nt. Indeed, how is one to hear, if his name has not been called? For he who is ignorant until the end is a creature of oblivion, and he will vanish along with it. If not, how is it that these miserab le ones have no name, (that) they do not have the call? Theref ore, if one has knowledge, his is from above. If he is called , he hears, he answers, and he turns to him who is calling him, and ascends to him. And he knows in what manner he is called. Having knowledge, he does the will of the one who called him, he wishes to be pleasi ng to him, he receives rest. Each one's name comes to him. He who is to have know ledge in this manner knows where he comes from and where he is going. He knows as one who, having become drunk, has turned away from his drunk enness, (and) having returned to himse lf, has set right what are his own. He has brought many back from error. He has gone before them to their places, from which they had moved away, since it was on account of the depth that they receiv ed error, the depth of the one who encircles all spaces, while there is none that encircles him. It was a great wonder that they were in the Father, not know ing him, and (that) they were able to come forth by themse lves, since they were unable to comprehend or to know the one in whom they were. For if his will had not thus emerged from him - for he revealed it in view of a knowledge in which all its emanations concur. This is the knowl edge of the living book, which he revealed to the aeons at the end as his letters, revealing how they are not vowels nor are they consonants, so that one might read them and thi nk of somethi ng foolish, but (rather that) they are letters of the truth, which they alone speak who know them. Each letter is a complete <thought> , like a complete book, since they are letters written by the Unity, the Father having writte n them for the aeons, in order that by means of his letters they should know the Father. While his wisdom contempl ates the Word, and his teaching utters it, his knowledge has revealed <it>.

In this way, the Word of the Father goes forth in the totality, as the fruit of his heart and an impress ion of his will. But it supports the totality, purifying them, bringing them back into the Father, into the Mother, Jesus of the infinite sweetness. The Father reveals his bosom. - Now his bosom is the Holy Spirit. - He reveals what is hidden of him - what is hidde n of him is his Son - so that through the mercies of the Father, the aeons may know him and cease laboring in search of the Father, resting there in him, knowing that this is the (final) rest. Having filled the deficiency, he abolished the form - the form of it is the world, that in which he served. - For the place where there is envy and strife is deficient, but the place where (there is) Unity is perfect. Since the deficiency came into being because the Father was not known, therefor e, when the Father is know n, from that moment on, the deficiency will no longer exist. As in the case of the ignoran ce of a person, when he comes to have knowl edge, his ignorance vanishes of itself, as the darkness vanishes when the light appears, so also the deficiency vanishes in the perfection. So from that moment on, the form is not apparent, but it will vanish in the fusion of Unity, for now their works lie scattered. In time, Unity will perfect the spaces. It is within Unity that each one will attain himse lf; within know ledge, he will purify himse lf from multip licity into Unity, consuming matter w ithin himself like fire, and darkness by light, death by life. If indeed these things have happened to each one of us, then we must see to it above all that the house will be holy and silent for the Unity - as in the case of some people who moved out of dwellings having jars that in spots were not good. They would break them, and the master of the house would not suffer loss. Rather, <he> is glad, because in place of the bad jars (there are) full ones which are made perfect. For such is the judgment which has come from above. It has passe d judgment on everyone; it is a drawn sword, with two edges, cutting on either side. When the Word appeared, the one that is within the heart of those who utter it - it is not a sound alone, but it became a body - a great disturbance took place among the jars, because some had been emptied, others filled; that is, some had been supplied, others poured out, some had been purified, still others broken up. All the spaces were shaken and disturbed, because they had no order nor stability. Error was upset, not knowing what to do; it was grieved, in mourning, afflicting itself because it knew nothing. When knowledge drew near it - this is the downfall of (error) and all its emanatio ns - error is empty, having nothi ng inside. Truth appeared; all its emanations knew it. They greeted the Father in truth with a perfect power that joins them with the Father. For, as for everyone who loves the truth - because the truth is the mouth of the Father; his tongue is the Holy Spirit - he who is joined to the truth is joined to the Father's mouth by his tongue, whenever he is to receive the Holy Spirit, since this is the manifestation of the Father, and his revelat ion to his aeons. He manifested what was hidden of him; he explain ed it. For who contains, if not the Father alone? All the spaces are his emanations. They have known that they came forth from him, like children who are from a grown man. They knew that they had not yet received form, nor yet received a name, each one of which the Father begets. Then, when they receive form by his knowledge, though truly within him, they do not know him. But the Father is perfect, knowi ng every space within him. If he wishes, he manifests whomever he wishes, by giving him form and giving him a name, and he gives a name to him, and brings it about that those come into existence who, before they come into existence, are ignora nt of him who fashioned them. I do not say, then, that they are nothing (at all) who have not yet come into existen ce, but they are in him who will wish that they come into existe nce when he wishes, like the time that is to come. Before all things appear, he knows what he will produce. But the fruit which is not yet manif est does not know anything, nor does it do anyth ing. Thus also, every space which is itself in the Father is from the one who exists, who establ ished it from what does not exist. For he who has no root has no fruit either, but though he thinks to himse lf, \"I have come into being,\" yet he will perish by himse lf. For this reason, he who did not exist at all will never come into existen ce. What, then, did he wish him to think of himse lf? This: \"I have come into being like the shadows and phantom s of the night.\" When the light shines on the terror which that person had experien ced, he knows that it is nothi ng. - 3 3 -"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Thus, they were ignorant of the Father, he being the one whom they did not see. S ince it was terror and disturban ce and instability and doubt and division, there were many illusions at work by means of these, and (many) empty fictions, as if they were sunk in sleep, and found themselves in disturbing dreams. Either (there is) a place to which they are fleeing, or without strength they come (from) having chased after others, or they are involved in striking blows, or they are receiving blows themselves, or they have fallen from high places, or they take off into the air, though they do not even have wings. Again, sometimes (it is as) if peopl e were murdering them, though there is no one even pursuing them, or they themsel ves are killing their neighbors, for they have been stained with their blood. When those who are going through all these things wake up, they see nothing, they who were in the midst of all these disturba nces, for they are nothing. Such is the way of those who have cast ignorance aside from them like sleep, not esteeming it as anyth ing, nor do they esteem its works as solid things either, but (rather,) they leave them behind like a dream in the night. The knowledge of the Father, they value as the dawn. This is the way each one has acted, as though asleep at the time when he was ignorant. And this is the way he has <come to know ledge>, as if he had awakened. {and} Good for the man who will return and awaken. And blessed is he who has opened the eyes of the blind. And the Spirit ran after him, hastening from waking him up. Having extend ed his hand to him who lay upon the ground, he set him up on his feet, for he had not yet risen. He gave them the means of knowing the knowledge of the Father and the revelation of his Son. For when they had seen him and had heard him, he granted them to taste him, and to smell him, and to touch the beloved Son. When he had appear ed, instructing them about the Father, the incompre hensible one, when he had breathed into them what is in the thought, doing his will, when many had received the light, they turned to him. For the material ones were strangers, and did not see his likeness, and had not known him. For he came by mean s of fleshly form, while nothing blocked his course, because incorrupti bility is irresistible, since he, again, spoke new things, still speaking about what is in the heart of the Father, having brought forth the flawless Word. When light had spoken through his mouth, as well as his voice, which gave birth to life, he gave them thoug ht and understandi ng, and mercy and salvation, and the powerful spirit from the infiniteness and the sweetness of the Father. Having made punishment s and tortures cease - for it was they which were leading astray from his face some who were in need of mercy, in error and in bonds - he both destroyed them with powe r and confounded them with knowl edge. He became a way for those who were gone astray, and knowled ge for those who were ignorant, a discovery for those who were search ing, and a suppor t for those who were wavering, immaculateness for those who were defiled. He is the shepherd who left behind the ninety-nine sheep which were not lost. He went searching for the one which had gone astray. He rejoiced when he found it, for ninety-nine is a number that is in the left hand, which holds it. But when the one is found, the entire number passes to the right (hand). As that which lacks the one - that is, the entire right (hand) - draws what was deficient and takes it from the left-hand side and brings (it) to the right, so too the number becomes one hundr ed. It is the sign of the one who is in their sound; it is the Father. Even on the Sabbath, he labored for the sheep which he found fallen into the pit. He gave life to the sheep, having brought it up from the pit, in order that you might know interiorly - you, the sons of interior know ledge - what is the Sabbath, on which it is not fitting for salvation to be idle, in order that you may speak from the day from above, which has no night, and from the light which does not sink, because it is perfect. Say, then, from the heart, that you are the perfect day, and in you dwells the light that does not fail. Speak of the truth with those who search for it, and (of) knowledge to those who have committed sin in their error. Make firm the foot of those who have stumbled, and stretch out your hands to those who are ill. Feed those who are hungry, and give repose to those who are weary, and raise up those who wish to rise, and awaken those who sleep. For you are the understanding that is drawn forth.

Do not become a (dwelling) place for the devil, for you have already destroyed him. Do not strengthen (those who are) obstacle s to you, who are collaps ing, as thoug h (you were) a suppor t (for them). For the lawless one is someone to treat ill, rather than the just one. For the former does his work as a lawless person; the latter as a righteous person does his work among others. So you, do the will of the Father, for you are from him. For the Father is sweet, and in his will is what is good. He has taken cognizance of the things that are yours, that you might find rest in them. For by the fruits does one take cognizance of the things that are yours, because the children of the Father are his fragrance, for they are from the grace of his countenance. For this reason, the Father loves his fragrance, and manifests it in every place. And if it mixes with matter, he gives his fragran ce to the light, and in his repose, he causes it to surpass every form (and) every sound. For it is not the ears that smell the fragrance, but (it is) the breath that has the sense of smell and attracts the fragrance to itself, and is submerged in the fragrance of the Father, so that he thus shelters it, and takes it to the place where it came from, from the first fragran ce, which is grown cold. It is somethi ng in a psychic form, being like cold water which has frozen (?), which is on earth that is not solid, of which those who see it think it is earth; afterwards, it dissolves again. If a breath draws it, it gets hot. The fragran ces, theref ore, that are cold are from the division. For this reason, faith came; it dissolved the division, and it brought the warm pleroma of love, in order that the cold should not come again, but (that) there should be the unity of perfect thought. This <is> the word of the gospel of the discovery of the pleroma, for those who await the salvation which is coming from on high. While their hope, for which they are waitin g, is in waiting - they whose image is light with no shadow in it - then, at that time, the pleroma is proceed ing to come. The <deficiency> of matter came to be not through the limitlessness of the Father, who is coming to give time for the deficiency, althoug h no one could say that the incorruptible one would come in this way. But the depth of the Father was multiplied, and the thought of error did not exist with him. It is a thing that falls, (and) it is a thing that easily stands upright (again), in the discov ery of him who has come to him whom he shall bring back. For the bringing-back is called 'repenten ce'. For this reason, incorruptibility breathed forth; it pursued the one who had sinned, in order that he might rest. For forgiveness is what remains for the light in the deficiency, the word of the pleroma. For the physician runs to the place where sickness is, because that is the will that is in him. He who has a deficiency, then, does not hide it, because one has what the other lacks. So the pleroma, which has no deficiency, but (which) fills up the deficiency, is what he provided from himse lf for filling up what he lacks, in order that therefore he might receive the grace. For when he was deficient, he did not have the grace. That is why there was diminut ion existing in the place where there is no grace. When that which was diminished was received, he revealed what he lacked, being (now) a pleroma; that is the discovery of the light of truth which rose upon him because it is immutable. That is why Christ was spoken of in their midst, so that those who were disturbed might receive a bringing-back, and he might anoint them with the ointment . This ointment is the mercy of the Father, who will have mercy on them. But those whom he has anoin ted are the ones who have become perfect. For full jars are the ones that are usually anointed . But when the anointing of one (jar) is dissolved, it is emptied, and the reason for there being a deficiency is the thing by which its ointment goes. For at that time a breath draws it, a thing in the powe r of that which is with it. But from him who has no deficiency, no seal is removed, nor is anything emptied, but what he lacks, the perfect Father fills again. He is good. He knows his plantings, because it is he who planted them in his paradise. Now his paradise is his place of rest. This is the perfection in the thought of the Father, and these are the words of his meditation. Each one of his words is the work of his one will in the revelatio n of his Word. While they were still depths of his thought, the Word, which was first to come forth, revealed them, along with a mind that speaks the one Word in silent grace. He was called 'thought', since they were in it before being revealed. It came about, then, that he was first to come forth, at the time when the will of him who willed desired it. And the will is what the Father rests in, and is pleased with.

His trace is the will, and no one will know him, nor is it possib le for one to scrutinize him, in order to grasp him. But when he wills, what he wills is this - even if the sight does not please them in any way before God - desiring the Father. For he knows the beginning of all of them, and their end. For at their end, he will question them directly. Now, the end is receiving knowledge about the one who is hidden, and this is the Father, from whom the beginning came forth, (and) to whom all will return who have come forth from him. And they have appeared for the glory and the joy of his name. Now the name of the Father is the Son. It is he who first gave a name to the one who came forth from him, who was himse lf, and he begot him as a son. He gave him his name, which belonged to him; he is the one to whom belongs all that exists around him, the Father. His is the name; his is the Son. It is possible for him to be seen. The name, howev er, is invisible, because it alone is the mystery of the invisible, which comes to ears that are completely filled with it by him. For indeed, the Father's name is not spoken, but (rather, ) it is apparent through a Son. In this way, then, the name is a great thing. Who, therefore, will be able to utter a name for him, the great name, except him alone to whom the name belongs, and the sons of the name, in whom rested the name of the Father, (who) in turn themse lves rested in his name? Since the Father is unengen dered, he alone is the one who begot him for him(self) as a name, before he brought forth the aeons, in order that the name of the Father should be over their head as lord, that is the name in truth, which is firm in his command, through perfect power. For the name is not from (mere) words, nor does his name consist of appellations, but (rather,) it is invisible. He gave a name to him alone, since he alone sees him, he alone having the power to give him a name. For he who does not exist has no name. For what name is given to him who does not exist? But the one who exists, exists also with his name, and he alone knows it, and (he) alone (knows how) to give him a name. It is the Father. The Son is his name. He did not, therefore, hide it in the thing, but it existed; as for the Son, he alone gave a name. The name, therefore, is that of the Father, as the name of the Father is the Son. Where indeed would compassi on find a name, except with the Father? But no doubt one will say to his neigh bor: \"Who is it who will give a name to him who existed before himself, as if offspri ng did not receive a name from those who begot <them>?\" First, then, it is fitting for us to reflect on this matter: What is the name? It is the name in truth; it is not therefore the name from the Father, for it is the one which is the proper name. Therefore, he did not receiv e the name on loan, as (do) others, accord ing to the form in which each one is to be produced. But this is the proper name. There is no one else who gave it to him. But he <is> unnamable, indescribable, until the time when he who is perfect spoke of him alone. And it is he who has the power to speak his name, and to see it. When, therefore, it pleased him that his name, which is loved, should be his Son, and he gave the name to him, that is, him who came forth from the depth, he spoke about his secret things, know ing that the Father is a being without evil. For that very reason, he brought him forth in order to speak about the place, and (about ) his resting-place, from which he had come forth, and to glorify the pleroma, the greatness of his name, and the sweetness of the Father. About the place each one came from, he will speak, and to the region where he received his establ ishment, he will hasten to return again and to take from that place - the place where he stood - receiving a taste from that place, and receiving nourish ment, receiving growth. And his own resting-place is his pleroma. Theref ore, all the emanatio ns of the Father are pleromas, and the root of all his emanations is in the one who made them all grow up in himself. He assigned them their destin ies. Each one, then, is manifest, in order that through their own though t <...>. For the place to which they send their thought, that place, their root, is what takes them up in all the heights, to the Father. They possess his head, which is rest for them, and they are suppor ted, approach ing him, as though to say that they have participated in his face by mean s of kisses. But they do not becom e manifest in this way, for they are not themselves exalted; (yet) neither did they lack the glory of the Father, nor did they think of him as small, nor that he is harsh, nor that he is wrathful, but (rather that) he is a being - 3 6 -"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"without evil, imperturba ble, sweet, knowing all spaces before they have come into existen ce, and he had no need to be instructed.

But they themselves are the truth; and the Father is within them, and they are in the Father, being perfect, being undivided in the truly good one, being in no way deficient in anything, but they are set at rest, refreshed in the Spirit.

Peel Selection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library , revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francis co, 1990. Some there are, my son Rhegi nos, who want to learn many things. They have this goal when they are occupied with questions whose answer is lacking. If they succeed with these, they usually think very highly of themse lves. But I do not think that they have stood within the Word of Truth. They seek rather their own rest, which we have received through our Savior, our Lord Christ. We received it when we came to know the truth and rested ourselves upon it. But since you ask us pleasantly what is proper concerning the resurrectio n, I am writing you that it is necessary. To be sure, many are lacking faith in it, but there are a few who find it. So then, let us discuss the matter. How did the Lord proclaim things while he existed in flesh and after he had revealed himse lf as Son of God? He lived in this place where you remain, speaking about the Law of Nature - but I call it 'Death'. Now the Son of God, Rhegi nos, was Son of Man. He embraced them both, possessing the humanity and the divinity, so that on the one hand he might vanquish death through his being Son of God, and that on the other through the Son of Man the restoration to the Pleroma might occur; because he was originally from above , a seed of Truth, before this structure had come into being. In this many dominio ns and divinities came into existe nce. I know that I am presenti ng the solution in difficult terms, but there is nothing difficult in the Word of Truth. But since the Solution appeared so as not to leave anything hidden , but to reveal all things openly concer ning existence - the destruction of evil on the one hand, the revelation of the elect on the other. This is the eman ation of Truth and Spirit, Grace is of the Truth. The Savior swallowed up death - (of this) you are not reckoned as being ignora nt - for he put aside the world which is perish ing. He transformed himself into an imperishable Aeon and raised himse lf up, having swallo wed the visible by the invisible, and he gave us the way of our immortal ity. Then, indeed, as the Apostl e said, \"We suffered with him, and we arose with him, and we went to heaven with him\". Now if we are manifest in this world wearing him, we are that one`s beams, and we are e mbraced by him until our setting, that is to say, our death in this life. We are drawn to heaven by him, like beams by the sun, not being restrained by anything. This is the spiritual resurrection which swallows up the psych ic in the same way as the fleshly. But if there is one who does not believe, he does not have the (capacity to be) persuaded. For it is the domain of faith, my son, and not that which belongs to persuasi on: the dead shall arise! There is one who believes among the philsophers who are in this world. At least he will arise. And let not the philosopher who is in this world have cause to believe that he is one who returns himself by himself - and (that) because of our faith! For we have known the Son of Man, and we have believed that he rose from among the dead. This is he of whom we say, \"He became the destruction of death, as he is a great one in whom they believe.\" Great are those who believe. The thought of those who are saved shall not perish. The mind of those who have known him shall not perish. Therefore, we are elected to salvation and redemption since we are predestined from the begin ning not to fall into the foolishness of those who are without knowledge, but we shall enter into the wisdom of those who have known the Truth. Indeed, the Truth which is kept cannot be abandoned, nor has it been. \"Strong is the system of the Pleroma; small is that which broke loose (and) became (the) world. But the All is what is encompassed. It has not come into being; it was existing.\" So, never doubt concerning the resurrection, my son Rheginos ! For if you were not existing in flesh, you received flesh when you entered this world. Why will you not receive flesh when you ascend into the Aeon? That which is better than the flesh is that which is for (the) cause of life. That which came into being on your accou nt, is it not yours? Does not that which is yours exist with you? Yet, while you are in this world, what is it that you lack? This is what you have been making every effort to learn. - 3 8 -"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The afterbirth of the body is old age, and you exist in corruption. You have absenc e as a gain.

But the All which we are, we are saved. We have received salvation from end to end. Let us think in this way! Let us comprehend in this way! But there are some (who) wish to understan d, in the enquiry about those things they are looking into, whether he who is saved, if he leaves his body behind, will be saved immediate ly. Let no one doubt concerning this. [...]. indeed, the visible members which are dead shall not be saved, for (only) the living members which exist within them would arise. What, then, is the resurrection? It is always the disclosure of those who have risen. For if you rememb er reading in the Gospel that Elijah appeared and Moses with him, do not think the resurrectio n is an illusion. It is no illusion, but it is truth! Indeed, it is more fitting to say the world is an illusion, rather than the resurrectio n which has come into being through our Lord the Savior, Jesus Christ. But what am I telling you now? Those who are living shall die. How do they live in an illusion? The rich have become poor, and the kings have been overthrown. Everything is prone to change. The world is an illusion! - lest, indeed, I rail at things to excess! But the resurrectio n does not have this aforesaid character, for it is the truth which stands firm. It is the revelation of what is, and the transformation of things, and a transition into newness. For imperishability descends upon the perishab le; the light flows down upon the darkness, swallowing it up; and the Pleroma fills up the deficiency. These are the symbols and the images of the resurrectio n. He it is who makes the good. Theref ore, do not think in part, O Rhegi nos, nor live in conformity with this flesh for the sake of unani mity, but flee from the divisions and the fetters, and already you ha ve the resurrection. For if he who will die knows about himse lf that he will die - even if he spends many years in this life, he is brought to this - why not consider yoursel f as risen and (alread y) brought to this? If you have the resurrection but continue as if you are to die - and yet that one knows that he has died - why, then, do I ignore your lack of exercise? It is fitting for each one to practic e in a number of ways, and he shall be released from this Element that he may not fall into error but shall himsel f receive again what at first was.

Att ridge and D iete r M ueller Selection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library , revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francis co, 1990. Part I 1. In troduc tion As for what we can say about the things which are exalte d, what is fitting is that we begin with the Father, who is the root of the Totality, the one from whom we have received grace to speak about him. 2. The Fat her He existe d before anything other than himself came into being. The Father is a single one, like a numbe r, for he is the first one and the one who is only himself. Yet he is not like a solitary individual. Otherwise, how could he be a father? For whenever there is a \"father,\" the name \"son\" follows. But the single one, who alone is the Father, is like a root, wi th tree, branches and fruit. It is said of him that he is a father in the proper sense, since he is inimitable and immutable. Because of this, he is single in the proper sense, and is a god, because no one is a god for him nor is anyone a father to him. For he is unbegotte n, and there is no other who begot him, nor another who created him. For whoe ver is someone's father or his creator, he, too, has a father and creator. It is certainly possible for him to be father and creator of the one who came into being from him and the one whom he created, for he is not a father in the proper sense, nor a god, because he has someone who begot him and who created him. It is, then, only the Father and God in the proper sense that no one else begot. As for the Totaliti es, he is the one who begot them and created them. He is without beginning and without end. Not only is he without end - He is immortal for this reason, that he is unbegotten - but he is also invariable in his eternal existence, in his identity , in that by which he is established, and in that by which he is great. Neither will he remove himse lf from that by which he is, nor will anyone else force him to produce an end which he has not ever desired. He has not had anyone who initiated his own existenc e. Thus, he is himself unchanged, and no one else can remove him from his existence and his identity, that in which he is, and his greatness, so that he cannot be grasped; nor is it possible for anyone else to change him into a different form, or to reduce him, or alter him or diminish him, - since this is so in the fullest sense of the truth - who is the unalterable, immutable one, with immutability clothing him. Not only is he the one called \"without a beginning\" and \"without an end,\" because he is unbegotten and immortal; but just as he has no beginning and no end as he is, he is unattainable in his greatness, inscrutable in his wisdom, incomprehensible in his power, and unfathoma ble in his sweetness. In the proper sense, he alone - the good, the unbegotten Father, and the comple te perfect one - is the one filled with all his offspring, and with every virtue, and with everything of value. And he has more, that is, lack of any malice, in order that it may be discov ered that whoever has anythi ng is indebted to him, because he gives it, being himse lf unreac hable and unwearied by that which he gives, since he is wealthy in the gifts which he bestows, and at rest in the favors which he grants. He is of such a kind and form and great magnitude that no one else has been with him from the beginning; nor is there a place in which he is, or from which he has come forth, or into which he will go; nor is there a primordia l form, which he uses as a model as he works; nor is there any difficulty which accompanies him in what he does; nor is there any material which is at his disposal, from which <he> creates what he creates; nor any substance within him from which he - 4 0 -"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"begets what he begets; nor a co-worker with him, workin g with him on the things at which he works. To say anyth ing of this sort is ignorant. Rather, (one should speak of him) as good, faultless, perfect, complete, being himself the Totality. Not one of the names which are conceived or spoken, seen or grasped - not one of them applies to him, even though they are exceedi ngly glorious, magnifying and honored. However, it is possible to utter these names for his glory and honor, in accordance with the capac ity of each of those who give him glory. Yet as for him, in his own existence, being and form, it is impossible for mind to conceive him, nor can any speech convey him, nor can any eye see him, nor can any body grasp him, because of his inscrutable greatness, and his incompr ehensible depth, and his immeasurable height, and his illimitable will. This is the nature of the unbegotte n one, which does not touch anyth ing else; nor is it joined (to anythi ng) in the manner of something which is limited. Rather, he posses ses this constitut ion, without having a face or a form, things which are understood through perceptio n, whence also comes (the epithet) \"the incompre hensible. If he is incompre hensible, then it follows that he is unknowable, that he is the one who is inconceivable by any though t, invisible by any thing, ineffable by any word, untouc hable by any hand. He alone is the one who knows himself as he is, along with his form and his greatness and his magnitude. And since he has the ability to conce ive of himse lf, to see himself, to name himself, to comprehend himse lf, he alone is the one who is his own mind, his own eye, his own mouth, his own form, and he is what he thinks, what he sees, what he speaks, what he grasps, himself , the one who is inconceivable, ineffable, incompre hensible, immutable, while sustaini ng, joyous, true, delightful, and restful is that which he conceives, that which he sees, that about which he speaks, that which he has as thought. He transce nds all wisdom, and is above all intellect, and is above all glory, and is above all beauty, and all sweetness, and all greatness, and any depth and any height. If this one, who is unknowable in his nature, to whom pertain all the greatnesses which I already mentio ned - if, out of the abundance of his sweetnes s, he wishes to grant knowledge, so that he might be known, he has the ability to do so. He has his Power, which is his will. Now, howev er, in silence he himse lf holds back, he who is the great one, who is the cause of bringing the Totalit ies into their etern al being. It is in the proper sense that he begets himsel f as ineffable, since he alone is self-begotten, since he conceives of himsel f, and since he knows himse lf as he is. What is worth y of his admiratio n and glory and honor and praise, he produces because of the boundlessness of his greatness, and the unsearchability of his wisdom, and the immeasurability of his powe r, and his untasteab le sweetness . He is the one who projects himse lf thus, as generatio n, having glory and honor marvelous and lovely; the one who glorifies himse lf, who marvels, <who > honors, who also loves; the one who has a Son, who subsists in him, who is silent concerning him, who is the ineffable one in the ineffable one, the invisible one, the incomprehensible one, the inconceivable one in the inconceivable one. Thus, he exists in him foreve r. The Father, in the way we mentio ned earlier , in an unbegotten way, is the one in whom he knows himself, who begot him having a thought, which is the thoug ht of him, that is, the perception of him, which is the [...] of his constitution forever. That is, howe ver, in the proper sense, the silence and the wisdom and the grace, if it is designated properly in this way. 3. The Son and the Chur ch Just as the Father exists in the proper sense, the one before whom there was no one else, and the one apart from whom there is no other unbegotten one, so too the Son exists in the proper sense, the one before whom there was no other, and after whom no other son exists. Therefore, he is a firstborn and an only Son, \"firstbor n\" because no one exists before him and \"only Son\" because no one is after him. Furthermore, he has his fruit, that which is unknowable because of its surpassing greatness. Yet he wanted it to be known, because of the riches of his sweetness. And he revealed the unexplai nable power, and he combined with it the great abundance of his generosity. Not only did the Son exist from the begin ning, but the Church, too, existed from the begin ning. Now, he who thinks that the discove ry that the Son is an only son opposes the statement (about the Church) because of the mysterious quality of the matter, it is not so. For just as the Father is a - 4 1 -"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"unity, and has revealed himse lf as Father for him alone, so too the Son was found to be a brother to himse lf alone, in virtue of the fact that he is unbegotten and without beginning. He wonders at himse lf, along with the Father, and he gives him(self) glory and honor and love. Furthermor e, he too is the one whom he conceives of as Son, in accorda nce with the dispositions: \"without beginning\" and \"without end.\" Thus is the matter somethi ng which is fixed. Being innumera ble and illimitable, his offspri ng are indivisible. Those which exist have come forth from the Son and the Father like kisses, because of the multitude of some who kiss one another with a good, insatiable thoug ht, the kiss being a unity, althou gh it involves many kisses. This is to say, it is the Churc h consisting of many men that existed before the aeons, which is called, in the proper sense, \"the aeons of the aeons.\" This is the nature of the holy imperishable spirits, upon which the Son rests, since it is his essence, just as the Father rests upon the Son. 4. Aeoni c Emana tions [...] the Church exists in the disposi tions and properties in which the Father and the Son exist, as I have said from the start. Therefore, it subsists in the procreations of innumera ble aeons. Also in an uncountab le way they too beget, by the properties and the dispositions in which it (the Churc h) exists. For these comprise its associatio n which they form toward one another and toward those who have come forth from them toward the Son, for whose glory they exist. Therefore, it is not possible for mind to conceive of him - He was the perfectio n of that place - nor can speech express them, for they are ineffable and unnameable and inconceivable. They alone have the ability to name themsel ves and to conceive of themsel ves. For they have not been rooted i n these place s. Those of that place are ineffable, (and) innumerab le in the system which is both the manner and the size, the joy, the gladness of the unbegotten, nameless, unnameable, inconceivable, invisible, incompre hensible one. It is the fullness of patern ity, so that his abundance is a begetti ng [...] of the aeons. They were forever in thoug ht, for the Father was like a though t and a place for them. When their generation s had been established, the one who is comple tely in control wished to lay hold of and to bring forth that which was deficient in the [...] and he brought forth those [...] him. But since he is as he is, he is a spring, which is not diminished by the water which abundantly flows from it. While they were in the Father's thought, that is, in the hidden depth, the depth knew them, but they were unable to know the depth in which they were; nor was it possible for them to know themse lves, nor for them to know anything else. That is, they were with the Father; they did not exist for themse lves. Rather, they only had existen ce in the manner of a seed, so that it has been discovered that they existed like a fetus. Like the word he begot them, subsisting sperm atically, and the ones whom he was to beget had not yet come into being from him. The one who first thought of them, the Father, - not only so that they might exist for him, but also that they might exist for themsel ves as well, that they might then exist in his thought as mental substance and that they might exist for themselves too, - sowed a though t like a spermatic seed. Now, in order that they might know what exists for them, he graciously granted the initial form, while in order that they might recogn ize who is the Father who exists for them, he gave them the name \"Father\" by means of a voice proclaiming to them that what exists, exists through that name, which they have by virtue of the fact that they came into being, because the exaltation, which has escaped their notice, is in the name. The infant, while in the form of a fetus has enough for itself, before ever seeing the one who sowed it. Therefore, they had the sole task of search ing for him, realizing that he exists, ever wishing to find out what exists. Since, howe ver, the perfect Father is good, just as he did not hear them at all so that they would exist (only) in his thought, but rather granted that they, too, might come into being, so also will he give them grace to know what exists, that is, the one who knows himse lf eternal ly, [...] form to know what exists, just as people are begotten in this place: when they are born, they are in the light, so that they see those who have begotten them. The Father brought forth everyth ing, like a little child, like a drop from a spring, like a blossom from a vine, like a flower, like a <planting> [...], in need of gaining nourishme nt and growth and faultlessness. He withheld it for a time. He who had though t of it from the very beginning, - 4 2 -"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"possessed it from the very beginning, and saw it, but he closed it off to those who first came from him. (He did this,) not out of envy, but in order that the aeons might not receive their faultlessness from the very beginning and might not exalt themsel ves to the glory, to the Father, and might think that from themselv es alone they have this. But just as he wished to grant that they might come into being, so too, in order that they might come into being as faultless ones, when he wished, he gave them the perfect idea of benef icence toward them. The one whom he raised up as a light for those who came from himse lf, the one from whom they take their name, he is the Son, who is full, complete and faultless. He brought him forth mingled with what came forth from him [...] partaking of the [...] the Totality, in accordance with [...] by which each one can receive him for himself, though such was not his greatness before he was received by it. Rather, he exists by himself. As for the parts in which he exists in his own manner and form and greatness, it is possib le for <them> to see him and speak about that which they know of him, since they wear him while he wears them, because it is possible for them to comprehend him. He, howev er, is as he is, incomparab le. In order that the Father might receive honor from each one and reveal himself, even in his ineffability, hidden, and invisible, they marvel at him mental ly. Therefore, the greatn ess of his loftiness consists in the fact that they speak about him and see him. He becomes manif est, so that he may be hymned because of the abundance of his sweetness, with the grace of <...>. And just as the admiratio ns of the silences are eternal generations and they are mental offspri ng, so too the dispositions of the word are spiritua l emanatio ns. Both of them admiratio ns and dispositions, since they belong to a word, are seeds and thoughts of his offspri ng, and roots which live forever, appearing to be offspr ing which have come forth from themselves, being minds and spiritual offspr ing to the glory of the Father. There is no need for voice and spirit, mind and word, because there is no need to work at that which they desire to do, but on the pattern by which he was existing, so are those who have come forth from him, begetting everyth ing which they desire. And the one whom they conceive of, and whom they speak about, and the one toward whom they move, and the one in whom they are, and the one whom they hymn, thereby glorifying him, he has sons. For this is their procreative power, like those from whom they have come, according to their mutual assistance, since they assist one anoth er like the unbegotten ones. The Father, in accordance with his exalte d position over the Totalities, being an unknown and incompre hensible one, has such greatness and magnitude, that, if he had revealed himsel f suddenly, quickly, to all the exalted ones among the aeons who had come forth from him, they would have perished. Therefore, he withheld his power and his inexhaustibility within that in which he is. He is ineffable and unnameab le and exalted above every mind and every word. This one, however, stretched himself out and it was that which he stretched out which gave a foundation and a space and a dwelling place for the universe, a name of his being \"the one through whom,\" since he is Father of the All, out of his laboring for those who exist, having sown into their thought that they might seek after him. The abundance of their [...] consists in the fact that they understand that he exists and in the fact that they ask what it is that was existing. This one was given to them for enjoyment and nourishment and joy and an abundance of illumination, which consists in his fellow labori ng, his knowledge and his mingling with them, that is, the one who is called and is, in fact, the Son, since he is the Totalities and the one of whom they know both who he is and that it is he who clothes. This is the one who is called \"Son\" and the one of whom they understand that he exists and they were seeking after him. This is the one who exists as Father and (as) the one about whom they cannot speak, and the one of whom they do not conceive. This is the one who first came into being. It is impossi ble for anyone to conceive of him or think of him. Or can anyone approach there, toward the exalte d one, toward the preexistent in the proper s ense? But all the names conce ived or spoken about him are presented in honor , as a trace of him, according to the ability of each one of those who glorify him. Now he who arose from him when he stretched himself out for begetting and for knowledge on the part of the Totalities, he [...] all of the names, without falsification, and he is, in the proper sense, the sole first one, the man of the Father, that is, the one whom I call the form of the formless, - 4 3 -"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"the body of the bodiless, the face of the invisible, the word of the unutterable, the mind of the inconceivable, the founta in which flowed from him, the root of those who are planted, and the god of those who exist, the light of those whom he illumines, the love of those whom he loved, the provide nce of those for whom he provide ntially cares, the wisdom of those whom he made wise, the power of those to whom he gives power, the assembly of those whom he assembles to him, the revelat ion of the things which are sought after, the eye of those who see, the breath of those who breathe, the life of those who live, the unity of those who are mixed with the Totalit ies. All of them exist in the single one, as he clothes himse lf completel y and by his single name he is never called. And in this unique way they are equally the single one and the Totalities. He is neither divided as a body, nor is he separated into the names which he has received, (so that) he is one thing in this way and another in another way. Also, neither does he change in [...], nor does he turn into the names which he thinks of, and become now this, now something else, this thing now being one thing and, at another time, somethi ng else, but rather he is wholly himself to the uttermost. He is each and every one of the Totalit ies forever at the same time. He is what all of them are. He brought the Father to the Totalities. He also is the Totalities, for he is the one who is know ledge for himself and he is each one of the properties . He has the powers and he is beyond all that which he knows, while seeing himself in himsel f complete ly and having a Son and form. Theref ore, his powers and properties are innumerable and inaudible, because of the begetting by which he begets them. Innumerab le and indivisible are the begetti ngs of his words, and his commands and his Totaliti es. He knows them, which things he himsel f is, since they are in the single name, and are all speak ing in it. And he brings (them) forth, in order that it might be discovered that they exist according to their individual properties in a unified way. And he did not reveal the multitude to the Totaliti es at once nor did he reveal his equality to those who had come forth from him. 5. Aeoni c Life All those who came forth from him <who> are the aeons of the aeons, being eman ations and offspr ing of <his> procreative nature, they too, in their procreati ve nature, have <given> glory to the Father, as he was the cause of their establishment. This is what we said previous ly, namely that he creates the aeons as roots and springs and fathers, and that he is the one to whom they give glory. They have begotten, for he has know ledge and wisdom and the Totaliti es knew that it is from knowledge and wisdom that they have come forth. They would have brought forth a seeming honor: \"The Father is the one who is the Totalit ies,\" if the aeons had risen up to give honor individually. Therefore, in the song of glorification and in the power of the unity of him from whom they have come, they w ere drawn into a mingling and a combination and a unity with one another. They offered glory worthy of the Father from the pleromatic congregatio n, which is a single representation althoug h many, because it was brought forth as a glory for the single one and because they came forth toward the one who is himself the Totalities. Now, this was a praise - 4 4 -"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"[...] the on e who brought forth the Totalit ies, being a first -fruit of the immortals and an eternal one, because , having come forth from the living aeons, being perfect and full because of the one who is perfect and full, it left full and perfect those who have given glory in a perfect way because of the fellowship. For, like the faultless Father, when he is glorified he also hears the glory which glorifies him, so as to make them mani fest as that which he is. The cause of the second honor which accrued to them is that which was returned to them from the Father when they had known the grace by which they bore fruit with one another because of the Father. As a result, just as they <were> brough t forth in glory for the Father, so too in order to appear pe rfect, they appeared acting by giving glory. They were fathers of the third glory according to the independence and the powe r which was begotten with them, since each one of them individually does not exist so as to give glory in a unitary way to him whom he love s. They are the first and the second and thus both of them are perfect and full, for they are manifestations of the Father who is perfect and full, as well as of those who came forth, who are perfect by the fact that they glorify the perfect one. The fruit of the third, however, consists of honors of the will of each one of the aeons, and each one of the propertie s. The Father has power. It exists fully, perfect in the thought which is a product of agreement, since it is a product of the individuality of the aeons. It is this which he loves and over which he has powe r, as it gives glory to the Father by mean s of it. For this reason, they are minds of minds, which are found to be words of words, elders of elders, degrees of degrees, which are exalted above one another. Each one of those who give glory has his place and his exaltation and his dwell ing and his rest, which consists of the glory which he brings forth. All those who glorify the Father have their begetting eternal ly, - they beget in the act of assisting one another - since the emanations are limitless and immeasurab le and since there is no envy on the part of the Father toward those who came forth from him in regard to their begetting something equal or similar to him, since he is the one who exists in the Totalities, begetti ng and revealing himsel f. Whome ver he wishes, he makes into a father, of whom he in fact is Father, and a god, of whom he in fact is God, and he makes them the Totalities, whose entirety he is. In the proper sense all the names which are great are kept there, these (names) which the angels share, who have come into being in the cosmos along with the archon s, although they do not have any resemblance to the eternal beings. The entire system of the aeons has a love and a longing for the perfect, complete discov ery of the Father and this is their unimpeded agreement. Though the Father reveals himself eternally, he did not wish that they should know him, since he grants that he be conceived of in such a way as to be sought for, while keeping to himself his unsearchable primordial being. It is he, the Father, who gave root impulses to the aeons, since they are places on the path which leads toward him, as toward a school of behavior. He has extended to them faith in and prayer to him whom they do not see; and a firm hope in him of whom they do not conceive; and a fruitful love, which looks toward that which it does not see; and an acceptab le understand ing of the eternal mind; and a blessing, which is riches and freedom; and a wisdom of the one who desires the glory of the Father for <his> thought. It is by virtue of his will that the Father, the one who is exalted, is known, that is, (by virtue of) the spirit which breathes in the Totalit ies and it gives them an idea of seeking after the unkno wn one, just as one is drawn by a pleasant aroma to search for the thing from which the aroma arises, since the aroma of the Father surpasses these ordinary ones. For his sweetnes s leaves the aeons in ineffable pleasure and it gives them their idea of mingling with him who wants them to know him in a united way and to assist one another in the spirit which is sown within them. Though existi ng under a great weight, they are renewed in an inexpr essible way, since it is imposs ible for them to be separated from that in which they are set in an uncomprehending way, because they will not speak, being silent about the Father's glory, about the one who has power to speak, and yet they will take form from him. He revealed himse lf, though it is impossi ble to speak of him. They have - 4 5 -"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"him, hidden in a thought, since from this one [...]. They are silent about the way the Father is in his form and his nature and his greatness, while the aeons have become worthy of knowin g through his spirit that he is unnameable and incomprehensible. It is through his spirit, which is the trace of the search for him, that he provi des them the ability to con ceive of him and to speak about him. Each one of the aeons is a name, <that is>, each of the properties and powers of the Father, since he exists in many names, which are interm ingled and harmonious with one another. It is possible to speak of him because of the wealt h of speech, just as the Father is a single name, because he is a unity, yet is innumerable in his properties and names. The eman ation of the Totalities, which exist from the one who exists, did not occur accordi ng to a separation from one another, as somethin g cast off from the one who begets them. Rather, their begettin g is like a process of extension, as the Father extends himse lf to those whom he loves, so that those who have come forth from him might become him as well. Just as the present aeon, though a unity, is divided by units of time and units of time are divided into years and years are divided into seasons and seasons into months, and months into days, and days into hours, and hours into moments, so too the aeon of the Truth , since it is a unity and multiplicity, receives honor in the small and the great names according to the power of each to grasp i t - by way of analogy - like a spring which is what it is, yet flo ws into streams and lakes and canals and branc hes, or like a root spread out beneat h trees and branches with its fruit, or like a human body, which is partitioned in an indivisible way into members of members, primary memb ers and secondary, great and small. 6. The Imperfe ct Begetting by the Lo gos The aeons have brought themselves forth in accord with the third fruit by the freedom of the will and by the wisdom with which he favored them for their thought. They do not wish to give honor with that which is from an agreement, though it was produced for words of praise for each of the Pleroma s. Nor do they wish to give honor with the Totality. Nor do they wish (to do so) with anyon e else who was originally above the depth of that one, or (above) his place, except, howev er, for the one who exists in an exalted name and in the exalted place, and only if he receives from the one who wished (to give honor), and takes it to him(self) for the one above him, and (only if) he begets him(self), so to speak, himself , and, through that one, begets him(se lf) along with that which he is, and himself becomes renew ed along with the one who came upon him, by his brother, and sees him and entreats him about the matter, namely, he who wished to ascend to him. So that it might be in this way, the one who wished to give honor does not say anyth ing to him about this, except only that there is a limit to speech set in the Pleroma, so that they are silent about the incompre hensibility of the Father, but they speak about the one who wishes to comprehend him. It came to one of the aeons that he should attempt to grasp the incompre hensibility and give glory to it and especially to the ineffability of the Father. Since he is a Logos of the unity, he is one, though he is not from the agreement of the Totalities, nor from him who brought them forth, namely, the one who brought forth the Tota lity, the Father. This aeon was among those to whom was given wisdom, so that he could become pre-existent in each one's thought. By that which he wills, will they be produced. Therefore, he received a wise nature in order to examine the hidde n basis, since he is a wise fruit; for, the free will which was begotten with the Totalities was a cause for this one, such as to make him do what he desired, with no one to restrain him. The intent, then, of the Logos, who is this one, was good. When he had come forth, he gave glory to the Father, even if it led to somethi ng beyon d possibility, since he had wanted to bring forth one who is perfect, from an agreement in which he had not been, and without having the command. This aeon was last to have <been > brought forth by mutual assistan ce, and he was small in magn itude. And before he begot anythi ng else for the glory of the will and in agreement with the Totaliti es, he acted, magnanimous ly, from an abunda nt love, and set out toward that which - 4 6 -"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"surrounds the perfect glory, for it was not without the will of the Father that the Logos was produce d, which is to say, not without it will he go forth. But he, the Father, had brought him forth for those about whom he knew that it was fitting that they should come into being. The Father and the Totalities drew away from him, so that the limit which the Father had set might be established - for it is not from grasping the incom prehensibility but by the will of the Father, - and furthermore, (they withdrew) so that the things which have come to be might become an organizat ion which would come into being. If it were to come, it would not come into being by the manifestatio n of the Pleroma. Therefore, it is not fitting to criticize the movement which is the Logos, but it is fitting that we should say about the move ment of the Logos that it is a cause of an organiza tion which has been destined to come about. The Logos himse lf cause d it to happen, being complete and unitar y, for the glory of the Father, whom he desired, and (he did so) being content with it, but those whom he wished to take hold of firmly he begot in shadows and copies and likenesses. For, he was not able to bear the sight of the light, but he looked into the depth and he doubted. Out of this there was a division - he became deeply troubled - and a turning away because of his self-doubt and division, forgetfulness and ignoran ce of himse lf and <of that> which is. His self-exaltation and his expectation of comprehend ing the incompre hensible became firm for him and was in him. But the sicknesses followed him when he went beyond himse lf, having come into being from self-doubt, namely from the fact that he did not <reac h the attainment of> the glorie s of the Father, the one whose exalted status is among things unlimited. This one did not attain him, for he did not receive him. The one whom he himse lf brought forth as a unitary aeon rushed up to that which is his and this kin of his in the Pleroma abandoned him who came to be in the defect along with those who had come forth from him in an imaginary way, since they are not his. When he who produced himself as perfect actuall y did bring himsel f forth, he became weak like a female nature which has abandoned its virile counterpa rt. From that which was deficient in itself there came those things which came into being from his thought and his arrogance, but from that which is perfect in him he left it and raised himse lf up to those who are his. He was in the Pleroma as a remembrance for him so that he would be saved from his arrogan ce. The one who ran on high and the one who drew him to himself were not barren, but in bringing forth a fruit in the Pleroma, they upset those who were in the defect. Like the Pleromas are the things which came into being from the arrogant thought, which are their (the Pleromas') likenesses, copies, shadows, and phanta sms, lacking reason and the light, these which belong to the vain thought, since they are not products of anyth ing. Therefore, their end will be like their beginning: from that which did not exist (they are) to return once again to that which will not be. It is they, howev er, by themse lves who are greater, more powerful, and more honored than the names which are given to them, which are their shadows. In the manner of a reflec tion are they beautiful. For the face of the copy normal ly takes its beauty from that of which it is a copy. They thought of themselv es that they are beings existin g by themsel ves and are without a source , since they do not see anything else existing before them. Therefore, they lived in disobedience and acts of rebellion, without having humbl ed themsel ves before the one because of whom they came into being. They wanted to command one another, overcoming one another in their vain ambit ion, while the glory which they possess contains a cause of the system which was to be. They are likenesses of the things which are exalted. They were brought to a lust for power in each one of them, according to the greatness of the name of which each is a shadow, each one imagining that it is superior to his fellow s. The thought of these others was not barren, but just like <those> of which they are shadows, all that they thought about they have as potential sons; those of whom they thought they had as - 4 7 -"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"offspr ing. Therefor e, it happened that many offspr ing came forth from them, as fighters, as warriors, as troublemakers, as apostates. They are disob edient beings, lovers of power. All the other beings of this sort were brought forth from th ese. 7. The Con version of the Logos The Logos was a cause of those who came into being and he continued all the more to be at a loss and he was astonished. Instead of perfection, he saw a defect; instead of unification, he saw division; instead of stability, he saw disturbances; instead of rests, tumults. Neither was it possible for him to make them cease from loving disturban ce, nor was it possib le for him to destroy it. He was complete ly powe rless, once his totali ty and his exaltatio n abandoned him. Those who had come into being not knowi ng themsel ves both did not know the Pleromas from which they came forth and did not know the one who was the cause of their existence. The Logos, being in such unstable condit ions, did not continue to bring forth anything like emanatio ns, the things which are in the Pleroma, the glories which exist for the honor of the Father. Rather, he brought forth little weakl ings, hindered) by the illnesses by which he too was hindered. It was the likeness of the disposition which was a unity, that which was the cause of the things which do not themselves exist from th e first. Until the one who brought forth into the defect these things which were thus in need, until he judged those who came into being because of him contrary to reason - which is the judgment which became a condem nation - he struggled against them unto destruc tion, that is, the ones who struggled against the condem nation and whom the wrath pursues, while it (the wrath ) accepts and redeems (them) from their (false) opinion and apostasy, since from it is the conversion which is also called \"metanoia.\" The Logos turned to another opinio n and another thought. Having turned away from evil, he turned toward the good things. Following the conversion came the thought of the things which exist and the pray er for the one who converted himsel f to the good . The one who is in the Pleroma was what he first prayed to and remembered; then (he rememb ered) his brothers individually and (yet) always with one another; then all of them together; but before all of them, the Father. The prayer of the agreement was a help for him in his own return and (in that of) the Totality, for a cause of his rememberi ng those who have existed from the first was his being remembe red. This is the thought which calls out from afar, bringing him back. All his prayer and remembe ring were numerous powers according to that limit. For there is nothing barren in his thought. The powers were good and were greater than those of the likeness. For those belonging to the likeness also belong to a nature of falsehoo d. From an illusion of similarity and a thought of arrogance has come about that which they became. And they originate from the thought which first knew them. To what do the former beings pertain ? They are like forgetfulness and heavy sleep; being like those who dream troubled dreams, to whom sleep comes while they - those who dream - are oppres sed. The others are like some creatures of light for him, lookin g for the rising of the sun, since it happened that they saw in him dreams which are truly sweet. It immediate ly put a stop to the emanations of the thought. They did not any longer have their substance and also they did not have honor any longer. Though he is not equal to those who pre-existed, if they were superior to the likenesses, it was he alone throug h whom they were mor e exalted than those, for they are not from a good intent . It was not from the sickness which came into being that they were produced, from which is the good intent, but (from ) the one who sought after the pre-existent. Once he had prayed, he both raised himse lf to the good and sowed in them a pre-disposition to seek and pray to the glorious pre-existent one, and he sowed in them a thoug ht about him and an idea, so that they should think that somethi ng greater than themse lves exists prior to them, although they did not - 4 8 -"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"understand what it was. Begetting harmony and mutual love through that thought, they acted in unity and unanimity, since from unity and from unanimity they have received their very being. They were stronger than them in the lust for powe r, for they were more honor ed than the first ones, who had been raised above them. Those had not humb led themse lves. They thought about themse lves that they were beings originating from themse lves alone and were without a source. As they brought forth at first according to their own birth, the two orders assaulted one another, fighting for comma nd because of their mann er of being. As a result, they were submerged in forces and natures in accord with the condit ion of mutual assault, having lust for power and all other things of this sort. It is from these that the vain love of glory draws all of them to the desire of the lust for power, while none of them has the exalted thought nor acknowledges it. The powers of this thought are prepared in the works of the pre-existent <ones>, those of which they are the representatio ns. For the order of those of this sort had mutua l harmony, but it fought against the order of those of the likeness, while the order of those of the likeness wages war against the representations and acts against it alone, because of its wrath. From this it [...] them [...] one another, many [...] necess ity appointed them [...] and might prevail [...] was not a multitude, [...] and their envy and their [...] and their wrath and violence and desire and prevailing ignora nce produce empty matters and powers of various sorts, mixed in great number with one anoth er; while the mind of the Logos, who was a cause of their begettin g, was open to a revelation of the hope which would come to him from above. 8. T he Emana tion of the Savio r The Logos which moved had the hope and the expectation of him who is exalted. As for those of the shadow, he separated himse lf from them in every way, since they fight against him and are not at all humble before him. He was content with the beings of the thought. And as for the one who is set up in this way and who is within the exalted boundary, rememberin g the one who is defecti ve, the Logos brough t him forth in an invisible way, among those who came into being according to the thought, according to the one who was with them, until the light shone upon him from above as a lifegiver, the one who was begotten by the thought of brotherly love of the pre- existent Pleromas. The stumbl ing, which happened to the aeons of the Father of the Totalities who did not suffer, was brought to them, as if it were their own, in a careful and non-malicious and immensely sweet way. It was brought to the Totalitie s so that they might be instructed about the defect by the single one, from whom alone they all received strength to eliminate the defects. The order which was his came into being from him who ran on high and that which brought itself forth from him and from the entire perfect ion. The one who ran on high became for the one who was defective an intercessor with the emanation of the aeons which had come into being in accord with the things which exist. When he prayed to them, they consented joyously and willingly, since they were in agreement, and with harmonious consent, to aid the defective one. They gathered together, asking the Father with benef icent intent that there be aid from above, from the Father, for his glory, since the defective one could not becom e perfect in any other way, unless it was the will of the Pleroma of the Father, which he had drawn to himse lf, reveal ed, and given to the defecti ve one. Then from the harmony, in a joyous willingness which had come into being, they brought forth the fruit, which was a begetting from the harmony, a unity, a possession of the Totaliti es, reveali ng the countena nce of the Father, of whom the aeons thought as they gave glory and prayed for help for their brother with a wish in which the Father counted himself with them. Thus, it was willingly and gladly that they bring forth the fruit. And he made manifest the agreement of the revelation of his union with them, which is his beloved Son. But the Son in whom the Totalit ies are pleased put himse lf on them as a garment, through which he gave perfection to the defective one, and gave confirmatio n to those who are perfect, the one who is properly called \"Savior\" and \"the Redeemer\" and \"the Well-Pleasing one\" and \"the Beloved,\" \"the one to whom prayers have been offered\" and \"the Christ\" and \"the Light of those appointed,\" in accordance with the ones from whom he was brough t forth, since he has become the names of the - 4 9 -"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"positions which were given to him. Yet, what other name may be applied to him except \"the Son,\" as we previous ly said, since he is the knowledge of the Father, whom he wanted them to know? Not only did the aeons generate the countenance of the Father to whom they gave praise, which was written previously, but also they generated their own; for the aeons who give glory generated their countena nce and their face. They were produced as an army for him, as for a king, since the beings of the thought have a powerful fellowship and an interm ingled harmony. They came forth in a multifaceted form, in order that the one to whom help was to be given might see those to whom he had prayed for help. He also sees the one who gave it to him. The fruit of the agreement with him, of which we previous ly spoke, is subject to the power of the Totaliti es. For the Father has set the Totalit ies within him, both the ones which pre-exist and the ones which are, and the ones which will be. He was capable (of doing it). He revealed those which he had placed within him. He did not give them, when he entrusted them to him. He directed the organ ization of the universe according to the authority which was given him from the first and (accord ing to) the power of the task. T hus, he began and effected his revelation. The one in whom the Father is and the one in whom the Totaliti es are <was> created before the one who lacked sight. He instructed him about those who searched for their sight, by means of the shining of that perfect light. He first perfected him in ineffable joy. He perfected him for himse lf as a perfect one and he also gave him what is appropriate to each individual. For this is the determinat ion of the first joy. And <he> sowed in him in an invisible way a word which is destined to be knowledge. And he gave him power to separate and cast out from himself those who are disobed ient to him. Thus, he made himsel f manife st to him. But to those who came into being because of him he revealed a form surpassing them. They acted in a hostile way toward one another. Suddenly he revealed himsel f to them, approaching them in the form of lightning. And in putting an end to the entanglement which they have with one another he stopped i t by the sudden revelation, which they were not informed about, did not expect, and did not know of. Because of this, they were afraid and fell down, since they were not able to bear the appearance of the light which struck them. The one who appeared was an assault for the two orders. Just as the beings of thought had been given the name \"little one,\" so they have a faint notio n that they have the exalted one, he exists before them, and they have sown within them an attitude of amazement at the exalted one who will become manifest. Therefore, they welcomed his revelatio n and they worshipped him. They became convinced witnesses to <him>. They acknowledged the light which had come into being as one stronger than those who fought against them. The beings of the likeness, however, were exceedi ngly afraid, since they were not able to hear about him in the beginning, that there is a vision of this sort. Therefore they fell down to the pit of ignorance which is called \"the Outer Darkness,\" and \"Chaos\" and \"Hades\" and \"the Abyss.\" He set up what was beneath the order of the beings of thought, as it was stronger than they. They were worthy of ruling over the unspeaka ble darkness, since it is theirs and is the lot which was assigned to them. He granted them that they, too, should be of use for the organizat ion which was to come, to which he had assigned them. There is a great difference between the revelatio n of the one who came into being to the one who was defective and to those things which are to come into being because of him. For he revealed himse lf to him within him, since he is with him, is a fellow sufferer with him, gives him rest little by little, makes him grow, lifts him up, gives himself to him complete ly for enjoyment from a vision. But to those who fall outside, he revealed himself quickly and in a striking way and he withdrew to himse lf suddenly without having let them see him. 9. The Pleroma of the Logos When the Logos which was defecti ve was illumined, his Pleroma began. He escaped those who had disturbed him at first. He became unmixed with them. He strippe d off that arrogant thought. He received mingl ing with the Rest, when those who had been disobed ient to him at first bent down and humbled themselv es before him. And he rejoi ced over the visitation of his brothers who had visited him. He gave glory and praise to those who had become manifest as a help to him, while he gave thanks, because he had escaped those who revolted against him, and admired and - 5 0 -"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"honored the greatness and those who had appeared to him in a determined way. He genera ted manifest images of the living visages, pleasing among things which are good, existing among the things which exist, resembling them in beauty, but unequa l to them in truth, since they are not from an agreement with him, between the one who brought them forth and the one who revealed himse lf to him. But in wisdom and knowledge he acts, mingling the Logos with him(self) entire ly. Theref ore, those which came forth from him are great, just as that which is truly great. After he was amazed at the beauty of the ones who had appeared to him, he professe d gratitude for this visitation. The Logos performed this activity, through those from whom he had received aid, for the stability of those who had come into being because of him and so that they might receive something good, since he thought to pray for the organization of all those who came forth from him, which is stabilized, so that it might make them established. Therefore, those whom he intentionally produced are in chariots, just as those who came into being, those who have appeared, so that they might pass through every place of things which are below, so that each one might be given the place which is constituted as he is. This is destruction for the beings of the likeness, yet is an act of benef icence for the beings of the thought, a revelatio n Dittography of those who are from the ordinance, which was a unity while sufferi ng, while they are seeds, which have not come to be by themse lves. The one who appeared was a countenance of the Father and of the harmony. He was a garment (composed) of every grace, and food which is for those whom the Logos brought forth while praying and giving glory and honor. This is the one whom he glorified and honor ed while looking to those to whom he prayed, so that he might perfect them through the images which he had brought forth. The Logos added even more to their mutual assistance and to the hope of the promise, since they have joy and abundant rest and undefiled pleasures. He genera ted those whom he remembered at first, when they were not with him, (he generated them) having the perfect ion. Dittography Now, while he who belongs to the vision is with him, he exists in hope and faith in the perfect Father, as much as the Totalities. He appea rs to him before he mingles with him, in order that the things which have come into being might not perish by looking upon the light, for they cannot accept the great, ex alted stature. The thought of the Logos, who had returned to his stability and ruled over those who had come into being because of him, was called \"Aeon\" and \"Place\" of all those whom he had brought forth in accord with the ordinance, and it is also called \"Synagogue of Salvat ion,\" because he healed him (self) from the dispersal, which is the multifa rious thought, and returned to the single thought. Similarly, it is called \"Storehouse,\" because of the rest which he obtained, giving (it) to himsel f alone. And it is also called \"Bride,\" because of the joy of the one who gave himsel f to him in the hope of fruit from the union, and who appeared to him. It is also called \"Kingdom,\" because of the stability which he received, while he rejoices at the dominat ion over those who fought him. And it is called \"the Joy of the Lord,\" because of the gladness in which he clothed himsel f. With him is the light, giving him recompense for the good things which are in him, and (with him is) the thoug ht of freedom. The aeon of which we previously spoke is above the two orders of those who fight against one another. It is not a companio n of those who hold dominio n and is not implicated in the illnesses and weaknesses, things belon ging to the thought and to the likeness. That in which the Logos set himself, perfect in joy, was an aeon, having the form of matter, but also having the constitution of the cause , which is the one who revealed himself. (The aeon was) an image of those things which are in the Pleroma , those things which came into being from the abundance of the enjoyment of the one who exists joyously. Moreover, the counte nance of the one who revealed himsel f, was in the sincerity and the attentiv eness and the promise concerning the things for which he asked. It had the designation of the Son and his essence and his power and his form, who is the one whom he loved and in whom he was pleased, who was entreated in a loving way. It was light and was a desire to be establi shed and an openness for instru ction and an eye for vision, qualities which it had from the exalted ones. It was also wisdom for his thinking in - 5 1 -"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"oppos ition to the things beneath the organizat ion. It was also a word for speakin g and the perfection of the things of this sort. And it is these who took form with him, but accord ing to the image of the Pleroma, having their fathers who are the ones who gave them life, each one being a copy of each one of the faces, which are forms of maleness , since they are not from the illness which is female ness, but are from this one who already has left behind the sickness. It has the name \"the Churc h,\" for in harmony they resemble the harmony in the assembly of those who have revealed themselves. That which came into being in the image of the light, it too is perfect, inasmuc h as it is an image of the one existing light, which is the Totalities. Even if it was inferio r to the one of whom it is an image, nevertheless it has its indivisibility, because it is a countenance of the indivisible light. Those, however, who came into being in the image of each one of the aeons, they in essence are in the one whom we previ ously mentioned, but in power they are not equal, because it (the power) is in each of them. In this mingling with one another they have equality, but each one has not cast off what is peculiar to itself. Therefor e, they are passions, for passion is sickness, since they are producti ons not of the agreement of the Pleroma, but of this one, prematurely, before he received the Father. Hence, the agreement with his Totality and will was somethin g beneficial for the organ ization which was to come. It was granted them to pass through the places which are below, since the places are unable to accom modate their sudden, hasty coming, unless (they come) individually, one by one. Their comi ng is necessary, since by them will everyth ing be perfected. In short, the Logos received the vision of all things, those which pre-exist, and those which are now, and those which will be, since he has been entrusted with the organization of all that which exists. Some things are already in things which are fit for coming into being, but the seeds which are to be he has within himself, because of the promise which belonged to that which he conceived, as somethi ng belonging to seeds which are to be. And he produce d his offspri ng, that is, the revelat ion of that which he conceived. For a while, however, the seed of prom ise is guarded, so that those who have been appointed for a mission might be appointed by the coming of the Savior and of those who are wit h him, the ones who are first in know ledge and glory of the Father. 10. The Organiza tion It is fitting, from the prayer which he made and the conversion which occurred because of it, that some should perish, while others benefit, and still others be set apart. He first prepared the punis hment of those who are disobedient, making use of a power of the one who appeared, the one from whom he received authority over all things, so as to be separate from him. He is the one who is below, and he also keeps himself apart from that which is exalted, until he prepares the organ ization of all those things which are external, and gives to each the place which is assigned to it. The Logos established him(self) at first, when he beautified the Totalities, as a basic principle and cause and ruler of the things which came to be, like the Father, the one who was the cause of the establishment, which was the first to exist after him. He created the pre-existe nt images, which he brought forth in thanks and glorification. Then he beautif ied the place of those whom he had brought forth in glory, which is called \"Paradise\" and \"the Enjoyment\" and \"the Joy full of sustenance\" and \"the Joy,\" which pre-exist. And of every goodness which exists in the Pleroma, it preserves the image. Then he beautified the kingdom, like a city filled with everythi ng pleasing, which is brotherly love and the great generosity, which is filled with the holy spirits and the mighty powe rs which govern them, which the Logos produced and established in power. Then (he beautif ied) the place of the Church which assembles in this place, having the form of the Churc h which exists in the aeons, which glorifies the Father. After these (he beauti fied) the place of the faith and obedien ce (which arises) from hope, which things the Logos received when the light appeared; then (he beautified the place of) the dispos ition, which is prayer and supplication, which were followed by forgiveness and the word concerning the one who would appear. All the spiritua l places are in spiritual power. They are separate from the beings of the thought, since the power is established in an image, which is that which separates the Pleroma from the Logos, while the power which is active in prophesyi ng about the things which will be, directs the - 5 2 -"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"beings of the thoug ht which have come into being toward that which is pre-existent, and it does not permit them to mix with the things which have come into being through a vision of the things which are w ith him. The beings of the though t which is outside are humble; they preserve the representatio n of the pleromatic, especially because of the sharin g in the names by which they are beautif ul. The conversion is humble toward the beings of the thought, and the law, too, is humbl e toward them, (the law) of the judgm ent, which is the condemnation and the wrath. Also humble toward them is the power which separates those who fall below them, sends them far off and does not allow them to spread out over the beings of the thought and the conversion, which (powe r) consists in fear and perplexity and forgetful ness and astonis hment and ignora nce and the things which have come into being in the manner of a likeness, through fantasy. And these things, too, which were in fact lowly, are given the exalte d names. There is no knowledge for those who have come forth from them with arrogance and lust for power and disobedi ence and false hood. To each one he gave a name, since the two orders are in a name. Those belonging to the thought and those of the representation are called \"the Right Ones\" and \"Psychic\" and \"the Fiery Ones\" and \"the Middle Ones.\" Those who belong to the arrogant thought and those of the likeness are called \"the Left\", \"Hylic\", \"the Dark Ones,\" and \"the Last.\" After the Logos established each one in his order, both the images and the repres entations and the likenesses, he kept the aeon of the images pure from all those who fight against it, since it is a place of joy. However, to those of the thought he revealed the though t which he had stripped from himse lf, desiri ng to draw them into a material union, for the sake of their system and dwelling place, and in order that they might also bring forth an impulse for diminution from th eir attraction to evil, so that they might not any more rejoice in the glory of their environment and be dissolv ed, but might rather see their sickness in which they suffer, so that they might beget love and continuou s searching after the one who is able to heal them of the inferiority. Also over those who belon g to the likeness, he set the word of beauty, so that he might bring them into a form. He also set over them the law of judgment. Again, he set over them the powers which the roots had produce d in their lust for power. He appointed them as rulers over them, so that, either by the suppor t of the word which is beauti ful, or by the threat of the law, or by the powe r of lust for power, the order might be preserved from those who have reduced it to evil, while the Logos is pleased with them, since they are useful for the organizat ion. The Logos knows the agreement in the lust for power of the two orders. To these and to all the others, he graciously granted their desire. He gave to each one the appropriate rank, and it was ordered that each one be a ruler over a place and an activity. He yields to the place of the one more exalted than himself, in order to command the other places in an activity which is in the allotted activity which falls to him to have control over because of his mode of being. As a result, there are commanders and subor dinates in positions of dominat ion and subject ion among the angels and archa ngels, while the activities are of various types and are different. Each one of the archons with his race and his perqu isites to which his lot has claim, just as they appear ed, each was on guard, since they have been entrusted with the organization and none lacks a command and none is without kings hip from the end of the heave ns to the end of the earth, even to the foundations of the earth, and to the places beneat h the earth. There are kings, there are lords and those who give commands, some for admin istering punis hment, others for admin istering justice, still others for giving rest and heal ing, others for teach ing, others for guarding. Over all the archons he appoi nted an Archon with no one command ing him. He is the lord of all of them, that is, the countenance which the Logos brought forth in his thought as a representation of the Father of the Totalit ies. Theref ore, he is adorned with every <name > which <is> a repres entation of him, since he is charact erized by every property and glorious quality. For he too is called \"father\" and god\" and \"demiurge\" and \"king\" and \"judge\" and \"place\" and \"dwell ing\" and \"law.\" The Logos uses him as a hand, to beautif y and work on the things below , and he uses him as a mouth, to say the things which will be proph esied. - 5 3 -"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The things which he has spoken he does. When he saw that they were great and good and wonderful, he was pleased and rejoiced, as if he himsel f in his own thought had been the one to say them and do them, not knowing that the move ment within him is from the spirit who moves him in a determined way toward those things which he wants. In regard to the things which came into being from him, he spoke of them, and they came into being as a representatio n of the spiritua l places which we mentioned previously in the discussion about the images. Not only <did> he work, but also, as the one who is appointed as father of his organizatio n, he engendered by himsel f and by the seeds, yet also by the spirit which is elect and which will descend throug h him to the places which are below. Not only does he speak spiritual words of his own, <but> in an invisible way, (he speaks) through the spirit which calls out and begets things greater than his own essence. Since in his essence he is a \"god\" and \"father\" and all the rest of the honorific titles, he was thinking that they were elements of his own essence. He established a rest for those who obey him, but for those who disobey him, he also established punishments. With him, too, there is a parad ise and a kingdom and everything else which exists in the aeon which exists before him. They are more valua ble than the imprints, because of the thought which is connected with them, which is like a shadow and a garment, so to speak, because he does not see in what way the things which exist actual ly do exist. He established workers and servants, assisting in what he will do and what he will say, for in every place where he worked he left his countenance in his beautifu l name, effecting and speaking of the thi ngs which he thinks about. He established in his place images of the light which appeared and of those things which are spiritual, thoug h they were of his own essence. For, thus they were honored in every place by him, being pure, from the counten ance of the one who appointed them, and they were established: parad ises and kingdoms and rests and promises and multitudes of servants of his will, and though they are lords of dominio ns, they are set beneath the one who is lord, the one who appointed them. After he listened to him in this way, properly, about the lights, which are the source and the system, he set them over the beauty of the things below. The invisible spirit moved him in this way, so that he would wish to administer through his own servant, whom he too used, as a hand and as a mouth and as if he were his face, (and his servant is) the things which he brings, order and threat and fear , in order that those with whom he has done what is ignorant might despise the order which was given for them to keep, since they are fettered in the bonds of the archons, which are on them securely. The whole establishment of matter is divided into three. The strong powers which the spiritual Logos brought forth from fantasy and arrogance, he established in the first spiritual rank. Then those (powers ) which these produced by their lust for power, he set in the middle area, since they are powers of ambiti on, so that they might exercise dominion and give commands with compulsion and force to the establ ishment which is beneat h them. Those which came into being through envy and jealousy, and all the other offspri ng from dispos itions of this sort, he set in a servile order control ling the extremiti es, commanding all those which exist and all (the realm of) generation , from whom come rapidly destroying illnesses, who eagerly desire begetting, who are something in the place where they are from and to which they will return. And therefor e, he appointed over them authoritative powers, acting continuousl y on matter, in order that the offspr ing of those which exist might also exist continuousl y. For this is their glory.

All those which the first ones will wish to make, so to speak, a projection of theirs, like a shadow cast from and following a body, those things which are the roots of the visible creations, namely, the entire preparation of the adornment of the images and representations and likenesses, have come into being because of those who need education and teaching and formation, so that the smallness might grow, little by little, as through a mirror image. For it was for this reason that he created manki nd at the end, having first prepared and provided for him the things which he had created for his sake. Like that of all else is the creatio n of mankind as well. The spiritua l Logos moved him invisibly, as he perfected him through the Demiurg e and his angelic servants, who shared in the act of fashioning in multitudes, when he took counsel with his archons. Like a shadow is earthly man, so that he might be like those who are cut off from the Totalities. Also he is somethi ng prepared by all of them, those of the right and those of the left, since each one in the orders gives a form to the [...] in which it exists. The [...] which the Logos who was defective brough t forth, who was in the sickness, did not resemble him, because he brought it forth forgetful ly, ignorant ly, and defect ively, and in all the other weak ways, althoug h the Logos gave the first form through the Demiurge out of ignorance, so that he would learn that the exalted one exists , and would know that he needs him. This is what the prophet called \"Living Spirit\" and \"Breath of the exalted aeons\" and \"the Invisible,\" and this is the living soul which has given life to the power which was dead at first. For that which is dead i s ignoran ce. It is fitting that we explain about the soul of the first human being, that it is from the spiritual Logos, while the creator thinks that it is his, since it is from him, as from a mouth through which one breathes. The creator also sent down souls from his substance, since he, too, has a power of procreation, because he is somethi ng which has come into being from the representation of the Father. Also those of the left brought forth, as it were, men of their own, since they have the likeness of <being>. The spiritua l substance is a single thing and a single representatio n, and its weakness is the determinat ion in many forms. As for the substance of the psych ics, its determinat ion is double, since it has the knowledge and the confession of the exalted one, and it is not inclined to evil, because of the inclination of the thought. As for the material substance, its way is different and in many forms, and it was a weakness which existed in many types of inclination. The first human being is a mixed formatio n, and a mixed creation, and a deposit of those of the left and those of the right, and a spiritual word whose attentio n is divided between each of the two substan ces from which he takes his being. Therefore, it is said that a paradise was planted for him, so that he might eat of the food of three kinds of tree, since it is a garden of the threefold order, a nd since it is that which gives enjoyment. The noble elect substan ce which is in him was more exalted. It created and it did not wound them. Theref ore they issued a comma nd, making a threat and bringing upon him a great danger, which is death. Only the enjoyment of the things which are evil did he allow him to taste, and from the other tree with the doubl e (fruit) he did not allow him to eat, much less from the tree of life, so that they would not acquire honor [...] them, and so that they would not be [...] by the evil power which is called \"the serpent.\" And he is more cunning than all the evil powers. He led man astray through the determination of those things which belong to the thoug ht and the desires. <He> made him transgress the command, so that he would die. And he was expelled from every enjoyment of that place. This is the expulsion which was made for him, when he was expelled from the enjoyment s of the things which belong to the likeness and those of the representatio n. It was a work of providence, so that it might be found that it is a short time until man will receive the enjoyment of the things which are eternall y good, in which is the place of rest. This the spirit ordained when he first planned that man should experien ce the great evil, which is death, that is complete ignorance of the Totality, and that he should experience all the evils which come from this and, after the - 5 5 -"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"depriv ations and cares which are in these, that he should receive of the greatest good, which is life eternal, that is, firm know ledge of the Totalities and the receptio n of all good things. Because of the transgression of the first man, death ruled. It was accustomed to slay every man in the manifestation of its dominat ion, which had been given it as a k ingdom because of the organization of the Father's will, of which we spoke previously. Part III 12. The Varie ty of Theologies If both the orders, those on the right and those on the left, are brought together with one another by the thought which is set between them, which gives them their organization with each other, it happens that they both act with the same emulation of their deeds, with those of the right resembling those of the left, and those of the left resembli ng those of the right. And if at times the evil order begins to do evil in a foolish way, the <wise> order emulates, in the form of a man of violence, also doing what is evil, as if it were a power of a man of violence. At other times the foolish order attempts to do good, making itself like it, since the hidde n order, too, is zealous to do it. Just as it is in the things which are established, so (it is) in the things which have come to be. Since they bring things unlike one another, those who were not instructed were unabl e to know the cause of the things which exist. Therefore, they have introd uced other types (of explanation), some saying that it is according to providence that the things which exist have their being. These are the people who observe the stability and the conformity of the move ment of creation. Others say that it is something alien. These are people who observe the diversity and the lawlessness and the evil of the powers. Others say that the things which exist are what is destined to happen. These are the people who were occup ied with this matter. Others say that it is somethi ng in accordance with nature. Others say that it is a self-existent. The majority, howe ver, all who have reached as far as the visible elements, do not know anything more than them. Those who were wise among the Greeks and the barbarians have advanced to the powers which have come into being by way of imagin ation and vain thought. Those who have come from these, in accord with the mutual conflict and rebellious manner active in them, also spoke in a likely, arrogant and imaginary way concerning the things which they thought of as wisdom, although the likeness deceiv ed them, since they thought that they had attained the truth, when they had (only) attained error. (They did so) not simply in minor appellations, but the powers themselve s seem to hinder them, as if they were the Totality. Therefor e, the order was caught up in fighting itself alone, because of the arrogant hostility of one of the offspr ing of the archo n who is superior, who exists before him. Therefore, nothing was in agreement with its fellows, nothing, neither philosoph y nor types of medicine nor types of rhetori c nor types of music nor types of logic, but they are opinions and theories. Ineffability held sway in confus ion, because of the indescribable quality of those who hold sway, who give them thoughts. Now, as for the things which came forth from the <race> of the Hebrews, things which are writte n by the hylics who speak in the fashion of the Greeks, the powers of those who think about all of them, so to speak, the \"right ones,\" the powers which move them all to think of words and a repres entation, they <brought> them, and they grasped so as to attain the truth and used the confused powers which act in them. Afterwards they attained to the order of the unmixed ones, the one which is established, the unity which exists as a representation of the representatio n of the Father. It is not invisible in its nature, but a wisdom envelops it, so that it might preserve the form of the truly invisible one. Therefor e, many angels have not been able to see it. Also, other men of the Hebrew race, of whom we already spoke, namely the righteous ones and the prophets, did not think of anything and did not say anythi ng from imagi nation or through a likeness or from esoteric thinking, but each one by the powe r which was at work in him, and while listening to the things which he saw and heard , spoke of them in [...]. They have a unified harmony with one another after the manner of those who worked in them, since they preserve the connection and the mutual harmony primar ily by the confession of the one more exalted than they. And there is one who is greater than they, who was appointed since they have need of him, and whom the spiritual - 5 6 -"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Logos begot along with them as one who needs the exalted one, in hope and expectatio n in accord with the thought which is the seed of salvat ion. And he is an illuminating word, which consists of the thought and his offspring and his emanations. Since the righteous ones and the prophets, whom we have previously mentioned, preserve the confession and the testimony concerning the one who is great, made by their fathers who were looking for the hope and the hearing, in them is sown the seed of prayer and the search ing, which is sown in many who have searched for strengthen ing. It appears and draws them to love the exalted one, to proclaim these things as pertaining to a unity. And it was a unity which worked in them when they spoke. Their vision and their words do not differ because of the multitude of those who have given them the vision and the word. Therefore, those who have listened to what they have said concerning this do not reject any of it, but have accepted the scriptures in an altered way. By interpreting them, they established many heresies which exist to the present among the Jews. Some say that God is one, who made a proclam ation in the ancient scriptures. Others say that he is many. Some say that God is simple and was a single mind in nature. Others say that his activity is linked with the establishment of good and evil. Still others say that he is the creator of that which has come into being. Still others say that it was by the angels that he created. The multitude of ideas of this sort is the multitude of forms and the abundance of types of scripture, that which produced their teachers of the Law. The prophets, however, did not say anyth ing of their own accord, but each one of them (spoke) of the things which he had seen and heard throug h the proclamation of the Savior. This is what he proclaimed , with the main subject of their proclamat ion being that which each said concerning the comin g of the Savior, which is this coming. Sometimes the prophets speak about it as if it will be. Sometimes (it is) as if the Savior speaks from their mouth s, saying that the Savior will come and show favor to those who have not known him. They have not all joined with one another in confessing anyth ing, but each one, on the basis of the thing from which he received power to speak about him, and on the basis of the place which he saw, thinks that it is from it that he will be begotten, and that he will come from that place. Not one of them knew when ce he would come nor by whom he would be begotten, but he alone is the one of whom it is worthy to speak, the one who will be begotten and will suffer. Concerning that which he previously was and that which he is eternally - an unbegotten, impassible one from the Logos, who came into being in flesh - he did not come into their thought. And this is the account which they received an impuls e to give concerning his flesh which was to appear. They say that it is a production from all of them, but that before all things it is from the spiritual Logos, who is the cause of the things which have come into being, from whom the Savior received his flesh. He had conceived <it> at the revelation of the light, according to the word of the promise, at his revelation from the seminal state. For the one who exists is not a seed of the things which exist, since he was begotten at the end. But to the one by whom the Father ordained the manifestation of salvation, who is the fulfillment of the promise, to him belonged all these instruments for entry into life, through which he descended. His Father is one, and alone is truly a father to him, the invisible, unknowable, the incomprehensible in his nature, who alone is God in his will and his form, who has gran ted that he might be seen, know n, and comprehended. 13. The Incarnate S avior and his Companion s He it is who was our Savior in willing compassion , who is that which they were. For it was for their sake that he became manifest in an involuntary suffering. They became flesh and soul, that is, eternally which (things) hold them and with corruptib le things they die. And as for those who came into being, the invisible one taught them in visibly about himself. Not only did he take upon <himself> the death of those whom he thought to save, but he also accepted their smallness to which they had descended when they were <born> in body and soul. (He did so) because he had let himse lf be conceived and born as an infant, in body and soul. Among all the others who shared in them, and those who fell and received the light, he came into being exalted, because he had let himse lf be conceived without sin, stain and defilement. He was begotten in life, being in life because the former and the latter are in passion and changing opinio n - 5 7 -"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"from the Logos who moved, who establ ished them to be body and soul. He it is <who > has taken to himself the one who came from those whom we previously mentioned. He came into being from the glorious vision and the unchanging thought of the Logos who returned to himse lf, after his movement, from the organization, just as those who came with him took body and soul and a confirmation and stability and judgment of things. They too intended to come. When they thought of the Savior they came, and they came when he knew; they also came more exalted in the emanation accordi ng to the flesh than those who had been brought forth from a defect, because in this way they, too, received their bodily emanatio n, along with the body of the Savior, through the revelation and the mingling with him. These others were those of one substance, and it indeed is the spiritual (substance). The organizat ion is different. This is one thing, that is another. Some come forth from passion and division, needing healing. Others are from prayer, so that they heal the sick, when they have been appointed to treat those who have fallen. These are the apostles and the evangel ists. They are the disciples of the Savior, and teachers who need instruct ion. Why, then, did they, too, share in the passions in which those who have been brought forth from passion share, if indeed they are bodily productions in accorda nce with the organizat ion and <the> Savior, who did not share in the passions? The Savior was an image of the unitary one, he who is the Totality in bodily form. Therefore, he preserved the form of indivisibility, from which comes impassability. They, however, are images of each thing which became manifest. Therefore, they assume division from the pattern, having taken form for the planting which exists beneath the heaven. This also is what shares in the evil which exists in the places which they have reached. For the wi ll held the Tota lity under sin, so that by that will he might have mercy on the Totality and they might be saved, while a single one alone is appointed to give life, and all the rest need salvation. Therefor e, it was from (reasons) of this sort that it began to receive grace to give the honors which were proclaimed by Jesus, which were suitable for him to proclaim to the rest, since a seed of the promise of Jesus Christ was set up, whom we have served in (his) revelat ion and union. Now the promise possessed the instru ction and the return to what they are from the first, from which they possess the drop, so as to return to him, which is that which is called \"the redemption.\" And it is the release from the captiv ity and the accepta nce of freedom . In its places, the captivity of those who were slaves of ignoran ce holds sway. The freedom is the know ledge of the truth which existed before the ignorance was ruling, forever without beginning and without end, being something good, and a salvation of things, and a release from the servile nature in which they have suffered. Those who have been brought forth in a lowly thought of vanity, that is, (a thought ) which goes to things which are evil throug h the thought which draws them down to the lust for power, these have received the possession which is freedom, from the abunda nce of the grace which looked upon the children. It was, however, a disturban ce of the passion and a destructio n of those things which he cast off from himself at first, when the Logos separated them from himself, (the Logos) who was the cause of their being destined for destruction, though he kept <them> at <the> end of the organization and allowed them to exist because even they were useful for the things which were ordained. 14. The Tripartition of Mank ind Mankind came to be in three essential types, the spiritual , the psych ic, and the material, conforming to the triple disposition of the Log os, from which were brought forth the material ones and the psych ic ones and the spiritual ones. Each of the three essential types is known by its fruit. And they were not known at first but only at the coming of the Savior, who shone upon the saints and revealed what each was. The spiritua l race, being like light from light and like spirit from spirit, when its head appeared, it ran toward him immediately . It immediately became a body of its head. It suddenly received know ledge in the revelation. The psychi c race is like light from a fire, since it hesitated to accept know ledge of him who appeared to it. (It hesitated) even more to run toward him in faith. Rather, - 5 8 -"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"through a voice it was instructed, and this was sufficient, since it is not far from the hope according to the promise, since it received, so to speak as a pledge, the assurance of the things which were to be. The material race, howev er, is alien in every way; since it is dark, it shuns the shining of the light, because its appearan ce destroys it. And since it has not received its unity, it is something exces sive and hateful toward the Lord at his revelation. The spiritua l race will receive complete salvation in every way. The material will receive destruction in every way, just as one who resists him. The psychic race, since it is in the middle when it is brought forth and also when it is created, is doubl e according to its determinat ion for both good and evil. It takes its appointed departure suddenly and its complete escape to those who are good. Those whom the Logos brought forth in accorda nce with the first element of his thought, when he remembered the exalted one and prayed for salvation, have salvati on suddenly. They will be saved completely because of the salvific though t. As he was brought forth, so, too, were these brought forth from him, whether angels or men. In accordance with the confession that there is one who is more exalted than themselv es, and in accordance with the prayer and the search for him, they also will attain the salvation of those who have been brough t forth, since they are from the disposition which is good. They were appointed for service in procla iming the coming of the Savior who was to be and his revelation which had come. Whether angels or men, when he was sent as a service to them, they received, in fact, the essence of their being. Those, howe ver, who are from the thought of lust for power, who have come into being from the blow of those who fight against him, those whom the thought brought forth, from these, since they are mixed, they will receive their end suddenly. Those who will be brought forth from the lust for power which is given to them for a time and for certain periods, and who will give glory to the Lord of glory, and who will relinquish their wrath, they will receiv e the reward for their humility, which is to remain forever. Those, howe ver, who are proud because of the desire of ambition, and who love tempo rary glory, and who forget that it was only for certain periods and times which they have that they were entrusted with power, and for this reason did not ackno wledge that the Son of God is the Lord of all and Savior, and were not brought out of wrath and the resemblance to the evil ones, they will receive judgment for their ignoran ce and their senselessness, which is suffering, along with those who went astray, anyone of them who turned away; and even more (for) wicked ness in doing to the Lord things which were not fitting, which the powers of the left did to him, even including his death . They persevered saying, \"We shall become rulers of the universe, if the one who has been proclaimed king of the universe is slain,\" (they said this) when they labored to do this, namely the men and angels who are not from the good dispositio n of the right ones but from the mixture. And they first chose for themselves honor, though it was only a temporary wish and desire, while the path to eternal rest is by way of humility for salvat ion of those who will be saved, those of the right ones. After they confess the Lord and the thought of that which is pleasi ng to the church and the song of those who are humb le along with her to the full extent possible, in that which is pleasing to do for her, in sharing in her sufferi ngs and her pains in the manner of those who understand what is good for the church, they will have a share in her hope. This is to be said on the subject of how men and angels who are from the order of the left have a path to error: not only did they deny the Lord and plot evil against him, but also toward the Church did they direct their hatred and envy and jealousy; and this is the reason for the condemnation of those who have moved and have aroused themsel ves for the trials of the Churc h. 15. The Process of Restora tion The election shares body and essence with the Savior, since it is like a bridal chamber because of its unity and its agreement with him. For, before every place, the Christ came for her sake. The calling, howev er, has the place of those who rejoice at the bridal chamber, and who are glad and happy at the union of the bridegr oom and the bride. The place which the calling will have is the aeon of the images, where the Logos has not yet joined with the Pleroma. And since the man of the Churc h was happy and glad at this, as he was hoping for it, he separated spirit, soul, and body in the organization of the one who thinks that he is a unity, though within him is the man who is the - 5 9 -"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Totality - and he is all of them. And, though he has the escape from the [...] which the places will receive, he also has the members about which we spoke earlier. When the redemption was proclaimed, the perfect man received know ledge immediately, so as to return in haste to his unitary state, to the place from which he came, to return there joyfully, to the place from which he came, to the place from which he flowed forth. His memb ers, howev er, needed a place of instruction, which is in the places which are adorned, so that they might receiv e from them resemblance to the images and archetypes, like a mirror , until all the members of the body of the Churc h are in a single place and receive the restoration at one time, when they have been manifested as the whole body, namely the restoration into the Pleroma. It has a preliminary concord with a mutual agreement, which is the concord which belongs to the Father, until the Totaliti es receive a countenan ce in accordance with him. The restoration is at the end, after the Totality reveals what it is, the Son, who is the redemption, that is, the path toward the incompre hensible Father, that is, the return to the pre-existent, and (after) the Totalit ies reveal themse lves in that one, in the proper way, who is the inconceivable one and the ineffable one, and the invisible one and the incompre hensible one, so that it receives redemption. It was not only release from the domina tion of the left ones, nor was it only escape from the powe r of those of the right, to each of which we thought that were slaves and sons, from whom none escapes without quickly becomi ng theirs again, but the redemption also is an ascent to the degrees which are in the Pleroma and to those who have named themselv es and who conceive of themsel ves accordi ng to the power of each of the aeons, and (it is) an entranc e into what is silent, where there is no need for voice nor for knowing, nor for formi ng a concept, nor for illumination, but (where ) all things are light, while they do not need to be illumined. Not only do humans need redemption, but also the angels, too, need redemption, along with the image and the rest of the Pleromas of the aeons and the wondrous powers of illumination. So that we might not be in doubt in regard to the others, even the Son himse lf, who has the position of redee mer of the Totality, needed redemption as well, - he who had become man, - since he gave himse lf for each thing which we need, we in the flesh, who are his Church. Now, when he first received redemption from the word which had descended upon him, all the rest received redemption from him, namely those who had taken him to themselves. For those who received the one who had received (redemptio n) also received what was in him. Among the men who are in the flesh redemption began to be given, his first-born, and his love, the Son who was incarnate, while the angels who are in heaven asked to associate, so that they might form an associatio n with him upon the earth. Therefore, he is called \"the Redemption of the angels of the Father,\" he who comforted those who were laboring under the Totality for his know ledge, because he was given the grace before anyone else. The Father had foreknow ledge of him, since he was in his thoug ht before anything came into being, and since he had those to whom he has revealed him. He set the deficiency on the one who remains for certain periods and times, as a glory for his Pleroma, since the fact that he is unknown is a cause of his production from his agreement [...] of him. Just as reception of knowledge of him is a manifestation of his lack of envy and the revelat ion of the abundance of his sweetness, which is the second glory, so, too, he has been found to be a cause of ignorance, although he is also a begetter of knowledge. In a hidden and incompre hensible wisdom he kept the knowledge to the end, until the Totalit ies became weary while searching for God the Father, whom no one found through his own wisdom or power. He gives himsel f, so that they might receive knowl edge of the abundant thought about his great glory, which he has given, and (about) the cause, which he has given, which is his unceasing thanksgiving, he who, from the immobi lity of his counse l, reveals himself eternal ly to those who have been worthy of the Father, who is unknown in his nature, so that they might receive knowl edge of him, through his desire that they should come to experience the ignorance and its pains. Those of whom he first thought that they should attain knowledge and the good things which are in it, they were planning - which is the wisdom of the Father, - that they might experience the evil things and might train themselves in them, as a [...] for a time, so that they might receiv e the - 6 0 -"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"enjoyment of good things for eternity. They hold change and persistent renunciation and the cause of those who fight against them as an adornment and marvelous quality of those who are exalted, so that it is manifest that the ignorance of those who will be ignora nt of the Father was something of their own. He who gave them know ledge of him was one of his powers for enabling them to grasp that knowledge in the fullest sense is called \"the knowledge of all that which is thought of\" and \"the treasure\" and \"the addition for the increase of knowledge,\" \"the revelation of those things which were known at first,\" and \"the path toward harmony and toward the pre-existent one,\" which is the increase of those who have abando ned the greatness which was theirs in the organ ization of the will, so that the end might be like the beginning. As for the baptism which exists in the fullest sense, into which the Totalities will descend and in which they will be, there is no other baptism apart from this one alone, which is the redemption into God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, when confession is made through faith in those names, which are a single name of the gospel, when they have come to believe what has been said to them, namely that they exist. From this they have their salvat ion, those who have believed that they exist. This is attaining in an invisible way to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in an undoubti ng faith. And when they have borne witness to them, it is also with a firm hope that they attained them, so that the return to them might become the perfect ion of those who have believed in them and (so that) the Father might be one with them, the Father, the God, whom they have confessed in faith and who gave (them ) their union with him in knowl edge. The baptism which we previously mentioned is called \"garment of those who do not strip themse lves of it,\" for those who will put it on and those who have received redemption wear it. It is also called \"the confirmation of the truth which has no fall.\" In an unwa vering and immovable way it grasps those who have received the restoration while they grasp it. (Baptism) is called \"silence\" because of the quiet and the tranquility. It is also called \"bridal cham ber\" because of the agreement and the indivisible state of those who know they have know n him. It is also called \"the light which does not set and is without flame,\" since it does not give light, but those who have worn it are made into light. They are the ones whom he wore. (Baptism) is also called \"the eternal life,\" which is immortal ity; and it is called \"that which is, entirely, simply, in the proper sense, what is pleasing, inseparably and irremova bly and faultless ly and imperturbably, for the one who exists for those who have received a beginning.\" For, what else is there to name it apart from \"God,\" since it is the Totaliti es, that is, even if it is given numberless names, they are spoken simply as a reference to it. Just as he transcends every word, and he transcends every voice, and he transce nds every mind, and he transcends everything, and he transcends every silence, so it is Dittography with those who are that which he is. This is that which they find it to be, ineffably and inconceivably in (its) visage, for the coming into being in those who know, through him whom they have comprehended, who is the one to whom they gave glory. 16. Redemp tion of the Ca lling Even if on the matter of the election there are many more things for us to say, as it is fitting to say, noneth eless, on the matter of those of the calling - for those of the right are so named - it is necessary for us to return once again to them, and it is not profitable for us to forget them. We have spoken about them, - If there is enough in what preceded at some length, how have we spoken? In a partial way, - since I said about all those who came forth from the Logos, either from the judgment of the evil ones or from the wrath which fights against them and the turning away from them, which is the return to the exalte d ones, or from the prayer and the rememb rance of those who pre-existed, or from hope and faith that they would receiv e their salvation from good work, since they have been deemed worth y because they are beings from the good dispositions, (that) they have cause of their begetting which is an opinion from the one who exists. Still further (I said) that before the Logos concerned himself with them in an invisible way, willingly, the exalted one added to this though t, because they were in need of him, who was the cause of their being. They did not exalt themselves when they were saved, as if there were nothing existing before them, but they confess that they have a beginning to their existenc e, and they desire this: to - 6 1 -"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"know him who exists before them. Most of all (I said) that they worshipp ed the revelatio n of the light in the form of lightning, and they bore wit ness that it appeared as <their> salvat ion. Not only those who have come forth from the Logos, about whom alone we said that they would accomplish the good work, but also those whom these brought forth accordi ng to the good dispositions will share in the repose accord ing to the abundance of the grace. Also those who have been brought forth from the desire of lust for powe r, having the seed in them which is the lust for power, will receive the reward for (their) good deeds, namely those who acted and those who have the predisposit ion toward the good, if they intent ionally desire and wish to abandon the vain, tempo ral ambition, and they keep the comma ndment of the Lord of glory, instead of the momentar y honor, and inherit the eternal kingdom. Now, it is necessary that we unite the causes and the effects on them of the grace and the impulses, since it is fitting that we say what we mentio ned previously about the salvation of all those of the right, of all those unmixed and those mixed, to join them with one another. And as for the repose, which is the revelation of the form <in> which they believed, (it is necessary ) that we should treat it with a suitable discussion. For when we confessed the kingdom which is in Christ, <we> escaped from the whole multip licity of forms, and from inequality and change. For the end will receive a unitar y existence, just as the beginning is unitary, where there is no male nor female, nor slave and free, nor circumcision and uncircumcision, neither angel nor man, but Christ is all in all. What is the form of the one who did not exist at first? It will be found that he will exist. And what is the nature of the one who was a slave? He will take a place with a free man. For they will receive the vision more and more by nature and not only by a little word, so as to believe, only through a voice, that this is the way it is, that the restoration to that which used to be is a unity. Even if some are exalted because of the organization, since they have been appoi nted as causes of the things which have come into being, since they are more active as natural forces, and since they are desired because of these things, angels and men wi ll receiv e the kingdom and the confirmation and the salvat ion. These, then, are the causes . About the <one> who appea red in flesh, they believed without any doubt that he is the Son of the unknow n God, who was not previously spoken of, and who could not be seen. They abando ned their gods whom they had previous ly worshippe d, and the lords who are in heaven and on earth. Before he had taken them up, and while he was still a child, they testified that he had already begun to preac h. And when he was in the tomb as a dead man the angels thought that he was alive, receiv ing life from the one who had died. They first desired their numerous services and wonders, which were in the temple on their behalf, to be performed continuousl y <as> the confession. That is, it can be done on their behalf through their approach to him. That preparation which they did not accept, they rejected, because of the one who had not been sent from that place, but they granted to Christ, of whom they thought that he exists in that place from which they had come along with him, a place of gods and lords whom they served, worshipped, and ministered to, in the names which they had received on loan. - They were given to the one who is designated by them properly. - Howe ver, after his assumption, they had the experience to know that he is their Lord, over whom no one else is lord. They gave him their kingdom s; they rose from their thrones; they were kept from their crowns.

Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library , revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francis co, 1990. The teaching of the savior, and the revelat ion of the mysteries and the things hidden in silence, even these things which he taught John, his disciple. And it happened one day, when John, the brother of James - who are the sons of Zebedee - had come up to the temple, that a Pharisee named Arimanius approached him and said to him, \"Where is your maste r whom you followed?\" And he said to him, \"He has gone to the place from which he came.\" The Pharisee said to him, \"With deception did this Nazarene deceive you (pl.), and he filled your e ars with lies, and closed your hearts (and) turned you fr om the traditions of your fa thers.\" When I, John, heard these things I turned away from the temple to a desert place. And I grieved greatly in my heart, saying, \"How then was the savior appointed, and why was he sent into the world by his Father, and who is his Father who sent him, and of what sort is that aeon to which we shall go? For what did he mean when he said to us, 'This aeon to which you will go is of the type of the imperis hable aeon, but he did not teach us conce rning the latter, of what sort it is.\" Straightway, while I was contemp lating these things, behold, the heave ns opened and the whole creation which is below heaven shone, and the world was shaken. I was afraid, and behold I saw in the light a youth who stood by me. While I looked at him, he became like an old man. And he changed his likeness (again ), becoming like a servant. There was not a plurality before me, but there was a likeness with multiple forms in the light, and the likenesses appeared through each other, and the likenes s had three forms. He said to me, \"John, John, why do you doubt, or why are you afraid ? You are not unfamiliar with this image, are you? - that is, do not be timid! - I am the one who is with you (pl.) always. I am the Father, I am the Mother, I am the Son. I am the undefiled and incorruptible one. Now I have come to teach you what is and what was and what will come to pass, that you may know the things which are not revealed and those which are revealed, and to teach you concerning the unwa vering race of the perfect Man. Now, therefor e, lift up your face, that you may receive the things that I shall teach you today, and may tell them to your fellow spirits who are from the unwa vering race of the perfect Man.\" And I asked to know it, and he said to me, \"The Monad is a monarchy with nothing above it. It is he who exists as God and Father of everything, the invisible One who is above everything, who exists as incorrupt ion, which is in the pure light into which no eye can look. \"He is the invisible Spirit, of whom it is not right to think of him as a god, or somethi ng similar. For he is more than a god, since there is nothing above him, for no one lords it over him. For he does not exist in somethi ng inferior to him, since everythi ng exists in him. For it is he who establishes himsel f. He is eternal, since he does not need anything. For he is total perfect ion. He did not lack anyth ing, that he might be completed by it; rather he is always completely perfect in light. He is illimitable, since there is no one prior to him to set limits to him. He is unsearchable, since there exists no one prior to him to examine him. He is immeasurab le, since there was no one prior to him to measure him. He is invisible, since no one saw him. He is eterna l, since he exists eternally. He is ineffable, since no one was able to compr ehend him to speak about him. He is unnam eable, since there is no one prior to him to give him a name. \"He is immeasurabl e light, which is pure, holy (and) imma culate. He is ineffable, being perfect in incorrupti bility. (He is) not in perfect ion, nor in blessed ness, nor in divinity, but he is far superior. He is not corporeal nor is he incorporea l. He is neither large nor is he small. There is no way to say, 'What is his quantity?' or, 'What is his quality?', for no one can know him. He is not someone among (other) beings, rather he is far superior. Not that he is (simply) superior, but his essence does not partake in the aeons nor in time. For he who partakes in an aeon was prepar ed - 6 4 -"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"before hand. Time was not appor tioned to him, since he does not receive anything from another, for it would be received on loan. For he who precedes someone does not lack, that he may receive from him. For rather, it is the latter that looks expectantly at him in his light. \"For the perfect ion is majestic. He is pure, immeasurable mind. He is an aeon- giving aeon. He is life-giving life. He is a blessedness-giving blessed one. He is knowled ge-giving knowledge. He is goodness- giving goodness. He is mercy and redemption- giving mercy. He is grace- giving grace, not because he possesses it, but because he gives the immeasurab le, incompre hensible light. \"How am I to speak with you about him? His aeon is indestructible, at rest and existing in silence , repos ing (and) being prior to everythi ng. For he is the head of all the aeons, and it is he who gives them strength in his goodness. For we know not the ineffable things, and we do not understand what is immeasurabl e, except for him who came forth from him, namely (from) the Father. For it is he who told it to us alone. For it is he who looks at himse lf in his light which surrounds him, namely the spring of the water of life. And it is he who gives to all the aeons and in every way, (and) who gazes upon his image which he sees in the spring of the Spirit. It is he who puts his desire in his water- light which is in the spring of the pure l ight-water which surround s him. \"And his thoug ht performed a deed and she came forth, namely she who had appear ed before him in the shine of his light. This is the first power which was before all of them (and) which came forth from his mind, She is the forethoug ht of the All - her light shines like his light - the perfect power which is the image of the invisible, virginal Spirit who is perfect. The first powe r, the glory of Barbelo, the perfect glory in the aeons, the glory of the revelation, she glorified the virginal Spirit and it was she who praised him, because thanks to him she had come forth. This is the first thought, his image; she became the womb of everyth ing, for it is she who is prior to them all, the Mother-Father, the first man, the holy Spirit, the thrice -male, the thrice-powerful, the thrice- named androgynous one, and the eternal aeon among the invisible ones, and the first to come forth. \"<She> requested from the invisible, virginal Spirit - that is Barbelo - to give her foreknow ledge. And the Spirit conse nted. And when he had consented, the foreknowledge came forth, and it stood by the forethought; it originates from the thought of the invisible, virginal Spirit. It glorified him and his perfect power, Barbelo, for it was for her sake that it had come into being. \"And she requested again to grant her indestructibility, and he consented. When he had consented, indestru ctibility came forth, and it stood by the thoug ht and the forekno wledge.

These are the four lights which attend the divine Autoge nes, (and) these are the twelv e aeons which attend the son of the mighty one, the Autogen es, the Christ, through the will and the gift of the invisible Spirit.

And she surrounded it with a luminou s cloud, and she placed a throne in the middle of the cloud that no one might see it except the holy Spirit who is called the mother of the living. And she called his name Yaltabaot h. \"This is the first archon who took a great power from his mother. And he removed himself from her and move d away from the places in which he was born. He became strong and created for himse lf other aeons with a flame of luminous fire which (still) exists now. And he joined with his arrogance which is in him and begot authorit ies for himself.

And he shared his fire with them, but he did not send forth from the power of the light which he had taken from his mother, for he is ignorant darkness. \"And when the light had mixed with the darkness, it caused the darkness to shine. And when the darkness had mixed with the light, it darkened the light and it became neither light nor dark, but it became dim. \"Now the archon who is weak has three names.

And he did not obey the place from which he came. And he united the seven powers in his thoug ht with the author ities which were with him. And when he spoke it happened.

And when they recog nized that he was luminous, and that he could think better than they, and that he was free from wic kedness, they took him and threw him into the lowest region of all matter. \"But the blessed One, the Mother- Father, the beneficent and merci ful One, had mercy on the power of the mother which had been brought forth out of the chief archo n, for they (the archon s) might gain power over the natural and percepti ble body.

And his thinking was superior to all those who had made him. When they looked up, they saw that his thinking was superior. And they took counsel with the whole array of archon s and angels. They took fire and earth and water and mixed them together with the four fiery winds. And they wrought them together and caused a great disturbance. And they brought him (Adam) into the shadow of death, in order that they might form (him) again from earth and water and fire and the spirit which originates in matter, which is the ignora nce of darkness and desire, and their counterfeit spirit. This is the tomb of the newly-formed body with which the robbers had clothed the man, the bond of forgetfulness; and he became a morta l man. This is the first one who came down, and the first separation. But the Epinoia of the light which was in him, she is the one who was to awaken his thinking. \"And the archons took him and placed him in paradise. And they said to him, 'Eat, that is at leisure, ' for their luxury is bitter and their beauty is depra ved. And their luxury is deception and their trees are godlessness and their fruit is deadly poison and their promise is death. And the tree of their life they had placed in the midst of paradise. \"And I shall teach you (pl.) what is the mystery of their life, which is the plan which they made together, which is the likeness of their spirit. The root of this (tree) is bitter and its branches are death, its shadow is hate and deceptio n is in its leaves, and its blossom is the ointment of evil, and its fruit is death and desire is its seed, and it sprouts in darkness. The dwelling place of those who taste from it is Hades, and the darkness is their place of rest. \"But what they call the tree of know ledge of good and evil, which is the Epino ia of the light, they stayed in front of it in order that he (Adam) might not look up to his fullness and recog nize the nakedn ess of his shamefulness.

Isenberg Selection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library , revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francis co, 1990. A Hebrew makes another Hebrew, and such a person is called \"proselyte\". But a proselyte does not make another proselyte. [...] just as they [...] and make others like themselves, while others simply exist. The slave seeks only to be free, but he does not hope to acquire the estate of his master. But the son is not only a son but lays claim to the inheritance of the father. Those who are heirs to the dead are themse lves dead, and they inherit the dead. Those who are heirs to what is living are alive, and they are heirs to both what is living and the dead. The dead are heirs to nothing. For how can he who is dead inherit? If he who is dead inherits what is living he will not die, but he who is dead will live even more. A Gentile does not die, for he has never lived in order that he may die. He who has believed in the truth has found life, and this one is in danger of dying, for he is alive. Since Christ came, the world has been created, the cities adorned, the dead carried out. When we were Hebrews, we were orphan s and had only our mother, but when we became Christi ans, we had both father and mother. Those who sow in winter reap in summer. The winter is the world, the summer the other Aeon (eterna l realm). Let us sow in the world that we may reap in the summer. Because of this, it is fitting for us not to pray in the winter. Summer follows winter. But if any man reap in winter he will not actually reap but only pluck out, since it will not provide a harvest for such a person. It is not only [...] that it will [...] come forth, but also on the Sabbath [...] is barren. Christ came to ransom some, to save others, to redeem others. He ransomed those who were strangers and made them his own. And he set his own apart, those whom he gave as a pledge according to his plan. It was not only when he appear ed that he voluntar ily laid down his life, but he voluntarily laid down his life from the very day the world came into being. Then he came first in order to take it, since it had been given as a pledge. It fell into the hands of robbers and was taken capti ve, but he saved it. He redeemed the good people in the world as well as the evil. Light and Darkness, life and death, right and left, are brothers of one another. They are inseparable. Because of this neither are the good good, nor evil evil, nor is life life, nor death death . For this reason each one will dissolve into its earliest origin. But those who are exalted above the world are ind issoluble, eternal. Names given to the worldly are very deceptiv e, for they divert our thoughts from what is correct to what is incorrect. Thus one who hears the word \"God\" does not perceive what is correct, but perceives what is incorre ct. So also with \"the Father\" and \"the Son\" and \"the Holy Spirit\" and \"life\" and \"light\" and \"resurrectio n\" and \"the Churc h (Ekkles ia)\" and all the rest - people do not perceive what is correct but they perceive what is incorrect, unless they have come to know what is correct. The names which are heard are in the world [...] deceive. If they were in the Aeon (eterna l realm), they would at no time be used as names in the world. Nor were they set among worldly things. They have an end in the Aeon. One single name is not uttered in the world, the name which the Father gave to the Son; it is the name above all things: the name of the Father. For the Son would not become Father unless he wore the name of the Father. Those who have this name know it, but they do not speak it. But those who do not have it do not know it. But truth brought names into existen ce in the world for our sakes, because it is not possibl e to learn it (truth) without these names. Truth is one single thing; it is many things and for our sakes to teach about this one thing in love through many things.

And afterward, what a favor they do for them! They make them be removed from those that are not good and place them among those that are good. These things they knew, for they wanted to take the free man and make him a slave to them forever. These are powers which [...] man, not wishing him to be saved, in order that they may [...]. For if man is saved, there will not be any sacrifices [...] and animal s will not be offered to the powers. Indeed, the animals were the ones to whom they sacrificed. They were indeed offering them up alive, but when they offered them up, they died. As for man, they offered him up to God dead, and he lived. Before Christ came, there was no bread in the world, just as Paradise, the place were Adam was, had many trees to nourish the anima ls but no wheat to sustain man. Man used to feed like the animal s, but when Christ came, the perfect man, he brought bread from heaven in order that man might be nouris hed with the food of man. The rulers thought that it was by their own power and will that they were doing what they did, but the Holy Spirit in secret was accomplishing everything through them as it wished. Truth, which existed since the beginning, is sown everywhere. And many see it being sown, but few are they who see it being reaped. Some said, \"Mary conceived by the Holy Spirit.\" They are in error. They do not know what they are saying. When did a woman ever conceive by a woman? Mary is the virgin whom no power defiled. She is a great anathema to the Hebrews, who are the apostles and the apostolic men. This virgin whom no power defiled [...] the powe rs defile themse lves. And the Lord would not have said \"My Father who is in Heaven\" (Mt 16:17), unless he had had another father, but he would have said s imply \"My father\". The Lord said to the disciples, \"[...] from every house. Bring into the house of the Father. But do not take (anyt hing) in the house of the Father nor carry it off.\" \"Jesus\" is a hidden name, \"Christ\" is a revealed name. For this reason \"Jesus\" is not particu lar to any langua ge; rather he is always called by the name \"Jesus\" . While as for \"Christ\", in Syriac it is \"Messiah\", in Greek it is \"Christ\". Certainly all the others have it according to their own langua ge. \"The Nazarene\" is he who reveals what is hidden. Christ has everythi ng in himself, whether man, or angel, or mystery, and the Father. Those who say that the Lord died first and (then) rose up are in error, for he rose up first and (then) died. If one does not first attain the resurrection, he will not die. As God lives, he woul d [...]. No one will hide a large valuable object in somethi ng large, but many a time one has tossed countless thousands into a thing worth a penny. Compa re the soul. It is a precious thing and it came to be in a contempti ble body. Some are afraid lest they rise naked. Because of this they wish to rise in the flesh, and they do not know that it is those who wear the flesh who are naked. It is those who [...] to unc lothe themsel ves who are not naked. \"Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God\" (1 Co 15:50). What is this which will not inherit? This which is on us. But what is this, too, which will inherit? It is that which belongs to Jesus and his blood. Because of this he said \"He who shall not eat my flesh and drink my blood has not life in him\" (Jn 6:53). What is it? His flesh is the word, and his blood is the Holy Spirit. He who has receiv ed these has food and he has drink and clothing. I find fault with the others who say that it will not rise. Then both of them are at fault. You say that the flesh will not rise. But tell me what will rise, that we may honor you. You say the Spirit in the flesh, and it is also this light in the flesh. (But) this too is a matter which is in the flesh, for whate ver you shall say, you say nothing outside the flesh. It is necessary to rise in this flesh, since everythi ng exists in it. In this world, those who put on garments are better than the garments. In the Kingdom of Heaven, the garments are better than those that put them on. It is through water and fire that the whole place is purified - the visible by the visible, the hidden by the hidden. There are some things hidden through those visible. There is water in water, there is fire in chrism. - 1 0 3 -"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Jesus took them all by stealth, for he did not appear as he was, but in the manner in which they would be able to see him. He appeared to them all. He appear ed to the great a s great. He appeared to the small as small. He appeared to the angels as an angel, and to men as a man. Because of this, his word hid itself from everyone. Some indeed saw him, thinking that they were seeing themse lves, but when he appeared to his disciples in glory on the moun t, he was not small. He became great, but he made the disciples great, that they might be able to see him in his greatness. He said on that day in the thanksg iving, \"You who have joined the perfect light with the Holy Spirit, unite the angels with us also, as being the images.\" Do not despise the lamb, for without it, it is not pos sible to see the king. No one will be able to go in to the king if he is naked. The heaven ly man has many more sons than the earthly man. If the sons of Adam are many, althoug h they die, how much more the sons of the perfect man, they who do not die but are always begotten. The father makes a son, and the son has not the powe r to mak e a son. For he who has been begotten has not the power to beget, but the son gets brothers for himse lf, not sons. All who are begotten in the world are begotten in a natural way, and the others are nourish ed from the place when ce they have been born. It is from being promised to the heaven ly place that man receives nourishme nt. [...] him from the mouth. And had the word gone out from that place, it would be nouris hed from the mouth and it would become perfect. For it is by a kiss that the perfect conce ive and give birth. For this reason we also kiss one another. We receive conception from the grace which is in one another. There were three who always walked with the Lord: Mary, his mother, and her sister, and Magdalen e, the one who was called his compan ion. His sister and his mother and his companio n were each a Mary. \"The Father\" and \"the Son\" are single names; \"the Holy Spirit\" is a double name. For they are everywhere: they are above, they are below; they are in the concealed, they are in the revealed. The Holy Spirit is in the revealed: it is below. It is in the concealed: it is above. The saints are served by evil powers, for they are blinded by the Holy Spirit into thinking that they are serving an (ordinary) man whenever they do so for the saints. Because of this, a disciple asked the Lord one day for somethin g of this world. He said to him, \"Ask your mother, and she will give you of the things which are another's.\" The apostl es said to the discip les, \"May our entire offering obtain salt.\" They called Sophia \"salt\". Without it, no offering is acceptable. But Sophia is barren, without child. For this reason, she is called \"a trace of salt\". Wherever they will [...] in their own way, the Holy Spirit [...], and her children are many. What the father possesses belongs to the son, and the son himself, so long as he is small, is not entruste d with what is his. But w hen he becomes a man , his father gives him all that he posse sses. Those who have gone astray, whom the spirit begets, usually go astray also because of the Spirit. Thus, by one and the same breath, the fire blazes and is put out. Echamoth is one thing and Echmoth, another. Echamoth is Wisdom simply, but Echmoth is the Wisdom of death, which is the one who knows death, which is called \"the little Wisdom\". There are domestic animals, like the bull and the ass and others of this kind. Others are wild and live apart in the deserts. Man ploughs the field by means of the domestic animals, and from this he is nourished, he and the animals, whether tame or wild. Compare the perfect man. It is through powers which are submissive that he ploughs, preparing for everythi ng to come into being. For it is because of this that the whole place stands, whether the good or the evil, the right and the left. The Holy Spirit shepherds everyone and rules all the powers, the \"tame\" ones and the \"wild\" ones, as well as those which are unique. For indeed he [...] shuts them in, in order that [...] wish, they will not be able to escape. He who has been created is beauti ful, but you would <not> find his sons noble creations. If he were not created, but begotten, you would find that his seed was noble. But now he was created (and) he begot. What nobility is this? First, adultery came into being, afterward murder. And he was begotten in adultery, for he was the child of the Serpent. So he became a murderer, just like - 1 0 4 -"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"his father, and he killed his brother. Indeed, every act of sexual intercourse which has occurred betwee n those unlike one another is adultery. God is a dyer. As the good dyes, which are called \"true\", dissolve with the things dyed in them, so it is with those whom God has dyed. Since his dyes are immortal, they become immortal by means of his colors. Now God dips what he dips in water. It is not possib le for anyon e to see anything of the things that actual ly exist unless he becomes like them. This is not the way with man in the world: he sees the sun without being a sun; and he sees the heaven and the earth and all other things, but he is not these things. This is quite in keeping with the truth. But you saw somethi ng of that place, and you became those things. You saw the Spirit, you became spirit. You saw Christ, you became Christ.

Faith receives, love gives. No one will be able to receive without faith. No one will be able to give without love. Because of this, in order that we may indeed receiv e, we believe, and in order that we may love, we give, since if one gives without love, he has no profit from what he has given. He who has receiv ed somethi ng other than the Lord is still a Hebrew. The apostles who were before us had these names for him: \"Jesus, the Nazorean, Messiah \", that is, \"Jesus, the Nazorean, the Christ\". The last name is \"Christ\", the first is \"Jesus\", that in the middle is \"the Nazarene\". \"Messiah\" has two meanings, both \"the Christ\" and \"the measured\". \"Jesus\" in Hebrew is \"the redemption\". \"Nazara\" is \"the Truth\". \"The Nazarene\" then, is \"the Truth\". \"Christ\" [...] has been measured. \"The Nazarene\" and \"J esus\" are they who have been measured. When the pearl is cast down into the mud, it becomes greatly despised, nor if it is anointed with balsam oil will it become more precious. But it always has value in the eyes of its owner. Compare the Sons of God: wherever they may be, they still have value in the eyes of their Father. If you say, \"I am a Jew,\" no one will be moved. If you say, \"I am a Roman,\" no one will be disturbed. If you say, \"I am a Greek, a barbar ian, a slave, a free man,\" no one will be troubled. If you say, \"I am a Christian,\" the [...] will tremb le. Would that I might [...] like that - the person whose name [ ...] will not be able to endure hear ing. God is a man- eater. For this reason, men are sacrificed to him. Before men were sacrificed, animals were being sacrificed, since those to whom they were sacrificed were not gods. Glass decanters and earthenware jugs are both made by means of fire. But if glass decanters break, they are done over, for they came into being through a breath. If earthenw are jugs break, howev er, they are destroyed, for they came into being without breath. An ass which turns a millstone did a hundred miles walking. When it was loosed, it found that it was still at the same place. There are men who make many journeys, but make no progress towards any destination. When evening came upon them, they saw neither city nor village, neither human artifact nor natural phenomeno n, powe r nor angel. In vain have the wretches labored. The euchar ist is Jesus. For he is called in Syriac \"Phari satha,\" which is \"the one who is spread out,\" for Jesus came to crucify the w orld. The Lord went into the dye works of Levi. He took seventy-two different colors and threw them into the vat. He took them out all white. And he said, \"Even so has the Son of Man come as a dyer.\" As for the Wisdom who is called \"the barren,\" she is the mother of the angels. And the compan ion of the [...] Mary Magdalene. [...] loved her more than all the disciples, and used to kiss her often on her mouth . The rest of the disciples [...]. They said to him \"Why do you love her more than all of us?\" The Savior answered and said to them, \"Why do I not love you like her? When a blind man and one who sees are both together in darkness, they are no different from one another. When the light comes, then he who sees will see the light, and he who is blind will remain in darkness.\" The Lord said, \"Blessed is he who is before he came into being. For he who is, has been and shall be.\" - 1 0 5 -"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The superiority of man is not obvious to the eye, but lies in what is hidden from view. Conse quently, he has mastery over the animals which are stronger than he is and great in terms of the obvious and the hidde n. This enables them to survive. But if man is separated from them, they slay one another and bite one another. They ate one another because they did not find any food. But now they have found food because man tilled the soil. If one goes down into the water and comes up without having received anythi ng, and says \"I am a Christi an,\" he has borrowed the name at interest. But if he receives the Holy Spirit, he has the name as a gift. He who has received a gift does not have to give it back, but of him who has borrowed it at interest, payment is demanded. This is the way it happens to one when he experiences a mystery. Great is the mystery of marriage! For without it, the world would not exist.

The forms of evil spirit include male ones and female ones.

And none shall be able to escape them, since they detain him if he does not receiv e a male powe r or a female powe r, the bridegroom and the bride. One receives them from the mirrored bridal chamber. When the wanton women see a male sitting alone, they leap down on him and play with him and defile him. So also the lecherous men, when they see a beautiful woman sitting alone, they persuade her and compel her, wishing to defile her. But if they see the man and his wife sitting beside one another, the female cannot come into the man, nor can the male come into the woma n. So if the image and the angel are united with one another, neither can any venture to go i nto the m an or the woman.

And so he dwells either in this world or in the resurrection or in the middle place. God forbid that I be found in there! In this world, there is good and evil. Its good things are not good, and its evil things not evil. But there is evil after this world which is truly evil - what is called \"the middle\". It is death. While we are in this world, it is fitting for us to acquire the resurrection, so that when we strip off the flesh, we may be found in rest and not walk in the middle. For many go astray on the way. For it is good to come forth from the world before one has sinned. There are some who neither will nor have the power to; and others who, if they will, do not profit; for they did not act since [...] makes them sinners.

I am not referring to that fire which has no form, but to the other fire whose form is white, which is bright and beautiful, and which gives beauty. Truth did not come into the world naked, but it came in types and images. The world will not receive truth in any other way. There is a rebirth and an image of rebirth. It is certainly necessary to be born again through the image. Which one? Resurrection. The image must rise again through the image. The bridal chamber and the image must enter through the image into the truth: this is the restoration.

This power the apostles called \"the right and the left.\" For this person is no longer a Christi an but a Christ. The Lord did everyth ing in a mystery, a baptism and a chrism and a eucharist and a redemption and a bridal cham ber. [...] he said, \"I came to make the things below like the things above, and the things outside like those inside. I came to unite them in the place.\" [...] here throug h types [...]an d images. Those who say, \"There is a heave nly man and there is one above him\" are wrong. For it is the first of these two heaven ly men, the one who is reveale d, that they call \"the one who is below\"; and he to whom the hidden belongs is that one who is above him. For it would be better for them to say, \"The inner and outer, and what is outside the outer\". Because of this, the Lord called destruct ion the \"the outer darkness\": there is not another outside of it. He said, \"My Father who is in secret\". He said, \"Go into your cham ber and shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father who is in secret\" (Mt 6:6), the one who is within them all. But that which is within them all is the fullness. Beyond it, there is nothing else within it. This is that of which they say, \"That which is above them\". Before Christ, some came from a place they were no longer able to enter, and they went where they were no longer able to come out. Then Christ came. Those who went in, he brought out, and those who went out, h e brought in. When Eve was still with Adam, death did not exist. When she was separated from him, death came into being. If he enters again and attains his former self, death will be no more. \"My God, my God, why, O Lord, have you forsak en me?\" (Mk 15:34). It was on the cross that he said these words, for he had departed from that place . [...] who has been begotten through him who [...] from Go d. The [...] from the dead.

A bridal chamber is not for the animals, nor is it for the slaves, nor for defiled women; but it is for free men and virgins. Throug h the Holy Spirit we are indeed begotten again, but we are begotten through Christ in the two. We are anoin ted through the Spirit. When we were begotten, we were united. None can see himse lf either in water or in a mirror without light. Nor again can you see in light without mirror or water. For this reason, it is fitting to baptize in the two, in the light and the water. Now the light is the chr ism. There were three buildings specifically for sacrifice in Jerusalem. The one facing the west was called \"The Holy\". Another, facing south, was called \"The Holy of the Holy\". The third, facing east, was called \"The Holy of the Holies\", the place where only the high priest enters. Baptism is \"the Holy\" building. Redemption is the \"Holy of the Holy\". \"The Holy of the Holies\" is the bridal chamber. Baptism includes the resurrection and the redemption; the redemption (takes place) in the bridal chamber. But the bridal cham ber is in that which is superior to [...] you will not find [...] are those who pray [...] Jerusale m who [...] Jerusalem, [...] those called the \"Holy of the Holies\" [...] the veil was rent, [...] bridal chamber except the image [...] above. Because of this, its veil was rent from top to bottom. For it was fitting for some fr om below to go upw ard. The powers do not see those who are clothed in the perfect light, and conseq uently are not able to detain them. One will clothe himse lf in this light sacramenta lly in the union. If the woman had not separated from the man, she should not die with the man. His separation became the beginning of death. Because of this, Christ came to repair the separation, which was from the beginning, and again unite the two, and to give life to those who died as a result of the separation, and unite them. But the woman is united to her husban d in the bridal cham ber. Indeed, those who have united in the bridal chamber will no longer be separated. Thus Eve separated from Adam because it was not in the bridal chamber that she united with him. - 1 0 7 -"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The soul of Adam came into being by means of a breath.

Jesus appeared [...] Jordan - the fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven. He who was begotten before everything, was begotten anew. He who was once anointed, was anointed anew. He who was redee med, in turn redeemed (oth ers). Indeed, one must utter a mystery. The Father of everything united with the virgin who came down, and a fire shone for him on that day. He appeared in the great bridal chamber. Therefore his body came into being on that very day. It left the bridal chamber as one who came into being from the bridegroom and the bride. So Jesus established everythi ng in it through these. It is fitting for each of the disciples to enter into his rest. Adam came into being from two virgins, from the Spirit and from the virgin earth. Christ therefor e, was born from a virgin to rectify the Fall which occurred in the beginning. There are two trees growing in Paradise. The one bears anima ls, the other bears men. Adam ate from the tree which bore animals. He became an animal and he brought forth animal s. For this reason the children of Adam worship animals. The tree [...] fruit is [...] increased.

It would be fitting for the gods to worship men! Surely what a man accompl ishes depends on his abilities. For this reason, we refer to one`s accomplishments as \"abilities\". Among his accomp lishments are his children. They originate in a moment of ease. Thus his abilities determine what he may accomplish, but this ease is clearly evident in the children. You will find that this applies direct ly to the image. Here is the man made after the image accomplishing things with his physi cal strength, but producing his children with ease. In this world, the slaves serve the free. In the Kingdom of Heaven, the free will minister to the slaves: the children of the bridal chamber will minister to the children of the marriage. The children of the bridal cham ber have just one name: rest. Altogether, they need take no other form, because they have contempl ation, [...]. They are num erous [...] in the things [...] the glories [...]. Those [...] go down into the water. [...] out (of the water), will conse crate it, [...] they who have [...] in his name. For he said, \"Thus we should fulfill all righteousness.\" (Mt 3:15) Those who say they will die first and then rise are in error. If they do not first receiv e the resurrectio n while they live, when they die they will receive nothing. So also when speak ing about baptism they say, \"Baptism is a great thi ng,\" because if people receive it they w ill live. Philip the apostle said, \"Joseph the carpenter planted a garden because he needed wood for his trade. It was he who made the cross from the trees which he planted. His own offspring hung on that which he planted. His offspring was Jesus, and the planting was the cross.\" But the Tree of Life is in the middle of the Garden. However, it is from the olive tree that we got the chrism, and from the chrism, the resurrectio n. This world is a corpse-eater. All the things eaten in it themse lves die also. Truth is a life-eater. Theref ore no one nourished by truth will die. It was from that place that Jesus came and brought food. To those who so desired, he gave life, that they might not die. God [...] garden. Man [...] garden. There are [...] and [...] of God. [...] The things which are in [...] I wish. This garden is the place where they will say to me, \"[...] eat this or do not eat that, just as you wish.\" In the place where I will eat all things is the Tree of Knowledge. That one killed Adam, but here the Tree of Know ledge made men alive. The law was the tree. It has power to give the know ledge of good and evil. It neither remove d him from evil, nor did it set him in the good, but it created death for those who ate of it. For when he said, \"Eat this, do not eat that\", it became the beginning of death. - 1 0 8 -"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The chrism is superior to baptism, for it is from the word \"Chrism\" that we have been called \"Christians,\" certainly not because of the word \"baptism\". And it is because of the chrism that \"the Christ\" has his name. For the Father anointed the Son, and the Son anointed the apostl es, and the apostl es anointed us. He who has been anointed possesses everythi ng. He possesses the resurrectio n, the light, the cross, the Holy Spirit. The Father gave him this in the bridal chamber; he merely accepted (the gift). The Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. This is the Kingdom of Heaven. The Lord said it well: \"Some have entered the Kingdom of Heaven laughing, and they have come out [...] because [...] a Christi an, [...]. And as soon as [...] went down into the water, he came [...] everything (of this world) , [...] because he [...] a trifle, but [...] full of contempt for this [...] the Kingdom of Heaven [...] If he despises [...], and scorns it as a trifle, [...] out laughing. So it is also with the bread and the cup and the oil, even though there is another one superior to these. The world came about throug h a mistake. For he who created it wanted to create it imperis hable and immortal. He fell short of attain ing his desire. For the world never was imperishable, nor, for that matter, was he who made the world. For things are not imperis hable, but sons are. Nothing will be able to receive imperis hability if it does not first become a son. But he who has not the ability to receive, how much more wi ll he be unab le to give? The cup of prayer contains wine and water, since it is appointed as the type of the blood for which thank s is given. And it is full of the Holy Spirit, and it belongs to the wholly perfect man. When we drink this, we shall receive for ourselv es the perfect man. The living water is a body. It is necessary that we put on the living man. Therefore, when he is about to go down into the water, he unclothes himself, in order that he may put on the living man. A horse sires a horse, a man begets man, a god brings forth a god. Compare the bridegroom and the bride. They have come from the [...]. No Jew [...] has existed. And [...] from the Jews. [...] Christi ans [...] these [...] are referred to as \"The chosen people of [...],\" and \"The true man\" and \"Son of Man\" and \"the seed of the Son of Man\". This true race is renow ned in the world [...] that the sons of the bridal cham ber dwell. Whereas in this world the union is one of husba nd with wife - a case of strength complemented by weakness(?) - in the Aeon (eternal realm), the form of the union is different, although we refer to them by the same names. There are other names, however; they are superior to every other name that is named and are stronger than the strong. For where there is a show of strength, there those who excel in strength appear. These are not separate things, but both of them are this one single thing. This is the one which will not be able to rise above the heart of flesh. Is it not necessary for all those who possess everything to know themsel ves? Some indeed, if they do not know themsel ves, will not enjoy what they possess. But those who have come to know themse lves will enjoy their possessions. Not only will they be unable to detain the perfect man, but they will not be able to see him, for if they see him, they will detain him. There is no other way for a person to acquire this quality except by putting on the perfect light and he too becom ing perfect light. He who has put it on will enter [...]. This is the perfect [...] that we [...] become [...] before we leave [...]. Whoever receives everything [...] hither [...] be able [...] that place, but will [...] the Middle as imperfe ct. Only Jesus knows the end of this person. The priest is comple tely holy, down to his very body. For if he has taken the bread, he will consecrate it. Or the cup or anyth ing else that he gets, he will consec rate. Then how will he not consecrate the body also? By perfecting the water of baptism, Jesus emptied it of death. Thus we do go down into the water, but we do not go down into death, in order that we may not be poured out into the spirit of the world. When that spirit blows, it brings the winter. When the Holy Spirit breathes, the summer comes. He who has know ledge of the truth is a free man, but the free man does not sin, for \"He who sins is the slave of sin\" (Jn 8:34). Truth is the mother, knowledge the father. Those who think that - 1 0 9 -"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"sinning does not apply to them are called \"free\" by the world. Knowledge of the truth merely makes such peopl e arrogan t, which is what the words, \"it makes them free\" mean. It even gives them a sense of superiority over the whole world. But \"Love builds up\" (1 Co 8:1). In fact, he who is really free, through knowl edge, is a slave, because of love for those who have not yet been able to attain to the freedom of knowledge. Know ledge makes them capable of becom ing free. Love never calls somethi ng its own, [...] it [...] possess [...]. It never says,\"Th is is yours\" or \"This is mine,\" but \"All these are yours\". Spiritua l love is wine and fragrance. All those who anoint themse lves with it take pleasure in it. While those who are anointed are present, those nearby also profit (from the fragrance). If those anointed with ointme nt withdraw from them and leave, then those not anoint ed, who merely stand nearby, still remain in their bad odor. The Samaritan gave nothing but wine and oil to the wound ed man. It is nothing other than the ointment. It healed the wounds, for \"love covers a multitude of sins\" (1 P 4:8). The children a woma n bears resembl e the man who loves her. If her husba nd loves her, then they resemble her husband. If it is an adulterer, then they resemble the adulterer. Freque ntly, if a woman sleeps with her husband out of necess ity, while her heart is with the adulterer with whim she usually has intercourse, the child she will bear is born resemb ling the adulterer. Now you who live together with the Son of God, love not the world, but love the Lord, in order that those you will bring forth may not res emble the w orld, but may resemble the Lord. The human being has interc ourse with the human being. The horse has interc ourse with the horse, the ass with the ass. Membe rs of a race usually have associated with those of like race. So spirit mingles with spirit, and thought consorts with thought, and light shares with light. If you are born a human being, it is the human being who will love you. If you become a spirit, it is the spirit which will be joined to you. If you becom e thought, it is thought which will mingle with you. If you become light, it is the light which will share with you. If you become one of those who belong above, it is those who belong above who will rest upon you. If you become horse or ass or bull or dog or sheep, or another of the animal s which are outside or below, then neither human being nor spirit nor though t nor light will be able to love you. Neither those who belong above nor those who belong within will be able to rest in you, and you have no part i n them. He who is a slave against his will, will be able to become free. He who has become free by favor of his master, and has sold himsel f into slavery, will no longer be able to be free. Farming in the world requires the cooperatio n of four essential elements. A harvest is gathered into the barn only as a result of the natural action of water, earth, wind and light. God's farming likewise has four elements - faith, hope, love, and knowledge. Faith is our earth, that in which we take root. And hope is the water through which we are nouris hed. Love is the wind through which we grow. Knowledge, then, is the light through which we ripen. Grace exists in four ways: it is earthbor n; it is heave nly; [...] the highest heave n; [...] in [...]. Blessed is the one who on no occasion cause d a soul [...]. That person is Jesus Christ. He came to the whole place and did not burden anyone. Therefore, blessed is the one who is like this, because he is a perfect man. For the Word tells us that this kind is difficult to define. How shall we be able to accomp lish such a great thing? How will he give everyone comfort? Above all, it is not proper to cause anyone distress - whether the person is great or small, unbeliever or believer - and then give comfort only to those who take satisfaction in good deeds. Some find it advantag eous to give comfort to the one who has fared well. He who does good deeds cannot give comfort to such people, for he does not seize whatever he likes. He is unable to cause distress, howe ver, since he does not afflict them. To be sure, the one who fares well sometimes cause s peopl e distress - not that he intends to do so; rather, it is their own wicked ness which is responsi ble for their distres s. He who possesses the qualities (of the perfect man) bestows joy upon the good. Some, however, are terribly distressed by all this.

Compare the discip le of God: if he is a sensible fellow, he understands what discip leship is all about. The bodily forms will not deceive him, but he will look at the condition of the soul of each one and speak with him. There are many animals in the world which are in a human form. When he identifies them, to the swine he will throw acorns, to the cattle he will throw barley and chaff and grass, to the dogs he will throw bones. To the slaves he will give only the elementa ry lessons, to the children he will give the complete instruction. There is the Son of Man and there is the son of the Son of Man. The Lord is the Son of Man, and the son of the Son of Man is he who creates through the Son of Man. The Son of Man receiv ed from God the capacity to create. He also has the ability to beget.

Indeed, marriage in the world is a mystery for those who have taken a wife. If there is a hidde n quality to the marriage of defilement, how much more is the undef iled marriage a true mystery! It is not fleshly, but pure. It belongs not to desire, but to the will. It belongs not to the darkness or the night, but to the day and the light. If a marriage is open to the public, it has become prostitution , and the bride plays the harlot not only when she is impregnated by another man, but even if she slips out of her bedroom and is seen. Let her show herself only to her father and her mother, and to the friend of the bridegroom and the sons of the bridegroom. These are permitted to enter every day into the bridal chamber. But let the others yearn just to listen to her voice and to enjoy her ointme nt, and let them feed from the crumbs that fall from the table, like the dogs. Bridegrooms and brides belong to the bridal chamber. No one shall be able to see the bridegroom with the bride unless he become such a one. When Abraham [...] that he was to see what he was to see, he circumcised the flesh of the foreskin, teaching us that it is proper to destroy the flesh. Most things in the world, as long as their inner parts are hidden , stand upright and live. If they are revealed, they die, as is illustrated by the visible man: as long as the intestines of the man are hidden , the man is alive; when his intest ines are exposed and come out of him, the man will die. So also with the tree: while its root is hidden, it sprouts and grows. If its root is exposed, the tree dries up. So it is with every birth that is in the world, not only with the revealed but with the hidden . For so long as the root of wickedness is hidde n, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. That is why the Word says, \"Already the axe is laid at the root of the trees\" (Mt 3:10). It will not merely cut - what is cut sprouts again - but the ax penetrates deeply, until it brings up the root. Jesus pulled out the root of the whole place, while others did it only partially. As for ourselves, let each one of us dig down after the root of evil which is within one, and let one pluck it out of one's heart from the root. It will be plucked out if we recognize it. But if we are ignorant of it, it takes root in us and produces its fruit in our heart. It masters us. We are its slaves. It takes us captive, to make us do what we do not want; and what we do want, we do not do. It is powerfu l because we have not recognized it. While it exists it is active. Ignor ance is the mother of all evil. Ignorance will result in death, because those who come from ignoran ce neither were nor are nor shall be. [...] will be perfect when all the truth is revealed. For truth is like ignorance: while it is hidden, it rests in itself, but when it is revealed and is recog nized, it is praised, inasmuc h as it is stronger than ignoran ce and error. It gives freedom. The Word said, \"If you know the truth, the truth will make you free\" (Jn 8:32). Ignoranc e is a slave. Knowledge is freedom. If we know the truth, we shall find the fruits of the truth within us. If we are joined to it, it will bring our fulfillment. At the present time, we have the manifest things of creatio n. We say, \"The strong who are held in high regard are great people. And the weak who are despised are the obscure.\" Contrast the manifest things of truth: they are weak and despised, while the hidde n things are strong and held - 1 1 1 -"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"in high regard. The mysteries of truth are revealed, though in type and image. The bridal cham ber, howe ver, remains hidde n. It is the Holy in the Holy.

And the whole (inferior) godhead will flee from here, but not into the holies of the holies, for it will not be able to mix with the unmixed light and the flawless fullness, but will be under the wings of the cross and under its arms. This ark will be their salvation when the flood of water surges over them. If some belong to the order of the priesthood, they will be able to go within the veil with the high priest. For this reason, the veil was not rent at the top only, since it would have been open only to those above; nor was it rent at the bottom only, since it would have been revealed only to those below. But it was rent from the top to bottom . Those above opened to us the things below, in order that we may go in to the secret of the truth. This truly is what is held in high regard, (and) what is strong! But we shall go in there by means of lowly types and forms of weakness. They are lowly indeed when compared with the perfect glory. There is glory which surpasses glory. There is power which surpa sses power. Theref ore, the perfect things have opened to us, together with the hidde n things of truth. The holies of the holies were revealed, and the bridal chamb er invited us in. As long as it is hidden, wickedn ess is indeed ineffectual, but it has not been remove d from the midst of the seed of the Holy Spirit. They are slaves of evil. But when it is revealed, then the perfect light will flow out on every one. And all those who are in it will receive the chrism. Then the slaves will be free and the captiv es ransomed. \"Every plant which my father who is in heaven has not planted will be pluck ed out.\" (Mt 15:13) Those who are separated wi ll unite [...] and will be filled. Every one who will enter the bridal chamber will kindle the light, for [...] just as in the marriages which are [...] happen at night. That fire [...] only at night, and is put out. But the mysterie s of that marriage are perfected rather in the day and the light. Neither that day nor its light ever sets. If anyone becom es a son of the bridal chamb er, he will receive the light. If anyone does not receive it while he is here, he will not be able to receive it in the other place. He who will receive that light will not be seen, nor can he be detained. And none shall be able to torment a person like this, even while he dwells in the world. And again when he leaves the world, he has already received the truth in the images. The world has become the Aeon (eternal realm), for the Aeon is fullness for him. This is the way it is: it is revealed to him alone, not hidde n in the darkness and the night, but hidden in a perfect day and a holy light.

On accoun t of the reality of the author ities, (inspired ) by the spirit of the father of truth, the great apostl e - referring to the \"authorities of the darkn ess\" - told us that \"our contest is not against flesh and blood; rather, the authorit ies of the universe and the spirits of wickednes s.\" I have sent this (to you) because you inquire about th e reality of the author ities. Their chief is blind; because of his power and his ignora nce and his arrogance he said, with his power, \"It is I who am God; there is none apart from me.\" When he said this, he sinned against the entirety. And this speech got up to incorruptibility; then there was a voice that came forth from incorrupti bility, saying, \"You are mistaken, Samael\" - which is, \"god of the blind.\" His thoughts became blind. And, having expelle d his power - that is, the blasphemy he had spoken - he pursued it down to chaos and the abyss, his mother, at the instigation of Pistis Sophia. And she establ ished each of his offspring in conformit y with its power - after the pattern of the realms that are above, for by starting from the invisible world the visible world was invented. As incorrupt ibility looked down into the region of the waters, her image appeared in the waters; and the authorities of the darkness became enamored of her. But they could not lay hold of that image, which had appeared to them in the waters, because of their weakness - since beings that merel y possess a soul cannot lay hold of those that possess a spirit - for they were from below, while it was from above . This is the reason why \"incorruptibility looked down into the region (etc.)\": so that, by the father's will, she might bring the entirety into union with the light. The rulers laid plans and said, \"Come, let us create a man that will be soil from the earth.\" They modele d their creatur e as one wholly of the earth. Now the rulers [...] body [...] they have [...] female [...] is [...] with the face of a beast. They had taken some soil from the earth and modeled their man after their body and after the image of God that had appeared to them in the waters. They said, \"Come, let us lay hold of it by means of the form that we have modeled, so that it may see its male counterpart [...], and we may seize it with the form that we have modeled\" - not understand ing the force of God, because of their powerless ness. And he breathed into his face; and the man came to have a soul (and remained) upon the ground many days. But they could not make him arise because of their powerlessness. Like storm winds they persisted (in blowing), that they might try to capture that image, which had appeared to them in the waters. And they did not know the identity of its pow er. Now all these things came to pass by the will of the father of the entirety. Afterwards , the spirit saw the soul-endowed man upon the ground. And the spirit came forth from the Adamantine Land; it descended and came to dwell within him, and that man became a living soul. It called his name Adam, since he was found movin g upon the groun d. A voice came forth from incorrupti bility for the assistance of Adam; and the rulers gathered together all the animals of the earth and all the birds of heaven and brought them in to Adam to see what Adam would call them, that he might give a name to each of the birds and all the beasts. They took Adam and put him the garden, that he might cultivate it and keep watch over it. And the rulers issued a command to him, saying, \"From every tree in the garden shall you eat; yet from the tree of recognizing good and evil do not eat, nor touch it; for the day you eat from it, with death you are going to die.\" - 1 1 3 -"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"They [...] this. They do not understand what they have said to him; rather, by the father's will, they said this in such a way that he might (in fact) eat, and that Adam might <not> regard them as would a man of an exclusively material nature. The rulers took counse l with one another and said, \"Come, let us cause a deep sleep to fall upon Adam .\" And he slept. - Now the deep sleep that they \"caused to fall upon him, and he slept\" is Ignor ance. - They opened his side like a living woman. And they built up his side with some flesh in place of her, and Adam came to be endowed only with soul. And the spirit-endowed woman came to him and spoke with him, saying, \"Arise, Adam.\" And when he saw her, he said, \"It is you who have given me life; you will be called 'mother of the living'. - For it is she who is my mother. It is she who is the physician, and the woman, and she who has giv en birth.\" Then the authorit ies came up to their Adam. And when they saw his female counterpart speaking with him, they became agitated with great agitatio n; and they became enamored of her. They said to one anoth er, \"Com e, let us sow our seed in her,\" and they pursued her. And she laughed at them for their witlessness and their blindness; and in their clutches she became a tree, and left before them her shadowy reflection resembl ing herself; and they defiled it foully. - And they defiled the stamp of her voice, so that by the form they had modele d, together with their (own) image, they made themselves liable to condemnation. Then the female spiritua l principle came in the snake, the instructor ; and it taught them, saying, \"What did he say to you? Was it, 'From every tree in the garden shall you eat; yet - from the tree of recog nizing good and evil do not eat'?\" The carnal woman said, \"Not only did he say ‘Do not eat’, but even ‘Do not touch it; for the day you eat from it, with death you are going to die.’\" And the snake, the instru ctor, said, \"With death you shall not die; for it was out of jealousy that he said this to you. Rather your eyes shall open and you shall come to be like gods, recognizi ng evil and good.\" And the female instru cting principle was taken away from the snake, and she left it behind, merel y a thing of the earth. And the carnal woman took from the tree and ate; and she gave to her husba nd as well as hersel f; and these beings that possessed only a soul, ate. And their imperfe ction became apparent in their lack of knowledge; and they recogn ized that they were naked of the spiritual element, and took fig leaves and bound them upon their loins. Then the chief ruler came; and he said, \"Adam! Where are you?\" - for he did not understand what had happened. And Adam said, \"I heard your voice and was afraid because I was naked; and I hid.\" The ruler said, \"Why did you hide, unless it is because you have eaten from the tree from which alone I commanded you not to eat? And you have eaten!\" Adam said, \"The woma n that you gave me, she gave to me and I ate.\" And the arrogant ruler cursed the woman. The woman said, \"It was the snake that led me astray and I ate.\" They turned to the snake and cursed its shadowy reflection, [...] powerless, not comprehend ing that it was a form they themse lves had modeled. From that day, the snake came to be under the curse of the authoriti es; until the all-powerfu l man was to come, that curse fell upon the snake. They turned to their Adam and took him and expell ed him from the garden along with his wife; for they have no blessing, since they too are beneath the curse. Moreover, they threw mankind into great distracti on and into a life of toil, so that their mankind might be occup ied by worldly affairs, and might not have the oppor tunity of being devoted to the holy spirit. Now afterwards, she bore Cain, their son; and Cain cultivated the land. Thereupon he knew his wife; again becomi ng pregnant, she bore Abel; and Abel was a herdsman of sheep. Now Cain brought in from the crops of his field, but Abel brought in an offering (from ) amon g his lambs.

It will return to you: anyone who kills Cain will let loose seven vengean ces, and you will exist groan ing and tremb ling upon the earth.\" And Adam knew his female counterpart Eve, and she became pregn ant, and bore Seth to Adam. And she said, \"I have borne another man through God, in place of Abel.\" Again Eve became pregnan t, and she bore Norea. And she said, \"He has begotten on me a virgin as an assistance for many generation s of mankind.\" She is the virgin whom the forces did not defile. Then mankind began to multiply and improve. The rulers took counsel with one another and said, \"Come, let us cause a deluge with our hands and obliterate all flesh, from man to beast.\" But when the ruler of the forces came to know of their decision, he said to Noah, \"Make yourself an ark from some wood that does not rot and hide in it - you and your children and the beasts and the birds of heave n from sma ll to large - and set it upon Mount Sir.\" Then Orea came to him, wanting to board the ark. And when he would not let her, she blew upon the ark and caused it to be consumed by fire. Again he made the ark, for a second time. The rulers went to meet her, intending to lead her astray. Their supreme chief said to her, \"Your mother Eve came to us.\" But Norea turned to them and said to them, \"It is you who are the rulers of the darkness; you are accursed. And you did not know my mother; instead it was your female counterpart that you knew.

Why do you act so boldly towards the holy spirit? \" Norea s aid, \"Who are you? \" The rulers of unrig hteousn ess had withdrawn from her. He said, \"It is I who am Elelet h, sagacity, the great angel who stands in the presence of the holy spirit. I have been sent to speak with you and save you from the grasp of the lawless.

No, truly, my mouth cannot bear to speak of his power and the appearance of his face! Eleleth, the great angel, spoke to me. \"It is I,\" he said, \"who am understanding. I am one of the four light-givers, who stand in the presence of the great invisible spirit. Do you think these rulers have any power over you? None of them can prevai l against the root of truth; for on its account he appeared in the final ages; and these authorit ies will be restrained. And these authorities cannot defile you and that generation; for your abode is in incorruptibility, where the virgin spirit dwells, who is superior to the authorities of chaos and to their universe.\" But I said, \"Sir, teach me about the faculty of these authorities - how did they come into being, and by what kind of genesis, and of what material, and who created them and their force ?\" And the great angel Eleleth, understand ing, spoke to me: \"Within limitless realms dwells incorrupti bility. Sophia, who is called Pistis, wanted to create somethi ng, alone without her consort; and her product was a celest ial thing. A veil exists between the world above and the realms that are below; and shadow came into being beneath the veil; and that shadow became matter; and that shadow was projected apart. And what she had created became a product in the matter, like an aborted fetus. And it assumed a plastic form mol ded out of shadow, and became an arrogant beast resembling a lion. It was androgynous, as I have already said, because it was from matter that it derived. - 1 1 5 -"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Openin g his eyes, he saw a vast quantit y of matter without limit; and he became arrogant, saying, \"It is I who am God, and there is none other apart from me\". When he said this, he sinned against the entirety. And a voice came forth from above the realm of absolute power, saying, \"You are mistaken, Samael\" - which is, 'god of the blind'. And he said, \"If any other thing exists before me, let it become visible to me!\" And immediately Sophia stretched forth her finger and introdu ced light into matter; and she pursued it down to the region of chaos. And she returned up to her light; once again darkness [...] matter. This ruler, by being androgyn ous, made himsel f a vast realm, an extent without limit. And he contemplated creati ng offspr ing for himse lf, and created for himsel f seven offspring, androgynous just like their parent. And he said to his offspring, \"It is I who am god of the entirety. \" And Zoe (Life), the daughter of Pistis Sophia, cried out and said to him, \"You are mistaken, Sakla!\" - for which the alternative name is Yaltabaoth. She breathed into his face, and her breath became a fiery angel for her; and that angel bound Yaldabaot h and cast him down into Tartaros below the abyss. Now when his offspr ing Sabaoth saw the force of that angel, he repented and condem ned his father and his mother, matter. He loathed her, but he sang songs of praise up to Sophia and her daugh ter Zoe. And Sophia and Zoe caught him up and gave him charge of the seventh heaven, below the veil between above and below. And he is called 'God of the forces, Sabaoth', since he is up above the forces of chaos, for Sophia establi shed him. Now when these (events) had come to pass, he made himsel f a huge four-faced chariot of cherubim, and infinitely many angels to act as ministers, and also harps and lyres. And Sophia took her daughter Zoe and had her sit upon his right to teach him about the things that exist in the eighth (heaven); and the angel of wrath she placed upon his left. Since that day, his right has been called 'life'; and the left has come to repres ent the unrig hteousn ess of the realm of absolute power above. It was before your time that they came into being. Now when Yaldabaoth saw him (Sabaoth) in this great splendor and at this height, he envied him; and the envy became an androgynous product, and this was the origin of envy. And envy engendered death; and death engendered his offspring and gave each of them charge of its heave n; and all the heavens of chaos became full of their multitudes. But it was by the will of the father of the entirety that they all came into being - after the pattern of all the things above - so that the sum of chaos might be attained. \"There, I have taugh t you a bout the pattern of the rulers; and the matter in which it was expressed; and their parent; and their universe.\" But I said, \"Sir, am I also from th eir matter?\" \"You, together with your offspri ng, are from the primeval father; from above, out of the imperishable light, their souls are come.

She even has her womb. As long as she was alone with the father, she was virgin and in form androgynous. But when she fell down into a body and came to this life, then she fell into the hands of many robbers. And the wanton creatures passed her from one to another and [...] her. Some made use of her by force, while others did so by seduc ing her with a gift. In short, they defiled her, and she [...] her virginity. And in her body she prostituted herself and gave herself to one and all, considering each one she was about to embrace to be her husban d. When she had given hersel f to wanto n, unfaithful adulterers, so that they might make use of her, then she sighed deeply and repented. But even when she turns her face from those adulterers, she runs to others and they compel her to live with them and render service to them upon their bed, as if they were her masters. Out of shame she no longer dares to leave them, whereas they deceive her for a long time, pretending to be faithful, true h usbands, as if they greatly respected her. And after all this they abandon her and go. She then becomes a poor desolate widow, without help; not even a measure of food was left her from the time of her affliction. For from them she gained nothing except the defilements they gave her while they had sexual intercourse with her. And her offspring by the adulterers are dumb, blind and sickly. They are feebleminded. But when the father who is above visits her and looks down upon her and sees her sighing - with her sufferings and disgrace - and repentin g of the prostitution in which she engaged, and when she begins to call upon his name so that he might help her, [...] all her heart, saying \"Save me, my father, for behol d I will render an account to thee, for I abando ned my house and fled from my maiden `s quarters. Restore me to thysel f again.\" When he sees her in such a state, then he will count her worthy of his mercy upon her, for many are the afflictions that have come upon her because she aband oned her house. Now concerning the prostitutio n on the soul, the Holy Spirit prophes ies in many places. For he said in the proph et Jeremiah (3:1-4), If the husba nd divorces his wife and she goes and takes another man, can she return to him after that? Has not that woman utterly defiled herself? \"And you prosti tuted yourse lf to many shepherds and you returned to me!\" said the lord. \"Take an honest look and see where you prosti tuted yourself. Were you not sitting in the streets defiling the land with your acts of prosti tution and your vices? And you took many shepherds for a stumbli ng block for yourself. You became shameless with everyone. You did not call on me as kinsma n or as father or author of your v irginity\". Again it is writte n in the prophet Hosea (2:2-7), Come, go to law with your mother, for she is not to be a wife to me nor I a husband to her. I shall remove her prostitution from my presence, and I shall remove her adultery from between her breasts. I shall make her naked as on the day she was born, and I shall make her desolate like a land without water, and I shall make her longingly childless. I shall show her children no pity, for they are children of prostitutio n, since their mother prostituted herself and put her children to shame. For she said, \"I shall prostitute myself to my lovers. It was they who gave me my bread and my water and my garments and my clothes and my wine and my oil and everything I needed.\" Therefore behold I shall shut them up so that she shall not be able to run after her - 1 1 9 -"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"adulterers. And when she seeks them and does not find them, she will say, 'I shall return to my former husba nd, in those days I was better off than now.\" Again he said in Ezekiel (16:23- 26), It came to pass after much depravity, said the lord, you built yourself a brothel and you made yoursel f a beautiful place in the streets. And you built yourse lf brothel s on every lane, and you wasted your beauty , and you spread your legs in every alley, and you multiplied your acts of prosti tution. You prostituted yourself to the sons of Egypt, those who are your neigh bors, men great of flesh. But what does \"the sons of Egypt, men great of flesh\" mean, if not the domain of the flesh and the perceptib le realm and the affairs of the earth, by which the soul has become defiled here, receiving bread from them, as well as wine, oil, clothing, and the other external nonsense surrounding the body - the things she thinks she needs. But as to this prostitutio n, the apostles of the savior commanded (Acts 15:20, 29; 21:25; 1Th 4:3; 1 Co 6:18; 2 Co 7:1): \"Guard yourselves against it, purify yourselves from it,\" speaking not just of the prosti tution of the body but especially that of the soul. For this reason the apostles write to the churches of God, th at such prostitutio n might not occur among us. Yet the greatest struggle has to do with the prostitution of the soul. From it arises the prostitution of the body as well. Theref ore Paul, writing to the Corinthians (1Co 5:9-10), said, \"I wrote you in the letter, 'Do not associate with prostitutes,' not at all (mean ing) the prosti tutes of this world or the greedy or the thieves or the idolaters, since then you would have to go out from the world.\" - here it is speaking spiritua lly - \"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood - as he said (Ep 6:12) - but against the world rulers of this darkness and the spirits of wickedness.\" As long as the soul keeps running about everywhere copulati ng with whomever she meets and defiling herself, she exists suffering her just deserts. But when she perceives the straits she is in and weeps before the father and repents, then the father will have mercy on her and he will make her womb turn from the externa l domain and will turn it again inward, so that the soul will regain her proper character. For it is not so with a woman. For the womb of the body is inside the body like the other internal organ s, but the womb of the soul is around the outside like the male genita lia which is external. So when the womb of the soul, by the will of the father, turns itself inward, it is baptized and is immediatel y cleansed of the external pollutio n which was pressed upon it, just as garments, when dirty, are put into the water and turned about until their dirt is remove d and they become clean. And so the cleansing of the soul is to regain the newn ess of her former nature and to turn herself back again. That is her baptism. Then she will begin to rage at herself like a woma n in labor, who writh es and rages in the hour of delivery. But since she is female, by hersel f she is powerless to beget a child. From heaven the father sent her her man, who is her brother, the firstborn. Then the bridegroom came down to the bride. She gave up her former prostitutio n and cleansed herself of the pollut ions of the adulterers, and she was renewed so as to be a bride. She cleansed hersel f in the bridal chambe r; she filled it with perfume; she sat in it waiting for the true bridegroom. No longer does she run about the market place, copulat ing with whomev er she desires, but she continued to wait for him - (saying) \"When will he come?\" - and to fear him, for she did not know what he looked like: she no longer rememb ers since the time she fell from her father's house. But by the will of the father <...> And she dreamed of him like a woman in love with a man. But then the bridegr oom, according to the father's will, came down to her into the bridal chambe r, which was prepared. And he decor ated the bridal cham ber. For since that marriage is not like the carnal marriage, those who are to have intercourse with one another will be satisfi ed with that intercourse. And as if it were a burden, they leave behind them the annoyan ce of physical desire and they turn their faces from each other. But this marriage [...]. But once they unite with one another, they become a single life. Where fore the prophet said (Gn 2:24) concerning the first man and the first woman, \"They will becom e a single flesh.\" For they - 1 2 0 -"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"were originally joined one to anoth er when they were with the father before the woman led astray the man, who is her brother. This marriage has brought them back together again and the soul has been joined to her true love, her real master, as it is writte n (cf. Gn 3:16; 1 Co 11;1; Ep 5:23), \"For the master of the w oman is her husband.\" Then gradually she recognized him, and she rejoiced once more, weeping before him as she rememb ered the disgrace of her former widowhood. And she adorned hersel f still more so that he might be pleased to stay with her. And the prophet said in the Psalms (Ps 45:10-11): \"Hear, my daughter, and see and incline your ear and forget your people and your father's house, for the king has desired your beauty, for he is your l ord.\" For he requires her to turn her face from her people and the multitude of her adulterers, in whose midst she once was, to devote hersel f only to her king, her real lord, and to forget the house of the earthly father, with whom things went badly for her, but to rememb er her father who is in heaven. Thus also it was said (Gn 12:1) to Abraham: \"Come out from your country and your kinsfolk and from your father `s house\" Thus when the soul had adorned hersel f again in her beauty [...] enjoyed her beloved, and he also loved her. And when she had intercourse with him, she got from him the seed that is the life- giving spirit, so that by him she bears good children and rears them. For this is the great, perfect marvel of birth. And so this marriage is made pe rfect by the will of the father. Now it is fitting that the soul regenerates hersel f and become again as she formerly was. The soul then move s of her own accord. And she received the divine nature from the father for her rejuvenation, so that she might be restored to the place where originally she had been. This is the resurrectio n that is from the dead. This is the ransom from captivity. This is the upward journey of ascent to heave n. This is the way of ascent to the father. Therefore the proph et said (Ps 103:1-5): \"Praise the lord, O my soul, and, all that is within me, (praise ) his holy name. My soul, praise God, who forgave all your sins, who healed all your sicknesses, who ransomed your life from death, who crowned you with mercy, who satisfies your longing with good things. Your youth will be renew ed like an eagle's.\" Then when she becomes young again, she will ascend, praising the father and her brother, by whom she was rescued. Thus it is by being born again that the soul will be saved. And this is due not to rote phrases or to professio nal skills or to book learning. Rather it is the grace of the [...], it is the gift of the [...]. For such is this heavenly thing. Therefore the savior cries out (Jn 6:44), \"No one can come to me unless my Father draws him and brings him to me; and I myself will raise him up on the last day.\" It is therefore fitting to pray to the father and to call on him with all our soul - not externall y with the lips, but with the spirit, which is inward, which came forth from the depth - sighing; repenting for the life we lived; confessing our sins; percei ving the empty deceptio n we were in, and the empty zeal; weeping over how we were in darkness and in the wave; mourning for ourselves, that he might have pity on us; hating ourselves for how we are now. Again the savior said (cf Mt 5:4, Lk 6:12): \"Blessed are those who mourn, for it is they who will be pitied; blessed, those who are hungry, for it is they who will be filled.\" Again he said (cf.

Acts 13:24), \"Before Christ`s appearance came John, preac hing the baptis m of repentanc e.\" And repentan ce takes place in distress and grief. But the father is good and loves human ity, and he hears the soul that calls upon him and sends it the light of salvat ion. Therefore he said throug h the spirit to the proph et (cf. 1 Cl 8:3), \"Say to the children of my people, 'If your sins extend from earth to heaven, and if they become red like scarlet and blacker than sackcl oth, and if you return to me with all your s oul and say to me 'my Father!' , I will heed you as a holy people.'\" Again another place (Is 30:15), \"Thus says the lord, the holy one of Israel: \"If you return and sigh, then you will be saved and will know where you were when you trusted in what is empty.\" - 1 2 1 -"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Again he said in another place (Is 30:19-20), \"Jerusale m wept much , saying, 'Have pity on me.'

From now on, those who deceive will not approach you again. Your e yes will see those who are decei ving you.\" Theref ore it is fitting to pray to God night and day, spreading out our hands towards him as do people sailing in the middle of the sea: they pray to God with all their heart without hypocr isy. For those who pray hypocr itically deceive only themselves. Indeed, it is in order that he might know who is worth y of salvation that God examines the inward parts and searches the bottom of the heart. For no one is worthy of salvation who still loves the plac e of deception . Theref ore it is written in the poet (Homer, Ody ssey 1.48-1.59), \"Odysseus sat on the island weeping and grieving and turning his face from the words of Calypso and from her tricks, longing to see his village and smoke coming forth from it. And had he not received help from heaven, he would not have been able to return to his village.\" Again Helen <...> saying ( Ody ssey 4.260-261), \"My heart turned itself from me.

But if she sighs and repents, she will be restored to her house. Certainly Israel would not have been visited in the first place, to be brought out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, if it had not sighed to God and wept for the oppression of its labors. Again it is written in the Psalms (6:6-9), \"I was greatly troub led in my groaning. I will bathe my bed and my cover each night with my tears. I have become old in the midst of all my enemies. Depart from me, all you who work at lawlessn ess, for behol d the lord has heard the cry of my weeping and the lord has heard my pra yer.\" If we repent, truly God will heed us, he who is long suffering and abundantly mercifu l, to whom is the glory for ever and ever.

After five thousand years, the great light Eleleth spoke: \"Let someone reign over the chaos and Hades. \" And there appeared a cloud whose name is hylic Sophia [...] She looked out on the parts of the chaos, her face being like [...] in her form [...] blood. And the great angel Gamaliel spoke to the great Gabrie l, the minister of the great light Oroiael; he said, \"Let an angel come forth, in order that he may reign over the chaos and Hades.\" Then the cloud, being agreeable, came forth in the two monads, each one of which had light. [...] the throne, which she had placed in the cloud above. Then Sakla, the great angel, saw the great demon who is with him, Nebruel. And they became together a begetting spirit of the earth. They begot assisti ng angels. Sakla said to the great demon Nebruel, \"Let the twelve aeons come into being in the [...] aeon, worlds [...].\" [...] the great angel Sakla said by the will of the Autogenes, \"There shall be the [...] of the number of seven [...].\" And he said to the great angels, \"Go and let each of you reign over his world.\" Each one of these twelve angels went forth. The first angel is Athoth. He is the one whom the great genera tions of men call [...]. The second is Harmas, who is the eye of the fire. The third is Galila. The fourth is Yobel. The fi fth is Ado naios, who is called 'Sabaoth'. The sixth is Cain, whom the great genera tions of men call the sun. The seventh is Abel; the eighth Akiressina; the ninth Yubel. The tenth is Harm upiae l. The eleventh is Archir-Adonin. The twelfth is Belias. These are the ones who preside over Hades and the chaos. And after the foundi ng of the world, Sakla said to his angels, \"I, I am a jealous god, and apart from me nothing has come into being,\" since he trusted i n his nature. Then a voice came from on high, saying, \"The Man exists, and the Son of the Man.\" Because of the descent of the image above, which is like its voice in the height of the image which has looked out through the looking out of the image above, the first creature was formed. Because of this, Metanoi a came into being. She received her completion and her power by the will of the Father, and his approval, with which he approve d of the great, incorrupti ble, immovable race of the great, mighty men of the great Seth, in order that he may sow it in the aeons which had been brough t forth, so that through her (Meta noia), the deficiency may be filled up. For she had come forth from above, down to the world, which is the image of the night. When she had come, she prayed for (the repentance of) both the seed of the archon of this aeon, and <the> authorities who had come forth from him, that defiled (seed) of the demon-begetting god which will be destroyed, and the seed of Adam and the great Seth, which is like the sun. Then the great angel Hormos came to prepare, through the virgins of the corrupted sowing of this aeon, in a Logos-begotten, holy vessel, throug h the holy Spirit, the seed of the great S eth. Then the great Seth came and brought his seed. And it was sown in the aeons which had been brought forth, their number being the amount of Sodom.

But oth ers (say) that the great Seth took his plant out of Gomorrah and planted it in the second place, to wh ich he gave the name 'Sodom'. This is the race which came forth through Edokla. For she gave birth through the word, to Truth and Justice, the origin of the seed of the eternal life, which is with those who will persevere, because of the knowledge of their emanation. This is the great, incorrupt ible race which has come forth throug h three worlds to the w orld. And the flood came as an example, for the consummation of the aeon. But it will be sent into the world because of this race. A conflagration will come upon the earth. And grace will be with those who belong to the race, through the prophets and the guard ians who guard the life of the race. Because of this race, famines will occur, and plagues. But these things will happen because of the great, in corrupt ible race. Because of this race, temptations will come, a falsehood of false prophets. Then the great Seth saw the activity of the devil, and his many guises, and his schemes, which will come upon his (Seth's) incorruptible, immovable race, and the persecutions of his powers and his angels, and thei r error, th at they acted against themselves. Then the great Seth gave praise to the great, uncal lable, virginal Spirit, and the male virgin Barbel on, and the thrice-male child Telmael Telmael Heli Heli Machar Macha r Seth, the powe r which really truly lives, and the male virgin Youel, and Esephech, the holder of glory and the crown of his glory, and the great Doxom edon-aeon, and the thrones which are in him, and the powers which surround them, and the whole pleroma, as I mentio ned before. And he asked for guard s over his seed. Then there came forth from the great aeons four hundred ethereal angels, accompan ied by the great Aerosiel and the great Selmechel, to guard the great, incorruptible race, its fruit, and the great men of the great Seth, from the time and the moment of Truth and Justice , until the consummation of the aeon and its archons, those whom the great judges have condemned to death. Then the great Seth was sent by the four lights, by the will of the Autoge nes and the whole pleroma, through <the gift> and the good pleasure of the great invisible Spirit, and the five seals, and the who le pleroma. He passed through the three parousias which I mentioned before: the flood, and the conflagration, and the judgment of the archo ns and the powers and the authoriti es, to save her (the race) who went astray, through the reconciliation of the world, and the baptism through a Logos-begotten body which the great Seth prepared for himse lf secretly through the virgin, in order that the saints may be begotten by the holy Spirit, through invisible, secret symbols, through a reconc iliation of the world with the world, through the renoun cing of the world, and the god of the thirteen aeons, and (through) the convo cations of the saints and the ineffable ones, and (through ) the incorrupti ble bosom, and (through) the great light of the Father, who pre-existed with his Providence, and established through her the holy baptism that surpasses the heaven , through the incorrupti ble, Logos-begotten one, even Jesus the living one, even he whom the great Seth has put on.

Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library , revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francis co, 1990. Eugnostos, the Blessed, to those who are his. Rejoice in this, that you know. Greetings! I want you to know that all men born from the foundation of the world until now are dust. While they have inquired about God, who he is and what he is like, they have not found him. The wisest among them have speculated about the truth from the ordering of the world. And the specul ation has not reached the truth. For the ordering is spoken of in three (different) opinio ns by all the philosophers; hence they do not agree. For some of them say about the world that it was directed by itself. Others, that it is providence (that directs it). Others, that it is fate. But it is none of these. Again, of three voices that I have just mentioned, none is true. For whateve r is from itself is an empty life; it is self-made. Providence is foolish. Fate is an undiscerning thing. Whoever, then, is able to get free of these three voices I have just mentioned and come by means of another voice to confess the God of truth and agree in everything concerning him, he is immortal dwel ling in the midst of mortal men. He-Who-Is is ineffable. No principle knew him, no authority, no subject ion, nor any creature from the foundat ion of the world, except he alone. For he is immortal and eternal, having no birth; for everyone who has birth will perish. He is unbegotte n, having no beginning; for everyone who has a beginning has an end. No one rules over him. He has no name; for whoever has a name is the creation of another. He is unnamea ble. He has no huma n form; for whoe ver has human form is the creation of anoth er. He has his own semblan ce - not like the sembla nce we have received and seen, but a strange semblance that surpasses all things and is better than the totalit ies. It looks to every side and see s itself from itself. He is infinite; he is incompre hensible. He is ever imperishable (and) has no likeness (to anything). He is unchanging good. He is faultl ess. He is everlasting. He is blessed. He is unknowable, while he (nonetheless) knows himsel f. He is immeasurable. He is untraceab le. He is perfect, having no defect. He is imperis hably blessed. He is called 'Father of the Universe'. Before anythi ng is visible among those that are visible, the majesty and the authoriti es that are in him, he embraces the totalities of the totalities, and nothing embraces him. For he is all mind, thought and reflec ting, considering, rationa lity and power. They all are equal powers. They are the sources of the totalities. And their whole race <from first> to last is in the foreknowledge of the Unbegotten, for they had not yet come to visibility. Now a difference existed among the imperishable aeons. Let us, then, consider (it) this way: Everything that came from the perisha ble will perish, since it came from the perishable. Whatever came from imperish ableness will not perish but will become imperis hable, since it came from imperishableness. So, many men went astray because they had not known this difference; that is, they died. But this much is enough, since it is impossi ble for anyone to dispute the nature of the words I have just spoken about the blessed, imperishable, true God. Now, if anyon e wants to believe the words set down (here), let him go from what is hidde n to the end of what is visible, and this Thought will instru ct him how faith in those things that are not visible was found in what is visible. This is a principle of knowl edge. The Lord of the Universe is not rightly called 'Father' but 'Forefather'. For the Father is the beginning ( or principle) of what is visible. For he (the Lord) is the begin ningless Forefather. He sees himsel f within himse lf, like a mirror, having appeared in his likene ss as Self-Father, that is, Self-Begette r, and as Confronter, since he confro nted Unbegotte n First Existent. He is indeed of equal age with the one who is before him, but he is not equal to him in power. - 1 3 4 -"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Afterward he reveale d many confronting, self-begotten ones, equal in age (and) power, being in glory and without number, who are called 'The Generatio n over Whom There Is No Kingdom among the Kingdoms That Exist'. And the whole multitude of the place over which there is no kingdom is called 'Sons of Unbegotten Father.' Now the Unknowable is ever full of imperis hableness and ineffable joy. They are all at rest in him, ever rejoicing in ineffable joy, over the unchanging glory and the measureless jubilation that was never heard or known among all the aeons and their worlds. But this much is enoug h, lest we go on endless ly. This is another principle of knowledge from <S elf->begotten. The First who appear ed before the universe in infinity is Self-grown, Self-constructed Father, and is full of shining, ineffable light. In the beginning, he decided to have his likeness become a great power. Immediately, the principle ( or beginning) of that Light appeared as Immortal Androgy nous Man. His male name is 'Begotten, Perfect Mind'. And his female name is 'All-wise Begettres s Sophia'. It is also said that she resembles her brother and her consort. She is uncontested truth; for here below , error, which exists with truth, contests it. Throug h Immortal Man appear ed the first designation, namely, divinity and kingdom , for the Father, who is called 'Self-Father Man' revealed this. He created a great aeon for his own majesty. He gave him great authority, and he ruled over all creations. He created gods and archangels and angels, myriads without number for retinue. Now through that Man originated divinity and kingdom. Therefore he was called 'God of gods', 'King of kings'. First Man is 'Faith' ('pistis') for those who will come afterwar d. He has, within, a unique mind and thought - just as he is it (thoug ht) - reflecting and considering, rationality and powe r. All the attributes that exist are perfect and immortal. In respect to imperish ableness, they are indeed equal. (But) in respect to power, there is a difference, like the difference between father and son, and son and thought, and the though t and the remainder. As I said earlier, among the things that were created the monad is first, the dyad follows it, and the triad, up to the tenths. Now the tenths rule the hundredths; the hundredt hs rule the thousandth s; the thousands rule the ten thousan ds. This is the pattern <among the> immortals. First Man is like this: His monad [...]. Again it is this pattern that exists among the immortals: the monad and the thought are those things that belong to Immortal Man. The thinkings are for <the> decads, and the hundreds are the teachings, and the thousan ds are the counsels, and the ten thousands are the powers. Now those who come from the [...] exist with their [...] in every aeon [...]. [...] In the begin ning, thought and thinkings appear ed from mind, then teachings from thinkings, counsels from teachings, and power from counse ls. And after all the attributes, all that was revealed appeared from his powe rs. And from what was created, what was fashioned appeared. And what was formed appeared from what was fashioned. What was named appeared from what was formed, while the difference among begotten things appeared from what was named, from beginning to end, by power of all the aeons. Now Immortal Man is full of every imperishable glory and ineffable joy. His whole kingdom rejoices in everlast ing rejoicing, those who never have been heard of or known in any aeon that came after th em and its worlds. Afterward anoth er principle came from Immorta l Man, who is called 'Self-perfected Begetter.' When he received the conse nt of his consort, Great Sophia, he revealed that first-begotten androgyne, who is called, 'First-begotten Son of God'. His female aspect is 'First- begotten Sophia, Mother of the Universe,' whom some call 'Love'. Now, First-begotten, since he has his authority from his father, created angels, myriads without number, for retinue. The whole multitude of those angels are called 'Assem bly of the Holy Ones, the Shadowless Lights. ' Now when these greet each other, their embrace s become like angels like themselves. First Begetter Father is called 'Adam of the Light.' And the kingdom of Son of Man is full of ineffable joy and unchanging jubilation, ever rejoicing in ineffable joy over their imperis hable - 1 3 5 -"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"glory, which has never been heard nor has it been revealed to all the aeons that came to be and their worlds. Then Son of Man consented with Sophia, his consort, and revealed a great androgynous Light. His masculine name is designated 'Savior, Begetter of All things'. His feminine name is designated 'Sophia, All-Begettress'. Some cal l her 'Pistis' (faith). Then Savior consent ed with his consort, Pistis Sophia, and reveale d six androgynous spiritua l beings who are the type of those who preceded them. Their male names are these: first, 'Unbegotte n'; second, 'Self-begotten'; third, 'Begetter'; fourth, 'First begette r'; fifth, 'All-begetter'; sixth, 'Arch-begetter'. Also the names of the females are these; first, 'All-wise Sophia'; second, 'All- Mother Sophia'; third, 'All-Begettress Sophia'; fourth, 'First Begettress Sophia'; fifth, 'Love Sophia'; sixth, 'Pistis Sophia'. From the conse nting of those I have just mentio ned, thoug hts appeared in the aeons that exist. From thoughts, reflectings; from reflectings, considerings; from considerings, rational ities, from rational ities, wills, from wi lls, words. Then the twelve powers, whom I have just discussed, consented with each other. <Six> males (and) females (each) were revealed, so that there are seventy-two powe rs. Each one of the seventy- two revealed five spiritual (powers), which (together) are the three hundred and sixty powers. The union of them all is the will. Theref ore our aeon came to be as the type of Immortal Man. Time came to be as the type of First Begette r, his son. The year came to be as the type of Savior. The twelve months came to be as the type of the twelve powers. The three hundred and sixty days of the year came to be as the three hundr ed and sixty powers who appeared from Savior. Their hours and moments came to be as the type of the angels who came from them (the powers), who are without number. And when those whom I have discussed appea red, All-Begett er, their father, very soon created twelve aeons for retinue for the twelve angels. And in each aeon there were six (heavens), so there are seventy-two heavens of the seventy- two powers who appeared from him. And in each of the heave ns there were five firmaments, so there are (altoget her) three hundred sixty firmam ents of the three hundred sixty powers that appeared from them. When the firmaments were complete, they were called 'The Three Hundred Sixty Heavens', according to the name of the heave ns that were before them. And all these are perfect and good. And in this way the defect of female ness appeared. The first aeon, then, is that of Immortal Man. The second aeon is that of Son of Man, who is called 'First Begetter' (\"who is called 'Savior'\" added in Codex V). That which embraces these is the aeon over which there is no kingdom, (the aeon) of the Eternal Infinite God, the aeon of the aeon of the immortals who are in it, (the aeon) above the Eighth that appe ared in chaos. Now Immortal Man reveal ed aeons and powers and kingdoms and gave author ity to everyone who appeared from him, to make whate ver they desire until the days that are above chaos. For these consented with each other and revealed every magnificence, even from spirit, multitud inous lights that are glorious and without number. These received names in the beginning, that is, the first, the middle, the perfect; that is, the first aeon and the second and the third. The first was called 'Unity and Rest'. Since each one has its (own) name, the <third> aeon was designated 'Assembly', from the great multitude that appear ed in the multitudinous one. Therefor e, when the multitude gathers and comes to a unity, they are called 'Assemb ly', from the Assem bly that surpassed heaven . Therefore, the Assembly of the Eighth was revealed as androgynous and was named partly as male and partly as female. The male was called 'Assembly', the female, 'Life', that it might be shown that from a female came the life in all the aeons. Every name was received, starting from the beginning. From his concurrence with his thought, the powers appeared who where called 'gods'; and the gods from their consider ings revealed divine gods; and the gods from their considerings revealed lords; and the lords of the lords from their words revealed lords; and the lords from their powers revealed archangels; the archan gels revealed angels; from <them, > the semblan ce appeared, with structure and form for naming all the aeons and their worlds. - 1 3 6 -"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"All the immortals, whom I have just described, have authority - all of them - from the power of Immor tal Man and Sophia, his consort, who was called 'Silence', who was named 'Silence' because by reflecting without speech she perfected her own majesty.

Some, Indeed, (who are) in dwellings and in chariots, being in ineffable glory and not able to be sent into any creature, provided for themselves hosts of angels, myriads without number for retinue and glory, even virgin spirits, the ineffable lights.

The revelat ion which Adam taught his son Seth in the seven hundreth year, saying: Listen to my words, my son Seth. When God had created me out of the earth, along with Eve, your mother, I went about with her in a glory which she had seen in the aeon from which we had come forth. She taught me a word of knowledge of the eternal God. And we resembled the great eternal angels, for we were higher than the god who had created us and the powe rs with him, whom we did not know. Then God, the ruler of the aeons and the powers, divided us in wrath. Then we became two aeons.

Then we recognized the God who had created us. For we were not strangers to his powers. And we served him in fear and slavery. And after these things, we became darkened in our heart(s ). Now I slept in the thoug ht of my heart. And I saw three men before me whose likeness I was unable to recognize, since they were not the powers of the God who had created us. They surpassed [...] glory, and [...] men [...] saying to me, \"Arise, Adam, from the sleep of death , and hear about the aeon and the seed of that man to whom life has come, who came from you a nd from Eve, your wi fe.\" When I had heard these words from the great men who were standing before me, then we sighed, I and Eve, in our heart(s). And the Lord, the God who had created us, stood before us. He said to us, \"Adam, why were you (both) sighing in your hearts? Do you not know that I am the God who created you? And I breathed into you a spirit of life as a living soul.\" Then darkness came upon our eyes. Then the God who created us, created a son from himse lf and Eve, your mother.

Then the angels and all the generations of the powers will use the name in error, asking, \"Where did it (the error) come from?\" or \"Where did the words of deception, which all the powe rs have failed to discover, come from?\" Now the first kingdom says of him that he came from [...].

We found a ship moored at the shore ready to embark, and we spoke with the sailors of the ship about our coming aboard with them. They showed great kindliness toward us as was ordained by the Lord. And after we had embarked, we sailed a day and a night. After that, a wind came up behind the ship and brought us to a small city in the midst of the sea. And I, Peter, inquired about the name of this city from residents who were standi ng on the dock.

There were four parts of his body that I saw: the soles of his feet and a part of his chest and the palms of his hands and his visage. These things I was able to see. A book cover like (those of) my books was in his left hand. A staff of styrax wood was in his right hand.

Others looked out from their upper windows. And they did not see (that they could gain) anything from him, because there was no pouch on his back nor bundle inside his cloth and napkin . And because of their disdain they did not even acknowledge him. He, for his part, did not reveal himself to them. They returned to their storerooms, saying, \"This man is mocking us.\" And the poor of that city heard his voice, and they came to the man who sells this pearl.

The one who carries bread with him on the road, the black dogs kill because of the bread. The one who carries a costly garment of the world with him, the robbers kill because of the garment. The one who carries water with him, the wolves kill because of the water, since they were thirsty for it. The one who is anxious about meat and green vegetables, the lions eat because of the meat.

So that in this way, the city of everyone who endures the burden of his yoke of faith will be inhabited, and he will be included in the kingdom of heaven.\" I hurried and went and called my friends so that we might go to the city that he, Lithargoe l, appointed for us. In a bond of faith we forsook everyth ing as he had said (to do). We evaded the robbers, because they did not find their garments with us. We evaded the wolves, because they did not find the water with us for which they thirsted. We evaded the lions, because they did not find the desire for meat wit h us. We evaded the bulls [...] they did not find green vegetables. A great joy came upon us and a peaceful carefreeness like that of our Lord. We rested ourselves in front of the gate, and we talked with each other about that which is not a distract ion of this world. Rather we conti nued in contemplation of the faith.

Our heads were bowed down in unworthiness as we said, \"What you wish we will do.

Do you not understand that my name, which you teach, surpasses all riches, and the wisdom of God surpasses gold, and silver and precious stone(s)?\" He gave them the pouch of medicine and said, \"Heal all the sick of the city who believe in my name.\" Peter was afraid to reply to him for the second time. He signaled to the one who was beside him, who was John: \"You talk this time.\" John answered and said, \"Lord, before you we are afraid to say many words. But it is you who asks us to practi ce this skill. We have not been taught to be physi cians. How then will we know how to heal bodies as you h ave told us?\" He answered them, \"Right ly have you spoken, John, for I know that the physi cians of this world heal what belongs to the world.

MacRae, Nag Hammadi Codices V,2-5 and VI with Papyr us Berolinensis 8502,1 and 4, ed. D. Parrot t, Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1979, 231-55, with critical reference to the English translations of G. W.

The poetic arrangement of the text is adapted from the translation of R. Unger , \"Zur sprachl ichen und formalen Struktur des gnostischen Textes 'Der Donner: der vollkommene Nous,'\" Oriens Christianus 59 (1975) 78-107. Thun der, Perfect Mind (NHC VI,2) presents the revelation discourse of a female divinity who speaks alternatel y in first- person statements of identity (\"I AM\") and second- person address. The text's parallelism of structure, togeth er with its extensive use of antithesis, paradox, and other literary devices, point clearly to its poetic or hymnic character. B. Layton has argued persuas ively that the parado xical and often outrageous pairing of antithetical terms in the \"I AM\" statements - 1 7 4 -"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"of Thunder can be read as a complex identity riddle to be solved by the knowing or \"gnostic\" reader. At the same time, attention to various features of the text as a whole sugges ts that it is not only the mystery of the speaker's identi ty, but the relation ship between the divine speake r and her human hearers that forms the exegetical crux of the text. Thund er focuses attention on the hearers' relationship to the divine speaker not only through its alternat ing structure of first-person proclamation and second-person address, but also throu gh its metaphor ical imager y of kinship and gender, its refere nces to the audience's responses to the divine, and its claims about the speake r's role in the operations of langu age and intellect. Its persist ent, uncompromisin g use of paradox pushe s its hearers to relinquish the apparent sense of its words and to seek the hidden meaning of individual utterances and of the discourse as a whole. Finally, by locating the divine in the \"voice\" and \"hearing\" of the text, it leads its hearers or readers to find the divine within the text and within themselves, and so to discover themselves within the divine. In such an interpretive movement of letting go and finding, of becoming sober and being found, the text's final words suggest, the reader \"goes up\" to the salvific \"place of rest,\" \"finds\" the di vine person a revealed in the text, and \"enters into\" a state of living and not dyin g again. Thund er's concep tion of salvation does not conform to the more familiar \"Gnos tic\" image of a transformative move ment or `conversion' from blindness to vision, deficiency to fullness, or ignorance to gnosis. Rather, Thund er presents an underst andin g of salvation that comes through the interpretive process of grappl ing with the language of the text and confronting the paradoxical nature of the divine within the antitheses of ignorance and gnosis, weakness and power, shame and honor, death and life. At the same time, Thunder forges a sharp distinction between those who merely hear the words of the text and those who hear the divine voice with gnosis, that is, between those who remain ignorant and those who come to know the divine in the fullness of her complexity and mystery. Those who hear the utterances of Thund er with gnosis enter into salvific relation with the divine through the interchan ge of divine utterance and divine hearing, manifested within the symbolic world of the text and within themselv es. \"Thunde r, Perfect Mind\" may thus be interprete d not only as a title for the text, but as a name for the divine speaker, her thunderi ng utterances, and her place of dwel ling within those who hear her voice and know her mystery with the salvific gnosis and hearing of perfe ct mind. Setting in Anc ient Medi terranean Re ligions While Thunder resembles many other ancient texts in various ways, its distinctive combination of features is virtually unmat ched in the religious and philosophical literature of antiquity. In form, Thunder's first-person proclamation s of identity (\"I AM\") parallel most directly the aretalo gies of the goddess Isis. Yet the text's altern ation between first-person identity statements and second-person address bring it closer to the form of the philosophical sermon or diatribe, familiar from the monologues of biblical Wisdom (e.g., Prov 8, Sir 24, Wis 7-8, 1 Enoch 42). In addition, Thunder combines these literary modes with rhetorical features, such as parado x and antithesis, which are more characteristic of the Greek riddle. In content as well as form, the closest parallels to Thunde r are found in the hymnic speeches of female divinities in other Nag Hammadi texts, espe cially those of Pronoia (in Ap. John II,1:30,11-31,28); Protennoi a (throughout Trim. Prot. XIII,1); Sophia Zoe, the \"Eve of Life\" (in Orig. World II,5:114,8-15); and the spiritual Eve in The Gospel of Eve (Epiph., Pan. 26.3.1). Yet unlike most of these divine discourses, the utterances of Thunder have no narrative or epistolary setting. They appe ar as unmediated divine speech, addressed directly from the divine to her huma n hearers or readers. There is no gener al scholarly consensus on the social or historical setting of Thunder. While scholars agree that the text exhib its no explicit ly Jewish or Christia n elements, its image ry resonate s with a variety of sourc es, including Jewish and Christian Wisdom, Isis traditions, Middle Platonism, Stoicism, and with other Nag Hammadi texts, especially those designated \"Sethian\" and \"Valentinian.\" Thunde r may profitably be read in relation to all of these texts and traditions as a revisiona ry poetic work that puts forward a distinctive perspective on the nature of the divine and her relation to huma nkind. Language, Date, Au thor , Provenance, and Manu script Thun der, Perfect Mind exists only in the Coptic version found at Nag Hammadi (NHC VI,2:13,1-21,32). The author, date, and place of composi tion are unknown, but a cultural milieu like that of second- or third-century Alexandria is plaus ible. In any case, it is clear that the text was originally composed in Greek well before 350 C.E., the approx imate date of the Coptic manusc ript. The surviving text is relatively well preserved, with minor damage near the top of the first four pages (13-16) and somewhat more serious dama ge on the first ten lines of the remaining manuscript pages (17- 21). - 1 7 5 -"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"A u t h o r i t a t i v e T e a c h i n g CODEX VI Translated by Ge orge W.

[...] in heaven [...] within him [...] anyone appears [...] the hidde n heave ns [...] appear, and before the invisible, ineffable worlds appeared. From these the invisible soul of righteousness came, being a fellow member, and a fellow body, and a fellow spirit. Whether she is in the descent or is in the Pleroma, she is not separated from them, but they see her and she looks at them in the invisible world. Secretl y her bridegroom fetched it. He presented it to her mouth to make her eat it like food, and he applied the word to her eyes as a medici ne to make her see with her mind and perceive her kinsme n and learn about her root, in order that she might cling to her branch from which she had first come forth, in order that she might receive what is hers and renounce matter.

In this very way, when the spiritual soul was cast into the body, it became a brother to lust and hatred and envy, and a material soul. So therefor e the body came from lust, and lust came from material substanc e. For this reason the soul became a brother to them. And yet they are outsiders, without power to inherit from the male, but they will inherit from their mother only. Whenever, therefore, the soul wishes to inherit along with the outsiders - for the possessions of the outsiders are proud passions, the pleasures of life, hateful envies, vainglorious things, nonsensical things, accusatio ns [...] for her [...] prostitutio n, he excludes her and puts her into the brothe l.

That one then will fall into drinking much wine in debauchery. For wine is the debauch er. Theref ore she does not remember her brothers and her father, for pleasure and sweet profits deceive her. Having left knowledge behind, she fell into bestiality. For a senseless person exists in bestiality, not knowing what is proper to say and what it is proper not to say.

For this reason she pursues the word and applies it to her eyes as a medic ine <open ing> them, castin g away [...] thought of a [...] blindness in [...] afterwards, when that one is again in ignoran ce, he is complete ly darkened and is material. Thus the soul [...] a word every hour, to apply it to her eyes as a medicine in order that she may see, and her light may conceal the hostile forces that fight with her, and she may make them blind with her light, and enclose them in her presence, and make them fall down in sleepless ness, and she may act boldly with her streng th and wit h her scepter. While her enemies look at her in shame, she runs upward into her treasure-house - the one in which her mind is - and (into) her storehouse which is secure, since nothing among the things that have come into being has seized her, nor has she received a stranger into her house. For many are her homeborn ones who fight against her by day and by night, having no rest by day or by night, for their lust oppresses them. For this reason, then, we do not sleep, nor do we forget the nets that are spread out in hiding, lying in wait for us to catch us. For if we are caught in a single net, it will suck us down into its mouth, while the water flows over us, strikin g our face. And we will be taken down into the dragnet, and we will not be able to come up from it, because the waters are high over us, flowing from above downward, submerging our heart down in the filthy mud. And we will not be able to escape from them. For man-eaters will seize us and swallow us, rejoicing like a fisherma n casting a hook into the water. For he casts many kinds of food into the water because each one of the fish has his own food. He smells it and pursue s its odor. But when he eats it, the hook hidden within the food seizes him and brings him up by force out of the deep waters. No man is able, then, to catch that fish down in the deep waters, except for the trap that the fisherman sets. By the ruse of food he brought the fish up on the hook. In this very way we exist in this world, like fish. The adversary spies on us, lying in wait for us like a fisherman, wishing to seize us, rejoicing that he might swallow us. For he places many foods before our eyes (things) which belong to this world. He wishes to make us desire one of them and to taste only a little, so that he may seize us with his hidden poison and bring us out of freedom and take us into slavery. For whenever he catches us with a single food, it is indeed necessary for us to des ire the rest. Final ly, then, such things become the food of death. Now these are the foods with which the devil lies in wait for us. First he injects a pain into your heart until you have heartache on account of a small thing of this life, and he seizes (you) with his poisons. And afterward (he injects) the desire of a tunic, so that you will pride yourself in it, and love of money, pride, vanity, envy that rivals another envy, beauty of body, fraudulence. The greatest of all these are ignorance and ease. Now all such things the adversary prepares beautifu lly and spreads out before the body, wishing to make the mind of the soul incline her toward one of them and overwhelm her, like a hook, drawin g her by force in ignorance, deceiving her until she conce ives evil, and bears fruit of matter, and conducts herself in uncleanness, pursuing many desires, covetous nesses, while fleshly pleasure draws her in ignorance. - 1 7 7 -"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"But the soul - she who has tasted these things - realized that sweet passions are transitory. She had learned about evil; she went away from them and she entered into a new conduct. Afterwards she despises this life, because it is transitory. And she looks for those foods that will take her into life, and leaves behind her those deceitful foods. And she learns about her light, as she goes about stripping off this world, while her true garment clothes her within, (and) her bridal clothing is placed upon her in beauty of mind, not in pride of flesh. And she learns about her depth and runs into her fold, while her shepherd stands at the door. In return for all the shame and scorn, then, that she received in this world, she receives ten thousand times the grace and glory. She gave the body to those who had given it to her, and they were ashamed, while the dealers in bodies sat down and wept because they were not able to do any busin ess with that body, nor did they find any (other) merchandise except it. They endured great labors until they had shaped the body of this soul, wishing to strike down the invisible soul. They were therefore ashamed of their work; they suffered the loss of the one for whom they had endured labors. They did not realize that she has an invisible spiritual body, thinking, \"We are her shepherd who feeds her.\" But they did not realize that she knows another way, which is hidde n from them. This her true shepherd taught her in knowledge. But these - the ones who are ignorant - do not seek after God. Nor do they inquire about their dwelling-place, which exists in rest, but they go about in bestiality. They are more wicked than the pagan s, because first of all they do not inquire about God, for their hardness of heart draws them down to make them their cruelty. Furthermore, if they find someone else who asks about his salvation, their hardness of heart sets to work upon that man. And if he does not stop asking, they kill him by their cruelty, thinking that they have done a good thi ng for themselves. Indeed they are sons of the devil! For even pagans give charit y, and they know that God who is in the heave ns exists, the Father of the universe, exalted over their idols, which they worship. But they have not heard the word, that they should inquire about his ways. Thus the senseless man hears the call, but he is ignorant of the place to which he has been called. And he did not ask during the preach ing, \"Where is the temple into which I should go and worship my hope?\" On accoun t of his senselessness, then, he is worse than a pagan, for the pagans know the way to go to their stone temple, which will perish, and they worship their idol, while their hearts are set on it because it is their hope. But to this senseless man the word has been preached, teaching him, \"Seek and inquire about the ways you should go, since there is nothing else that is as good as this thing.\" The result is that the substance of hardness of heart strikes a blow upon his mind, along with the force of ignorance and the demon of error. They do not allow his mind to rise up, because he was wearyi ng himse lf in seeking that he might learn about his hope. But the rational soul who (also) wearied herself in seeking - she learned about God. She labored with inquiring, endurin g distress in the body, wearing out her feet after the evangelists, learning about the Inscrutab le One. She found her rising. She came to rest in him who is at rest. She reclined in the bride-cham ber. She ate of the banquet for which she had hungered. She partook of the immortal food. She found what she had sought after. She received rest from her labors, while the light that shines forth upon her does not sink. To it belongs the glory and the power and the revelation for ever and ever. Amen.

I have given them as a service to the creation of the physi cal things, for it is not possib le for anyone to stand without that One, nor is it possible for the aeon to live without him. It is he who possesses what is in him by discerning (it) in purity. Then behold the Spirit and know where he is. He gave himself to men that they may receiv e life from him every day, since he has his life within him; he gives to them all. Then the darkness together with Hades took the fire. And he (the darkness) will release from himse lf what is mine. His eyes were not able to endure my light. After the spirits and the waters move d, the remainder came into being: the whole aeon of the creation, and their <powers> . The fire came forth from them and the Power came in the midst of the powers. And the powers desired to see my image. And the soul became its replica. This is the work that came into being. See what it is like, that before it comes into being it does not see, because the aeon of the flesh came to be in the great bodies. And there were apportioned to them long days in the creation. For when they had polluted themselves and had entered into the flesh, the father of the flesh, the water, avenged himsel f. For when he had found that Noah was pious (and) worthy - and it is the father of the flesh who holds the angels in subjection. And he (Noah) preached piety for one hundred and twenty years. And no one listened to him. And he made a wooden ark, and whom he had found entered it. And the flood took place. And thus Noah was saved with his sons. For if indeed the ark had not been meant for man to enter, then the water of the flood would not have come. In this way he intended (and) planned to save the gods and the angels, and the powers, the greatness of all of these, and the <nour ishment> and the way of life. And he moves them from the aeon (and) nourish es them in the permanent places. And the judgment of the flesh was unleashed. Only the work of the Pow er stood up. Next the psychic aeon. It is a small one, which is mixed with bodies, by begetti ng in the souls (and) defiling (them). For the first defilement of the creation found strength.

Then, in this aeon, which is the psychic one, the man will come into being who knows the great Power. He will receive (me) and he will know me. He will drink from the milk of the mother, in fact. He will speak in parables; he will proclaim the aeon that is to come, just as he spoke in the first aeon of the flesh, as Noah . Now concerning his words, which he uttered, he spoke in all of them, in seventy -two tongues. And he opened the gates of the heavens with his words. And he put to shame the ruler of Hades; he raised the dead, and he destroyed his domini on. Then a great disturbance took place. The archon s raised up their wrath against him. They wanted to hand him over to the ruler of Hades. Then they recog nized one of his followers. A fire took hold of his soul. He (Judas ?) handed him over, since no one knew him (Jesus?). They acted and seized him. They brought judgment upon themselves. And they delivered him up to the ruler of Hades. And they handed him over to Sasabek for nine bronze coins. He prepared himself to go down and put them to shame. Then the ruler of Hades took him. And he found that the nature of his flesh could not be seized, in order to show it to the archons. But he was saying: \"Who is this? What is it? His word has abolished the law of the aeon. He is from the Logos of the power of life.\" And he was victorious over the command of the archons, and they were not able by their work to rule over him. The archons searched after that which had come to pass. They did not know that this is the sign of their dissolution, and (that) it is the change of the aeon. The sun set during the day; that day became dark. The evil spirits were troubled. And after these things he will appear ascend ing. And the sign of the aeon that is to come will appear.

And they will reveal them, and they will become blessed, since they will come to know the truth. For you have found rest in the heavens.

How will men prepare themselves, and how will they be established, and how will they become indestructible aeons?

For when the semen reaches the climax, it leaps forth. In that moment, the female receives the strength of the male; the male, for his part, recei ves the strength of the female, while the semen does this. \"Therefor e, the mystery of intercourse is performed in secret, in order that the two sexes might not disgrace themsel ves in front of many who do not experience that reality. For each of them (the sexes) contributes its (own part in) begettin g. For if it happens in the presence of those who do not understand the reality, (it is) laugha ble and unbelievable. And, moreover, they are holy mysteries, of both words and deeds, because not only are they not heard, but also they are not seen. \"Therefor e, such people (the unbel ievers) are blasphemers. They are atheist ic and impious . But the others are not many; rather, the pious who are counted are few. Therefore, wickedness remains among (the) many, since learning concerning the things which are ordained does not exist among them. For the knowledge of the things which are ordained is truly the healing of the passions of the matter. Therefore, learning is something derived from knowledge. \"But if there is ignorance, and learning does not exist in the soul of man, (then) the incurable passions persist in it (the soul). And additio nal evil comes with them (the passions), in the form of an incurable sore. And the sore constantly gnaws at the soul, and through it the soul produces worms from the evil, and stinks. But God is not the cause of these things, since he sent to men know ledge and learning. \"Trismegistus, did he send them to men alone ?\" \"Yes, Asclepius, he sent them to them alone. And it is fitting that we tell you why to men alone he granted know ledge and learning, the allotment of his good. \"And now listen! God and the Father, even the Lord, created man subse quent to the gods, and he took him from the region of matter. Since matter is involved in the creatio n of man, of [...], the passions are in it. Therefore, they continually flow over his body, for this living creature would not have existed in any other way except that he had taken this food, since he is mortal. It is also inevitable that inoppor tune desires, which are harmfu l, dwell in him. For the gods, since they came into being out of a pure matter, do not need learning and knowledge. For the immorta lity of the gods is learning and know ledge, since they came into being out of pure matter. It (immortality) assumed for them the position of knowl edge and learni ng. By necessity, he (God) set a boun dary for man; he placed him in learn ing and knowl edge. \"Concerning these things (learning and knowledge) which we have mentioned from the beginning, he (God) perfected them in order that by means of these things he might restrain passions and evils, accord ing to his will. He brought his (man's) mortal existenc e into immortality; he (man ) became good (and) immortal, just as I have said.

And the perfect Majesty is at rest in the ineffable light, in the truth of the mother of all these, and all of you that attain to me, to me alone who am perfect, because of the Word. For I exist with all the greatness of the Spirit, which is a friend to us and our kindr ed alike, since I brought forth a word to the glory of our Father, through his goodn ess, as well as an imperishable thought; that is, the Word within him - it is slavery that we shall die with Christ - and an imperis hable and undef iled thoug ht, an incompreh ensible marvel, the writin g of the ineffable water which is the word from us.

Let us s end someone forth in it, just as he visited (the) Ennoias, the regions below. And I said these things to the whole multitude of the multitudinous assembly of the rejoicing Majesty. The whole house of the Father of Truth rejoiced that I am the one who is from them. I produced thought about the Ennoias which came out of the undefiled Spirit, about the descent upon the water, that is, the regions below. And they all had a single mind, since it is out of one. They charged me since I was willing. I came forth to reveal the glory to my kindred and my fel low spirits. For those who were in the world had been prepared by the will of our sister Sophia - she who is a whore - because of the innocence which has not been uttered. And she did not ask anything from the All, nor from the greatness of the Assemb ly, nor from the Pleroma. Since she was first, she came forth to prepare monads and places for the Son of Light and the fellow workers which she took from the elements below to build bodily dwellings from them. But, having come into being in an empty glory, they ended in destructio n in the dwellings in which they were, since they were prepared by Sophia. They stand ready to receive the life-giving word of the ineffable Monad and of the greatness of the asse mbly of all those who persev ere and those who are in me. I visited a bodily dwelling. I cast out the one who was in it first, and I went in. And the whole multitude of the archo ns became troubled.

I did not refuse them even to become a Christ, but I did not reveal myself to them in the love which was coming forth from me. I revealed that I am a stranger to the regions below. There was a great disturbance in the whole earthly area, with confusion and flight, as well as (in) the plan of the archons. And some were persuaded, when they saw the wonders which were being accomplished by me. And all these, with the race, that came down, flee from him who had fled from the throne to the Sophia of hope, since she had earlier given the sign concerning us and all the ones with me - those of the race of Adonaios. Others also fled, as if from the Cosmocrator and those with them, since they have brought every (kind of) punishment upon me.

And thus did their Ennoia come to be removed outside the Majesty of the heavens, i.e.,the Man of Truth, whose name they saw since he is in a small dwelling place, since they are small (and) sensele ss in their empty Enno ia, namely their laughter. It was contagion for them. The whole greatness of the Fatherhood of the Spirit was at rest in his places.

I was another upon Whom they placed the crown of thorns. But I was rejoicing in the height over all the wealth of the archo ns and the offspr ing of their error, of their empty glory. And I was laughing at their ignora nce. And I subjected all their powers. For as I came downw ard, no one saw me. For I was altering my shapes, changing from form to form. And therefore, when I was at their gates, I assumed their likeness. For I passed them by quietly, and I was viewing the places, and I was not afraid nor ashamed, for I was undefi led. And I was speaking with them, mingling with them through those who are mine, and trampli ng on those who are harsh to them with zeal, and quenching the flame. And I was doing all these things because of my desire to accompl ish what I desired by the will of the Father above.

For the soul, the one from the height, will not speak about the error which is here, nor transfer from these aeons, since it will be transfe rred when it becomes free and when it is endowed with nobility in the world, standing before the Father without weariness and fear, always mixed with the Nous of power (and) of form. They will see me from every side without hatred. For since they see me, they are being seen (and) are mixed with them. Since they did not put me to shame, they were not put to shame.

And they desire him and lead astray those, who through them have become like those who posses s the truth of their freedom , just as they bought us for servitude and constraint of care and fear. This person is in slavery. And he who is brought by constraint of force and threat has been guarded by God. But the entire nobility of the Fatherhood is not guarded, since he guards only him who is from him, without word and constra int, since he is united with his will, he who belongs only to the Ennoia of the Fatherhood, to make it Perfect and ineffable through the living water, to be with you mutually in wisdom , not only in word of hearin g but in deed and fulfilled word. For the perfect ones are worthy to be establ ished in this way and to be unite d with me, in order that they may not share in any enmity, in a good friendship. I accomplish everyth ing through the Good One, for this is the union of the truth, that they should have no adversary. But everyone who brings division - and he will learn no wisdom at all because he brings division and is not a friend - is hostile to them all. But he who lives in harmony and friendship of brother ly love, naturally and not artificially, completely and not partiall y, this person is truly the desire of the Father. He is the universal one and perfect love. For Adam was a laughingsto ck, since he was made a counterfeit type of man by the Hebdomad, as if he had become stronger than I and my brothers. We are innocent with respect to him, since we have not sinned. And Abraham and Isaac and Jacob were a laugh ingstock, since they, the counterfeit fathers, were given a name by the Hebdomad , as if he had become stronger than I and my brothers. We are innoc ent with respect to him, since we have not sinned.

Solomon was a laugh ingstock, since he thoug ht that he was Christ, having become vain through the Hebdomad, as if he had become stronger than I and my brothers.

They came into being as counterfeits throug h the Hebdomad, as if he had become strong er than I and my brothers. But we are innocent with respect to him, since we have not sinned.

For there is a great deception upon their soul, making it impossib le for them ever to find a Nous of freedom in order to know him, until they come to know the Son of Man. Now concerning my Father, I am he whom the world did not know, and because of this, it (the world) rose up against me and my brothers. But we are innocent with respect to him; we have not sinned. For the Archon was a laughingstock because he said, \"I am God, and there is none greater than I. I alone am the Father, the Lord, and there is no other beside me. I am a jealous God, who brings the sins of the fathers upon the children for three and four genera tions.\" As if he had become stronger than I and my brothers! But we are innocent with respect to him, in that we have not sinned, since we mastered his teaching. Thus he was in an empty glory. And he does not agree with our Father. And thus through our fellowship we grasped his teaching, since he was vain in an empty glory. And he does not agree with our Father, for he was a laugh ingstock and judgment and false prophec y. O those who do not see, you do not see your blindness, i.e., this which was not known, nor has it ever been known , nor has it been known about him. They did not listen to firm obedie nce. Theref ore they proceeded in a judgm ent of error, and they raised their defiled and murderous hands against him, as if they were beating the air. And the senseless and blind ones are always senseless, always being slaves of law and earthly fear. I am Christ, the Son of Man, the one from you who is among you. I am despised for your sake, in order that you yourselves may forget the difference. And do not become female, lest you give birth to evil and (its) brothers: jealousy and division, anger and wrath, fear and a divided heart, and empty, non -existent desire. But I am an ineffable mystery to you. Then before the foundation of the world, when the whole multitude of the Assemb ly came together upon the places of the Ogdoad, when they had taken counse l about a spiritua l wedding which is in union, and thus he was perfected in the ineffable places by a living word, the undef iled weddin g was consumm ated through the Mesotes of Jesus, who inhabits them all and possesses them, who abides in an undivided love of power. And surrounding him, he appears to him as a Monad of all these, a thought and a father, since he is one. And he stands by them all, since he as a whole came forth alone. And he is life, since he came from the Father of ineffable and perfect Truth , (the father) of those who are there, the union of Peace and a friend of good things, and life eternal and undefil ed joy, in a great harmony of life and faith, through eternal life of fatherhood and motherhood and sisterhood and rational wisdom . They had agreed with Nous, who stretch es out (and) will stretch out in joyful union and is trustworthy and faithfully listens to someone. And he is in fatherhood and motherh ood and rational brotherhood and wisdom. And this is a weddi ng of truth, and a repose of incorrupt ion, in a spirit of truth, in every mind, and a perfect light in an unnameab le mystery. But this is not, nor will it happen among us in any region or place in division and breach of peace, but (in) union and a mixture of love, all of which are perfected in the one who is. It also happened in the places under heaven for their recon ciliation. Those who knew me in salvation and undividedness, and those who existed for the glory of the father and the truth, having been separated, blended into the one through the living word. And I am in the spirit and the truth of the motherhood, just as he has been there; I was among those who are united in the - 1 9 5 -"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"friendship of friends forever, who neither know hostil ity at all, nor evil, but who are united by my Knowledge in word and peace which exists in perfect ion with everyone and in them all.

And all of these are one. And thus they will learn about the One, as (did) the Assembly and those dwelling in it. For the father of all these exists, being immeasurable (and) immutabl e: Nous and Word and Division and Envy and Fire. And he is entirely one, being the All with them all in a single doctrine, because all these are from a single spirit. O unse eing ones, why did you not know the mystery right ly? But the archon s around Yaldabaoth were disobedient because of the Ennoia who went down to him from her sister Sophia. They made for themsel ves a union with those who were with them in a mixture of a fiery cloud, which was their Envy, and the rest who were brought forth by their creatures, as if they had bruised the noble pleasure of the Assembly. And therefore they reveal ed a mixture of ignoran ce in a counterfeit of fire and earth and a murderer, since they are small and untaugh t, without knowledge having dared these things, and not having understood that light has fellowship with light, and darkness with darkness, and the corruptible with the perishable, and the imperis hable with the incorrupt ible. Now these things I have presented to you - I am Jesus Christ, the Son of Man, who is exalted above the heavens - O perfect and incorruptible ones, because of the incorrupt ible and perfect mystery and the ineffable one. But they think that we decreed them before the foundati on of the world, in order that, when we emerg e from the places of the world, we may present there the symbols of incorruptio n from the spiritual union unto knowledge. You do not know it, because the fleshly cloud overshad ows you. But I alone am the friend of Sophia.

As the Savior was sitting in the temple in the three hundredth (year) of the covenant and the agreement of the tenth pillar, and being satisfied with the number of the living, incorrupt ible Majesty, he said to me, \"Peter, blessed are those above belonging to the Father, who revealed life to those who are from the life, through me, since I reminded they who are built on what is strong, that they may hear my word, and distinguish words of unrighteousness and transgressio n of law from righteousn ess, as being from the height of every word of this Pleroma of truth, having been enlightened in good pleasure by him whom the principalities sought. But they did not find him, nor was he mentioned among any generation of the prophets . He has now appea red among these, in him who appeared, who is the Son of Man, who is exalted above the heavens in a fear of men of like essenc e. But you yoursel f, Peter, become perfect in accorda nce with your name with myself, the one who chose you, because from you I have established a base for the remnant whom I have summoned to knowledge. Therefore be strong until the imitatio n of righteousness - of him who had summoned you, havin g summoned you to know him in a way which is worth doing because of the rejection which happened to him, and the sinews of his hands and his feet, and the crowning by those of the middle region, and the body of his radiance which they bring in hope of service because of a reward of honor - as he was about to reprove you three times in this night.\" And as he was saying these things, I saw the priests and the people running up to us with stones, as if they w ould kill us; and I was afraid that we were going to die. And he said to me, \"Peter, I have told you many times that they are blind ones who have no guide. If you want to know their blindness, put your hands upon (your) eyes - your robe - and say what you see.\" But when I had done it, I did not see anything. I said \" No one sees (this way).\" Again he told me, \"Do it again.\" And there came in me fear with joy, for I saw a new light greater than the light of day. Then it came down upon the Savior. And I told him about those things which I saw. And he said to me again, \"Lift up your hands and listen to what the priests and the people are saying.\" And I listened to the priests as they sat with the scribes. The multitudes were shouting with their voice. When he heard these things from me he said to me, \"Prick up your ears and listen to the things they are saying.\" And I listened again, \"As you s it, they are praisin g you\". And when I said these things, the Savior said, \"I have told you that these (peopl e) are blind and deaf. Now then, listen to the things which they are telling you in a mystery, and guard them, Do not tell them to the sons of this age.

And those who say these things will ask about dreams. And if they say that a dream came from a demon worth y of their error, then they shall be given perditio n instead of incorruption.\" \"For evil cannot produce good fruit. For the place from which each of them is produces that which is like itself; for not every soul is of the truth, nor of immortal ity. For every soul of these ages has death assigned to it in our view, because it is always a slave, since it is created for its desires and their eternal destruction, in which they are and from which they are. They love the creatures of the matter w hich came forth with them.\" \"But the immortal souls are not like these, O Peter. But indeed, as long as the hour is not yet come, it (the immortal soul) shall resemb le a mortal one. But it shall not reveal its nature, that it alone is the immortal one, and thinks about immortality, having faith, and desiring to renounce these things.\" \"For people do not gather figs from thorns or from thorn trees, if they are wise, nor grapes from thistles. For, on the one hand, that which is always becoming is in that from which it is, being from what is not good, which becomes destruction for it and death. But that which comes to be in the Eternal One is in the One of the life and the immortality of the life which they resembl e.\" \"Therefor e all that which exists not will dissolv e into what exists not.

And in haught iness they shall grasp at pride, to envy the immortal soul which has become a pledge. For every author ity, rule, and power of the aeons wishes to be with these in the creatio n of the world, in order that those who are not, having been forgotten by those that are, may praise them, though they have not been saved, nor have they been brought to the Way by them, always wishing that they may become imperis hable ones.

And after the completi on of the error, the never-aging one of the immortal understand ing shall become young, and they (the little ones) shall rule over those who are their rulers.

But he who stands near him is the living Savior, the first in him, whom they seized and released, who stands joyfully lookin g at those who did him violence, while they are divided among themse lves.

But what they released was my incorporeal body. But I am the intellectual Spirit filled with radiant light. He whom you saw coming to me is our intellectual Pleroma, which unites the perfect light with my Holy Spirit.\" \"These things, then, which you saw you shall present to those of another race who are not of this age. For there will be no honor in any man who is not immortal, but only (in) those who were chosen from an immor tal substan ce, which has shown that it is able to contain him who gives his abundance. Therefore I said, 'Every one who has, it will be given to him, and he will have plenty.'

Oh wretched man, what will you do if you fall into their hands? Protect yourself, lest you be delivered into the hands of your enemies. Entrust yourself to this pair of friends, reason and mind, and no one will be victorious over you. May God dwell in your camp, may his Spirit protect your gates, and may the mind of Divinity protect the walls.

Therefore, foolish one, you should mourn for yourself. From now on, then, my son, return to your divine nature. Cast from you these evil, deceiving friends! Accept Christ, this true friend, as a good teacher. Cast from you death, which has become a father to you. For death did not exist, nor will it exist at the end. But since you cast from yourself God, the holy Father, the true Life, the Spring of Life, therefore you have obtained death as a father and have acquired ignora nce as a mother. They have robbed you of the true knowledge. But return, my son, to your first father, God, and Wisdom, your Mother, from whom you came into being from the very first in order that you might fight against all of your enemies, the Powers of the Adv ersary. Listen, my son, to my advice. Do not be arrogan t in oppos ition to every good opinio n, but take for yoursel f the side of the divinity of reason. Keep the holy commandments of Jesus Christ, and you will reign over every place on earth, and will be honored by the angels and archangels. Then you will acquire them as friends and fellow servants, and you will acquire places in heave n above. Do not bring grief and trouble to the divine which is within you. But w hen you w ill care for it, will reques t of it that you remain pure, and will become self-control led in your soul and body, you wil l become a throne of wisdom, and one belonging to God's household.

The body has come into being from the earth with an earthly substance, but the formed, for the sake of the soul, has come into being from the thoug ht of the Divine. The created, howe ver, is the mind, which has come into being in confor mity with the image of God.

For (if) it is difficult to find a psych ical man, how much more so to fi nd the Lord? But I say that God is the spiritual one. Man has taken shape from the substance of God. The divine soul shares partly in this one; furtherm ore, it shares partly in the flesh. The base soul is wont to turn from side to side, [...] which it images the truth. It is good for you, O man, to turn yourself toward the human, rather than toward the animal nature - I mean toward the fleshly.

For it is fitting for you to be in agreement with the intelligence of (these) two: with the intelligence of the snake and with the innocence of the dove - lest he (the Adversary) come into you in the guise of a flatterer, as a true frie nd, saying, \"I advise good things for you.\" But you did not recognize the deceitfu lness of this one whe n you received him as a true friend. For he casts into your heart evil thoughts as good ones, and hypocr isy in the guise of true wisdom, avidity in the guise of conservat ive frugal ity, love of glory in the guise of that which is beautiful , boastfulness and pride in the guise of great austerity, and godlessness as great godliness. For he who says, \"I have many gods,\" is godless. And he casts spurious knowledge into your heart in the guise of mysterious words. Who will be able to comprehen d his thoughts and devices, which are varied, since he is a Great Mi nd for those who wish to accept him as king ? My son, how will you be able to comprehe nd the schemes of this one, or his soul-killing counse l? For his devices, and the schemes of his wickedness, are many. And think about his entranc es, that is, how he will enter your soul, and in what garment he wi ll enter you. Accept Christ, who is able to set you free, and who has taken on the devices of that one, so that through these he might destroy him by deceit. For this is the king whom you have who is forever invincible, against whom no one will be able to fight nor say a word. This is your king and your father, for there is no one like him. The divine teacher is with you always. He is a helper, and he meets you because of the good which is in you. Do not put maliciousness in your judgment, for every malicious man harms his heart. For only a foolish man is wont to his destruction, but a wise man knows his way. And a foolish man does not guard against speaking (a) mystery: A wise man (however) does not blurt out every word, but he will be discriminating toward those who hear. Do not mentio n everything in the presence of those whom you do not know. - 2 0 2 -"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Have a great numbe r of friends, but not counselors. First, examine your counselor, for do not honor anyone who flatters. Their word, to be sure, is sweet as honey, but their heart is full of hellebore. For whenever they think that they have become a reliable friend, then they will deceitf ully turn against you, and they will cast you down into the mire. Do not trust anyone as a friend, for this whole world has come into being deceitfu lly, and every man is trouble d in vain. All things of the world are not profita ble, but they happen in vain. There is no one, not even a brother (who is trustworthy ), since each one is seeking his own advantage. My son, do not have anyone as a friend, but if you do acquire one, do not entrust yourself to him. Entrust yoursel f to God alone as father and as friend. For everyone proceeds deceitfully, while the whole earth is full of suffer ing and pain - things in which there is no profit. If you wish to pass your life in quiet, do not keep company with anyone. And if you do keep company with them, be as if you do not. Be pleasing to God, and you will not need anyone. Live with Christ and he will save you. For he is the true ligh t and the sun of life. For just as the sun which is visible and makes light for the eyes of the flesh, so Christ illuminates every mind and the heart. For (if) a wicked man (who is) in the body (has) an evil death , how much more so (does) he who has his mind blind. For every blind man goes along in such a way that he is seen just as one who does not have his mind sane. He does not deligh t in acquiring the light of Christ, which is reason. For everything which is visible is a copy of that which is hidde n. For as a fire which burns in a place without being confined to it, so it is with the sun which is in the sky, all of whose rays extend to places on the earth. Similarly, Christ has a sing le being, and he gives light to eve ry place. This is also the way in which he speaks of our mind, as if it were a lamp which burns and lights up the place. (Bein g) in a part of the soul, it gives light to all the parts. Furtherm ore, I shall speak of what is more exalted than this: the mind, with respect to actual being, is in a place, which means it is in the body; but with respect to thought, the mind is not in a place. For how can it be in a place, when it contemplates every place ? But we are able to mentio n what is more exalted than this: for do not think in your heart that God exists in a place. If you localize the Lord of all in a place, then it is fitting for you to say that the place is more exalted than he who dwells in it. For that which contains is more exalted than that which is contained. For th ere is no place which is called incorporeal. For it is not right for us to say that God is corporeal. For the conse quence (would be) that we (must) attribute both increase and decrease to the corporeal, but also that he (God) who is subject to these will not remain imperishable. Now, it is not difficult to know the Creator of all creatures, but it is impossible to comprehend the likeness of this One. For it is difficult not only for men to comprehe nd God, but it is (also) difficult for every divine being, (both) the angels and the archangels. It is necessary to know God as he is. You cannot know God through anyone except Christ, who has the image of the Father, for this image reveals the true likeness in correspond ence to that which is reveale d. A king is not usually known apart from an image. Consi der these things about God: he is in every place; on the other hand, he is in no place. With respect to power, to be sure, he is in every place; but with respect to divinity, he is in no place. So then, it is possible to know God a little. With respect to his power, he fills every place, but in the exaltation of his divinity, nothi ng contains him. Everythi ng is in God, but God is not in anything. Now what is it to know God? God is all which is in the truth. But it is as impossible to look at Christ as at the sun. God sees everyone; no one looks at him. But Christ, without being jealous, receives and gives. He is the Light of the Father, as he gives light without being jealous. In this mann er he gives light to every place. And all is Christ, he who has inherited all from the Existent One. For Christ is the idea of incorrupti bility, and he is the Light which is shining undef iled. For the sun (shines) on every impure place, and yet it is not defiled. So it is with Christ: even if he is in the deficiency, yet he is without deficiency. And even if he has been begotten, he is (still) unbegotten. So it is with Christ: - 2 0 3 -"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"if, on the one hand, he is comprehen sible, on the other, he is incompre hensible with respect to his actual being. Christ is all. He who does not posse ss all is unable to know Christ. My son, do not dare to say a word about this One, and do not confine the God of all to mental images. For he who condemns may not be condemned by the one who condemns. Indeed, it is good to ask and to know who God is. Reason and mind are male names. Indeed, let him who wishes to know about this One, quietly and reverently ask. For there is no small danger in speaking about these things, since you know that you will be judged on the basis of everythi ng that you say. And understand by this that he who is in darkness will not be able to see anything unless he receives the light and recovers (his) sight by means of it. Examine yourself (to see) whether you wholly have the light, so that, if you ask about these things, you may understand how you will escape. For many are seeking in darkness, and they grope about, wishing to understand, since there is no light for them. My son, do not allow your mind to stare downward, but rather, let it look by means of the light at things above. For the light will always come from above. Even if it (the mind) is upon the earth, let it seek to pursue the things above. Enlighten your mind with the light of heave n, so that you may turn to the light of heave n. Do not tire of knock ing on the door of reason, and do not cease walking in the way of Christ. Walk in it so that you may receive rest from your labors. If you walk in another way, there will be no profit in it. For also those who walk in the broad way will go down at their end to the perdition of the mire. For the Underworld is open wide for the soul, and the place of perdition is broad. Accept Christ, the narrow way. For he is oppressed and bears affliction for your s in. O soul, persistent one, in what ignorance you exist! For who is your guide into the darkness? How many likenesses did Christ take on because of you! Although he was God, he was found among men as a man. He descended to the Underworld. He released the children of death . They were in travai l, as the scripture of God has said. And he sealed up the (very) heart of it (the Underworld). And he broke its (the Underwo rld's) strong bows complete ly. And when all the powers had seen him, they fled, so that he might bring you, wretched one, up from the Abyss, and might die for you as a ransom for your sin. He saved you from th e strong hand of the Underwo rld. But you, yourself, difficult (thoug h it be) give to him your fundamenta l assent with (even so much as) a hint that he may take you up with joy! Now the fundament al choice, which is humility of heart, is the gift of Christ. A contrite heart is the acceptab le sacrifice. If you humble yourself, you will be greatly exalted; and if you exalt yourself, you w ill be exceedin gly humble d. My son, guard yourself against wickedness, and do not let the Spirit of Wickedness cast you down into the Abyss. For he is mad and bitter. He is terrifying, and he casts everyone down into a pit of mire. It is a great and good thing not to love fornication, and not even to think of the wretch ed matter at all, for to think of it is death. It is not good for any man to fall into death. For a soul which has been found in death will be without reason. For it is better not to live than to acquire an animal's life. Protect yoursel f, lest you are burned by the fires of fornication. For many who are submerged in fire are its servants, whom you do not know as your enemies. O my son, strip off the old garment of fornication, and put on the garment which is clean and shining, that you may be beauti ful in it. But when you have this garment, protect it well. Release yoursel f from every bond, so that you may acquire freedom. If you cast out of yourself the desire whose devices are many, you will release yourself from th e sins of lust. Listen, O soul, to my advice. Do not become a den of foxes and snakes, nor a hole of serpents and asps, nor a dwelling place of lions, or a place of refuge of basilisk-snakes. When these things happen to you, O soul, what will you do? For these are the powe rs of the Adversary. Everyth ing which is dead will come into you through them (the powe rs). For their food is everything which is dead, and every unclean thing. For when these are within you, what living thing will come into you? The living angels will detest you.

Entrust yoursel f to this one who became all for your sake. Knock on yourself as upon a door, and walk upon yourself as on a straight road. For if you walk on the road, it is impossible for you to go astray. And if you knock with this one (Wisdom ), you knock on hidden treasures. For since he (Christ) is Wisdom, he makes the foolish man wise. He (Wisdom ) is a holy kingd om and a shining robe. For it (Wisdom ) is much gold, which gives you great honor. The Wisdom of God became a type of fool for you, so that it might take you up, O foolish one, and make you a wise man. And the Life died for you when he was powerless, so that through his death, he might give life to you who have died. Entrust yourself to reason and remove yourself from anima lism. For the anima l which has no reason is made mani fest. For many think that they have reason, but if you look at them attentively, their speech is animalistic. Give yourself gladness from the true vine of Christ. Satisfy yourself with the true wine, in which there is no drunkenness nor error. For it (the true wine) marks the end of drink ing, since there is usually in it what gives joy to the soul and the mind, through the Spirit of God. But first, nurture your reasoni ng powe rs before you drink of it (the true wine). Do not pierce yourself with the sword of sin. Do not burn yourself, O wretched one, with the fire of lust. Do not surrender yourself to barbarians like a prisoner, nor to savage beasts which want to trample upon you. For they are as lions which roar very loudly. Be not dead lest they trample upon you. You shall be man! It is possibl e for you throug h reasoni ng to conquer them. But the man who does nothing is unworth y of (being called) rational man. The rational man is he who fears God. He who fears God does nothing insolent. And he who guards himse lf against doing anyth ing insolent is one who keeps his guiding principle.

But he who makes himse lf like God is one who does nothing unworthy of God, accord ing to the statement of Paul, who has become like Christ. For who shows reverence for God while not wanting to do things which are pleasin g to him? For piety is that which is from the heart, and piety from the heart (characterizes) every soul which is near to God. The soul which is a member of God's househol d is one which is kept pure, and the soul which has put on Christ is one which is pure. It is impossi ble for it to sin. Now where Christ is, there sin is idle. Let Christ alone enter your world, and let him bring to naught all powers which have come upon you. Let him enter the temple which is within you, so that he may cast out all the mercha nts. Let him dwell in the temple which is within you, and may you become for him a priest and a Levite, entering in purity. Blessed are you, O soul, if you find this one in your temple. Blessed are you still more if you perform his service. But he who will defile the temple of God, that one God will destroy. For you lay yourself open, O man, if you cast this one out of your temple .

And yet, the divine Word is God, he who bears patiently with man always. He wished to produce humility in the exalted. He (Christ), who has exalted man became like God, not in order that he might bring God down to man, but that man might become like God. O this great goodness of God!

If we have not even been able to understand the counse ls of our companions, who will be able to compr ehend the Divinity, or the divinities of the heavens? If we scarcely find things on earth, who will search for the things of heave n? A great powe r and great glory has made the world known .

He alone was begotten by the Father's good pleasure. For he is an incompre hensible Word, and he is Wisdom and Life. He gives life to, and nourish es, all living things and powers. Just as the soul gives life to all the members, he rules all with power and gives life to them. For he is the beginning and the end of everyone, watching over all and encompassi ng them.

Therefore, he bears many forms. When he turns aside, he comes into being seeking those things that do not exist.

The Letter of Peter which he sent to Philip \"Peter, the apostl e of Jesus Christ, to Philip, our beloved brother and our fellow apostle, and (to) the brethre n who are wit h you: greetings! Now I want you to know, our brother, that we received orders from ou r Lord and the Savior of the whole world that we should come together to give instru ction and preach in the salvation which was promised us by our Lord Jesus Christ. But as for you, you were separate from us, and you did not desire us to come together and to know how we should organize oursel ves in order that we might tell the good news. Therefore would it be agreeable to you, our brother, to come according to the orders of our God Jesus?\" When Philip had received these (words), and when he had read them, he went to Peter rejoicing with gladness. Then Peter gathered the others also. They went upon the mountain which is called \"the (mount ) olives,\" the place where they used to gather with the blessed Christ when he was in the body. Then, when the apostl es had come together, and had thrown themselv es upon their knees , they prayed thus saying, \"Father, Father, Father of the light, who possesses the incorruptions, hear us just as thou hast taken pleasure in thy holy child Jesus Christ. For he became for us an illuminator in the darkness. Yea h ear us!\" And they prayed again another time, saying, \"Son of life, Son of immortal ity, who is in the light, Son, Christ of immortality, our Redeemer, give us power, for they seek to kil l us!\" Then a great light appear ed so that the mountai ns shone from the sight of him who had appeared. And a voice called out to them saying, \"Listen to my words that I may speak to you. Why are you asking me? I am Jesus Christ who am wit h you forever.\" Then the apostles answered and said, \"Lord, we would like to know the deficiency of the aeons and their pleroma.\" And: \"How are we detained in this dwelling place?\" Further: \"How did we come to this place?\" And: \"In what mann er shall we depart?\" Again: \"How do we have the authority of boldness?\" And: \"Why do the powers fight against us?\" Then a voice came to them out of the light saying, \"It is you yourselves who are witnesses that I spoke all these things to you. But because of your unbelief I shall speak again. First of all concerning the deficiency of the aeons, this is the deficiency, when the disob edience and the foolishness of the mother appeared without the command ment of the majesty of the Father. She wanted to raise up aeons. And when she spoke, the Arrogant One followed. And when she left behind a part, the Arrogant One laid hold of it, and it became a deficiency. This is the deficiency of the aeons. Now when the Arrogant One had taken a part, he sowed it. And he placed powers over it and authorit ies. And he enclosed it in the aeons which are dead. An d all the pow ers of the world rejoiced that they had been begotten. But they do not know the pre-existent Father, since they are strangers to him. But this is the one to whom they gave power and whom they served by praising him. But he, the Arrogant One, became proud on accou nt of the praise of the powe rs. He became an envier and he wanted to make an image in the place of an image, and a form in the place of a form. And he commissioned the powers within his authority to mold mortal bodies. And they came to be from a misrepresentation, from the semblance which had merged.\" \"Next conce rning the pleroma: I am the one who was sent down in the body because of the seed which had fallen away. And I came down into their mortal mold. But they did not recogni ze me; they were thinking of me that I was a mortal man.

When you strip off from yourselves what is corrupted, then you wi ll become illuminators in the m idst of mortal men.\" \"And this (is the reason) that you will fight against the powers, because they do not have rest like you, since they do not wish that you be saved.\" Then the apostles worshiped again saying, \"Lord, tell us: In what way shall we fight against the archon s, since the archo ns are above us?\" Then a voice called out to them from the appearance saying, \"Now you will fight against them in this way, for the archons are fighting against the inner man. And you are to fight against them in this way: Come together and teach in the world the salvation with a promise. And you, gird yoursel ves with the power of my Father, and let your prayer be know n. And he, the Father, will help you as he has helped you by sending me. Be not afraid, I am with you forever, as I previous ly said to you when I was in the body.\" Then there came lightning and thunder from heave n, and what appeared to them in that place was taken up to heaven . Then the apostles gave thanks to the Lord with every blessi ng. And they return ed to Jerusalem. And while coming up they spoke with each other on the road conce rning the light which had come. And a remark was made concerning the Lord. It was said, \"If he, our Lord, suffered, then how much (must) we (suffer)?\" Peter answered saying, \"He suffered on our behalf, and it is necessary for us too to suffer because of our smallness.\" Then a voice came to them saying, \"I have told you many times: it is necessary for you to suffer. It is necessary that they bring you to synagogues and governors, so that you will suffer. But he who does n ot suffer and does not [...] the Father [...] in order that he may [...].\" And the apostl es rejoiced greatly and came up to Jerusale m. And they came up to the temple and gave instru ction in salvation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And they healed a multitude. And Peter opened his mouth, he said to his (fellow) disciples, \"Did our Lord Jesus, when he was in the body, show us everything? For he came down. My brothers, listen to my voice.\" And he was filled with a holy spirit. He spoke thus: \"Our illuminator, Jesus, came down and was crucified. And he bore a crown of thorns. And he put on a purple garment. And he was crucified on a tree and he was buried in a tomb. And he rose from the dead. My brothers, Jesus is a stranger to this suffering. But we are the ones who have suffered through the transgressio n of the mother. And because of this, he did everything like us. For the Lord Jesus, the Son of the immeasura ble glory of the Father, he is the author of our life. My brothers, let us therefore not obey these lawless ones, and walk in [...].\" [...] Then Peter gathered together the others also, saying, \"O, Lord Jesus Christ, author of our rest, give us a spirit of understandi ng in order that we also may perform wonders.\" Then Peter and the other apostles saw him, and they were filled with a holy spirit, And each one performed healings. And they parted in order to preach the Lord Jesus. And they came together and greeted each other saying, \"Amen .\" Then Jesus appeared saying to them, \"Peace to you all and everyone who believes in my name. And when you depart, joy be to you and grace and powe r. And be not afraid; behol d, I am with you forever. \" Then the apostles parted from each other into four words in order to preach.

Father of All, Ennoia 22 of the Light, dwelling in the heights above the (regions) below, Light dwelling in the heights, Voice of Truth, upright Nous 23 , untouchable Logos 24 , and ineffable Voice, incomprehensible Fathe r! 25 It is Nore a 26 who cries out to them. 27 They heard, (and) they received her into her place forever. They gave it to her in the Father of Nous, A damas 28 , as well as the voice of the Holy Ones, in order that she might rest in the ineffabl e Epinoia 29 , in order that <she> might inherit the first mind 30 which <she> had received, and that <she> might rest in the divine Autogene s 31 , and that she (too) might gener ate herself, just as she also has inherited the living Logos 32 , and that she might be joined to all of the Imperish able Ones, and speak with the min d of the Fathe r. 33 And she began to speak with the words of Life 34 , and <she> remai ned in the presence of the Exalted One, possessing that which she had received before the world came into being 35 . She has the great mind of the Invisible One, and she gives glory to <her> F ather, and she dwells within those who [...] within the Pleroma 36 , and she beholds the Pleroma. 37 There will be days when she will behold the Pleroma, and she will not be in deficiency 38 , for she has the four holy helpers 39 who intercede on her behalf with the Father of the All, Adamas. He it is who is within all of the Adams 40 , possessing the thought of Norea, who speaks concerning the two names which create a single name. 22 Enn oi a is the Greek word for thought. 23 No u s is the Greek word for Mind. In Hermetic and Gnostic writings, Nous often is used as a name or a description of the one true God. 24 Lo go s is the Greek word often translate d into English as Word. In the original Greek it is more of a reference to ratio, order, or logic, although language (hence 'word') is also a valid choice. Logos, in Christological writings is usually assumed to refer to Christ. This assumpti on, however, is drawn into question when one observes the use of the word in the Hermetic and non-Christia n Gnostic traditions, as \"The Thought of Norea\" is an example of. It should be read as the saving logic, or knowle dge (gnosis) by which salvation is achieve d. 25 This part begins the Thought with an address to higher beings, formed as an invocation. Although Pearson details it as being to the divine Sethian triad of Father, Mother and Son, this does not seem so clear. Clearly more than one being is addressed , as Norea refers to \"them\" in line 3, and clearly the Son is addressed (\"Logos,\" line 2) and the Father (\"Nous,\" line 2), but presu mably the Ennoia and/or the Voice is meant to refer to the divine Mother. 26 Nor ea , under many variations of spelling, is a frequent figure in Gnostic literature (cf. especially The Hypostasis of the Archons), under a great variety of circumstances, from the ark burning wife of Noah to the sister-wife of Seth. In this last capacity, in Sethian Gnosticism , she often appears as a female equivalent of his mal e savior figure . Here, however, she takes th e positio n of savior alone. 27 Begins the secon d segment in the Thought, where Norea is taken from this world into the divine world (the Pleroma), being her proper place. It is telling in that the higher powers do not receive her into their place, but into hers. She is brought into the thought of the mind, and there can speak with all the Imperishable Ones, being the higher powers themselves and all the saved. We see that she has inherited the Logos, which a Christian would read as receiving the Spirit of the Word, Christ, and she also becomes Autogenetic. Thus she, so to speak, is taken into the Godhead. 28 Identified as \"the Father of the All\" and \"the Father of Nous\" (or mind), Ad am as is a name often used to refer to the father of all mankind. One will notice, though, that, unlike the Bringhamite Mormons, this does not imply that a man, Adam, is the father of all, or the father of God (Nous), for Adamas is present in all that Adams (see note, line 20). This is, inste ad, a transcen dent being, a totality of thoughts, by which salvation is achieved, roughly equivalent to the Christian Holy Spirit. 29 Epin oi a : Although this annotator does not know from what Greek word this is d erived, it evide ntly refers to the Pleroma once again, wherein Norea may find rest. 30 F ir st mind : refers once again to the Nous, being the first min d of God. The significance is that it points out once again that she has inherited the very mind of God. 31 Auto g en es is the Greek word meaning \"self-begotten,\" in that the Creator is self-creating, and needs no external force to bring Him into being. In Hermetic and Gnostic writings it is often used as an alternate name for the one true God. The significance here is that, having been freed from the bonds of this corruptible world, Norea becom es \"self-begotten,\" able to generate herself, showing the immor tality of the soul and the fact th at the appearance of creation is misleading. 32 Livi n g L og os : in Gnostic texts, the term \"Living Christ\", as opposed to simply \"Christ,\" is used to refer to the secret or spiritual being, as opposed to the earthly or corruptible being. The use here may be construe d as to refer to the immort al and spiritual Logos (note 3), as opposed to the Logos that manifests itself in the world which we may perceive. Norea has, thus, inherited the true knowle dge of reality, not simply earthly knowledge as can be studied from experiences here on this plane. 33 Part three: She has here received the very min d of God into herself, and simulta neously sees and is the Godhead, or Pleroma. 34 Wor d s o f Lif e : Here, Pearson conjectu res that the words of Life refer to the capacity to deliver salvation, and thus shows that Norea achieves the capacity to save mankind by virtue of her salvation. 35 \"that which she had received before the world came into being\": refers to the immortality of the soul, and the concept that the soul, although it may believe or perceive itself to be apart from the Pleroma, in reality has received the mind of God (note 12), the living Logos, and the words of Life before this corrupti ble world came into being. 36 P le ro m a : The Pleroma is the word referring to the thirty highest Aeons, constitutin g the one true God, although it also refers to the beings that occupy those Aeons. This is how Norea may simultaneously see and be the Pleroma. Essentially, this word means what is thought of as the Godhead in Eastern culture. 37 Fourth and final section of the Thought, wherein it speaks of Norea's salvation, and how it is aided. 38 D e fi cie n c y : The concept of being in or out of deficiency is a commo n one in Gnostic writings, and refers to being filled or not filled with the spirit of God (or, among Christia n Gnostics, Christ). One who is not filled with the spirit of God is deficie nt, and thirsts, and is not saved. The Norea perce ives the Pleroma and is not deficie nt demonstrates that being one with the Godhead is salvation, and fills one with the spirit. 39 Fo ur ho l y help e rs : Pearson identifies these helpers with the four \"luminaries\" of Sethian Gnosticism, Harmozel, Oroiael, Daveithe, and Eleleth. These beings are more detailed in Melchized ek, where it is seen that they are referre d to as \"commander\" or \"Commander-in-chief,\" and seem to fulfill a position some what similar to the Archangels in Christia nty, although Melchizedek groups the \"offspring of the Archons\" with the offsprin g of \"all the angels,\" and so the luminaries may be of a higher type. Here they are seen as entities aiding by inter cession in Norea's contin ual salvation, thus implying that salvation is some thing that can be lost. 40 Ad a m s : Adam being the Hebrew for \"man,\" should be read as meaning the reference here to the Adams as the mass of created humanity. That Adamas is present in all Adams shows that the transcendent totality of thoughts is presen t in all created mankin d. - 2 3 3 -"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"T h e T e s t i m o n y o f T r u t h CODEX IX Translate d by Søren Giversen and Birger A.

I will speak to those who know to hear not with the ears of the body but with the ears of the mind. For many have sought after the truth and have not been able to find it; because there has taken hold of them the old leaven of the Pharisees and the scribes of the Law. And the leaven is the errant desire of the angels and the demons and the stars. As for the Pharisees and the scribes, it is they who belon g to the archo ns who have authority over them. For no one who is under the Law will be able to look up to the truth, for they will not be able to serve two masters. For the defilement of the Law is manifest; but undefilement belongs to the light. The Law commands (one) to take a husba nd (or) to take a wife, and to beget, to multi ply like the sand of the sea. But passion, which is a deligh t to them, constrai ns the souls of those who are begotten in this place, those who defile and those who are defiled, in order that the Law might be fulfilled through them. And they show that they are assisting the world; and they turn away from the light, who are unable to pass by the archon of darkness until they pay the last penny. But the Son of Man came forth from Imperishability, being alien to defilement. He came to the world by the Jordan river, and immediate ly the Jordan turned back. And John bore witness to the descent of Jesus. For it is he who saw the power which came down upon the Jordan river; for he knew that the dominion of carnal procreatio n had come to an end. The Jordan river is the power of the body, that is, the senses of pleasures. The water of the Jordan is the desire for sexual intercourse. John is the archon of the womb. And this is what the Son of Man reveals to us: It is fitting for you (pl.) to receive the word of truth, if one will receive it perfectl y. But as for one who is in ignoran ce, it is difficult for him to diminish his works of darkness which he has done. Those who have known Imperisha bility, however, have been able to struggle against passions [...]. I have said to you, \"Do not build nor gather for yoursel ves in the place where the brigands break open, but bring forth fruit to the Father.\" The foolish - thinking in their heart that if they confess, \"We are Christians,\" in word only (but) not with power, while giving themse lves over to ignorance, to a human death , not knowing where they are going nor who Christ is, thinking that they will live, when they are (really) in error - hasten towards the principalities and authorities.

And he gave comman d to himsel f; he began to know himself and to speak with his mind, which is the father of the truth, concerning the unbegotten aeons, and concerning the virgin who brought forth the light. And he thinks about the power which flowed over the whole place, and which takes hold of him. And he is a disciple of his mind, which is male. He began to keep silent within himse lf until the day when he should become worthy to be received above. He rejects for himse lf loquac ity and disputatio ns, and he endures the whole place; and he bears up under them, and he endures all of the evil things.

This, therefore, is the true testimon y: When man comes to know himsel f and God, who is over the truth, he will be saved, and he will crown himsel f with the crown unfading. John was begotten by the World through a woman, Elizab eth; and Christ was begotten by the world throug h a virgin, Mary. What is (the mean ing of) this mystery? John was begotten by means of a womb worn with age, but Christ passed through a virgin's womb. When she had conceived, she gave birth to the Savior. Furtherm ore, she was found to be a virgin again. Why, then do you (pl.) err and not seek afte r these mysteries, which were prefigured for our sake? It is written in the Law concerning this, when God gave a comma nd to Adam, \"From every tree you may eat, but from the tree which is in the midst of Paradise do not eat, for on the day that you eat from it, you will surely die.\" But the serpent was wiser than all the animals that were in Paradise, and he persuaded Eve, saying, \"On the day when you eat from the tree which is in the midst of Paradise, the eyes of your mind will be opened. \" And Eve obeyed, and she stretched forth her hand; she took from the tree and ate; she also gave to her husban d with her. And immediate ly they knew that they were naked, and they took some fig-leaves (and) put them on as girdles. But God came at the time of evening, walki ng in the midst of Paradise. When Adam saw him, he hid himself. And he said, \"Adam, where are you?\" He answered (and) said, \"I have come under the fig tree.\" And at that very moment, God knew that he had eaten from the tree of which he had commanded him, \"Do not eat of it.\" And he said to him, \"Who is it who has instructed you?\" And Adam answered, \"The woman whom you have given me.\" And the woman said, \"It is the serpent who instructed me.\" And he (God) cursed the serpent, and called him \"devil.\" And he said, \"Behold, Adam has become like one of us, know ing evil and good.\" Then he said, \"Let us cast him out of paradise, lest he take from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.\" - 2 3 6 -"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"But what sort is this God? First he maliciously refused Adam from eating of the tree of know ledge, and, secon dly, he said \"Adam, where are you?\" God does not have foreknowledge? Would he not know from the beginning? And afterwards, he said, \"Let us cast him out of this place, lest he eat of the tree of life and live forever.\" Surely, he has shown himse lf to be a malicious grudger! And what kind of God is this? For great is the blindness of those who read, and they did not know him. And he said, \"I am the jealous God; I will bring the sins of the fathers upon the children until three (and) four generations.\" And he said, \"I will make their heart thick, and I will cause their mind to become blind, that they might not know nor compr ehend the things that are said.\" But these things he has said to those who believe in him and serve him! And in one place, Moses writes, \"He made the devil a serpent <for> those whom he has in his generation .\" Also, in the book which is called \"Exodus,\" it is written thus: \"He contended against the magicians, when the place was full of serpents according to their wickedness; and the rod which was in the hand of Moses became a serpent, (and) it swallowed the serpents of the magici ans.\" Again it is written (Nm 21:9), \"He made a serpent of bronze (and) hung it upon a pole ... ...

[...] enter [...] the abundance [...] those who [...] I will speak my mystery to those who are mine and to those who will be mine. Moreover it is these who have known him who is, the Father, that is, the Root of the All, the Ineffable One who dwells in the Monad. He dwells alone in silence, and silence is tranquility since, after all, he was a Mona d and no one was before him. He dwells in the Dyad and in the Pair, and his Pair is Silence. And he posses sed the All dwelling within him. And as for Intent ion and Persistenc e, Love and Permane nce, they are indeed unbegotte n. God came forth: the Son, Mind of the All, that is, it is from the Root of the All that even his Though t stems, since he had this one (the Son) in Mind. For on behalf of the All, he receiv ed an alien Thought since there were nothing before him. From that place it is he who moved [...] a gushi ng spring. Now this is the Root of the All and Monad without any one before him. Now the second spring exists in silence and speaks with him alone. And the Fourth accordingly is he who restricted himself in the Fourth: while dwelling in the Three-hundred- sixtieth, he first brought himse lf (forth ), and in the Second he reve aled his will, and in the Fourth he spread himself out. While these things are due to the Root of the All, let us for our part enter his revelation and his goodness and his descent and the All, that is, the Son, the Father of the All, and the Mind of the Spirit; for he was possessing this one before [...]. He is a spring. He is one who appears in Silence, and he is Mind of the All dwelling secondarily with Life. For he is the projector of the All and the very hypostasis of the Father, that is, he is the Thought and his descent below. When he willed, the First Father revealed himsel f in him. Since, after all, because of him the revelation is available to the All, I for my part cal l the All 'the desire of the All'. And he took such a thought concer ning the All - I for my part call the thought 'Monogen es'. For now God has brought Truth, the one who glorifies the Root of the All. Thus it is he who revealed himself in Monog enes, and in him he revealed the Ineffable One [...] the Truth. They saw him dwelling in the Mona d and in the Dyad and in the Tetrad. He first brought forth Monoge nes and Limit. And Limit is the separator of the All and the confirmation of the All, since they are [...] the hundred [...]. He is the Mind [...] the Son. He is complete ly ineffable to the All, and he is the confirmation and the hypostasis of the All, the silent veil, the true High Priest, the one who has the authority to enter the Holies of Holies, reveali ng the glory of the Aeons and bringing forth the abundance to <fragrance>. The East [...] that is in Him. He is the one who revealed himself as the prima l sanctuary and the treasury of the All. And he encompa ssed the All, he who is higher than the All. These for their part sent Christ forth to establ ish her just as they were established before her descent. And they say concerning him: [...] He is not manifest, but invisible to those remain ing within Limit. And he possesses four powers: a separator and a confirmor, a form- provider and a substance-producer.

That Tetrad projected the Tetrad which is the one consisting of Word and Life and Man and Churc h. Now the Uncreated One projected Word and Life.

Moreover, it is the one from the Triaconta d of the Aeons who bear fruit from the Triacontrad. They enter jointly, but they come forth singly, fleeing from the Aeons and the Uncontainable Ones. And the Uncontainable Ones, once they had looked at him, glorified Mind since he is an Uncontainable One that exists in the Pleroma. But the Decad from Word and Life brought forth decads so as to make the Pleroma become a hundr ed, and the Dodecad from Man and Church brought forth and made the Triacontad so as to make the three hundred sixty becom e the Pleroma of the year.

He willed within himse lf bodily to leave the powers and he descended. And these things (passions ) Sophia suffered after her son ascended from her, for she knew that she dwelt in a [...] in unity and restoration. They were stopped [...] the brethren [...] these.

I deserve the things (passions) I suffer. I used to dwell in the Pleroma putting forth the Aeons and bearing fruit with my consort\" And she knew what she was and what had become of her. So they both suffered; they said she laughs since she remained alone and imitated the Uncontainable One, while he said she laughs since she cut hersel f off from her consort. [...] Indeed Jesus and Sophia revealed the creature. Since, after all, the seeds of Sophia are incomplete and formless, Jesus contrived a creature of this sort and made it of the seeds while Sophia worked with him. For since they are seeds and without form, he descended and brough t forth that pleroma of aeons which are in that place, since even the uncreated ones of those Aeons are of the pattern of the Pleroma and the uncont ainable Father. The Uncreated One brought forth the pattern of the uncreated, for it is from the uncreated that the Father brings forth into form. But the creature is a shadow of pre-existing things. Moreover, this Jesus created the creature, and he worked from the passions surrounding the seeds. And he separa ted them from one another, and the better passions he introdu ced into the spirit and the worse ones into the carnal. Now, first amon g all those passions [...] nor [...] him, since, after all, Prono ia caused the correc tion to project shadows and images of those who exist from the first and those who are and those who shall be. This, then, is the dispensat ion of believing in Jesus for the sake of him who inscribed the All with likenesses and images and shadows. After Jesus brought forth further, he brought forth for the All those of the Pleroma and of the syzygy, that is, the angels.

Therefore he acquired sons who angered one anoth er. And Cain killed Abel his brother, for the Demiurge breathed into them his spirit. And there took place the struggle with the apostasy of the angels and mankind, those of the right with those of the left, those in heave n with those on earth, the spirits with the carna l, and the Devil against God. Therefore the angels lusted after the daughters of men and came down to flesh so that God would cause a flood. And he almost regretted that he had created the world [...] the consort and Sophia and her Son and the angels and the seeds. But the syzygy is the complete one, and Sophia and Jesus and the angels and the seeds are images of the Pleroma. Moreover, the Demiurge cast a shadow over the syzygy and the Pleroma and Jesus and Sophia and the angels and the seeds. The complete one glorifies Sophia; the image glorifies Truth . And the glory of the seeds and Jesus are those of Silence and Monogen es. And the angels of the males and the seminal ones of the females are all Pleromas. Moreover whenever Sophia receives her consort and Jesus receives the Christ and the seeds and the angels, then the Pleroma will receive Sophia joyfully, and the All will come to be in unity and recon ciliation.

She made a revelation to me and said: \"No one is able to hear these things except the great powers alone, O Allogenes. A great power was put upon you, which the Father of the All, the Eternal, put upon you before you came to this place, in order that those things that are difficult to distinguish you might distinguish and those things that are unknow n to the multitude you might know, and that you might escape (in safety) to the One who is yours, who was first to save and who does not need to be saved ...

And endowed with the intellectual Word of these, he bears the noetic male Protoph anes like an image, and he acts within the individuals, either with craft or with skill or with partial instinct. He is endowed with the divine Autogenes like an image, and he knows each one of these. He acts separately and individually, continuing to rectify the failures from nature. He is endowed with the divine Triple-Male as salvat ion for them all, in cooperation with the Invisible Spirit. He is a word from a counse l, <he> is the perfect Youth. And this hypostasis is a ...

And the all-glorious One, Youel, anointed me again and she gave power to me. She said, \"Since your instruction has become complete, and you have known the Good that is within you, hear concerning the Triple -Powe red One those things that you will guard in great silence and great mystery, because they are not spoken to anyone except those who are worthy, those who are able to hear: nor is it fitting to speak to an uninstructed generation concer ning the U niversal One that is higher than perfect.

Whereas there is no possibility for complete comprehension, he is (nevertheless) know n. And this is so because of the third silence of Mentality and the secon d undivided activity which appear ed in the First Thoug ht, that is, the Aeon of Barbelo, together with the Indivisible One of the divisible likenesses and the Triple -Powered -One and the non-substant ial Existen ce.\" <Then> the power appeared by means of an activity that is at rest and silent, althoug h it uttered a sound thus: zza zza zza.

They do not exist together with those who exist nor those who truly exist.

And that beyond what is fitting for you, you shall not know at first, so as not to forfeit your kind.

But I did not despair of the words that I heard. I prepa red myself therei n and I deliberated with myself for a hundred years. And I rejoiced exceed ingly, since I was in a great light and a blessed path because those whom I was worthy to see as well as those whom I was worthy to hear (are) those whom it is fitting that the great powe rs alone ...

I saw the good divine Autogenes; and the Savior, who is the youthful , perfect Triple-Male Child; and his goodness, the noetic perfect Protoph anes-Harmedon; and the blessedness of the Kalyptos; and the primary origin of the blessedn ess, the Aeon of Barbel o, full of divinity; and the prima ry origin of the one without origin, the spiritual, invisible Triple -Powered One, the Universal One that is higher than perfect. When <I> was taken by the eternal Light out of the garment that was upon me, and taken up to a holy place whose likeness cannot be revealed in the world, then by means of a great blessednes s I saw all those about whom I had heard. And I praised all of them and I stood upon my knowledge and I inclined to the knowledge of the Universals, the Aeon of Barbelo. And I saw holy powers by mean s of the Luminar ies of the virginal male Barbelo telling me that I would be able to test what happens in the world: \"O Allogenes, behold your blessedness, how it silently abides, by which you know your proper self and, seeking yourself, withdraw to the - 2 5 5 -"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Vitali ty that you will see moving.

There was within me a stillness of silence, and I heard the Blessedness whereby I knew <my> proper self. And I withdrew to the Vitality as I sought <mysel f>, and I joined into it, and I stood , not firmly but silently. And I saw an eternal, intellectual, undiv ided motion that pertains to all the formless powers, (which is) unlimited by limitation. And when I wanted to stand firmly, I withdrew to the Existen ce, which I found standi ng and at rest, like an image and likeness of what is conferred upon me by a revelation of the Indivisible One and the One who is at rest. I was filled with revelation by means of a primary revelation of the Unknowable One. As though I were ignorant of him, I knew him, and I received power by him. Having been permanently strengthe ned, I knew the One who exists in me, and the Triple - Powered One, and the revelatio n of his uncontainableness. And by means of a primary revelation of the First One unknowa ble to them all, the God who is beyond perfection, I saw him and the Triple -Powered One that exists in them all. I was seeking the ineffable and Unknowable God - whom if one should know him, he would be absolutely ignorant of him - the Mediator of the Triple -Powered One who subsists in stillness and sile nce and is unknowable. And when I was confirmed in these matters, the powers of the Luminaries said to me, \"Cease hindering the inactivity that exists in you, by seeking incompr ehensible matters; rather, hear about him in so far as it is possible by means of a primary revelation and a r evelation.\" \"Now he is something insofar as he exists in that he either exists and will become, or acts or knows, although he lives without Mind or Life or Existen ce or Non-Existence, incompre hensibly.

Grant, Gnosticism (Harper & Brothers , New York , 1961), as quoted in Willis Barns tone, The Other Bible (Harp er & Row, San Franc isco, 1984). The gospel of truth is joy to those who have received from the Father of truth the gift of know ing him by the pow er of the Logos, who has come from the Pleroma and who is in the thought and the mind of the Father; he it is who is called \"the Savior,\" since that is the name of the work which he must do for the redemption of those who have not known the Father. For the name of the gospel is the manifestation of hope, since that is the discovery of those who seek him, because the All sought him from whom it had come forth. You see, the All had been inside of him, that illimitable, inconceivable one, who is better than every thought. This ignora nce of the Father brought about terror and fear. And terror became dense like a fog, that no one was able to see. Because of this, error became strong. But it worked on its hylic substance vainly, because it did not know the truth. It was in a fashioned form while it was preparing, in power and in beauty , the equivalent of truth. This then, was not a humiliation for him, that illimitable, inconceivable one. For they were as nothing, this terror and this forgetful ness and this figure of falsehood, whereas this established truth is unchanging, unperturbe d and completely beautiful. For this reason, do not take error too seriousl y. Thus, since it had no root, it was in a fog as regards the Father, engaged in preparing works and forgetful nesses and fears in order, by these means, to begui le those of the middle and to make them captiv e. The forgetfulness of error was not revealed. It did not become light beside the Father. Forgetful ness did not exist with the Father, although it existed because of him. What exists in him is knowled ge, which was reveale d so that forgetfulness might be destroy ed and that they might know the Father, Since forgetful ness existed because they did not know the Father, if they then come to know the Father, from that moment on forgetfulness will cease to exist. That is the gospel of him whom they seek, which he has revealed to the perfect through the mercies of the Father as the hidde n mystery, Jesus the Christ. Throug h him he enlightened those who were in darkness because of forgetfulness. He enlightened them and gave them a path. And that path is the truth which he taugh t them. For this reason error was angry with him, so it persecuted him. It was distressed by him, so it made him powerless. He was nailed to a cross. He became a fruit of the know ledge of the Father. He did not, howe ver, destroy them because they ate of it. He rather caused those who ate of it to be joyfu l because of this discovery. And as for him, them he found in himself, and him they found in themselves, that illimitable, inconceivable one, that perfect Father who made the all, in whom the All is, and whom the All lacks, since he retained in himself their perfectio n, which he had not given to the all. The Father was not jealous. What jealousy, indeed, is there between him and his members? For, even if the Aeon had received their perfection, they would not have been able to approa ch the perfection of the Father, because he retained their perfection in himse lf, giving it to them as a way to return to him and as a know ledge unique in perfection. He is the one who set the All in order and in whom the All existed and whom the All lacked. As one of whom some have no knowledge, he desires that they know him and that they love him. For what is it that the All lacked, if not the knowledge of the Father? He became a guide, quiet and in leisure. In the middle of a school he came and spoke the Word, as a teacher. Those who were wise in their own estimatio n came to put him to the test. But he discredited them as empty-headed people. They hated him because they reall y were not w ise men. After all these came also the little children, those who possess the know ledge of the Father. When they became strong they were taugh t the aspects of the Father's face. They came to know and they - 2 6 3 -"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"were known. They were glorified and they gave glory. In their heart, the living book of the Living was manifest, the book which was writte n in the thoug ht and in the mind of the Father and, from before the foundation of the All, is in that incomprehensible part of him. This is the book which no one found possible to take, since it was reserved for him who will take it and be slain. No one was able to be manifest from those who believed in salvatio n as long as that book had not appeared. For this reason, the compassionate, faithful Jesus was patient in his sufferings until he took that book, since he knew that his death meant life for many. Just as in the case of a will which has not yet been opened, for the fortune of the deceased master of the house is hidden , so also in the case of the All which had been hidden as long as the Father of the All was invisible and unique in himsel f, in whom every space has its source. For this reason Jesus appeared. He took that book as his own. He was nailed to a cross. He affixed the edict of the Father to the cross. Oh, such great teaching! He abases himse lf even unto death, though he is clothed in eternal life. Having divested himse lf of these perishable rags, he clothed himself in incorruptibility, which no one could possib ly take from him. Having entered into the empty territory of fears, he passed before those who were stripped by forgetfulness, being both knowledge and perfection, proclaiming the things that are in the heart of the Father, so that he became the wisdom of those who have received instruction. But those who are to be taught, the living who are inscribed in the book of the living, learn for themselves, receiv ing instruct ions from the Father, turning to him again. Since the perfectio n of the All is in the Father, it is necessary for the All to ascend to him. Theref ore, if one has know ledge, he gets what belongs to him and draws it to himself. For he who is ignorant, is deficient, and it is a great deficiency, since he lacks that which will make him perfect. Since the perfection of the All is in the Father, it is necessary for the All to ascend to him and for each one to get the things which are his. He registered them first, havin g prepared them to be given to those who came from him. Those whose name he knew first were called last, so that the one who has know ledge is he whose name the Father has pronounc ed. For he whose name has not been spoken is ignorant. Indeed, how shall one hear if his name has not been uttered? For he who remains ignorant until the end is a creature of forgetfulness and will perish with it. If this is not so, why have these wretc hes no name, why do they have no sound? Hence, if one has knowledge, he is from above. If he is called, he hears, he replies, and he turns towar d him who called him and he ascends to him and he knows what he is called. Since he has know ledge, he does the will of him who called him. He desires to please him and he finds rest. He receives a certain name. He who thus is going to have know ledge knows whence he came and whither he is going . He knows it as a person who, having become intoxicated, has turned from his drunken ness and having come to himself, has restored what is his own. He has turned many from error. He went before them to their own places, from which they departed when they erred because of the depth of him who surrounds every place, whereas there is nothing which surround s him. It was a great wonder that they were in the Father without know ing him and that they were able to leave on their own, since they were not able to contain him and know him in whom they were, for indeed his will had not come forth from him. For he revealed it as a knowledge with which all its emanations agree, namely, the knowledge of the living book which he reveale d to the Aeons at last as his letters, displayi ng to them that these are not merely vowels nor consonants, so that one may read them and think of something void of meanin g; on the contrary, they are letters which convey the truth. They are pronoun ced only when they are known. Each letter is a perfect truth like a perfect book, for they are letters writte n by the hand of the unity, since the Father wrote them for the Aeons, so that they by means of his letters might come to kn ow the Father. While his wisdom mediates on the logos, and since his teaching expresses it, his knowledge has been revealed. His honor is a crown upon it. Since his joy agrees with it, his glory exalte d it. It has revealed his image. It has obtained his rest. His love took bodily form around it. His trust - 2 6 4 -"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"embraced it. Thus the logos of the Father goes forth into the All, being the fruit of his heart and expression of his will. It suppor ts the All. It chooses and also takes the form of the All, purify ing it, and causing it to return to the Father and to the Mother, Jesus of the utmost sweetness. The Father opens his bosom, but his bosom is the Holy Spirit. He reveals his hidde n self which is his son, so that through the compassion of the Father the Aeons may know him, end their wearying search for the Father and rest themsel ves in him, knowing that this is rest. After he had filled what was incomp lete, he did away with form. The form of it is the world, that which it served. For where there is envy and strife, there is an incompleteness; but where there is unity, there is completeness. Since this incom pleteness came about because they did not know the Father, so when they know the Father, incompleteness, from that moment on, will cease to exist. As one's ignorance disappears when he gains knowledge, and as darkness disappears when light appea rs, so also incomp leteness is eliminated by comple teness. Certainl y, from that moment on, form is no longer manifest, but will be dissolved in fusion with unity. For now their works lie scattered. In time unity will make the spaces complete. By mean s of unity each one will understand itself. By means of knowledge it will purify itself of diversit y with a view towards unity, devouring matter within itself like fire and da rkness by light, death by life. Certainly, if these things have happened to each one of us, it is fitting for us, surely, to think about the All so that the house may be holy and silent for unity. Like people who have moved from a neighborhood, if they have some dishes around which are not good, they usuall y break them. Nevertheless the householder does not suffer a loss, but rejoices, for in the place of these defective dishes there are those which are completely perfect. For this is the judgement which has come from above and which has judged every person, a drawn two-edged sword cutting on this side and that. When it appeared, I mean, the Logos, who is in the heart of those who pronounce it - it was not merely a sound but it has become a body - a great disturban ce occur red among the dishes, for some were emptied, others filled: some were provided for, others were remove d; some were purifi ed, still others were broken. All the spaces were shaken and disturbed for they had no composure nor stability. Error was disturbed not knowi ng what it should do. It was troubled; it lamented, it was beside itself because it did not know anything. When knowledge, which is its abolishment, approached it with all its emanations, error is empty , since there is nothing in it. Truth appeared; all its emanations recogn ized it. They actual ly greeted the Father with a power which is complete and which joins them with the Father. For each one loves truth because truth is the mouth of the Father. His tongue is the Holy Spirit, who joins him to truth attaching him to the mouth of the Father by his tongue at the time he shall receive the Holy Spirit. This is the manifestation of the Father and his revelation to his Aeons. He revealed his hidden self and explain ed it. For who is it who exists if it is not the Father himsel f? All the spaces are his emanatio ns. They knew that they stem from him as children from a perfect man. They knew that they had not yet received form nor had they yet received a name, every one of which the Father produce s. If they at that time receive form of his knowledge, though they are truly in him, they do not know him. But the Father is perfect. He knows every space which is within him. If he pleases, he reveals anyone whom he desires by giving him a form and by giving him a name; and he does give him a name and cause him to come into being. Those who do not yet exist are ign orant of him who created them. I do not say, then, that those who do not yet exist are nothing. But they are in him who will desire that they exist when he pleases, like the event which is going to happen. On the one hand, he knows, before anything is revealed, what he will produce . On the other hand , the fruit which has not yet been revealed does not know anything, nor is it anything either. Thus each space which, on its part, is in the Father comes from the existent one, who, on his part, has established it from the nonexisten t. [...] he who does not exist at all, will never exist. What, then, is that which he wants him to think? \"I am like the shadows and phantoms of the night.\" When morni ng comes, this one knows that the fear which he had experienced was nothing. Thus they were ignorant of the Father; he is the one whom they did not see. Since there had been fear and confusion and a lack of confidence and doubl emindness and division, there were many illusions which were conceived by him, the foregoi ng, as well as empty ignora nce - as if they were fast asleep and found themse lves a prey to trouble d dreams. Either there is a place to which they - 2 6 5 -"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"flee, or they lack strength as they come, having pursue d unspe cified things. Either they are involved in inflicting blows, or they themse lves receive bruises. Either they are falling from high places, or they fly off through the air, though they have no wings at all. Other times, it is as if certain people were trying to kill them, even though there is no one pursuing them; or, they themse lves are killing those beside them, for they are stained by their blood. Until the moment when they who are passing through all these things - I mean they who have experienced all these confusions - awake, they see nothing because the dream s were nothing. It is thus that they who cast ignorance from them as sheep do not consider it to be anything, nor regard its propertie s to be something real, but they renoun ce them like a dream in the night and they consider the know ledge of the Father to be the dawn. It is thus that each one has acted, as if he were asleep, during the time when he was ignorant and thus he comes to understand, as if he were awakening. And happy is the man who comes to himself and awakens. Indeed, blessed is he who has opened the eyes of the blind. And the Spirit came to him in haste when it raised him. Having given its hand to the one lying prone on the ground, it placed him firmly on his feet, for he had not yet stood up. He gave them the means of knowin g the knowledge of the Father and the revelat ion of his son. For when they saw it and listened to it, he permitted them to take a taste of and to smell and to grasp the beloved son. He appeared, inform ing them of the Father, the illimitable one. He inspired them with that which is in the mind, while doing his will. Many received the light and turned towards him. But material men were alien to him and did not discern his appeara nce nor recognize him. For he came in the likeness of flesh and nothing blocked his way because it was incorruptible and unrestrainable. Moreover, while saying new things, speaking about what is in the heart of the Father, he proclaimed the faultless word. Light spoke throug h his mouth, and his voice brought forth life. He gave them thoug ht and understandi ng and mercy and salvat ion and the Spirit of strength derived from the limitlessness of the Father and sweetness. He caused punishme nts and scourgin gs to cease, for it was they which caused many in need of mercy to astray from him in error and in chains - and he mightily destroyed them and derided them with knowled ge. He became a path for those who went astray and knowledge to those who were ignora nt, a discovery for those who sought, and a support for those who tremble, a purity for those who were defiled. He is the shepherd who left behind the ninety-nine sheep which had not strayed and went in search of that one which was lost. He rejoiced when he had found it. For ninety-nine is a numbe r of the left hand, which holds it. The moment he finds the one, however, the whole numbe r is transfe rred to the right hand. Thus it is with him who lacks the one, that is, the entire right hand which attracts that in which it is deficient, seizes it from the left side and transfers it to the right. In this way, then, the number becomes one hundred. This numbe r signifies the Father. He labored even on the Sabbath for the sheep which he found fallen into the pit. He saved the life of that sheep, bringing it up from the pit in order that you may understand fully what that Sabbath is, you who possess full understanding. It is a day in which it is not fitting that salvation be idle, so that you may speak of that heavenly day which has no night and of the sun which does not set because it is perfect. Say then in your heart that you are this perfect day and that in you the light which does n ot fail dwel ls. Speak concerning the truth to those who seek it and of knowled ge to those who, in their error, have committed sin. Make sure-footed those who stum ble and stretch forth your hands to the sick. Nourish the hungry and set at ease those who are troubled. Foster men who love. Raise up and awaken those who sleep. For you are this understandi ng which encourages. If the strong follow this course, they are even stronger. Turn your attention to yourselves. Do not be concerned with other things, namely, that which you have cast forth from yourse lves, that which you have dismissed. Do not return to them to eat them. Do not be moth-eaten. Do not be worm -eaten, for you have already shaken it off. Do not be a place of the devil, for you have already destroyed him. Do not strengthe n your last obstacles, because that is reprehensible. For the lawless one is nothing. He harms himse lf more than the law. For that one does his works because he is a lawless person. - 2 6 6 -"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"But this one, because he is a righteous person, does his works among others. Do the will of the Father, then, for you are from him. For the Father is sweet and his will is good. He knows the things that are yours, so that you may rest yourselves in them. For by the fruits one knows the things that are yours, that they are the children of the Father, and one knows his aroma, that you originate from the grace of his countenance. For this reason, the Father loved his aroma; and it manifests itself in every place; and when it is mixed with matter, he gives his aroma to the light; and into his rest he causes it to ascend in every form and in every sound. For there are no nostri ls which smell the aroma, but it is the Spirit which possesses the sense of smell and it draws it for itself to itself and sinks into the aroma of the Father. He is, indeed, the place for it, and he takes it to the place from which it has come, in the first aroma which is cold. It is somethi ng in a psychic form, resemb ling cold water which is [...] since it is in soil which is not hard, of which those who see it think, \"It is earth.\" Afterwards, it becomes soft again. If a breath is taken, it is usually hot. The cold aromas, then, are from the division. For this reason, God came and destroyed the division and he brought the hot Pleroma of love, so that the cold may not return , but the unity of the Perfe ct Thought prevai l. This is the word of the Gospel of the finding of the Pleroma for those who wait for the salvat ion which comes from above. When their hope, for which they are waiting, is waiting - they whose likeness is the light in which there is no shadow, then at that time the Pleroma is about to come. The deficiency of matter, however, is not because of the limitlessness of the Father who comes at the time of the deficiency. And yet no one is able to say that the incorrupti ble One will come in this manner. But the depth of the Father is increasing, and the though t of error is not with him. It is a matter of falling down and a matter of being readily set upright at the finding of that one who has come to him who will turn back. For this turning back is called \"repentanc e\". For this reason, incorrupt ion has breathed. It followed him who has sinned in order that he may find rest. For forgiveness is that which remains for the light in the deficiency, the word of the pleroma. For the physician hurries to the place in which there is sickness, because that is the desire which he has. The sick man is in a deficient condit ion, but he does not hide himself because the physician possesses that which he lacks. In this manner the deficiency is filled by the Pleroma, which has no deficiency, which has given itself out in order to fill the one who is deficient, so that grace may take him, then, from the area which is deficient and has no grace. Because of this a diminishing occurred in the place which there is no grace, the area w here the one who is small, who is deficient, is taken hold of. He revealed himse lf as a Pleroma, i.e., the finding of the light of truth which has shined towards him, because he is unchangeable. For this reason, they who have been troubled speak about Christ in their midst so that they may receive a return and he may anoin t them with the ointment. The ointment is the pity of the Father, who will have mercy on them. But those whom he has anoint ed are those who are perfect. For the filled vessels are those which are customa rily used for anoint ing. But when an anoint ing is finished, the vessel is usually empty, and the cause of its deficiency is the consumption of its ointment. For then a breath is drawn only through the power which he has. But the one who is without deficiency - one does not trust anyone beside him nor does one pour anyth ing out. But that which is the deficient is filled again by the perfect Father. He is good. He knows his plantings because he is the one who has planted them in his Paradise. And his Paradise is his place of rest. This is the perfect ion in the thought of the Father and these are the words of his reflection. Each one of his words is the work of his will alone, in the revelat ion of his Logos. Since they were in the depth of his mind, the Logos, who was the first to come forth, caused them to appear, along with an intellect which speaks the unique word by means of a silent grace. It was called \"thought,\" since they were in it before becomi ng manifest. It happened, then, that it was the first to come forth - at the moment pleasing to the will of him who desired it; and it is in the will that the Father is at rest and with which he is pleased. Nothi ng happens without him, nor does anything occur without the will of the Father. But his will is incompre hensible. His will is his mark, but no one can know it, nor is it possible for them to con centrate on it in order to possess it. But that which he wishes takes place at the mom ent he wishes it - even if the view does not please anyone: it is God`s will. For the - 2 6 7 -"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Father knows the beginning of them all as well as their end. For when their end arrives , he will question them to their faces. The end, you see, is the recognition of him who is hidden, that is, the Father, from whom the beginning came forth and to whom will return all who have come from him. For they were made manifest for the glory and the joy of his name. And the name of the Father is the Son. It is he who, in the beginning, gave a name to him who came forth from him - he is the same one - and he begat him for a son. He gave him his name which belonged to him - he, the Father, who possesses everything which exists around him. He possess the name; he has the son. It is possib le for them to see him. The name, howe ver, is invisible, for it alone is the mystery of the invisible about to come to ears completel y filled with it through the Father`s agency. Moreover, as for the Father, his name is not pronounced, but it is revealed through a son. Thus, then, the name is great. Who, then, has been able to pronounce a name for him, this great name, except him alone to whom the name belongs and the sons of the name in whom the name of the Father is at rest, and who themselves in turn are at rest in his name, since the Father has no beginning? It is he alone who engendered it for himse lf as a name in the beginning before he had created the Aeons, that the name of the Father should be over their heads as a lord - that is, the real name, which is secure by his authority and by his perfect powe r. For the name is not drawn from lexicons nor is his name derived from common name- giving, But it is invisible. He gave a name to himself alone, because he alone saw it and because he alone was capable of giving himsel f a name. For he who does not exist has no name. For what name would one give him who did not exist? Neverthel ess, he who exists also with his name and he alone knows it, and to him alone the Father gave a name. The Son is his name. He did not, theref ore, keep it secretly hidden, but the son came into existence. He himsel f gave a name to him. The name, then, is that of the Father, just as the name of the Father is the Son. For otherwise, where would compassion find a name - outside of the Father? But someone will probab ly say to his companion, \"Who would give a name to someone who existed before himsel f, as if, indeed, children did not receive their name from one of those who gave them birth?\" Above all, then, it is fitting for us to think this point over: What is the name? It is the real name. It is, indeed, the name which came from the Father, for it is he who owns the name. He did not, you see, get the name on loan, as in the case of others because of the form in which each one of them is going to be created. This, then, is the authoritati ve name. There is no one else to whom he has given it. But it remained unnamed, unuttered, `till the moment when he, who is perfect, pronoun ced it himsel f; and it was he alone who was able to pronounce his name and to see it. When it pleased him, then, that his son should be his pronoun ced name and when he gave this name to him, he who has come from the depth spoke of his secrets, because he knew that the Father was absolute goodness. For this reason, indeed, he sent this particu lar one in order that he might speak concerning the place and his place of rest from which he had come forth, and that he might glorify the Pleroma, the greatness of his name and the sweetness of his Father. Each one will speak concer ning the place from which he has come forth, and to the region from which he received his essential being, he will hasten to return once again. And he want from that place - the place where he was - because he tasted of that place, as he was nourished and grew. And his own place of rest is his Pleroma . All the eman ations from the Father, therefore, are Pleroma s, and all his emanations have their roots in the one who caused them all to grow from himse lf. He appointed a limit. They, then, became manifest individually in order that they might be in their own thought, for that place to which they extend their though ts is their root, which lifts them upward through all height s to the Father. They reach his head, which is rest for them, and they remain there near to it so that they say that they have partic ipated in his face by means of embraces. But these of this kind were not manifest, because they have not risen above themselves. Neither have they been deprived of the glory of the Father nor have they thought of him as small, nor bitter, nor angry, but as absolute ly good, unperturbed, sweet, knowi ng all the spaces before they came into existen ce and having no need of instruction.

MacRae Selection made from James M. Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library, revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francisco, 1990. The gospel of truth is joy for those who have received from the Father of truth the grace of know ing him, through the power of the Word that came forth from the pleroma, the one who is in the thought and the mind of the Father, that is, the one who is addressed as 'the Savior', (that) being the name of the work he is to perform for the redemption of those who were ignorant of the Father, while in the name of the gospel is the proclam ation of hope, being discov ery for those who search for him. When the totality went about searching for the one from whom they had come forth - and the totality was inside of him, the incompre hensible, inconceivable one who is superior to every thought - ignora nce of the Father brought about anguis h and terror; and the anguish grew solid like a fog, so that no one was able to see. For this reason, error became powerfu l; it worked on its own matter foolis hly, not having known the truth. It set about with a creation, preparin g with power and beauty the substitute for the truth. This was not, then, a humiliation for him, the incompre hensible, incon ceivable one, for they were nothing, the anguish and the oblivion and the creature of deceit, while the established truth is immutabl e, imperturba ble, perfect in beauty. For this reason, despi se error. Thus, it had no root; it fell into a fog regarding the Father, while it was involved in preparing works and oblivions and terrors, in order that by mean s of these it might entice those of the middle and capture them. The oblivion of error was not revealed. It is not a [...] from the Father. Oblivion did not come into existence from the Father, although it did indeed come into existe nce because of him. But what comes into existen ce in him is know ledge, which appea red in order that oblivion might vanish and the Father might be known. Since oblivion came into existence because the Father was not known , then if the Father comes to be know n, oblivion will not exist from that moment on. Throug h this, the gospel of the one who is searched for, which <was> revealed to those who are perfect, throug h the mercies of the Father, the hidden mystery, Jesus, the Christ, enlightened those who were in darkness through oblivion. He enlightened them; he showed (them) a way; and the way is the truth which he taught them. For this reason, error grew angry at him, persecuted him, was distressed at him, (and) was brought to naught. He was nailed to a tree (and) he became fruit of the knowledge of the Father. It did not, however, cause destructio n because it was eaten, but to those who ate it, it gave (cause) to become glad in the discovery, and he discovered them in himse lf, and they discovered him in themse lves. As for the incompre hensible, inconceivable one, the Father, the perfect one, the one who made the totality, within him is the totality, and of him the totality has need. Although he retained their perfection within himse lf, which he did not give to the totality, the Father was not jealous . What jealousy indeed (could there be) between himsel f and his members? For if this aeon had thus received their perfecti on, they could not have come [...] the Father. He retains within himse lf their perfection, granting it to them as a return to him, and a perfect ly unitary knowledge. It is he who fashioned the totali ty, and within him is the totality, and the totality was in need of him. As in the case of a person of whom some are ignorant, he wishes to have them know him and love him, so - for what did the totality have need of if not know ledge regard ing the Father? - he became a guide, restful and leisurel y. In schools he appeared, (and) he spoke the word as a teacher. There came the men wise in their own estimation, putting him to the test. But he confounded them, because they were foolish.

Just as there lies hidden in a will, before it is opened, the fortune of the deceased master of the house , so (it is) with the totality, which lay hidden while the Father of the totality was invisible, being somethi ng which is from him, from whom every space comes forth. For this reason Jesus appeared; he put on that book; he was nailed to a tree; he published the edict of the Father on the cross. O such great teaching! He draws himself down to death, though life eternal clothes him. Having stripped himse lf of the perisha ble rags, he put on imperishability, which no one can possibly take away from him. Having entered the empty spaces of terrors, he passed through those who were strippe d naked by oblivion, being knowledge and perfect ion, proclaiming the things that are in the heart, [...] teach those who will receive teaching. But those who are to receive teaching are the living, who are inscribed in the book of the living. It is about themsel ves that they receive instru ction, receiving it from the Father, turning again to him. Since the perfection of the totality is in the Father, it is necessary for the totality to ascend to him. Then, if one has know ledge, he receives what are his own, and draws them to himse lf. For he who is ignorant is in need, and what he lacks is great, since he lacks that which will make him perfect. Since the perfect ion of the totality is in the Father, and it is necessary for the totality to ascend to him, and for each one to receive what are his own, he enrolled them in advance, having prepared them to give to those who came forth from him. Those whose name he knew in advance were called at the end, so that one who has knowledge is the one whose name the Father has uttered. For he whose name has not been spoken is ignora nt. Indeed, how is one to hear, if his name has not been called? For he who is ignorant until the end is a creature of oblivion, and he will vanish along with it. If not, how is it that these miserab le ones have no name, (that) they do not have the call? Theref ore, if one has knowledge, his is from above. If he is called , he hears, he answers, and he turns to him who is calling him, and ascends to him. And he knows in what manner he is called. Having knowledge, he does the will of the one who called him, he wishes to be pleasi ng to him, he receives rest. Each one's name comes to him. He who is to have know ledge in this manner knows where he comes from and where he is going. He knows as one who, having become drunk, has turned away from his drunk enness, (and) having returned to himse lf, has set right what are his own. He has brought many back from error. He has gone before them to their places, from which they had moved away, since it was on account of the depth that they receiv ed error, the depth of the one who encircles all spaces, while there is none that encircles him. It was a great wonder that they were in the Father, not know ing him, and (that) they were able to come forth by themse lves, since they were unable to comprehend or to know the one in whom they were. For if his will had not thus emerged from him - for he revealed it in view of a knowledge in which all its emanations concur. This is the knowl edge of the living book, which he revealed to the aeons at the end as his letters, revealing how they are not vowels nor are they consonants, so that one might read them and thi nk of somethi ng foolish, but (rather that) they are letters of the truth, which they alone speak who know them. Each letter is a complete <thought> , like a complete book, since they are letters written by the Unity, the Father having writte n them for the aeons, in order that by means of his letters they should know the Father. While his wisdom contempl ates the Word, and his teaching utters it, his knowledge has revealed <it>. While forebearan ce is a crown upon it, and his gladness is in harmony with it, his glory has - 2 7 1 -"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"exalted it, his image has revealed it, his repose has received it into itself, his love has made a body over it, his fidelity has embraced it. In this way, the Word of the Father goes forth in the totality, as the fruit of his heart and an impress ion of his will. But it supports the totality, purifying them, bringing them back into the Father, into the Mother, Jesus of the infinite sweetness. The Father reveals his bosom. - Now his bosom is the Holy Spirit. - He reveals what is hidden of him - what is hidde n of him is his Son - so that through the mercies of the Father, the aeons may know him and cease laboring in search of the Father, resting there in him, knowing that this is the (final) rest. Having filled the deficiency, he abolished the form - the form of it is the world, that in which he served. - For the place where there is envy and strife is deficient, but the place where (there is) Unity is perfect. Since the deficiency came into being because the Father was not known, therefor e, when the Father is know n, from that moment on, the deficiency will no longer exist. As in the case of the ignoran ce of a person, when he comes to have knowl edge, his ignorance vanishes of itself, as the darkness vanishes when the light appears, so also the deficiency vanishes in the perfection. So from that moment on, the form is not apparent, but it will vanish in the fusion of Unity, for now their works lie scattered. In time, Unity will perfect the spaces. It is within Unity that each one will attain himse lf; within know ledge, he will purify himse lf from multip licity into Unity, consuming matter w ithin himself like fire, and darkness by light, death by life. If indeed these things have happened to each one of us, then we must see to it above all that the house will be holy and silent for the Unity - as in the case of some people who moved out of dwellings having jars that in spots were not good. They would break them, and the master of the house would not suffer loss. Rather, <he> is glad, because in place of the bad jars (there are) full ones which are made perfect. For such is the judgment which has come from above. It has passe d judgment on everyone; it is a drawn sword, with two edges, cutting on either side. When the Word appeared, the one that is within the heart of those who utter it - it is not a sound alone, but it became a body - a great disturbance took place among the jars, because some had been emptied, others filled; that is, some had been supplied, others poured out, some had been purified, still others broken up. All the spaces were shaken and disturbed, because they had no order nor stability. Error was upset, not knowing what to do; it was grieved, in mourning, afflicting itself because it knew nothing. When knowledge drew near it - this is the downfall of (error) and all its emanatio ns - error is empty, having nothi ng inside. Truth appeared; all its emanations knew it. They greeted the Father in truth with a perfect power that joins them with the Father. For, as for everyone who loves the truth - because the truth is the mouth of the Father; his tongue is the Holy Spirit - he who is joined to the truth is joined to the Father's mouth by his tongue, whenever he is to receive the Holy Spirit, since this is the manifestation of the Father, and his revelat ion to his aeons. He manifested what was hidden of him; he explain ed it. For who contains, if not the Father alone? All the spaces are his emanations. They have known that they came forth from him, like children who are from a grown man. They knew that they had not yet received form, nor yet received a name, each one of which the Father begets. Then, when they receive form by his knowledge, though truly within him, they do not know him. But the Father is perfect, knowi ng every space within him. If he wishes, he manifests whomever he wishes, by giving him form and giving him a name, and he gives a name to him, and brings it about that those come into existence who, before they come into existence, are ignora nt of him who fashioned them. I do not say, then, that they are nothing (at all) who have not yet come into existen ce, but they are in him who will wish that they come into existe nce when he wishes, like the time that is to come. Before all things appear, he knows what he will produce. But the fruit which is not yet manif est does not know anything, nor does it do anyth ing. Thus also, every space which is itself in the Father is from the one who exists, who establ ished it from what does not exist. For he who has no root has no fruit either, but though he thinks to himse lf, \"I have come into being,\" yet he will perish by himse lf. For this reason, he who did not exist at all will never come into existen ce. What, then, did he wish him to think of himse lf? This: \"I have come into being like the shadows and phantom s of the night.\" When the light shines on the terror which that person had experien ced, he knows that it is nothi ng. - 2 7 2 -"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Thus, they were ignorant of the Father, he being the one whom they did not see. S ince it was terror and disturban ce and instability and doubt and division, there were many illusions at work by means of these, and (many) empty fictions, as if they were sunk in sleep, and found themselves in disturbing dreams. Either (there is) a place to which they are fleeing, or without strength they come (from) having chased after others, or they are involved in striking blows, or they are receiving blows themselves, or they have fallen from high places, or they take off into the air, though they do not even have wings. Again, sometimes (it is as) if peopl e were murdering them, though there is no one even pursuing them, or they themsel ves are killing their neighbors, for they have been stained with their blood. When those who are going through all these things wake up, they see nothing, they who were in the midst of all these disturba nces, for they are nothing. Such is the way of those who have cast ignorance aside from them like sleep, not esteeming it as anyth ing, nor do they esteem its works as solid things either, but (rather,) they leave them behind like a dream in the night. The knowledge of the Father, they value as the dawn. This is the way each one has acted, as though asleep at the time when he was ignorant. And this is the way he has <come to know ledge>, as if he had awakened. {and} Good for the man who will return and awaken. And blessed is he who has opened the eyes of the blind. And the Spirit ran after him, hastening from waking him up. Having extend ed his hand to him who lay upon the ground, he set him up on his feet, for he had not yet risen. He gave them the means of knowing the knowledge of the Father and the revelation of his Son. For when they had seen him and had heard him, he granted them to taste him, and to smell him, and to touch the beloved Son. When he had appear ed, instructing them about the Father, the incompre hensible one, when he had breathed into them what is in the thought, doing his will, when many had received the light, they turned to him. For the material ones were strangers, and did not see his likeness, and had not known him. For he came by mean s of fleshly form, while nothing blocked his course, because incorrupti bility is irresistible, since he, again, spoke new things, still speaking about what is in the heart of the Father, having brought forth the flawless Word. When light had spoken through his mouth, as well as his voice, which gave birth to life, he gave them thoug ht and understandi ng, and mercy and salvation, and the powerful spirit from the infiniteness and the sweetness of the Father. Having made punishment s and tortures cease - for it was they which were leading astray from his face some who were in need of mercy, in error and in bonds - he both destroyed them with powe r and confounded them with knowl edge. He became a way for those who were gone astray, and knowled ge for those who were ignorant, a discovery for those who were search ing, and a suppor t for those who were wavering, immaculateness for those who were defiled. He is the shepherd who left behind the ninety-nine sheep which were not lost. He went searching for the one which had gone astray. He rejoiced when he found it, for ninety-nine is a number that is in the left hand, which holds it. But when the one is found, the entire number passes to the right (hand). As that which lacks the one - that is, the entire right (hand) - draws what was deficient and takes it from the left-hand side and brings (it) to the right, so too the number becomes one hundr ed. It is the sign of the one who is in their sound; it is the Father. Even on the Sabbath, he labored for the sheep which he found fallen into the pit. He gave life to the sheep, having brought it up from the pit, in order that you might know interiorly - you, the sons of interior know ledge - what is the Sabbath, on which it is not fitting for salvation to be idle, in order that you may speak from the day from above, which has no night, and from the light which does not sink, because it is perfect. Say, then, from the heart, that you are the perfect day, and in you dwells the light that does not fail. Speak of the truth with those who search for it, and (of) knowledge to those who have committed sin in their error. Make firm the foot of those who have stumbled, and stretch out your hands to those who are ill. Feed those who are hungry, and give repose to those who are weary, and raise up those who wish to rise, and awaken those who sleep. For you are the understanding that is drawn forth.

Do not strengthen (those who are) obstacle s to you, who are collaps ing, as thoug h (you were) a suppor t (for them). For the lawless one is someone to treat ill, rather than the just one. For the former does his work as a lawless person; the latter as a righteous person does his work among others. So you, do the will of the Father, for you are from him. For the Father is sweet, and in his will is what is good. He has taken cognizance of the things that are yours, that you might find rest in them. For by the fruits does one take cognizance of the things that are yours, because the children of the Father are his fragrance, for they are from the grace of his countenance. For this reason, the Father loves his fragrance, and manifests it in every place. And if it mixes with matter, he gives his fragran ce to the light, and in his repose, he causes it to surpass every form (and) every sound. For it is not the ears that smell the fragrance, but (it is) the breath that has the sense of smell and attracts the fragrance to itself, and is submerged in the fragrance of the Father, so that he thus shelters it, and takes it to the place where it came from, from the first fragran ce, which is grown cold. It is somethi ng in a psychic form, being like cold water which has frozen (?), which is on earth that is not solid, of which those who see it think it is earth; afterwards, it dissolves again. If a breath draws it, it gets hot. The fragran ces, theref ore, that are cold are from the division. For this reason, faith came; it dissolved the division, and it brought the warm pleroma of love, in order that the cold should not come again, but (that) there should be the unity of perfect thought. This <is> the word of the gospel of the discovery of the pleroma, for those who await the salvation which is coming from on high. While their hope, for which they are waitin g, is in waiting - they whose image is light with no shadow in it - then, at that time, the pleroma is proceed ing to come. The <deficiency> of matter came to be not through the limitlessness of the Father, who is coming to give time for the deficiency, althoug h no one could say that the incorruptible one would come in this way. But the depth of the Father was multiplied, and the thought of error did not exist with him. It is a thing that falls, (and) it is a thing that easily stands upright (again), in the discov ery of him who has come to him whom he shall bring back. For the bringing-back is called 'repenten ce'. For this reason, incorruptibility breathed forth; it pursued the one who had sinned, in order that he might rest. For forgiveness is what remains for the light in the deficiency, the word of the pleroma. For the physician runs to the place where sickness is, because that is the will that is in him. He who has a deficiency, then, does not hide it, because one has what the other lacks. So the pleroma, which has no deficiency, but (which) fills up the deficiency, is what he provided from himse lf for filling up what he lacks, in order that therefore he might receive the grace. For when he was deficient, he did not have the grace. That is why there was diminut ion existing in the place where there is no grace. When that which was diminished was received, he revealed what he lacked, being (now) a pleroma; that is the discovery of the light of truth which rose upon him because it is immutable. That is why Christ was spoken of in their midst, so that those who were disturbed might receive a bringing-back, and he might anoint them with the ointment . This ointment is the mercy of the Father, who will have mercy on them. But those whom he has anoin ted are the ones who have become perfect. For full jars are the ones that are usually anointed . But when the anointing of one (jar) is dissolved, it is emptied, and the reason for there being a deficiency is the thing by which its ointment goes. For at that time a breath draws it, a thing in the powe r of that which is with it. But from him who has no deficiency, no seal is removed, nor is anything emptied, but what he lacks, the perfect Father fills again. He is good. He knows his plantings, because it is he who planted them in his paradise. Now his paradise is his place of rest. This is the perfection in the thought of the Father, and these are the words of his meditation. Each one of his words is the work of his one will in the revelatio n of his Word. While they were still depths of his thought, the Word, which was first to come forth, revealed them, along with a mind that speaks the one Word in silent grace. He was called 'thought', since they were in it before being revealed. It came about, then, that he was first to come forth, at the time when the will of him who willed desired it. And the will is what the Father rests in, and is pleased with.

His trace is the will, and no one will know him, nor is it possib le for one to scrutinize him, in order to grasp him. But when he wills, what he wills is this - even if the sight does not please them in any way before God - desiring the Father. For he knows the beginning of all of them, and their end. For at their end, he will question them directly. Now, the end is receiving knowledge about the one who is hidden, and this is the Father, from whom the beginning came forth, (and) to whom all will return who have come forth from him. And they have appeared for the glory and the joy of his name. Now the name of the Father is the Son. It is he who first gave a name to the one who came forth from him, who was himse lf, and he begot him as a son. He gave him his name, which belonged to him; he is the one to whom belongs all that exists around him, the Father. His is the name; his is the Son. It is possible for him to be seen. The name, howev er, is invisible, because it alone is the mystery of the invisible, which comes to ears that are completely filled with it by him. For indeed, the Father's name is not spoken, but (rather, ) it is apparent through a Son. In this way, then, the name is a great thing. Who, therefore, will be able to utter a name for him, the great name, except him alone to whom the name belongs, and the sons of the name, in whom rested the name of the Father, (who) in turn themse lves rested in his name? Since the Father is unengen dered, he alone is the one who begot him for him(self) as a name, before he brought forth the aeons, in order that the name of the Father should be over their head as lord, that is the name in truth, which is firm in his command, through perfect power. For the name is not from (mere) words, nor does his name consist of appellations, but (rather,) it is invisible. He gave a name to him alone, since he alone sees him, he alone having the power to give him a name. For he who does not exist has no name. For what name is given to him who does not exist? But the one who exists, exists also with his name, and he alone knows it, and (he) alone (knows how) to give him a name. It is the Father. The Son is his name. He did not, therefore, hide it in the thing, but it existed; as for the Son, he alone gave a name. The name, therefore, is that of the Father, as the name of the Father is the Son. Where indeed would compassi on find a name, except with the Father? But no doubt one will say to his neigh bor: \"Who is it who will give a name to him who existed before himself, as if offspri ng did not receive a name from those who begot <them>?\" First, then, it is fitting for us to reflect on this matter: What is the name? It is the name in truth; it is not therefore the name from the Father, for it is the one which is the proper name. Therefore, he did not receiv e the name on loan, as (do) others, accord ing to the form in which each one is to be produced. But this is the proper name. There is no one else who gave it to him. But he <is> unnamable, indescribable, until the time when he who is perfect spoke of him alone. And it is he who has the power to speak his name, and to see it. When, therefore, it pleased him that his name, which is loved, should be his Son, and he gave the name to him, that is, him who came forth from the depth, he spoke about his secret things, know ing that the Father is a being without evil. For that very reason, he brought him forth in order to speak about the place, and (about ) his resting-place, from which he had come forth, and to glorify the pleroma, the greatness of his name, and the sweetness of the Father. About the place each one came from, he will speak, and to the region where he received his establ ishment, he will hasten to return again and to take from that place - the place where he stood - receiving a taste from that place, and receiving nourish ment, receiving growth. And his own resting-place is his pleroma. Theref ore, all the emanatio ns of the Father are pleromas, and the root of all his emanations is in the one who made them all grow up in himself. He assigned them their destin ies. Each one, then, is manifest, in order that through their own though t <...>. For the place to which they send their thought, that place, their root, is what takes them up in all the heights, to the Father.

But they do not becom e manifest in this way, for they are not themselves exalted; (yet) neither did they lack the glory of the Father, nor did they think of him as small, nor that he is harsh, nor that he is wrathful, but (rather that) he is a being - 2 7 5 -"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"without evil, imperturba ble, sweet, knowing all spaces before they have come into existen ce, and he had no need to be instructed.

But they themselves are the truth; and the Father is within them, and they are in the Father, being perfect, being undivided in the truly good one, being in no way deficient in anything, but they are set at rest, refreshed in the Spirit.

Then the Perfect Son revealed himself to his Aeons, who originated through him, and he revealed them and glorified them, and gave them thrones, and stood in the glory with which he glorified himse lf. They blessed the Perfect Son, the Christ, the only-begotten God. And they gave glory, saying, \"He is! He is! The Son of God! The Son of God! It is he who is!

The first Aeon he established over the first: Armedo n, Nousanios, Armozel; the second he established over the second Aeon: Phaionios, Ainios, Oroiael; the third over the third Aeon: Mellephaneus, Loios, Daveit hai; the fourth over the fourth : Mousanios, Amethes, Eleleth. Now those Aeons were begotten by the God who was begotten - the Christ - and these Aeons received as well as gave glory.

He has neither form nor perfect ion, but, on the contrary, possesses the form of the glory of those begotten in the darkness. Now he is called 'Saklas', that is, 'Samael', 'Yaltabaoth', he who had taken power; who had snatched it away from the innocent one (Sophia); who had earlier overpowered her who is the Light`s Epinoia who had descended, her from whom he had come forth from originally. Now when the Epinoi a of the Light realized that he (Yaltaba oth) had begged him (the Light) for another order, even though he was lower than she, she said, \"Give me another order, so that you may become for me a dwell ing place, lest I dwell in disorder forever.\" And the order of the entire house of glory was agreed upon her word. A blessing was brought for her and the higher order released it to her. And the great Demon began to produce aeons in the likeness of the real Aeons, except that he produce d them out of his own power. Then I too revealed my Voice secretly, saying, \"Cease! Desist, (you) who tread on matter; for behol d, I am coming down to the world of mortals for the sake of my portion that was in that place from the time when the innocent Sophia was conquered, she who descended, so that I might thwart their aim which the one revealed by her appoi nts.\" And all were disturbed, each one who dwells in the house of the ignorant light, and the abyss trembled. And the Archigenetor of ignoran ce reigned over Chaos and the underworld, and produced a man in my likeness. But he neither knew that that one would become for him a senten ce of dissolution, nor does he recogn ize the power in him. But now I have come down and reached down to Chaos. And I was with my own who were in that place. I am hidden within them, empowe ring them, giving them shape.

And the high walls of darkness I overthre w, and the secure gates of those pitiless ones I broke, and I smashed their bars. And the evil force, and the one who beats you, and the one who hinders you, and the tyrant, and the adversary, and the one who is King, and the present enemy, indeed all these I explained to those who are mine, who are the Sons of the Light, in order that they might nullify them all, and be saved from all those bonds, and enter into the place where they were at first. I am the first one who descended on account of my portion which remains, that is, the Spirit that dwells in the soul, which originated from the Water of Life, and out of the immersio n of the mysterie s. And I spoke, I, together with the Archons and Authorities. For I had gone down below their language, and I spoke my mysteries to my own - a hidden mystery - and the bonds and eternal oblivion were nullified. And I bore fruit in them, that is, the Thought of the unchanging Aeon, and my house, and their Father. And I went down to those who were mine from the first, and I reached them and broke the first strands that enslaved them. Then everyone of those within me shon e, and I prepar ed a pattern for those ineffable Lights that are w ithin me. A men. The Discourse of Protennoia: On e I am the Voice that appea red through my Thought, for I am 'He who is syzygetic' since I am called 'the Thought of the Invisible One'. Since I am called 'the unchanging Speech', I am called 'She who is syzygetic'. I am a single one, since I am undefil ed. I am the Mother of the Voice, speaking in many ways, completing the All. It is in me that knowledge dwells, the knowledge of <things> everlasting. It is I who speak within every creature, and I was known by the All. It is I who lift up the Speech of the Voice to the ears of those who have known me, that is, the Sons of the Light. Now I have come the second time in the likeness of a female, and have spoken with them. And I shall tell them of the coming end of the Aeon and teach them of the beginning of the Aeon to come, the one without change, the one in which our appearance will be changed. We shall be purifi ed within those Aeons from which I revealed myself in the Thought of the likeness of my masculinity. I settle d among those who are worthy in the Though t of my changeless Aeon. For I shall tell you a mystery of this partic ular Aeon, and tell you about the forces that are in it. The birth beckons; hour begets hour, day begets day. The months made known the month.Ti me has gone round succeeding time. This partic ular Aeon was completed in this fashion, and it was estimated, and it (was) short, for it was a finger that released a finger, and a joint that was separated from a joint. Then, when the great Autho rities knew that the time of fulfillment had appeared - just as in the pangs of the parturient it (the time) has drawn near, so also had the destruction approached - all together the elements trembled, and the foundations of the underwor ld and the ceilings of Chaos shook, and a great fire shone within their midst, and the rocks and the earth were shaken like a reed shaken by the wind. And the lots of Fate and those who apportion the domici les were greatly disturbed over a great thunder. And the thrones of the Powers were disturbed, since they were overturn ed, and their King was afraid. And those who pursue Fate paid their allotment of visits to the path, and they said to the Powers, \"What is this disturbance and this shaking that has come upon us through a Voice <belonging> to the exalted Speec h? And our entire habitation has been shaken, and the entire circuit of the path of ascent has met with destructio n, and the path upon which we go, which takes us up to the Archgenitor of our birth, has ceased to be establ ished for us.\" Then the Powers answe red, saying, \"We too are at loss about it, since we did not know what was responsible for it. But arise, let us go up to the Archgenitor and ask him.\" And the powers all gathered and went up to the Archgenitor. They said to him, \"Where is your boasting in which you boast? Did we not hear you say, \"I am God, and I am your Father, and it is I who begot you. and - 2 8 0 -"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"there is none beside me\"? Now behold, there has appeared a Voice belonging to that invisible Speec h of the Aeon which we know not. And we ourselves did not recognize to whom we belon g, for that Voice which we listened to is foreign to us, and we did not recogn ize it; we did not know whence it was. It came and put fear in our midst and weakening in the members of our arms. So now let us weep and mourn most bitterly! As for the future, let us make our entire flight before we are imprisoned perforce, and taken down to the bosom of the underworld. For already the slackening of our bondage has approached, and the times are cut short, and the days have shortened, and our time has been fulfilled, and the weepi ng of our destruction has approached us, so that we may be taken to the place we recognize. For as for our tree from which we grew, a fruit of ignorance is what it has; and also its leaves, it is death that dwells in them, and darkness dwells under the shadow of its boughs. And it was in deceit and lust that we harvested it, this (tree) through which ignorant Chaos became for us a dwelling place. For behold, even he, the Archgenitor of our birt h, about whom we boast, even he did not know this Speech.\" So now, O sons of the Thought, listen to me, to the Speech of the Mother of your mercy, for you have become worthy of the mystery hidden from the Aeons, so that you might receive it. And the consummation of this particular Aeon and of the evil life has approached, and there dawns the beginning of the Aeon to come, which has no change forever. I am androg ynous. I am Mother (and) I am Father, since I copulate with myself. I copulated with mysel f and with those who love me, and it is through me alone that the All stands firm. I am the Womb that gives shape to the All by giving birth to the Light that shines in splendor. I am the Aeon to come. I am the fulfillment of the All, that is, Meirothea, the glory of the Mother. I cast voiced Speech into the ears of those who know me. And I am inviting you into the exalted, perfect Light. Moreov er, (as for) this (Light), when you enter it, you will be glorified by those who give glory, and those who enthron e will enthrone you. You will accept robes from those who give robes, and the baptizers will baptize you, and you will become gloriousl y glorious , the way you first were when you were <Light>. And I hid myself in everyone and revealed myself within them, and every mind seeking me longed for me, for it is I who gave shape to the All when it had no form. And I transformed their forms into (other) forms, until the time when a form will be given to the All. It is through me that the Voice origin ated, and it is I who put the breath within my own. And I cast into them the eternally Holy Spirit, and I ascend ed and entered my Light. I went up upon my branch and sat there among the Sons of the holy Light. And I withdrew to their dwell ing place which [...] become glorious [...]. Amen. On Fate: Two I am the Word who dwells in the ineffable Voice.

Whereas she (the Mother) alone exists as Silence, I alone am the Word, ineffable, unpol luted, immeasurab le, inconceivable. It (the Word) is a hidde n Light, bearing a fruit of life, pouring forth a living water from the invisible, unpol luted, immeasurable spring, that is, the unreproduci ble Voice of the glory of the Mother, the glory of the offspr ing of God; a male virgin by virtue of a hidden Intellect, that is, the Silence hidde n from the All, being unreproducible, an immeasurable Light, the source of the All, the root of the entire Aeon. It is the foundation that suppor ts every movement of the Aeons that belong to the mighty glory. It is the foundatio n of every foundation . It is the breath of the powers. It is the eye of the three permanen ces, which exist as Voice by virtue of Thought. And it is a Word by virtue of Speech; it was sent to illumine those who dwell in the darkness. Now behold!

Robinson, ed., The Nag Hammadi Library , revised edition. HarperCollins, San Francis co, 1990. Seeing that everybody, gods of the world and manki nd, says that nothing existed prior to chaos, I, in distin ction to them, shall demonstrate that they are all mistaken, because they are not acquainted with the origi n of chaos, nor with its root. Here is the demonstration. How well it suits all men, on the subject of chaos, to say that it is a kind of darkness! But in fact it comes from a shadow, which has been called by the name 'darkness'. And the shadow comes from a product that has existed since the begin ning. It is, moreover, clear that it existed before chaos came into being, and that the latter is posterior to the first product. Let us therefore concern ourse lves with the facts of the matter; and furtherm ore, with the first product, from which chaos was projected. And in this way the truth will be clearly demonstrated. After the natural structure of the immortal beings had comple tely developed out of the infinite, a likeness then emanated from Pistis (Faith ); it is called Sophia (Wisdom ). It exercised volition and became a product resembl ing the primeva l light. And immediately her will manifested itself as a likeness of heaven , having an unimaginable magnitude; it was between the immorta l beings and those things that came into being after them, like [...]: she (Soph ia) functioned as a veil dividing mank ind from th e things above. Now the eternal realm (aeon) of truth has no shadow outside it, for the limitless light is everywhere within it. But its exterior is shadow, which has been called by the name 'darkness'. From it, there appeared a force, presiding over the darkness. And the forces that came into being subsequent to them called the shadow 'the limitless chaos'. From it, every kind of divinity sprouted up [...] together with the entire place, so that also, shadow is posterior to the first product. It was <in> the abyss that it (shadow) appeared, deriving from th e aforementioned Pistis. Then shadow perceived there was somethin g mightier than it, and felt envy; and when it had become pregnant of its own accord, suddenly it engendered jealousy. Since that day, the principle of jealousy among st all the eternal realms and their worlds has been apparent. Now as for that jealousy, it was found to be an abortio n without any spirit in it. Like a shadow, it came into existence in a vast watery substan ce. Then the bile that had come into being out of the shadow was thrown into a part of chaos. Since that day, a watery substance has been apparent. And what sank within it flowed away, being visible in chaos: as with a woman giving birth to a child - all her superfluities flow out; just so, matter came into being out of shadow, and was projected apart. And it did not depart from chaos; rather, matter was in chaos, being in a part of it. And when these things had come to pass, then Pistis came and appeared over the matter of chaos, which had been expelle d like an aborted fetus - since there was no spirit in it. For all of it (chaos ) was limitless darkness and bottom less water. Now when Pistis saw what had resulted from her defect, she became disturbed. And the disturba nce appeared, as a fearful product; it rushed to her in the chaos. She turned to it and blew into its face in the abyss, which is below all the heaven s. And when Pistis Sophia desired to cause the thing that had no spirit to be formed into a likeness and to rule over matter and over all her forces, there appeared for the first time a ruler, out of the waters, lion-like in appearance, androgynous, having great authority within him, and ignorant of whence he had come into being. Now when Pistis Sophia saw him moving about in the depth of the waters, she said to h im, \"Child, pass through to here,\" whose equivalent is ' yalda baoth '. Since that day, there appeared the principle of verbal expressi on, which reached the gods and the angels and manki nd. And what came into being as a result of verbal expression, the gods and the - 2 8 4 -"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"angels and mankind finished. Now as for the ruler Yaltabaoth, he is ignora nt of the force of Pistis: he did not see her face, rather he saw in the water the likeness that spoke with him. And because of that voice, he called himse lf 'Yalda baoth'. But 'Ariael' is what the perfect call him, for he was like a lion. Now when he had come to have authority over matter, Pistis Sophia withdrew up to her light. When the ruler saw his magnitude - and it was only himsel f that he saw: he saw nothing else, except for water and darkness - then he suppos ed that it was he alone who existed. His [...] was completed by verbal expression: it appear ed as a spirit moving to and fro upon the waters. And when that spirit appear ed, the ruler set apart the watery substance. And what was dry was divided into another place. And from matter, he made for himsel f an abode, and he called it 'heaven'. And from matter, the ruler made a footstool, and he called it 'earth'. Next, the ruler had a thoug ht - consisten t with his nature - and by means of verba l expres sion he created an androgyne. He opened his mouth and cooed to him. When his eyes had been opened, he looked at his father, and he said to him, \"Eee!\" Then his father called him Eee-a-o ('Yao'). Next he created the second son. He cooed to him. And he opened his eyes and said to his father, \"Eh!\" His father called him 'Eloai'. Next, he created the third son. He cooed to him. And he opened his eyes and said to his father, \"Asss!\" His father called him 'Astap haios'. These are the three sons of their father. Seven appeared in chaos, androgynous. They have their masculine names and their feminine names. The feminine name is Pronoia (Forethoug ht) Sambathas, which is 'we ek'. And his son is called Yao: his feminine name is Lordship. Sabaoth: his feminine name is Deity. Adonaios: his feminine name is Kingship. Elaios : his feminine name is Jealousy. Oraios: his feminine name is Wealth. And Astaphaios: his feminine name is Sophia (Wisdom). These are the seven forces of the seven heavens of chaos. And they were born androgynous, consistent with the immortal pattern that existed before them, according to the wish of Pistis: so that the likeness of what had existed since the beginning might reign to the end. You will find the effect of these names and the force of the male entities in the Archange lic (Book) of the Proph et Moses , and the names of the female entiti es in the first Book of Nor aia . Now the prime parent Yaldab aoth, since he posses sed great authoriti es, created heavens for each of his offspring throug h verbal expression - created them beautif ul, as dwelling places - and in each heave n he created great glories, seven times excellent. Thrones and mansions and temples, and also chariots and virgin spirits up to an invisible one and their glories, each one has these in his heaven ; mighty armies of gods and lords and angels and archan gels - countless myriads - so that they might serve. The account of these matters you will find in a precise manner in the first Account of Oraia . And they were completed from this heave n to as far up as the sixth heaven, namely that of Soph ia. The heaven and his earth were destroyed by the troublemaker that was below them all. And the six heavens shook violently; for the forces of chaos knew who it was that had destroyed the heave n that was below them. And when Pistis knew about the breakage resulting from the disturbance, she sent forth her breath and bound him and cast him down into Tartaros. Since that day, the heave n, along with its earth, has consolidated itself through Sophia the daughter of Yaldabaot h, she who is below them all. Now when the heaven s had consolidated themselves along with their forces and all their admini stration, the prime parent became insolent. And he was honored by all the army of angels. And all the gods and their angels gave blessing and honor to him. And for his part, he was delighted and continually boasted, saying to them, \"I have no need of anyone.\" He said, \"It is I - 2 8 5 -"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"who am God, and there is no other one that exists apart from me.\" And when he said this, he sinned against all the immortal beings who give answer. And they laid it to his charge. Then when Pistis saw the impie ty of the chief ruler, she was filled with anger. She was invisible. She said, \"You are mistaken, Samael,\" (that is, \"blind god\"). \"There is an immortal man of light who has been in existence before you, and who will appea r among your modelled forms; he will trample you to scorn, just as potter's clay is pounded. And you will descend to your mother, the abyss, along with those that belon g to you. For at the consummatio n of your (pl.) works, the entire defect that has become visible out of the truth will be abolished, and it will cease to be, and will be like what has never been.\" Saying this, Pistis revealed her likeness of her greatness in the waters. And so doing, she withdrew up to her light. Now when Sabaoth, the son of Yaldabaoth, heard the voice of Pistis, he sang praises to her, and he condemned the father [...] at the word of Pistis; and he praised her because she had instructed them about the immortal man and his light. Then Pistis Sophia stretched out her finger and poured upon him some light from her light, to be a condemnation of his father. Then when Sabaoth was illumined, he received great authority against all the forces of chaos. Since that day he has been called \"Lord of the Forces\". He hated his father, the darkness , and his mother, the abyss, and loathed his sister, the though t of the prime parent, which move d to and fro upon the waters. And because of his light, all the authorit ies of chaos were jealous of him. And when they had become disturbed, they made a great war in the seven heavens. Then when Pistis Sophia had seen the war, she dispatched seven archa ngels to Sabaoth from her light. They snatched him up to the seventh heave n. They stood before him as attend ants. Furthermore, she sent him three more archan gels, and establ ished the kingdom for him over everyone, so that he might dwel l above the twelve gods of chaos. Now when Sabaoth had taken up the place of repose in return for his repentanc e, Pistis also gave him her daughter Zoe (Life), together with great author ity, so that she might instruc t him about all things that exist in the eighth heaven. And as he had authority, he made himsel f first of all a mansion . It is huge, magn ificent, seven times as great as all those that exist in the seven heavens. And before his mansion he created a throne, which was huge and was upon a four-faced chariot called \"Cherubin\". Now the Cherubin has eight shapes per each of the four corners, lion forms and calf forms and human forms and eagle forms, so that all the forms amount to sixty- four forms - and seven archange ls that stand before it; he is the eighth, and has authority. All the forms amount to seventy-two. Furtherm ore, from this chariot the seventy-two gods took shape; they took shape so that they might rule over the seventy -two langua ges of the peoples. And by that throne he created other, serpent- like angels, called \"Seraphin\", which praise him at all times. Thereafte r he created a congregation of angels, thousan ds and myriads, numberless, which resembled the congregation in the eighth heaven ; and a firstborn called Israel - which is, \"the man that sees God\"; and anoth er being, called Jesus Christ, who resembles the savior above in the eighth heave n, and who sits at his right upon a revered throne. And at his left, there sits the virgin of the holy spirit, upon a throne and glorifying him. And the seven virgins stand before her, [...] possessing thirty harps, and psalteries and trumpets, glorifying him. And all the armies of the angels glorify him, and they bless him. Now where he sits is upon a throne of light <within a> great cloud that covers him. And there was no one with him in the cloud except Sophia <the daugh ter of> Pistis, instruct ing him about all the things that exist in the eighth heaven , so that the likenes ses of those things might be created, in order that his reign might endure until the consumm ation of the heave ns of chaos and their forces. Now Pistis Sophia set him apart from th e darkness and summoned him to her right, and the prime parent she put at her left. Since that day, right has been called justice, and left called wicked ness. Now because of this, they all received a realm in the congregation of justice and wickednes s, [...] stand [...] upon a creature [...] all. Thus, when the prime parent of chaos saw his son Sabaoth and the glory that he was in, and perceived that he was greatest of all the authorit ies of chaos, he envied him. And having become wrathful, he engendered Death out of his death: and he (viz., Death) was established over the - 2 8 6 -"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"sixth heave n, <for> Sabaoth had been snatched up from there. And thus the number of the six authorit ies of chaos was achieved. Then Death, being androg ynous, mingled with his (own) nature and begot seven androgynous offspring. These are the names of the male ones: Jealousy, Wrath, Tears, Sighing, Sufferi ng, Lamentation, Bitter Weeping. And these are the names of the female ones: Wrath, Pain, Lust, Sighing, Curse, Bitterness, Quarrelsomen ess. They had interc ourse with one another, and each one begot seven, so that they amount to forty-nine androgynous demons. Their names and their effects you will find in the Book of Solomon . And in the presence of these, Zoe, who was with Sabaoth, created seven good androgynous forces. These are the names of the male ones: the Unenvious, the Blessed, the Joyful, the True, the Unbegrudg ing, the Beloved, the Trustworthy. Also, as regards the female ones, these are their names: Peace, Gladness, Rejoicing, Blessedness, Truth, Love, Faith (Pistis). And from these are many good and innocent spirits. Their influences and their effects you will find in the Configurations of the Fate of Heaven That Is Beneath the Twelve . And having seen the likeness of Pistis in the waters, the prime parent grieved very much, especially when he heard her voice, like the first voice that had called to him out of the waters. And when he knew that it was she who had given a name to him, he sighed. He was ashamed on account of his transgressio n. And when he had come to know in truth that an immortal man of light had been existing before him, he was greatly disturbed; for he had previous ly said to all the gods and their angels, \"It is I who am god. No other one exists apart from me.\" For he had been afraid they might know that another had been in existence before him, and might condem n him. But he, being devoid of understanding, scoffed at the condemn ation and acted recklessly. He said, \"If anythi ng has existed before me, let it appear, so that we may see its light.\" And immediatel y, behold! Light came out of the eighth heaven above and passed through all of the heave ns of the earth. When the prime parent saw that the light was beautiful as it radiated, he was amazed. And he was greatly asham ed. As that light appeared, a human likeness appeared within it, very wonderf ul. And no one saw it except for the prime parent and Pronoia, who was with him. Yet its light appeared to all the forces of the heavens. Because of this they were all troub led by it. Then when Pronoi a saw that emissary, she became enamored of him. But he hated her because she was on the darkness . But she desired to embrace him, and she was not able to. When she was unabl e to assuage her love, she poured out her light upon the earth. Since that day, that emiss ary has been called \"Adam of Light,\" whose rendering is \"the luminous man of blood,\" and the earth spread over him, holy Adaman, whose renderin g is \"the Holy Land of Adamantine.\" Since that day, all the authorities have honored the blood of the virgin. And the earth was purifi ed on account of the blood of the virgin. But most of all, the water was purifi ed through the likeness of Pistis Sophia, who had appeared to the prime parent in the waters. Justly, then, it has been said: \"through the waters. \" The holy water, since it vivifies the all, purif ies it. Out of that first blood Eros appeared, being androgy nous. His masculinity is Himireris, being fire from the light. His femininity that is with him - a soul of blood - is from the stuff of Pronoia. He is very lovely in his beauty, having a charm beyond all the creatures of chaos. Then all the gods and their angels, when they beheld Eros, became enamored of him. And appearing in all of them, he set them afire: just as from a single lamp many lamps are lit, and one and the same light is there, but the lamp is not diminished. And in this way, Eros became dispersed in all the created beings of chaos, and was not dimin ished. Just as from the midpoint of light and darkness Eros appeared and at the midpoint of the angels and mankind the sexual union of Eros was consummated, so out of the earth the primal pleasure blossomed. The woman followed earth. And marriage followed woman. Birth followed marriage. Dissolution followed birth. After that Eros, the grapevine sprouted up out of that blood, which had been shed over the earth. Because of this, those who drink of it conceive the desire of sex ual union. After the grapevin e, a fig tree and a pomegranate tree sprouted up from the earth, together with the rest of the trees, all species, having with them their seed from the seed of the authorit ies and their angels. - 2 8 7 -"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Then Justic e created Paradise, being beautif ul and being outside the orbit of the moon and the orbit of the sun in the Land of Wantonness, in the East in the midst of the stones. And desire is in the midst of the beautifu l, appetizin g trees. And the tree of eternal life is as it appeared by God's will, to the north of Paradise, so that it might make eternal the souls of the pure, who shall come forth from the modelled forms of poverty at the consumm ation of the age. Now the color of the tree of life is like the sun. And its branches are beautiful. Its leaves are like those of the cypress. Its fruit is like a bunch of grapes when it is white. Its height goes as far as heaven. And next to it (is) the tree of knowledge ( gnos is ), having the strength of God. Its glory is like the moon when fully radian t. And its branches are beautiful. Its leaves are like fig leaves. Its fruit is like a good appeti zing date. And this tree is to the north of Paradise, so that it might arouse the souls from the torpor of the demons, in order that they might approach the tree of life and eat of its fruit, and so condemn the authorities and their angels. The effect of this tree is described in the Sacred Book , to wit: \"It is you who are the tree of knowledge, which is in Paradise, from which the first man ate and which opened his mind; and he loved his female counterpart and condem ned the other, alien likenesses and loathed them.\" Now after it, the olive tree sprouted up, which was to purify the kings and the high priests of righteous ness, who were to appear in the last days, since the olive tree appear ed out of the light of the first Adam for the sake of the unguent that they were to receive. And the first soul ( psyche ) loved Eros, who was with her, and poured her blood upon him and upon the earth. And out of that blood the rose first sprouted up, out of the earth, out of the thorn bush, to be a source of joy for the light that was to appear in the bush. Moreover, after this the beauti ful, good- smelling flowers sprouted up from the earth, different kinds, from every single virgin of the daughters of Prono ia. And they, when they had become enamored of Eros, poured out their blood upon him and upon the earth. After these, every plant sprouted up from the earth, different kinds, contai ning the seed of the author ities and their angels. After these, the authorities created out of the waters all species of beast, and the reptiles and birds - different kinds - containing the seed of the authorities and their angels. But before all these, when he had appear ed on the first the first day, he remained upon the earth, something like two days, and left the lower Prono ia in heave n, and ascended toward s his light. And immediately darkness covered all the universe. Now when she wished, the Sophia who was in the lower heaven receive d authority from Pistis, and fashioned great luminous bodie s and all the stars. And she put them in the sky to shine upon the earth and to render tempor al signs and seasons and years and months and days and nights and moments and so forth. And in this way the entire region upon the sky was adorn ed. Now when Adam of Light conceived the wish to enter his light - i.e., the eighth heaven - he was unabl e to do so because of the poverty tha t had ming led with his light. Then he created for himsel f a vast eternal realm. And within that eternal realm he created six eternal realms and their adorn ments, six in number, that were seven times better than the heave ns of chaos and their adorn ments. Now all these eternal realms and their adornments exist within the infinity that is betwee n the eighth heave n and the chaos below it, being counted with the universe that belongs to poverty. If you want to know the arrangement of these, you will find it written in the Sevent h Universe of the Proph et Hieralias . And before Adam of Light had withdrawn in the chaos, the authorit ies saw him and laughed at the prime parent because he had lied when he said, \"It is I who am God. No one exists before me.\" When they came to him, they said, \"Is this not the god who ruined our work?\" He answe red and said, \"Yes. If you do not want him to be able to ruin our work, come let us create a man out of earth, accord ing to the image of our body and according to the likeness of this being, to serve us; so that when he sees his likeness, he might become enamored of it. No longer will he ruin our work; rather,we shall make those who are born out of the light our servants for all the duration of this eternal realm.\" Now all of this came to pass accordi ng to the forethoug ht of Pistis, in order that man should appear after his likeness, and should condem n them because of their model led form. And their modelled form became an enclosure of the light. - 2 8 8 -"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Then the authorit ies received the know ledge ( gnosis ) necessary to create man. Sophia Zoe - she who is with Sabaoth - had anticipated them. And she laughed at their decision. For they are blind: against their own interests they ignorantly created him. And they do not realize what they are about to do. The reason she anticipated them and made her own man first, was in order that he might instru ct their modelled form how to despise them, and thus to escape from them. Now the productio n of the instructor came about as follows. When Sophia let fall a droplet of light, it flowed onto the water, and immediately a human being appeared, being androgynous. That droplet she molded first as a female body. Afterwards, using the body she molded it in the likeness of the mother, which had appeared. And he finished it in twelve months. An androgynous human being was produced, whom the Greeks call Hermaphrodit es; and whose mother the Hebrews call Eve of Life (Zoe), namely, the female instructor of life. Her offspr ing is the creature that is lord. Afterwards, the authorit ies called it \"Beast\", so that it might lead astray their model led creatures. The interpretat ion of \"the beast\" is \"the instru ctor\". For it was found to be the wisest of all beings. Now, Eve is the first virgin, the one who without a husband bore her first offspri ng. It is she who served as her own midwife. For this reason she is held to have said: It is I who am the part of my mother; and it is I who am the mother. It is I who am the wife; it is I who am the virg in. It is I who am pregnan t; it is I who am the midwi fe. It is I who am the one that comforts pains of travai l. It is my husba nd who bore me; and it is I who am his mother. And it is he who is my father and my lord. It is he who is my force; What he desi res, he says wit h reason. I am in the process of becom ing; yet I have borne a man as lord. Now these through the will <...> The souls that were going to enter the modelled forms of the authorit ies were manifested to Sabaoth and his Christ. And regarding these, the holy voice said, \"Multiply and improve! Be lord over all creatures.\" And it is they who were taken captive, according to their destin ies, by the prime parent. And thus they were shut into the prisons of the modell ed forms until the consummat ion of the age. And at that time, the prime parent then rendered an opinion concerning man to those who were with him. Then each of them cast his sperm into the midst of the navel of the earth. Since that day, the seven rulers have fashioned man with his body resembling their body, but his likeness resembling the man that had appeared to them. His modelli ng took place by parts, one at a time. And their leader fashioned the brain and the nervous system. Afterwards, he appeared as prior to him. He became a soul-endowed man. And he was called Adam , that is, \"father\", accord ing to the name of the one that existed before him. And when they had finished Adam, he abandoned him as an inanimate vessel, since he had taken form like an abortion, in that no spirit was in him. Regarding this thing, when the chief ruler rememb ered the saying of Pistis, he was afraid lest the true man enter his modelled form and become its lord. For this reason he left his modelled form forty days without soul, and he withdrew and abandoned it. Now on the fortieth day, Sophia Zoe sent her breath into Adam, who had no soul. He began to move upon the ground. And he could not stand up. Then, when the seven rulers came, they saw him and were greatly disturb ed. They went up to him and seized him. And he (viz., the chief ruler) said to the breath within him, \"Who are you? And whence did you come hither?\" It answered and said, \"I have come from the force of the man for the destructio n of your work.\" When they heard, they glorified him, since he gave them respite from the fear and the anxiety in which they found themse lves. Then they called that day \"Rest\", in as much as they had rested from toil. And when they saw that Adam could stand up, they were glad, and they took him and put him in Parad ise. And they withdrew up to thei r heavens. - 2 8 9 -"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"After the day of rest, Sophia sent her daughter Zoe, be ing called Eve, as an instru ctor, in order that she might make Adam, who had no soul, arise, so that those whom he should engender might become contai ners of light. When Eve saw her male counterpart prostrate , she had pity upon him, and she said, \"Adam! Become alive! Arise upon the earth!\" Immediatel y her word became accomplished fact. For Adam, having arisen, suddenly opened his eyes. When he saw her, he said, \"You sha ll be called 'Mother of the Living'. For it is you who have given me life.\" Then the authorit ies were informed that their modelled form was alive and had arisen, and they were greatly troubled. They sent seven archa ngels to see what had happened. They came to Adam . When they saw Eve talking to him, they said to one another, \"What sort of thing is this luminous woman ? For she resembles that likeness which appear ed to us in the light. Now come, let us lay hold of her and cast her seed into her, so that when she becomes soiled she may not be able to ascend into her light. Rather, those whom she bears will be under our charge. But let us not tell Adam, for he is not one of us. Rather let us bring a deep sleep over him. And let us instruct him in his sleep to the effect that she came from his rib, in order that his wife may obey, and he may b e lord over her.\" Then Eve, being a force, laughed at their decision. She put mist into their eyes and secretly left her likeness with Adam. She entered the tree of knowledge and remained there. And they pursued her, and she revealed to them that she had gone into the tree and become a tree. Then, enterin g a great s tate of fear, the blind creatures fled. Afterwards, when they had recovered from the daze, they came to Adam; and seeing the likeness of this woma n with him, they were greatly disturbed, thinking it was she that was the true Eve. And they acted rashly; they came up to her and seized her and cast their seed upon her. They did so wickedly, defiling not only in natural ways but also in foul ways, defiling first the seal of her voice - that had spoken with them, saying, \"What is it that exists before you?\" - intending to defile those who might say at the consummation (of the age) that they had been born of the true man through verbal expression. And they erred, not knowin g that it was their own body that they had defiled: it was the likeness that the authorit ies and their angels defiled in every way. First she was pregnan t with Abel, by the first ruler. And it was by the seven authorities and their angels that she bore the other offspring. And all this came to pass accord ing to the forethoug ht of the prime parent, so that the first mother might bear within her every seed, being mixed and being fitted to the fate of the universe and its configurations, and to Justice. A prearranged plan came into effect regarding Eve, so that the modelle d forms of the authorit ies might become enclosures of the light, whereupon it would condemn them thr ough their modelled forms. Now the first Adam, (Adam ) of Light, is spirit-endowed and appeared on the first day. The second Adam is soul-endowed and appeared on the sixth day, which is called Aphrod ite. The third Adam is a creature of the earth, that is, the man of the law, and he appea red on the eighth day [...] the tranquility of poverty, which is called \"The Day of the Sun\" (Sunday). And the progeny of the earthly Adam became numerous and was complete d, and produce d within itself every kind of scientific informat ion of the soul- endowe d Adam. But all were in ignorance. Next, let me say that once the rulers had seen him and the female creatur e who was with him erring ignora ntly like beasts, they were very glad. When they learned that the immortal man was not going to neglec t them, rather that they would even have to fear the female creature that had turned into a tree, they were disturbe d, and said, \"Perhaps this is the true man - this being who has brought a fog upon us and has taught us that she who was soiled is like him - and so we shall be conquered !\" Then the seven of them together laid plans. They came up to Adam and Eve timidly: they said to him, \"The fruit of all the trees created for you in Paradise shall be eaten; but as for the tree of know ledge, control yourselv es and do not eat from it. If you eat, you will die.\" Having imparted great fear to them, they withdrew up to their authorities. Then came the wisest of all creatures, who was called Beast. And when he saw the liken ess of their mother Eve he said to her, \"What did God say to you? Was it 'Do not eat from the tree of know ledge' ?\" She said, \"He said not only, 'Do not eat from it', but, 'Do not touch it, lest you die.'\" - 2 9 0 -"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"He said to her, \"Do not be afraid. In death you shall not die. For he knows that when you eat from it, your intellect will become sober and you will come to be like gods, recog nizing the difference that obtain s betwee n evil men and good ones. Indeed, it was in jealousy that he said this to you, so that you would not eat from it.\" Now Eve had confidence in the words of the instruc tor. She gazed at the tree and saw that it was beauti ful and appetizing, and liked it; she took some of its fruit and ate it; and she gave some also to her husban d, and he too ate it. Then their intellect became open. For when they had eaten, the light of know ledge had shone upon them. When they clothed themselv es with shame, they knew that they were naked of knowl edge. When they became sober, they saw that they were naked and became enam ored of one another. When they saw that the ones who had modelled them had the form of beasts, they loathed them: they were very aware. Then when the rulers knew that they had broken their commandme nts, they entered Paradise and came to Adam and Eve with earthquake and great threaten ing, to see the effect of the aid. Then Adam and Eve tremb led greatly and hid under the trees in Paradise. Then the rulers did not know where they were and said, \"Adam, where are you?\" He said, \"I am here, for through fear of you I hid, being ashamed.\" And they said to him ignorantly, \"Who told you ab out the shame with which you clothed yourself? - unless you have eaten from that tree!\" He said, \"The woman whom you gave me - it is she that gave to me and I ate.\" Then they said to the latter, \"What is this that you have done?\" She answe red and said, \"It is the instru ctor who urged me on, and I ate.\" Then the rulers came up to the instructor. Their eyes became misty because of him, and they could not do anyth ing to him. They cursed him, since they were powerless. Afterwards, they came up to the woman and cursed her and her offspring. After the woman, they cursed Adam, and the land because of him, and the crops; and all things they had created, they cursed. They have no blessing. Good cannot result from evil. From that day, the authorities knew that truly there was something mighti er than they: they recog nized only that their commandm ents had not been kept. Great jealousy was brought into the world solely because of the immortal man. Now when the rulers saw that their Adam had entered into an alien state of knowledge, they desired to test him, and they gathered together all the domesti c anima ls and the wild beasts of the earth and the birds of heave n and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. When he saw them, he gave names to their creatures. They became troubled because Adam had recovered from all the trials. They assembled and laid plans, and they said, \"Behold Adam! He has come to be like one of us, so that he knows the difference between the light and the darkness. Now perhaps he will be deceived, as in the case of the Tree of Knowledge, and also will come to the Tree of Life and eat from it, and become immortal, and become lord, and despise us and disdain us and all our glory! Then he will denoun ce us along with our universe. Come, let us expel him from Paradise, down to the land from which he was taken, so that hence forth he might not be able to recognize anything better than we can.\" And so they expelled Adam from Paradise, along with his wife. And this deed that they had done was not enoug h for them. Rather, they were afraid. They went in to the Tree of Life and surrounded it with great fearful things, fiery living creatures called \"Cheroub in\", and they put a flaming sword in their midst, fearfully twirling at all times, so that no earthly being might ever enter that place. Thereupon, since the rulers were envious of Adam they wanted to diminish their (viz., Adam's and Eve's) lifespans. They could not (, howe ver,) because of fate, which had been fixed since the beginning. For to each had been allotted a lifespa n of 1,000 years, according to the course of the luminous bodies. But althoug h the rulers could not do this, each of the evildoers took away ten years. And all this lifespan (which remained ) amounted to 930 years: and these are in pain and weakness and evil distractio n. And so life has turned out to be, from that day until the consummation of the age. Thus when Sophia Zoe saw that the rulers of the darkness had laid a curse upon her counterparts, she was indignant. And comin g out of the first heave n with full power, she chased those rulers - 2 9 1 -"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"out of their heave ns, and cast them down into the sinful world, so that there they should dwell , in the form of evil spirits (demon s) upon the earth. [...], so that in their world it might pass the thousand years in Paradise - a soul-endowed living creature called \"phoenix\". It kills itself and brings itself to life as a witness to the judgment against them, for they did wrong to Adam and his generatio n, unto the consummat ion of the age. There are [...] three men, and also his posterities, unto the consummation of the world: the spirit- endowe d of eternity, and the soul-endowe d, and the earthly. Likewise, the three phoen ixes <in> Paradise - the first is immor tal; the second lives 1,000 years; as for the third, it is written in the Sacred Book that it is consumed. So, too, there are three baptisms - the first is the spiritual , the second is by fire, the third is by water. Just as the phoenix appears as a witness concerning the angels, so the case of the water hydri in Egypt, which has been a witness to those going down into the baptism of a true man. The two bulls in Egypt posse ss a mystery, the sun and the moon, being a witness to Sabaoth: namely, that over them Sophia received the universe; from the day that she made the sun and the moon , she put a seal upon her heaven, unto eternity. And the worm that has been born out of the phoeni x is a human being as well. It is writte n (Ps 91:13 LXX) conce rning it, \"the just man will blossom like a phoenix\". And the phoeni x first appears in a living state, and dies, and rises again, being a sign of what has become appar ent at the consummation of the age. It was only in Egypt that these great signs appeared - nowh ere else - as an indication that it is like God's Paradise. Let us return to the aforementioned rulers, so that we may offer some explanat ion of them. Now, when the seven rulers were cast down from their heavens onto the earth, they made for themse lves angels, numerous, demonic, to serve them. And the latter instructed mankind in many kinds of error and magic and potions and worship of idols and spilling of blood and altars and temples and sacrifices and libations to all the spirits of the earth, having their coworker fate, who came into existence by the conc ord between the gods of injustice and justice. And thus when the world had come into being, it distractedl y erred at all times. For all men upon earth worshiped the spirits (demons) from the creation to the consummation - both the angels of righteous ness and the men of unrig hteous ness. Thus did the world come to exist in distraction, in ignoran ce, and in a stupor. They all erred, until the appear ance of the true m an. Let this suffice so far as the matter goes. Now we shall proceed to consideration of our world, so that we may accurately finish the descript ion of its structure and management. Then it will become obvious how belief in the unseen realm, which has been apparent from creation down to the consummat ion of the age, was discovered. I come, therefore, to the main points regarding the immortal man: I shall speak of all the beings that belong to him, explaining how they happen to be here. When a multitude of human beings had come into existence, through the parentage of the Adam who had been fashio ned, and out of matter, and when the world had already become full, the rulers were master over it - that is, they kept it restra ined by ignorance. For what reason? For the following: since the immor tal father knows that a deficiency of truth came into being among st the eternal realms and their universe, when he wished to bring to naught the rulers of perdition through the creatures they had modelled, he sent your likenesses down into the world of perdition, namely, the blessed little innocent spirits. They are not alien to knowledge. For all know ledge is vested in one angel who appear ed before them; he is not without power in the company of the father. And <he> gave them knowledge. Whene ver they appear in the world of perdition, immediately and first of all they reveal the pattern of imperis hability as a condemn ation of the rulers and their forces. Thus when the blessed beings appeared in forms modelled by authorit ies, they were envied. And out of envy the authorities mixed their seed with them, in hopes of polluti ng them. They could not. Then when the blessed beings appeared in luminous form, they appeared in various ways. And each one of them, starting out in his land, revealed his (kind of) knowledge to the visible church constituted of the modell ed forms of perdition. It (viz., the church) was found to contain all kinds of seed, because of the seed of the authoriti es that had mixed with it. - 2 9 2 -"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Then the Savior created [...] of them all - and the spirits of these are manifestly superior, being blessed and varyin g in election - and also (he created) many other beings, which have no king and are superior to everyone that was before them.

These are the seven powers of wrath. 20) They asked the soul, Whence do you com e slayer of men, or where are you goi ng, conqueror of space? 21) The soul answered and said, What binds me has been slain, and what turns me about has been overcome, 22) and my desire has been ended, and ignorance has died. 23) In a aeon I was released from a world, and in a Type from a type, and from the fetter of oblivion which is transie nt. 24) From this time on will I attain to the rest of the time, of the season, of the aeon, in silence. Chapt er 9 1) When Mary had said this, she fell silent, since it was to this point that the Savior had spoken with her. - 2 9 5 -"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"2) But Andrew answered and said to the brethren, Say what you wish to say about what she has said. I at least do not believe that the Savior said this. For certainly these teachings are strange ideas. 3) Peter answered and spoke con cerning these same thi ngs. 4) He questioned them about the Savior: Did He really speak private ly with a woman and not openly to us? Are we to turn about and all listen to her? Did He prefer her to us? 5) Then Mary wept and said to Peter, My brother Peter, what do you think? Do you think that I have though t this up myself in my heart, or that I am lying about the Savior ? 6) Levi answered and said to Peter, Peter you have always been hot tempered. 7) Now I see you contending against the woman like the adversaries. 8) But if the Savior made her worthy, who are you indeed to reject her? Surely the Savior knows her very well. 9) That is why He loved her more than us. Rather let us be ashamed and put on the perfect Man, and separate as He commanded us and preach the gospel , not laying down any other rule or other law beyond what the Savior said. 10) And when they heard this they began to go for th to procla im and to preac h. The Gos pel Accord ing to Mar y About the Papyrus Berolinensis 8502 Papy rus Berol inen sis 8502 was acquired by a German scholar, Dr. Carl Reinhardt, in Cairo in 1896 (the codex is variably referenced in scholar ly writings as the \"Berlin Gnostic Codex\", the \"Akhmim Codex\", PB 8502, and BG 8502). It contains Coptic editio ns of three very important Gnosti c texts: the Apocryphon of John , the Sophia of Jesus Christ , and the Gospel of Mary. Despite the importan ce of the find, several misfortun es (including two world wars) delayed its publication until 1955. By then the Nag Hammad i collection had also been recovered, and two of the texts in the PB 8502 codex -- the Apocry phon of John , and the Sophia of Jesus Chri st -- were also found included there. The PB 8502 versions of these two texts were used to augment translations of the Apocry phon of John and the Sophia of Jesus Chri st as they now appe ar in the Nag Hammad i Library . Importa ntly, the codex preserves the most complete surviving copy of the Gospel of Mary (as the text is named in the manuscript , though it is clear this named Mary is the person we call Mary of Magdala ). Two other small fragments of the Gospel of Mary from separate Greek editio ns were later also unearthed in archaelogical excavat ions at Oxyrhyn chus in Northern Egypt. (Fragments of the Gospel of Thomas were also found at this ancient library site, see the Gospel of Thomas page for more in formati on about Oxyrhyn cus.) Unfortunately, the extant manuscr ipt of the Gospe l of Mary is missing pages 1 to 6 and pages 11 to 14 -- pages that included sections of the text up to chapter 4, and portions of chapter 5 to 8. The complete extant text of the Gospel of Mary is presented below. For those interested in a print edition of the text, we highly recommend Karen King's new translation and commenta ry (listed to the side). An introductory lecture on the The Gospel of Mary Magdalen is also available in our The Gnosis Archive Web Lectures collection. - 2 9 6 -"}]
