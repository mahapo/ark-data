In a matter of so great difficulty every possible liability to error should be eliminated, and it stands to reason that the translation of a translation must needs be but an apology for a first-hand version. Nevertheless I am not without predecessors. The Coptic MS. itself is in the first place a trans- lation, so that even Coptic scholars must give us the version of a translation. I am persuaded also that the anonymous and very imperfect French translation (1856) in th e Appendix to Migne’s Dictionnaire des Apocryphes (vol. i.) is made from Schwartze’s Latin version (1851) and not from the Coptic text. C. W. King in The Gnostics and their Remains (2nd ed., 1887) has also translated a number of pages of the Pistis Sophia from Schwartze. Some three or four years ago Mr. Nutt, King’s publisher, sent out a notice proposing the publication of the whole of King’s translation,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"PISTIS SOPHIA xviii but the project fell through. Last year (1895) I offered to edit this transl ation of King’s, but was informed that the literar y legatee of the deceased scholar was of the opinion that it would be unfair to his memory to publish a MS. that was in so incomplete a condition. “ In 1890 I had already translated Schwartze’s Latin version into English and published pages 1 to 252, with comments, notes, etc., in magazine- form from April 1890 to April 1891. But I hesitated to put it forward in book-form, and should not have done so, but for the appearance of Amélineau’s French tr anslation in 1895. I then went over the whole again and checked it by Amélineau’s version. I was further induced to venture on this undertaking, because the narra- tive, though dealing with mystical and therefore obscure subjects, is in itself exceedingly simple, and therefore mistakes cannot so readily creep in as into a difficult philosophical work. I, there- fore, present my translation with all hesitation, but at the same time think that the English public, which is steadily increasing its interest in mysticism and allied subjects, will be better satisfied with half a loaf than with no bread.” A quarter of a century has rolled away; much water has flowed under the bridges of scholarly research whence the general stream of Gnostic- ism has been surveyed with greater accuracy, and much good work been done on the special subject of the Coptic Gnostic documents. Though the first edition of this book was quickly exhausted and many requests were made for a second, I"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PREFACE xix had hitherto refused to accede to this demand, still hoping that some English Cop tic scholar would take the matter in hand. Indeed, at one time I was in high expectation that this would be achieved. Shortly be fore the War a friend, whom I had interested in the work, completed a version of the fine Untitled Apocalypse of the Bruce Codex, and was next to have attempted a translation of the P.S. But pressing interests and activities of a totally different nature con- nected with the War and its aftermath have absorbed all my friend’s energies, and the version of the P.S. has been definitely abandoned. Nor can I hear of any other project of translation. This being the case, and as the utility of even a translation of a translation is evidenced by the keen demand for the volume in the second- hand market, I have at last decided to repeat my venture. Nevertheless a reprint of the first edition was not to be thought of. Introduction and trans- lation needed revision in the light of twenty-five years’ further study of the work of specialists. To this end the most valuable help, not to speak of his long labours on the allied documents, is afforded by Carl Schmidt’s admirable German translation of the P.S. (1905). Schwartze’s Latin translation was good for its date (1851), and scholars still quote it to-day; Amélineau’s French rendering (1895) was some- what of an improvement; but Schmidt’s version is unquestionably the best. I have therefore revised my prior Englishing from the former"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PISTIS SOPHIA xx two by the finer work of the latter. Schmidt is exceedingly careful throughout, and not only have I taken his decision where Schwartze and Amélineau differ, but have generally preferred him for consistency in phrasing. In my humble opinion it will be long before we have a better rendering than that of this ripe Coptic scholar. But not only has the Translation been thor- oughly revised; the Introduction has been entirely rewritten and the Annotated Biblio- graphy corrected and brou ght up to date. The second edition is practically a new book. The Schwartze-Petermann marginal pagination, which is the usual scheme of reference, and which in the first edition was shown in brackets in the text, is now indicated at the side of the page. I have also adopted Schmidt’s division into chapters as an additional convenience for more general reference, and have numbered the verses of the Psalms and of the Odes of Solomon for easier comparison with the Repentances and Songs of Sophia. It should, of course, be under- stood that the detailed paragraphing does not exist in the original, which runs on for the most part monotonously without break. G. R. S. M. K ENSINGTON , July 1921."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" xxi INTRODUCTION T HE unique MS. of the Coptic Gnostic document commonly called ‘ Pistis Sophia ’ was bought by the British Museum in 1785 from the heirs of Dr. Askew, and is now catalogued as MS. Add. 5114. The title on the back of the modern binding is ‘ Piste Sophia Coptice .’ On top of the first page of the MS. is the signature ‘ A. Askew, M.D.’ On the first page of the binding is the following note, probably in the hand of Woide, the most famous Coptic scholar of those days and Librarian of the Museum: “ Codex dialecti Superior is Ægypti, quam Sahi- dicam seu Thebaidicarn vo cant, cujus titulus exstat pagina 115: Pmeh snaou ń tomos ń tpiste Sophia—Tomos secundus fidel is Sapientiæ—deest pagina 337-344.” The title ‘ Piste Sophia ’ is incorrect. Nowhere is this form found in the very numerous instances of the name in the text, and the hastily suggested ‘ emendation ’ of Dulaurier and Renan to read ‘ Piste Sophia ’ thoughout has perforce received no support. Woide, in a letter to Mich aelis (Bibliography, 4), says that Askew bousht the MS. from a book- seller (apparently in London); its previous The Askew Codex."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"PISTIS SOPHIA xxii history is unknown. Crum informs us in an official description (Bib. 46, p. 173) that at the end of a copy in the B.M. of the sale-catalogue of Askew’s MSS. is the entry: ‘ Coptic MS. £10. 10. 0.,’ and that this refers presumably to our Codex—a good bargain indeed ! The best descriptions of the MS. are by Schmidt (Introd. to his Trans., Bib. 45, pp. xi f.), and Crum ( l.c .). The Codex is of parchment and contains 178 leaves = 356 pages 4to (8¾ × 6½ in.). The writing is in two columns of from 30 to 34 lines each. There are 23 quires in all; but the first has only 12 and the last 8 pages, of which the last page is left blan k. It is; as a whole, in an exceptionally well- preserved state, only 8 leaves being missing (see ch. 143, end). The writing as a whole is the work of two scribes, whose entirely different hands are very clearly distinguishable. The first (MS. pp. 1-22, 196-354) wrote a fine, care ful, old uncial, and the second (MS. pp. 23-195) in comparison a careless, clumsy hand with signs of shakiness which S. thinks might suggest the writing of an old man. They used different inks and different methods both of paging and correction, not to speak of other peculiarities. These scribes must have been contemporaries and divided the task of copying fairly equally between them . So far Crum and Schmidt are in complete agreement; they differ only as to the handwriting of a note on MS. p. 114, col. 2, of the superscription on p. 115 and of the last page (see pp. 105, 106 and 325 of Trans.). The Scripts."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xxiii From an external point of view the contents fall into 4 main Divisions, generally referred to as Books i.-iv. i. The first extends to the end of ch. 62, where in the MS. more than a column and a half has been left blank, and a short, but entirely irrelevant, extract has b een copied on to the second column, presumably from some other book of the general allied literature. There is no title, either superscription or sub- scription, to this Div. Why the second scribe left a blank here in his copying is a puzzle, for the text which follows on MS. p. 115 runs straight on without a break of subject or incident. ii. The next page is headed ‘ The Second Book (or Section) of Pistis Sophia.’ Crum assigns this superscription to the second hand, and the short extract on the second column of the pre- ceding page to the first. But Schmidt thinks that both are later additions by another hand, and this is borne out both by the colour of the ink and also by the very important fact that the older Coptic MSS. have the title at the end and not at the beginning of a volume, conserving the habit of the ancient roll-form. And as a matter of fact we find at the bottom of MS. p. 233, col. 1, the subscription: ‘ A Portion of the Books (or Texts) of the Saviour’ (see end of ch. 100). iii. There follows a short piece on the Gnosis of the Ineffable (ch. 101), which is without any setting and entirely breaks the order of sequence of ideas and is the end of a larger whole. It is clearly an extract from another ‘ Book.’ The Con- tents."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"PISTIS SOPHIA xxiv After this again with ch. 102 we have a very distinct change of subject, though not of setting, from the ending of ii., so that, in my opinion, it is difficult to regard it as an immediate continua- tion. Later, at ch. 126, occurs another abrupt change of subject, though not of setting, preceded by a lacuna in the text. At the end of ch. 135 (bottom of MS. p. 318, col. 1) we have again the subscription: ‘ A Portion of the Books of the Saviour.’ iv. The last piece has no title, either superscrip- tion or subscription. From the change of setting in its introduction and the nature of its con- tents it is generally assigned to an earlier phase of the literature. Here again a complete change of subject occurs with ch. 14 4, after a lacuna of 8 leaves. Finally, on the la st page is an appendix, somewhat in the style of the Mark-conclusion, beginning quite abruptly in the middle of a sentence and presumably part of a larger whole. The contents, measuremen ts and writing make it almost certain that it formed no part of the original copy. At the very end two lines sur- rounded by ornamentation are erased. These may have contained the names of the owner or scribes, or possibly a general subscript title. From the above indications and from a detailed study of the contents it is evident that, though the episode of the adventures of Pistis Sophia, her repentances and songs and their solutions (chh. 30-64), occupy much space; it is by no means the principal them e of the collection; it is rather an incident. The blundering heading of a The Title."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xxv later scribe, ‘The Second Book of Pistis Sophia,’ some two-thirds of the way through this episode, has misled earlier scholars and set up the bad habit of referring to the whole document as the ‘Pistis Sophia’—a habit it is now too late to change. If there is any general title to be derived from the MS. itself, it should be rather ‘ A Portion ’ or ‘ Portions of the Books of the Saviour.’ Whether this title can be made to cover Div. iv. is an open question. In any case we have before us extracts from a more extensive literature which belonged to the same group, and of which there were at least two strata. The contents of the Askew Codex are thus a collection or a miscellany, and not a single con- sistent work. It is very difficult, therefore, to distinguish the contents by any consistent nomen- clature. I have followed the usual custom of calling the whole ‘Pistis Sophia,’ and let Divv. i. and ii. stand as Books i. and ii., as is usually done, though this is clearly improper, judged from the point of view of contents. Thereafter I have distinguished the extracts in Div. iii. as being from two different ‘Books’ (apart from the short insertion at the beginning), and again those in Div. iv. as being from two different ‘Books,’ these ‘Books’ meaning simply subdivisions of or excerpts from larger wholes. It seems highly probable that our scribes did not do the extracting themselves, but found it already done in the copy which lay before them. The date of our MS. is undecided, owing to the difficulty of making exact judgments in The Date of the MS."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"PISTIS SOPHIA xxvi Coptic paleography. The general view assigns it with Schmidt to the 5th century. It may be noted that Woide (Bib. 3) assigned it to the 4th, and Crum seems to agree with him. Hyvernat (Bib. 21) suggests the 6th, and Wright (Bib. 16) the 7th. Amelineau (Bib. 35) goes to a ridi- culous extreme by placing it in the 9th or 10th century, but his too radical views have been severely criticized. The Coptic of the P.S. is in pure Sahidic—that is, the dialect of Upper Egypt,—preserving many features of antiquity. It is, however, clearly not the original language in which the extracts were written. These, like the rest of the extant Coptic Gnostic documents, were originally composed in Greek. This is shown by the very large number of Greek words, not only names, but substantives, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and even conjunctions, left untranslated, on well-nigh every page, and this applies to the O.T. and N.T. quotations equally with the rest. The Schwartze-Petermann Latin version preserves ev ery Greek word through- out untranslated, and Schmidt’s German trans- lation invariably adds them in brackets. In the P.S. a large number of abstract qualificative general names of exalted super-æonic orders is given, such as ‘Unapproachables,’ ‘Uncontain- ables,’ which could not possibly be native to Coptic diction. In a number of passages again, where the translator had difficulty, he slavishly follows the Greek construction. Frequently also he gives alternative renderings. The fact of translation from the Greek is well-nigh universally Translated from the Greek."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xxvii acknowledged; and indeed we now possess de- cisive objective proof, for one of the documents in the Berlin Codex, which presents identical linguistic phenomena, lay before Irenæus in its Greek original form (Bib. 47). Nevertheless Granger (Bib. 44) and Scott-Moncrieff (Bib. 56) have questioned this fact of translation, and quite recently Rendel Harri s (Bib. 60), after accepting the general consensus of opinion (Bib. 49), has changed his mind and thinks that the matter should be reinvestigated. None of these scholars, however, has set forth any objective grounds for his opinion. It is difficult to believe that anyone who has laboured through the versions line by line and word by word can have the slightest doubt on the matter. The whole style of the work is foreign to the Coptic idiom, as may be seen from Amélineau’s Introduction to his French version (Bib. 85) , where he writes (p. x): “ Whoever has any knowledge of the Coptic language knows that this idiom is foreign to long sentences; that it is a tongue eminently analytic and by no means synthetic; that its sentences are composed of small cla uses exceedingly precise, and almost independent of each other. Of course all Coptic authors are not equally easy, some of them are even exceedingly difficult to understand; but this much is certain, that. never under any circumstances in Coptic do we come across those periods with complicated incidental sentences, of three or four different clauses, whose elements are synthetically united together so that the sense of the entire sentence cannot. be grasped"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"PISTIS SOPHIA xxviii before we arrive at the last clause. Nevertheless, this is just what the re ader meets with in this work. The sentences are so entangled with incidental and complicated propositions, that often, indeed very often, the Coptic translator has lost the thread, so to say, and made main propositions out of incidental clauses. . . . The one thing that it conclusively proves is that the book was originally written in a learned language.” Amélineau makes rather too much of the abstruse nature of the subject; for, though many passages are transcendental or mystical, neverthe- less the whole is conceived in a narrative or descrip- tive style. There is no attempt at philosophical argument, no really involved logical propositions. We may then take it as sufficiently established that Greek originals underlay the whole contents of the Askew Codex. It is on this basis at any rate that rests every methodical attempt which has hitherto been made to determine the most probable place and date of origin and to discover the school or circle to wh ich the P .S. miscellany can be referred. Amid much else that is uncertain no one has questioned that the immediate place of origin must be sought in an Egyptian environment. In other words, the ‘ Books ’ of the miscellany were all composed or compiled in Egypt, though where precisely it is impo ssible to conjecture. But the clearly Egyptian elements are not the more numerous; moreover, they do not seem to be the most fundamental, but are blended with, or Originals composed in Egypt."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xxix rather superimposed upon, others which clearly did not originate in Egypt. The date of composition is a difficult problem, and is bound up with the more puzzling question of the sect to which the P.S. literature should be ascribed. There is as yet no certainty; it is a matter of cumulative probabilities at best. The earlier view ascribed . the P.S. to Valen- tinus, who died probably about the middle of the 2nd century, or a decade later, or alternatively to an adherent of the Valentinian school. We may call it the 2nd-century theory. A succession of scholars were of this opinion, among whom may be mentioned Woide, Jablonski, La Croze, Dulaurier, Schwartze, Rena n, Revillout, Usener and Amélineau. This earlier view can hardly be said to have been supported by any great show of detailed argument, except by the French Egyptologist and Coptic scholar Amélineau, who was its most stalwart supporter. Seven years prior to his translation of P.S. in 1895, Amelineau devoted 156 pp. of a voluminous essay (Bib. 19), in which he sought to pr ove the Egyptian origins of Gnosticism—a general thesis which can hardly be maintained in the light of more recent research, —to a comparison of the system of Valentinus with that of the P.S. Meantime in Germany, shortly after the appear- ance of Schwartze’s Latin version in 1851, the careful analysis of the system of the P.S. by Köstlin in 1854 gave rise to or confirmed another view. It abandoned the Valentinian origin, and pronounced generally in favour of what may be Date: The 2nd-century Theory.

Köstlin placed the date of the P.S. in the 1st half of the 3rd cen- tury, and Lipsius (Bib. 15) and Jacobi (Bib. 17) accepted his finding. We may call this alterna- tive general view the. Srd-century theory. In 1891 Harnack, accepting Köstlin’s analysis of the system, attacked the problem from another point of view, basing himself chiefly on the use of scripture, as shown in the quotations from the O.T. and N.T., and on the place of the doctrinal ideas and stage of the sacramental practices in the general history of th e development of Chris- tian dogma and rites. He pointed out also one or two other vague indications, such as a reference to persecution, from which he concluded that it was written at a date when the Christians were ‘lawfully’ persecuted. These considerations led him to assign the most probable date of composi- tion to the 3nd half of the 3rd century. Schmidt in 1892 accepted this judgment, with the modifi- cation, however, that Div. iv. belonged to an older stratum of the literature, and should therefore be placed in the 1st half of the century. This general view has been widely adopted as the more probable. In Germany it has been accepted by such well-known specialists as Bousset, Preuschen and Liechtenhan; and in France by De Faye. Among English scholars may be mentioned chiefly E. F. Scott, Scott-Moncrieff and Moffat.

They may just as well, he contends, be compilations from the synop- tics. One clear parallel only can be adduced, and this may be due to a common source. I am not convinced by this criticism; nor do I think it germane to Legge’s ge neral contention, for it is precisely in Valentin ian circles that the fourth gospel first emerges in history. In the Introduction to the first editjon of the present work I registered my ad hesion to the Valentinian hypothesis, but, as I now think, somewhat too precipitously. On general grounds the 3rd-cen- tury theory seems to me now the more probable; but, even if Harnack’s arguments as a whole hold, I see no decisive reason why the P.S. may not equally well fall within the 1st half as within the 2nd half of the century. The question of the sect or even grouping to which the P.S. literature should be assigned is still more difficult. To call it ‘ Ophitic ’ is nebulous at best. Ophitism in Gnosticism is ill- defined, if not chaotic, owing to the confusing indications of the Church Fathers. They called Ophitic or classed as Ophitic very different sects who never used the name for themselves. It ought to mean people either who worshipped the serpent or in whose symbolism or mythology the serpent played the most characteristic or dom- inant rôle .

Sed et serpens is conspicuous by its absence. All that we can legitimately say is that along this confused line of heredity we have to push back our researches in any endeavour to discover the earliest developments of Gnosticism in Christian circles. These took place unquestionably first on Syrian ground, and doubtless had already a long heredity behind them, former phases of syncretism, blendings of Babylonian, Persian, Semitic and other elements. The ‘ Ophitic ’ elements in P.S. are of Syrian origin, but de- veloped on Egyptian soil. If there is also a slight Hellenistic tinging, it is not of a philosophizing nature. Can we, however, find any indications in the P.S. which might be thought to direct us whither to search in the jumble of sects which the chief heresiological Fathers bring into an ‘ Ophitic ’ connection? There are th ree vague pointers: (1) Philip is declared pre-eminently (chh. 22, 42) to be the scribe of all the deeds and discourses of the Saviour, but with him are associated Thomas and Matthew (ch. 48); (2) in Div. iii. Mary Magdalene stands forth as the chief questioner, no less than 39 of the 42 questions being put in her mouth; (3) in Div. iv. a foul act of obscene sorcery is condemned as the most heinous of all sins (ch. 147).

Among the titles of their books reference is made to a Gospel of Philip ( Hær , xxvi. 13) and Questions of Mary , both The Great and The Little ( ib . 8). A quotation is given from the former, and several from the latter. But in both cases they are of an obscene nature and have clearly nothing whatever to to with P.S. in any way. It is true that the more abundant quotations are from The Great Ques- tions , and this has led Harnack and others to assume that The Little Questions may have been of a different and even ascetic character. But Epiphanius classes the two writings together without distinction; and even if the title Questions of Mary could be legitimately given to part of the contents of P.S., surely these would be more appropriately styled The Great and not The Little Questions ? Finally, the document from which Epiphanius quotes belongs to a differint type of setting. Mary questions apart, is alone with Jesus. She is not with the rest of the disciples, as in the P.S. In describing these sects Epiphanius repeatedly dwells on certain unspeakably foul rites and practices which he would have us believe were widely spread among them. P.S. condemns with even greater severity a similar obscene abomi- nation, introducing this stern reprobation with the solemn words, the only instance of such an outbreak in the whole narrative: “ Jesus was wroth with the world in that hour and said unto The liber- tinist Sects of Epi- phanius."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"PISTIS SOPHIA xxxiv Thomas: ‘ Am ē n, I say unto you: This sin is more heinous than all sins and all iniquities.’ ” There is, however, no in dication that in the experience of the writers of the P.S. such a prac- tice was widespread; on the contrary, it would seem for them to have been a rare occurrence— indeed, the most horrible thing of which they had ever heard. If Epiphanius is to be relied on here, it is vain to look for the Gnostics of the P.S. in such an environment. But Epiphanius has no great reputation for accuracy in general, and it is very difficult to believe in such widespread iniquity of so loathsome a nature. In any case he is writing at a later date. Liechtenhan’s hypothesis (Bib. 41), that a certain common body of literature was rewritten—on the one hand to serve libertinist propensities, and on the other in the interest of ascetic tendencies,—though more or less accepted by Harnack, seems to me to be too facile a generalization to meet the special difficulty with which we are confronted. Epi- phanius in his youth had certain unfortunate experiences with the adhere nts of a libertinist sect in Egypt, and the moral s hock it gave him seems to have warped his judgment as a historian in this part of his work; it led him to collect every scrap of evidence of obscenity he could lay hands on and every gross scandal that had come to his ears, and freely to generalize therefrom.

With nothing but Patristic indications before us, no matter what pains are taken to submit them to microscopic cr itical inspection, it seems impossible to place the P. S. precisely. But our Codex does not stand in isolation as the only directly known Christian Gnostic document—that is to say, as coming strai ght from the hands of the Gnostics themselves, though by way of trans- lation. We have first of all the two MSS. of the Bruce Codex in the Bodleian, Oxford. One of these, The Book of the Great Logos according to the Mystery , is closely connected with the litera- ture from which the P.S. miscellany is excerpted, especially with Div. iv. We can say with a high degree of conndence that it belonged to the same tradition, though whether to an earlier or later stratum is not quite decided. There are, however, no indications in it which will further help us as to date or name of sect. The second MS., a lofty apocalypse, which unfortunately bears no title, is of another line; of tradition or type of interest. Schmidt. in the Introduction to his translation (p. xxvi, Bib. 45), thinks he can refer it with certainty to the Sethian-Archontic group, placing it in the 1st half of the Srd century, in- stead of, as previously (Bib. 28), in the last quarter of the 2nd.

On July 16, 1896, Schmidt surprised and de- lighted students of Gnosticism by reporting, at a sitting of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences, on the contents of a precious Coptic Gnostic Codex which had in January of the same year been procured by Dr Reinhardt at Cairo from a dealer in antiquities from Akhm ī m, and is now in the safe custody of the Berlin Egyptian Museum ( Sitzungsberichte d. k. p.

This notice and a more detailed study of one of th e treatises by S. in 1907 (Bib. 47) give us all the information we possess so far concerning this very important Codex. In 1900 I summarized S.’s first notice in the first edition of my Fragments of a Faith Forgotten (pp. 579-592). The Codex consists mainly of three original Greek Gnostic works in Coptic translation: (1) The Gospel of Mary ; (2) The Apocryphon of John ; (3) The Wisdom of Jesus Christ . At the end there is an extract from The Acts of Peter , which are also of Gnostic origin, setting forth an episode from the healing wonders of the Apostle.

The Apocryphon of John is clearly im- bued with a very similar spirit of philosophizing to that of the Valentinian school, and Schmidt promises to compare the two systems in detail, so as to determine their relationship, when he publishes his translation of these new documents, which are of so great importance for the history of the Christianized Gnosis. What precise light the publication of Schmidt’s labours will throw, directly or indirectly, on the puzzling question of the exact placing of the P.S. literature, we must wait to see; it is highly probable, however, that it will throw some light on its problems.

What is certain is that we have in the contents of the Askew, Bruce and Berlin Codices a rich material which hands on to us valuable direct information concerning what I have called ‘ The Gnosis according to its Friends,’ in distinc- tion from what previously used to be our only sources, the polemical writings of the heresiological Fathers, which set forth ‘ The Gnosis according to its Foes.’ We have thus at last a new standpoint from which to review th e subject, and therewith the opportunity of revising our impressions in a number of respects; a considerably different angle of vision must needs change the perspective of no little in the picture. The chief business or in terest of the orthodox Fathers was to select and stress what appeared to them to be the most bizarre points and ele- ments, all that was most absurd in their judg- ment, in the many Gnostic systems, and of course, and rightly, everything that could be thought to be ethically reprehensib le. Good, bad and in- different were only too fre quently lumped together. It was of no interest to this polemic to mention similarities in belief and practice between the heretics and their opponent s, to dwell on the lofty faith of numbers of these Gnostics in the trans- cendent excellence and overmastering glory of the Saviour, or on many signs of spiritual inwardness, and especially of high virtue, in which they were at the least not less scrupulous than their critics.

It is no part of the plan of this translation to attempt anything in the nature of a commentary. That would mean a second volume, and would in any case be an unsatisfactory performance; for much would still remain obscure, even if every ray of light shed on this or that special point by those who have most deeply studied the subject, were gathered together. One or two very general remarks, however, may be ventured. In the P.S. Jesus is everywhere pre-eminent and central. He is here revealed as Saviour and First Mystery, who knows all and unveils all, infinite in compassion. As such he is pre-exis- tent from eternity, and his ministry is not only earthly, but cosmic and supercosmic; indeed, it is the chief feature in the divine economy. Yet nowhere is he called the Christ. If this is inten- tional, no reason seems to be assignable for such an abstention. There is no sign of antagonism to Judaism or to the O.T.

The whole setting is post-resurrectional. In Divv. i.-iii. Jesus has already, for eleven years after the crucifixion, b een instructing his dis- ciples, men and women, in the Gnosis. The scene now depicts the dis ciples as gathered round the Saviour on the Mount of Olives on earth. The range and scope of this prior teaching may be seen in Div. iv., where the introductory words speak of it as taking pla ce simply after the cruci- fixion. In this stratum the scene is different. The sacramental rite is solemnized on earth; it takes place, however, on the Mount of Galilee and not on the Mount of Olives. But the scene is not confined to earth only, for the disciples are also taken into some of the regions of the invisible world, above and below, have vision there con- ferred upon them, and are instructed on its mean- ing. Now in Divv. i.-iii. Jesus promises to take the disciples into the spheres and heavens for the direct showing of their nature and quality and inhabitants, but there is no fulfilment of this promise in the excerpts we have from ‘The Books of the Saviour.’ It is not to be supposed, how- ever, that Div. iv. is part of the fulfilment of the high promise made in the prior extracts; for in it we move in an earlier phase of the instruction and in an atmosphere of lesser mysteries than those indicated in the preceding part.

He ascends into heaven in dazzling light which blinds the disciples. Af ter thirty hours he re- turns again, and in compassion withdraws his blinding splendour, so as to give his final teaching to his faithful in his fam iliar form. This means that ‘ The Books of the Saviour ’ purport to contain not only a post-resurrectional teaching, and therefore a Gnostic revelation supplementary to the public preaching before the crucifixion, but also a still higher and more intimate unveiling within the post-resurrectional instruction already current in the tradition. If there had been apocalyptic elements and visions in the prior literature, there were to be still more transcen- dental revelations now on the completion of the ministry.

It was by W. that the New Testament, according to the text of the famous Codex Alexandrinus, was edited, in uncial types cast to imitate those of the MS., in 1786. In an Appendix to this great undertak ing, in 1799 (see below, 5), he added certain fragments of the New Testament in the Thebaico-Coptic dialect, together with a dissertation on the Coptic version of the New Testam ent. The date of the C.A. is generally assigned to the 5th cent., and, with the exception of the Codex Vaticanus and the Codex Sinaiticus, which are sometimes assigned to the 4th cent., is the oldest extant MS. of the New Testament. This being the case, it is of interest to quote from the Beiträge W.’s opinion on the date of the MS. of P.S., which was lent to this careful scholar by Dr. Askew and which he copied from the first word to the last: “ It [P.S.] is a very old MS. in 4to on parchment in Greek uncial characters, which are not so round as those in the Alexandrine MS. in London, and in the Claromontain MS. in Paris [Codex Regius Parisiensi s, also an Alexandrine text]. The characters of the MS. [P.S.] are somewhat longer and more angular, so that I take them to be older than both the latter MSS., in which the letter s eta, theta, omicron, rho and sigma are much rounder.” Thus W. would date the MS. towards the end of the 4th cent. 4. 1794.

In spite of numerous blemishes this first edition is said to be ‘ an outstanding achievement.’ S. considers the original treatise, as we see from the title ot his work, to have been written by Valentinus; but P. is of the opinion that it is the work of an Ophite, and promises to set fo rth his reasons at length in a treatise, which has unfortunately never seen the light.

He assigns its date to the first half of the 3rd cent., and thinks that it is of Ophite origin. In a note to page 1, K. writes: “ The MS. from which the work is published belongs to the collection of MSS. collected by Dr. Askew of London during his travels in Italy and Greece, of which The British Theo- logical Magazine ( Das Brittische theol.

But R. shows (p. 145) that he has no direct acquaintan ce with the subject. H. assigns the P.S. to an ‘ Ophitic ’ sect, but not the ‘ Ophites ’ in the narrower meaning, for here , as elsewhere often in the use of the name, no sign of the worship of the serpent is found (p. 110). He brings the P. S. sect into close connection with the Syrian Ophitic group, which had offshoots in Egypt, and opens up those investigati ons into the statements of Epiphanius which Schmidt has surv eyed in greater detail in his edition of the Codex Brucianu s (below, 28). In fact these two scholars have been in close touch with one another in their work on the P.S. as to its origin, date and place. The concluding remark of H. on the general religious status of the P.S.—that is to say, its bearing on Early Christian and Catholic religion, in other word s its place within the general history of Christianity—is notewo rthy. He writes (p. 114): “ In this respect the P.S. is a document of first rank, for we possess no second work which brings before our eyes so clearly the previous history, of Catholic sacramentism. What we meet with here more sharply brought out and at one stroke among the Gnostics of the end of the third cen- tury, was accomplished by the Catholic Church toilsomely and gradually in the following ce ntury.

His minute examination of the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY lix original discovered that the chaos could first of all be sorted out into two totally different MSS. The larger work is entitled The Book of the Great Logos according to the Mystery . The contents fall naturally into two divisions, which S. calls respectively ‘ The First ’ and ‘ The Second Book of Jeû.’ The system is closely related to that of the P.S. miscellany. S. devotes pp. 334-538 to a penetr ating study of this relation- ship, in which he makes a most valuable contribution to the analysis of the contents of th e P.S. His labours here are practically an Introduction to hi s subsequent translation of the P.S. in 1905 (below, 45). Among much else of the greatest value he gives us a mi nutely detailed investigation of the system of the P.S., whic h supersedes Köstlin’s pains- taking pioneer effort (1854). S. is rightly of opinion that P.S. is a more or less happy compilation from other works (p. 318), as Köstlin had alread y pointed out (p. 344). He seems to think little of the possible objection that, whereas the ‘ Two Books of Yew,’ mentioned twice in the P.S., are said to have been dictated to Enoch by Jesus before the Flood and hidden away, the contents of the first document of the C.B. are revealed by Jesus himself to the disciples (p. 343). The statement in the P.S. is in keeping with common apocalyptic claims, and in any case the sect as a matter of fact did possess two Yew Books, and the contents of C.B. I. are what we should expect from the references in the P.S., while the intimate relationship between P.S. Div. iv. and C.B. I.b is patent to the most casual reader. He agrees with Harnack as to the date of the P.S.—namely, the latter half of the 3rd cent . for Divv. i.-iii., and a few decades earlier for Div. iv. C.B. I. is thus to be placed in the first half of the 3rd cent. (pp. 540, 598). C.B. II. is a work without a title, the cont ents of which have roused S. to enthusiasm (pp. 34, 35). It is plainly of an earlier date, and so S. here conjectures for it about 160-200 A . D . (p. 542); but he has su bsequently changed his view as to date (see 47, below). After a close methodical invest igation, in which in par- ticular he submits the statements of Epiphanius to a searching criticism, S. thinks that everyt hing points to the Severians as being most probably the sect to which the writings contained in P.S. and C.B. I. can be attributed (p. 596). C.B. II., he concludes, may be assi gned to Sethian-Archontics (p. 659). But the whole question bristles with difficulties when precise names are in question.

These views have been severely criticized, especially by Schmidt. The MS . itself, however, A. places very late, writing on page xi of his Intr oduction as follows:—“ After an examination of the enormous faults which the scribe has committed, I cannot attribute to the MS. which has preserved the Pistis-Sophia to us, a date later than the ninth or tenth century, and that too the minimu m. For this I have several reasons. Firstly, the MS. is written on parchment, and parchment was hardly ever comm only used in Egypt before the sixth or seventh century. Secondly, the writing, which is uncial, though passable in the first pages of the MS., becomes bastard in a large number of leaves, when the scribe’s hand is fatigued; no longer is it the beautiful writing of the Egyptian scribes of the great periods, but slack, inconsistent, almost roun d and hurried. Thirdly, the faults of orthography in the use of Greek words evidently show that the scribe belonged to a period when Greek was almost no longer known.” In a footnote Amelineau says that he is perfectly aware that this opinion of his will ‘ raise a tempest,’ and begs for a suspension of judgment till he has published his reasons, especially as to the late use of parchment, at greater length. The storm broke, and no one has accepted A.’s arguments. Among other things he failed to notice that in the first place the Askew Codex is the work of two scribes, and not of one, and that the various portions of their common task can be unquestionably assigned to each .

This sect was divided into an ascetic and a libertinist branoh, and each group worked over the sacred literature which had come down to them.” Epiphanius ( Hær . xxvi.) got hold of the libertinist redaotion; the asoetic is preserved for us in P.S., Divv. i.-iii.

He says nothing, un- fortunately, of how this docu ment and the other two of the Codex—namely, The Gospel of Mary and The Wisdom of Jesus Christ —bear on the line of descent of the doctrines of the P.S.

Though Lipsius (above, 20) had already drawn attention to the point, B. go es further by showing in detail the close connection between some main notions of the Manichæan religion and some features of the P.S., whereas Schmidt (1892, pp. 375, 404, 417, 564) had previously drawn attention to isolated parallels only. In dealing with the system of the P.S. (pp. 346-350) B. writes: “ There can be no doubt at all on the affinity between the two systems. The only possible question whioh remains is whether in the P.S. and II. Jeû direct dependence on the Manichæan system oomes up for discussion, or whether a common souroe under- lies both systems. The latter appears to me provisionally to be the more probable hypothesis. Many of the kindred ideas appear in the P.S. in th eir more original and purer form, the figure of the Virgin of Light has in the P.S. meaning and great importanoe, whereas in the Maniohman system she is a shadowy form by the side of the Third Envoy.

S.-M. thinks, however, that the question of translation may be presse d too much. Without attempt- ing any justification of his opi nion, he asserts that “ the Coptic text is at the earliest a fifth-century work when Gnosticism was fast dying out and could only be practised furtively.” Surely the author is here confusing the probable date of the Askew Codex copy with the question of date of the original? 57. 1915.

He now thinks that (p. 117): “ Unless . . . the P.S. has substituted the Sahidic [Bible] version for some other version wh ich lay before the author, of which he has avoided the troubl e of making a fresh trans- lation, there is a strong presumption that the P.S. is a genuine Coptic book, and not a rendering of some other work (Greek or Syriac) into Coptic.” He rejects (p. 183) Worrell’s theory (above, 53) of a Gnos tic Hymn- and Psalm-book, and criticizes (pp. 186 f.) Rahlfs’ di scovery of two versions of the Psalms (above, 40).

It cannot, however, be said that his argumen t is in any way convincing. As to the Odes of Solomon themselves, which have pro- duced so large and instructive a literature since the first edition was published, their lucky discoverer and able editor, in reviewing the whole question, thinks we cannot go far wrong if we conclude that they were written at Antioch in the 1st century (p. 69).

For which cause I have said unto you indeed from the be ginning that ye are not of the world. I also am not of it. For all men who are in the world have gotten their souls out of [the power of] the rulers of the æons. But the power which is in you is from me; your souls belong to the height. I have brought twelve powers of the twelve saviours of the Treasury of the Light, taking them out of the portion of my power which | I did first receive. And when I had set forth for the world, I came into the midst of the rulers of the sphere and had the form of Gabri ē l the angel of the æons; and the rulers of the æons did not know me, but they thought that I was the angel Gabri ē l. “ It came to pass then, when I had come into the midst of the rulers of the æons, that I looked down on the world of mankind, by command of the First Mystery. I found Elizabeth, the mother of John the Ba ptizer, before she had conceived him, and I sowed into her a power which I had received from the little Ia ō , the Good, who is in the Midst, that he might be able to make proclamation before me and make ready my way, and baptize with the water of the forgiveness of sins. That power then is in the body of John. “ Moreover in place of the soul of the rulers which he was appointed to receive, I found the soul of the prophet Elias in the æons of the sphere; and I took him thence, and took his soul and brought it to the Virgin of Light, and  12.

So the power of the little Ia ō , who is in the Midst, and the soul of the pro- phet Elias, they were bound into the body of John the Baptizer. For this cause then were ye in doubt aforetime, | when I said unto you: ‘John said: I am not the Christ,’ and ye said unto me: ‘It standeth written in the scripture: When the Christ shall come , Elias cometh before him and maketh ready his way.’ But when ye said this unto me, I said unto you: ‘Elias verily is come and hath made ready all things, as it standeth written, and they have done unto him as they would.’ And when I knew that ye had not understood that I had discoursed with you concerning the soul of Elias which is bound into John the Bap tizer, I answered you in the discourse in openness face to face: ‘If ye like to accept John the Ba ptizer: he is Elias, of whom I have said that he will come.’ ” And Jesus continued again in the discourse and said: “ It came to pass then thereafter, that at the command of the First Mystery I looked down on the world of mankind and found Mary, who is called ‘my mother’ according to the body of matter. I spake with her in the type of Gabri ē l, and when she had turned herself to the height towards me, I cast thence into her the first power which I had received from Barb ē l ō — that is the body which I have borne in the height.

This, my Lord, is the first thought. “ The second thought is on the other hand that. which thou hast just said unto us con- cerning the soul which receiveth the mysteries: ‘ If it cometh into the re gion of the rulers of the way of the midst, they come forth to meet it in exceedingly great fear and they are afraid of it.

These are the solutions of the words which I have spoken.” Mary answered and said: “ Still, my Lord, do I question thee, because from now on I will begin to question thee on all things with sureness.
