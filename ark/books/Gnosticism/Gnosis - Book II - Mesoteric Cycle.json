Bibliography 259 PUBLISHER'S INTRODUCTION I n the French edition of this book, the author's introduction (included in this translation) attempted to answer some of the more persistent ques- tions raised with him after the publication of Volume I. These questions and their answers are most iuterestiag to serious students of these ideas, and particularly ta those who are trying to put the ideas in the book into practice, so that we have included the whole of that introduction jn this translation (See p. xxv below). But times have now changed, and at the present time-since the translation of Volume 1 into English and its final release a little over a year ago - we have found new questions and new misunderstandings coming from the hfference in time and place from those which presided over the birth of the original French edrtion thirty years ago. In spite of the belief in progress that is stiIP held by some people, some things that were clear to readers when the French edition was published are no longer so clear to us today, In some ways the background against which things must be understood bas changed, so that today we must perhaps explain mare about the nature and purpose of this book - and even about the form of its translation - than would have been necessary thirty yars ago. In particuIar it seems necessary to clarify the relarion of this work to two things: to the Orthodox church itself, and to something apparently quite differenr - to what has become known in the past thirty years or so as 'The G~rdjicf work, or the 'Fowth Wq'. TO answer both of these questions we must in turn address a third: the quesrion of an alter- native to monasticism for those devout Christians drawn to true spiritual- ity but whose inner or outer commitments to the everyday world are too binding to allow them to withdraw from the world. Relation to the Church A mong other things it must be made clear that Boris Mouravieffs Gao~i.~ is an attempt to recover and describe, in terms understandable to modern man, aparticddr Trada'tmn handed down over the centuries, in a sometimes perhaps broken linehut one that still exists today in the Orthodox church as that continues amongst the hundreds of millions of Christians in the Orthodox Christian world. This tradition could be said to be the Christian equivalent of Yoga, Zen and the other inner traditions of the far Eastern religions, disciplines which have each existed 1. Them is tvidcnmof this line's havingken reconstructed or rc~onstimttd severaI times in the ppst fifteen hdred gears. (Ed.)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Ls lvithin the religion of which they are part - and which have now become accepted parts of those faiths, something that cannot always be said of their Christian equivalent. Like Yoga and similar tradi- tions, or Iike specitic sciences such as physics in a diRerent context, it is not one system or invention, but has its roots far back ir! the history of religion-according to the text itself of this work, those roots in fact lie in certain statements of Saint Paul, perhaps even of Christ himself, and their development can be traced first through formative figures of the early churches, including key figures who have given shape to the modern Orthodox church, such as Saint Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, and Saint Symeon the New Theologian. It clearly relates to the doctrines expressed in key texts of Eastern spirituality such as the Philokalia, although these tend to emphasize ideas more applicable in a monastic context. Its later form can be traced particularly in the Russian church, which has ever been more willing to speak openly about such things, although it clearly rehtes to the oral tradition known as the Ryal Wq that survives to this day in the main centres of monasticism in the Eastern church. But its specialist character means that it does not claim to be a work of Orthodox theology, nor to reinrerpres Orthodox doctrine per se so much as to express ways of applying that doctrine to specific questions of human spirituality, although in certain places, particularly in this Vo- lume 11, it does raise sometimes challenging interpretations of Theological doctrines. Mouravieff himself admits that the survival of this tradition wjthin the church is tenuous, that the doctrine does not appear to survive in full or has not been collected together in full, although the paint is made by srudents of this tradition that it must be known to a certain degree of completeness before it will serve its proper purpose. Monks on Athos admit the existence of the Tradition but say that it has never been fully spelled out in writing. To be more precise still, the monastic form does appear to survive in certain places, but the additional kncrwledge needed to piogress in everyday life appears to be more dispersed and the importance of this book, in this sense, is the efforts it has made to collect that dispersed information and make it accessible in practical form. Relatio~ to the Fourth Way B 0th Gurdjieff and Ouspensky stated at different times that the practical teachings and methods they taught were a form of nsoteric Cbristiunig. This does not conflict with the idea that many oEGYs methods were learned from Sufi (i.e. Islamic) sources. Even the Old Testament says that: 'The Lord thy God is one God.' And Mouravieff more than once quotes within xiv this work the maxim that 'The Tradition is one.' Mouraviefl several times refers so the Fourth Way within this book, although placing this in context other related 'ways'. But the real point of this is that in-depth study of the text of his Gnosis does produce practical solutions in this conrext as well as in that of 'purely' Christian spirituality. To be more exact, the book opens up to provide exactly whaz it claims, to provide - for those who study it in sufKdent depth-what Mouravieff called a truegnosi~ or true self- bowledge which does four things in particular. It transforms our relation to ourselves-and makes it possible, for example, for us to understand this statement. And this leads into an understanding of what has often been described in terms such as: 'the wq to God is tho@ oneself.' This forms within us a new ability to control the different parts of the mind that until now control us. This in turn gives us sufficient knowkdge of our 'organism' to develop methods for remedying its weaknesses and to understand and properly apply methods previously dtvtIoped for ths pur- pose, And this then gives us ways that can be confirmed in practice of waking the hem or, for those who already possess such ways - new or more complete ways of understanding this and putting it into practice. What then are rhe sources of Mouravi&s knowledge, and what makes it possible to distinguish what in so much of his text is dearly knowledge of a high order from the opinions which, in obedience to his humanity, still do creep in here or there, particularly where he is concerned with ideas about his lost but still beloved Russia? This distinction between knowledge and opinion, so well expressed in Clement of Alexandria's Stmmcztcd, one of MouraviefT's primary sources, was obviously important to him, so that he gives gentle clues both about the nature of the higher knowledge he conveys, and about the ways in which he did introduce new knowledge where needed, as well as the reasons why he did so. There are in fact several ways in which the accuracy of such a text can be verified, and surprisingly, Mouravieff s Gnosis stands up under all these methods of 'assay'. It fits the Orthodox \"dotis' or tradition as expressed by those who still possess the Royal Way described earlier. It evokes the confirmation of inspiration described in Plato's seventh letter. It predicts, in what appears at first to be mere theory, the actual events of the life in the study of Gnosis. It stands the test ofpractice, and in doing so it remains internally consistene. When it does introduce ideas from other traditions, such as the concept of hma, it does so in ways that, properly understood, remain consistent to"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"0verdI statement of the doctrine with a degree of precision equal to that of the mature external sciences, Those who can discriminate between difFerent levels of knowItdge will find in this book an host inexhaustible treasury of knowledge that can lead to true spiritual transformation. But it is necessary first to work for this discrimination, Without it, not only will you be unable to differentiate between gnosis and its imitations, but even this book wd not release its gn0si.r to you in trust. B oris Mouravieff s Gnosis is described on the cwer of each volume as a 'st#& and commentaries orr the Esoteric Tradition ofEastern Orthodoxy'. It is important to be dear what this means, as the idea of esotetieisrn is often misunderstood. The clue can be found in the words of the Gospel of Saint Joh.

What this means is that in those times there was an inner knowledge, based on \"asrenting to' traditional knowledge4 - knosis' - whch is then confirmed experimentally through techniques of inner observation, and a purely external Iund of knowledge, gained through the ordinary senses. A Greek scholar in Boston confirmed this when he wrote recently that there is an external or exoteric Christianity and an internal or esoteric Christianity: 'Thejrxt kind of pbilosoph, externalphiIom)~, colaprises for hen ancient Greek philosop& ~nd the pagan pbilosoptg of ear4 CslriSrian centwies, TAt secod kind, \"i#kma~phi~asopby\", is identical with the Cbrisdian religion, Tbiz term is used to ddeote Orthodox Christian teaching in it^ totdig; iiued Cbristiafi tacbit~g in getleral; some kkriorpruc#ice,parfic~~rlr& her attention and inner ~filiness, affd the monustit Over the years, this esotericism has formed a Tradition, a science or discipline of knowledge which may have existed before the time of Christ, 2.

Boris Mouravieff says in his own introduction to the present volume that: %S Tradition, whch in Antiquity was only revealed in the ~~~teries under the seal of absolute secrecy, passed from Egypt to Judaea with Moses, and to Greece with Orpheus and Pythagotas. The preaching the Apostles fused these two currents in the Empire of the East, from w~ch the Tradition scattered at that time towards Russia.' Time after time, people try to interpret the whole of this inner teaching terms of external experience. But knowledge is in the meaning, not in the words, and all that happens then is that the esoteric knowledge is lost or distorted. This was why John Tauler, the Germanmystic, had to say about his teacher, Mtister Eckhart, that: 'He spoke from thepoint of view of efernip, mdyo~ rmderstood Aim from tke point of ~iew of tim. ' Time after rime the esoteric Tradition is misunderstood in this way, and so it dies. Then, when the time is ripe, it muss be tither restored or rephrased. In the meantime the meaning is kept alive in communities or schools symbolized by the name 'arka, of which Noah's ark was one. A clear sign that this inner knowledge has been understood in a merely outward way, and that its inner meaning has been forgotten, is the idea that the inner knowledge is \"secret knowledge'. This misunderstanding comes from misreading the term 'inner' or its equivalents. This gives the im- pression that these ideas are the possession of an 'inner group', and will not be given to others. This misunderstanding of the term 'imer' is because the psychological context is not known or is not noticed, so that it is interpreted in an external, purely physical way. At the beginning of this volume cermin effects of this 'exteriorization' of esoteric ideas become very clear as the author writes of the crucifixion, and of the part played by the chosen people in rhs mystery. To understand this correctly, one has to remember the heading to the fist part of this book, which describes it as a study of man. Forgetting this fact, it would be easy to question the purpose of ths passage, or see it as merely a historical comment about things long past so that it were better left unsaid. To understand its value one has to see it as it applies to us now, today, and as it describes things which can happen within and between serious students of these things today. It is not concerned to comment on history but to learn the lessons of this history. And once one is clear about its objective, one can see it as true Gospel commentary, drawing from the sacred text o clear analogy for problems and events now in train and which urgently require study, a living parable for the way that today\" \"chosen people', the modern stu- dents of esoteridsrn, t&ng it in a purely outward way or clinging to the Past, miss the living tradition in defending the dead. For, said Jesus, we must jet th dead bury the dead."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Other chapters in this book should be read in a similar way. They exist to tell us about ourselves, and not for any other reason. In fact, the inner knowledge is freely available to all those who are willing to look into themselves and face the pain this brings. The other factor is that the Tradition is one beyond even the bounds of Christendom, but within Christendom, as the Author makes clear, it takes very different form from that of other versions adapted to other places and times, so that without knowing how to separate local factors from uni- versal elements it is often difficult to make valid comparjsons. EDITOR'S NOTES The ideas in Boris Mouravitffs 'Gnosis' are difficuIt to translate and already, within months of the publication of Volume I, two different ,&ools of thought exist, both of them making valid points. There are thosewh~, correctly filled with respect for the subtIe use of language in the French original, believe that the rranslation should render this original ~iaually word for word. Others say (equally correctly) that the result of this will be unclear not only to the average reader but even to the above- average. Faced with the question of putting this work into print, what are we to do? The answer is te try to piease all the people, but not perhaps all the time. First, we have Iabeured to produce the book in the clearest possible English: not the most modern nor the most literary, as we agree with Clement of Alexandria that sryle is not as important as content, and because we have had to use words in English which possess a precision that many neologisms lack. But this is not enough. We can and do say that those who wish to get closer to the French should study the French. To make this possible we shall endeavour to provide copies of the French to those who wish, and have even acted to encourage a reprinting of the French edition during the present year (1992). We should also comment that in ce~ain cases the French original intentionally incorporates what appear to be grammatical errors, for example rhe use of an improper tense, and it has gradually become clear that these apparent errors actually convey additional infor- mation. In these cases we have endeavoured to follow the same special structure in EngBsh, but at the same time we must apologize because we have almost certainly not identified every complex hint by which this masterly author has conveyed additional information, so that some of them wiII not have come across into the English edition. In the meantime we enclose notes on how certain of these words have been treared in the existing text. We should also mention a slight change in conventions from the First English Edition of Volume I, specifically: Parentdescx A slightly different convention for the use of tmal notes is used in Volume lI from that in the First Edition of Volume I. In this present volume, a note printed in italics within parentheses is the French word which has been translated into the English word immediately to its left. A word or words in roman me within parentheses, on the other hand, is an addition by the editor or translators made ro improve the clarity of the English text but not clearly present or implied in the French.

Voie - Way, Following the publication of Volume I of Gnosis, a correspondence began between the author and the readers, partly direct and partly &rnugh the Centre for Christian Esoteric ~tudies.' From this correspondence emerged a certain number of questions of general interest. In categorizing these questions in groups he endeavoured to answer them in the follawing introduction to the present volume, the second of the series. Geneva, 24th Jme 1962 1.

The present volume deals with the mesoteric qrcle. The third will consider the esoteric cycle in the full sense of this term. In g~tematic teaching of the tradition, each of these cycles has a task andogous to that of one of the three main srages ofpubIic education. Thus: 1. The exoteric cycle corresponds to the ejementay esoteric teaching. As such, it seeks to provide the student with bmic informmation he needs for hs work. It is in a sense the ABC of the Doctrine; 2. The mesoteric cycle, like secondary education, seeks to mrnmu- nicate the dements of a general cuItm-e to the student, and to teach hm a method; 3. The esoteric cycle corresponds to higher or university education. I t should be noted that in dl illspriosrs esoteric teaching, as in ordinary education, elementary education is namrally almost uniform. The sec- ondary teaching of the trahtion, as in its secular equivalent, offers the opportunity of a first speda2ization: classical or modern in the everyday world, monastic or lq in the esoteric field. Higher education is specialized in both cases. I t is generdly accepted that nobody can go on to secondary school without having completed an elementary education, nor begin at uni- versity without having assimilated the content of a secondary education. These graduations automatically select those able to become active mem- bers of the culturd elite of human society. Exactly the same is true in the esoteric sphere, at least in theory. But in practice we often run into a Curious phenomenon. For example we would nor seek to discuss New- ton's binomid theorem without having studied algebra, for without this werg opinion we expressed on the subject would be worthless, yet in the esoteric field we are zoo often inclined to judge without previously learn- ing even the rudiments of this kind of knowledge."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"In the same vein, we oftea demand simplicity from esoteric teaching on the genesally accepted principle that Truth itself must be simple. We conclude from this that access to this Truth should also be simple, and so the method which leads to it must be easily assimilable. This argument is perfectly correct on condition that we ourselves are simple, that is,j~st, in the sense used in the Gospel. Sadly, this is not so, because of the anarchy that reigns among our 987 little I's. There is a long path to travel from our distorted state of inner disorder to our original simplicity. This is the Wajr that leads the seeker from the wiH~mess of ignorance to the Light of Tabor. Experience shows that in practice this doctrine of 'siapficity', if it is regarded as an axiom, turns the student aside from the strait gate and the narrow way that leads to ~ife.' Impelled by this counter-truth, he believes he stands before this door, when he is in reality-although undoubtedly in perfectly good faith-walking on the wide path that leads to perdirion2: a' mqorem Diaboli gloriam, of course. This docfri#e of afnrpIici3, correct in itself but wrongly interpreted, be- comes a snare for our hearts that are already too corrupt; a danger which should be recognized and avoided. W e have already said the first volume of Gnosi~ foms a manual of the elementary esoteric teaching according to the Tradition of Oriental Orthodoxy. That it is in hct no mare thm the ABC of this Knowledgee. Yet it has sometimes been aIleged that Gnosis was a difficult book to read. Although the text does not employ special terminoIogy, this comment is in some sense well founded. The fact is that its subject matter is not simple, and we cannot logically expect to learn a difficult subject without taking pains. Other correspondents have commented on the clarity of the text.3 This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that the book is addressed to a necessarily limited public; to readers who are predisposed to esoteric culture by their nature, formation4 or personal experience. How- ever, the spread of Gfiosis has greatly exceeded expectations. The elite among whom this work has found a response has proved to be quite large. 1. Matthew vii: 13-14; Luke xiii: 24. 2. Matthew di: 13. 3. In fact, hhis demmd for simplidty is typical of the present era, where reachers ue valued according to their television presentation and their ability to explain. The effect of our seeking explanations rhat we ‘immediately clear' is that this hmits our knowledge to hat which can be put in ways that we regard as dear which, in actual fact, limits us to knowledge that lies within the boundaries of what wc already know. To seek immediate clarity is to turn away from knowledge that is dlp new to us. (Ed.) 4, e.g. ThJt 'formative years'. (Ed.) me present Introd#cfion is addressed in partimhr to correspondents who have raised problems of a general nature, more particularly questions concern our Aim and our work. These two points are intimately linked and form two sides of a sifigle question. A very ancient maxim quoted in Saint Luke's GospeI pIaces the problem in its proper context. He writes: 'the labower is tvorth_r of his hirdm5 This rnrnurim is given in the context of sending the seventy disciples 'as lambs among wolvesS6 to announce to the peopIe that 'The kingdom of God is come nigh unto This means that in the esoteric field, as in everyday life, man earns a salary for the service he provides. Nevertheless, exterior life, that of 'A' influences, makes it possible for man to acquire wealth without working; for example by speculation, by all soas of unpnnishable abuses, and by 0th- means that are more or less fraudulent but do not exceed the limits fixed by human law. The General Law leaves a fairly wide margin of toletance to humans working in the domain of 'A' influences. Of them it is said that 'the chi/dfe~ ofthis world iv dheirgefleration me wiser fbm tbe rhildrm ~flighr.' We must not forget that Jesus said this at the conclusion of His well known parable about the unjust On the other hand, in the esoteric field we can gain nothing ?we or true and thus nothing beagtifirl without making efforts whose sum and importance are equivalent to the result to which the worker aspires. Conversely, the vaIue of the results we obtain for ourselves is always equivalent, quantiratively and qualitatively, to the measure of the services rendered on the esoteric level. We emphasize: pwe and tme and thus permanent. It is possible to obtain so-called esoteric results that are impure, but they are false and thus drunfitory. Here we refer to the vast realm of occultism, where the children of this century, more capable than the children of light, seek to apply their abilities beyond the visible world. This occurs in what we call 'mysticism of phenomena'. We shaZI return to this later. S o if the seeker starts with a negative approach and a feeling of infer- iority and dissatisfaction-approaching the esoteric domain driven by the desire to find in is psrsotral and thus impwrs satisfaction for himself, he will not be able to advance very far along this way. If he persists, he will 5. Lukt x: 7; Matthew x: 10. 6. Lukt x: 3. 7. Luh x: 9. 8. Luke xvi: 8. (from the Skvanic text)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"meet with failure. The error of conception made ar the start will imper- ceptibly lead him towards this 'mysticism of phenomena.' In its active form this has already been mentioned in the first volume of this book.' As for the true satisfaction, the reward spoken of in the gospels, the student will find this only by serving an esoteric cause. Theattentive reader wjlI draw a practical conclusion from the above: one must find a genuine esoteric task being carried out in the world, make oneself useful in that work, and cake an active pals in it. That is the meaning of the parable of the rapers, where it is said: 'He that reapeth retsi~tth wages, mdgatherefh fwd unto @fe etcmai: that both he that smetb a#d be that reapeth majr rejoice together.

Orgnnic Jge on Earth, with adamic man at its head, evolves under the zgis of the Absolute II, Christ, the Son of God, who acts among us through those humans capable of being useful, that is, those who are able to take an active part in this work. It is by distinguishing between \"A' and 'BYinfluences that the seeker can make contact with one or more people who are 'reaping\" men, ifhe real& illldersfunds wht t.l t, he can try to play a part in their work. The I ondition -and we have insisted on this many times, but it it once nlurr-is that he can be ~~s~III. In esoteric matters there is IluLrler nlepotism nor exaggerated tolerance. Even less are there charitable institutions. These are attitudes which do not extend outside the zone of 'A' influences. In esotericism even more than elsewhere - and this is understandable-man Is worth what he is worth. He is employed accord- ing to need, and paid for his efforts. If he can already be useful in his ordinary state, he is made to pass through an esoteric apprenticeship. He will then advance according to the measure of his 'talents', in other words his innate predispositions, and by the conscious efforts that he makes. Devotion and faithfulness count for more than anything else. Jesus said: 'No mag, havingp~t his hand to theplo~gfi, and looki~g back, is fjt for the kingdom of GO$ .' \" The kiss of Judas Iscariot, the intellccrual among the Twelve, must remain in the seeker's mind since the components of this mentality are 9. Gll~tis Volume I, pp. 51, 52. 10. John iv: 3638 11, Luke ix: 62. in various degrees to every incomplete Personality. To take an active part in esoteric work -in our epoch even more than two thousand years ago -man must be reliable {sw)l We should be abIe to rely on him whatever happens. Otherwise, under certain circumstances, he risks fol- lowing in Judas' footsteps. He must have no illusion: to betray Jesus is to betray His work, whose object is the salvation of mankind. By betraying Christ's work, above all we betray ourselves. This happens infallibly to seekers who, after crossing the first Thresh- old, approach esoteric work while continuing to deify their Personality. Let us now examine the case of what the Gospel calls raueningwolves. Jesus said: 'Bctvare PffLreprojhets which come foyo~ in sheep's clothing, but inwdrdb thy ore ravening woIvds'. And He adds: 'Ye shall how them b_r their frsn't~.''~ It is difficuft, if not impossible, for an esoterically unevoIved person to discern false prophets spontaneous~y.13 He will recognize them more easily by their 'hits', by the observable results of their works, which serve as s&ns (indices). The Tradition knows and teaches a whole ScPewe of signs. Jesus says: 'It is imjassiblt b~t *bat stmdulf will come: bgt woe mto him thro~gh whom they come! It were bettsr for him fbut a milisfane were hanged abo~t bif neck, and he cast hto the sea ...\"'\" For the time being let us not try to understand the reasons why, as Jesus said, it is impossible that there should not be scandals in the world. We should take this rext as a warning, and never forget that it has a twofold significance, as the Lord concluded: 'fake htd t~~owsehes.\"~ This warning is disturbing. But its value is real. A thief can carry off our wealth, a 'ravening wolf' can deprive us of salvation, That 'ravening wolves' appear in sheep's clothing we shall learn from the following tat, well phrased eo frighten us: 12.

It is important to know this, since the information given is so precise. Jesus says that the end will come when the Gospel wilt be preached throughout the world.'' Today this is an accomplished fact.

We will call it the Time of transition. We ate in the heart of this period, which is relatively short - perhaps a century. It began with the first Hague conference and the Russo-Japanese war - followed by the first Russian revolution and the first world war, which saw the collapse of the old political and social equilibrium of the planet, and paralIel to this the vertiginous progress of technology. Yet it is impossible to measure the exact duration of this time. It is said: 'Bttt of that day and bow bwetb rro man, no, not the angel$ of beavgn, nfifher 4a Son, bat the Father onh.'l9 with this reservation; we can assert that the Time of transition will probably not last beyond the end of ths century. All the signs show that the necessary conditions fox the Ettd are emerging before our very eyes. This time brings with it a great preparatory task for the transition to the approaching third Cycle, that of the Holy Spirit. This task has already been partially accomplished in relation to the outer conditions of orgatpic life on Earth as a whole, particularly those conditions which affec: the materid conditions of human life. In this realm, however, we are obviously approaching a hit in this sense, that the progress of means tends to destroy established ways of 16. Matthew vii: 21-23 (from the SIavonic tact) 17. Matthew xxiv: 14. 18. Matthew xxiv: 24. 19. Matthew xxiv: 36; Mark iii: 32. fife, which neveaheless remain unchanged or, more often, lag behind with , dangerous delay.

A s the material conditions for the new era will soon be fuwled, it is now necessary to establish suitable conditions on the moral plane. But we do not conceive what these conditions might be. Here as elsewhere, the new always remains unhm and so in some way is imon- ctivcdbie. On this plane today, as long ago, man waIks blindfold unless he is enlightened - as in the past - by Revelations transmitted orally by #rm Prophets. Yet as in former hes, the inertia of human thought and man's old- estabgshed habit of giving a fixed scale of vdues the force of a categorical imperative stiIl render the task of the Prophet hard, thankless and dmger- ous. Comfort, he prevailing word for Progres~in its many different aspects and to varying degrees, forms a sufficient aim for the majority of civilized men of our era. Under these conditions of our times, man is only opw to divine values in carefully measured doses, kept wirhin limits so that they do not trouble his bourgeois or socio-communist conscience or threaten the material well-being he has acquired. The danger of such an attitude is that it is ncbf~rai', and so it is supported by an elemental force.

This message also reminded us thzlt the youth of our time needs more attention. It is from their ranks-and those of the fallowing gtnerations- that the torch-bearers who have an innate predisposition for esoteric work will emerge. This is provided that, in addition to a highly advanced pro- fessional training, these predispositions are properly developed by esoteric teaching taken even further than the most advanced professiofial training, These men will then be called on to form the aaive elements of a new elite. Vigilance, added this text, is also necessary to avoid misunderstandmg by those around them, and sometimes even by parents.23 To give esoteric help to these young brothers and sisters is a task as noble as it is delicate. The author calls on his readers to take this essential problem to heart. He added that particular attention was to be paid to young girls as well as young women. Even if the FalJwas provoked by Eve, we must not forget that it was by the Virgin Mary that our Lord came into the world to show humanity the Way to Salvation. And today it is Woman, the daughter of Eve who, because of her refined sensibility, must play the inspirational role in this difficult time of transition leading to the promised era of Redemption. 22.

Matthew x: 36. fix these ideas in our minds better, let us recapitulate what was said arlitr. 1) The final aim that man can hope to achieve by esoteric work is to attain the second Birth and so overcome Death. This aim is expli- citly defined in the Scripmres and has been abundantly commented on in the Tradition and the Doctrine. This is Salvation. 2) With rare exceptions, this aim can ody be attained by the student through hard and methodical work. The sum of the conscious efforts required is proportional to the degeneracy of the Person- ality. It is generally great, much greater than that required for example from the student from the time when he starts hs elemen- tary education until he obtains his doctorate by successfully SUS- raining a thesis. 3) The particular character of these efforts -as we have seen in the first volume and will perceive even more clearly here - is that all the work done by the student on himself must be characterized by (W t: placed wder the rign on waking the emotional functions that are generally deeply asleep, especially in cultured people of our time. This awakening, this flame, is the express condition and the point of departure leading to success: to advance, one mmf bun. A fire that smoulders under the ashes is not enough. A special method is provided to allow students to rekindle an inadequate fire and to fan it when it is fading. 4) This work on oneself, although its aim is the evolution of the individual, cannot be accompEshed in a vacuum, thar is, in isola- tion, The law is clear: the desired result cannot be gained in practice except in the form of wages according to the stated principle that: 'the Iaba~rer is wurtly of bis hire.' Another way of saying this is thar the accumulation of esoteric values cannot be realized by ways used in the everyday world; by egoistical means. All tr~e esoteric work is oriented in a direction diametrically op- posite to egoism. 5) Thus the student must not let himsdf be deluded by the mirages which await him on the track (fintier), but must arm himself with a strong faith and a firm courage which will allow him to find a practical means of entering some Esoteric work which is being carried out in the world."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"6) For this, desire in the loins andfirs in the heart are not yet enough, If it remains without any specificpr~~ttit~l esoteric application, the force of this tension that has been kindled will dissipate in smoke. Every force demands a definite point of application, and without this it: will decompose and disperse. Before this force can be applied, the student who seeks esoteric work must aIso be ~efd. His task begins with this, that is, when he rnavts on from words and aspirations to actions. To the degree that hecompletes this work, his 'salary' will automatically increase. 7) The seeker is frree to E~OOS~. The discipline is accepted voTuntariIy, but it is of iron. The student can abandon the work at any moment to return to worldly interests. However, he will remain 'intoxicated', since participation in esoteric work will progressively open his eyes, make the colours of exterior life fade for him, and shake his old scale of values. The freedom of choice and the initiative demanded of the seeker bring n danger: that of taking the false for the true; the impure for the pure, allowing himself to become subject to the sandal of 'powers' etc. When such mistakes are committed by a pure md ardent hart as the result of a sincere error, they do not in themselves hold mortal danger. He will be warned in time even if he persists in his error. The case of Saint Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus gives us a convincing example. The red danger, which can lead to mortalsin, to a definite check, occurs when an impure heart seeks to be served by higher forces for its awn egoistic ends. This is a quagmire. +This last point requires comment. A curious phenomenon often occurs in the human mind when it con- siders the generally hermetized theories and facts of the esoteric realm, We have already mentioned this, but it is worrhwhkle to return to ie once again from a slightly different viewpoint because the question is so important. In positive science, pure, moral or applied, it is generally accepted that we must be well versed in a subject before we can give a valid opinion. To speak seriously, one must speak of what one how$, which presupposes previous studies. It is entirely different in the esoteric domain, Here we believe ourselves competent without even completing an elementary education. Wejudge before we have developed in ourselves the correct instrument with which 24. In the occult sense (Ed.). to judge. Yet we know that like can only be conceived, understood and judged by something similar or higher. Without this, all judgements, discussions and adpice about esoeric facts remain comparable to evalua- tions and opinions about the shade of a cdour by someone born blind. Just as the world we live in is closed off, invisible to the fetus in its womb until the awakening of its birth, even so the higher planes of Life, the astral and spirit&, are simiIarly closed and invisibb to us until the second Birth. Until then, man can only form hypotheses or refer to the testimony of authors who have themselves been twice born. As for passing validplldgeemdnf~of these facts, authors, and people, he wjIl not be able to do this until he has himself crossed the second Threshold. Then, having become spiritual in the meaning given by Saint Paul - and only then - 'm ., .j#dgees 011, and bimstv isj~dgtd bJy t~obo&'\" Then the Apostle in explanation says: we hme tbf .mind (inftll&ence, Gr.: no4 of ~hri~t.\"~ In effect, by identifying with his teal 'I', the monad of Christ, she Indit~id~aIity enrers a direct relation with His intelligence, just as Saint Paul said. T hat seems quite clear, Nevertheless, the curious phenomenon already mentioned is commonplace these days, and even people of perfectly good faith - not to mention others --persist in their attitude. This phenomenon is due to m-o principle causes. One is the general tendency of humans to claim qualities which in the exterior man exist only in potential; and the other, a consequence of this, is the subconscious deification of the Personality, regarded as if it were omnipotent in every realm. Humility is necessary for trm esoteric work, but its lack is further ag- gravated in many people who possess, at least in theory, the possibility of penetrating into the supersensory realm. We are not speaking here of people of bad faith; this subject has been amply treated in the first volume ofthis We shall only examine the case of sincere people who stray - beca~se this is ofit~derest to tohe Work.

(It looks) for manife~dati~#'~ that confirm that its work is well founded, or which simply satisfy its curiosity. This is where the above-mentioned scandals and the greatest dangers lie. For it is often possible to obtain the desired 'facts' quite easily from the domain of SI, ro which the human Personality also belongs. When it is solidly anchored in the physical body it is generally incapable of making direct connection with this level. However certain persons, known as sms6a*ives, have the innate or acquired faculty af mo- mentarily weakening the ties of the Personality to the physical body so that, with no esoteric evolution whatever, they are able to connect with this level - with the coarsest layers of SI. \"Facts\" obtained in this way are often regarded by people who seek them as coming from the spiritual led, or at least from the fine layers of level $ which express the will of the Absolute II, because this is in direct contact with Him and is &led by His Love. The realm of $ is that of Individua- lities, Saints and entities of that order, charged with missions on different levels. By contrast, the realm of level SI is a vast reservoir of psychic (psychique) entities that have no contact with the higher plane, including amongst them disincarnate Personalities, who normally remain there to await their second ~eath~'--the negative equivalent ofthe second ~irth.~~ This usually occurs on the fortieth day after death of the physical body. Orthodox Tradtion expressly warns seekers against contacts with this realm whch is so dangerous and full of the worst illusions. In monastic esoteric practice, special prayers are said to ward off influences of this kind, particularly those visions that so often result from researches into certain teachings, even if well intentioned. These prayers art meant ro avoid a fall hto a mystical trap which manifests in the following way. Tt often happens that entities belonging to the SI domain seek contact with humans - more particularly with those who wish to establish a contact with the beyond. The aim of these entities is to interfere in ter- restrial life; to draw on vitality and so gratify unsatisfied desires that they have carried beyond their physical life.34 32. Revelation xx: 6. 33. John iii: 8. 34. Cf. I Corinthians vii: 28."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"'She power of intervention of these entities is a function of the credulity they meet. The Orthodox Tradition classifies them in the category of little devils or imps (diabloti~s). The yearning to experience 'miraclcs'~ 'visions' etc., creates an atmosphere favourable for their appearance, which can assnme various forms, sometimes perceptible to the senses. 'Ib give them- selves importance, these apparitions take the names of jllustriaus men as well as those of Saints and Archangels; they even go so far as to borrow the names and wen the appearance of the Virgin Mary or of Christ Himself. The Philokalia and the Doctrine contain many descriptions of this kind of me. Through the Science of Signs (indices), the Tradition teaches a method which allows US to discern this category of psychic phenomena that are too often taken for facts that genuinely come from higher levels. For this purpose it is appropriate to stress that in the materialist ehenomenali~t) mind of the cultured man of our era, the true and the false in esoreric research easily become mixed together. This confusion is gen- erally increased by the environment in which man is placed, the Mixtus Orbis. This entanglement shows above all in the domain of our affections, which are generally unbalanced in us because the habit oflying has become our true second nature. The innate faculty of immediate discernment of the true from the false is thus lost, and man, even the most cultured and learned, becomes singularly credulous, particularly in the 'mystical' realm. This imbalance affects us according to a law: creddi~ is inverse& proportionul to faith. In other words, the weaker is our true faith and thus our pure emotions, the mare our credulity grows, often taking grotesque forms. In this mechanism we can perceive the familiar action of the General Law: to inspire the man who seeks the Wq with the idea that he is alr~ad9 on the wq. This is the best and the most common means used by the Devil to turn away the seeker who has had insufficient warning'frorn the narrow way which leads to Life. Jesus, the Master of the esoteric Tradition, said: 'How tmye belie~e which reteivegloy from one another, and ~etk not theglory tbaf comsth ymm God ~n(y?'~' When we accept the 'glory of men' yet still believe that we arc on or walking on the Way, we fall directly under the law of Equilibrium, Jesus alluded to this when he quoted the Pharisees who prayed in the streets, saying that 'fly hue aIremj r8ceived thir reward,\"' 35.

The elements of bawledge (swoir) found there form, in effect, the tools with which man can work on himself. Our studies will continue in the same framework: Ma#, the Uniuerse, and the Wq, and will have the same ah: to help the persevering seeker con- tinue his evolution unril he finally reaches the point where he can over- come Death. But while our studies in the first volume centred on man as an isolated entity, we will now consider him in the larger context of organic life on Each, whose evolution ensures the development of our Ray of Creatiott. This method will allow us to organize our srudies jn the framework of a natural scientific order in which the s,yIIabirs corresponds to the stmcttlre of the object &died. L et us naw examine and try to understand the general meaning of the evolution of organic life, considering it in its ensemble as an organ of our planet. At the same time we wi6 try to determine man's place in this organ, and the mission with which he has been charged. Organir l$ on Earth was conceived and has appeared in particular cosmic conditions, Modern science gives us a general view of its growth and development. We will remember that the notes LA, SOL, FA of the lateral octave correspond to rhe ~vhole of argonic Lye, and that each of them represents one of the three elements: man; fauna; and flora. Together they form a transt~~iffer station for cosmic energies filling the interval between FA and MI of the Great Octave and so playing a parr in the normal development of our Ray of Cnlatotr. T he reader has grasped the importance of distinguishing between the notions of growth and developlnent. The moment has come to give a pecise definition to these two terms."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"In the most general sense, the process of creation follows a descending gamut: in it we must distinguish three consecutive stages: - All creation is conceived in the note DO. It receives its first impulse from the will and power of the Creator, which fills the inten~nl between DO and SI: thus It is born. - The process of growth begins at this moment. It normally passes through four consecutive stages following the notes SX, LA, SOL and FA. Growth ends in the note FA. - Creation then faces the following alternative: either it must develop through the notes MI and RE, or it will degenerate. Its fate there- fore depends on the possibility of filling the second intend be- tween FA and MI. Once this interval is passed, development Om continues through two further stages in the notes MI and RE. The success of this work appears in the note DO of the following L octave. The notions of growth and development are often confused. Atthough QL they are distinguished in some disciplines of biology, for example, the 1?1* dividing line is not always clearly defined. What was just mentioned will IF allow the reader to rethink the examples given in the first volume, bcgin- ru ning from Creation down to the general diagram of The Wq. In this Iast case he will better grasp the difference in nature which exists berween the two parts of The Wg: the Staircase, which corresponds to the notion of grewth, and the Way proper, which symbolizes development. We must still describe in general terms the nature and significance of the force that fills the interval between notes FA and MI. We have seen that this force is born from a lateraloctave which arises from the note SOL of the first octave, and that the joint effort of the threenotes LA, SOL and FA tiUs the interval. If we return to the definition given above, we can now say thargpmvfb of the lateral octave makes possible the development of creation accordmg so the Jrinc$al Octave. This law applies to every form of Creation, from the Great cormic Octme to the most rudimentary beginnings of human activity. Properly understood, it includes the neophyte's journey from thejr~t Threshold to the end of the Wq. W e will now return to organic lye on Earth. It is through t>e growth of this organ that the development of our Rajl of Creation, an element of the Great cosmic Octa~e, can and must be completed. But what stage has the I growth of organic lye on Eartb reached today, and what prospects does it offer for the development of our Ray of Cre1ztiod me body of information provided by natuid history and anthropology allows us so follow the evolution of the growth of orgmic ife from very early then. If we do not know haw it began, we can at least represent to ourselves the stages in the growth of the different components of organic /iff, As with all growth, this has two aspects: qualitative and quantitative. We have seen that the life-giving (vivifjan) effect ofthe energy from the ~bsolute I is the result of the flow and counterflow of waves diffused along The Rg of creation.%= same phenomenon occurs all aIong the lateral ottaue: the growth of orgatlie ife is realized in gradual stages and as the energy from the Absolute II provokes a response. In the same way, the potential energy accumulated in a seed takes hnetic form as growth when the seed is sown and provokes a reaction from the soil. As in all descending octaves, the energy from the Absolute IT takes on a masculine character; it penetrates within {dam le mil4, where the action occurs as in a kind of womb (matrice); and it is to the degree that the reaction of the latter spreads upward along the laterdl octave that organic /ye makes its appearance. This is always the manifestation af the same Lraw of Realixation - to which allusion is made in the formula of Revelation: \"ebold, I stafid at the door and hock: gay matt hear mj ~oice andopen the door, I will come into Aim, and will sup with him, and bs with me,'\" The Love from the Absolute 11, a vivifying masculine energy, is pro- jected in superabundance downward along the lateral oftfaye. But the con- crete result of this, the birth of orga.qic lye, appears only as a response to this call, a kind of reflux of feminine energy. Progressing upwards to the interval, this energy re-establishes the primal equilibrium - which had been broken in the heart of the void by the perturbing action of Love from the Absolute II - through a living realization. The feminine energy first reaches the note FA, then rises towards SOL, and finally reaches LA.^ In other words, orgmic ffe on Earth appears in the opposite direction to the action of Love; at first in the form of flora; then as fauna, and lastly as man, though this may at first seem paradoxical. Within each of these notes we can see the same complex process of growth and development. In each of the three cases this process foIlows a descending inner gamut. It is triggered by the reflux impulse, which then serves as the active force that ensures the general growth of organic lqe. To move on to deveIopment, a complementary voIuntary effort is required, In 1. Cf. Vol I, figure 47, p. 135. 2. Revelation iii: 20. 3. We shd not stop for the moment at the question of how thc interval between FA and MI of the ~tm~lOttaytis filled, which is an~logous to theway by which the same interval of the Great OCI~~ is filled, We shall return to this question in the second part of this volume."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"the gamut of vegetable fife this manifests as agricuPturd work. It is this conscious, voluntary effort of the cultivator which fills the intemal be- tween FA and MI of this so that the Earth multiplies its fruits. If this effort were to cease, the farmhnds and orchards would remm to the primitive state and the rose again become the wild egIantine. Exactly the same is true for animaIs and for man himseIf, as we shall see further on. The process of development, as we have defined it, represents the rejnemnt of organic lye on Earth: through this the frm~mitter sfafion re- sponds with increased sensitivity to the impact of the energy from the Absolute I directed towards it by the Absolute II. During the process of development, the station also acts as a transformer that emits 5ner and then std finer waves. This is the qualitative aspect. From the quantitative point of view, the multiplication of the elements of orga~ic life renders our planet's transmitter station more and more powerful and at the same time more and more sensitive. Thus, step by step, the necessary conditions to fii1 the interval between FA and MI of the Great Octave are progressively assembled (remi). By the note MI, the flow along our Ray of Crtation would be capable of transforming life on our planet, and consequently the life of the planet itself; it wouId then produce transformations in our satellite that would take it on to the next stage of its evolution. an's ingenious and conscious intervention stimulates the develop- M ment of fauna and ~ora in a certain direction at a certain pace, and so gives them certain qualities. But how does the development OF man himself occur? By what influence -necessarily exterior - is the interval between FA and MI ofhumanity's gamut of evol~tion Hled so that it allows man to go beyond the growth stage and reach the stage of development? By the human measure of Time, the complete process (en~emble) of hu- man growth and development seems particularly long. Yet since growth takes up four notes of the gamut, and development only two, the latter is much shorter than the former. This difference is further accentuated by the fact that any creative process, if it evolves normally, always goes on accel- erating. Although the growth of the human species has lasted from the tertiary epoch, sixty or perhaps a hundred million years,5 the contemgor- ary physical human type, barno sapien~ fossilis, still a primitive qpe, appeared only forty thousand years ago in the later paleolithic era, and man with the 4. The causes and effects that manifest the suurssion of gamuts that form the ladder of the cosmos occur in cycles. The three grtat motivating powers (taptars) of man; hunger, sex and fear, oblige him to take the initiative and to play a part in constructive or productive work. 5. Cf. Volume 1, chapter VIII, section 6, pp. 71-72. modern type of psyche, exterior man: homo sapien~ recmr, goes back ap- proximately fourteen thousand years.7 Were we to represent the whole (ensfmbie) of man's growth and devel- opment graphically, with time as the x-axis, we should attribute to growth two thousand times the duration of development. The rise of this curve along the y axis, insignificant during growth, becomes very fast during development, as shown by figure 2, p. 48. This view corresponds integrally to the biblical account of Genesis, in which the creation of man took place in two distinct stages. In the first or pie-adamic humanity a both men and women were created in the image and likeness of the creator;' then comes the creation of Adam followed by that of Eve, bone of his bone andjresh lif hisfresb.'\" It is since Adam that man has received the capacity to pass from growth to development in his evolution, and only part of the humanity of those times received this gift. The Bible speaks of a long period of coexistence of the first humanity alongside adamic humanity. It later refers to the latter as passing through a period of recession following mixed marriagesn wwhich were considered by God as evidence ~f~reatpew~rsi~~'~ and which led this mixed humanity to the catastrophe of the Flood. It is to be noted that the first hmanity, having by that time reached the limit of its growth, still retained animal characteristics: it did not possess speech. Genesis alluded to ths by indicating that it was to Adam and not to ere-adamic man that God brought the species of fauna to be narned.l3 The account went on: andAdamgme names to all the beasts, to the birds ofthe air, and to euey mimd of the field l4 Adam became a living ~oul'' (he vivant) after a conrplemcntqy impdse given to him by God. The Bible's symbolic language expresses this by the following image: 'the Lard God formed mm of the d~st of the ground a J breathed into his nosfriIs the breath of I$; and rnan became a living SOM~.''~ This is the esoteric meaning of this metaphor: man, formed from the dust of the ground, appeared very like his counterpart of the animal world: he would have reminded us of the anthropoids as we know them at present, 6.

In addition he possessed in latent state a potential that the purely animal world does not possess, that of passing on to human and even mperbdlnrc~n stages of devel- opment. But this development was only possible if man had received this comp/ementury imptlIse which would allow him to pass, in the individual gamut, from the note FA where the most evolved of this humanity had arrived to the note MI, which represents the first stage of development. In the sacred text, the image of God breathing the breath of life into Adam's nostrils -which gave the latter a living Soul -represents this new im- pulse. We should aIso note that the creation of this second humanity, adamic humanity, is a response to the divine will to use man for the transformation of the flora and the cultivation of the soil {~t).'~ The Breath of life is an image of the implantation in adamic man of a divine spark taking the form of two coupled higher centres. Until then m, formed from the dust of the ground, had only two lower centres, the motor and emotional centres that had been formed wirh the phpsid body by the creative energy of the sexual centre; from this time on :le also had a higher emotional centre and a higher intellectual centre. But he still lacked the lower intellectuaI centre, of whlch he had a most urgent need far the transformation of matter, and particularly to cuItivate the soil. This was the state of the psyche of Adam and Eve before the fall, in the terrestrial Paradise of the Garden of Eden. They live constant1y in direct contact with God, since the purity of their lower emotional centre allowed them to maintain permanent contact with the higher emotionzl centre and through this with the higher intellectual centre. In this way they could mrticipate, dthough only passively, in life on a higher, divine plane. It is at this time that man hlly broke away from the purely animal life. Ia the vertical position his hands were feed for many different tasks. And it was by work that adamic man began on his long path of progress. Until then, he was only a consumer; from then on he beme a producer. Adam was wise, with a divine wisdom which penetrated through hs higher centres and through the lower emotionalcentre, whch still retained its original purity. This state of innocent simplicity was of n higher quality, although unconscious in the sense that Adam drew upon the highest planes in a passive way. It is described in Genesis ja a way which may seem odd at first glance. The text says: 'thy were 60th naked, #he mu# a~d his wife, ad were not afbrfmcd.\" Creative work, primitive as it was then, faced adamic man with the need to formulate aims and determine the best means for attaining them. It was under this pressure that the need for judgement arose, in other words, the 17. Gcnwis vi: 2 18. Gentsis ii: 5. 19. Gencsis il: 25. mind (/'esprit crifique). The state of uneonsuous beatitude of life in Eden corresponds to the passage ofAdam and Eve from the interval of FA to the MI of their evolutionary octave. But the further the couple advanced the moat filled by the divine grace breathed into them, the more dearly the notion of economy of effort, which accompanies productive work, was presented to their minds. Then appeared the idea of advantage, then that of gain, which first attacked Eve's heart, penetrating and wound- ing her. This is the mark of the Serpent who, says the Bible, tuarmre mbtle than an_r beast of thf fie1d2' This increasingly intimate perception of the material world was trans- lated in man by the formation of the lower intellectual centre, whch Genesis calls the Trfe of Kflowkdge of Good and BV~J.~' This completed the formation of the human personality as we know it. Meanwhile, with the birth of the critical mind which accompanied the notion and desire for acquisition, the original purity of thelower emotional centre in the hearts of Adam and Eve was disturbed. As Jesus says later: for where yo#r treatwe is, thm wi/l_yew beart be almZ2 Pursuing the mirage of temporal goods, Adam and Eve's lower emotional centre hardened.

As a result of the conscious intervention of these two forces, Mother Earth engendered man from the d~sf ofthe E&.\" This is simply a specific example of the creative action of the comple- mentary forces in the Universe, where all the suns together form the body of the cosmic Christ, the Absolute TI, and all the satellites form the body of the Mother, the Queen of Heaven, Regifla Aspis. We should again point out that this description will allow the reader to rethink certain passages of the first volume about the structure of the Universe. It was with this reffux of feminine energy in response to the divine masculine energy that the growth of the creature began. At the start, the sexud centre and the motor centre emerged simultaneously; then came the creation of the lower emotional centre. Once a mental (psy~hiq~e) body had been formed in this way, the process of growth could continue and reach completion. But this was not yet adamic man, sepa- rated from the heaven which was previously accessible to him and tied to the earth yet having left his animal nature behind. The divine spark, which takes she form of linked higher centres, represents the link with Heaven in man, while the lower intellectual centre binds him to the earth at the same time as it separates him from the animaI. It is as if adamic man is suspended between Earth and Heaven. He has the capacity for regaining Paradise through conscious efforts, by buiIding a bridge to the divine spark which he carries within him. But he is generally unaware of this. T he joint action of rhe ermtive energy of the sexual centre and the faculties of intuition and discernment of the lower intellmtual centre caused imagination to arise in man. After this, his development, the fruit of hs conscious efforts, takes on a so to say epicyclic form: 3) Man expbrex the unknown: this operation, fruit of ths creative imagination, is characteristic of every project; 2) Then, by the retwnpath his ideas become concrete, he accumulates the necessary data to establish a plan of action and assembles the elements needed to put it into execution; 3) Lastly, thus enriched, he acts on this plan. This is the scheme of every human enterprise which puts into play all the factors in this activity. 27. Genesis ii: 7. an's acquisition of the higher centres'8 led to the formation of the M lower intellectual centre in him, and its appearance completed the '1' the Personality: in its turn, this completion allows a man who follows the gamut of his evolution to cross the interval. between FA and MI of that and so reach the note MI, where his development begins. In all the descending gamuts of creation, particularly in those which have a positive nature, the note MI has analogous characteristics. It cor- responds to the Earth in the Grrat cosmic Octme. We may also remember that theesoteric meaning of this syllable (MI) is: Mixt~~orbis, mixed world. In the octave of human evolution, when growth has been completed and the interval crossed, man's inner life takes on this same character of a Mixtdfs orbis. ?his means that he then ceases to be oriented in only one direction as is an animal or plant that lacks the capacity for individual development. Animal md vegetable evolution ends when it bears fruit. Animals, and even more certainly plants, do not and cannot have inner conflicts: they only have one goal, the preservation of life with the aim of procreation, and all their efforts are centred on this goal. Man, on the contrary, lives in a kingdom of doubts and imer conflicts which some- times truly tear him apart, It is rare that the escape to the shelter of bourgeois life, with its mediocre passions, its voluntarily limited interests, and its slow pace, can guarantee freedom from shocks all through life. There comes a day when the scaf- folding of tricks towards God and oneself falls into ruin: the hurricane of an unexpected passion sweeps it away, and nothing remains but a poor overwhelmed being faced with the insoluble or apparently insoluble pro- blem of building a new life. Man has a double aim in his personal evolution: susvjval and procreation on the one hand, a continuation of his animal life, and on the other hand his esoteric development which will allow him to achieve IttdividftaJi~, by awakening to consciousness of his real 'I' at the second Birth -possibly in this life. Naturally the second aim is much more imporrant than the first; their value is incommensurable. But exterior man does not know this. He per- ishes for bronze, mistaking it for gold.

After the coming of Christ, when traditions until then her- metic were partially released from secrecy, some of them were incorpo- rated in the doctrines of schools which were attempting to synthesize a Greco-Judaeo-Christian gnosis. A powerful movement of thought was launched by Simon Magus, a Samaritan whose personality remains shrouded in legend. A few fragments of the doctrine he elaborated with Mtnander's help were passed down to us by Satornil, a disciple of the latter. After an absurd and complicated account of the events which pre- ceded Creation, he relates that rhe first man crawled. He said that later the Virtue from abave had pity on him because he was created in His image; that He gave him a spark of Life which allowed him to stand upright and enabled him to live. This spark of Life - so Satornil taught - reascends after death towards the higher beings to whom it is relasedmZ9 This fragment, which on the whole agrees with canonical Tradition, was placed in a most fanciful framework. The error of the heretical gnostics, as we know them from criticisms by the Fathers of the Church, their adversaries-among whom we can quote Saint Irenacus and Saint Clem- ent of Alexandria- took the form of intellectually detaching man from the Cosmos in which he lived. The probIem was thus reduced to the personal fate of the individual. On the other hand the imperfection of the phenom- enal world was naively explained either by a celestial catasmphe or as an error of God of as a result of His wickedness. This error of conception has already been described in the first volume of Gnosis. We recognize here the influence of Hellenistic thought which, after the time of Homer, attributed human motives to the Gods. Neither was this tendency foreign to the Jewish mind, which went as far as making God repent of having created an:' and attributed fea4' and vengeanceJ2 to him. The more important the question studied, the more it should be con- sidered in all its aspects; otherwise synthesis, the only thing that can resolve ir, becomes impossible since the value of elements analysed in isolation is always debatable - because they have then been arbitrarily detached from other elements which must be considered to obtain a com- plete picture.

By specifying the nature of the bonds that join them, we shall be better able to perceive the full extent of man's mission on the planet and in the Cosmos. Before life was born on Earth, it was first necessary to realize the con- htions for this birth. Note SI of the lateral octave represents this prelimin- ary stage, in which Earth was first enveloped by an atmosphere and a magnetic field, the one inseparable from the other. Before the atmosphere came to have the complex stsuaure it has today, it evolved through a descending gamut which, following the rule, included a period of growrh and a period of development, But from its first appearance it vivified the planet which, from that time an, became a sensitive organ active in the body of the Mesocosmos and, through the latter, from level to level through the whoIe Macrocosmos. The appearance of cellular life feuowed the birth of the atmosphere and Earth's magnetic field. Since this appearance, and long before the atmo- sphere had reached the complex forms reported by modern science, cel- lular life allowed the tranrmitter station to function, its role being to fill the interval between FA and MI of the Great Octave of the Rq of Creation by transforming the energies that emanate from the Absolute II. That it was necessary for it to be Elled in contact with the planet is shown by its position in the Great Octave. This position also reflects one aspect of the character of the Mixt#.r Orbis- Earth-which although it is shown at the level of MIin the Octave, is also an element of the planetary cohort and participates in FA through the links it has with the latter. O~ganic lye is therefore properly placed at the level of the interval between those two notes. Today, positive science codrms the traditional concept in which the atmosphere of a planet is the result of a concentration of the ETHER under the influence of subtle energies. This is a symbolic way of saying that diffused interstellar matter can condense around a planet once solar action has allowed the formation of nmagneric field, as this tends to collect matter passing through space. The Tradition recognizes the interaction between rhe atmosphere, the magnetic field, and solar radiation. Once it has been formed the atmosphere resists sobr radiation, and this resistance rein-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"forces the Euth's magnetic field. Amongst other functions, this collecrs cemin influences hrected by the sun towards our planet for the benht of organic lye, and particularly for man, its most sensitive organism. Reception is uniformly distributed by Earth's daily rotation. To this direct reception is added indirect reception through reflection by the Moon, the intensity and quality of which varies according to its phases. Graphically, its in- tensity can be shown by a sine curve. The twin roles of the atmosphere and the earth's magnetism, which condition life on Earth and Hl the interval between FA and MI of the Great Octave, form one particuIar instance of the means by which the second interval of the Rqs of Creation, the interval DO-SI, is filled for the whole Macrot~mos: in this way, life can develop without discontinuity through all the levels of a Universe, so that its functioning manifests an organic unity. If certain astronomical representations of the Universe in positive science have sometimes seemed to contradict the theory of this fundamen- tal unity, the most recent information, especially that concerning cosmic rays and exchanges of energy,' seems to show progress toward the con- firmation of traditional Knowledge. n fl ora, fauna and man, the principal common feature by which the unity 1 of life is expressed is respiration, the essential characteristic of all living beings.' Immersed in the atmosphere, which penetrates even into the soil, the rivers and the oceans, everything that lives breath. Respiration has functions in addition to the chemical transformation in which oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged. It allows living matter to draw from radiation -as it is when it reaches the level of organic Iye after passing through the atmosphere - certain dements or certain influences coming from our solar system and from beyond, from the galactic world. According to the Tradition, each of these elements bears the quahtative mark of the source from which it originated. Depending on its state of beitrg, every living body can absorb and assimilate all hnds of material influences originating anywhere in the Universe. When several persons are gathered in a particular place, for example, the same air is inhaled (by all). Yet everyone exhales a different air. This is because of the unequal power of absorption of the people present, a power which is a function of their respective levels of b~ing on the physical Ievel, the level of the psyche, and 1.

This shows in the working of the three gamuts of nutrition of which we shall speak further in chapter XI. L et us now examine the relationship between org~snic lfc on Earth and the Sun. The Tradition has always considered the Sun as the Absolute for this life; that is ro say, as the Being who conditions it entirely. It refuses to consider it as no more than a laboratory where chemical reactions and physical, magnetic of electrical phenomena take place at a temperature of several million degrees yet are ultimately reducible simply to mechanical combinations. Apart from its action in the physical domain, it is generally recognized today that the Sun exercises an important influence on man's psychology. This action can be observed particularly following the appearance of sun- spots, as, apart from the magnetic storms they provoke, these frequently bring on social disorders and even wars. Until recent times, positive science has only been able to observe the Sun through the Trifocosmos and Mesocoxmos. It is only in the very last few years, since probes have aIlowed us to photograph the Sun free of the filtering d radiations by the atmosphere, that we have become aware of the impor- tance of the deformations that are due to this screen: the appearance of the sun, especially its colour, changes as soon as we reach the stratosphere. But the possibility of launching satellites equipped with scientific instruments should allow us to collect new information about the outer aspect of our Absolute under conditions if not identical to, at least similar to those under which we have collected scientific data relative to the Earth: to observe the Sun as it appears from within its own cosmos, and no longer through two successive screens. T hough of a Merent nature, the relations whch link the Earth to the Moon, and the influence these two cosmoses exerr over each orher, are of considerable importance for orgmie 1Je on our planet. The Moon is RE at one and the same time both for our iaferdoctme and for bAe Great Oetme. It is a mem bcr of the Tessarocosm since it is a planetary satellite and a particle of the body of the Cosmic Mother. It represents the feminine cosmic energy in our Ray cfCreation, and, like Isis and Aphrodite- Urania, it personifies Love in its passive, feminine or reflected form. It is the last note of the gamut descendmg from the Sun, which is the DO of our l&rd octave, a star of the Mac~omsmos, and thus a particle of she cosmic"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Christ. The Sun personifies the Absolute II for our Rq of Creafiorp, while the lunar energy propagates by asciending along both the Great Octave and larerd octave at the same time: it is described in the former as the Mother of God and in the lateral octave as theQ~een of Heme#, Regina Rrtris: the liturgy attributes these titles to the Virgin Mary. The Moon is therefore the receptacle, the matrix which, in response to the energy of the Absolute II, gives birth aIl along the Ray of Creation, to the different elements of cosmic life, the beings belonging to the three kingdoms of orgmic /if#, so that the latter falls under zhe influence of the Sun-Moon poIarization. The Moon's passive energy arises from solar energy. It reflects this, but not without a transformation as its own nature interferes to polarize the reflected rays relative to their initial character. The as yet untinished nature of the T~ss~ocosmos has already been men- tioned in the first volume of Gtfosis, with the consequences to which this incompleteness leads for arg& lye, and particularly for man. The Moon, regarded as a living cosmic being, is not yet born. This is betiaped parti- cularly by the absence of an atmosphere and magnetic field. Unlike the Earth, the Moon does not have a direct organic link with the Sun. Being a satellite, it depends directIy on its planet, and it is only through the latter's mediation that it enters into relation with the Sun. One of its essential roles is to reflect solar energy onto the Earth's surface in a form modified by reflection as described above. This also leads to qualitative and quantita- tive variations that depend on its phases. These changes do not prevent continual reverberation, due to the fact that the Moon always presents the same face to Earth, as the duration of its rotation around ifself md around our planet ate both the same. T he Rag( of Creation to which the human species belongs therefore remains uncompleted. Neither organic lqe, nor man in particular, have reached the point in their growth and developmect which would perfectly fdl the interval between FA and MI of the Great Octave- with the two consequences which would then occur: the vivification of the Earth at stage MI, and the animation of the Moon at note RE by the energy that comes from the AbsoIuteI. We must clearly perceive in this final operation the combinedplay of the octaves at: the level of the interval, the flux, union, dux and, in the creative process, the synergy between the forces arising from the Protocosm and the De#feroco~ms. According to St John, to the degree that this crossing is accomplished, Earth receives pee ~$on~rat~,~ since the energy appearing within it will then come simultaneously from 3. John 1: 16. 18 both the Great Octave and the laterdl ocfavs, that is to say, bath from the Absolute I and the Absolute II. In addition, the Moon profits from energy coming from the ensemble of orga~ic Jfe on Earth. Here, man appears to have a prominent tole. T he voluntary, conscious nature of human actions in the transforma- tion of organic lfe has dready been noted, This intervention becomes more and more noticeable, and more and more widespread. Were we to represent its results by a graph this would approximate that of a geometric The pace of production continues to accelerate. IEwe cannot go so far as to state that this coincides absolutely with the growth of the population considered sector by sector, we can consrate that, seen as a whole, it varies in similar proportions. One could regard this as a response to the apparent compression of Time of which we have spoken elsewhere. From the qualitative point of view we must stress how important is man's selective role in these operations of the transformation and elimination of fauna and flora: this selection conditions not only the growth but, above dl, the development, that is to say, the refinement of organic life. It would be useful to examine in a little more detail the history of these transformations of organic I$ so as to understand better how they are linked to the completion of our Rq oj Creation. When orgatric lye first appeared on our planet, only the note FA of the LteralOctave was resonating. The transmission of energy was then carried out only by the flora, in a way that was coarse and incomplete. The entry into play of the note SOL changed this situation very little. The existence of giant specimens of fauna and then the emergence of pit-adamic man certainly influeneed the volume of activity of the transmitter station, but stiU lacked the qualitative element which alone could cause the note LA to resonate: that is to say, man's reaching the stage of development, a stage required as catalyst in the expansion of the two other notes. It was the actions of man that led to the appearance of plants of high nutritive value, to the domestication of certain species of animals, and to the application of selective methods to livestock. These were the first steps towards the I I domestication of Narure, which sometimes appears in the form of an amplification of the pIay of natural phenomena and sometimes restricts their action. In essence ths domestication tends to create potential useful- ness to man. The immediate effect is an increase in the flora and fauna that Serve man. The ability to use more and more extensive sources of energy has direct repercussions on the opposed cycles of general nutrition, repercussions 19"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"which tend to produce what we can all constste nawadays: the geometric devefopment of those elements which provide the fran~mitter itarion with its power. I f growth and development are visible and regular as far as fauna and flora ate concerned, we can also say that during the historied period the quality of exterior man has not undergone modification except in an un- balanced form: the intellectua2 hypertrophy of the governing classes has occurred at the expense of their emotional functions and, in certain cases, of their motor functions. This is because man works harder and harder to better the conhtions of life without caring about life itself. Certainly this last conmm seems to have remained conscious wihn certain circles in the Orient - and ths doubtless explains the attraction they exercise - but what has become in the West of the active tendencies which once manifested in the thoughts of a Socrates or a Plato, and the teaching of schools which, even in if in aberrant forms, claimed to solve the problem of life not only in theory but in practice; that is to say the problem of Salvation, the object of the Christian Tradition? This preoccupation now troubles only a reduced number of personalities who wish to apply their efforts to the esoteric domain of traditional howl- edge, and who mere often than not remain isolated. What we observe is a general deviation of the point of application of human energies. If this is Paradoxical, it yet has its raison d'6tre. The increasing force of illusion is the intensified effect of the General Latv adapted to this compression of Time. T he life of exkrior man's psyche has hardly changed since the cycle of the Father: it is still ruled by fear, hunger and sex, the three principal drivcs of the GeneralLQw. It continues to be a picture of misery and chaos. Here, pictured by Tnucydides (460-395 BC), is a report of conditions of life transmitted orally to his generation: 'The country today known as Greece was not formerly inhabited in a pen manner, but was the scene of frequent migrations. People abandoned their without grief to makc pIacc for waves of newcomers. 'Sine thtrt was neither commerce, not reliable communication, either by land or sea; evcryonc txpIoitcd the Iand individually to the measure of his nerds without thinking of becoming weaIthy, withour even establishing plantations (since with open towns they never knew when harvests would have been taken by marauding strangem); and last$, because thtp expectad to find their daily sustenance wherevet they wtrc, people migrated without difficultys4 The situation had hardly changed thirteen centuries later, as Masoudi (90&956), a learned Arab author, notes. He explained the mass movement of a certin population by its desire to escape from the twin caIamities of and war.' The cruelty of wars and revolutians during the XXth century demon- strates rhat exterior man has made little progress morally: it would even be possible to find arguments in favour of regression on that plane. I n historical times the quality of fauna and flora has been considerably transformed through man's influence. The significance of this is that these two kingdoms have placed finer and finer energies at the disposal of the transmitter station. This does not apply to man: Indittiduidlitjes aside, the evolution of the human species, in the esoteric sense of the term, is a most debatable phenomenon. Conversely, the considerable growth of the hu- man population plays an appreciable role in the evolution of the increased power of the frun~mitftrst,ation. Ths is a recent phenomenon, as can be seen from the examples quoted above. In the Xth century of our era Earth was still sparsely populated. Seven Hungarian tribes and one Khozar tribe were then able to settle in the terntory which now constitutes Hungary, which the Slavs had abandoned to emigrate northwards. In the same way, conquerors found the Americas and Siberia almost empty in the XVIth century. It seems that the popula- tion of the world maintained itself for many centuries at a figure that did not exceed a few hundred milZion inhabitants. Then, during the contem- porary period, it started to increase rapidly. The annual rate of growth nowadays is of the order of 1.6%. Demographers estimated that in 1955 the world's population amounted to approximately 2,700 million souls, that it will exceed three billion by 1962 and will double again before the end of the century.6 4.

Though the global intensity of transmission has grm-n considerably during contemporary history, the spectrum of energies transmitted down to the end of the Rq of Creation remains incomplete. In hct, it lacks massive amounts of the finest energies of the psyche: particularly emo- tional and spiritual energies. Only the evolution of man would be able to ensure their transmission in sufficient quality and quantity. As the growth of the human being is in fact complete, his evolution is now dependent on his development. The latter is essentially a process of refinement dlowing him to pass from kncwledge to ~nderstanding. Let us take an example. Recent scientific discoveries have enabled us ro send instruments into space which, depending on their positioning, form for the Earth a new link either with the Tessaracosnros or with the Mesocormos. This IS an important step which not only contributes to the full realization of the Rq of Creation but will also help to bring our Mixf~s Orbis considerably closer to the Defiterocosmos. Have the far reaching consequences of these events been fully under- stood? Here we should make a distinction between their significance on the esoteric plane and the scientific. Yet even about the latter uncertainty exists, despite widespread publicity for this penetration of other worlds. For the great majority, interest in ir does not go beyond intellectual curi- osity and even this has become blunted because of the growth of man's incapacity to be astenisbed the loss of his seme of wonder. Instead, a feeling of vaniry is aroused in most people, a feeling which reinforces their sense of self-satisfaction, that servant of the Gentmi Law whose cflorrs tend to obstruct moral evolution. This same GmeralLcaw makes man react against unpredictable novelty and makes him sceptical of miracles, those signs from higher planes, and instills in him a hatred for those who try to awake him: 0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, #Ad# tbad aillest the and .rtones# these that are refit to thee, said ~esus.' In modern man particularly the overtraining of the htelIectua1 centre aggravates the critical sense8 which at the same time facilitates his access to knowledge while limiting his ability to understand. Knowledge (saivoir) Is compatible with sleep, but to understand (camprendre) requires an awakened curiosity guided by intuition, and as it grows deeper it leads to a desire for liberation. It is understanding that 7. Matthew xxiik 37; Luke xiii: 34. 8. The intellectual sector of the negative pan of thc intelIectua1 centre. See Vel.

When is compares the warnings given in the scriptures with the signs that advances in technology have inscribed in the firmament, it is under- ,tmding that becomes anxious: So Jiketvise 9 ye, whenye shall see all th things, hw that it iis gear, wen at the doorr.

However, the source of the danger exists in man himself rather than in the circumstances as is clearly shown in St Peter's lh text commented on in the first t.olume where an alternative is offered, which says on the one hand: Birr the heavenr md the earth, which me nwv, & the same word are kept in $tore, reserved ~nfojre against the day o fjdggmend andperdition of ingody men . . .

If we wish to achieve sufficient mastery of ourselves to ward off a cat- astrophe similar to those which the Holy Scriptures have recorded, it is urgent that we should direct all our forces in order to know ourselves. T o better understand the creative meaning of man's work on himself, we must put it in context with the creative forces at work in the Universe. We have seen that the essential princip~e's of the creative energy from the Absolute 1 is Lwe. In our present state of being we are unabPe to perceive, conceive or even imagine the nature, magnificence and power of this abxol~te .pirim) Love which, as it reaches the Dwferocosmos, receives the emotiml and mental (pgcbique) support of the Absolute D, the DO of the LferaIOcfme, whose force reaches the whole planetary world, causing this mental, this ceIe~fiaI Love ro resonate, penetrating and exalting orgmic lye and so vivifying the whole Earth. To rhis is added ihe Love coming from the Absolute HI, rornal or Terrestrial Love. In the form of sexual energy in all the variety of its manifestations, this mIes the Tritocosmox and ensures the reproduction of the species. Love, in these rhree forms, reaches, bathes and brings life to the whole Universe. A Noilmenon, a direct and independent emanation of the Absa- Iute, Love gives itself without restriction. Yet man constantly tends to subordinate this noumenal force to the ends of the Personality, which belong to the category of phenomena. How many unions are dictated by ambition or by social and similar considerations. This attitude is sa- crilegious for-as the Creation is founded on Love-every offence against Love is an offence against God. And the Tradirion says: God lmres to thepoint ofjea/arcy, We can say that the exploitation of love for practicalends breaks the universal equilibrium at this point and drags down to an egotistical level that which belongs in essence to higher planes. It is not surprising in these conditions to see that blasphemy against Love, who is Spirit, leads to monstrous situations, to moral bankruptcy and even to crime. Let us summarize what has just been said: 15. I John jv: 8. 1 I The three cwrents of he are: spiritd Lwe emanating fsam the AbmP~tt I, rnentaJ (pgttriqite) be emunatingjrom the Absolate II, and camdbe emunat- gng from the Absolute III; thy permeate a!! orgdnic lye on Earth. Meanwhile, man done has the ability to capture and live them all. But to grasp and fully (itrtegralb) experience the psyche\" Love, the giving, the courteous, the love of Christ, is given to man ody to the degree that a m~pefi~ centre has been formed within him and this has then been absorbed by his higher emotional centre. As for spiritual Love, that of the Holy Spirit, to reach this he must have reached through the higher emotional centre to the higher intellectual centre. For exterior man, dominated by his incomplete Personality, Love is only accessible to him on th plane of the Absolute m: for alrhough he is penetrated through and through by the other two currents, he generally remains unable to capture them, so that they remain essentially inconceivable to him. He only captures and so only experiences Lo~e on the plane of the Absolute m, because on this level the sexual centre allows him to absorb and re-radiate the creative energy which ensures procreation. In addition, this Love includes a promise, an Ariad- ne's thread: by modifying his attitude to it, by evading its animal aspects, man can stem the current. This transformation is only possible with the sublimation of sex following esoteric evolution, when the man who today is an exterior man ceases to be so. We must nevertheless constate that exterior mnn feels the transcendent character of the Love arising from the Absolu te I and Absolute 11. The first in essence reaches his consciousness in the form of a perception of exis- tence. Bur he considers the beauty of the Universe and its life as mere information, instead of as a marvellous gift capable of constantly stirnutat- ing hs sense of wonder and kindling his gratitude. In relation so the Absolute II his attitude differs, at least in appearance. Human intelligence pays homage to the greatness of Jesus' sacrifice on the Cross. Yet man above all wants to consider hirnsdf as the beneficiary of the sacrifice of his Lord, who appears to him essentially as his Saviour: salva- tion seems to him an acquired right:% reward for the divine sacrifice. For the 'I' of the Personality these manifestations of Love on a higher plane therefore remain outside its sense of reality. 16.

In this diffusion, starting from its centre, we have seen that Love changes, if not in nature at least in intensity, so that it loses mare and more of its refinement. If we consider our Rq of Creatioion, we observe a whole scale {echelle) of values in radiations emitted by the Central Sun, by our Sun, then by the Earth and finally by the Moon.

Because it comes from a nournenal force, it cannot be totally subordinated to the demands of the Personality, that sdection of the 'World', as it is called in the scriptures. Man implicisIy recognizes this fact by his profound sympathy towards the sincere passions. Art and literature abound in hymns to human love. When some work has as theme a conflict between a passion and social imperarives, the triumph of duty receives the apprwal of our thoughrs but does not win the assent of our hearts. When a jury acquits the author of a crime of passion, it means that over and above the case submitted to them they want to recognize the transcendent character of passionate love. Esotericism reveals the source of this error committed by jurors. They attribute the characteristics of human Love to passionate love, through which man binds himself to the animal world by his fall from LA to the SOL of the lateraIocfuve. But an animal has control neither over its actions nor over its attieude toward these actions. Exterior man has no more control over his actions: for example QVer adultery which has been the motive for crime and yet, participating in the LA of the lateral octave and endowed with an intellectual centre and so with a critical mind, he remains responsible for his attitude to his actions. This responsibility is the basis of the doctrine of sin. Apart from the general ends it is called on to serve, For the human being animal love is a means and not an end.

In the case of the Earth and the Moon the Absolute ITI, who ensures the procreation of species on earth, is also charged with the vivification of the satellite, If we correct for the time factor these mechanisms are comparable from one stage to another, although the analogy should not be stretched too far because of the roles assigned to each step in the larger context. What, in broad outline, is the mechanism and form by which the trms- mitter statiofp, Earth, communicates solar energy to its satellite? How can energies produced by human activity, paaicularfy the energy produced by sexual fife in its widest sense, reach the Moon and bring it to life? To simplify the explanation5 we shall only consider two of the many movements of the terrestrial world; its gravitation around the Sun and its rotation about its axis. In the first of these movements the indination of the ecliptic produces a seasonal rhythm that becomes more and more distinct the furher we move away from the equator. Obedient co this rhythm, floral life passes rhrough four phases: sowing, growth, development, which ends by its bearing fruit -and rest. The unfolding of these phases is far less apparent for fauna, and even less for man in whom the normal rhythms of city life mask them without entirely eliminating them. In its natural course this produces a pulsation in organit /ye. The inversron of the curve from one hemisphere to the orher does not produce total compensation: rhe extent of cultivated lands and the density of population show a net balance in favour of the Northern hemisphere, which consequently captures and emits much more radiation. 4.

The day is devoted, above all, to mundsne fife, to actions which so often entzil negative emotions; the night to private Life where positive emotions tend to dominate. These two movements create a specid mode for the absorption of those solar energies which, after all the transformations they have undergone in the atmosphere, reach ogatric Jfe at its bottom. In addition, solar energies emitted intentionally for Earth follow a specific rhythm of their own. In this the rotation of the Sun around its axis plays a primary role. Among the energies received from the Sun we must not forget those which reach our phet afterthq have been reflected from its satellite. Here, the complexity of rhythms is even more evident, as are the shades of influence they exert on orgmic lge. This influence is so striking that men who live in contact with nature seem always to have taken it into consideration. These brief indications can only give a rough idea of the complexity of the bundles of energy that organic lffe receives and to which it constantly responds. Nevertheless, they can give us a glimpse of the complexity and variety of energy levels to which it Is subjected. All of this concerns the quantitative aspect, but thequalitative element is no less importanr. In this domain the variations are even greater: beyond our book knowledge we know by experience the different influences that solar rays have on the human organism that is directly exposed ta them, as we11 as the same rays reflected by the Moon. With regard to the bundle of energies it receives, organic life acts like a vast laboratory. The range of transformations that solar energies are subjected to on our planet is considerable. This becomes ever more ex- tensive as life assumes ever more complex forms, and as the interaction between the elements of the psyche and physical elements becomes more marked. These transformations then combine to elaborate her and finer energies. Tlus qnahative aspect has important repercussions on the gtn- eral expansion of the Ray of Creation as much as on the personal evolution of human beings, and from that on the rest of orgu~ic l$. We shall have occasion to consider one aspect of rhis in the chapter devoted to nutrition. Once organic life has transformed these solar-or cosmic-radiations, the latter are re-transmitted to our satellite, and it is cssentjalIy that past of Earth not lit by the Sun which is the transmitter. Here is a new application of the law of analogy. The Tradition considers zhat each cosmos rigorously directs its radiations in the direction of the following cosmos which it is charged with vivjfyhg: and in the same way, that solar energies are not mechanically projected in every direction of space, but directed individu- ally to each planet of the system; so the energies emanating from Earth are directly oriented towards its satellite. This is the mechanism of rransmis- sion. The major function of argmicift, regarded as a laboratory, consists of he transformation of the energies that reach it, a transformation that is essentially carried out under the driving force of the Absolute Ill. Among the species living on Earth only man, by moving towards objective love, can in an appredable way refine the energies received from this force, These fine energies have very great power, and play the role of a cat&# in the process of develupment of the Ray of Csedon. W e must repeat that in essence this development contributes to the vivification of our satellite by refining organic lye on Earth. The ~criptures give certain indications concerning the duration of this trans- formation. One exegesis of Psalm 71 (72 of the Vulgate and Louis Segond versions) allows us to interpret its first seven verses as King David's vision of life on Earth during the era of the Holy-Spirit, when thejrcst sha1iPowish. The end of this joyous era is shown in a precise way: great will be the peace mrkl thf moon is remwedq6 Elsewhere, texts have alluded many times to a future metamorphosis of the Sun and Moon seen from the Earth. It is said that: the sm shall be tmed into Arhess and the moo# fdo blood7 These refer- ences clearly have a symbolic meaning; esoteric language often signifies life when it speaks of blood. J According to the Tradition, the whole solar system, SOL-FA-MI-RE of the Great Octave and the whole of the Zaterai octave, serves as a nursery within the Rq of Creation and produces new suns complex with their planetary worlds. Today's planets will become suns, their satellites pla- nets, and thdr steroids will form the satehtes of these new systems. The Moon will cease to be a sateke and will become a living planet when the notes RE of the Greb Otfas,e and the /atmloctaue both resonate in full. This can only happen wbm our satellite has absorbed a sufficient quantity of solar energy transformed by the Tritocosm and of such a quality that it creates an atmosphere. We have dredy seen one reason why the Moon always presents the same face to the Earth, Here is another. Due to its rotation around its axis, a rotation lasting approximately a terrestrial month, the whole (integrale) of the Moon\" surface is regularly illumined by the Sun. Conversely, radia- tions from the Earth ody reach approximately one hemisphere. They fill the space from the Earth to the Moon In direct proporrion to the power of the tru~strtibber statio~. The growth of this power tends to create a greater 6. Rcmoucd is a literal tmstadon of the Slsvonic: noxaexe oTknueTCx Qna. In the Louis Ggend BibIe we tiad: rmtiltkb mm~ i~m more.

The existence of this envelope wilI allow the Sun's radiation to exert a direct influence over the Moon just as it does over the Earth. This will corre- spond to the entry into the world and the birth of the cosmic Foetus when it has come to the term of its pregnancy. The increase in this potential difference will also accelerate the moon's rotation round its k~js: the cosmic newborn will take its po sition as a living planet: this is the conversion into blood of which king David spoke. Ir will then leave its orbit around Earth: in the Words of the Scriptures, it will be taken awq. The Earth itself, having accomplished its task of bringing life to the Moon, will also pass on to a new stage in its evolution: it will leave the M~mcosmos, entering the De~ttrorosmos as a new Sun. It will shine with its own light, and so our Sun will not illumine it as it does at present. It will be directly illumined by the ineffable light that comes from the high places of the Prorocosmo~. This explains king David's vision in which he saw the Sun b~md into darkntsx. N ow that we have gone further in the study of the process by which the Ragr of Creation is transformed and grows, it would be useful to emphasize certain aspects of the role that organic Iqe, and man in particu- lar, play in those transformations. At all levels throughout the Universe, life passes through the stages of conception, birth, growth, and finally development. As far as organic I~R on Earth is concerned, the first two stages can be considered as completed although life is constantly being renewed. The emphasis is clearly on growth and development. Yet in the role our planet must play in the vivification of its satellite, these two factors differ widely in their impor- tance to the effectiveness of the truasmittr stofion. These transformations to which flora and fauna are subject are to a considerable degree the result of important qualitative changes made to them by man. From this point of view, although growth still con- tinues, we can talk of development within the notes FA and SOL of the laferal octave. This growth and development are the conditions for an expansion of the human race which is now proceeding at a pace no human will seems capable of conrrolling. The theses of historians on demographic pressure as a source of armed conflicts, the warnings of ~~Irhusians, the restlessness of organizations responsible for the increase of natural resources, the propaganda of some governments in favour of birth control, have all remained without response, or at least with no teal effect. The geometrical progression in the growth of the population will ulti- mately place the accent on the LA of the laferal octme. ~\"t we must insist on another point. The keyboard of energies at man's disposal has been considerably enlarged during the contemporary period, ,t a pace which also follows a geometric progression. The elasslfication of natural resources should soon be extended to include energies drawn directly from the atmosphere, perhaps from even further out. The meth- ods positive science puts at man's disposal greatly enlarge the field of his activity, Wish progress in electronics he will from now on not only have natural tools and mechanicaI devices at his disposal, but also 'intellectual' tools, The exact range of these means and their effect on the pow of the frun~mitter statien is as yet incalculable. When we examine this problem of man's roIe from the angle which mosr concerns us, we should never forget that beside the quantitative dement of which we have spoken, there is an element of transformation which pIaps an essential sole in determining the quality of these energies in their final form. The multiplicatjon of human activities from underground to outer space not only calls on new energies but, through the transformations to which they are subjected, modifies the quality of radiations our planet is able to emit. We recognize the role that man plays indirectly in harnessing and manipulating an ever wider spectrum of energies. But we must also regard man himself as a machine for transforming energies. The length of human .life has greatly increased during the last century. Since the begin- ning of the XIXth century, the activities of the human person in all domains, among them that of sexual life, are prolonged beyond limits once considered normal. In this, as we have seen, there is a constantly increased source of energies of a quite specific nature which can play an essential role in the developme~t of our Ray of Creation. W ithout any false conceit we constate that man's responsibilirp has increased considerably during the contemporary period. And this responsibility continues to grow. The industrial revolution of the XIXth century marked the beginning of the transition between the periods of growth and development of organic I$@. Although this transition still coo- tinues, we may consider that properly speaking the development stage stasred with the use of atomic energy."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Even if the intemal bemeen FA and MI of the Great Oefm has not yet been entirely filled, the note MI of the lateral octave has already started to resonate. According to the law of analogy which applies to all develop- ment, the full resonance of this note must be marked by the appearance and development of new abilities in man, the primary element in organic lye. The Mixtm Orbis character of the environment in which man lives -a reflection of his level of being-curbs ths blossoming. In terms of the end in view, the crossing of the interval of the Great OcSaue and the amplifica- tion of the MI in the laferal octave should occur concurrently. Interdepen- dent, they both depend on the moral evolution of man. From this we can grasp the importance of the conscious efforts which will lead to the for- marion of a true elite, transformed by the renewd ofintelligmctj8 and capable of ensuring the full development of orpic life with all the consequences this development must have. On the human scale these consequences are enormous. They involve not only passing through a stage in the expansion of our Ray of Creation, but also the possibility for the whole of humanity to reach what rZle scriptures call the AccampiisAmetrt. t is probable that the perspectives of cosmic evolution revealed here will 1 be received with reservations by some minds. Yet one may see in this a new hypothesis for the birth of stars, planets and their satellites, a hypoth- esis whch may be added to those which already exist, since none of them has yet received unanimous agreement. This position could be described as positive scepticism, a position in which the scientist keeps an open mind towards theories that experience has so far been unable to disprove. In fact, positive science admits it knows very few things about the life of he cosmos, about what might be called its physiology if we chink about it as if its totality represents a living being or a collection of living beings. This domain of life in the Universe is undoubtedly one of those in which the knorabims of Virchow most clearly defines the limits of human in- telligence. True scientists art humble. They know these Brnits. Tkir vision is not dazzled by the tinsel progress of technology. They readily admit that positive science has run into or is about to run into walls that are probably impassable. 8. Romans xji: 2 nnd also Ephesians iv: 23. 34 me most recent probes into the cosmos bring us face to face with novelty which sometimes contradict the calculations and theories of our science.' me previous explanation of the development of our Ra of Creation is not based on human experience. Its source is Revelation. d As man's intelligence is enclosed within the limits that his level of being imposes on him, it would probably be wise to give up the proud divorce between science and religion, a divorce which simply cuts us off from the resources of our Spirit. Today there is no doubt that we can constate a change of attitude towards this problem. This fact is encouraging. The recognition and knowledge of our limits are the proper conditions for transcending them. To surpass these limits is possible. The level 05 the cultured man of our dmes considerabIy surpasses that of homo fapiens fossilis. HIS knowledge is incomparably more extensive. IF he now passes on to the stage of devel- opment as esotericism concei-~es it, if from exkrior man he becomes interior1' man, he will pass through the stage that Ieads to SCIPP~~ faire. By doing so, he will truly become homo faber. His level of being and his condition will be as different from his present state as the latter differs from that of his ancestor of the ice age. He must certainly not refuse this offer although it demands conscious superefforts in working on hself. This refusal would trigger the principle of Equilibrium, which burns the branches of the vine and fells the tree which bears no fruit. 9.

It is quite possible that no particle would exist in the body of an old man that had remained in him since he was a child.

(Vlndimir Lossky: 'Th virion of God', p. 3 1 .) resurrection was possible by his own resurrection. St John also alludes to this of resurrection elsewhere, but this still did not concern the gned resurrection. AS this is not sm immediate probIem in the Cycle ,I$~E Son, it was treated in the Gospels in terms of the broadest general- ity, The Old Testament theme of the lmt jdgernent is sometimes raised ,pin in the New. At an undetermined time the dead will be resurrected: all thej~$t, or agaln, all those who rffe i# their sepulchres, will be clothed again in &dr bodies to k summoned before the Tribmal of Gad. But a new theme merges here. This collective resurrection is sometimes associated with ~hrist's Coming; Therefore, this advent would coincide in time with the Cjcie of the Eloh Spirit. Before it can be fully understood, this theme of the Coming of rhe Son of Man, abundantly described in the New Testament, requires comment. Let us take several examples from the Gospels. The 24th chapter of St Matthew is entirely devoted ro this subject. There, certain indications are parricularly exact, as in the following words of Christ: The good News of the Kingdom shull be preached in a/! the world for a testitmy mto all nations; and then shall the end come.25 This deals with the end of rhe 'World\". We are in general agreement in thinking that humanity has reached a decisive turning point of its history today and that we are now at the end of one of the chapters of the evolution of our planet, of organic Ige, and of human society. TFhrs opinion is based on many considerations, several of which have been examined during our study. The evolution of posirive science and the pace of that evolution tend to confirm it. From the point of view which most concerns us we observe that the preaching of the gospel hs now become universal. Having spread little by little, in the XXth century it has truly reached every nation. Practically no cultured man exists on Earth who remains ignorant of Christ and his works. This condition having been fulfilled, we can take it for granted now that, in the Gospel sense, we have reached the end of the old world and that the Son of Mm is near, at the door.26 Now let us see how Jesus described his second Coming, which char- acterizes the New era, the Cycle of tbe Hob Spirit. Here is the majestic description given by St Matthew, a description to which we have already referred. The Sutr shallbe darkwed and the Moon shallnof give her light, the star$ shall/ap'l from heaven and the powers of #he beauem shall be sbgken. - 25. Matthew xxiv: 14. 26.

How should this text be understood? It is of course presented in sym- bolic form, By examining it in the light of the Doctrine described in this work it can easily be transcribed into modern language. The poetic image of angels with sounding trumpets to gather the elect from the four winds, from one extremity of the heavens to the other, is a message hurled by Jesus across the milIennia so that it can be understood and deciphered at the end of the Cycle ofthe So#, twenty centuries after His incarnarion. We must first understand who are these elect. The reader will easily understand that this concerns men who have crossed rhe second Thresh- old, new men who, by their second Birth will be confirmed as IndiYid~aIifies by identifying themselves with their real 'I: a particle of Christ. They will be gathered from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other, to form the ruling dite of the coming era. The reference to the four winds and the extremities of heaven indicates that the elect will come from every part of rbe world, whatever race and belief they belong to: as St Paul explicitly says, in Christ there is neither Jew nor reek.^^ That elite will have to govern human affairs as well as all organic Iqe on Earth. This centralization of power for the whole planer between hands of mpermen is the essential characteristic which must define the new order in the Cyle of the Hob ~pirif.~~ Conscious of his ral 'I' through a direct and indissoluble anion of his Personality with his higher emotional centre, the new man will be in direct and permanent contact with higher levels of Consciousness and with the Covenant of Love presided over by Christ in which, according to St Paul, He is as the firstborn tf mrzn_y This permanent, direct contact of the new men with higher planes explains why the second Coming does not require a new incarnation of the Son of God. The mediation of human language will no longer be necessary, as it was twenty centuries ago when Christ liwd.

It was already well defined by the Holy Alliance during the XrXth century. It has been expressed in rudimentary form by the emergence and expansion of international organizations. Certainly these organjzations are still weak and devoid of real power. Yet they testify to an irreversible progress, Their disappearance is inconceivable. As they are now they represent the embryo of what could be considered as the mimrf of society during the Cych of the Hob ~pit-it.~~ Their imperfection does nothing to weaken their political importance or their esoteric sig- dance.

Thus wilI it be made into a litring spirit capable of ruling both humanity and organiclift on Earth. In this way the Era of the Holy Spirit will finally be established, with all the consequences that this fact implies. L et us now return to the question of the general Resurrection as de- scribed in the biblical texts. We have seen that the latter offers us symbols which can serve seekers as a thread of Ariabe from the moment when the problem acquires the nature of a reality for them. It is easy to perceive to what conclusions we would be drawn if we took literally the idea of a general Resurrection of the bodies of al1 human beings of the adamic period, The bases on which it is possible to establish an estimate of the number of men who have lived on Earth during that period may be imprecise, but they can give us an order of magnitude. If wt admit that the appearance of adamic humanity coincides with that of homo sapiens recens, we can trace it back about fourteen thousand years on the basis of recent anthropological data. That represents about five hundred and sixty gen- erations on the basis of four generations per century. By estimating the Population of the world at a mean of about a hundred miEon inhabitants 32.

When we speak of a general resurrection, then, this does not mean the reawakening of every human body which has perished since God made Adam a living soul. But why did Jesus give no precise answer to this question in his teach- ing? One explanation could be that during His era and that of the pteacb- ing of his Apostles, just as in Old Testament times, the problem of the general Resurrection was of no particular urgency. The great psobIem, the actua.1 object of Chrisr's mission, was to open the gate to the Cycle qfhe Son; to help the most evolved part of the human society of tht epoch to cross the threshold which materially and spiritually separated the domain of the Father from that ofthe Son, whose hngdom, as Jesus explicitly said, is not of this world. We must give this statement its full significance. bet us repeat: Christ's kingdom is opened to man with the second Birth, that of Indiuid~alig, when he has reached the consciousness of his red 'I' and, through hs higher centres, has come into contact with rhe Covenant of Love, that is, with the Great Esoteric Centre, and through that with the Kingdom of God, with the De6cterocosmic life which is in fact not of thls world. Given theimmense problem whlch faced Christ with Elis divine mission, it was inappropriate to raise theoretical problems that could only compli- cate an already difficult task. Above an, it was necessary to avoid offending orthodox Jews by theoretical criticism of ancient texts when Jesus's work was essentially practical in its significance. We find the Master constantly preoccupied with appeasing psychological resistances of the kind demon- strated by SF Paul before hs conversion. That is why Jesus took care to tell those who felt they were bound by the letter of the Scriptures and by the past that He came, not to abolish the Law b~t to arcomg~i.fb if,35 I n spite of reaching the conclusion that the general resurrection could not be of the bodies of dl those who had died during the adamic period, the problem of this resurrection cannot be ignored. The thesis of the resurrection of the flesh is in fact accepted by the Old Testament and upheld by the Gospels. It is an article of the Creed, and an object of liturgical prayers in the Canon of Easter. 34.

Matthew v; 17. me question is how to intqret this doctrine in terms of the esoteric Tradition. For it seems a natud cuhhtion to the dramatic evolution of fie human species on Earth. This subject cannot be usefully raised without considering another age old pdIem, debated for millennia, the problem of reincaration. The two questions of resurrection and reincarnation are intimately ~&ed. It is not necessary to return to what was considered in the first concerning reincarnation in the true sense of the term and pseudo- Yet we should add the following information. To admit that man is endowed with an immortal Soul (Arne) as well as a body is to admit that this Soul has incarnated. If we consider the Soul to be immortal, it is not illogical to think that this faculty of incarnation can be used by it again, once or many times: we do not see why we should discard the argument of recurrence that is applicable to so many natural phenom- ena, Once we accept, with all Christian Churches, the principle of the immortality of the Soul, it wodd be difficult to understand why we have only one single terrestrial life which, in the great majority of cases, simply wanders from one error to another before ending in moral bankruptcy and then physical death. How can we believe in the silence and inaction of this Soul before and after its ephemeral terrestrial life - and ths in a Cosmos where everything vibrates in perpetual pulsation, caught up in mo~~ement that consciousIy strains towards a goal? This immobilization of energy, whether it occurs in an empyrean heaven or among the flames of hell, will always appear paradoxical in a Universe where everything is based on the interdependence of the elements and on economy of energy. We can therefore interpret the indications givm in the Tradition in the following way: the general resurrection at the time of the lmt Jildgemsnb is not the resumption of a body by billions of Souls, each of which have incarnated only once, bat the incarnation in a single generabion ofail the Souls attached to ourpla~~et. If we consider that billions af Souls ate incarnated and periodically return to Earth, we will see the concept of the general Res- urrection in a new light. We should then be capable of understanding, for example, thaz from the esoteric point of view the progressive growth of the Population of the Earth represents a progression towards this general Resurrection. When the billions of Souls attached to the Earth all incar- nate at the same time, the era of the Holy Spirit will be finally established. nat will be the corning of the celestial Jerusalem, the Kingdom which is not of the 'WorId' that we know today, the world whose face wilI pass away .37 36.

For reasons already expressed,4 pre-adamic hurnmity was not able to evolve Iike the new type, Mixed unions risked a regression in which the tares would smother the good seed5 so that the possible growth of the human species would come to a halt. The Flood was a practical sup- pression of that risk. Animal tendencies had a much less strong hold on homo sapiens rects. A new start was possible, traces of it evident in every tradition. Man, son both of Heaven and Earth, could now look up towards hs heavenly Father. But this hurnaniry always needed firm guidance. Left to itself, it could only go towards Babel, where the confusion of tongues reigns. The need was for strict directives: a Law. The latter was given to Moses. The covenant of the Old Testamest was a response to a precise intention of the Creator: to carry out within humanity the selection of a chorerxpeopb who would then be the bearers of the Good News. Heaven became accessible again. Man, by his own efforts, could redis- cover the path to Paradise; she way so well symbolized by Jacob's hdder. Yet, despite the warnings of the prophets, the chosen people, particularly their ruling class, tended to lose sight of the spirit of the Law and to be attached more and more to its letter. This was a persistence of the primitive idea by which man connects himself to God through ritud. So St John, speaking of Christ in his Gospel, was able to trace a picture whose tragic character cannot be escaped: ... The light skbatb in the darbess; ~nd the Lr,&ess tomprtbended if not. . . . the *.we Lkht which light1 every man . . .

The victory of Darkness meanwhiIe was an illusion, since in the Easter Hymn this is still chanted: Christ is resurrected from the dead By His death He has overcome ~eath.' Nevertheless, it was only a divine victory, as man's rejection drove the fight from him. The Cyde of the Son has been marked by a confusion of wars and revolutions, by genocide, by a massive return to primitive pa- ganism, by extreme materialism, by the restoration of the Golden Calf and the degradation of Love, which has too often been reduced to a volup- tuous sensuality. If humanity, especially its esoteric vanguard, its ckosenpeople, had not rebelled against the teachings from the divine plane, Christ's Coming would have led to totdly different consequences. Under the guidance of the Master, human society could have progressed smoothly towards the end to which the divine Will had predestined it, the eschatological dawn of the invisible Sun which shines in the Cycle of the HoIy Spirit. Bur this is not the reality. The cbastnpeople, often rebelling against their prophets, also proved rebellious to Him that sent them. John the Baptist, the Forerunner, a Voice cr_ying in the wilderness,' was decapitated, and Jesus was crucified, His Apostles persecuted, and humaniry rejected the gift which - at the end of the Cyde of the Father - would have allowed everyone to start on the path of evolution. We must take care ro understand that the significance of this error with its tragic consequences did not lie in the refusal by the Jewish people in itself. Peoples can cease to play a role; they may even disappear, yet the task of humanity remains. The gravity of that resignation was due to the fact that it came from the cbosenpeople, the esoteric pioneers who were, to lad all the nations on the path which Revelation had traced for them. On the divine side everything possible was done so that man could hear the call. But he remained deaf.

Without this help, the process of filling the interval between FA and MI of the lateral oGtave would have been delayed so long that it. would have led to the rupture of our Rq of Creation at the same interval.

We must fully understand that without this powerful help from above to compen- sate for human shortcomings, the world in which we live would t~o longer exist. Tbat is the true meaning of Sdlvah'otl, which justifies the words of St Paul that wt are mved on& ifi hope.\" According to the divine plan, the two thousand year Cyde of the Son represent the notes MI and RE of the octave. They should have corre- sponded to two stages of man's further development, that is, to the ac- quisition of new faculties of psyche and spirit by the most evolved elements, which would afterwards have spread to the whole of man- kind. The latter would then be rmdy for the Accomplishment that would become the DO of the following octave, the rhousand year Cycle of the Holy Spirit. To better grasp the tragedy that resulted from this attitude of man when he was faced with the Mystery of the Incarnation, we must again consider the conditions in which the neophyte can and must pass, one ~fter the other, through the different stages of the Way, which are arranged in a descending octave in which crea~ion is the result of persistent efforts.'' The symbols, we may remember, were the following. Once having crossed the first Threshold the Fuithfd is called upon to climb the Staircare of four stages, symbolized by four steps one above the other. men these have a11 been climbed the neophyte, his Personality com- pleted, will find himself before tht sttund Threshold. Here he must himself make an extra effort to pass this new obsrade and enter the Wq-in the 12. Matthew iii: 17. 13. John iii: 1G17. 14. Romans viii: 24. 1s. Cf. Vol. I, pp. 216 ff."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"true sense of the term -where he must pass through the essential stage of Ms evolution by consolidating his development and pursuing it to its limit. On the Staircare, each step represents one note of the gamut, and each note represents a task that must be fulfilled before growth is achieved. Only the just can accomplish tach task fully. Others, the vast majority of those who seek the Wq, climb the steps without liquidating their hrmic tare at each step, so that a remnant of this accumulates. Yet the rule is that when they reach the second Threshold they cannot cross it without completely eliminating this tare, since only the pure can cross this Threshold. Now, face to face with himself, the disciple, with faith and courage, must van- quish the guardian of the Threshold, that is to say, the monster of the Personality he himself created, He must first judge, weigh, and separate the good seed from the tares, so that once his Personaliry has been purified it can unite with the divine spark, whch will then confer its resplendent beauty on him. On the eve of Christ's Coming, the elite of the chosen people were placed in corporeI6 before the second Threshold. Their situation was totally analogous to that of the isolated disciple of whom we have just spoken. The coming of rhe Forerunner and the Coming of Christ placed the cbo~en people, responsible for the whole of humanity, face to face with tbemselvef just as they had become by that epoch, after all their exploits, their faults and their errors. They should have had the courage to accept themselves just as they were, to crush their om pride: to repent, to listen with humility to the Voice crying in the wilderness and courageously obey the teachings of the Saviour. The cbosenpeople did not triumph in this trial. They proved far too weak to admit their awn weaknesses and transcend them. They preferred to suppress the testimony and signs from above. King Herad had the heod of the Forerunner cut off for the price of a dance, and Caiaphas, the chief Priest, after attempting to exploit the preaching of Jesus for politid ends, pronounced the fatal sentence: cotfsider that it is expedie~lt far ui that oRe ma# shottld dit for the people and that the who18 nation perish not,\" T he tasks which awaited humanity in notes MI and RE, tasks whose execution would have led by a normal transition to the DO of the Era of the Holy Spirit, were thus accomplished only in a very incomplete way by th t efforts of a few isolated Individualities, Today, having come to the end of the Cycle of the Son, humanity is again faced, at the moment when the 16. 'As i body' (Ed.). 17. John xi: 50-51 md dso xviii: 14. irreversible passing of Time has drawn it towards the DO of its octave, with a choice; an uIfimafe optioion. Either it rapidly liquidates a karmic tare grown heavier during twenty centuries and makes itself the servant of the Accomjbishme#t during the Era of the Holy Spirit, or else ir repeats the error of the chosefppeople and dooms itself to the fire. This is the choice offered by st Peter in his second epistle. These are the consequences of the catastrophe of Golgotha. T o obtain a complete picture of all the implications of the tragedy of Golgotha, we must aIways remember the inability of exterior man to discriminate between 'A' and 'Ba influences. He is therefore unable ro establish a scale of values which corresponds to Reality. This is the essen- trial reason why humanity is still ruled by the Law of Accident. However, the prophet IsaEah, evoking the image of the Forerunner, had announced what was to be the Mystery of Revelation and its consequences: A voice crying: Prepare ye th; way of the Eternal in the dcscrt, Level out the dry places A highway for our God For dI the valIgrs shall be lifted up Every mountain and kill shall be made law That every hillside will be changed into a lain And the narrow gorges into little valIeys. 1i' This was how the prophet saw humanity's normal evolution during the Cycle of the Son, if the Voice crying in the wilderness had been heard: normal evolution because it corresponded to the divine plan. But the active par- ticipation of the chosenpeople was indispensable. This evolution was com- promised by the resistance 05 the Sanhedrin, at first passive, then active, leadmg in the end to the crucifixion of Jesus. Thus the thoserapeople, instead of crossing the second Threrhold together as was foreseen, suffered a fall in which the whole of humanity was involved. About forty years after the death of the Saviour the temple of Salarnon was destroyed and the diaspora commenced, Due to the fall of its esoteric pathfinders, the whole of humanity was dragged along and has been marking time throughout the Cycle of the Son."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"he policy fo210wtd by the Sanhedrin dearly illnsrrates the inner con- Tdia in man, who finds himself at the crossroad where the oj Ktfmledge of Good mrd Evil is found, torn between the attraction of Heaven and that of Earth and almost incapable of fighting the inertia which leads him to choose Illusion and dooms him to obedience to the Ltv of Hqard. The Gospels clarify for us the meaning of a dramaactedoutin the time of and surrounded by a particularIy tormented people. Before trying to penetrate the meaning of an event which, from the esoteric point of view, was the most important since the FIood, we must lift into view the thread of events in the New Testament which are explained in purely human terms. It was for purely human motives, which reveal an exterior reaction to the Coming of Christ and to His work, that the Sanhedrin demand that the Roman procurator deliver Jesus up to them to be cru- cified. We shall first note again the constatation of St John the Theologian that spoke of the incarnate Word: The L&hf of the ivorI6, and the world had been made b~ Him, and #fie world did not ~GW Him. He came to Hix m, md His GZUH received Him no#.'ig Who were His awn? They formed the spiritual line which, starting from Noah, came via Moses and David to the presumptive heirs of the Tradition assembled in the great sanctuary and presiding over the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin's assembly room represented the AlIiance of Heaven and Earth: it was in the form of a circle, half fitted into the Temple and the other half outside. The seventy rwo members of that high Assembly symbolized the seveaty two langdiager from the time which followed the Tower of Babel, so that the whole of a divided and dispersed humanity were symbolically assembled there. We must emphasize that the Saviour's mission could only produce its efTectr if the eborenpeoplr adhered completely to His reaching and put its principles to work. Here we touch on the deepest meaning of man's destiny. In the Acconpli~hnenf he must become a perfect man just as Adam was perfect before the fall, but differently. Adam was in a scate of passive communion with the divine plane. Man, having tasted the fruit of knowl- edge, may not be united to God except by choice, by conscious adhesion to the divine Will through an Act af love. This act was expected from the chosenpeojle in the presence of the Mystery of the Incarnation, and should have led humaniry into the Way of participation in the divine work. The true destiny of man is based on this need to pass from the passive to the 19. John i: 10-11. active state. This conversion also marks the passage from mysticism to esotericism. The chosenpeople, then, should have received the Saviour, recognized &, and accepted him as suchPm That is what the Samaritans did, as shown in the GospeI of St John where it refers to the episode of Jacob's weU and to Jesus' stay in ~arnaria.~' The Samaritan woman recognized the Messiah in Jesus: Come, see a m, dich told tffe all things that I ever dbd: is rrot tAis the ~hrirt?~~ ~nd at the request of the Samaritans Jesus, accepted as the ~essiah,~~ remained in Samaria for two days.

Why did He not abandon Zion and the vaulting of Solomon's temple to broadcast his message at Mount Garizim in the sanctuary built by the Samaritans?

Afid asge go, preach saying, The Kingdom God if at bmdn2' We must consrate that Jesus, abandoning the line of least resistance, deliberately chose to confront the esoteric incomprehension of the Jewish dite even though he knew how dificult this would be, the very minimal chance of success and the great risk to which that choice exposed him, The text in the Gospel of St John indicates the reasons for this attitude on Jesus' part: Woman, said Jesus to the Samaritan woman, believe me, the how mmetfi, wheflye shall neitber itf this mwfain, nosyed at Jer#ralem worship the Fafksr.

It was towards the Jews that he had to go, since, being the ~hose~~people, they were the sole trustees of the Covenanr with God.

This was based on politicaI considera- tions. Above all, for Judaea to be freed from the Roman yoke, dissension among the people had to be suppressed. They had to be unanimous when they gathered around the Temple backed by the priesthood, the princes and the scholars. They must unite in the struggle against domination by Gentiles. From the \"worldly' point of view, this was the logical argument. 28. John i: 12. 29. john i: 13. 30. John iii: 3; Romans x: 12. 31.

Some ele- ments favoured compromise with the conqueror-if only Herod the Great had not gone as far as placing the Roman eagle on the portal of the Temple. It was from the point of view of the purely human interests of the Jewish nation, not of the duties of the chosenpeopk, that the xulers tended to evaIuate the activities of Jesus. He was a prophet, and contributed to the glory of the community. The most spiritualized elements were becom- ing more and more atrached to His doctrine. Yet this would lead ro schisms weakening the State of Judaea on the political plane. On studying she situation it seems that the Sanhedrin decided to use Jesus to head the resistance against the Romans, going as far as to incite the peopIe to make Him king. Yet that plan ran on the rocks. Logically, Jesus then had to be eliminated. For His Kingdom being 'not of this world: He could only be an obstacle to the unity of the nation and to the sacred political aim of the Sanhedrin-the abolition of the Roman yoke. St John reports this attempt to make Jews the instrument of national policy: Tbosepeople, when the3 had seen the miruth thatjesu~ did, said, This is of ra h~th thatpro$het that shoivldcorae into the ~orM, WhenJems thereforeperceived that thy wowld come ad take him force to make him a king, he dtpdrted ag&n into a mountain himserf alone.34 Jesus therefore refused, Did he not repeat incessantly that His Kingdom was not of this world? In the Sanhedrin's eyes, He must therefore be removed, since the Senate judged according to this world. A lthough political considerations finally prevailed, they were not the only ones debated. Mystid preoccupations, we could even say magical, sttjl existed. The cup overflowed in this sense with the resurrec- tion of Lazarus. St John teIls us: Many oftbe Jews who bad tome to Mary, and hd seen the things which Jesus did, befieyed in him.

Did he share the fear expressed by the Sanhedrin of a total extermination of the Jews by the Romans? Cerrainly not, since he bluntly told the assembly that they did not understand the situation. If he had reached the same conclusions as the majority, it was in fact for totally different reasons. St John said thar his answer was inspired. That is what leads us to maintain that it was based on mystical considerations. Let us place this answer in the genera1 context of the mission ofthe chosen people, Certainly this mission did not simply aim at establishing the super- iority of a single nation, nor was it just to maintain the national pride, for thepride of/$ is not ofthe ~atker.~~ As we have already seen, the aim was to establish a human nucleus that, by intensive spiritual culmre, would pre- pare the field ready for the Coming of the Lord. This was necessary to allow an esoteric vanguard to cross the second Threshold and, as Isaiah prophesied, to muk straight the wq leading to a Christian era for the whole Earth. As one of the initiated, the High Priest could not have ignored the aim of Christ's mission. Yet he would also have known :hat when their gIorious mission was achieved, the chosen people would &sappear as a national entity, just as the leaven entirely disappears in the dough. This danger definitely existed: the people could have followed Jesus without cating about the purposes of the Sanhedrin. For Caiaphas, chat danger was much more real than the Roman danger. St Paul gives a clear indication of how the Jewish people would have disappeared when he accomplished his task as one of the rhosen people by passing on to another plane. Tnr Chri~t Jes~s, he says, thre is neither Jew nor ~rtek.~' One of the meanings of this sentence is that in a ~hristimi~ed~~ humanity the nations, a result of Babel, were called on 35.

History gives us many other testimonies of this prevalence of Eairh over race. And we know now that those of the cha~*jeople who accepted the New Testament and received baptism have disappeared as a entity. This phenomenon of the assimilation of the Jews by Baptism has continued to the present time. As St John said, Caiaphas must, by inspiration, have been conscious of the inevitable consequences of a massive conversion of his people. He was led to conclude that if baptism threatened the whole nation it was necessary to kill Jesus. That meeting of the Sanhedrin was quite decisive. From that dg, reports St John, thy resolved to pput him to dtdh.39 These were the considerations which led to the crucifixion of the Sa- viour. If they differed in their inspiration, they led to the same end. This was to prefer blood to the way of Salvation and to reject, in favour of this worId the Kingdom which does not belong to it. I f the chosetrgeople had fused with the narions this would have allowed them to play their role of mystical fecundation in the very heart of them all. From the esoteric point of view, this task represented the summit of the activity of a people dedicated to the seAce of the Divine. By refusing baptism, the Jewish people preserved their identity in the face of the 'World', just like the Gentile nations. Yet for this they had to pay a heavy tribute; Caiaphas' calculation proved false, This was because Jesus' warning had not been fuIly understood even by the sages of Israel: Hui~ejau rimer read in the scr$t#res: the stone which the b~ilders ref115ed is become the bead stone offhe corner.40 Therefore 1 JQ unto 1011, the Kingdom of God shall be taken fromya~ and git~e~ to a nation forth the fruits 39.

That would have been the way of its Salvation. But it was saved only in hope, as St Paul said. Meanwhile this hope, a faint echo, represents the confirmation of the Promise. It was a sthstitution forrnida, the fruit of the terrible sacrifice to which His Love had led Jesus. The threat of agenerd Death was overcome, compensated by the fact that, voluntarily and with love, Jesus had offered himself as a sacrifice for the rebe1 chos~~~pojk.

This is why man can still face with hope the test he must undergo at the beginning of the Cycle of the Holy Spirit. This test is dreadful because it isfind.

This voluntary passage from Earth's plane to a higher plane, itfused by themass of peopIe, can always be (and is} carried out by individuals.

In the first epistle to the Corinthians, St Paul indicates rhe best Wq and the besfgryd~: Faith, Hop and ~oue,' T he path that human beings and, finally, adamic humaaity as a whole must follow on ths Earth, is that which leads from the Love of the Absolute Ill, thaf residge2 of celestial ZW: to the Love of the Absolute IIm4 This is the general requirement for Salvation. This concerns the Wq which leads to the resurrection5 or second Birth. But to be reborn the final test that man must pass is rhat of true Only he who has mastered his Personality and burns with this Love can cross the stcond ThreskoM. And before he reaches this point the faitbfd, upheld by the ardent desire for Salvation, must pass through the intermediate stages. He must give proof of his Faith, then of Strength nourished by Hope. Before he attains Love, the novice must first acquire Discernment, and he cannot do this without having attained Knowledge. It is to thisgnosis that St Paul refers when he describes the prowss in which each stage envelops and absorbs the stage or stages which precede it, and when he spedes that the passage from Hope to Love is marked by the renewal of the mind (intelligence),' that is to say, by ~nowled~e.' This stage ofpsi~would have been fully attained today, at the end of the Cycle of the Son, if Christ\" mission, as it was first conceived and without the substitution formula, had not Failed for the reasons explained in the previous chapter. 1- I Corinthims xii: 31 and xiii: 13. 2.

The irreversibility of Time applies even in the esoteric domain. Instead of marching on from one spiritual victory to another on the way mapped out by Jesus, humanity underwent a fall. It became the victim of lower types of human mentality: ofthe cdculation and (self-)inrerest which it eventually placed at the top of the scale of human values. Thus the gulf between moral and material progress gradually widened, a gulf which was to become a grave obstacle to the practical application of the Gospel principles.

Yet the second fall, as we have already seen, was much more serious than the first. The CycIe of the Son, which should have been the Cycle of triumph for man, became a Cycle of Repentance.

This cycle is a tragic testimony of the unequal struggle in each of us between light and darkness. Yet with the passage of time, cycle by cyde, the degree of truth demanded of man continues to increase. We will soon return to ths point. But even now we should ask the question: is humanity ready to face the passage to the Cycle of the Holy Spirit? Is there a ruling class and an elite-the distinction is essential - capable of leading it through this passage? This is an agonizing question for all who are conscious of its urgency. Many of us can feel its urgency yet prefer to turn back towards the past. Basing our judgement on what has gone before, we continue to count on the forbearance God showed us on the occasion of the two previous falls. This is an error. Humanity has exhausted its credit. Its actions today must fulfil divine expectations.21 17. Gmcsis iv: 15. Quoted according to the Slavonic text. 18. Matthem xii: 31. 19. Matthew xii: 32. 20. Matthew xviii: 11. 21. Cf.

More precisely, there is an analogy between the present eta and that of the Forerunner. That is why it is important to examine the reasons that prevented John the Baptist from fulfilling his task. That task was to mdke strait the ways oJl the ~ord?' to prepare the Jewish society and people to receive the Gospel of the King- dom. The captivity and death of John the Baptist, charged with this preparatory mission, lacreased the difficulties of Jesus' mission. The atmosphere in which the Forerunner had begun his work was not unfavourable. Herod\" dynasty was not imbued with the spirit of Jewish consernatism. Its members had been converted to Judaism but because of their ~dumean~~ origins they kept some independence from their milieu. This posirion particularly explains the policy that they followed towards the Sanhedrin on the one hand and the Roman authorities on the other. Now Herod Antipas, who reigned at the time of Forerunner's ministry was well disposed towards John the Baptist, whom he took for a just and saintly man. But Saint John found fault in him for his marriage to Herodias, his niece, the former wife of Herod-Philip, his brother. Herodias first managed to bring about John the Baptist's arrest, then his execution. From the point of view of esoteric work it is important, as far as the scriptures permit, to analyse the causes of the Forerunner's elimination. Did Herodias act on her own behalf, for revenge, or was she an instrument of powers of darkness who used her for their own ends? And were not these powers already at work when Herod she Great tried to eliminate the infant Jesus by ordering the massacre of the innocents? We can say that the birth of the King of the Jews foretold by the Magi did cot represent a personal threat to Herod, but a danger that existed in the far future. After a troubIed reign, Herod the Great had by then reached the age of seventy two years'3 and would die one year after Christ's birth. Nevertheless, St Matthew t&s us that he had been hsturbed-and all Jerusalem with him. In fact, the king did not take his decision until he had gathered all the bkh priests and scribes of t~ejbeople.'~ Certainly the work of preparation now rakes a form that differs greatly from that which it assumed in the time of John the Baptist. Yet hostile 22. Matthew iii: 3. 23. Idamaca was the Greek name far the land that in the Bible is named Mom. (Ed.) 24. Herod the Great, mlled the Ascnlonite. mn of Antipatcr, prime minister of Hyrcan II, last of the Macchabcts, was born in 72 BC. 25. Matthew ii: 1-4. powers can emerge at any moment. It is essential has all those who are preoccupied with the evolution ofhumanity, in the esoteric meaning of the word evolution, be vigilant. for it is from amongst them that the new elite must be recrujted, collectively able to play a preparatory role anaIogous to that of the Forerunner. They must therefore watch to frustrate the actions of those who, cofisciously or unconsciously, serve the forces which wish to ser back the progress of man. The Scriptures draw our attention to the need far such vigilance. We will have noticed that the Gospels of St Matthew and St Mark relate with precision the circumstances which led to the execution of John the Baptist. No detail in these reparts is superffuous. Every detail is meant to show the powerful effects that hu- man passions can have on esoteric work, and show how hidden forces know how to use, for their own ends, the full keyboard from the ambition of a Herodias to the charm of a Sdome and the concupiscence she awakens, These texts are simultaneously a tale, a teaching, and a warning that we cannot fiord to neglect. J ohn the Baptist was due to announce the approach of the Kingdom of Heaven, a new notion for the majority of peopIe. Today it is no longer a question of opening up the ways to Hope, bur to ensure the passage to the reign of Lwe and Truth. The Cyde of the Holy Spirit will be that of the Kingdom of God; otherwise, according to the prophecy of St Peter, Fire will be the penalty for humanity's refusal. Now, according to ~ri~en?~ if everything that exists proceeds from the Father md is part of Him, and if everyrhing that is endowed with reason participates in the Son, ir is only the mints, in the meaning given by the early Church, who participate in the Holy Spirit. This js equivalent to saying that in the next Cyde exterior man must lose the preeminence he has held until today in favour of interior man. In addition, the Holy Spirit being the spirit of Truth, the next Cycle will be characterized by the elimination of the lies which until now have kept their hold over To free himself from that sbvery in which the exterior man lives is a difficult task for him as he has not recovered from the first or second fall. Dominated by the 'A' influences, which he obsti- nately takes for Reality, he confuses the 'I' of his Personality with his real I I I . The Personality, which in fact clings to the 'I' of the body, is most often mled by the latter, particularly in the sexual domain. Those who must lead others do not generally escape from the rule of subjection to an undeve-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"loped Personality. That is why one of the most urgent tasks is the forma- rion of an elite capable of overturning the false scale of values established by the deified Personality. On the other hand we must note that humanity today is in a situation even mote critical than on the eve of the first or second Ed. We have already specified that a decisive test awaits: the complete elimination of lying. The Era of the Holy Spirit excludes dl compromise with ~nti-~lruth.'~ Lying, in any form whatever, would be an unforgivable blasphemy which would automaticaUy bring about a third fall. The outcome would be fatd, as alread inlcared in our analysis of the second epistle of the Apostle Peter? of which the following verse should be quoted once again: The day of the Lord willsome a1 thiqin the nkhf; in which fh Beauens shalIpas~ awq with agreaf noise, and the elment~ shall malt with femeflt haat, the earth ah and the work tb~t are therein shall bs bwned t4p.30 W e will still have season for hope only if the forerunners of the coming Era are in a position to accomplish their work. As we said, the danger is greaser today than it was on she eve of the second fall; on the other hand, the risks of a check ro the forerunners seem to be less than those that threatened John the Baptist, for he had to fulfil his task alone. Today the work of the forerunners is a collective work, and this very fact dlows us to think that it might lead to a successful outcome. But we cannot deny that it will be an arduous task. Ir must be carried out in a milien where conditions are, so to say, inverted with regd to what they were at the time of the first Coming: the rhosenpeople then refused to render unto Gsar what they thought belonged to God. Today, man does not want to render unto God what he thinks belongs to the Gsar of our times, that is to say, to the deified human Personality. The deification of the Persondity has acquired, one might also say, a universal character that is still more dangerous in its unacknowledged forms. Whether they belong to the capiralist or communist world, people today are unanimous in glorifying the human Personality. This is the major obstacle that the forerunners of today must surmount. 28.

I1 Peter iii: 10. 11 I ccording to St ~aul,\" before reaching the stage of Love, the very Anamre of the Cycie of the Holy Spirit, Faith, the essence of the Cyde of the Father, and Hope, the sign of the Cycle of the Son, must hssolve in gtro~is,, in Knowledge (Connrli~anct): the gateway to Love. Knowledge re- estabZl~he~ the true scale of values, and the result is that it subordinates the personality to the real 'I1. At the same time, the acquisition of Knowledge is not wirhout danger. It can make pride swell in the feeble heart of man, and this pride makes all evolution impossible. The track leading ro Knowledge is narrow runs dong a precipice. Only Personalities magnetized by a sufficiently developed mapetit centre can start forward on this way without great risk, because here the law expressed by Jesus applies in its full force: For be that bath, to him sAaJl begiven: and be that bath not,jrom him hall be taken even that wbirh he Knowledge is only a temporary or intermediate stage: it cannot be deified. Only Love reveals the divine nature: it springs from Gad, for God is ~ove.~%nosfs is an outer staircase that Ieads the faithful to Christ's Palace: to the Kingdom of God. [n that sense, it is the Forerunner-Spirit which presides over the esoteric u*ork of the faithful, the work which must open the gates to the Era of the Holy Spirit just as John the Baptist's work should have made strait the ways leading to Cycle of the Son. These efforts accomplished under the sign of Knowledge must fulfil two essential conditions. The first is that they must be correctly oriented. For this esoteric work must lead to a liberation from lying. Without this there is no possible access to the Era of the Holy Spirit. The forerunners should not fail in that area, where the rule formulated by Jesus is applied in dl its severit whowerp~ts hi3 hand to the ploggh mdl(oob back is trot fit for ths kingdom of God. 7; If this condition is not EuKlled, if the forerunners allow themselves once again to be attracted by the illusions of the 'World' and the Personalizy, they would not be true precursors, and their efforts would necessarily be doomed to failure. The second condition is that the preparatory work must be fertilized by the gifts of Faith and Hope so that it can develop ro the accomplishment of Knowledge. It is easy to understand that Faith and Hope must animate those who now devote themseIves to or will devote themselves to this 31. Cf. dso Vol. I, Author's ~nmduction. 32.

But for their work to be crmed with success within the allotted time, tach of these workers and all of them together must be impregnated with Hope and burning with Love. Only in such a state is it possible for them to come to this Knowledge (Connai~ance) and to give it the disinterested character whfch opens the ways of Love as it expresses Itselfon a higher plane, For Faith and Hope are the first fruits and qualities of Love, which belieueth all thin81 and bappefh all tbi~gs,~~ In the third part of this Volume we shall specify exactly the esoteric meaning of both these words, Faith and Hope, in their positive aspect. From a negative point of view the absence of faith generates suspicion and cuts off any zeal; while a lack of hope chains us to the present and prevents any expansion of thought and heart. A lack of Faith among the ruling class of the chosc~peopb led to the failure of both John and Jesus. Their sufferings, and the martyrdom of fhe saints and apostles were needed ta surmount this failure.\" In their sacrifice they were moved by the Hope that men were not dl bad, and that the seed could fallongoodmrth and so bring forth much fruit.\" Today, a lack of both Faith and Hope would provoke the third falk for the fullness of Hope must be accomplished at the moment when the Cycle of the Son comes to its end. This means that the fullness of Faith and Hope must be realized by those who prepare the ways for the Era of the Holy Spirit. By living out this fullness, each forerunner must clothe it withn himself with a Knowledge which would allow him to enter inro the Kingdom of Heaven even while being begotten by itB3' W e may hope that this deveIoprnent of Knowledge, if it occurs, will pass beyond limited esoteric circles and have an influence on man's major decisions, decisions oriented toward cosmic interests. To be more exau, let us say that esotericwork tends to facilitate the task of humanity in two essential aspects: in the first place, the Acconqpli~hment in the Cycle of the Holy Spirit, by attaining the deutexocosrnic form of Love; in the second place, the conscious participation of humanity - at first limited to an elite but then extended to everyone - in developing the Rq 4 Creation. The divine action favours the attainment of these aims: it works in the depths at certain points from which it radiates to reach the whole of 35. I Corinthians xiii: 7. 36. I Corinthians vi: 20. 37, John xii: 24; Matthew xiii: 8; Mark iv: 8. 38. See I Corinthians iv: IS. humanity. For this it uses Revelation, whfch gives man the possibility of ~enctrating further and further into himself, towards the Real, by devel- oping his Personaliiy to the second Birth. History testifies that the Word is spread by the mediation of those who have reached the level of interior man. From Palestine, the Gospel spread to the Greek world, to Asia Minor, then to the Gentiles of the Roman Empire and through them to Europe and North Africa. No matter what judgement we may bring on the hegemony of Europe during recent centuries, the expansion which accompanied it has allowed Christ's message to be spread over a11 the earth. The techniques it has introduced or developed have realized many of the conditions necessary for the Accomplishment, such as the newborn pla- netary consciousness, the growth of population, esc. The Divinity uses man's ambitions and passions for His own aims, but the realization of His ends often stems to be merely a &-prodacf of the most un-idealistic human actions. Yet once they cease to be useful in one way or orher so divine ends, human actions lose their raison d'etre. It is in this way that the European hegemony has lost all meaning in our century. But before falling into Lethe it has begotten those international institutions which contain the germs of the organisms that must gradually lead humanity to full con- sciousness of its unity, and so enable it to endow itself with institutions that conform to this notion. W e must again emphasize the fact that the passage to the Cycle of the Holy Spirit cannot be realized unless the interval between FA and MI of our Rq of Creafioon has been almost filled, and unless notes MI and RE of both the Gred Ocbaue and the Idera1 ocwe resonate together. The crossing of the interval between FA and MI in the former is realized, as we have already seen, by the developaent of org~nic li$e on Emth, partjcuIarly of its note LA. But man's efforts have created an unbalance at that level: technicd progress and the rapid development of population have enor- mously accenmated the biological. and material elements in the bundle39 of influences emitted, at the expense of the energies of the psyche, and even more of the spiritual energies. This bundle is thus incomplete, and the delay in the domains of Faith and Hope urgently demands the formation and then the actjon of the Forerunners. On the value of their work and on their access to Knowledge (Connaismrce), depends the fate of humanity and of our Rq of Creation. 39. ?Tic French wordjidi~~bm-translattd \"budle'-Is taken from the Latin '/arrinwr', the bundIc of rods carried by the Lictors to signify their power of punishment.

Esoteric actjon occurs not in a void, but in a context where the attitude of the public authorities, in the widest sense of this term, plays a decisive role. We have already seen this when discussing Christ's mission. The nucleus who wanted to follow him could not overcome the resistance, the hostility of the forces that invoked traditions established by man, nor the call of the blood. A similar situation could well happen again. The time in which we live is a time of transition, highly unstable, which tends to break with the imperatives of the past on political, economical and social planes, but has neither adopted nor even discovered those of the century to come. All today's problems are on aplanetary scale. There is no human action at any point of the globe, that does not have world-wide repercussions. 46 Things that only recently would have been considered as a serious attitude in political or social domains now seem to be dangerously frivolous. In relations between peopIes, it has become criminal - the word is not too strong - to use formulz that were appropriate during the Cycle of the Father or even that af the Son. To continue obstinately in this way would lead humanity to the third fall with its disastrous consequences. 'The responsibility of those in public authority is great since, as in Jesus' time, their attitude will be decisive. When the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, the intermediate period in which we live will come to an end and we will have to choose. For the time being we can only say that the great controversies of our time, whether in political, economic or social realms, are imperceptibly Iosing their significance. These are al- ready the quarrels of the otd order, the notions of 'righr' and 'left', of capitalism and communism, are already outmoded in principle. Soon they will be History. Me cannot predict what decision will be taken by the menin office at that dreadful hour. But that decision cannot ensure the salvation of humanity unless those responsible are at that moment conscious of the cosmic role the human being is called upon to play in the divine plan. I 40. Cf.

Saved in hope by the T ineffable sacrifice of ~im whom it crucified and mntinues to crucify, it has already received in abundance aU the divine grace which could be given it, as everything in the Universe has its limits determined by the i grinc$le of Eqilibrf~m. The refusal to receive the Life which is Light, and the twenty centuries of anarchy resulting from that refusal, have led humanity to the point where it can no longer hesitate. It was able to reject a Christ whose first Advent represented an intermediate stage, yet it cannot reject the Holy Spirit, nor the second Corning, for that would be to refuse the AccompIishmmt. So we are now facing a find settlement of terrestrial man\" fate. And since, in the process of creation, man represents an essential factor in the expansion of the Ray which terminates in the Earth and the Moan, his fate has inevitable repercussions on the life - organic or otherwise- of our planer and its satellite. Despite his extremely small size in personal terms, man is located at a particularly important point in the scale of cosmic values -at what we could call a major turning point -as shown on the following page2: This position of man is a result of his double nature: through his higher centres he has a divine spark within him; through his lower centres he is attached to the earth; he thus forms a link in our Rq ofcmation between the Kingdom of Heaven, represented in the figure by the uppermost 'squares', and the Kingdom beIow, shown by the lowest squares. These observations will a21oa. us to understand bettet why his deveI- opment so closely governs the expansion of the Rq cf Creation. Entry into the Cycle of the Holy Spirit should not have led to a crisis like the one we are witnessing today, because the passage from RE to DO does not involve the crossing of any interval. This crisis is the result of the fact that, although Time has brought humanity today to face tasks linked to the 2. In P. D.

In the same way, the members of the Sanhedrin could have ensured that the whoIe of humanity would pass onto the stage of development at the beginning of the Cycle of the Son. T hese considerations should nor make us too pessimistic. Without daring to say that the danger is remote, we can constate that the situation is better than it was at the end of the second world war. We are still in the midst of the tempest, yet a few gleams of light are breaking through the clouds to light up the obscurity. If modern man is sunk in darkness because he has neglected the cultiva- tion of his Personality, ifhe has the imprudence to taste all the fruits of rhe Tree of Ktlwledgf of Good find Evil, by the constancy of his iatellectual efforts he has at least achieved the most spectacular progress in technoIogy. Contrary to the opinion of certain philosophers, reIigious and lay, because it provides man with more resources which can eliminate many recurrent problems on the material plane, this progress can help the harmonious development of man intended to occur in Cycle of the Holy Spirit. B ut mat~rialprogress must be considered as a means and nor an end. It must not go beyond its role, which is to support moraI progress in ways appropriate to it. It is only by meeting this condition imposed by Divinity that man, fleeing from the curse pronounced at the time of the fall of Adam and ~ve,~ will be free to employ his talents7 working for the Accomplishment, instead of simply wasting them. We have repeatedly emphasized the fact that the moat between science and religion is the main obstacle to the achievement of this aim. It is mainly to this that we must attribute the gulf which today separates man's material condition from his moral state. Yet the idea that the isolation of science has been the condtion of its success, and that material progress remains linked to the preservation of working methods which must be completely dif- ferent for scientific disciplines than for those proceeding from Revelation, remains fixed in every mind, at least in the West. For the Westerner there is almost no doubt that the scientist has nothing to kaxn from Revelation and 6. Gmcsis iii: 19. 7. Matthew xxv: 25. that the traditional sciences by their very nature would give his researches a dangerous orientation. T here is certainly nothing new in man substituting a tradition of his own for the Tradition that has a divine origin ... and then becoming enslaved by his own invention. Jesus reproached the chosenjeople of having emptied the divine word of its essence of which they were the trustees and replacing it with rituals and human verbosity.' For it is a fact that human traditions create true conditioned reflexes which then prevent the exertion of the critical mind necessary {or adaptation to circumstance. The apostle Peter analyses this problem in the second chapter of his second EpjstIe: he tells how when those who had yes do see and .em to benr%crossed the threshold which separates che Cycle of the Father from Cycle of the Son, false doctors, obsessed by the past, were sometimes able to lead them back to the ancient beliefs. St Peter tells us concerning those docsors: 'Thv are wells witho~t rvakr, dodr carried awq u whirlwind; the fog of durktpe~s is reserved for fham. By spserhes mollen with umitg: they allwe tbro~gi5 the hsts of theje~h, fhro~gh mrrch wafitantless, those who wert clean escaped from them do litre ira error: WhiSe thypromise tkm libero, thy themelm are the slwes of corr~pf ion: for e~ch is a slave of nIkuf bas overcome him.

T he establishment of hrman tradition^ of this kind leads to true crystal- lization of thought. We can constate this again in our own times, and the danger is considerable whenever Statesmen endorse them. The appeals which such men project invoke human traditions whose contents have acquired the power of an axiom for the collectivity to which they are 8. Mark vii: 13. 9.

Certain aspects of this quesrion were examined in another work more than ten years ago.12 From the point of view that concerns us, we cannot afford to neglect this force from the past as a cause of inertia. It not onIy forms a permanent risk of conflict but, since it has already created obstacles to the possible effects of the Mystery of Revelation, it is also one of the major barriers obstruct- ing the way to the esoteric evolution of humanity. By leading to inaction, it hinders the broadening of our scale of ~ul~es, which is a necessary conhtion for human evolution. Meanwhile, we must not lose sight of the forces which, consciously or unconsciously, work to oppose the formation of a planetary mitrd (esprif) in man. These tendencies are berrayed by those crises in the course of which humanity as a whole has until now paid dearly for its passage to broadened states of collective tonseh~sne~~. If there was not in man this state of confusion between values, this broadening of consciousness would have been continuous, But the passage from clan or tribe to nation has required a series of convulsjons. Survivals of tribal consciousness, when they have manifested in certain Statesmen, have led to catastrophes right up to modern times. The example of Charles XII of Sweden is rypical in that way. That medieval knight, iron head, as the Turks called him, belonged to an earlier age in contrast to Peter the Great, pioneer of the renaissance oaf Russia and therefore of the entire Orient. We can also attribute the origins of the second world war to an eruption of tribal mentality. We muss stress that the concept of the national entity is itself recent. It crysta1liztd at the time of the French Revolution, which crushed the autonomy of the provinces to establish the me and indivisible Republic. Since then, vendettas between clan and clan or province and province have seemed odious. Yet vendetta remains the same whatever its bound- aries, and nationalism in no way changes it by exrending its borders to the dimensions of a country. But to shed one's own blood or that of the enemy for the glory of one's country is always considered to be the sacred duty of all loyal. citizens, and the majority consider rbat to refuse to do so is supreme cowardice. T beneed to pass to the new Cycle now requires of man, and particularly of Statesmen, a colle~tive conseio~sness which extends hr beyond the boundaries of nations or States. In the domain of public affairs what from the viewpoint of the Personality's level of consciousness seemed normal or 12. Cf. La pmbldmra dc I'aufrit/ mptr-btatiqw, op. cit., paifim. wen laudable during the XrXth century, is blameworthy today. Tomor- row it could be catastrophic. As we have seen, the widening gap bemeen the technicd and moral abilities of contemporary man is the major obstacle to the broadening of our coItecti~e eo~sciomes~. This first demands victory over that mechanical behaviour which teaches what we call the lessons of the past. To produce its full effect, this victory also requires that certain understanding of human relations taught by the Saviour. It is not enough to know (savoir} that these relations must be formed on new bases; this must dso be understood and lived by conscious effort. It is reassuring to constate that humanity is pushed towards that broad- ening of its coISetfive mnscio~~ne~~., towards unity, through technical pro- gress. We have already indicated that this unity of the world is being realized under our eyes, but not as the result of human efforts consciously directed towards that end. It appears, one might say, as a b_y-prod~ct of the activity exerted by man when he empirically follows that ill-defined aim: Progress. By that arm we most generally understand mdteriabprogrers. Man eagerly devotes his labours to this end and applies almost all the forces of his intt1ligence to it. Public education is essentially directed towards this one end, and political aims, together with the rationalization of the econ- omy in all its forms and the organization of the armed forces, all aim at immediate profit and comfort. Yet -and we see there a gentle aspect of divine irony - without being conscious of it, man forges the substance from which the world must be built anew. Greed is not the only factor which unconsciously incites man to create the conditions necessary for the establishment of the era of the Holy Spirit. The spirit of domination and fear ato contribute inhrectly. The perfec- tion of the engines of destruction that they have helped to create has turned against their authors -leaving them no further possibility of drawing any profit from them, In an atomic war there wouId be no great difference between victor and vanquished. Ashes leave no place for victory. 'War: said Clausewitz, 'is politics continued with different tools.' That formula has losr its meaning today. Force is paralysed by the excessive power now available to it. The reduction of war to absurdity helps to ensure peace. The facts of the international situation are thus totally changed, and prin- cipIes which only yesterday seemed axiomatic are now out of date. The m~~irn by which every iflternational is on& m expresfion of the relation between the forcer in troonfrontatioion loses its meaning now that treaties take the form oftreaties of conciliation, The right ofconq~est~ still accepted in the last century, has not withstood the test of two world wars: in the internatjonaI consciousness, the notions of right and of conquest now appear to be mutually exclusive. The notion of the equilibrium of forces, of a balmce ewer, has changed in its content. These transformations arise from the same cause: with the progress of technology, understood in its widest"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"meaning, locd or regional interests, whether grouped or expressed on a political or on some other plane tend more and more to be commingled with the interests of the whole, at Ieast on the material plane. If certain goals arise in man's mind when under the thrall of ambition, greed and fear, these at the same time also put into his hands the technical means which force on him what one might call plaroetury consciousness. T he causes of this evolution are not only those that have just been described. In certain men, who rarely belong to political circles, they arise from a higher level of consciousness. Together, they have stimulated the institution of international organisms. From the esotef c point of view, these represent the embryo of that political and social body whose struc- ture must respond to the needs of the new era. That bdy is called on, unless catastrophe intervenes, to become the ruling organ of ajdergtion of all nations and all peoples. True, the weakness of present institutions, in particular the United Nations Organization, creates doubt and impatience. Yet we must allow time to do its work, to form that organ of federation whose coming we hope will not be threatened and will occur in good time. For it seems that peace must be preserved, if not by the moral progress of humanity or by a superior level of consciousness in Statesmen, then at least by the fear of releasing forces that nobody on earth can control. T ouching on the philosophy of History, these considerations lead US to emisage a superhumm will which, beyond the aims pursued by man, leads us toward to its own ends. Certain minds which are cagable of sensing; this kind of action have referred to it in their works. 1r: a work whici appeared a century ago, Nicolas Danilevsky, talking about the Oriental Question, put it thus: 'The question of the Orient is not one of those which can be soIved in a diplomatic way. History leaves to dipIomats only the arrangement of current affairs. As far IS the great decisions of the world ate concerned, those which form the laws in peoples\" lives for centuries to come, it promulgates them by itself without intermediaries, amid lightning and thundet, Iike Sabaoth dictating the law from the top of mount Sinai. It is usdcss to look for proofs. The importance attached to the question of the Orient in everyone's consciousness is such that nobody has ever attempted to confine it to the narrow bounds of diplomacy. Not has anyone ever had the idea of pmpos- ing a conference to resolve it. DipIomacy, which dares much, sometimes much too much, is itself aware that the task exceeds its means. And it lives only to discard that question from the order of thc day, so as to cnjay the present times until the coming of the dreadful historical crisis which wilI absorb aIl the attention and all thc foes of peoples for a long time, telcgating all other problems and worries to the background.'13 One year after he had written those lines, the Franco-Russian war of 1870 began the dreadful crisis of which DaniIevsky had spoken. It lasted right up to the second world war. Since then, revolutions and wars of liberation have flared up here and there against the background ofthe cold war. Those aspects of international poIitics which led peoples into these codicts have been the object of a great number of studies; but as far as we know, nobody has attempted a synthesis. Now, if we compare the situation in Europe and the world on the eve of the Franco-Prussian war with that which followed the second world war we can perceive that in the last analysis the political fig:?ts and the wars that followed have not served the causes for which they were begun. Yet taken as a whole, they have changed the face of the world. Danilevsky talked about the question of the Orient; in fact his dnadfirs crisis grearly exceeded in scale the pro- blems posed in 1453 by the fall of the empire of the East. The wars and revolutions shafing the world for the past cenmry are only- as we can now see - the 'thunder and lightning' from within which the divine wiU dictates the statute of the new Era. What are the basic principles ofthat statute? We find them laid do- in the United Nations' charter. They transcend the principle of the balance of power, and despite concessions made to the principle of the sovereignty of States, they also transcend the notion of national identity. The Charter reflects rendeneies manifesting jn the evolution of international life, of which the most important is the growing interpenetration of affairs within states and betwem them, together with she growing influence of economic and social factors on whaz are properly political questions. In this way it becomes more and more dificult to separate the latter from the general entanglement of factors and influences which make up prrbIic Lye today, nationally and internationally. It is difficult to determine the epoch in which this process started. We can, however, find a trace of it as far back as the French Revolution of1 789 or even earlier; its contemporary aspect started taking shape about half a century ago, In 1898, Russia posed the problem of the limitation of arms on the international plane by inviting the powers to a conference ar The Hague. We know that then this idea seemed so revolutionary in the eyes of the invited powers that it was finally rejected. Here is an extract from that invitation, worth re-reading now that more than sixty years have passed, and taking into account the evolution which was to occur since then in the internationaI consciousness: Danilevsky, N.

To keep the peacc has been defined as the aim of international politics; in its name thc great States have concluded powerfir1 alIlances between themseIves; it is to better ensure peace that they have deveIoped their military forces on a scale previously unknown and con- tinue to increase them regardless of the sacrifice required. 'Yet all these efforts have not yet led to the beneficid result of peace that was hoped for. 'The growing financial burdens have attacked public prosperity at its souice; the intellectual and physical forces of the peopIes.

National culture, economic progress, and the gen- eration of wealth are patalyscd or warped in their development. 'Yet the more the armaments of each power increase, the Iess they fuIfil the goal at which these governments had aimed. Economic crises, due in great part to the cx- cessive production of arms and the continual danger that Lies in this accumuIation of war mstcrials, transform the armed peace of out days into a crushing burden that the people find more and more difficult to bear. It secms dear therefore that, were that situation to be probnged, it wodd fatally lead to that same catadysm which we originally strove to avoid, whose horrors make all human thought shudder. 'To set a limit to these arms, and to discover means for preventing these calamities which threaten the whole watld, this is the supreme duty which today imposes itself on aU the nations.\"\" After the first world war, another breach was opened in the concept of the absolute sovereignty of States by the vast problem of labour which erupted onto the international plane. Now, we wjll immediately notice the difference in principle which exists between the two quoted facts. On the internal plane the problem of the limitation of armaments is solely the responsibility of the State, but it was raised on the international plane within the traditional framework for inter-state control. Approached in this way, dthough the problem shocked some people as an unacceptable attack on sovereignty, the proposed method did not bring any innovation in international relations. The situation was compIctcIy difftrem where the problem of labour was concerned. It is enough simply to remember the 14.

Since the creation of the ILO, the international field is not the exclusive preserve of (individual) States, as it was before; the social factor has now taken its place beside the political, which is only the concern of the states, Those two examples taken from the many available, as they rnulriply at an ever accelerating rate, lead us to the following constatations: - Although the sovereignty of the State always subsists and is not subject to restriction, certain categories of problems, (such as that of disarmament), an no longer k technically solved on a national plane, so that they have emerged into the domain of international relations; - Certain social problems (such as that of the protection of labour), have taken on greater and greater dimension and become more clearly defined in character and can only be resolved satisfactorily on the inter- nationaI plane. Thus, since the beginning of thecentury the publicarena ofinternational relations, which was formerly exclusively reserved for political affairs and inter-state negotiations, has been, by force of circumstance, more and more invaded not only by economic and social affairs concerning States and the organizations of national governments but also by non-govern- mental organizations, W e can appreciate the distance travelled between the invitation made by Russia in 1898 and the signing of the UN Charter in San Fran- cisco. Yet this great step forward has been dearly paid for: wars and revolutions in the same period have cost the lives of more than seventy five million human beings. While the new internatjond law has been dictated by History amid lightning and thunder, factors analogous to those which transformed the feudal Stares into national States have en- sured the continuing broadening of boundaries and of the colkctive con- ~cionsness in spite of all the crises. This progress has accelerated over the centuries, allowing us to extrapolate that the world is rapidly evolving towards the birth of a planetary consciousness not only in political, but in Wonomic and social 15.

We are brought back once again to the problem of the new man. It is urgent to understand that isolationism, whatever its nature, is a decisive obstacle to our entry into the Cycle ofthe Holy Spirit. The Kingdom of God is not open to the rkb, in the esoteric sense of the word. We cannot colonize it in a bourgeois way. 4 S ince the passage of public life to a higher level of consciousness is linked to the formation of the new man, can we observe in human beings signs of evolution in the sense in which we understand that tern? We are not thin!iing here of those for whom that evolution- the acquisi- tion of consciousness -has become the aim of life, but of humanity in I general. Our civilization is incontestably beginning to develop certain faculties which should make it much easier for us to enter the path of evolution. In the first volume, while studying the Way, we sa~d that the most important stage is that which leads exterior man to the level of man 4. The characteristic of the latrer is that his lower centres have been devel- oped and balanced. Let us examine the influence of modern life on the lower centres, first considering the motor and intellectual functions. Our motor centre is subject to incomparably more varied and more refined efforts than those which must have applied only fifty years ago, Speed rules today's world. The considerably greater volume of travel, movement, and exercise to which the motor functions are constantly subjected by the general use of machines which have become more and I more complex, has led to faster reflexes in man, and a greater and greater ability to execute precise movements in very short times, It is particularly the quality of efforts made in this domain that ensures the development of the motor centre. I 16. Cf. Mouravieff, Lihl6, Egalitd, Fratar~itt, issue 129 of Syntbim, February 1957. I Since the turn of the century considerable efforts have also been made in the field of education. This effort is growing everywhere. The extension of school curricula must clearly keep pact with man's acquisitions in the intellectual domain. This pace is accelerating more and more. The child's intellectual centre is subjected to intensive training which reaches a higher and higher proportion of the country's youth and in some countries its totality, due to a general tendency to make education compulsory. Further- more, certain States have already made secondary education compulsory. Access to positive knowledge is thus open to wider and wider strata of the population. In spite of numerous deficiencies, we can say that develop- ment of the intellectual centre tends to follow that of the motor centre. The acquisition of these new abilities by the motor centre and the in- tellectual centre is no more than a h-proddltd of an adaptation to the con- ditions of life in the modern world. This acquisition does not in fact resvIt from conscious action directed towards man's esoteric development. The moral progress necessary for the passage to the Cycle of the Holy Spirit requires much more effort in the intellectual field: everyone must be able togive the full measure of his ability in this domain. Man must make his taknt~ produce all their fruits. He can only do that if he gets access to the higher teaching by which the highest forms of intelligence are developed. Governments have the sacred duty of opening the doors of the Univer- sities to everyone as rapidly as possible. T o take a full view of rhe fundammtal conditions necessary for zhe moral evolution of humanity, we have still to examine the most im- portant, the emotionaI centre-the life of the heart: the emotions and the noble passions. We intend to do this in the part of this voIume devoted to the Wq. Meanwhile, we should point out that if the culture of the intellect and the training of the instinctive and motor functions of the Personality have created the conditions necessary for active existence in the new era, they are still insufficient. Conscious participation in the realization of the Cycle of the Holy Spirit also above all requires intensive culture of the faculties of the heart, so that man becomes fully open to positive motions and closed to negative. If he also fulfils this requirement, man will drink from the water o the Lord which shall be in him a well of water springing up info everlafting IV~.~ i 17.

That fear is inspired not by the fad that we divulge the mysteries of Cosmogony, as this forms part of our Mission, but by our concern for finding language which will be clearly heard and understood. Although the old law was not entirely replaced1 by Jesus' teaching, it was superseded by it. However, the prestige of the Holy Tradition con- tinued to weigh heavily on the society of those times. Even in our times this phenomenon remains, but now in different form. Anything old weighs heavily on the weak mentality of humanity. This leads us to create taboos, and then we are able to go ahead with a light heart, our eyes tixed ob- stinately on the past. This is the major obstacle met by Jesus and his Apostles: an obstacle , placed by people who, thinking they were pious, put ancient customs above the word of ~od.~ Our fear is not inspired by people of bad faith, but from those of good- will who are attached beyond measure to ancient traditions and for this reason think they are faithful and dwell in the truth. This phenomenon is of great importance in the history of esoteric doc- trines. People of good faith are roo often the servants - in fact the most zealous of servants-ofthe GenerdLaw. So, when the word of God allows us to deepen our knowledge of the Truth, these pious and very sincere people, \"having drunk the old wine, do not desire the new, for they say: the old is Often we shall have to evoke this thesis of those of good faith who serve the General Law.

Yet to succeed we must first obtain some idea of God's Work of creation in its entirety and in its dynamic aspect. We mn then move on from the general to the particular. This requires courage and humility. With the approach of the era of the Holy Spirit, euesytbing must be gradually brought to the light of day, nor only the secrets of the laborarory but the deepest meanings of esotericism. The same must happen with illusions, errors and lies, which must also be revealed so that they can later be rectified. This process is already happen- ing. It is this which to a large extent explains the political and socia1 difficulties which characterize our time of transition. Yet only a Sew peo- ple know how to interpret the signs of our times. For it is now possible for open, cultured and courageous minds, inspired by that of the Forerunner of our Lord, to approach the light of the Mhd (itrtcJI&ence) of Christ and even to enter it. It is in this spirit that we describe the Universe, organic lye on Earth, and various aspects of the life of human society today as seen on the mesoteric scale. To study this description will demand a special effort of the psyche on the part of the reader. To profir from it, he must stifle within him all personal reactions of disapproval or even of approval. of these advanced theses. First, he must assimilate the various elements of the subject that he can understand, and make them his om.

Then, we gave the following warning: 'we wilt notice that while its action fills the interval between FA and MI of the Great Octme, the IaferaI octave must also be subject to a slowing dawn or deviation in the interval between its own notes FA and MI. How is that filled? We added: 'We shall return to that important question when we have acquired certain background notions which will dlow us to approach the problem in a more useful way.\"' The time for this has come. This question is of the utmost importance. If it did net in fact indicate how the interval between FA and MI of the lateral octave is filled, the account of this cosmogonic system would have remained fragmentary and so its value would have been incomplete. In order for this system to be fully functional, a source of complementary energy had to be provided - from which corporeal terrestrial life would spring in its three forms. That source exists. Yet we should note that it does not directly fill the interval between FA and MI of :he Great Ortrave. This interval is filled by the notes LA, SOL and FA of the laferal octave, representing organic ife on Earth; the autonomous human, animal and vegetable organisms. Since the system exists in Time, where everything must come to an end, its continued operation requires the continual renewaI of the constituents of organic Ife on the planet. This life, with all its dements, was conceived in the form of an alternation of births and deaths get4 de naix~ances et de morrs), ruled by the alternation of the seasons so as to meet the need for a rhythmic tiansrnission of creative energy along the Rq of Creation towards the notes MI and RE of the Great Octave. This ceaseless reproduction of the elements of orgmric /ye on our planet is the keystone of the whole Rq of Creatjo~."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"This diagram from the first volume of this work2 is not sufficient to explain the working of the Universe as it manifests life. As we said earlier, the question is: how is the interval between the notes FA and MI of the 1afsr.d octave filled. That problem is salved in the way used for the Great Ocrraue: by introducing a lateral ocfave, which plays an analogous sole in relation to the first to that which theprst lateraloctave plays in relation to the Grtat cosmic Octme. .* First intervaI (WilI of the Absolute) L: SOL DO of the lateral octave FA SI 1 , LA-SOL-FA Second interval (Otganic life on Earth) MI RE RE In certain conditions, the SOL of thefirst lderal octrai,e starts to resonate as the DO of the seco~d lad6taIoctme. However, the constitution of the latter is not at all analogous to that of the former: it is autonornoas, and this is the secret of its action and thus of the whole Ray of Creation. This secret is of the first importance. Some aspects of it are at the same time amazingly upsetting, so much so that they had never been divulged. The system by which the Universe works has never been the abject of a complete teaching; it has been given in symbolic form, but now it is brought out into the open. 2 Volume I, fig. 41, p. 101. A s we have said, the DO of the secomd Iateraloctrwe comes from the SOL of the first ZafdraJ oct@e. It emerges as the Absolute ID, the absoJute of the conception Pf corporeal kfe; or in a more generd way; of the process of incarnation in its psychological and physiological aspects. If, in our by ojcreation, the field of action of the Absolure II is limited to our solar system, that of the Absolute IIl does not extend beyond our planet. His action is exercised only on the elements of orgu~dc lge. He is the Absolute for everyrhing that governs the creation of conhtions necessary to ensure the reproduction of corporeal life: those that allow the conc@fim and then the birth of the elements which constitute the notes LA, SOL and FA 05 thefir~t httrdocduve. Becoming autonomous from birth until death, these organisms enter thefirst kateraloctave as au integral part of it, and they remain under the authority of the Iaws which rule it. The Absolute I'II maintains his authority over the notes SOL and FA. In what concerns LA-man-his authority, while concrete and great, is not after all absolute. In principle, exterior manis offered a choice. If he crosses the first Threshold by devoting himself to esoteric work, he can progres- sively escape the hold of the Absolute m. T he direct intervention of Absolute IIf in human life generally occurs at the time of puberty; he permrbs the organism by various mani- festations, from sexual attraction to a vivid upsurge of imagination which is the source of alt sorts of romantic and other i~lasions.~ The hold of the Absolute ITI over man and woman ends progressively from the menopause in women, and from the time of analogous trou bIes in men. Normal@, the surplus of sexual energy in excess of that needed for reproduction in humans is provided not simply for the pleasures of carnal love- wasting it for nothing- bu t to give these sad beings (maZbeure~x) the chance to escape from their otherwise inescapable condition. This surplus of energy, once mastered and utilized in an appropriate way, can assist in the growth and development of the Personality. It is in this that man has a choice: by beginning to climb the Stdrcase he places himseIf progressively under the authority of the Absolute II, to whom he will finally become subject after the second Birth. 3. the picturesque language of the Tradition, those ate the 'dreams of the slccpingyung arpctrt."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Sexual attraction and the pleasure of carnal Iove continue to exert a decisive iuffuence over those who still remain on the wrong side of the first Threshold. They actually seek this attraction, and it takes many forms because of the unlimited possibilities of the imagination.

A great part of the Doctrine is dedicated to methods which allow us to struggle against this dreamlike imagination, sometimes by ding on the creative imagination. 4 W e should observe that the distance which separates the intervals between DO and SI and between FA and MI of the Great Octave is much greater than that which exists between the same intervals in the firsf lakraiocfave. In the first case it extends over four notes: SI, LA, SOL and FA, while in the second there are only two notes. This is because the triad LA, SOL, FA of thefirst loferal octave, which forms a whole, has the value of only one note, destined to fill the interval between FA and MI of the Great Octme, In fact, the &stance between the two intervals of the second lateral octave disappears completely. The four notes: SI, LA, SOL, FA in their turn form a whole which in itself has no materid value: it is a procsd~re, It represents the neutralizing force that intimately binds rhe active force, the male vill of the Absolute m, ro the passive force, the femde will of the Aesh, which itself comes to meet it from the note RE of the same octave. -- 4.

After thephysicalbirth the fruit of this union, becoming autonomous, will enter the interval between FA and MI of thefirst /a#erdoctave to fuH its assigned cosmic role.

We will remember that the first introduced the Law of Seven, so c~rving the line of Time to preserve Creation from annihilation at bisthe5 The second artifice is realized by progressively shortening the second and third cosmic octaves - that is, thefirst md second lateral octaves -in order to evade the effect of Law of Seven, contracting the gamut to three notes, and so gathering together the three forces of the LW of Thnd which govern the techniques of creation. 5.

The Ray of Creation, which forms an octave, consists of the seven notes of this gamuc. The jr5f Ifiteral octm {or second cosmic octave) - as we have seen - contains in practice only five notes, so that the two intervals are already considerably closer together. In the second lateral octave (or third cosmic octave) this distance disap- pears, since the notes SI, LA, SOL and FA together form a singlegroced~re in which the rwo conjoined intervals merge. It is important to have a good grasp of this divine mechanism. The will of the Absolute I, when it goes through a progressive double contraction and takes the form of the Absolute m, no longer acts according to the Law of Swefi foUowing the scale of the third cosmic octave (or second lateral octave), but now aas according to Latv of Three, a productive law sponta- neously and directly oriented towards corporeal creation.

Fertilizedin this way, the feminine force accomplishes its cosmic mission of reproduction by means of the W#IE in note MI and in nore RE the womb {mtrice), the seat of feminine desire. Now we can understand better why the Microcosms, whose nature is androgynous and whose ?' is one but bipolar, undergoes a separation orr incarnation, forming opposite sexes that are mental (pythigue) as well as physical. In the second cosmic octave, the distance which separates the intervals hinders direct reproduction; again, this is why the series of notes LA, SOL and FA, which consists of every aspect of ~rga~it I$e on Earth, has been formed, and why it is perpetually renewed from brlw by the third cosmic ocravt. Thus human birth emerges as the highest possible birth in the whole Universe. Amongst other things, this is the reason for the Traditional statement that even the angels, if they wish to evolve, are obliged to pass through a human incarnation. For despite all its inconveniences, this is the only opportunity for evolution towards and through the second Birth. In the second cosmic octave, the feminine will acts on a higher plane. Its encounter with the will arising from the Absolute IT only takes place gradually and occurs in the interval between FA and MI of that oc- tave. %s encounter is only possible through the esoteric evolution of humanity in its two aspects: individually through the second Birth, and collectively through the general Resurrection. In both cases the process is an answer to the call of Grace and Truth emanating from the ~bsolute lT.' It continues until the namber is actomplis~ed.~ Then, when the notes LA, SOL and FA of the second cosmic octave have begun to resonate in full as a resuIt of a successfully accomplished general Resurrection, the energy of the Absolute III will change irs point of application: it will then manifest: in the sublimation of sex,'' and human beings will then be liberated from their servitude to rqroducrion. Everything depends on man's attitude at the approach of the Era of the Holy Spirit. If all goes well, the interval between FA and MI of our Rg df Credtfon should be completely Hled by that time. If this is so, the energy of the Absolute KI would then be progressively able to invade notes MI and RE of the second cosmic octave and in turn the energy emanating from the Absolute I would be able to penetrate the nates MI and RE of the Greob Octave. 8.

Unless there is a failure. Before going any further, we must introduce a digression. The Tradition is One. We said this in the first pages sf the present work.I3 We have also indicated that this one Tradition has been revealed and is atways revealed in different forms, each minutely adapted to the mind and psyche of the human group to which its Word is addressed, as well as to the mission with which it is charged.I4 With time, the revealed Word, sometimes handed down from extinct civilizations, is subject to damage due to human forgetfulness: it becomes fragmentary. Then it. receives arbitrary adhtians from purely human sources. With time, those conjectures are generally taken as realities. Apart from these mutilations, we should not Jose sight of aphenomenon of a totally different order. Divine Revelation, the source of all true Tradi- tion, does not crystallize into immobility through the course of millennia. Even though this may seem odd, Revelation is given in stages: metered out each time in a necessary and suficient way in answer the needs of the epoch and of the Cause. We can conclude that the study of traditional Knowledge faces us with three kinds of difficulties: a) Deformation with time, due to a fmgctfulncss that has rendered the original Revelation fragmentary; b) Additions by human sources; c) The insuficiency of the old Revelation bemuse of the evolution oflife in Time. 'She traditionalist spirit in human nature demands that once the Revela- tion is defivered it should remain the same forever. In this way, as we said earlier, mere antiquity is in the end taken fox truth. 11. Rtvelation x: 7. 12. Yolurnc I, p.131. 13. Volume I, p. xvij. 14. lbid. To convince ourselves that this kind of mentality exists, it is enough for us to open the Gospel and read that glorious yet sorrowful history of divine intervention in the firs of men, 05 events that actualIy h~pened among the chosen people. We should keep this ever-present in our minds as we advance in out viewing the Universe in terms of the three cosmic octaves. Let us repeat: the way the Universe works is no longer expressed here in veiled or symbolic form, but open1y. This disclosure is to meet the needs of the time of transition in which we now find ourselves. This is also so that we need not repeat the error of our predecessors of two thousand years ago, who did not have the courage to confront the naked truth brought to them by Jesus. Today, the time for parables is long past; the hidden meaning of the symbols must be gradually revealed. But for this one mast have courage or even audacity. A fter studying the system of three cosmic octaves of which we have just given a schematic account, the reader should ponder the precise signiticance given to the Absolute I, ll and Ill by the esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. To answer this, we consider it our duty to refer to the sacred texts, as we have done all through our work, although we are conscious that we will be spared neither bitter criticism, nor blame, nor even anathema. Our Lord and his Apostles, when they used the method which we are trying to follow, were not only criticized but even executed ... The world in which welive and act is made up of 'A' influences under the agis of the Absolute Kt. The 'B' influences come from the Absolute II, The first is the Kingdom ofthis World Car\" Kingdom. The second is The Kingdom tYhith i.r not ofoSthis world, the Kingdom $Heaven. The Absolute It is Christ, the Son of God who incarnated as the Son of Man, Ben-Adam. The Absolute I is therefore God the Father. Here the difficulties and dangers of interpretation begin. We must nevertheless repeat that access to Knmuledgt on the mesoteric plane requires courage, as it demands a special psychological effort from the reader: he has to accept the postulates expressed, although it may be only temporarily, at the same time as disregarding his own ideas and PersonaI beliefs. The critique, as we said, can come later."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"I CHAPTER IX T o make it easier ta interpret these ideas about the Absolutes, we will try togive a detailed classification of current notions on this subject as given in the catechism on the Old and New Testaments, and as presented in the first volume of ths work, which was dechcated to the exoteric cycle of the Doctrine. We will try to do so within a strictly canodcal framework, keeping in mind the system of the three cosmic octaves explained in the previous chapter. Our study will begin with the Absolute II. We have already said that He is the Christ, Son of God, begotten not created, that is to say, eternal and conmbstanfial with the Father. As we have seen, the note SOL of the Great Octave, corresponding at this point to the Defitwocosms, the Absolute H, causes the DO of the second cosmic oczave to resonate. We have already constated that the term De~temcosmosis perfectly justified, as aIthough it ody occupies the fourth place in the Grw Octave and in the system of Cosmoses, there is no inter- mediary of a subsrantialIy differat nature' between the Protocosmo~ or first cosmos and the latter - in other words between the Absolute I and the Absolute XX. It is interesting to mention here an indication given by Jesus, found in the recently discovered Gospelucmrd6rrgtu Thorns, in which the Christ gives his position in the Universe. He said: I took mj stand in the middle of the Cosm~s.~ In fact, the note SOL, equivalent to the De#t@ocosmos, is in the middle of the Great Octave and of the Macrocosmos. If we make the effort to represent the whole Deuterotosmos to ourselves as an Integral of all the suns of the stellar world, with their planetary systems and their satellites, we can perceive this ensemble which contains the whole Creation as the Bo+ oftb8 cosmic Christ.

The reader will fin$ it very profitable to study the relanon between the Father and the Son described in the Gospel in the light of the system of three cosmic Octaves. This will particularly help him to recognize in the Absolute IE, Christ the Son of God, Lord of the Second cosmic Octave, of the Deuterocosmo~ which - aas already said - contains and animates the whole bu4 of the created Universe. The solar nature of Christ's cosmic body was shown to the three apostles during the ~ranqf~wation' on Mount Tabor. By now, we can consider the identity of the Absolute II as Christ to be established, so that this point will need no further commentary. I t is not so easy to identify the Absolute I in canonical terms aIthough at first anaiysis there seems no d~fficulty. In fact, the Absolute I, Creator of the Great Universe, cannot be other than God the Father. Tnis assertion appears as simple as it is self-evident. Yet the evidence dissolves when we examine the problem more precisely. Many questions arise on xeflecrion. Before anything else, let us eonstate that the idea of God the Father, as found in the Gospel, does not appear in the Old Testament, although it is expressed ninety-six times in the ~ew.' This cannot be the effect of chance, nor is the fact that Jesus did not talk of God the Father as the God of Israel. In general, the Old Testament provides a quite confused image of God, a fact which is explained partly by the level of the audience to whom hfoses and the prophets addressed themselves, partly by deliberate hermetization, partIy too by different notions attributed to the divinity. Yet Christian theology - Jesus in the first instance, followed by the apostle Paul -has not only identified God the Father in that confused notion of the God of the Old Testament, but also the Son and even the Holy Spirit. Even then there remain a considerable number of mentions of God which do not agree with Christian notions of the divinity, for example that of the God 5. John vi: 57. 6.

To ftnd a reference to the Son in the Old Testament, Christian theology often quotes King David's Psalm CX: The EtcrnaI said unto my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand Until I make of thine enemies thy footstool.' Here we recognize the Father as the Eternai, and the Son as mj Lord. This question has been debated and examined in all its aspects throughour the nineteen centuries of the Christian era in such a way as to reconcile the bgher notion of the Holy Trinity with traditional monotheism; this Is due to the Fact that the Trinity is only expressly referred to in the New Testa- ment, yet it is the essential dogma of Christianity. In the course of its search for that reconciliation, Christian theology refers to the Hebrew plural EIobim amongst others, as well as the passage from Genesis which says: Behold, Ahm is bscoms ras one o,f w, to ~GW Good arPd Evil etc.\" An abundant literature dating from the first centuries has firmly estab- lished that the notion of the Trinity already exists in the Old Testament, although in disguised form, and that this notion, since it recognized in the Trinity a consubstantial and indivisible nature, did not conflict with either the idea or the practice of monotheism. On this point, we refer the reader who is more particularly interested in this question to specialist works.\" I t may be a matter of interest that the Divine Trinity is found in some pre-Christian reLigions, The Trinity of Hinduism: Brha, Vishnu and Shiva, is too well known to require comment. Less well known is that of the pre-Christian Slavic religion, which recognizes a Trinity that is purely consubstantial and indivisible. The one God, creator of the Universe and of man, is called Tri-Bog (= Tri-God) or Tri-GPm (= Tri-Head , and is represented in human form with three heads on a single body.' 1 God also is called Soarog, whose etymology has so far not been deter- mined. Some aspects of that supreme God of the rigorously monotheistic Slavic religion bring them nearer to the Christian concept.

Peter, whowas there with James and John, began to speak, saying to Jesus: 'Lord it is good for us to be here: if Thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, one for Moses and one for Elijah ... 'While he yet spakt, behoId a lumi~om clod overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud said, This is my beloved Son in whom I m well pleased; hear ye h.'17 This phenomenon of the clod is mentioned more than once in both Old and New Testaments. The testimony St Symeon the New Theologian left us of his personal experience contains a precious indication in the follow- ing passage from his work: '... I heard from a pricst-monk who mme to trust me that he had never proceeded with liturgiml acts without having seen the Holy Spirit, in the same way that he had sccn it when the Metropolitan had pronounced thc prayer of initiat5on over him and the sacred hok had been placed on his head.

So to darify our ideas of the Holy Trinity, the basis of all Christian belief, we propose the following interpretation: A - The real Father of the created Macrocosmo~ is God the unmanifest, who contains in unmanifested form the entire Holy Trinity. B -His absolute creative Love appears as the Holy Spirit, Omnipresent and All replenishing, All vivifying and Perfct. He is the Father of Christ, who was incarnated by Him and of the Virgin Mary ICE. the Creed. He is dso our own Father, as Jesus said more than once while exhorting humans: Beye thergore perfect tverr asjow heavenly Father irpefe~t.'~ In other words, He is the Absohte I, Head of the First cosmic Octave. C - The Son, the cosmic Christ, Jesus Christ incarnated amongst hu- mans, being One with his Father who is the Holy Spirit, from whom he is inseparable. Nevertheless, nobody can come to the Father except through the The organs for reception of divine Grace are our two higher centres: by the higher emotional Centre we come to identify ourselves with our real 'I', a monad of Christ; throggb this- and jn no other way - man establishes contact with his higher intellectual Centre, which allows him to receive the messages of our heavenly Father. Thus crossing the third Threshold, he enters rhe Pleroma of His absolute Love, the supreme Beatitude. The Son, as we have said already, is the Absolrrte II, Head of the Second cosmic octave. I n strictly canonical form, this is the way in which the image of the Holy Trinity appears in its three Hypostases which are consubstantial and indivisible; the Trinity that is One, TriBog, the TriGod of the Slavs, the Creator and only Master of the Universe - the Macrocosmos. We must add two further points to the preceding. First, we want to dissipate any doubt which may arise in the reader's mind if he thinks we are making an innovation in dogma. Certainly not. We have already said in the 18. Saht Sjmron tbc New Theoiogiian, S~armoa~, Trans rated from the Greek by Bishop Thaophan the Recluse in 2 vok. Moscow, C.

It cannot be doubted that in the esoteric theogony of primitive Chris- tianity this notion of God the Father became part of the definition of the Holy Trinity, which later became dogmatic without always including the precise details on which it was based and which have been described above. Yet it would be absurd to suppose that this reality could have passed unnoticed or have been neglected by the Apostles and rheir disciples. But this subtle notion, like so many others which had no practical reli- gious application in that era, remained hermetized until the time was opportune for its unveiling. The second point towhich we wish to draw attention is the famous XIth century controversy whch led to the Great Schism between the Western and Eastern Churches. The genesis of that unhappy split generated by His Church in the earthly Body of Christ goes back to the beginning of the TXth century. Political considerations then dominated the controversy. But the East, which does not admit the evolution of Dogma, clung to the formula of the Apostles Creed just as it had been consecrated in the seven czcumenical Councils. These are the only Councils recognized in Orthodox Trahtion, while the Roman Tradition counts thirteen more Councils. According to the definition we have proposed, it is certainly easier to admit that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father, which is the Ortho- dox dogma, than to assume that He cams from the Fathm and the Son (the 'filioque'), which is the Roman Catholic dogma adopted at Emperor Charlemagne's initiative at the beginning of the IXth century, during the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle and then at Frankfurt. And if we refer to St John the Apostle we find a formal indication that the Holy Spirit comes from the ath her.^^ W e should not be astonished that when it talks of God the Father, the Apostle$ Creed does not explicitly describe the Absolute in His pre- Creative state that preceded Creation. Nevertheless, the formula: Omi- potent, Creator of heaven and earth and of ail tht iis visible and iwisibie covers 21. Volume I, p. 70 K. 22.

We did this starting from the idea of the unmanifest God as the uncontested Father of manifestation, '. . . one God almkhty, Creator ofbeam and earth and of all fb~t is visible and inftiskb~e\" 25 He contains in Himself, in the state of ere-creation, as already said, the whole Holy Trinity in an unmanifested state. By its manifestation the Holy Trinity takes on the aprance of the three canonical Hyportarcr, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Symbolically we attribute the term AbsoIirte 0 to God the Father. At the same time, in the system we are )tt4Mow revealing, we recognize the Holy Trinity in the following taken together: Absohte 0; Abmlgte I; and Ab~ohte II. The symbolic attribution of the number 0 to God the Father has a real meaning, Let us remember the well known traditional maxim: Eveything tomes from Zero fa redffr# to if at the end. We should note that ths sentence is not a simple image. Zero is not in fact Emptiness; it occupies a ddnite place among the numbers, and it possesses dearly defined properties. Therefore, from attentive examination of the series: 23. Mark jv: 11. 24. Cf. John xi: 25. 25. The first anicle of the Apo~th Cwd according to the Siavonic text.

W e now come to the most sensitive point: to the interpretation of the entity which is the Absolute m. Firstly, we should note that the number three attributed to him in the system of three cosmic octaves is only his ordinal number. The symbolic number which is truly his own is not three but FOUR. That traditional attribution is based on several reasons and has several meanings. The position he occupies in the system described above not only implies that he presides over the application of the L,aw of Three in the frame of the Law of Sevet~ - with the purpose of the procreation of the species of organic Ive on Earth as created by God - but he also ensures the continuity of the autonomous manifestations of life: plants, animals and humans. Thus the Absolute Ill is responsible for maintaining the procreation, ly themselves and in the order defined by the Creator, of those elements whose species, in course of time and according to the needs of the times, undergo certain modifications realized by the Absolute JI according to principles established by the Absolute 1. With this reservation we shall understand the importance of the role of the Absolute 111 as Master of the third octave which we have defined as the keystone of the whole system. The number FOUR, symbol of the Absolute III, also signiiies that he himself is the fruit of creation, as axe all the specjes whch reproduce under his segis. I n the system of three cosmic octaves of this Tradition, the number THREE is attributed to the feminine principle of Creation. It symbo- lizes the will of the je~b.\"' This wifi ofthefaesh, referred to by St John the Apostle on the human plane, is spread across all three cosrnic octaves and throughout the Mnerocosmor.

But while we do not find any precise or symbolic references in the Tradition for the origin of theQ~een of the H~avms-except for an image of the 'Reflection in the waters'- for the Absolute ITI the indications are clear: He is Sathanael, first begotten at the hghest level of the Atchirtrategi, the immutable entities. He emerges as Satan, in Hebrew simply 'the thwar- tet' ('en traver.?), the adversary or enemy. We shall return to that Absolute shoaly so as to identify his name and his titles as they appear in the Gospel and in the Tradition. hile the three hypostases of the Holy Trinity, together with the WQ wen of the Hecnven~-, embrace the whole Macrocosmor, the A bsalu te IT1 only presides over the birth of the outer layer of the Universe. Tn our Rq Creatim- as we have seen- he is the Regent of orgcnic ife on Earth within the limits of the mental and physical fife of the three kingdoms of nature: flora, fauna and man. He dominates them by the action of sexual energy in the four phases of life: conception, birth, gro& and finally reproduction. This sexual energy is rhe dynamic expression of his love, which is carnal Love, while the spiritual life, which is accessible to man through the mediation of his higher centres, remains outside the sphere of the Absolute Ill. His task is thus limited and he carries it out, as we sdd, by the sexual Love which emanates from him, by the force of attraction between the sexes, and by Illusion, 'the dreams of the sleeping young Serpent'. The current of his Love acts like a drug on both man and woman and, in its different forms, keeps them in a hypnotic state from puberty to the end of their days. A lthough he may believe that he is 'awake' and 'objective' {re'alistt exterior man lives in an Illusion that is inseparable from the influent by which his sexual centre governs his Personality. When not fulmng i primary function, the call of love by the Absolute III takes many differel forms, differing in appearance and sometimes very different from or eve contrary to what can be dehed in current language as sexuality. Examples art exaggerated ambition, conceit, intransigence, a domineering attitude, vrsnny, and an exaggerated possessiveness, especially towards another person, when it may include jealousy. We can also add to this list incre- dulity, susceptibiliry, and a policemanlike attitude applied to private life. Illusion, fuelled in man by sexual attractjon or by its many mental derivatives, is the source from which the Generat Lw draws its power, the Absolute IXI being responsible for its application. The absolute power of Illusion ends at the boundaries of the Mixfirs Orbis, outside which the 'A' influences no longer rule. Yet as long as they identify themselves with their Personality, the creatures of organic life on Earth: flora, fauna and humans, are all subject to the incontestable and uncontested empire of carnaI Love and the Great Illusion, Mq, which everyone takes for Reality. For flora and fauna-on their own planes of relativity-Mqa represents the Truth, since 'B' influences are inaccessible to them, but man has a choice. By his choice he determines his atritude towards the Absolute III, as well as that of the Absolute I11 towards him. The love of the Absolute IX is favourable, agreeable and beneficial for anyone who is not interested in 'By Muences, and who does not burn with the desire for liberation. Within the limits of \"ourgeois happiness', it even contri- butes to man's success, On the other hand, for one who has tasted 'B' influences, who is crossing or who has already crossed the first Threshold to start climbing the Jkdder, the influence of the Absolute ITI becomes harmful and he must fight it by all means and on all planes, Yet according to Iegend, the Absolute I11 is simply carrylng out an assigned mission in which he takes the role of the Devil, and he feels sad when a Knight of Christ, entering the path, does not offer enough resistance to emerge victorious from this itwisible Co~~bat. I n the Gospel, Jesus gives the name of the Prime of this world to the Absolute In. This is the common name far this entity, and embraces all his functions, beneficial and harmful. It is specifically in carrying out the latter that he bears the name of Satan, that is, rhe memy or ladversarp. of man.

The second scale is shortened and includes only eleven Hydrogens instead of the twelve in the first. The scale of substances of Third cosmic Octme begins from Hydrogen 6, symbol of the perpetual rebirth, which corresponds to H 24 on the first scale and to H 12 on the second. For reasons anaIogous to those which led to the shortening of the second scale, the third is still shorter: the first two qualities of Hydrogens are missing from it.

In this way they balance one another, one moving from the fine toward the coarse and the orher from the coarse toward the fine. The whole possibility for the esoteric evolution of man lies in the in- tegration of the latter movement. The other runs automatically. Beginning from a certain stage which depends on the person, the trnnsmucatiosl of elements from the coarser plane towards che fine demands conscious efforts, or sometimes even superefforts; the reverse movement, as we said, will automatically follow the first without any effort. We find an analogous process in the opposite direction in the action of the psycho- logical part of the gamut which ensures physical conception. We should not assume that this equilibrated double movement is gen- erated in each case and in each direction by a single process. It acts in the ma directions through a bandle of parallel processes. In an immature man, this bundle is thin Z&ough very firm: to the degree that the Personality grows and develops this bundle becomes complicated and gains in subtlety. In exterior man, as long as his Personality remains in- completely developed and is still disequilibrated, this bundle is stricken with a weakness that is inversely proportional so that at the end it aPIows him to understand everything but gives him no power. After the second Threshold, following the birth of the Individ~li~, the equilibrated double bundle forms a complete instrument of a sensitivity and power incompar- able to those the exterior man cm enjoy.

Each of these can be distifl pished from the other Hydrogens by the specific character of its chemical, physicaI, psychological and cosmic properties, all of which are of the same functio~l order alrhough they wt on very different plants. Among other things this remark explains why it is impossible to estab- lish precise equivalences between the Table cfHydrogen.s and Mendeleyev's periodic Table of chemid elments, which only considers the physico-diemi- a1 properties of matter. But current research into the structure of the atom is bringing our positive science ever nearer to traditional knowledge, so that today we can observe a convergence rending to reconcile the two disciplines on that particular point of Knowledge. The same can be said of a fine part of the scale of Hydrogens which had evaded direct scientific observation until now, that which constitutes the matter-energy of the life of our psyche. In that domain too, evolution can be observed. Thus it is now possible to envisage that physics, biology and medicine, as they continue to move forward in their researches, are approaching a limit beyond which the hnest Hydrogens - H 12 and even H 6 - will be detected, so that they will then gain the right of recognition in those branches of positive sciene."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI (1) W hen we think of the Universe as a living Being, composed of living matter and filled with Pivjng organisms, we face the question of its ntdrition.

N OW let US see how the transmutation of Hydrogens occurs in our organism, starting from the food introduced through the mouth -which is composed of H 768. This transmutation follows an ascending octave that starts from DO 768, which represents a vast group, the complete series of elements which form our nourishment in the form of different foods. This DO is passive, Starting from this, the transmutation follows a complete octave in our organism. Yet it does not develop spontaneously, We already know that if it is to continue without interruption, the development of a process along a gamut requires two complementary shocks to fill the intervals which, in the case of an ascending gamut, are placed so that one lies between MI and FA and the other between SL and DO. As far as we art concerned, the food H 768 introduced into the mouth as DO 768, is then regarded as oxygen, that is to say, as apassive force. In our organism it is subject to the action of an active force, carbon, of density C 192. During the complex processes which occur at that point, the ne~tralixing force, nitrogen N 284, emerges. According to the Law of Three this appears in our organism as Hydrogen RE 384. Transmutation proceeds in an analogous way in the following stage, where RE 384 gives birth to MI 192. To be precise, let us repeat that the ascenhng gamut of the transmuta- tion of energies drawn from food-like any evolving gamut -is balanced by anorher gamut, this a descending one that corresponds to the formation of metabolic wastes. This selective (triage) process is carried out at each note. What first interests us are the energies that the organism can draw by transmutation of the elements from foods when they are treated progres- sively at each note of the ascenhg gamut. Hydrogen MI 192 is already a relatively refined energy. Yet like the previous notes it first appears as apassive force. To avoid a misunderstanding which always occurs at this point of our study, we will once again warn that we must nor confuse the vehicle of an energy with the energy itself. As a passivf force, MI 192 does not encounter an active force in the organism to activate it, as happens to DO 768 and RE 384. So when it reaches the interval that separates MI from the FA of this gamut, the process of transmutation must stop. If it is to continue to progress, the naturally passive MI 292 must receive a complementary shock."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"This shock is supplied by the breath. Air penetrates into the lungs as DO 192-actitre. mere it comes into direct contact with the MI 192, activating it by imparting part of its energy to it. Thus it fills the interval and allows the process of transmutation to reach the note FA 96. By this transmutation, therefore, we reach H 36, the first of the sub- stances which evade physico-chemical analysis at the present state of science. In fact, FA 96 is the first of a series of four substances considered by positive science to be undetectable. But their presence is felt. Common Ianguage testifies to this: when the note FA 96 resonates strongly and dearly, we say somebody 'radiates health'. This is referred to as animal magnetism. Once we have accumulated substantial reserves of that energy within ourselves we will remain strong, with good humour and cheerfulness towards others. From these statemenzs we can draw the first important lesson concern- ing our nutrition. Whatever may be our type, our temperament, our state of health, the accumulation of energy FA 96 wdl always be highly ben- eficial to us. Within the limits possible from the esoteric point of view, it will allow us to put into practice the maxim: Mmx sam in torpore sm. The strong and clear resonance of FA 96 remains the indispensable basis for developing the life of the psyche and the moral life under the best possible conditions. A fter FA 96 there is no interval to be filled before we can pass to SOL 48; neither is there one between SOL 48 and LA 24, nor between LA 24 and SI 12. This last energy, SL 12, is produced in great quantities within us provided that our food follows the principles of a healthy diet and is rich in nurritive substances without being over-abundant. Excess delays transmutation, especially at the level of LA 24, and brings on disorders of very different types, obesity being one of them. For this process to pass through the development ofthegamut easily and fully, the food must meet psychological criteria which make it attractive; from the material paint of view, it must be balanced in its composition, prepared with care, and presented in a logical way. The planning of the 'menu' should reflect a gamut which corresponds to the physiological stages of digestion. An these requirements are most often neglected. Deep and strong respiration is the second indispensable condition for abundanr production of a satisfactory quality of FA 96. This necessity is the reason for breathing exercises which, when well: conducted, can double the effectiveness of the instinctive reflex of respiration, although they are full of dangers when practiced without the advice of an experienced person. Now we will examine the significance of each note of the first food octave in a more detailed way: DO 768 corresponds to the pleasures of the table, the delicacy of the ingredients, to the way the meal is prepared; these latter factors predispose aur organism to assimilate the food in the best condtions; in addition, ths DO corresponds to the transformation and even to the direct absorption of foods through the mouth (sublingual absorption). RE 384 corresponds to the absorption of energies during digestion in the digestive tract. MI 192 corresponds to the Jevel of the heart. FA 96-3s we have already said-is 'animal magnetism'. It results from oxidization of venous blood. The blood which leaves the lungs must be brilliant red because of perfect oxygenation. One's blood mnilsf be onjm, says the Trahtion. SOL 48 is one of the energies normal to the lower intellectual centre. If the food is of bad qualiry, intellectual work suffers. This is the basis and mainstay of our capacity to think. We know that the first effect 05 lack of food is the weakening of the capacity for concentrating our thoughts on a determined object and of our ~bility to create ideas. LA 24 ensures the vigour of our organism. The latter's capacity for mwemenr at all levels, both interior and exterior, is ensured by the motor centre and depends primarily cm the quality of our food. We must there- fore insist again on the qualrty of food. There is an observable difference between meat and vegetarian diets; between hot and cold food etc. SI 12. The production of sexual energy in 51 12 crowns the evolution of this gamut. The energy SI 12 is polyvalent, that Is to say that it can be utilized in three different modes. The first is what one might call its basic or natural use. SI 12 energy serves as food for the sexual centre, is meant for the sexual acr, and through this it ensures the reproduction of the species."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"This reproduction begins from DO 6, and folZaws a descending gamut as explained where Chapter Vm describes the nature and role of the Abso- lute III in the Third cosmic octave. However, the passage from Sl 12 to DO 6 runs up against the second interval. This is predsely filled by the notes SI, LA, SOL and FA of the Third cosmic octave. As we have already seen, these notes in their en- semble form the neutralizing force which, ifp jne, provides the link between the active masculine SI 12 and the passive, feminine SI 12. The other two uses of the energies of SI 12 are very different. Yet those two represent an internal consumption of that energy irrespective of whether the organism is masculine or feminine. One is unnatural. Usurped by the motor eenrre, SI 12 serves as the 'fuel' that feeds the negative parts of the lower emotional and intellectual centres and forms negative emotions. This question is treated in detail in the third part ofthis volume. There we will describe methods by which it is possible to struggle against such tendencies and even draw a profit from them. Let us repeat that this use, which is now very common among humans, is not only against nature but is particularly harmful; in effect it destroys the organism of the psyche and through that of the body. The ather use of SI 12 energy is equally unnatural or rather 'against nature\" But it differs profoundly from the preceding one. While the con- sumption of SI 12 by negative emotions was mechanical, in the latter case its use is the result of conscious and sustained efforts. The theory of this mode of use of SL 12 is that instead of ejecting this energy outside the organism during the sexual act the exterior man should store it to accelerate the formation of the astral body, that is, for the growth and development of his under-developed Personality. Several methods exist for using SI 12 energy for that purpose. All of them lead to a recognizable acceleration of the esoteric development of Personality. In general they involve sexual abstinence accompanied by emotional and intellectual concentration. At the same time, during the whole operation and each time it is undertaken, the motor centre is kept occupied in an appropriate way so as to avoid its interference in the process, interference by which that centre tends to usurp SI 12 energy and channel it towards orgasm. This, by the way, is the method generally used in monastic practice. The development of the gamut of respiration - the second octave of nutrition- starts in the lungs with contact berween DO 192 and the MI 192 to which it communicates part of its wtive energy. From there, by a process andogous to that which we observed at the beginning of the first octave, DO 192 passes without hindrance to RE 96, then to MI 48, where evolution of the gamut runs into the interval. In most of mankind, the transmutation of the elemenrs stops there: for nature itself does not provide a compIementaty shock, as in the case offirst octave. Yet this shock can he introduced in a way analogous to the pre- ceding example; although no longer rnechanicalIy but by conscious effort. h Under certain conditions, the nature of which we shall describe, when the DO of the third octave of nutrition, impressions, is activated, it can communicate part of its energy to MI 48, whch is of passive nature. This will allow the latter to fill the interval and to pass to FA 24 following the same system of transmutations. At the same time, if the contribution of complementary energy is suffi- cient, the FA 24 passes withour hindrance to SOL 12 and, even From there to LA 6. Transmutation along that octave stops there in dl cases. I IV T he third octave-impressions-begins with DO 48. This DO 48 is the totality of all the impressions which penetrate us from the exterior through our senses, and all those which arise from within us as a mechan- ical reaction to internal or external impressions - either in a direct line or transformed by associations. This DO 48 is passive. As we have said, it msures the continued ex- istence of the organism, and the transmission of all the different signals the motor centre sends to the inteUectua1 and emotional centres. We register the impressions which reach us passively in the way just described. DO 48 is also the mrlferidof thought, which is elaborated by means of a basic element provided by the first oaave of nutrition in the form af the energy MI 48. However, thought of the order of DO 48 is limited to the mechanics of forma1 logic, and it cannot transcend what philosophy knows as pwe remon. This situation changes in a radical way if we apply the light conscious effort to this DO 48, that of tofi~tating the received impressions. The effort of constatation described at length in the first volume of ths work, if it is not applied after the event but at the instant when the impression is received, communicates an active quality to the DO 48. In this event he DO 48 communicates part of its energy to the naturally passive MI 48 in the octave of respiration and, as already mentioned, this ensures that 'he transmutation of Hydrogens is continued right along the octave of respiration."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Applied to of our proper impressions at the exact moment that they are received, this effort of conscious constatation dso allows a certain devel- opment of the process of transmutation along the third octave. The lazter then passes from DO 48 to RE 24 and so to MI 12, where it in turn runs into the intervat. As in the case of DO 48, this interval too can be filled by a conscions effort, but this effort will be of a higher order and will demand the simul- taneous application of several elements. We will find more than one allusion to this second and complementary conscious effort in specialized literature; yet knowingly or unknowingIy- we cannot determine which - this key question is aIways treated in an incomplete way. The indications given, although never dangerous, remain unusable. In reality, several conditions must be brought together beforehand dur- ing appropriate exercises completed in advance, to crmte, at the precise place in the organism and at the most opportune moment, three united forces - C, 0 and N - of the specific quality and of sufficient power necessary to give birth to an active H 12 capable of making MI 12 cross over to FA 6. This operation - as we can well imagine -requires a complete special training that acts equally on the three octaves of nutrition: training in he canstasation of certain exterior and interior impressions; training in breathing and finally, training in the laferal transmutation of SI 12 into SOL 12. We shall analysc the practical appbcation of that process in a more detailed way in the next volume, when we examine the physical and mental conditions of esoteric work as carried out in the world outside monastic life. B elow we show the complete food diagram of the human organism, with its three octaves of the transmutation of absorbed Hydrogens: the foods of digestion, respiration, and impressions. By meditating on this diagram, the atrentive reader will be able to draw on his own experience to complete the descriptions given in the present chapter. FIG. 10 I To conclude, for all individuals who try through practice to improve the way their organism transmutes the Hydrogens from these three foods, we should like to point out that they should always keep in their minds the fact that lack of success in these exmcises is habitually related to two general causes: the first is impatience and haste; the second is ignoring the need to maintain equilibrium between these coupled gamuts. Power introduced in a particuIar direction at any point in a cycle must be compensated in the opposite direction by a contribution to the cycle that forms the other I dement of the couple,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI1 I n the Preface to the second part ofthis volume we said that, now that the era of Holy Spirit is rapidly approaching, everything must be brought to ' light. Everything, scientific secrets as wdl =a the deepest esoteric Knml- edge whose complete Revdation has been promised. This will reveal all rhc deviations of man's fundarnentdIy enquiring spirit, eager to fill the gaps of his KmvIedge at any price. Tbis desire is stronger than himself and I leads him to seek solutions for major cosmic and human problems when he only possesses a tiny part of the data that would solve them. As a result, his &orts are often marked by errors of conception that sometimes reach the point of heresy. He nevertheless continues to build his mental houses of cards when these problems cannot even be ap- proached without Revelation. IEhe constates the inanity of his propositions he then resorts to collective thought and calls on public opinion, seeking a majority in all manner of assemblies and councils as a way of resolving obscure or sensitive questions. But is not Voxjop~Ii Vox Dei? Yet the time is near when everything-including all the errors, heresies and lies -must be recognized and corrected. It will be obvious to the reader that ignorance of the system of the Three I cosmic Ocfavfs has been the root of our failure to find a valid solution to the great questions of life which have always disturbed the human mind that hungers for higher Knowledge-and which continue to trouble it today. It is only at the present stage af Revelation, on the basis of the data now I avaiIable, that we can consider these questions of life without rhe risk of being overwhelmed in the attempt because we lack sufficient means. Central to all the great unanswerable questions since the earliest times has been that of Evil. Without any knowledge of the General Law, of its meaning and its organic necessity, it is impossible to solve that problem or to decipher \"he symbolism of Genesis which is its key. So let us attack the question by a still more attentive examination of the Biblical symbols. We do not generally take account of the fundamental fact that the Tree of Kff~~ed~e of God and ~pilis one single tree whch bears both kinds of fruit at the same time-so that they neutrdize tach other. Still more paradoxical the fact that the branches beating these fruits that have opposite tastes"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"stem from the same trunk, are nourished by the same sap, and this trunk grows from a common root. In real esoteric symbolism all these details are 1 significant. We do not generally ponder the fact that according to Genesis the Tree oflife grows in the same Garden of Eden-and thus nor far from the Tee ofKnwledge of Goodand Evil. The two trees plunge their roots into the same soil, drawing on the same waters and the same earthly food. The system of the Three cosmic Octaves reveat the deepest meaning of these symbols. Yet some might argue that if, in the Biblical account, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil can be regarded as a symbolic expression of the Third cosmir Octave, and the Tree of Lye as a representation of the Serond, why is there no symbol of the First cosmic Ortme, since Genesis does not speak of a third Tree? In researching this analogy, the reader must concentrate his attention on the system of Three cosmic Octaves. He will then constate that if the Third and Second octaves are born respectiveIy from the Second and the First, the latter cannot emanate from a preceding octave since it does not exisr. According to the rules of esoteric symbolism, since is originates from itself it could not be represented by a third Tree, that is to say, by a subordinate existence. So we find it symbolicalIy expressed in Genesis as the very soil of the Paradise that God planted in the ~ast.\" C ontinuing to study the symbolic meaning of this story in terms of the system of Three comic Octavev, we can consider the question of Evil in the context of the whole structure of the Universe. It will then become clear that, on a cosmic scale, absolute Evil does not exisr. The relative Evil that we observe and in which we are both artisans and victims, as well as suffering, sadness, sickness and death, are direct results of originat sin. This is original not only in the historic and academic sense, but above all because it Is repeated and lived out by each one of us from the moment in infancy when the 'I' of our Personality wakes to consciousness. In each one of us, man's identification with his under- developed Personality is a complete recapitulation-on a purely persond contemporary basis - of Adam's falL This identification is a major error. Yet if we get to the root of the problem we will constate that this error is willingly accepted by us. From this point on, the real 'Ip, when we finally accept the idea of its existence, appears to us as \"another', as a being different from ourseIves, 'Another\" whom we fear, and towards whom we take a defensive attitude if not actually hostile. 1. Genesis ii: 8. Even when we finally and definitely admit his existence within us, at least theoreticdy, and when we begin to understand the technique of Salvation, we do not in general feel any natural attraction towards this 'I' even though it is our own self. In most cases, having reached this point we will hesitate to renounce our habitual identification which muddles our Personality with the consciousness of our body. This is the sense of so-called reality that, inspired by the 'I' of the body, uses fear, hunger and sex as the great motivators that express themselves through an infmity of masks to distract our Personality from the 'I' that is truly real. In this situation, the Person- ality finds that fhe old wins ir bed. To get out of this zone of hypnosis we must begin an Itwi~ible Combat against the hold of the Generralkw which, using Illusion and the common idea of what may be considered as 'evidence', dissuades us from going any further towards crossing the first Threshold, and instead invites us to return to the things we know and to again assume our responsibilities as active members of human society. As a general rule, the Prince of this World does not act brutally. Mephistopheles rather prefers to put forward arguments, to give his advice, to obtain a decision by the seeker to abandon the path and return to a reasonable and normal 'life' as his own preference ... Truly it is difficult to begin this Invisible Combat. It not only opposes the disciple of esotericism to everything and everyone, but above dl it sets him against himself, against his own Personality. This enterprise is certainly difficult, yet it is always possible, For this is submission to the will of God, a will which stretches out a helping hand from our own depths. This explains the sadness of Mephistopheles when he is faced with human weakness, when we do not know how to oppose his counsels with firm resistance ... And when, deliberately using his arguments as if they were our om, we give him our talents of pure gold in exchange for his false coin. T here is nowaste in the economy of the cosmos. The Great Universe is organized on the principle of full utilization and fdlemlpyment. Evil, suffering, negative emotions and Death are utilized as a kind of 'manure' on the lower planes of growth or existence. Yet as it emanates from the working of the Thes msmic Octaves the range of Evil and its derivatives is limited. It is exactly defined by the boundaries of the Third cosmir Octave, and by the extent of the responsibility of the Absolute m, the Prince of this World, overseer of the Mixtxx Orbis and of organic Ife Earth within the limits of the \"A' influences. From this point ofview we can say that the meaning of all esoteric work, the very meaning of Salvation, of the call made by John the Baptist and the"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"teaching of Jesus and his apostles, is to recognize the relative and sub- ordinate value of 'A' influences, and to recognize the 'Ba influences as the only red value, since they are the imperishable sources of permanence and of Salvation. When the disciple finally realizes his identification with the real 'I', this will turn his whole scde of values upside down progress~vefy all along the Staircase, and completely with the second birth. The great Doctors of the oxurnmica1 Church say this I Ewe ponder it deeply, we may perceive a new meaning in the phrase 'thg glor15 God their death', which in Orthodox literature is currently applied to the torture and execution of certain martyrs, starting with the Apostles. The underlying meaning of that strange expression is much more than a simple recognition of the courage with which they faced death in the name of their Faith, St Symeon said that, havin cam p letel ybroken his identification with his Personality and, @so facto, wrth the '1' of his body - a fact which becomes intelligible in the light of what we explained previously-man bears misfortunes, pain, death, and even martyrdom as if these events were not happening to hime4 So glorification does not consist of courage shown at the time of martyr- dom, but in the victory in God's favour that man wins over himself during this very life. The Second Birth progressively brings to man a power which finally becomes absolute, first over hs Personality, then over his body. For twice- born man the body only has the value of an instrument of expression and action, an instrument that he abandons at will, which he can repair, and whose use he can prolong at wd. His death, whch will only occur by his consent, will no longer result in any suffering for him, and this is even true of martyrdom or crucifixion. This is the true meaning of theglor+%atiojon of God; it marks the victory of man wer himself, inspired and awaited by Christ. 2, Cf. amongst others, Symeon the New Theologian, Scrmor, op. at., volume 11, pp. 544 and ~Iscwhere. Cf. also, the death of Socrates in Plato. 3. That king sa. 4. Thc familiar phrase, 'unmoved by it, as if it were happening to someone dse' translates this idea better than the more exact rendering given. @d.) But we should not eondude that the passion and death of Jesus on the cross were of that: kind. The Son of God, incarnated on Earth as the Son of Man, appearing here below as Adam before the full, the perfect Man, without blemish and with all his powers, Jesus accepted suffering and death willingly and substantially, as if he were a common sinner like the rest of us who crucify Christ daily in our hearts. So great was that sacrifice - a subsfifation formda, as we said elsewhere - that it allowed humanity to subsist and so pass on, for good or ill, from the Crcle ofth Fafber to the Cycle cf the Son, and to do so if not in joy, at least in suffering. W e are now led logidly to consider another fmdamental problem, that of sin. We have already broadly defined it in the first volume of this work. Original sin should be envisaged as an error of conception, to which man has given assent, which distorts his underlying consciousness of'l'. Every- thing else follows logically fxom this. This is why we refuse to recognize that sin has any substantial significance. Sin is only the expression of an error of conception translated into action, that is to say, of an entirely false attitude to the problems or questions which, in general or in particular, rise before us daily. This is a subject where we often confuse cause and effect.. Sin is simply the effect of a causal attitude which necessarily leads to deviation and straying with all their consequences. Thus the basis of sin is error. That is why sin can and must be redeemed. The way of redemption is simple, but how difficult it is to put into practice! The method is repmtrsnce. To repent is to become conscious of the error which led to the act of sin. The Tradition says 'there is no wforgivabb sitr except sin witkout repenb~nte.~ It is important to thoroughly grasp the meaning of what we have just explained, It is not sufficient to balance the ~ct of sin by means of a diamttrica21y opposed aft, whose effect cancels the karmic tare but cannot wipe out the sin.6 To wipe it out, the opposed act must not simply be the result of a consideration emanating from the intellectual or motor centre. 5. Cf. Volume I. pp. 133-1 34. 6. As thc restitution of an amount stoten dll docs not cpnd the offence committed."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Repenrance, as we have said, is to become conscjous on the plane of the real 'I'; in other words, true repentance always has an emotional character. The traditional maxim for wiping out sin applies to every case except that quoted by Jesus: 'the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit'. This is understandable. Since the Holy Spirit is the essence of Conscious- ness, He is the last instance to whom the penitent an resort for repentance. But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit denies the very existence of Consciousness, of the Moly Spirit, and from that he falls into what the scriptures call oirrer darhess. This is why it has been said: Allmannsr of sin and blgqbemj shallbe forgiueti rmto men; bs/r blaphemy qaimt the Hob Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men.

It is an eternd sin.8 W e have already mentioned the pre-Christian xeIigion of the Slavs. We will return to it to explain how they expressed the doctrine of Evil in their theogony. The idea of Evil was conceived by them not in the abstract but in concrete and empirical form. Not finding a place for Evil in a providential theogony, yet seeing Evil act in life side by side with the Good, the Slavs recognized its divine origin and nature and personified it with the name of Tckarnobog (the black God). It is curious to see haw the Slavs reconciled this notion of Tcberndogwith that of an omnipotent and good God who was the Creator and the one absolute Master of the ~niverse.~ 1n this thorny problem of the connection of Evil with God, they neither adopted the Iranian dualist conception, based on the equal power of Ormuzd and Ahriman, nor the Judaeo- Christian position, monistic in principle but somewhat lame, since it admits - as far as the origin of Evil is concerned - a deviation from the precepts of a God Who always tends towards the Good; in other words, it admits a transgression of the divine Will which after this fact appears somewhat limited. In fact, the name Satan - which comes to us 7. Matthew xii: 31-32. 8. Murk iii: 28. 9. Pmopius of &ares, Ds B41.b Gotrim, In, 14. from the Old Testament, signifies one who 'thwarts', the aduersrly, the eneay who is no longer Sathanael, the First begottm. Yet the Slavs attributed to Tcbemoboga field of action precisely limited to the domain placed under the authority of SvarogircR, the Son of God. They also said that the supreme Gd does not allow Evil nor recognize it. Since Evil in fact exists, Goddoesnot look at it anddoer not talk of it for, according to them, the direct radiation of the supreme God does not reach Earth. Thus, the statue placed in the temple of Stchetine (Stettin), with three heads on one body - symbolizing the supreme God called TrkIav (Tri- head), or Tribog {Tri-God) - had its eyes and mouths covered by bands of gold. According to the interpretation of the divines and priests, the bands of Tr;Slaft signified that the srrpreme God does not wilito see human hs, andpasses b_r them il~ ~iietwe a~ if He did mt how o/ thkr exiftern.' This conception certainly harmonizes well with the Slavs' initial pos- tulate, according to which the supreme God deals only with the celestial, and his direct radiation does not reach as far as the Earrh. Certainly traditional, this conception represents a remarkable attempt in the history of human thought to reconcile the principle of divine goodness with the presence of Evil in the world. T he ancient Slav religion, which was rigorously monotheist, is little known and has been little studied despite its interesting character. We can affirm that in more than one way it is nearer to Christianity than any orher ancient religion. Its theogony also knows a Son of God. Its concep- tion of Evil, Tchernobog, aIlows us to suppose that an esoteric Tradition existed with them at that time, and that it jnduded dements of Gnosis in one form or another -a knau-ledge of the system of Three cosmic Octmer- masked from the emerior world by images and symbols. M any minds, at the very heart of Christianity but tormented by the problem of Evil, evidently had a presentiment of the presence and power of the AbsoIute IIT. Having no correct idea about his origin or his mission, nor of the limits to his authority, they went as far as to speculate that the world had been created by the Deuil, We have already alluded to these theses, a variant of which taught that, if the world had been created by a God, that God, if not wicked, was at least limited in his power or even incompetent. 10. Ebbo, 64; Helmold, Lib. 1,pasrim."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"This was the origin of numerous heresies during the first centuriesof our era, an echo of which we find again in the Midde Ages. The degree of Revelation by that epoch did not allow the elements making it possible to solve that problem to be brought together: in particular, knowledge of the system of Three cosmic Octaves was lacking. A dangerous imagination filled the gaps. T he compIete disclosure of the system of the Three cosmic Ocfsrves also allows us to deal with an important question whose meaning has always remained obscure: that of Initiation.

The works of rhe most erudite authors only give us an approx- imate view of them; they talk of the role that the mysteries played in the pubIic and private life of the ancient world; yet about the mysteries them- selves and their esoteric content, we are very badly informed. When ancient authors mentioned the mysteries in their works, they went no further. Some of them explained their silence by saying that an oath of absolute secrecy had been imposed on them during the initiation ceremony itseIf, A few pictures, monuments, myths, and fragments of certain cults, allow us to form the hypotheses that the essential content of the different mys- teries of antiquity included a common theme. The language of our Tradi- tion defines this as the Mystey of the Promi~e: that is, as a disdosurc throughout the ancient world, which was then in the middle of the Cycle ofthe Father, of the Redemption promised in the future Cjjcle, that of the Son.

It is clear that the raison d'Etre of the .My$dely c-ft'hf Promise, which was a mystery of Hope, was Realized and then disappeared with the realizatim of its hope. It is therefore useless to regret the disappearance of the andent mysteries whose esoteric content is super- seded by Christianity. Researches aiming at their restoration are now of merely academic interest. This is even more so since Christianity, at least in its original form, itself represents adisclosure thac brought into the light of day the truths and the techniques of work on oneself that had been taught in the Mystfly ofthe Promise, which then allowed the spiritual elite at the time of Christ's Advent to establish vanguard teams for the newborn Christianity by adapting to the facts of the Mysterjl of Reali~atioion. We can rhus understand without difficulty rhat during the history of Christianity the Mysteries no longer had the Promise as their theme, since this had already been realized by Jesus. The emphasis was now on the realization o~rselve~ and within odl~seives of the New Mm, the true Christian according to the modelgim .w Om Lord. We are now concerned not only with Faith and Hope as in the past, but in addition, as we have already stated several times, wish the true G~osis and true Love. 'These are given in a new initiation into the Mjstery ofAccomplishment which aims for a general Resurrection during the Cyci. cf the Hob Spirit.12 Because of this, ancient mysteries such as those of the old ~estanrent'~ are superseded.

This is the teaching in the Gnosis series, which provides minds enraptured by Gnosis and by Love with necessary and sufficient indications - by means of planned and effective work - to reach Initiation into the final mystery, the Accomplishment. We must pause here so define the meaning and effect of esoteric Initiation jn the proper sense of that term, The attentive reader of this book will have little need for this.

Out of the mysteries of antiquity came a New Man, capable of actively contributing to rhe coming of the Era of the Son. At a hgher level, the Mystep ofthe Accompli~bment will cause the emergence of New Men - and they are already ernerging- as the indispensable condition for the proper beginning of the Era of the Holy Spirit. Today we are somewhere in the time of transition to this new Era. The cuItivation of pure reason and practical reason were the objectives of the transformation of ancient man by means of initiation, as evidenced by the works of the great phiIosophers of the epoch. Today that step has been passed, and the objective of initiation now consists of establishing direct and certain contact with Divine inxpiration through the mediation of the real '1'. In both cases, although at different and successive levels, Initiation required and requires long and assiduous prepararory work from the seeker and an effective and profound modfication of his whole being whose aim is to transform his consciousness of his own 'I'. The Apostles of Jesus, and later the great doaots of the oecumenical Church, were certainly Initiates of the Mytery of the Atcomjli~hment, as were the saints of historical Christianity. Today a new elite of such Iniriube~ is being formed to assume responsibility for receiving and establishing the Era of the Holy Spirit on Eaah in the near future. This elite will be formed of twice born men, interior men, in other words of prophets and apostles, Ths should not surprise the reader. Even taken alone, the amazing progress of technology locks human society into a deadlock of power. It proves beyond doubt the powerlessness of the IntelIectual -who still holds the power - to organize life in conditions that are beyond his capacities, And true Peace, desired by everyone instead of a balance of Fear- eludes him. Only the New Men, with a higher level of conscious- ness, that of the real 'I' for the divine essence, can successfully face life's problems, which will become increasingly insoluble in today's conditions and will be able to put the new things in their new phces. A fter the explanation above it is unnecessasy to emphasize the fact that Initiation, in the esoteric meaning of the word, is not simply a 'ceremony'. The Initiation ceremony no longer occurs ns of old on the human plane and with human rituaIs - and this is understandable. The modern Initiate, forerunner of the citizen of the Cycle dfthe Hob Spirit, is liberated from obedimce to the Absolute III by the second Birth, and - like the prodigal son- he is then received into the Alliance of he of which Jesus is Firstborn and Head. Yet the ceremony still exists in modernInitiation, but it is conducted on the super-sensory plane. Nevertheless, it is real. It confirms the Initiate in a new dignity earned by his Work, and carries him towards the divine Grace whch keeps him under pressure from within his own depths. This Initiation ceremony docs not occur visibly on thematerial plane for a reason which is very clear: it is because with it the Initiate crosses over in spirit from the kingdom of this world to the Kingdom whch is not of this world. From then on he plays a part in the higher notes of the Second co~mic Octave, the Kingdom of Christ. W e have a few more words to say about the second definition of Initiation given above, whch referred to the admission ceremonies of different contemporary secret societies. We will leave the analysis of their esoteric value to specialists. The Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy knows no initiatory secret societies like those described, which are found in the West. Yet for some time now literature about them has been widespread, produced not onIy by their adversaries but by these societies themselves. We only wish to pu t remark on one point which has particularly held our attention. In everything disclosed about these traditions and rituals, the accent is always put not on the New but on the Old Testament, and within the latter not on the tradition that came from King David, but on that transmitted by his son, fing Solomon. The historical causes of this phenomenon could undoubtedly be estab- lished, but they are outside the scope of our work."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI11 I n esoteric science, the doctrine of the Thres cosmic Octaves plays a role anaIogous to that played by D.I.

Danilevsky's doctrine of the tiYili~ing historical grpes in his to rical science. In other words, the system of the Three cosmic Octaves allows the intro- ' duction of a #at& classification into Gnosis as an alternative to ordering facts and ideas artificidly and so at random, or at the whim of the author. This ensures that the essential condition for positive scientific study is fulfilled: thad the CYTTP'CIIIY~ shoilld sorsfspond to the sdrsrctm ofthe &)ct st~died. Danilevsky's doctrine-the essentials of which we are about to outline- is capable of transforming History by substituting a logical and orderly system for a mass of apparently incoherent facts. Only such a system will allow us ro grasp the true meaning of the historical process take as a whole, as well as of every branch of history, It then becomes possible to study isolated Historical phenomena in relation to the whole evolution of His- tory; in other words to consider the facts nor only in isolation but in their organic historical context. By putting things in their place, the system of Danilevsky, Pike those of Copernicus and Mendeleyev, automatically nullifies false rheories which so often persist in the present state of hstorial science and prevents the emergence ofthescs that have no relation to the general context of History. In the domain of History, as in Religion, the introduction of false the- ories is particularly dangerous; introduced into the consciousness of she masses by skilful adepts, these theories are capable of creating veritable epidemics of the psyche which lead to catastrophe. One example of this danger was the racist theory which, evolving from Gobineau to Hitler, became one of the principal motivating forces of the second world war.

Copernicus was also followed by great minds such as Gior- dano Bruno, who generalized his system, Johannes Kepler, who codified it and madeit more precise in terms of its three laws, and Isaac Newton, who completed it by the discovery of universal gravitation. But the historical theories of Danilevsky, a biologist to whom Russia owes its regulations controlling sea fishing, were not folIowed up by anyone, although his ideas are found here and there among modern authors such as Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee. Yet Danilevsky's doctrine offers a basis for logical classification and so opens the way to an understanding of historical phenomena, just as the systems of Copernicus and Mendeleyev opened up new visions in their respective domains. It is on this point that Danilevsky's doctrine is of interest to esoteric science. By placing it alongside our study of the Three cosmic Octaves, we will be better able to grasp the whole sweep of the evolution of terrestriaI humanity. Ths is of great interest to us as we face the rapid approach of the Era of the Holy Spirit during which, we reiterate, evcvthing muss be brought to light, not only to be grasped and registered but then to be &rrderstood. During this time of transition we are called on to abandon our chaotic, fragmentary and often blatantly fake pictures of the evolution of organic life oon Earth. Clear ideas about this arc indispensabie if we are ever to be able to orjent our conscious efforts towards the harmonization of the inner contents of the notes LA, SOL and FA of the Second cosmic Octave, which represent this organic lye. And as the planned evolution of the ensemble of those three notes depends directly on that of Humaniq as a whole, we must clarify this point from the beginning. Once thi! point is known, it will aIlow us to determine which direction this evolu, tion must take now, if it is to bring thenew Era and lead on to the genera Resurrection, its crowning. Thus the theme of the present chapter is to clarify the present position In the next chapter we will try to indicate practical ways of orienting ouj efforts in the direction 05 this goal we wish to attain. D afiilevsky published his doctrine about a century ago. There were six editions in twenty five years. Then the author was forgotten because nobody continued his work. Today, we are rediscovering DaniIevsky starts by constating that the classical way of subdividing history as a whole into periods: ancient, medieval, modern etc. is not natural, This is because different peoples do not evolve synchronously. The same epoch can be seen as early history for some, the middle ages of others, and the modern history of a third group. To be natural a system of historid classification should hrst group the peoples belonging to the same civilization, and only then should it study history within each group in terms of the different phases of their development. As a universal civilization does not exist, the usual subdivisions of n general history do not seem logical. Unless we distinguish clearly between the degrees of historical evolution on one hand, and the types participating in that evolution on the other, the natural classification ofhistorical phenomena is impossible. Danilevsky especidly says: 'The different forms of humanity's historical life, like rhe various forms of flora and fauna, Iike the forms of ~rt~ and languages: and like the manifestation of spirit itself, tend independently to create different var- ious types of the good, the true and the beautiful which cannot be looked at as if they all came from one another. These are modified and perfected with time, but they can also be distinguished by the different human types who carry the different civilizations. For that reason, it is only withn the limits of the same rype of culture, that is to say, within the framework of the same civilization: that it is possible to distinguish the stages of hstorical evolu- tion defined by these terms: ancient history, the history of the middle ages and contemporary or modern times. This last classification seems to be 2. Danifevsky N.

Ifwe examine any domain of life, we will find new elements everywhere: the Christian religion took on a papal character, and while the bishop of Rome already held the title of pope, the papacy as we know it was only established in that Germano-Roman era, and at that time it abandoned its original meaning; the relationship between the social classes was then completely changed, as society had adopted feudalism which was unknown in the ancient worldG; the manners, customs, clothes, the way of life, and public and private leisure activities were no longer those of Roman times. When the Western empire was restored three centuries after its fall, the new Roman emperor, although he appeared to resemble his predecessors, actually acquired an entirely new character, that of a feudal sovereign. The feudal beads of the new society owed allegiance to him in lay affairs just as they were obedient to the pope in religious affairs. Yet even this ideal was never realized after Charlemagne, and the German emperors, in spite of their pretensions, were only feudal monarchs Like any other-like the kings of France and England who soon exceeded them in power. Science adopted the scholastic form, which can never be considered as a continuation either of ancient philosophy or of the theological systems of the great doctors 05 the aecumenicnl Church; European science passed on after that to positive experimental methods that were most uncommon in the ancienr world. Most branches of Art, especially architecture, poetry and music, took on a totally different character from that of antiquity; painting in the Middle ages followed its own aims, distinguishing itself by its idealistic characrer and generally neglected the beauty of form too much. Only sculpture kept its imitative character and tried to follow the ancient ways, and this is probably why this branch of the Arts not only did not make any progress, but its productions proved inferior to those of its masters. Viewed from every angle, the elements of the Roman way of life had completed their cyde of development. Having produced all the results of which they were capable, they were finally exhausted so that nothing remained which could still be developed. The civilization that followed 6. Dadlevsky means by feudalism the form of govment arising from the conquest of one pplc by another, the conquerorsftom then on fotminga dngdassin the form of a hierarchic landowning aristocrlcy. was thus obliged to start not from the point where Rome had stopped - which in its own way had already reached the absolure limit-but to begin I anew in a direction that would allow evolution to continue. Nor is this new way without an end and the new step forward is fated to reach its own limit. It has always been thus, and it will always be the same. The people called on to found a new civilization must in their turn be well able to find a new start and step off in a new direction. Progress therefore does not consist in moying alwqs in fhe same direcfion, but in traperring the tvhoiejeld oftbe hisforicdaeti~ig of mankind in ever gossible dirtcfion. This is what has been happening in actual fact until the present time.' A t the time when Danilevsky wrote this work, people were still domi- nated by certain 'clichks' generally accepted by science. It was esti- mated, for instance, that the Chinese civilization, and to n great measure the Indian civilization, had fallen into a kind of coma, the outcome of which seemed to be fatal. Yet today not only China and India but the whole of the Orient is now on the road to renaissance and progressing on that road at an accelerating pace. The renaissance of she Orient was begun by the Reforms of Peter the Great in his own country, Russia, a century and a hdf before the publication of Danilevsky's doctrine. Under his direction, I Russia, foremost of the sleeping nations of the Orient, awoke and pointed the way to others. In the next century, Japan adopted and realized Peter's program on its awn soiI and far its own reasons. In the XXth. century the whole of the Orient gradually began moving in the same direction. The revolution of the Yowng Twh, started in 1908, culminated under Kamal Ataturk in the establishment oi a lay national State. In 191 1, the Chinese revolution succeeded before our eye; in establishing a central government in China that had real power - something unknown in that country for centuries. At the end of the two world wars, after the Russian revolution and the fall of the Hapsburg monarchy and the Ottoman empire, came the emancipation of the Slav countries from the Arab world. Then decolo- nization led to the independence of India, Indonesia, Indo-China ete. not to mention Morocco. The awakening of national consciousness has entire- ly changed the face of the Osiect. The situation, although different, is also recurring in depth in Africa. 7. Dnnilevskp, op. cit."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Danilevsky's system was based on an analysis of the sequence of the ages. I He says: 'Research into and chssification of the ciitildqing historica/~pes presents no difl+cuhy, as they are known to everyone. Yet people do not give them their rrue importance. Contrary to the rules of natural systems - and jn spite of good sense - they are subjected to a general subdivision that is rotally arbitrary and even irrational. Classified in chronological order, these ci- vilizing historical gpw, in other words, the original civilizations, are as folle~s:~ 1. - Egyptian 2. - Chinese 3. - Assyrio-Babylonian-E'hoenician, Chaldaean or ancient Semitic 4. - Indian I 5. - Iranian 6. - Hebraic 7. - Hellenic 8. - Roman 9. - Neo-Semitic or Arab 10. - Germano-roman or European. We can also add two Americm types to this list: the Mexican md the Peruvian, which disappeared without having had time to complete their development. Only the people who create these civilizations can be considered as constructive agents in the history of humanity. Each them has developed the original talent of its genius by leading its own life, under its own conditions, finally contributing it to the common cuIturd measure of humanity ... Yet the civifi~inghistoricul~~es that we have just designated as the positive agents of history cannot account for all phenomena of this kind. As we find in the solar system, besides the planets there are cornets that emerge only to lose themselves again for centuries in the abyss of space, and cosmic matter that manifests in the form of shoot- ing stars, aerolitcs and zodiacat light; it is the same in the h~rnan miverse, beside the civilizing, positive and originating agents, there are others who only intervene to bring trouble. This was the case with the Huns, the Mongols and the Turks. Having fulfilled their destructive role in relation to dying civilizations they returned to their primitive state where they were of little significance. We call them the fpqative ~g~nt~ of humanity. 8. The quotation mark8 at the end ofthis reference arc missing not only in the French text, bur also in the onIy translation which could have placed them correctly, that of Mme d'Ondeu who worked alongside M. Mouravieff. (Ed.) We must say right away that this has sometimes also been the role of the Germans and the Arabs. The same peoples can therefore pIay a construc- tive or a destructive role equally well. Lastly, there exist peoples .. . who ate neither given to greatness in construction nor greamess in destruction, who were not called on to play a historical role at the first level, either positive or negative. Those people provide ethnographic material, In other words, they participate in forming the organisms of the civiliqing historical 9pe1 as a non-organic element. Without doubt they enrich and augment the variety, but for themselves they do not reach the status of historical or cultural individuality. These include for exampIe certain Finnish tribes and a number of other elements of lesser importance. Conversely, we also see peoples among the civiliring bifforicai types who recede into this state and become ethnographical material when they are in a state of decomposition, waiting for a new formative principle to incor- porate them into a new civilizing type by mixing them with other ele- ments. This was the case of the people who had previously formed the Occidental empire.' Thus a single people can play out three different historical roles: the constructive role of the civilizing bi~torical gyper, the destructive role of the 'calamities of God' who bring down old and dying civilizations, or lastly, the role of a group thar contributes 'ethnographic material' to the aims of other peoples1o - and we may add, sometimes act as catdh~st. D anilevsky's system proceeds from an analysis of the succession of the ages, following whch he immediately rejects what he calls the ~kgle thread of the evolution of humanity. But it is possibIe to systematize the results he obtained by this analysis in a different order. It now seems more natural to first recognize the differing civiliqing hi~torilal opes which to- gether form todajtJs humanity, and after that to make parallel studfes of the history of each of these types according to Danilevsky's method. Taking the analogy he used, we shall envisage humanity it^ ids ensemble as composed of various civilizing types at various degrees of develop- ment, decadence, or lethargy, just as in the family of planets each foliIows its own orbit although forming a coherent whole and so constantly influ- encing each other, as well as the whole planetary world. Analogy is nor identity; but it will help us to grasp the genera1 meaning of the historical evolution of the different civilizing types, and we shall see by this that the 9. The Western Roman Empire (Ed.). 10. Danilevsky, op. clt."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"distinction made by Danilevsky between tradirional and imbted civiliza- tions (China and India) does not correspond to the facts. The life of one civilizing type is not made up of a single cycle reaching only one peak, as DaniIevsky believed, specifically referring to China. That life, like the rotation OF planets around the sun, can hclude many cycles which pass through successive periods of lethargy, renewal, fruitful ex- pansion and finally of decadence and slumber ... On the whole the evolu- tion of each civilization-forming type follows a kind of sine wave, repeating through successive phsses from one reflaissance after another. We should not lose sight of the fact that the nature of hummiry and its groups, classified in this way, does not belong to celestial mechanics but to terrestrial biology. That is why Danilevsky correctly predicted a fatal outcome for civilizations that prove incapable of renaissance. To apply this method the first field of study is as EolIows: for the whole of humanity on every part of the earth's surface, to identify the sources of all the original civilizations, whether in formation, fully fledged, in decline, in a stateof lethargy or even extinct. After this, we shall group tbe greater and lesser peoples belonging to each of these civilizations in order to study the history of each type that has been identified in this way, not only to examine its vicissitudes-as is normally done-bur also itspre~entage, its chances for a new renaissance in one cast, and the pace of its decline in another. In the analogy we have adopted, the civilization forming types would be similar to planets, given that the majority of the great planets of the solar system have one or more satellites while the small planets, whose number is considerable, have none. As an example - but. not exhaustive - we can give a list of the major originating types that exist today. 1. From the black race - one or several emerging from lethargy; 2. From the brown race - Mexican and Peruvian - making their first movement towards renaissance; 3. Arab 4. Chincst 5. Hebraic -at the start of their new renaissance; 6. Indian 7. Ethan 1 8.

North American- on the way to forming a new original civilizing type, ttc. One advantage of this kind of classification is that it allows us TO establish precise meanings for e~ltrre and civiii~ation, two different things which are often confused. By crrlture wc mean everything on the psychological and mord planes that belongs properly to all the members of one civilizing type. It is accepted that within this group each associated peaple is the carrier of a sgecifc culture. Between them they form the components of the cultural content of that civil@itg hi~farical gpe. This way of looking at it attributes its proper historical value to each people, greater or lesser, recognizing the irreplaceable character of its cultural genius. The conclusion from this is that moral progress necessarily depends on the cultural evolution of humanity. By civilixadion, we mean the ensemble of results obtained by the progress of technology, taking that notion in its widest sense. It fo'ollows from the above that the unique elements of a culture always remain nationaI. 'International culture' does not and cannot exist; conver- sely civilization, in the meaning defined above, has a naturd tendency to become international during its development, and in the end to embrace the whole world. This said, it is easy to understand that any policy of forced assimilation is only an attempt to vioIare nature. Yet we must not believe that the originality of civilixing bistasicdppes sets them in opposition to one another. On the contrary, in the same way that the specific characteristics of every nationality enrich the civilizing type to which it belongs, the originality of these types should irrprzkcdple combine to form a harmonious and coherent cultural whole that belongs to all humanity. The proof of the former is that, without impoverishing the cultural wealth of humanity we cannot dispense with the gift brought - ox to be brought - by each of these civili~ing Bixtorical #ypes, despite the hostility which infact too often rules relations between them. We can add that the account given in this chapter confirms our previous definitions of edtwe and cbi/!qation from a different angle. Considered from that angle and from the esoteric point of view, civilization - which tends to become universal - signifies the container of the mental @(ps_rcbipe) body of humanity, while culture in its variety represents its contmt. At the present time, the container is not yet complete, while the content appears like the filings in the image we used ro explain the true inner condition of ext~rior man. This analogy can be pushed a very long way. If we take humanity as a whole, in its ensemble, as a living being, we would recognize without difficulty the anarchistic and impulsive character of its existence to which the words of St Paul would apply: for what I wodd, tblat I do not; b,d what I"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"bade, that~do.'~ The rule of unstilble equilibrium between opposing forces -the classic formula of international politics-is an accurate dection of the inner existence almost universal to men, A ided by Danilevsky's doctrine-now adapted to our needs -we shall return to the idea that there are correspondences between the con- scious darts that the exterior man must accomplish to create a magnetic centre within himself and those necessary for the formation of a United Nations Organi~ation within human society. Those two processes are long and difficult. In both cases they only begin when 'B' influences are grasped and retained. We have said enough about this process in man in the kst volume of the mesent work. SO that we need not return to it. But we must add that 'B' 1 influences play a decisive role in the rational organization of the rontainer of the mental (Pgchiq~e) body of humanity. If conscio~sness (conscience), strongly reinforced by the catastrophe of the second world war, had not penetrated our minds, the Charter in its present form could never have been born. True, it is imperfect and very far from being consistently applied. If we study the sixteen volumes of the DOC#- nment~ of the Con feranra Pf United Nation$ on intcmtional ~r~ani~afion,'~ we will perceive without difficulty that its coming into the worId was painful. 'A' influences then played a major role in international. politics, as they still do today, acting as a brake. Yet these 'A' influences are no longer decisive as they were in the last century. Alongside decolonization; the principle of Liberg, Eq~ality, Fruterni~ gains ground daily and will soon be accepted all over the globe. It is easy to perceive the constant and profound transfor- mations that the international Organization is undergoing as a result. From the esoteric point of view, the organic flaw in the Charter is that, although proclaimed in the name of the Nations, it has jn fact created an inter-governmental. organization of States* in which delegates are neces- sarily bound by the instructions they are given. Thus the UN does not at present reflect true world opinion, since this would express a planetary consciousness which in fact remains unknown to it. To achieve this expression of the planetary consciousness, it would be necessary to modify the Chaster to make the Organization's statutes more democratic. The formula that seems moss appropriate would be the esrab- Jishment of a bicameral system which would place another assembly, an 11. Romans vii: 15. 12. Sm Francisco, 1945.16 volumes plus index, in collaboration with the Library of Congress, London, New Yotk, 1946. assembly of peoples with equal authority, dongside rhe current assembly of States. Sitting at the same place on the same dates, these two Assemblies would combine to form one supreme Assembly. While each Chamber: could only make recommendations, the vote of the supreme Assembly vould be decisive.13 I t is clear that this consuousness -and the acceptance of the supreme value of 'By influences not only by Statesmen but by governments as organisms- have not yet reached a suficimtly high level for the proposed system to take shape. Yet it would not be rash to say that in spite of all the difficulties and successive crises, dear indications exist of evolution in the direction indicated. This evolution is indispensable if this time of transi- tion is to end in success and not in a deIuge of Fire. T he reader must understand that this only sketches in the broad out- lines of the conditions essential for establishing an esoterically mean- ingful conbui#er for humanity's psychological body, taking that as a living being in the way described above. This is a abstdfpti~dlproblem, which must necessarily be solved during the decades immediately ahad of us. Parallel efforts will have to be made in the domain of content. On this essential point, only the emergence of the New Man from within all the p tesen t civiliqitg historical opes ourlined above will allow us to achieve this necessary task successfully. Is should be noted that this new type of Man has already started to emerge among the young generations who succeed that which emerged from the psychic anarchy engendered by the second world war. Time and conscious efforts are necessary for new dough (pait]) to rise.

Today, a century after that vision of genius, we can add something that will introduce it in a valid way to the present esoteric situation. Danilevsky conceived the evolution of civilizing types as a panorama (fresquee) of the past; we must try to transpose his conceptions to provide a projection of the future. For that, we must ibscaver exactly what is the present situation. The process is already in train. We can foresee the awakening in the nea future of all the civilixing Aimrfcal Qpe~, together forming the note LA o orgfinic Iqe on Earth, which itself consists of a principal octave and two lateral octaves. The Statesmen of tomorrow, by their unbending (mivix), synergic and conscious efforts, will form a Colltgt of Precwsors drawn from the ensemble of all the civf king types which will be capable-and must be capable-of creating the conditions necessary if the Era of the HoIy Spirit is to be effectively established among humans and on the Earth. A s the shape of this possible future emerges more and more cIearly from the fog of the next century, we must indicate practical measures which will allow it to become reality. It is important to decide on the first step to be taken in this direction; then the remaining steps will be easier to accomplish. This will certainly demand widespread action on the plane of the 'B' influences. To achieve this, we will need to change the direction of our present efforts. To place the emphasis on 'B' influences instead of on \"A' influences, those who are conscious of the urgency of t>is problem must adopt an invariable rule no longer to study what separates humans, in- dividually and collectively, but to investigate what links them organically, so that it can unite us all. This is the theme of the next chaprer. CHAPTER XN I n the Preface to the second part of this volume, we said that in the mesoteric cycle the study of the Universe should deal mainly with the question of cosmic and terrestrial organic ife, and particularly with the role of Man, his possibilities and his capabilities. In this chapter we will look at contemporary man in the framework in which he lives, to examine his 'historical context' more closely and show the direction of his possible evolution more clearly. This exmiination is indispensable as man has always fallen behrnd in his general evolution, and now, with the rapid approach of the era of the Holy Spirit, be must make haste to catch up or must face the danger of the 'Deluge of Fire'. The new Era is full of mar~erlous promise, but it also it presents immense demands which mankind must now face. It is within this framework that we shall briefly outIine in esoteric terms the broad sweep of the historical evolution that we are now witnessing. We shall try to emphasize the demands as well as the possibilities of the time, so I that we can learn whether we may be not only witnesses to but even the artisans of the near future, and if so, how we can achieve this in a positive I way. I T he theme of this chapter is Cbri~tianig, which forged our civilization and is the cradle of the next. We shall try to condense this vast subject by discarding everything that is not directly relevant. We have said more than once in this work that the esoteric Tradition, like the Truth itseIf, is One - but that the Revelation of this Truth, the source of this Tradition, was not divulged all at once. The Tradition is not petrified but moving, progressively enriched by the divulgence of new Truths that are continually metered out by Revelation to meet the needs of our time and situation (ca~se). In this way, the Revelation of the New Testarnenz enriched that of the Old, and the Testament of the new era of the Holy Spirit will enrich the two that preceded it. We rightly say: enriched, not replaced. Replacement (abolition) will nevertheless occur, as is did at the time of the passage from she Cycle of the Father to that of the Son, though this replacemcnt will happen only if man\" growth occurs as it should, following the principle expressed by St Paul the Apostle: When I"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"was a cbfid, 1 +ks ar a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child: but when 1 became a man, Ipt afuq chdldi1.h tbitgs..' It is from this angle that we shall examine the situation in which we now find ourselves, to grasp the problems of tomorrow so as to fmd the right way to solve them. In effect, the Tradition is One. And whoever succeeds in reaching, the Truth will gain access to the same singular Truth whether he is Christian or non Christian, believer or atheist. The Way to Salvation is One, and is is open to all; but many are the tracks and varied are the paths of access which lead to it. Christ is cosmic, and whoever is united to him becomes a Chri~iiaa, whatever the faith he confesses, King David had reached Christ, and Christ incarnated in Jesus was called the Sorr of Da~id. Yet when we speak of Christianity we generally mean the Christian confession, the early or historic Christian Church, the Christian Tradition and civilization. Within the framework of this necessarily summary definition, and with- out speaking of the mysteries of Initiation, it is important for our study to distinguish the features which differentiate Christianity from other reli- gions and phllosophico-religious systems. The essential particularities are four in number. We shall examine them one by one. I. -We should first remark that no other religion ar philosophical system apart from Christianity has ever aimed at ecurnenism. Even the fierce proselytism of Islam has stabili~ed,~ and that religion has suffered a set-back. The same fate is occurring to all the great religions of the world, living or dead. Christianity in its historical evolution presents quite a different picture. It is true that Christianity also suffered certain losses in the Middle Ages, from which Islam was the main bendciary, but it opposed the latter in the Crusades, an act of faith without precedence in the history of religions. Christianity has also suffered losses in modern times, occuIt Iosses which are impossible to estimate and which are a result of the propagation of the materialist and atheist doctrines that have accompanied the progress of science and technology. In this case we are dealing with a general phe+ nomenon, as progressives regard all religions as an 'opium 05 the people'. Yet there is one undeniably objective fact. Almost two thousand years ago, in a remote corner of Roman Empire, somebody taught a new I. I Corinthians xiii: 11. (Author's text). 2. This was true at the time, in the mid 19GOas, when this book was written, and mq stiU bol true of 'inner Islam' (Ed.). doctrine. His preaching lasted ody three years and ended in defeat: the preacher was executed. But on the eve of His death, He prophesied that the Good News he had brought waiiZd bepreached in alL the worldfar a witness rrnto oJZ nc~tions. If somebody were to be placed in the atmosphere of that time, taking the point of view of a cultured maa ofthe Greco-Roman society of the day-if we suppose that this propheq had reached his ears, then these pretensions would simply have made him smile. Today, nevertheless, it is an accom- plished fact: the Gospel has been translated into more than six hundred languages, and in every part of the world everybody is able to acquire it at a modest price if not free of charge, even in the places furthest from Pales- tine, so far that they were unknown to the ancient Mediterranean world. This is a miracle. And it is a miracle which we can verify (conrfaier) and recognize as such, for it is a material realization. This is the first particulariry of Christjanity. n. - The importance of this fact is enormous, although it passes almost unnoticed. The progress of the Gospels across the world has been accom- panied by another phenomenon which is the second particularity - one which is not given as much attention as it desems. The hegemony and 'coloniaEsmm that Europe has exercised wer the whole world for more than a century have spread the European civiliza- tion all over the globe. In this way my cultured person, whatever race, social class, sex or religion he beIongs to, sbdres in that civilization, and education everywhere is modelled on European lines. We can also say without losing a11 sense of prqortion that ways of thinking if not of living throughout the world are increasingly adopting the sale of values elaborared by the European mind over the centuries. And the European civiIization is essentially Christian. Yet nobody among us can eonstare just how much our ways of seeing, of thinking, of judging, are dominated and even impregnated by the maxims of the Gospel. On the planetary pIane, this universal participation in a civilization that is in essence Christian, nnd the extensive adoption of the moral criteria introduced by that same civilization, form a kind of underlying moral common denominator. This has been expressed on the one hand by the appearance of what we call today 'world opinion', and on the other hand, after sevemI fruitIess attempts during past and present centuries, by agteement on and by the signing of the UN Charter in San Francisco in 3. Matthew laiv: 14."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"1945.

On the spiritual level, its distinctive feature is that it is the ody religion that teaches the GeneralReswrection, one of the basic principles of its esoteric Tradition that is never mentioned in she Old Testament. 1V. -Lastly, the fourth distinguishing characteristic of Christianity, the most beautiful and the most important, is be, the Alpha and Omega of rhe Christian Doctrine: Sbo~Id I speak, said the Apostle, with the tong~es of men and of angels, TI Arne not he I am ar somding bras, or a ti~kling c_ymbaI.

Together they form a true universal common denominator, tending towards world unity and helping to achieve it. We are now playing a part in a curious phenomenon: the overwhelming progress of a science and a technology that are agnostic in their essence but are the products of this European civilization and are Iargely responsible for ies diffusion. Indirectly yet powerfulIy, these also serve to implant ways of study and thought throughout the world, and wirh these to implant a mentnhty and language nourished on Christian maxims, whose origin is often overlooked.

On this level, man\" attitude is manifested by his prafe~~ion of Faith. Although somewhat late, a tendency to unity has also appeared on this pIane. This is essentiauy religious. Little by little, religious tolerance gains groundinmen'sminds. The fires and flames of theinquisition, as well as the word or IsJam, have been relegated to History. Yet we cannot say that reJigiow intolerams has disappeared from the surface of the earth; it exists; it smoulders under the ashes; sometimes it breaks out again. But today the idea of igniting a religious war wouId be ~hirnerical.~ In spite of this marked fraternal tendency, the problem is very difficult to solve since, in this domain, the inflexible nature of the proftssion of Flu'tb precludes any agreement based on compromise. The trend towards unity on thr agreement, not of ex- clusive domination, has already b Christianity for more than half a century on the initiative ur its rroresram branch. This idea has slowly progressed to zhe point where to study the possibility of a union of Christian Churches is now the order of the day. It is known thnt this union has been a hope of the whole Christian world since the great schism of 1054, despite the fact that-one after the other- dl attempts to realize it in practice have systematically failed. The under- lying spiritual cause of this repeated failure - a21 polltical and other con- siderations aside-has its source in the very nature of theprofe~sion of Faith. The Orthodox Church does not admit the evolution of dogmat, regard- ing it to have been determined by the seven CEcumenical Councils which it strictly conforms to, conserving the Apostolic Creed unchanged. On the contrary, the Roman Church does admit the evolution of dogma; inspired by the Emperor Charlemagne, it introduced the famous addition of the 'Filioque' in the eighth article of the Creed, whch concerns the Holy Spirit. In addition to the seven truly oecumenical ~ouncils' -recognized by all- it acknowledges thirteen more to bring the total number to twenty. Other hfferences exist that are substantial if not essential, so that what has just been said is enough to make us understand how difficult it will be to achieve a union of Western and Eastern Churches by means of e~tettte- that is to say, of compromise, and this is to say nothing of the reformed Churches derived from the Roman Church.

What is involved here is theprofession ofFuidk, not intellectual I reasoning; we either believe or we do rtot believe. In this context, negotiation would simply be a glaring demonstration of the fact that we believed in nothing. 1 B ut the problem of the unity of the world on the spiritual plane now no longer depends on the isolated or collective initiatives from enligh- 1. tened minds, but on the historical movement towards material and psycho- intellectual unification. This unification is happening now as a fruit of our essentially Christian European civiIization, and it necessitates a union on she spiritual plane on that same Chridim basis - and in the direction I described in this chapter. Failure to achieve this unity would lead to a rending of the colIective soul of the whole of humanity in the same fashion as the partial divisions that occur in different parts of the world, of which we have become witnesses, victims or adsans since the first world war. I These conflicts carry with them a real threat of a general codagration. This assertion may surprise more than one reader, dthoagh if we were to proceed to a full anaIysis it is not difficult to understand that the key to red pace - and the prosperiry which depends on it, must be found on the moral and spiritual planes, and can no longer be based on the balance of jmver. This formula, which was unquestioned in the XIXth century, is already obsolete in the XXth. It certainly seems a little odd to say that today the key to Peace is to be found in the union of the Churches. Yet if that union were to be ralized on a healthy basis, without rontpromist, its influence would not be slow in spreading to other levels of human consciousness in a chain reaction like that we described in the first part of this chapter. A sound basjs wkfhu~lt compromise: these are the indispensable con& tions of success. The neglect of these conditions would unfailingly lead to an interior rending of the Churches on the day the act af union was signed. The majority of the faithful would not follow the prelates. This being so, it is easy to understand that dl attempts ta achieve unity between the Churches by means of a 'round table' would be doomed to failure in advance and might even aggravate the situation. This procedure could be compared to the addition of fractions in which only the numera- tors are totaIled without having previously having redud all the frac- tions to a common denominator. The problem is to find the necessav I common denominator. he main difficulty results from the rigidity of the profession of Faith. T To circumvent this we should search for a solution thxt does not affect the dogmar of the different Churches. This can be done without making onion impossible. The early Churches did not all profess their Faith in the same way, yet the same sacred Fire burned strongIy in them all. We must therefore drect out research towards a new poiq o~fside the dogmas, on which Churches can reach sincere agreement without questioning each other's profession of ~aith~ This idea is not new. Late in the XIXth century the Russian philosopher Nicolas Fedorov, in his Phia'osopky of the Comttpon c~NI~,' had already pse- sented the idea of a Third Tertament in the Christian East, and it is worth returning to this idea now that we are faced with the rapid approach of the era of the Holy Spirit. That Tbird Testamefib can be defined as including a higher degree of the Revelation - the third and last - precisely that of the Holy Spirit. Let us repeat: we speak here of rhe Revelation of that Gtpo~+s which Jesus transmitted to James the Just, John, and Peter after His resurrection. 'The latter gave it ro the other Apostles; and the other apostles gave it to the seventy, one of whom was ~arnabas\".\" This Gnosis, transmitted orally from one to the other down to Clement of Alexandria, Origen's master, was then hermeuzed because there were toe many lawsuits and dissensions, TO be divulged and taught once again today with the approach of the era of the Holy Spirit- the time when all that has been hidden must be brought to light, especially the Gnosir that was conserved in the esoteric Tradition of Orthodoxy. This must now be formulated in terms quite intelligible to the cultured reader, using the Cartesian mind and language. ?'his is the mission of Gtzo~i~, of which the rhird and last volume will mark the achievement, laying 2 stone in the foundations d the sublime Temple of the Third T~stm~ent, which must be built by the collective efforts of the Initiatedto serve as a common denomi~tztorfor the Churches of Christ. 8.

That is why in this second volume we return to the question of the Wg. At this point we believe that it is necessary to discover the exact place of the cultured man of our civilization and era in the light of the esoteric doctrine. This is a partial recapitulation of our acquired knowl- edge of the human Personality as it is shaped by the conditions of con- temporary life of this milieu as we now understand it. This takes the form of an analysis of exterior man, belonging -we repeat - to the cultivated stratum of society. The data obtained by this analysis cannot of course be applied to every member of this elite which, taken as a whole, forms the ruling class and plays the role of a moral guide for human society. Let us avoid general- izations: enforced equality is a misleading formula, it ignores the fact that a basic principle of Nature is unity in variety. It simply describes common stereotypes that form useful bases for analysis; we can leave the many and varied exceptions on one side until later. T o make the proposed psychological study easier we believe that it will be useful to introduce an idea that goes back to Greek Mythology, where it appears in the guise of a fabulous monster: the Chimera. In mythology, it appears to have the head of a lion, the body of a goat, the tail of a dragon, and it spews out vortexes of flame and fire. It was said that the Chimera's father was Typhon, the principle of evil and sterility, and his mother was Echidna, half woman and half serpent who was fathered by Chrisaor, born from the blood of Medusa. From Greek Mythology, the image of the Chimera passed into Christianity. We find it as an ornamental motif on certain Gothic cathedrals. For example, the gargoyles of Notre- Dame in Paris were sculptured in the form of Chimerae with stylized lion's heads and only the upper part of the body. In certain orthodox cathedrals chimerae form the ornament of the bishop's throne. Sculptured in wood, they are shown complete, crouching on each side of the seat, where they serve as armrests. 1 1. They are also used in similar ways in Orthodox monasteries such as those on Mount Athos. (Ed.)"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The original esoteric significance of this monster has been lost, although its symbolic meaning is known and its name has passed into current language: by chimera we mean a false idea or a vain imagining. A chilneric mind sustains itself on illusions, and a chimericproject collapses when tested against facts, being groundless or unrealizable. Let us try to rediscover the esoteric significance of the Chimera, hidden in Myth by initiatory tradition. We know that all beings in Nature are divided into three categories depending on the number of centres in their psyche. The first category is of beings having a psyche of only one centre: obviously the motor centre. Beings belonging to the second category have two centres: motor and emotional. Lastly, as beings possessing three centres, humans alone have a motor centre, an emotional centre, and an intellectual centre. The fabulous Chimera is an animal of a higher type; with its lion's head and the body of a goat, it incontestably ranks in the second category, that of beings possessing two centres in the psyche. If it was a living being, because of this fact it would have motor and emotional centres. It does actually have two centres in the psyche, but these are the motor and the intellectual. Thus it can only have an unreal existence, chimeric in the true meaning of that word, as no bi-centred beings exist in Nature other than those with motor and emotional centres. For what reason was this monster introduced into the Mythology of remote Antiquity which goes back to the very sources of Initiation? The symbolism of the Chimera must be studied in both its aspects, and this will help us to better understand the condition of exterior man, who is dominated by the provisional 'I' of the incomplete Personality as well as by the times in which he spends his life, that is to say, (in which we spend) ozlr lives. L et us return to the original diagram of the three centres of the psyche and the positive and negative duality of their normal functioning: We have seen that the motor centre is the most developed and the best organized of these three centres. When man is born, the latter centre is already functioning in a very complex way. The spermatozoa has a motor centre whose essential role is expressed by the motor function, while the instinctive function is ensured by the ovule and, starting from the moment of conception, by the instinctive part of the mother's motor centre. The motor centre presides over the constitution of the fetal body and regulates its growth and then its development until the pregnancy comes to term. After the birth of the child, the individualized motor centre ensures the growth of the human body and, with the help of the intellectual centre-or sometimes guided by it, its development, which includes a physical and psycho-physical apprenticeship. This means that in man, from day of his birth the motor centre works fully in its positive, instinctive as well as its negative motor parts. It is also the bearer of all the predispositions, those of the body as well as the psyche, that man gets through the blood of his heredity, as well as from his own early experiences. If, in the case of motor centre, a certain amount of education and instruc- tion are necessary to complete its development, in the case of intellectual centre the opposite is true, and everything must be done anew, for it is born virgin: a tabula rasa. It must learn everything, and its entire formation must yet be carried outs2 0 ne might say that the whole modern system of public education - primary, secondary and higher -is oriented almost exclusively to- wards the growth and development of the intellectual centre. Our culture is intellectual par excellence; the title of Intellectfial signifies that a man of our times, whatever his social class, is able to play an active part in the evolution of contemporary culture. Alongside the exaggerated development of the motor and intellectual centres, the emotional centre in cultured contemporary man looks like a poor relation. In effect human society-now mediated by public authorities -has little concern for its development. Not only is religious instruction 2. It is the same for the lower emotional centre in the newborn. It is a tabula rasa, and this allows it to receive certain energies from the higher emotional centre, since this is ever pure. But it still needs to be completely educated, just like the lower intellectual centre."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"no longer obligatory in civilized countries, but it is influenced by the prevailing mood; it is, one might say, 'intellectualized'. It is therefore not surprising that, left to its own fate, man's emotional centre degener- ates even further with age. For the law is explicit: that which does not grow and develop will degenerate as a result. This state goes unnoticed. On the one hand it is universal, and on the other the circumstances in which we now live never demand of man the development ofhis emotional centre, as occurs with the other two centres. By the intensive development of his motor or his intellectual centre, the man of our times can build a brilliant career with no need to turn to the essential functions of the emotional centre. The op- posite is true. Man sometimes fears its interference, as it can 'shuae the cardsy3 of his cold and realist calculations and hinder a career pursued under the guidance of the two other centres, and in this way it can con- siderably complicate the efforts he makes to reach the only ends that seem real to him. In general, the emotional centre is more active in very young children before they become conscious of the 'I' of their Personality, because it is then appreciably more pure. If the child's motor centre does not include too many innate predispositions, nor are they too negative, and as long as his intellectual centre is not yet sufficiently developed to dominate, the emotional centre will act and the motor centre will often back down and follow in its footsteps, particularly if the type of the child is man 2. Due to education and training, oriented in our civilization towards the intensive training of the negative part of the motor centre and towards an intellec- tual culture, in cultured circles of the life of the psyche the activity of the emotional centre is forced even further into the background, to fall into a sleep bordering on lethargy. This is the principle cause of the obviously unbalanced development of the human Personality: highly intelligent, and skilful enough as far as the negative part of his motor centre is concerned, man is dynamic in these two domains yet reveals weakness and a striking passivity on the emotional plane. T he life of our times imposes a very great but one sided tension on the functions of man's psyche-especially on his attention in all its aspects, as well as on his intellectual capacities. This fact creates a reaction in man emotional life, which would then be adequate to his intellectual culture, and had that been the case, man's instinctive and motor life, in times of relaxation, would have been synchronized with the vibration of the emo- tional centre, enveloping that of the intellectual centre. This would give access to the path towards the sublimation of sex. Moments of relaxation conceived in this way would then lead to creative inspiration, which is analogous on the plane of the psyche to conception on the physical plane. All the opportunities for man's esoteric evolution while working in the world lie in this. Nevertheless, several preliminary conditions must be fulfilled before he can reach this possibility. This is a possibility (apanage) for man 4, who is approaching the second Threshold and ready to pass through the Gate of the Kingdom of Heaven with his body and soul united to those of his polar being. It is obvious that this is not the case for someone who has just crossed the first Threshold and struggles to climb the Staircase. But the neophyte must never lose sight of this possible result of his efforts, the first tangible result to which he must ardently aspire. It is by keeping the image of this divine state constantly present in mind, while at the same time constating his actual state in its naked truth, that he will be able to create within himself a 'difference of potential' capable of producing a high tension current of energy sufficiently strong to allow him to pursue his esoteric work with some chance of success. I n order to be better aware of the true state of the Personality of the contemporary cultured man, we shall recapitulate what we know about all this. Let us observe that generally even if the positive part of the emotional centre is in an almost uninterrupted state of lethargy, if not actually paralysed, its negative part acts frequently. It reacts particularly to disagreeable shocks either from the outside or from within. These are the negative emotions we have already mentioned, remarking on their de- structive effect^.^ 1n that respect, man largely follows the habits of animals: at the least unpleasantness the machinery of negative emotions begins to act. In general, the effect of this negative reaction greatly exceeds the importance of its cause. Having said this, we can represent the Personality of cultured contemporary man by amending the previous diagram as follows: and leads to a need for relaxation in order to restore equilibrium. If the development of the centres of his psyche had been balanced, this relaxation would have found its normal expression in his positive 3. Fr: brouilier ies cartes 4. Cf.

This is a chimerical being, vomiting vortexes of flame and fire on every occasion. In his march towards death, a man whose psyche is formed in this way can in fact, like the Chimera, lay claim to the paternity of Typhon, the principle of evil and esoteric sterility. This is the hellenic image of the Devil in his aspect of liar and father of lies, of whom Jesus spokes5 In the Greek text of that passage of the gospel according to St John we read, to pseudos (76 $EC~OS), a word that has passed into the European languages and has come to signify false. We can now better penetrate the meaning of Christ's words to the Pharisees:you have the Devil for a father andyou want to accomplish the covetousness ofyour fathera6 In such a being, the intellectual centre is generally very developed. Although this phenomenon is positive in itself, yet the result is that the intellectual centre weighs heavily on the remainder of the Personal- ity. This imbalance is exaggerated even further by the fact, explained above, that the positive part of the emotional centre - the most precious organ in the whole organism of man's psyche - is semi-paralysed. From then on the negative part, left to itself, is deprived of all possibility of fulfilling its useful or constructive role of supporting the other in its work. It only comes into movement to allow man to express his negative emotions, so he does so over and over again in spite of their destructive effects. Let us note once again that this state of man's emotional centre is ana- logous to that of wild animals, in which the positive part of this centre generally remains unawakened. In cultured man it falls into lethargy 5. John viii: 44. 6. Ibid. The more normal reading is: 'Ye are ofyow father the devil, and the lurtr ofyour fatheryou will 1.' (King James version) because it is neglected. The difference is that an animal cannot awaken it except by ceasing to be an animal, whereas man can do this at any time by conscious efforts made in appropriate exercises. As the diagram above shows, in the majority of cultured men of our times the positive part of the emotional centre is practically paralysed after the highly intensive development of an intellectual culture: feelings too easily give way to calculation, As for the motor centre, in the case that concerns us this works at full capacity. Responsible for the natural instinctive and motor functions that ensure the life of the organism and the movements of the body, it has always been the object of special training: military, sporting, artistic etc. But in addition, because of the state of lethargy of the positive part of the emotional centre in contemporary man, for good or ill the motor centre also replaces it in its functions. The motor centre replaces the positive tenderness of affection, which the dormant emotional centre is incapable of providing, by the passionate tenderness of sensations domi- nated by a spirit of possession. In this domain too, the life of man's psyche is then lowered to the level of that of an animal. All this allows us to better understand the structure of man's Personality, which is then practically reduced to bicentrism, the very characteristic of the chimera: a lion's head to represent intelligence and an animal's body with the tail of a dragon to symbolize passions deprived of all feeling. The fire and flames vomited from its mouth are the fire of discord and the flame of intellectualized passions stimulated by usurped sexual energy. T hat is a schematic but realistic representation of the Personality of a cultivated man of our times, whose emotional centre is neglected. That state is full of danger. For without the compass represented by the positive part of that centre, man, although inheritor of a great intellectual culture which can be of considerable value to him and those around him and finally for human society, remains entirely weaponless when faced with his own passions, especially if those are induced by or even associated with a sexual inclination that is deformed in one way or another. This can even bar his path to esoteric evolution. 7 The danger of this situation becomes obvious when we compare the two figures that represent the psyche's instrument of moral& in the two cases: - the normal case, that of a Personality which is developed and equilibrated; 7. Refer to I Corinthians vi: 10."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"- the abnormal case that is far too frequent, that of the bicentric chimeric Personality. To get to a technically true representation of how morality functio exterior man, we should know that the 'links' between the three centre! the psyche, of which we spoke in the first volume, are in reality much m complex than we previously described.' These links are realized by me of the sectors in each centre that represent the two others in their posit as well as their negative expressions. The diagram of a normal case maj as shown as follows: +@ - me. s of ore ans We find twelve links in that figure, four of which begin from each of the three centres. This represents the complete instrument of human morality, an instrument that is in itself very sensitive, and whose twelve chords correspond exactly with the structure of this phenomenon. In the case we examined above, however, because the positive part of the emotional centre is practically paralysed, the negative part cannot exercise its positive role. The only thing left to it is to make the centre vibrate with negative activity in the form of negative emotions. But negative emotions ofthis composite nature take coarse forms, ruled by sensations and passions that belong to the motor centre. This allows us to constate yet again that in this unbalanced or chitneric aspect of the human Personality the emotional centre must be considered as an almost negligible quantity. On this basis the previous diagram must be modified as shown in figure 14 (overleaf). When the emotional centre is deprived of its normal functions, the number of links between centres is reduced from twelve to four. The eight chords which correspond to the finest and most subtle components of human morality are eliminated. This is due to the changes that occur in the structure of both the intellectual and motor centres; changes that lead to the impoverishment of both as the emotional sectors of these two centres practically disappear, due to the disappearance of their source since the emotional centre is in a state of lethargy. Because of this, the intellectual as well as the motor centre is left with only four active sectors instead of six. Psychologically, this means that, having reached this state of disequili- brium in his Personality, man is from then on governed only by intellectual and instinctive-motor considerations. This human type - the chimeric - is often found among the cultured classes of our time. It can produce people of great intellectual ability, but since intelligence is agnostic by nature and they are not oriented by the compass9 of the emotional centre, such people become amoral. For them everything isperr~issible except what is forbidden: or rather, what is not punishable. When man of this psychological type feels the need for relaxation-which is legitimate in itself-he falls under sway of his bodily instincts. His 'I' of the body then takes the place of the 'I' of the unbalanced Personality. However, the 'I' of the body only has the use of the motor centre, which is equally mutilated. Since this is reduced to four sectors instead of six it too is deprived of a compass. Man then turns towards 'small pleasures' or 'grand passions' in which he satisfies all his senses, driven by an inventive intellectual imagination while the two centres, motor and intellectual, are fed by energy stolen from the sexual centre. 8.

True, we have discussed an extreme case so that it is more clearly impressed on the reader's mind; but there exist other cases that are less extreme and more subtle. To put a final point to this, we have only to answer the question that confronts those who wish to pass from words to acts: how can we awaken the emotional centre and then develop it? The answer is simple: by mas- tering negative emotions and transmuting them into positive emotions. W e have pointed out more than once that the majority of people belonging to the cultured stratum of our society who are seriously interested in esoteric studies have in one way or another undergone an inner collapse in their lives. This collapse often floors them. However, after going through this bankruptcy, many of them recover. These are the people suitable for esoteric work. , From this point of view, the value of moral bankruptcy lies in the fact that someone who has been through this can recognize not only theore- tically, but through experience and with a broken heart, the futility of chimerical happiness, 'bourgeois' self-satisfaction, and human pride. I Such a bankruptcy is therefore an excellent starting point from which to search for the Way which leads to Life. Sometimes, however, a man endeavours to 'start his life' all over again. He believes that by taking into account and lucidly analysing his experi- ences he can do better in spite of his previous failure. But this is nothing but a new illusion which generally leads to a new bankruptcy, something that is extremely logical as long as the new experience contains nothing which is really new: in a different form he simply repeats the same 'ad- venture' again and again. Carried away by the psychological pressure that 1 the General Law exercises over him, he does not pause to reflect that the old path can only lead him to the old result. There are always frenzied people who start all over again in spite of everything, sometimes several times over. They are happy enough with the adventure itself, taking its unwinding as the goal, as they do not know that this romance can have a realgoal, one that is even higher and more beautiful than the flirtation or marriage that so often proves the tomb of love. Side by side with these 'enthusiasts' we meet people who, after one or more negative experiences, end by perceiving the diabolical element in the snare they are caught in. Having no faith in their hearts, they confine themselves to a scepticism which they describe as realism, sheltering behind the classic opinion that happiness only lasts as long as the Illusion is maintained. But there is a third category of people who are awakened by recurring bankruptcy. Stimulated instead of subdued by failure, they do not consent to lay down their arms. With hearts full of faith, they seek a way out from this vicious circle like the prisoner who, shut in a dark cell, searches blindly for an exit."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Eveything can be straightened out if it is not too late: if man is not morally crushed or physically spent and if, even after having gone through one or more moral bankruptcies, he has not yet lost the faculty for burning with enthusiasm. Otherwise, it is useless to break those lances. The human being who analyses, in the light of the esoteric doctrine, the circumstances that have provoked his moral bankruptcy is bound to con- clude that this failure is directly due to the neglected state into which his emotional centre has fallen. If he goes back to the causes and the events that have been lived, he will see that his partner is not to blame. We must never forget that intelligence is agnostic by nature, so that it is only through the correct and intense functioning of his emotional centre that the exterior man can feel the 'By influences in life without confusing them with the 'A' influences. It is thanks to this discernment, stimulated by a keen interest in the work and by the ardent desire to reach the Real, that a magnetic centre begins to form in the neophyte. Only then can he come out of the darkness as he desires. The reader may remember that the magnetic centre is formed starting from the lower emotional centre, which it progressively absorbs before it is finally integrated into the higher emotional centre, the doorway to Light and real Life. Leaving out some details, this is the technique of esoteric evolution. In other words, the development of the Personality - the astral fetus - and the equilibrium of its organs, the lower centres, which leads to the second Birth, cannot be envisaged without the previous corqlete development of the lower emotional centre. This is the first key and the real beginning of esoteric evolution. L et us now study a few typical cases of unbalanced Personality in exterior men, as this unbalanced character is responsible for the moral bankruptcy described above. This should make it easier for us to recognize our own case and, having analysed it in the light of esoteric science, to correct the situation through conscious efforts. First case. To begin with, let us take the case of imbalance we described in the previous chapter: that of the cultured man of our times, man 3, who has received extensive intellectual training Vormation), and is successfully ex- ercising an intellectual profession. We have already sufficiently examined the working of the Personality of this type of man, and the characteristic I interdependence of the centres of his psyche, which automatically leads to i a limping equilibrium, so that we need never return to it again. We shall try to recognize one or more human psychological types to which this kind of deformation gives birth. To do this, let us add details to the previous figure (fig.14) as follows: We can see from this that this highly developed intellectual centre is deformed in such a way that the hypertrophied pure intellectual and in- tellectual-motor sectors, have almost entirely smothered the emotional sectors. For reasons given in the previous chapter, this smothering often goes so far that, to pick out the resulting situation in relief, we have shown the emotional sectors in figure 14 in the background. These sectors are in a lethargic state like that of their source; if they are not non-existent in practical terms they are at the least always inoperative. In the motor centre of the human type we are studying, the smothering of the emotional sectors has a different character. Although the function- ing of those sectors is almost nonexistent-just as in the intellectual centre, and again due to the lethargic state of the emotional centre-because of the principle of Equilibriutn there appears little by little a kind of tumour of the psyche. This tumour of hypersensitivity builds up over the positive part of the motor centre; it is shown in the diagram by a cap in the shape of a half- moon. It covers the higher semicircle of the motor centre. This tumour, which is formed and kept working by sexual energy and is connected to the three sectors of the positive part of the motor centre, possesses its own tripartite structure in which the proportions (of the centres in the Personality as a whole) are inverted: the emotional part of the tumour is much more developed than the intellectual and motor parts. The following diagram gives details ofthe motor centre with its cap:"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Emotional ///////: Intellectual Motor IIIIIII Let us remember that in the organism of this type of humanpyche, this cap-tumour stands in for the emotional centre. It does this as best it can, substituting sensations impregnated with usurped sexual energy for true feelings: this carnal tenderness replaces the noble tenderness of the heart. In this type of man the influence of the Absolute III eliminates and replaces that of the Absolute 11. A man like this, whose hypertrophied intellectual centre outweighs his Personality as a whole, only takes into account his own reasons so that, to use the language of the tradition, he never stops cruczfying Christ. Sexual energy, SI-12, is not of same nature as the pure feeling of SOL-12, although it possesses the same fineness. The latter (energy) is missing in a man of this type. That is why he falls under the domination of the former. As long as this situation prevails, such a man proves incapable of opposing an effective resistance to this dominion, and as long as the positive part of his emotive centre is lethargic, man has no reason to resist, and indeed does not resist the calls of sex that result from this condition of his centres. Conversely, in moments of relaxation, with the tacit agreement of the 'I' of the Personality, which desires a change of impressions, the 'I' of the body dictates its will to man instead of his real 'I). This situation explains the paradoxes of our life. In spite of all appear- ances it slips away, guided by the general principle expressed in the for- mula: cherchea la femme ... From behind the scenes of waking consciousness, and under the influ- ence of the Moon's soporific rays, the Absolute 111 exercises a despotic power over man. To him man joyfully brings his offerings. Moreover, this is according to the General Law, because without procreation to ensure the incarnation of Souls, the human species would have ceased to exist and the result would be the collapse of our Ruy of Creation. To complete this description, and to place the type we have just analysed in its proper context, let us add that man 3, formed-or rather deformed- in this way, now lives and works in an ambiance 3, which has been shaped in our civilization by the attitude of an elite composed of various intellectual types who share a common characteristic, which is their desire to taste the well-being that the aristocrat and then the bourgeois enjoyed before them: The power that money confers to obtain comfort and distractions to balance the considerable and sometimes exhausting efforts the Intellectual has to make in his profession. In the esoteric sense, however, Intellectual does not only mean people involved in the sphere of university life. In the meaning used by the Doctrine, the term Intellectual refers to all men 3. In the more restricted meaning of the present analysis, we mean every man 3 who works in some branch of human activity which enables them to use their intellectual capacities to the maximum: a domain which extends from the most simple calculations and combinations directly concerned with material gains, to research leading to discoveries in the different branches of the pure or applied sciences. Scholars, diplomats, engineers, lawyers and politicians are found here alongside civil servants, financiers, merchants and industrialists etc. Pro- moters, negotiators and journalists belong to the same category. The Doctrine also includes all kinds of doubtful people: business manipula- tors, knights of industry, cheats etc., people of little scruples in their activities who yet do not transgress the limits fixed by legality. Their major concern is the search for large and easy gains while keeping up appearances. This category also includes all kinds of prostitutes and social climbers. It is true that the intelligence of these people is far from being as developed and subtle as that of scholars. Yet it is sharp enough to analyse the terms of legislation or contract and discover loopholes which allow them to suggest a false interpretation by which they can profit. One may say that in our days, this kind of deformation is quite common in the average type of man 3. Second case. This kind of imbalance in the Personality of man 3 may also be found in the equally chimerical Personality of a certain type of man 1. But in the latter case this Personality imbalance makes a criminal. Here is the diagram of this case:"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Details of cap Third case. Emotional ///A Intellectual \\\\w Motor 1111111 FIG. 18 Iwn ram We can now study the type of man 2 who occupied the leading place in European society from the early Middle Ages until the Renaissance: the Knight. In the Intellectual all efforts are directed towards the development and exploitation of the faculties acquired by the intellectual centre, while the neglected emotional centre falls into almost lethargic mental sleep. In the Knight, we observe the opposite phenomenon: a great development of the lower emotional centre that relegates the intellectual centre to the background of waking consciousness. However, the intellectual centre of this type of man cannot, and has never, attained the degree of lethargy which characterizes the emotional centre of man 3. Indeed, although the We will constate a certain analogy between this figure and the one shc idea seems difficult to accept, man can do without emotion in his in fig. 15. In both cases, the emotional centre is asleep. But in this diag, life: professional, family, social or political. Even though, from the esoteric the relative development of the intellectual and motor centres is inverted point of view, this life has only chimerical value, it is nevertheless a real and the cap is in a different place, so that it now covers the negative possibility, especially if the environment is favourable like that which semicircle of the intellectual centre. This cap is the instrument that allows prevails in our times and our civilization But man cannot abolish his this type of man 1 to place his intellectual centre, sometimes highly devel- intelligence to the same measure. In that situation he would lower himself oped, at the service of a malevolent spirit which expresses his bestial purely and simply to the level of the beast, with all the consequences that instincts. When his criminal projects succeed, it is through this cap that follow. He would become an idiot in the eyes of men. Such cases exist: a the man experiences the savage joy that his hypertrophied motor centre healthy, sometimes quite strong body with a tendency to obesity, very developed sexual functions, a highly emotional life but coarse and uses manifests. While the man 3 who has deceitful or amoral tendencies is careful not to primitive language. These are pathological cases, which may be repre- sented by the diagram in Fig. 19. transgress the limits of those acts that fall within the law, this type of man 1 runs headlong into that risk. This comes from the fact that the cap, The diagram of the Knight is quite different (see fig. 20): although facilitating his use of the intellectual centre to elaborate his criminal projects, nevertheless prevents him from extending his reason- ing to foresee the almost inevitable consequences of the crimes he com- mits. From one point of view, this particularity distinguishes an unscrupulous cheat of type 3 from the man of type 1 we have just analysed. It is also this particularity which makes of the latter an inveterate offender. However, we should not confuse this classic type of criminal with the honest man who commits a crime because of fatal circumstances or who is blinded by momentary weakness. People of this category are not true criminals, but unhappy wretches."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The main characteristics of the Knight4 type are his sense of equity and his devotion to duty. He aspires to accomplish deeds which may even lead him to sacrifice his life, and he will take any risk gladly for a beautiful ideal. One must not think that this type of Knight only belongs to bygone ages and that he is extinct today. This type always exists. However, he seldom comes to power in the environment 3 that characterizes our epoch. For modern methods of selection demand a certain suppleness, an elasticity of character on the part of those who aspire to leading roles and which for the Knight is completely foreign to his nature. If he competes in the race towards the summit of the human hierarchy, he soon gives up the strug- gle, either by his own action or because the circumstances eliminate him automatically. We can come across this type of human being in all strata of society; but in our intellectualized environment he is unlucky in business as well as in politics. On the other hand, he may make a military career or find a post in the magistracy or devote himself to social work. The different degree of development, and the particular nature of his intellectual and motor centres, lead to a whole series of psychic and psychological shadings in this type of man 2. Besides this classical type of Knight, there are others who fall into the same general category, like the hermit-monk, the Pro- phet, and the Apostle. One may also include artists of all kinds. Fourth case. There exists another type of deformation of the Personality of the man 2. But it is to be found only in a few rare cases, above all in the Christian Orthodox, Muslim or Hindu Orient. It is the man who is mad for theglory of God. This case may be represented as follows: These madmen mortify their body in all kinds of ways; dressed in rags, they spurn money, sexual pleasure, power, the rulers of this world, and death. Such a madman is afraid of nothing, he is even less afraid than the common type of Knight, for nothing is important to him, neither 'con- siderations' nor respect for conventions. In Russia, in times past, these madmen enjoyed a certain esteem. Seated in the outer sanctuary of a cathe- dral, they would tell the powerful men who came there a few home-truths. Even the Czars did not escape criticism, and often altered their decisions if the latter were subject to the disapproval of these men. They were highly venerated by all, as they were believed to be 'men of God', and were supposed to possess the faculty of thought-reading. So the man mad for the glory of God is also a man 2, just like the Knight, the army officer, the hermit-monk or the magistrate, each type representing the characteristic shadings of his type. Fifth case. Another typical deformation of human Personality also exists. This case is rather rare in its extreme form but today as in the past weaker forms can be met in all eras and strata of society, especially in the Orient. Three or four hundred years ago this human type became widespread in the West: this was the sorcerer. A ferocious fight was waged against them. The case we are to study is that of a man 1 whose highly developed motor centre entirely dominates his emotional centre. In this type of man the latter is awake and even quite developed, but it is under the sway of the motor centre and as a result it is richly nourished by usurped sexual energy. As in the fourth case, the intellectual centre is not entirely asleep: the negative part of this centre is paralysed but the positive part is completely under the domination of the motor centre. That is why this type of man feels no doubt. This fact provides him with extraordinary strength and endows his psyche with a suggestive, hypnotic dynamism. This type of man 1 includes fakirs, sorcerers, magicians: volkhy~ in Sla- vonic. Though unbalanced in its development, this Personality has lost all its anarchistic characteristics: it is subjected to an iron discipline exercised by the motor centre in the place of the magnetic centre, with the 'I' of the body predominant. This kind of man can acquire certain powers, but their nature differs from that of the giftJ of the Hob S'irit which interior men acquire. A magician's power - that of a Cagliostro, Rasputin and their like -is based, as we said, on excessive development of the motor centre, which dominates the other two. The working of the intellectual centre is reduced"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"to what is strictly necessary to ensure vital needs and to elaborate projects; its negative part is smothered, and this is what leads to the absence of doubt. The emotional centre is not only not smothered but is rather well developed. However, this development is unbalanced, as it is not the result of correct discernment of 'B' from 'A' influences, but of the accumulation of those of the latter whose action, although different in quality, liesparallel to the 'B' injuences. Lastly, an overgrowth on the psyche is formed on the right side of the emotional centre of this type of man 1, which shows all the characteristics of an impure or black magnetic centre. While the magnetic centre formed of 'B' influences is a subsidiary organ enabling esoteric develop- ment, this black magnetic centre formed by 'A' influences can clearly not be oriented towards esoteric goals. Shaped by 'A' influences whose action runs parallel to the 'B' influences, the orientation of this black magnetic centre is automatically directed towards objectives limited to within the perimeter of exterior life. These objectives are well known; money, women, and power in all their forms. This type of unbalanced development of Personality, which gives birth to the sorcerer in all its aspects, is shown below: The reader will remember the diagram in chapter VI of the first volume (fig. 21), accompanied there by a brief explanation. Evidently the black magnetic centre, instead of sending man forward towards the second Birth and so towards the union of his Personality with his real 'I), emphasizes and crystallizes the 'I' of the Personality and inspires it with the strength it needs to impose itself on other Personalities who are in an unstable inner state. It is important to know that this human type exists, especially for those who have an inclination for esoteric research and who begin by looking for the 'marvellous.' While awaiting an encounter with a guide, their Person- ality is wide open to the influences emanating from this type of man, and they may easily fall under his sway. Such a 'guide' may be represented by the diagram from the first volume we have just described. We reproduce it here because of its great importance: The scriptures and authorized commentaries have drawn seekers' atten- tion to this danger many times. This is why it is written that the children of thislvorldare more cunning than the children oflight.' Beginning long ago, many warnings have been given about this.2 Besides giving birth to magicians, this type of man gives rise to false false Christs, and even the ~ntichrist.~ It is curious to see how much these false prophets, magicians and 'christs', impressed themselves on the imagination of the men -and even more of the women of the past. It is the same today. For there is a type of human being who declines all moral responsibility for himself or for those to whom he is in duty bound. One comes across this type quite often, always trying to find someone else to shoulder his re- sponsibilities as long as this someone else possesses some kind of authority, earned or otherwise. These people are open to any form of hypnotic sug- gestion and practically ask to be hypnotized. They are of good faith, but they search for the 'marvellous' because they are too weak or too lazy to undertake esoteric work successfully. And the 'wolves'5 devour them finding justification in the fact that they are only the 'scourings of humanity.' But this is not true; for 'scourings' who are converted can become key figures on the esoteric chess-boar>. Mental apathy and emo- tional inertia are responsible for tipping: man down the slope of least 1. Luke xvi: 8. From the Slavonic text. 2. Acts xx: 29. 3.

The error of conception committed in this case lies in the fact that an important esoteric rule has been overlooked: that it is impera- tive for the seeker to be constantly active. He must always keep theinitiative, beginning with the search for and choice of a guide and later in the work he accomplishes under the latter's guidance. In a word, when participating in this work, he must be a subject, and not an object. This is a necessary condition for this kind of work. If it is not sufficient to provide the whole effort the neophyte must accomplish in his search on the Way, it is always enough to allow him to escape from the claws of the 'wolves'. Initiative, vigilance, a critical mind, observation and discern- ment ... these different aspects of the seeker's active state, are diametrically opposed to the passive drowsiness of one who plunges head down into the jaws of the 'wolf' full of condescending compassion towards sceptics because: thus spake Zarathrustra. Sixth case. Although these stereotypes or deformations pushed to the extreme are rare, we must mention yet another variation of the case we have just analyzed. We more commonly observe the deformations we have de- scribed in such a milder or partial form that a man of good faith cannot recognize to which case his own deformation belongs. This is normal, considering that we do not know ourselves. However, there is a case which merits our special attention. It is the deformation which, pushed to the extreme, makes the man a black ma- gician or false prophet, enabling him to acquire certain psychic powers. The Personality's partial deformation in this sense also plays a role in life. Constituted in this way, a man unknowingly acquires a certain influence over those around him; hypnotic influences of the 'A' kind emanate from him. And this can happen not only to the man of type 1, but equally to types 2 and 3. Someone who undertakes esoteric work seriously must guard against these hypnotic influences which can emanate from him without his knowl- edge, and which create new karmic burdens for him which he must later neutralize by conscious efforts. There is yet another valid reason for dis- trusting one's own hypnotic influences. The latter automatically look for fertile ground: weak natures, generally not very deep, are open to them, especially in women subject to a morbid mysticism sometimes accompa- nied by certain sexual inclinations. When one gives in to them, these influences only accentuate the degeneration of such natures. CHAPTER XVII N ow we must get down to the essential problem that faces the faithful throughout his individual work, the working of the emotional cen- tre, its tuning, its development, and the practices which allow this devel- opment. But before doing this we must emphasize a certain point. The first task of someone who seeks the Way is to identify his basic type among the fundamental types of exterior man. Having done this, he must try to recognize and determine the nature of the deformation and the character of the imbalance in his Personality. For the seeker, the tabulation of types of these deformations outlined in the preceding chapter is the instrument with which he can work: the Tradition calls it the Mirror - and gives it this name because it helps the neophyte to recognize himself. The Tradition knows of other Mirrors: this term is applied to the Decalogue, as well as to the commandments of the New Testament. And the following recommendation, quoted earlier, is given to students: look at yourself with the Commandments asyou would with a mirror. A group of disciples containing all three basic types of exterior men and, within these three types, representatives of the six variations correspond- ing to the six sectors of the lower centres, when they are already quite advanced, forms what is called a living Mirror. In effect, taken as whole a group constituted in this way possesses every chord natural to the human psyche; as a result, it is capable of every reaction that only the fully devel- oped Personality of man 4 can experience when, in all his fullness, he is ready to cross the second Threshold. Directed by an elder and faced with this living Mirror during a meeting, the neophyte becomes transparent, to use a well-used expression. He isseenin every aspect or facet of his psyche. Before such a group, he is incapable of dissembling his thoughts, his feelings or his passions behind a mask of lies. Although socially speaking this may be a disagreeable trial, from the esoteric point of view it is a most useful op- portunity, where he can try and gather precious information about himself, information that he sorely needs at the beginning of his work. We will say again that the man 4, who has a fully developed and dis- ciplined Personality, sees in the common run of men what the disciples who are on the steps of the Staircase see only collectively in a meeting that combines the elements we have just described. We should know that everything is written on the human face; but one must know how to read it. The same goes for the human body; its attitudes, its behaviour, its walk,"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"or the poses it strikes in different situations, all betray the inner content of the man. Having learned to know himself, man 4 can decipher others. A room full of spectators to a certain extent resembles the gathering of disciples we described. Indeed, it should contain representatives of all eighteen sectors of the lower centres of the human Personality. And it is common knowledge that if an audience is not influenced by some inter- vention from outside, by propaganda or by passion, its reactions are usually very sound. The seeker will come across other Mirrors on his path. They will appear in the form of problems from the domain of the 'A' influences, problems which have a karmic origin which he must solve in the spirit of the 'By influences that conform to the practical demands of the esoteric work in which he participates. Sometimes, a Mirror ofthis kind may take the form of a test. According to the way in which he surmounts it, something which becomes clear only after the event, the seeker can judge the progress he has made on the Staircase. The scriptures and the writings ofzlnblinded men are also Mirrors because they have depth. After having read them once and put them aside for a certain time, if he has made some progress in the esoteric sense the disciple who takes them up again will discover new insights. The depth ofa given text corresponds to the depth of its author. For the reader to fully understand the contents of a document, the depth of his being must be or become equal to that which the author displays in his work. The depth of Jesus' words is very great. This is why we said that the Gospel is still very little 'exploited', perhaps up to 5% or 10% of its depth. Doubtless even this estimate is highly optimistic. At regular intervals, frequent readings of the Gospel, the Apostles, the Masters of the aecumenical Church, and certain authors who have rid themselves of blindness will enable the seeker to recognize the progress he has made on the path of esoteric studies. T hese Mirrors in their different forms help the seeker to know himself. However, they have to be used with great care if they are to yield good results, because one finds many fine shadings between different human types. Besides the variety of sirnple cases, one may come across double cases. This happens when two semi-autonomous nuclei ofwaking consciousness are formed in the unfinished Personality of the subject. Previously we called them lumps. 1. Ref. Vol. I, pp. 36-37 Let us take for example the case of a man who has the nature of a Knight, but has been born in our epoch, in our civilization, and is engaged in a career which does not correspond to his human type. Let us suppose that he has become an industrialist, merchant or a financier instead of joining the army or entering the magistrature. Generally, he will not succeed in this kind of activity, nor will he gain any satisfaction from it. Not being very business-minded, he will be imprudent, and he will be cheated and even crushed by the shrewdness of the 'children of this world2.* The success obtained by those who are born for business -whether men 3 or 1 with all their different variations -will seem will-o-the-wispish and illusory to him. And if ever he lets himself get ensnared in the game, it can only lead him to the brink ofa quagmire disguised as a flower bed ... An old Hindu Tradition warns one against these errors of orientation by pro- claiming that: another person's dharma3 is full of danger. And this is one of the main reasons why the Aryan sages and leaders divided the race into four castes, right from the beginning. Each caste was ascribed special duties which corresponded to the aptitudes of the human types it was supposed to include. Mixed marriages were forbidden. This system, which took the principle of reincarnation into consideration, appeared even more sound and logical because at the time when it was estab- lished, the human types were still almost unmixed and had very few graduations. In modern language these four castes could be rod& de- fined as follows: First caste : sages, ministers of religion, leading scientists. Second caste : Knights, magistrates, Kings. Third caste : Industrialists and merchants. Fourth caste : Servants and employees. Whether one likes it or not, one has to admit that despite the confusion resulting from mixed marriages, the whole of humanity is naturally di- vided into these four castes even today. Though the democratization of our society makes the boundaries between castes appear nebulous, this is only a superficial impression. And although the leaders of revolutionary movements have always ignored it, the democratization which started in 1798, and grew more and more after 1848, has given rise to new caste- divisions which correspond to the demands of the approaching Era of the Holy Ghost. In 1722, Peter the Great had already given the signal for the abolition of all sorts of feudal, political, social and economic privileges through his famous ukase of the hierarchy of Rank. From then on, he organized Russian society on the basis of a principle which was new at 2. Luke xvi: 8. 3. This term means duty or, in a wider sense, service or career."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"that time, and which he defined thus: merit takesprecedence over ancestry-no longer an aristocracy of blood or wealth, but of service. Originally, the division of the Aryan race into four castes had a double aim: to orient men from the time of their birth, and because of their birth, towards a career which was by definition right for them, and to facilitate esoteric work for those who were drawn to it. Based on the idea of me- tempsychosis, it was believed that this caste system would bring souls to incarnate in environments which were the most suitable for the experience they would hold. Circumstances have changed since then. The present boundaries be- tween castes are no longer so rigid. This is because births are no longer 'canalized' by absolute rules as they once were, and also because the human Personality no longer corresponds exactly to the determined types: in the best cases the Personality is shaded, otherwise it is unbalanced or even anarchistic. The four castes still exist today, but only in potential. They are a projection into the still vague future of the four well-defined castes between which men 5, 6, and 7, who have acquired their Individuality, will be divided. It must be understood that man cannot organicalb change his gpe. He can maim it, which is what he generally does with ardour. Maimed like every- one else, the principal aim of the man who undertakes esoteric work is to know himself and to pull himself together. This final straightening out takes place after the man 4 has crossed the second Threshold; and the Tradi- tion says that it is within the framework ofa man's own me that the real 'I' can lead the Individuality to perfection and even to radiant beauty. L et us come back to the type of the Knight which we took as an example. If he surveys his failures and tries to get to the root of them, he will understand the main cause: the scale of values that exists in the environ- ment in which he works does not correspond to his own. While everyone around him hankers after worldly power, he is an anachronism who feels lost in these modern times, searching only for Truth ... Generally speaking, even though the man 2, who is born in the envir- onment 3 of our epoch, is inept for the practical struggle of everyday life, he has considerable potential for esoteric evolution, due to the constitu- tion of his psyche. By consciously working on the development of his intellectual centre-his emotional centre being already awake, and perhaps even somewhat developed-he more easily balances his Personality. This is an important thing to know. For the people destined to be the fore- runners of the New Era (which is that of the Holy Spirit) will be chosen from this group of highly cultivated men 2 who have attained a certain equilibrium by taking their intellectual development as far as possible. The position of the man 3 in ambience 3 does not give him the same advantages from the esoteric point of view. Of course, he has more op- portunities in practical everyday life than the man 2, but he does not have the same aptitude for balancing his Personality. He has to begin by devel- oping an emotional centre which is partially or entirely dormant. So he first has to awaken it. This awakening is naturally more difficult for the man 3 in ambience 3 than it is for the man 2 to develop his intellectual centre in the same environment. For neither in its form nor in its content does Religion offer anything constructive to the intellectual type, who is agnostic by nature. Besides, until now no institution has made provision for schools or universities where emotional aptitudes may be formed or scientifically developed. If a man 3 feels the need for emotional development, for lack of anything better he will be forced to work empirically. However, we can give him a valuable hint: human nature has an aptitude for being trained, and this can be profitably used to awaken the torpid emotional centre. With subtle and highly refined reasoning, the man 3 must in every circumstance imagine the reaction of the man 2 who is obedient to the call of his emotional centre. And he must by conscious effort react in the same way when not driven by emotion. It is a game. He will make mistakes and stumble many times, especially at the beginning. But if he takes the game seriously and makes it a permanent methodical exercise for all occasions, he will succeed in liberating his emotional centre from its state of torpor. He will then notice its spontaneous reactions and this first success will encourage him to continue this work. He must tirelessly persevere in this exercise of awakening until the emotional centre is completely aroused and quite ready for development. The man 3 can find that this condition is an advantage. Except for negative emotions, his emotional centre is not greatly sullied, as it is so often asleep. If afterwards during the course of these awakening exercises he takes care that this centre does not become stained by all sorts of considerations and, above all, is not used for false aims, the man can become like a little child4 whose emotional centre is awake although undeveloped and is neither deformed nor tarnished. T his brief analysis and the disclosure of certain rules are, of course, insufficient to tackle the vast and extremely complex problem posed 4. Matthew xviii: 3 189"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"at the beginning ofthis chapter. The way the emotional centre works the possibilities for its development are unknown to exterior man. We see this clearly in certain circumstances, during the course of criminal t~ for example: the best juries never manage to penetrate the depths of the human heart. The same thing happens during confession: even when the penitent is inspired by a sincere desire to tell the truth he does not manage to express all that is weighing on his heart. How can he lay bare his acts and find a motive for them when his under-developed and unbalanced Person- ality with its 987 'I's' is such a madhouse? When, after patient and sustained introspection, we penetrate further and further into the interior of our Personality, we discover little (1's' which are very different from each other in appearance and nature. First- ly, we observe that they are not all of the same age. In the legion of the 987 elements of the Personality there exist feminine (1's' in the men and mascu- line '1's' in the women: often these are numerous and sometimes even preponderant. During someone's life each little 'I' has its character and its role to play within the group. But in the majority of cases, these 'I's' do not in fact carry out their duty: a great number of them have fallen into a sleep bordering on lethargy; then the more active ones try to command the others without caring about their own assignments nor those of the '1's' they wish to dominate, nor the responsibilities to which the entire man is committed as a result of their actions. Lastly, happy events or unforeseen misfortunes, exterior shocks like bolts from the blue, further complicate an already tangled inner condition. This is when the azltotranqzlillixing mechanism comes into action and, with its help, man discovers a new unstable equilibrium - which will be broken again by new exterior or interior shocks, like a house of cards that topples over at the breath of a child. To tell the truth, as it is, the existence within us of this heterogeneous society oflittle 'I's' is absurd. Logically, it can only lead man to bankruptcy. The practice of introspection enables us to perceive the foreign elements in the composition of the human Personality; in a young man, for instance, it may lay bare little 'I's' impregnated with the scepticism of old men; conversely, in an older person it may reveal the 'I's' of an enthusiastic adolescent with a heart overflowing with faith, hope and love. We may also observe within ourselves the coexistence of diametrically opposed faults and qualities which normally should compensate each other or, at least mitigate each other. But this is not always the case, and one may find the cohabitation in the very same person of an avaricious 'I' when facing an insignificant expenditure and a prodigal 'I' when it is a question of spending large amounts. Although this existence of such contradictory '1's' at the same time is absurd, one comes across cases of this type more often than is commonly imagined. and can rials However, we must not draw hasty conclusions from this situation that we may observe in ourself by practicing introspection. Still less should one try to establish a false harmony in oneself by some direct or violent action. The result of such an act can only be the mutilation of the Personality, not its harmonization. It is necessary to look on the Personality as being mentally ill and, in order to obtain a positive result, we must act gradu- ally, methodically, circumspectly and, we repeat, with love and great pa- tience. The Personality is a Divinegift to us - the talent for which we are re~~onsible.~ I n order that these ideas may be firmly anchored in the reader's mind, it is not superfluous to take another quick look at the theory and practice that are attached to the process of the evolution of the Personality. Following conscious efforts of observation, of non-confluence, of inner non-considering, of outer considering, and of being permanently present in the self, etc, man begins to discern the 'B' influences. With the accu- mulation of the impressions that emanate from these influences, a magnetic centre begins to take shape within him. Once formed, this centre is situated between the lower emotional centre and the higher emotional centre: it is a new centre of consciousness. As it grows, it plays the role of an inter- mediary which little by little absorbs the lower emotional centre and is itself later absorbed by the higher emotional centre. At the same time, it progressively affirms its authority over the three lower centres of the Personality and, by that, over the 987 little 'I's': at this point it identifies itself with the higher emotional centre situated in the middle of the organ- ism of our psyche. Man thus attains the inner condition represented in the figure 24 (overleaf) which we discussed at greater length in the first volume of this work.' This is the diagram of the Individuality, the fruit of the second birth. As we can see, the sectors of the old lower emotional centre which are in- tegrated into the higher emotional centre do not totally disappear. The survival of the sectors of the lower emotional centre is represented by dotted lines, because the higher emotional centre, like the higher intellec- tual centre and the sexual centre, is indivisible. But these sectors are transfigured. According to an old initiatory formula: at the to~h of the philosopher's stone, the sword of steel becomes a sword of gold. It retains its form but can no longer serve as afgbting weapon. Transfigured and absorbed by the higher emotional centre, the six sectors of the lower emotional centre now 5. Matthew xxv: 25. 6. Ref. Vol.1, pp. 59-61."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"represent the heart of the newborn Individuality. Under the absolute authority of the higher emotional centre, which contains the real '1', they together ensure the direct and autonomous link with the lower intellectual centre on the one hand, and with the motor centre on the other. This is how the character of the Individuality is formed, which, after its birth, passes through successive stages of growth and development. One must note that the Individuality retains its essential innately positive traits - the predispositions7 - of the personality of the man 1, 2, or 3, purified in man 4, and born again for a new life in the man 5, 6, and 7. In the Individuality, as in the Personality of the exterior man, the link with the higher intellectual centre is established directly through the high- er emotional centre. But the sexual centre, which enjoyed its independence when in the Personality, is now directly linked with the higher emotional centre. The sexual centre does not act autonomously in the Individuality as it did in the Personality, so that its energy can no longer be usurped by the two lower centres that survive, the intellectual and the motor centre. Here, Love is unadulterated. This modification radically transforms man's sexual life after his second Birth, raising it to the level of the emotional life that from this time on is ruled by the real 'I'. This is the sublimation of sex. T o complete our picture, it is useful to give some indication of the changes that take place in the Personality when it becomes an Indi- viduality through union with the real 'I'. We have already seen that the Personality is made up of987 little 'I's-a figure that results from all the possible combinations of the eighteen sectors of the three lower centres. Now, in the Individuality, only two of these centres still have a certain degree of autonomy. Thus the number of I possible combinations is now based on twelve sectors, which are no longer multiplied by three but by two, enabling us to obtain the following formula: To these sixty-six developed, balanced and disciplined little 'I's' of the Individuality, we must also add the six sectors of the lower emotional I centre that are enveloped by the higher emotional centre. In this way, we reach the number seventy-two. This is a sacred number, and plays an important part in initiatory practices. After the tower of Babel, when humanity was no longer united, it was divided into seventy-two linguistic groups which comprised the totality of the peoples who inhabited the ( earth. None of them was mixed; they were all of pure stock and, among them, six races had a messianic vocation. The number seventy-two includes all possible shadings of the human types that reach the level of the Individuality. This is a simplification i compared to the 987 little 'I's' of the Personality but, in the sectors of the intellectual and motor centres, it is compensated by the penetration of radiation that comes from the higher emotional centre. Each little 'I' of the Individuality benefits from the harmonious co-operation of all the others; I this simplification of the system ofthe psyche is a result of its being raised to a higher plane. The sublimation of sex, so that its expression is in complete harmony with that of the real '1', transforms the emotional life of the Individuality to such an extent that it cannot be described in human language. In the , Tradition, this state is called Beatitade. 7. These predispositions (Gr. 'prolipseir') are referred to in the Pbiloblia and in a slightly different sense in, for example, Stoic philosophy. (Ed.)"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVIII 0 n the basis of the analysis of different types of deformation of the Personality we made in chapter XVI, in this chapter we will outline the ways of re-establishing a degree of equilibrium in the latter. An en- ergetic readjustment is indispensable for the one who wishes to take a serious part in esoteric work, the aim of which - as we know - is the complete growth and development of the Personality taken all the way to the second Birth. This leads us to consider the major problem of esoteric practice, one that is as important in the outer life as in the inner: this concerns negative emotions. We have pointed out more than once that these emotions are the means by which the great destructive force acts in man. It is not an exaggeration to say that negative emotions are mainly responsible for the fact that human beings age and die prematurely. To combat old age and death, one must combat the negative emotions in oneself. This postulate may surprise some; it may be even more surprising if we add that, when treated according to precise rules founded on a strenuous psychical discipline, these very same emotions, though harmful, can become an abundant source of the fine, active energies whose presence is necessary for the development of the Personality. P reparatory theoretical and practical study of esoteric science is abso- lutely essential before the reader will be able to grasp the Doctrine of negative emotions we are about to expound. First one mustjrmlygrasp the fundatlrentalidea that Faith, Hope and Knowledge (Gnosis) are consecutive stages in the progressive Revelation of Lwe, and that a deficiency or lack of revelation at the preceding stage prevents access to the revelation of the following stage. This means that without Faith in one's heart it is impossible to attain Hope in the esoteric sense of this word. And without one or the other one can never attain Gnosis, the living knowledge that makes Love accessible. In the Tradition's metaphorical language, the triad of Faith, Hope and Knowledge is called the triple-edged Sword, or the triangular raxor. The scriptures1 and the commentators of the first centuries of our era insist on the importance of negative emotions and on the attitude we 1. Luke vi: 28-32; Matthew v: 44-46"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"should take to them. They recommend a positive reaction and a joytul attitude towards people who are malicious towards us. For example, one reads: Bless those who curseyou,pray foryour enemies, fast for those wh~persecute_~ou.~ Love those who hateyou3 andyou willnot have any enemie~.~ If someone smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also5 andyou will be perfect.6 We might quote many other similar texts. The commentaries of the doctors of the CEcumenical Church also abound in exhortations of a si- milar nature. 7 However, these are generally seen simply as dogmatic precepts, so that we do not try to fathom their underlying meaning. It is in one way reason- able to react in this way: the patient swallows the medicine without bother- ing to learn its chemical content: what interests him is the effect it is known to produce. We also acknowledge in theory the beauty ofthe attitude preached in the Gospel, which is not to resist evil at the same time as rejecting it in practice as a political and social danger.* Some consider the gospel teaching to which we have just referred as evidence of a religious exaltation that transgresses the limits of common sense. For them, the latter instruction seems to be pure madness. Yet the precepts to love one's enemies and not to resist evil have their justification. We will see that they lead quite naturally to our recommendation not to flee from negative emotions. It is easy to find a reason for the confusion that usually takes place. Most of the time when dealing with facts and maxims concerning the esoteric domain, we pronounce judgments which can only be applied to external life. In other words, we apply arguments and maxims that apply to 'A' influences to the domain of the 'B' influences. This confusion is a result of the false belief that Jesus' words are 'simple' and so must be accessible to everyone. In consequence, everybody is supposed to be able to understand and even to criticize them. This misunderstanding has survived for cen- turies in spite of the warnings that authorities such as Origen, St Isaac the Syrian and others have handed down to us. It is true that, in order to respect the principle of hermetism adopted by the Tradition, especially . 2. Didache', I, 3. 3. Luke vi: 27, 35. 4. Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, VII 5. Matthew v: 39; Luke vi: 29 6. Didache', loc. cit 7. PhiLokafia, passim. 8. Matthew v: 39; Slavonic text: He npOTlIBbCX 3no~y; Vulgate: non resistere mafo; Greek text: p?j a'vrtarrjvai +@ noyp@. in Oriental Orthodoxy, these warnings were given in a sibylline form. This is why St Isaac the Syrian points out that: The Holy Scriptures say many things by using words in a different sense from their original meaning. Sometimes bodily attributes are applied to the soul, and conversely, attributes of the soul are applied to the body. The Scriptures do not make any distinction here. However, enlightened men under~tand.~ I n order to grasp the exact meaning of the Gospel commandments we have just quoted, one must first try to understand the exact nature of negative emotions such as: anger, jealousy, hate, slander, envy, insolence etc., which are expressed by violence. Now all human emotions, whatever their nature, negative or positive, and whether they are born of different movements in the psyche, haue one single movelnent ofthe sodas their basis. However paradoxical it may seem, it is Love which forms the one unique basis of all the variations of positive or negative emotions. To be more precise, let us say that there is, in fact, only onepure emotion; and this emotion, in its limpid purity, is Love. All the different emotions and feelings that man feels are composites; in mixing with pure Love their elements trouble it: in effect, the latter has the capacity of absorbing and dissolving considerations, attitudes, passions, impulses, etc., in itself, just as chemically pure water has the faculty of absorbing and dissolving salts ofdifferent natures. One result of this is that the variety of human feelings depends, in each particular case, quantita- tively and qualitatively, on what is admixed into the pure Love in which they are dissolved. The higher emotional centre is the organ which enables man to feel this pure and unique emotion called Love. This is why, when addressing the Disciples and not the masses, St Paul gave them this precept which is famous in the esoteric Tradition: try to attain .Love.*' The reader may now better understand of which Love the Apostle spoke, and the meaning of the context of this maxim, and why he crosses over to the problem of spiritualgifts immediately afterwards. It is obvious that the exterior man does not know and cannot have even an approximate idea of Love in its Divine purity. Even advanced disciples who are already on the Staircase are far from knowing this emotion in all its fullness, for the 'I' of the Personality, with its three lower centres, does not possess the organ which will enable them to feel it. To be able to feel this emotion is the attribute of the real 'I9, which expresses itself through the Individuality formed at the second Birth. This situation may be compared 9. St Isaac the Syrian: Sermon IV, 83. 10. I Corinthians xiv: 1. Literal trans. from the Slavonic text."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"to that of the child: the latter becomes attached to his mother only after his physical birth, once he has been separated from her. It is to the foremost Disciples, those who are on the Staircase, that St Paul's sentence is addressed; if they cannot attain Love before crossing the second Threshold, how can the exterior man have any idea of this Love, when he has not even crossed the first Threshold. I n the feelings accessible to the faithful who are on the Staircase to the Wq, Love is still mixed. Human nature itself is mixed; it faithfully reflects the content of the Mixtus Orbis of which it is a product and a part, Thus the complex structure of the personality - with the centres of the psyche subdivided into positive and negative parts -reflects the mixed nature of the outer and inner worlds of terrestrial man and enables him to perceive them in all their parts, a possibility which would be denied him without this. This is the deep meaning of the sacrifice through which Love, which is God, created the world: he allowed the defilement, but only in order to transmute it into an image of dazzling beauty. If, as we have seen, the atrophy of the negative part of the intellectual centre prevents man from having any doubts, it also partially blinds his intelligence and takes away his capacity for appreciation, criticism and comparison, etc. The same may be said for the emotional centre. Its negative semicircle is necessary to ensure its complete functioning: while the positive part responds to agreeable impressions coming from the outside or the inside, the negative part responds in the same way to disagreeable impressions. This is the normal role of the negative semicircle, which might be called its positive role. If the awakened and pure emotional centre were deprived of its negative part, the affective life would be impoverished and disor- iented. This situation could be compared to one in which we would be able to feel heat without being able to feel cold, or see light without being able to distinguish shadows. When it is awake and functioning normally, the negative part of the emotional centre is an organ in the psychological structure of the Personality which is just as indispensable as the positive part. When the emotional centre is plunged into deep sleep, as it is in the first stereotype described in chapter XVI, it dream. It dreams in the daytime, in the midst of activity, as well as at night. The emotional centre conceives dreams by using its innate capacity for creating images. By elaborating these while inspired by ideas from the intellectual centre, it can create images of grandeur to compensate for the failures or half-failures of life. Ifinspired by impulses from the motor centre, it imagines itselfmoving on the ground, on the seas or in the air. Under the influence of innate elements rising from preceding films it can relive these films in frag- ments. With the aid of impulses proceeding from the sexual centre via the motor centre, the emotional centre has erotic dreams which can seem entirely true. On the other hand, if it dreams with the pure and direct aid of the sexual centre it creates ideal images of its polar being, founded on the experience of its present life orprevious experiences. With the sexual centre's direct intervention the emotional centre can also create idealized images of living beings that the man has met, or who resemble his polar being. In the two latter cases, the positive part ofthe emotional centre functions fully and enables a man to meet in his dreams a pure and elevated feeling which he is incapable of experiencing in his life as an exterior man. Ac- cording to their different planes, these dreams can proclaim, predict or even be prophetic. This process explains the meaning of the prayer that is recommended to disciples in which they ask God to permit sleep to become awakening in Life. In the two cases where the emotional centre calls on the energy of the sexual centre in dreams without going through the motor centre, the intellectual centre, being asleep, does not interfere with the work of the emotional centre with doubt or criticism. As it enters the emotional centre the energy SI-12 accelerates its vibrations, and this enables it to transform this sexual energy into SOL-12, following a momentary intervention by the higher emotional centre. These few indications give a brief glimpse of the work of the lower emotional centre while it is still under-developed- but which the unba- lanced contemporary life of man can no longer anaesthetize or degrade, particularly when, as a faithful, he climbs the steps of the Staircase. L et us return to the problem of negative emotions. The special vibratory current that carries this sort of emotion passes through the negative part of the emotional centre. As we have already emphasized, negative emotions are born, grow and develop on a base of Love. This may seem paradoxical. It is easy to conceive that positive emotions are born of Love but it seems difficult to admit that, when one analyses the elements which compose it as in chemical analysis, Love is revealed as the constant foundation of negative emotions."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Negative emotions are complex. They are a mixture of different psychic elements which are alien to Love's simple yet subtle nature, yet are added to it. The coarseness ofthese elements is responsible for the negative nature of this kind of emotion. The added elements may proceed from the intellec- tual centre, when they take the form of considerations, combinations or calculations, etc., or from the motor centre, when they take the form of passions, attractions or antipathies that come from the 'I' of the body. A special movement of the motor centre usurps sexual energy and this feeds the intransigence and dynamism which together form one of the main characteristics of every negative emotion. N ormally the sexual centre acts under the effect of Love. Let us see what happens in the three centres of the psyche, that is, in the whole Personality, in the normal case where the sexual centre begins to move. As an example, we will take the case of ideal and complete love between two polar beings who have not progressed from an esoteric point of view, that is, a man and woman 1, 2 or 3. Life offers a whole scale of anomalies relating to this normal case that we are about to study. These are ascribable to two general causes: - The first corresponds to equal participation of the husband and wife in the process; but the intensity of this participation only partially involves the organism of their psyche; - The second involves a difference in their participation, when the psyche is totally involved in one partner and only partially involved in the other. In other words, one loves and the other lets himself or herself be loved. There are an almost infinite variety of special cases, for there is no other sector in man's mental (pychiqae) and physical life where he is exposed to so many real, and above all, imaginary influences, as in the domain of sexual life, which demands commitment and unreserved response before it can blossom fully. But in the average sexual life, one comes across a multitude of unhealthy deviations such as the call of blood, the preservation of the species, physical attraction, possessiveness,11 and consideration, all of which play an important role in our society - sufficient to explain the rarity of the only cases which may be considered truly normal, the union of polar beings. S exual energy is SI-12, the finest energy that our organism can draw from food. When the sexual centre begins to act to accomplish its main function, which is carnal love, it first makes use of the motor centre. Flooded by the extremely powerful energy SI-12, the motor centre re- acts. However it is not completely impregnated by this in a single in- stant. The energy SI-12 first penetrates its positive part by provoking a strong instinctive attraction towards the opposite sex. The condition of the psyche that results orients the whole Personality: as long as the energy SI-12 acts normally, the 987 little I's unite and are directed towards the same goal. This phenomenon may be compared to the orientation of the molecules in the core of an electro-magnet when a current passes through it. Then the energy SI-12 penetrates the negative part of the motor centre and awakens it. This centre then leads the 'I' of the body to the carnal act. Up to this point the process is common to men and animals. It develops no further in the latter, and the same goes for the majority of human beings. The effects of the carnal act are then limited to physical pleasure and procreation. These limitations in men are due to the intervention of the General Law, which sees to it that the first impulse given to the sexual centre at the call of Love is measured and does not exceed a necessaty and saficient level to satisfy the ends that it is its task to fulfil. The motor centre then begins to act not always having sufficient energy at its disposal to produce the tension that would reorient the organism of the psyche in its totalig. 0 n the contrary, in the case of a total love or the love of polar beings, the call of Love makes the sexual centre vibrate incomparably more powerfully and produces a much larger quantity of energy SI-12 than the motor centre can contain. When it is saturated, this energy overflows. The excess then spreads into the two other centres, the intellectual and the emotional, where the energy SI-12 penetrates the motor sectors and im- prints on them a vibratory movement corresponding to its own rhythm. A s long as the energy SI-12 lasts, the very rapid vibration of the two motor sectors of the intellectual centre deeply transforms the con- dition and functional characteristics of the four other sectors of this centre. 11. John i: 13. 200"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"One may remember that this normally works with energy 48, whlcn imprints a relatively slow rhythm on it. Drawn by the extremely rapid frequency of the energy SI-12, the intellectual centre vibrates much more rapidly than normally, and as long as this energy makes itself felt this centre loses its thoughtful, reflective, calculating and agnostic nature: worries, doubts and other preoccupations are temporarily relegated to the back- ground of waking consciousness. Such a radical transformation can, how- ever, take place only in the case of polar beings, when Love's call and the impulse from the sexual centre are strong and pure. If this is not the case, the transformation will only be partial; the critical spirit, always the last to be effaced, will survive. Men and women commonly fall into moral pros- titution in its infinitely varied shadings because their worries and calcula- tions, emanating from the intellectual centre, are not stifled. When the call of Love is limited, the intellectual centre is not involved in the amorous process, and then the head remains cool. Instead of completely dominating the Personality, the sexual centre remains partly subject to its normal tendencies. This happens much more often than one might think. In- deed, it is no exaggeration to state that the great majority of human beings do not for a moment imagine that higher levels of carnal love exist. In the normal case that we have taken as an example, the vibration SI-12 awakens a vivid erotic imagination in the intellectual centre, freeing it of all worries. For one moment, it concentrates only on the game of love, in which its positive and negative parts vibrate together in harmony with the motor centre and with its own rhythm accelerated by the inflow of sexual energy. L et us now see what happens in the motor sectors of the emotional centre following this abundant production of fine, pure energy SI-12. It reacts quite differently from the intellectual centre. We must remember that in the exterior man the emotional centre does not work with the Hydrogen 12 which should normally nourish it, but with the Hydrogen 24 proper to the motor centre. The overflow of the energy SI-12 into the motor sectors of the emotional centre provokes a strong resonance in the other sectors of this centre - a resonance which can produce the two following phenomena: - the intellectual sectors of the emotional centre engage in a love- game led by the intellectual centre in harmony with the motor centre; the heart is then flooded by an influx of tenderness which is of an incomparably higher level than that to which it is used when it is only nourished with energy 24; - if the call of the energy SI-12 coming from the motor sectors of the emotional centre is sufficiently intense and pure, a momentary flash of the consciousness of the real 'I' mq be felt. This is produced in the following manner: the influx of tenderness due to the energy SI- 12 opens up communication with the higher emotional centre, from where a wave of energy SOL-12 from the higher octave flows to meet the SI-12 with which the motor sectors of the lower emotional centre are infused. Then, by induction, the energy SI-12 is subject to transmutation and can become SOL-12. When this happens, the organism receives an abundant influx of new energy. Even if only for a few moments, the couple taste this higher Divine condition which is Beatitude, a taste which leaves a feeling of re- laxation and ineffable peace in its wake. The possibility of acceding to a higher plane in the act of carnal love explains why marriage - in which the twain shall be bat one j'?esh12 - is included among the seven sacraments (mysteries in Orthodoxy) of the Christian Canon. This act carries in it the germ of the pure emotion that is Divine Love. If the couple reach this state under the impulses of the Absolute 111, through this mystery they attain the radiation of the Abso- lute 11. Then one step will be made in the direction of the great Return. S chematically, this shows the working of the three psychic centres in theirpositive and normal reaction to the call of the sexual centre, whose activity involves the couple in an act of total and harmonious love, which is the case forpolar beings. Indeed, the energy SI-12 has the faculty of envel- oping and dissolving the energies that come from the three centres of the Personality, and this will for an instant communicate a strong and harmo- nious vibration to the whole of the latter. This harmonious participation of the three centres in the accomplishment of the love-game can be compared to the playing of an orchestra composed of competent musicians and led by a talented conductor. 12. Matthew xix: 5; Genesis ii: 24; Mark x: 8; I Corinthians vi: 16; Ephesians v: 31; Slavonic text: E ~YAYT ABOe BO nnOTb emmy; Greek Text: ~ai ioovrar oi 660 cis odp~a CLiav ;Vulgate: cruniduo in carnc nna. It is the indispensable condition for the appearance of the Androgyne."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"III ( 7) Y et if this orchestra lacks direction, it will only produce a cacophony with its instruments. This is the case with couples who are not in harmony, and with whom the process functions the other way round: the sexual centre then turns in the opposite direction to normal and provokes abnormal sexuality and the birth of negative emotions. Thus, as we have said already, negative emotion has Love as a basis; otherwise it would not be an emotion. To this base are added, in varying proportions, elements which, although they are oriented in the opposite direction, are analogous to those which exist in the case of a normal love. Consequently, negative emotions have the effect of inducing a repulsion instead of provoking an attraction as in the case of positive emotions. Furthermore, their dynamic nature makes even the most phlegmatic man, when he is under their influence, want to act and thus express his agitated condition by violent words or deeds. The impressions that give rise to the negative emotions in us are only too well-known for us to enter into a detailed description of them. Our own experience enables us to fill in the gaps. The important thing is to grasp the process of their formation in us. This knowledge should enable us to reverse the effects and to transform their destructiveness into an esoteric benefit. This is expressed in the proverb that says: 'There is only one step between hate and love.' We have said that every negative emotion is composite. Pure negative emotion does not exist. But this mixture can only be produced and endure if it is being stirred up by some passion. It is like water which dissolves certain salts only when brought to a high temperature. The negative emotion is born of a violent fit of passion, when one can be overcome by hate, jealousy, anger, etc. By the reversal of the mechanism of the psyche we described in the case of harmonious love-game, the negative emotion usurps the energy SI-12 of the sexual centre, that is, the energy of carnal love, in order to manifest itself. The more violent the negative emotion expressed or suffered, the greater the quantity of energy SI-12 utilized. As in the positive case, this energy spreads over the whole of the motor centre and in the same way, penetrates the motor sectors of the intellectual and emotional centres by impregnating them. As long as the vibration from the motor centre, or from man's animal instinct, continues, the motor sectors of the two other centres vibrate negatively: a state of profound conftuence is the result. Here we are dealing with an essential point: the mechanist^ of negative emotions can function on4 in this state of deep confience. Driven by a shock or a passion, man loses his inner peace and falls immediately into the state of confluence that favours the birth and development of negative emotions. Generally, after a certain time, the negative emotion progressively loses its energy and is finally extinguished without conscious effort. We must add that once he has fallen into a state of confluence, man can get rid of the negative emotion only by exhausting the energies that it has brought to the surface. And the commotion that results does not disappear immediately. Negative emotions disturb the whole organism of the psyche, upset the Personality, and cause considerable loss of the finest and most precious energies which will be dragged into the movement. Man then needs time to rebuild these reserves of fine energies. A diametrically opposite effect is produced if at the moment when negative emotions arise in him, the subject remains calm and does I not mechanically fall into a state of conflgence. I Let us study the case of negative emotions that arise in us. Although I irritation may build up over weeks, months or sometimes years, its explo- sion is always instantaneous. In other words, the negative emotion erupts and takes dynamic form in a very short time; in one or two seconds it rises I in someone and overflows, putting them into a state of profound mechan- ical confluence. Finally, it will be exteriorized in words or actions. I Here we are brought back to the Doctrine ofthe Present. If, by persistent introspection, the subject manages to observe the rise of the negative emo- tion in himself immediately after its birth, that is, while the limits ofthe slot in his individlual Present have not been crossed in thepassing of time, it is possible for him to disassociate the components of this emotion. Introspective obser- vation brightens our inner being just like a streetlamp, and negative emotions can only be formed and begin to act in the inner darkness which characterizes the state of confluence. The light projected by constatation within the limits of the Present disassociates the negative emotions, and the passions which gave rise to them then fall back into a latent state. But constatation has yet another effect that is of primary importance: the immediate disassociation of the components which constitute the negative emotion liberates the energy SI-12 which the passions had drawn into the motor centre; a result of constatation is that this is automatically concen- trated in the emotional centre which it then sets in motion. We know that normal the intensive work of this centre is carried out with the aid of fine energy of the 12th degree. A victory over negative emotion brings an inflow of joy into the lower emotional centre. This joy is an expression of the abundance of the energy SI-12 released by constatation. This latter I"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"makes the lower emotional centre vibrate at the rapid rhythm that is normal to it, and this enables the establishment of instantaneous contact with the higher emotional centre and triggers the release of a current of energy SOL-12 from the latter. This indicates that, correctly practised through introspection and effective within the limits of the individual Present, constatation enables man to win a total victory. The inflow of higher joy that the current of energy SOL-12 liberates can then transmute the energy SI-12 freed from the mixture into SOL-12 by indzfction. The duration of the contact between the lower and higher emotional centres established by this can then be prolonged. It is obvious that this possibility only exists for the disciple who, after having crossed the first Threshold, perseveres in climbing the Staircase, when he possesses a magnetic centre in formation. Each victory over a negative emotion accelerates the formation of this centre. Jesus' redoubt- able words: for to him that bath, to him shall begiven; and he that bath not, from him shallbe taken even that which he bathT3 refer to this possibility of victory, to the efforts that it calls forth, and to its effects. T he factors we have just described explain the attitude towards nega- tive emotions adopted in the scriptures and by the Tradition. This attitude emphasizes the two following points: - without the appearance of the negative emotion, the energy SI-12 is not drawn in by the motor centre. It remains in the sexual centre to be used for the latter's needs; - without a victory over this very same emotion, man cannot feel the joy that is provoked by a current of energy SOL-12 coming from the higher emotional centre; and without this current, the energy SI-12 cannot be transmuted into SOL-12 as it is first drawn in by the appearance of the negative emotion, then liberated by intro- spective constatation within the limits ofthe individzfalpresent. The more violent the negative emotion, the greater the quantity of energy SI-12 drawn in, which can be transmuted into SOL-12 in case of victory. 13. Mark iv: 25; cf. also Matthew xiii: 12; xxv; 29; Luke viii: 18; xix: 26. 206 By carrying out this work with all the sincerity of which he is capable, the neophyte can reach thepath of Access which will lead him towards the Wq. In this way he will put off the old man, the slave of his passions, and will put on the new man which is renewed in Knowledge after the image of Him that created him.14 We have just studied the negative emotions which are born in us. But as he advances up the Staircase, the neophyte will find that the times when he feels a negative emotion arising within him become more and more rare. The energy SI-12 then remains asleep in the sexual centre, since the ab- sence of passions no longer calls it towards the lower centres where it may be used. It is at this point of his evolution that the neophyte will find the obvious utility ofthose who are hostile to him. As long as he is on the Staircase it is in insults, hate, jealousy, treachery and the contempt of other men that the faithful finds the elements which are necessary for him to awaken his emotional centre. By dominating the mechanical reactions that the re- proaches and attacks of others may produce in him, someone who strug- gles between the two Thresholds separates and rejects the elements which are parasites on the fine energy mobilized by negative emotions. We repeat: it is this energy which, having become available, allows the establishment of a contact with the higher emotional centre and accelerates the growth and the development ofthe magnetic centre. The faithfdfinds in this struggle the source of energy that is indispensable to him in order to progress. He will then understand that he can and must love his enemies and bless those who curse him.'' 14. Colossians iii: 9-10. 15. Matthew v: 44; Luke vi: 22."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIX I n the previous chapter we pointed out that the higher the faithfulclimbs on the Staircase, the more rare are the occasions on which negative emotions arise in him by his own initiative. This is comprehensible. With regular introspection and inner constatation he will progressively gain knowledge of himself, that is, of the structure of his Personality and the way it functions. The opinion that 'Knowledge is Strength', expressed at the time of the first industrial revolution, is wholly applicable to the inner revolution which takes place in man after introspection. A slave of his passions, of his instincts, and so of his negative emotions, he had until yesterday always managed to justify himself by using commonly accepted slogans as well as by remarking that his behaviour was simply human and normal. Now the faithfulbegins to disapprove of these emotions; he begins to realize that he is a slave and to understand that the negative emotions, which are an effect of the General Law, seek to keep him in his primitive state and to hold him in his place, for the good of the whole, but to the detriment of his personal interests. This attitude becomes firmer in spite of all the seductive or frightening appearances that the mirage of life, con- stituted of all the 'A' influences, faces him with. This first knowledge-the beginning of the higher knowledge which is the Gnosis of St Paul, Clement of Alexandria and the other authors of the early centuries- brings Power to the faithful. Above all it appears to him in the form of a mastery of the movements of his psyche. Of course this does not happen immediately; he has to pay a high ransom in order to be freed from this slavery. And the ransom can be raised only at the price of sustained labour that is generally long and hard. However, with conscious and prolonged efforts of introspective constatation, the faithfulwho burns with Faith and perseveres in climbing the Staircase will find that he is more and more detached from the negative emotions which, under the dominion of the General Law, have always tended to appear in him. T he first rudiments ofgnosis, the higher knowledge andpractice which give one mastery of oneself, progressively bring the innerpeace which is the first serious result of the efforts made. This inner peace, which the faithfulshould cultivate by any means, is the indispensable condition that will enable him to collect all his energies so"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"that he will be able to progress on the Staircase, and it is this same inner peace that will save him from falling. However, when we cultivate this inner peace, our opportunities for profitably exploiting the negative emotions born in us, so as to obtain fine energies, become very scarce. Then there remains only one other source, that of negative emotions aroused by shocks from outside us. This kind of shock will never be lacking for those who work in the world.* Indeed, to the General Law someone who 'moves' looks like a fugitive from collective work, and nature takes immediate steps-a whole series of appropriate measures -to make the rebel fall back into line. Then begins the struggle, the great struggle, the Invisible Combat on whose outcome the fate of the Knight of christ2 depends. This uninter- rupted combat lasts the whole length of the Staircase, and the faithfzll does not obtain his final victory until after the last trials, when he finds himselfin front of the second Threshold. All along the way, however, progress is ensured bypartial victories over this or that passion, over the tendency to sleep, over violent shocks or scandals coming from outside or even from inside him. The struggle is painful, especially because one does not recognize the enety until after one has been hit; his approach is always masked in infinitely varied ways: considerations, seductions, a desire to be useful or agreeable, condescen- sions, noble attitudes, etc. Often the Knight is defeated because he was serving the Devil with all his heart while sincerely but mistakenly believ- ing that he was serving Christ. But whoever commits himself on this field of battle will still find help. It comes to him from two sides: from the depths of his being, and from outside him. In the first case, it is his absolute sincerity towards himself and the purity of the faith with which his heart is aflame. By definition, faith is blind, since it is as certain of the invisible as ofthe visible. As the invisible is unknown by definition, the most ardent faith can be sincerely mistaken. The example of St Paul is sufficient proof of this. But this same example shows that, just by its existence, the sincerity of faith calls forth Love, and so it draws out a correction of what is admittedly in error from the deepest depths of the one who feels it. This is the meaning of the revelation that the future prince of Apostles received on the road to Damascus. As for outside aid, this comes from the effects of the law which applies to every action. We have defined this law more than once by this formula: tendencies accentzlate. It is popularly known, and in many countries it appears in common parlance in the maxim: on4 the first step cozmts. These two formulae express the same law, and apply algebraically, that is, in a positive or negative sense. In terms of the moral effort that must be made, it is no 1. It is quite different in monastic practice. 2. Traditional term. less difficult to steal for the first time, for example, than to practice an unaccustomed virtue. Repeated action (in this instance, partial victories over negative emotions of the same nature) creates a habit, a force of inertia. Even then, before crossing the second Threshold we can never be sure we will not fall into the same snare again, for one's watchfulness is quickly exhausted when faced with simultaneous and reiterated attacks. But the fall will be less and less painful and the erasure of its effects less and less difficult. What is more, each partial victory augments the reserve of fine energies and so strengthens the Knight's strength in the battle. But here again, he must be particularly vigilant not to spend the reserve as fast as he accu- mulates it. After each victory, he must remember that the General Law automatically acts in varied ways to steal from him the surplus-relative to the 'bourgeois' level - of the fine energies he has won, and which, if rationally utilized, will allow him to make one more step forward out of the zone of influence of this fundamental law which, in this situa- tion, is hostile to him. In the course of this Invisible Combat, a particular passion, the same mirage, loses its power over the victor once he has overcome it once, twice or more times. So while the Knight advances on the Staircase his inner peace becomes more and more complete and unalterable. He will see his 'assailants' waver and retreat, one by one. At this time the second source of fine energies that the faithfzll needs so much in order to advance is cut off. This source is the result of the trans- mutation of negative emotions aroused by shocks from outside him. Again, in someone who has crossed the first Threshold and struggles to climb the Staircase with his heart burning with faith, the source of energies from the negative emotions forming inside him dries up at the same time. It then becomes a question of knowing how and where Christ's Knight can find new sources of fine energies, once he has established a steady and permanent peace within himself and has thus become unmovable by inner or outer shocks. These sources will open up for him but, we must repeat, only on con- dition that the inner peace he has obtained becomes firm and unshakeable. Having reached this point in our study, the enlightened reader will understand that this inner peace can be obtained only by the fwion to which we referred in the first volume. This logically leads us on to examine this phenomenon and technique which can enable us to carry out this fusion in ourselves in greater depth."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"H ere we will digress a little in order to clear up an important question which must have arisen in the reader's mind. To postulate of the mastery of the negative emotions is well founded, as has been demon- strated above, and this gives rise to the following question: in these con- ditions, what is their usefulness in the general economy of our Mixtus Orbis? From what has been said, the reader may have the impression that negative emotions are simply one of the instruments by which the General Law keeps man in his place. Here, it is necessary to make a distinction, because the action of negative emotions has not one role but two. Their action becomes destructive for those who are close to the first Threshold, and even more for those who, having crossed it, are progressing on the Staircase. We have already men- tioned that as far as the General Law is concerned they are potential or confirmed 'fugitives.' For them, negative emotions represent one of the factors that can make them lose ground, and this is a danger against which the faithful should fight with all his strength. But this is the special case of someone who takes part in esoteric work, and it is rather uncommon. So the question is to learn the significance of these negative emotions when they invade people who are satisfied with themselves and perhaps even with their fate, who not only do not dream of any esoteric evolution, but who have no idea of the General Law, of its action, or that it is possible to escape from its clutches. These are docile, perfect subjects of the GeneralLaw, and their kind forms the greater part of the human species. Negative emotions have numerous meanings and play countless roles that largely extend beyond the boundaries of our Mixtw Orbis. We will try to determine their place within the framework of the note LA of organic life on Earth, especially in its two principal aspects: thepersonalaspect and the collective one. In both these cases the role of negative emotions is not really negatiz~e, although their direct effects are always destructive: damaging the indivi- dual's health, provoking discord in families, and giving the human masses impulses that push them to excesses: to revolts, wars or revolutions. In the individual case, thepositive effects of negative emotions lies in the fact that they serve as awakening alarms. Their dynamism communicates impulses to the individual which force him to act. It is the energy SI-12 stored up by the motor centre which mixes with the energy of one or more passions-which have the heavier density of 24-to give birth to negative emotions. Afterwards, in this mixed state, it penetrates the motor sectors of the two other centres and makes them vibrate. The emotional centre then vibrates in a violent way. The same mixture of energies gives the intellectual centre an inventive but always calculating orientation, render- ing it cunning and capable of all kinds of lies. In this way the organism of man's psyche comes out of its somnolent mental state but, uncultured from the esoteric point of view, it automa- tically or even voluntari& falls back into the same state whenever there is a lack of external impulses. It takes life in a spirit of an eternal holiday. N egative emotions could be said to form a valid common denominator for all human beings and human groups without distinction of race, caste, sex or religion. They give birth to a common language which can be understood by all, even by animals. Wars and revolutions are certainly calamities for the generations that suffer them, but ancient and modern History show us that they provoke a recrudescence of human activity not only on the battlefields but also in the chancelleries and in the silent studies of philosophers and men of letters, as well as in the laboratories and factories. And it is from that activity, provoked if not imposed by the calamities of wars, that marvels are born for the following generations. This is one indirect but clearly positive effect of negative emotions. We may even add that, without negative emotions, the door onto the path of access to evolution would be closed to individuals as well as to human groups. This digression having come to an end, let us continue our examination of the phenomenon of fusion. T he process which leads to fusion must be attentively observed during its development and subjected at eve9 moment to the practice of con- statation in a state of lucidpresence in oneself. The whole process may take many years. It includes five successive stages:"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE FIVE STAGES OF FUSION FIRST STAGE. - Introspection. Constatation. This consists of sustained introspective observation having as its object all the little I's forming the Personality, which are the filings of which we spoke in the first volume of this work. This observation faces us with different kinds of representation: abstract ideas, animated ideas, colour- less or coloured images, vegetable and animal living beings, human images. All this is in a cold, temperate or hot atmosphere. In this work, the essential thing is to observe the elements which to- gether form our provisional 'I', that of our unfinished personality. Then we must constate that each of these is in fact a particle of our 'I' as we are before the first Threshold. We repeat that if it is to prove fruitful, this entire process must be subjected to sustained constatation from the first stage right up to its happy ending. Once the faithful has become familiar with the spectacle of his Person- ality during persistent introspection, he must try to discover which little I's or groups of little I's have a tendency to wish to occupy the foreground of the scene. It is important to know them. It is also useful to know that these little I'swhich always tend to play the main role and which, because of this, serve as guides in the whole of the Personality, are sometimes masked_lfrom the observer as a result of lying to oneself and of hypocrisy. Cz/ Generally speaking, every Personality is deformed; the sense and the degree of the deformation are individual, but the greater the deformation the more of the little I's are behind the mask. It is important to know this, as they mwt be unmasked in the first stage of the work. Otherwise the fusion can never take place properly and completely, which is a necessary con- dition for it to be effective. SECOND STAGE. - d4ctive inner peace. Outer or inner circumstances provoke conflicts in us between I's of divergent tendencies - faithfully reflecting the world of 'A' influences. Each conflict produces a disagreeable sensation of inner friction. At this moment it is necessary to be watchful. Knowing that feeble, partial or intermittent constatation is not sufficient to give results, one must be activefy present in oneself and observe the process while, at the same time resolutely detaching oneself from it. Otherwise, if we merge into or take part in the conflict, even momentarily or partially, the friction cannot be turned to our advantage. On the contrary, when we are dissolved in it we lose our energies instead of preserving and accumulating them. One of John Climacus' maxims may be applied to this work in particular; it says that: the true wise man is he who knows how to turn evevthing to his advantage.3 For this, it is necessary to bepresent at the very moment when the friction is born; the result is then positive, and fine energies are pro- duced. Their quantity depends on the intensity of the friction, that is, on the inward conflict or conflicts, as well as on the degree of one's presence in oneself. Their quality depends on the centre which is acting. When properly treated with the aid of constatation whilepresent in oneself, the friction can liberate fine energies of a valency between indexes 96 and 12. We are generally lacking in all these energies. The group of energies 96 acts on the complex process of respiration whose rhythm, in its turn, depends on the impressions that provoke positive or negative emotions in us. Positive emotions provoke the acceleration of the heartbeat and, more important, of the breath.4 Conversely, negative emotions act directly on the respiration and, through it, on the heart. This is why one quite rightly says: he breathes anger, hate, etc. When angry, we consume a great deal of energy 96 in one stroke: it takes our breath away. Ifwe master our anger on the spot, we liberate the energy SI-12 which, as already explained, enters the emotional and intellectual centres in abundance. A flood of well-being and sweetness spreads through us then; the breath becomes normal and deep, the vibration of the centres is accelerated and this in turn provokes increased activity of the energies belonging to group 96, which leads to intensified transmutation of energies on all three scales of nutrition. A Practical Pointer. The faithful who commits himself to esoteric work while continuing to live in the world invariably provokes the animosity of those around him. Several texts in the Gospel refer to this law. It is sufficient to know the verse where it is said that man's greatest foes are those of his own house- hold.= However, an even greater enemy of man is certainly himself, pre- cisely because of his unconditional attachment to those 'of his own household.' This is why Jesus said: if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters, yea, and his own soul6 also, he cannot be ttzy disciple.' 3. Or profit. (Ed.) 4. At the same time certain positive emotions, such as awe, have an opposite effect of slowing the breathing and in prayer this effect leads to what is known as 'secret breathing'. (Ed.) 5. Matthew x: 36. 6. After the Slavonic text; Psyche, in the Greek text; anima of the Vulgate; fge in the Louis Segond version (French) and in the King James' revised version. Here it is a reference to the Personality. -(and hence is consistent with the translated use of 'soul' throughout Gnosis. (Ed.)) 7. Luke xiv: 26"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"This is the meaning of the other words Jesus pronounced: think noz znar 1 am come to sendpeace on earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword.' One can feel that here it is a question of the disciple's inner attitude towards the people that surround him, that is, inner non-consideration. On the other hand, we are generally deficient in outer consideration. Thus, when we manage to transform negative emotions into positive, acquiring inner peace and joy in the process, we must not show this victory over ourselves to the person who provoked the wave of anger in us, as it will only increase the offender's rage. THIRD STAGE. - Warmth. We must not take this word as merely symbolic. Real heat is born in us when the inward friction becomes sufficiently intense and is used ration- ally. It happens in exactly the same way as where heat is produced when two bits of dry wood are rubbed together. Of course, for this one must have dry wood. The attentive reader will understand the esoteric meaning of these words. When we feel this heat we can be sure that we are on the right track. The sweetness it brings never satiates us. We have seen that this heat can come from the proper use of circum- stances; but it can also be provoked by certain prayers. The friction then comes in the middle of an act ofpresence, of the confrontation of the 'I' of our Personality, in its lowliness and its weakness, with the Thou of God's infinity. The power ofthe prayer depends on the intensity of feeling which is born of this opposition and which is felt as a result of the double nature of the emotional centre. Pride, even the smallest trace of it, renders this confrontation ino erative. The well-known traditional maxim says: God resisteth the prod 8 The heat is produced by the feeling which is born of this confrontation, and not by the words of the prayer. ~eside~;'i&this case, the prayer must be short so that the heart can recite it unceasingly, inwardly, and can then preserve its inmost meaning while abandoning its form and the words of which it is composed. If one succeeds in this, the heart experiences an ineffable transport of joy, which is something we should try very' hard to obtain. A Practical Pointer. We reach this progressively. Firstly, we must recite the prayer aloud; then we form the words with our lips without producing any sound and, lastly, we say it in spirit. The alert reader will understand the meaning of 8. Matthew x: 34 9. Proverbs ii: 34; James, iv: 6; Luke xiv: 11; I Peter 5: 5. this method. Its application is individual and is one of the group of daily exercises which form the Pravilo (Rule). In Orthodox monastic practice they use theJesus Prayer to this end. It is repeated as follows: Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God Have mercy on me, a sinner! In monasteries and convents it is repeated ten or even twenty thousand times a day. Those who work in the world are recommended to recite this prayer in series each of twelve times, that is, three times as written above, then repeated four times. We should repeat from one to four recitations a day in this way. FOURTH STAGE. - Fire. The first three stages of fasion require sustained effort. The last two are of a spontaneous nature. The heart sets itself aflame when the friction liber- ates sufficiently strong heat, as is the case with two pieces of dry wood. This is the mystical Fire. From there, it spreads through the veins. A traditional maxim refers to this subject in the following words: When thefire barns in the blood, the very composition Dfthe nervoas ystem changes in essence. And the blood becomes 'blue'. At this stage, the wonder-struck seeker will see in his own depths the image of his real 'I', a brilliant ray of the 'I' of his Lord. In the Gospel according to St Thomas, which was discovered recently, the following allusion is made to this: Let him who seeh, not cease seeking until he finds, and when he finds, he will be troubled, and when he has been trodled, he will marvel and he will reign over ~l1.l' To reign over All. The reader will understand that this means identifica- tion with one's real 'I', which is a fragment of the Lord's 'I' which reigns over the Universe. FIFTH STAGE. - Fusion. The fusion takes place in different ways but always begins from the emotional centre, under the influence of an intense emotion cultivated through continuous efforts,'' or of a sudden emotion as in the case of the good thief on the cross, or following a long accumulation of diverse emotions oriented in the same direction. The nature of the fasion is, there- fore, strictly individual. It can be the result ofa sacrifice: that of the soldier who sacrifices himself for his country, for example. Did not Jesus say that there was no greater love than that of someone who sacrifices his soul1* for 10. Gorpcl acmrding to St. Thomar, op. cit., Log. 2, p. 3. 11. For this, the Tradition says that it is necessary toforce ones@ 12. After the Slavonic text; psyche in Greek. It refers to the Personality."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"his friends.I3 It can also happen in the wake of any other intense mam- festation of true Love. Love, therefore, is the common element in all the processes which lead to positive fusion. In reality it is Love, and Love alone, which sets the heart aflame while it leaves the head cool. The fusion effected in this way has a definite nature. FuJion can also take place under the influence of a strong negative emo- tion, the fear of sin, for example. But in this case it is not and cannc total. Its quality is hybrid and its effect is insufficient. If, later on, the man becomes conscious of this insufficiency, and : persists in his desire to attain a correct and perfect total fusion, he is first called upon to destroy his partial fdon and then to start all over again from nothing. But this destruction can only be made at the price of considerable suffering. Once he is conscious of the fact that the filsion is defective, the man must force himself to destroy it as soon as possible. This is all the more difficult because the imperfect fgfion is the result of a long accumulation of emotions oriented in a wrong direction. If the defective fusion is destroyed, at the very moment of its destruction the man can appropriate and turn to his profit all the power of the emotions with the effects of which he had managed to create a partial or negative fusion. In this case, as in the struggle against negative emotions, the positive effect remains when the pernicious effects of the negative fgfion have been effaced. However, there is one condition for this: the destruction must be accompanied by the practice of constatation while in an active state of presence in oneself. We should also note that besides all kinds of partial or negative fusion, there also exist ciytalliqations. These are always incomplete and localized. But one must not confuse them with what is, in the esoteric sense, human nature. The latter could be compared to a viscous mass in a liquid; it can show one or several points of crystallization which have been obtained mechanically. Often, this comes and grows with age, especially in people who are hardly interested in what oversteps the limits of the immediate in space and time. Then the prudent become avaricious and the dictatorial become intractable. Mental sloth augments with age, so that man becomes incapable of having an original thought; from then on he lives with the thoughts of others which, in their turn, become progressively crystallized in him, losing all their healthy versatility. These phenomena are sometimes also to be found in the young. They are signs of premature aging. 13. John xv: 13. I T hese are the different aspects of the process of fusion that we have briefly studied during the five stages of its realization.

We have already studied the transformations which take place in the relationship between man's Personality and his real (I' once he acquires esoteric knowledge orgnosis.l But this time we will also take the (I' of the body into consideration and follow the combined evolution of the three I's: of the body, of the Personality, and the real (I', before and after the second Birth, the birth of the Individualit_y. At the outset the situation can be represented by the following diagram2: Personality Real 'I' FIG. 25 With the introduction of the (I' of the body, the diagram looks like this: 'I' of the body Personality Real 'I' (The arrows indicate the direction in which authority is exercised in the normal daily life of human beings.)

In other words, the 'I' of the Personality is active ir relation to the real 'I'. However, in certain grave situations the real 'I imposes itself on the generally dormant positive part of the lower emo- tional centre, awakens it momentarily, and then sends warnings through it to the Personality. But very often these alarms are not heeded. As for the 'I' of the body, in the average healthy adult this is strongly developed. Except in relatively rare cases of shock or from sudden unexpected impressions, the body knows perfectly well what it needs for its sustenance, as well as for its rest, for pleasure, and for all its desires. The Personality lives in the body and expresses itself through its organs. Because of this, the 'I' of the Personality depends on the 'I' of the body for the greater part of its manifestations. In its turn, the real 'I' reveals itself through the Personality. This is why in life the exterior man largely de- pends on it. Through it, to a second degree, he also depends on the 'I' of the body. Indeed, a wave of fever or a toothache can make the exterior man momentarily lose his generous ideas and all his spirituality. As the previous diagram shows, everything is interdependent. However, each of these three 1's has its rules and its own aims and, to attain these latter, each employs the good ofices of the Personality. Thus, when the 'I' of the body finds that the moment has arrived for it to eat, the Personality, at its instance, takes all the necessary measures: the purchase, preparation and absorption of food. In this example, the 'I' of the body and the 'I' of the Personality change their respective positions several times, becoming dominant or subordinate by turns. If we take the trouble to note the whole procedure that ends with dinner, we will see that this reversal of (+) and (-) signs intervenes dozens of times, and that on the whole the Personality serves the 'I' of the body. Though in a much less varied manner, the signs also change in the relationship between the Personality of the exterior man and his real 'I'. Generally, the 'I' of the Personality is active in comparison with the real '1', in the sense that it follows the latter's advice only when it thinks fit and except in very rare cases it fails to heed warnings. Of course, here we are not referring to the Just. But this does not mean that the 'I' of the Person- ality is not conscious of the imperatives and indications of the real 'I). He certainly is aware of them, at least in all instances when the man is placed before an important alternative and must choose. If at that moment the 'I' of the Personality is not exposed to strong outward or inward influences: fascinating views and calculations for the intellectual centre; likes or dislikes for the emotional centre, and if, at least momentarily, it is not under the sway of the desires of the 'I' of the body, it can hear and take into consideration the messages of the real 'I'. The latter are adapted to the unfinished Personality's capabilities in perception and to its level of comprehension as, for example, in the case of the Decalogue. But generally these conditions are not realized, and then man takes no notice ofthe warnings of the real 'I'. Yet, the 'I' of the Personality knows perfectly well that the messages it receives from the real 'I' are correct and clear. So much is this so that in ignoring them the 'I' of the Personality suffers the bitter after-taste of the false moves it has ta- ken. This is why acts that are prompted by hypocrisy, cowardice, perfidy, jealousy, vengeance and other expressions of human baseness, not to mention lies, never pass without leaving a certain bitterness at the bottom of one's heart. The bestial joy of acquiring domination by violence or crime, even one that goes undiscovered and unpunished, will never com- pensate for the affliction of remorse that follows. The result is that in spite of its apparently domineering attitude towards the real 'I), the 'I' of the Personality is drawn to it. The situation is even more complicated by the fact that the impressions left by these conflicts of intention3 are obliterated from the individual's memory only with great dificulty, if ever. With time and with the accumulation of decisions taken arbitrarily by the 'I' of the Personality without caring in the least about the inmost heart,4 these conflicts increase in strength and in proportion. But then, the human Personality is also too often drawn towards the other side, towards the 'I' of the body. If the real 'I' reveals no trace of doubt, in the majority of cases nor are any to be found in the 'I' of the body. This is why, when the latter raises its voice, its imperatives are almost always categorical. It is in this way that the Personality or, in other words, the exterior man who is identified with it, is pulled in opposite directions by imperatives proceeding from the soulS - from the real '1'-and by others proceeding from the flesh ... from the 'I' of the body. If, for better or for worse, the Personality manages to ignore the im- peratives of the real 'I), its evasive tactics and suppleness are only rarely successful when it is opposed by the imperatives of the 'I' ofthe body. This struggle between the Personality, which is composite and is therefore weak, and the 'I' of the body, which takes clear decisions, generally results in a defeat for the Personality, preceded by manoeuvres, cheating, and by lies to itself and to others. In the majority of cases, when the Personality succumbs to the 'I' of the body, the latter is acting under the direct or indirect influence of sexual energy. Then the Voice of the real 'I), the supreme Judge, will speak to the man from the depths of his heart, and its verdict is always firm and just. 3.

'Arne' often translated 'Immortal Soul'."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"But although his Personality is unfinished, contrary to certain modern theories, the exterior man is responsible for his acts. This fact is confirmed by all Religions. R omantic literature in all its variations is based on the diagram repro- duced above (fig. 26), which faithfully reflects the realities of the life of the psyche of the exterior man. This represents the interdependence of man's three I's, from which arise the continual inner dissensions that take place in the consciousness of the 'I' of the Personality whenever it comes out of its mental somnolence. This happens as the effect of conflicts of intention provoked by shocks, whether they come from without or from within. St Paul describes this very real situation with singular force when he says: for that which I do I allow not; for what I would, that do I not, but what I hate, that do I.~ This is also the theme of the free romance, as already defined, which is the characteristic of the moral relationship between man and woman during the Cycle of the Son. This romance is based on reciprocal free choice in love, duly crowned by marriage, and built around the principle of monogamy. Of course, this is not an ideal formula since in practice it is nearly always a failure; it is an intermediate solution between the patriarchalpolygamy of the Cycle of the Father and the infallible unique romance of the Cycle of the Hob Spirit, which is based on the reciprocal recognition and union of polar beings. We repeat that the three 1's represented in this diagram form the basis of every romance experienced by exterior man, especially in the more dra- matic forms. But the free romance holds an almost irresistible attraction for these men, because its romantic side is reinforced by the sexual influ- ence. For the representations that lovers make to one another are coloured by Illusion, begin their action under the sexual influence, and never cor- respond with reality. But even if they are objectively false, these sublime representations can provoke ideal visions in the lovers simply through the inflow of fine energies; energies that come in the first place from the Hydrogen SI-12. Once the marriage is consummated, these visions prc- gressively come up against implacable reality; disillusion and dissatisfac- tion result and generally lead one or both of the ex-lovers into the arms of a 'prince charming' or a 'wonder woman'. On the whole, this is the plan of the free romance experienced by exterior people, whether this romance is lived or written, read, or seen in a film. 6. Romans vii: 15. From the King James Version. 224 Circumstances such as place and time, as well as the direct and indirect additions, only serve to pad it out. In practice, this is an unresolvable situation -except for the union of polar beings, of course. But the latter, which is the only real union, seems an unrealizable dream to the exterior man. So he becomes resigned to his lot, saying that if marriage is an imperfect formula, every other solution is equally doomed. Turning away from the higher plane, he descends to the lower plane to discover adultery. W here the partners are of a romantic nature, their reciprocal repre- sentations and the visions which can flow from them, although illusory in nature, reflect the image for each of them of his or her real love or ideal polar type. This is why the engagement period sometimes gives two people who are betrothed the delusion that their love is the true and unique Iwe, and this illusion gives birth to a temporary inflow of refined energies. The free romance is platonic at first, but a struggle takes place afterwards which nearly always ends with the victory of the body. This is the end of the first act. Then another struggle begins against circumstances which are often unfavourable; but properly speaking, this is no longer a question of romance. The main characteristic of the free romance as revealed during the Cycle of the Son is that, although it begins with a knot and follows this with intrigue, this romance as sd remains unfinished, as with the fig tree in the Gospel which brought forth only leaves.' Here we must avoid confusion: marriage as we know it - that of exterior men who are imperfect by definition - is hardly the fruit of love. It is, on the contrary, its ending. It really has no organic link with what could be real love. Only true Love can bring forth fruit But first we must attain it.8 T he position of the Personality may be compared to that of a weak man flanked on either side by strong men in different situations: though the real 'I' is invincible, it is also, one might say, ignored. The 'I' of the body varies in its desires, but it is in direct and permanent contact with the Personality which lives in the body, it depends on it, and it manifests 7. Ref. Matthew xxi: 19. 8. Ref. I Corinthians xiv: 1"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"through it. One may therefore say that the Personality does not el much autonomy in relation to it. The situation changes entirely when the magnetic centre opens the 'fi door' of the Personality to the real 'I', after it takes over the direction oi LLIC lower centres once it has assured their co-ordinated working. This is when the complete and perfect fusion takes place in which the 'I' of the Person- ality identifies itself with the real 'I'. This is the second Birth, that of Individualit_y. After this, the 'I' of the body can no longer offer any resis- tance to, nor can ever impose its will on, the 'I' of the Individuality. This is a state of ecstasy, which the Individuality can in principle enter at will, it can even suspend the normal functioning of the five senses, as we have been shown by the martyrs supported with joy by the saints.' The following figure shows the new relationship between the three I's after the second Birth: \"oy 'I' of the body Personality Real T (The arrows indicate the direction in which the Iud&idruJi@ exercises its authority in everyday life.) The body is glorified and sublimated by this second Birth. With the completion of his Personality, man becomes perfect although still belong- ing to the same fundamental type: 1,2 or 3. In this new condition, thefilters function perfectly, only letting pure elements pass into each of the three scales of nutrition. For the man who has crossed the second Threshold, the above diagram should be presented differently in order to better correspond to the rea- lity; it is no longer the real 'I' who lives within the Personality and the latter in the body, as in the externalman, but instead it is the real 'I' which envelops 9. Ecstasy has several degrees, of which the lowest can be attained without any spiritual culture. This is what those who search for the mystical 'initiation' we have called mysticalphenomenalirm, try to attain. The Orthodox Tradition is resolutely against it. In the Orient for thousands of years, certain people have used narcotics to try and reach this phenomenalistic plane. After the XIXth century, this method penetrated into the Occident. It is superfluous to state that these experiments lead to the degeneration of the individual and prevent his esoteric evolution. the Personality and gives birth to the Individgalig which, in its turn, includes the body. The two diagrams that follow, figs. 28 and 29, reflect man's condition before and after his second Birth. BEFORE AFTER BODY IEiT!

We added that the knowledge and savoir-faire that this Knowledge - Gnosis-enables one to acquire, represent thephilosopher'sstone of medieval mysticism, and that they can cause the desired transmutation in the dis- ciple.'' This transmutation chiefly consists of a change in the direction of the authority that acts between these different I's. 10. Vol 1. fig. 14. 11.

If we apply this to the present case, this means that as gnosis, conquered by conscious efforts, establishes a link between the Personality and the real 'I' of the disciple, a comparable link is automatically and effortlessly estab- lished between the Personality and the body. Our schema then takes the following aspect: Body Soul = Personality SOUL = Spirit 'I' of the body 'I' of the Personality Real 'I' FIG. 32 As long as the Personality lives immersed in the 'A' influences to which it is attached by the interests of its ordinary life,'* it is generally passive in its relationship to the body which, for it, constitutes the supreme value, and it remains ignorant of the 'By influences. In this extreme example the Per- sonality falls, more willingly than not, under the authority of the 'I' of the body, which in turn is dominated by sex in its direct and indirect mani- festations. The feeble human heart too often approves of this state of things. We may recall Jesus' words: tvhereyour treasure is, there willyour heart be also.I3 H ere it is necessary to give a few more particulars. We are told in the catechism that the exterior man, man as we know him, is in a corrupt state as a result of the Fall. Now, it is not the whole man that fell, but the I Personality which, tempted by the relative autonomy of the lower intel- lectual centre, turned away from the Tree of Life, It was dazzled by the 1 fruits of the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil; the faculty of being able to gauge its own situation, the faculty of calculating and comparing, by the attributes of the 'I' of the Personality, and by the 'clear consciousness' of wakefulness. Unlimited horizons then opened up before this 'I', horizons which are in fact inaccessible since they ceaselessly flee before the explora- tions of the human spirit, but their pursuit has continued from those days right up to our own time. I The frz/its ofthe Tree ofthe knowledge of Good and Evil are relative. In time, man understood this. But by the time he was able to grasp the truth he had already forgotten everything permanent, unalterable and, therefore, real. I And in the magnificent race of Progress-progress only in means of doing 12. Lit. 'vital interests'. 13. Matthew vi: 21."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"things - he forgot himself. For him, the Tree of Life became a legend. Having forgotten the real 'I), the Personality was progressively deified as the supreme value in an observable, knowable, sensory world where man knows full well that all is relative. This situation persists today and is even getting worse. The 'conquest of Space', which is the latest watchword of intellectual progress, does not change the human condition. All that remains of what existed before the fall has been handed down to us thanks to Seth-Eve's son-who was mysteriously conceived and who is the father of the esoteric Tradition. But only a thin thread14 of this Tradition has been preserved in Eastern Orthodoxy and elsewhere. The fall of the Personality did not entail the fall of the real 'I), nor of the 'I' of the body. The former seems obvious, but the latter seems more difficult to understand. The surprising thing is that the body dies. But the body became mortal precisely because of the corruption of the Per- sonality: the motor centre, which is the physiological motor of the body, suffers the same fate as the Personality, as it is part of it, and as a result is closely linked to it. Thus, contrary to general belief, the body does not die because of its own deficiency, but because of that of the Personality. When the latter is no longer in this situation the body is governed by the sexual centre which, like the higher emotional and intellectual centres, is immortal. In man, this is the monad which expresses the Absolute 111, just as the higher emotional Centre expresses the Absolute I1 and the higher intellectual Centre the Absolute I. By looking at things from this angle we can better understand the indication given us in the Book of Genesis, which says that man was made into a living soul.15 Commenting on this text, St Paul said: there is a natural body and there is a Jpiritual body. And so it is written, thefirst man Adam was made a living soul, IG Now, the corrupted man, especially the cultured man 1,2, or 3, thinks that he has come into the world not to live, but to die. We have seen that with complete regeneration, man obtains 'IJ, Consciousness and will1' in absolute form. To be more precise: the organ of the real 'I' in man is the higher emotional Centre; the organ of Consciousness is the higher intellectual Centre; the organ of Will is the sexual Centre. It seems clear now that, in spite of its deficiency, its illnesses and even its death, the 'I' of the body, governed by the sexual Centre, is infinitely 14. Fr. 'minrcfi/ie're'. 15. Genesis ii: 7. 16. I Corinthians xv: 44-45 17. Vol. I, pp. 82-82. stronger than the human Personality as it functions in the exterior man, in whom it takes the form of 'shifting sands'. W e spoke earlier about thefirst link that should be established between the Personality and the real 'I'. This is a relationship established between them through the disciple's conscious efforts during his initiation into esoteric Knowledge, and it is neither sketchy nor nebulous. Just like positive science, thisgnosisis systematic; and it is just like other knowledge because of the systematic structure of the Cosmos, whether it is taken as a whole or in its smallest details. The relationship between the human Personality and man's real 'I' which forms the object of esoteric science and is comprehended in certain dif- ferent kinds of discipline which form a complete cycle. This cycle comprises eight disciplines in all, each of which leads to a clearly defined result. The first should be learned and assimilated before the second Threshold, while climbing the Staircase. If correctly taught, studied and digested in theory and in practice, it enables the student to mount the fourth step of the Staircase and appear before the second Threshold with a good chance of crossing it. It is useless and even dangerous to appear before this Threshold before acquiring this Knowledge. Gnosis, when it is studied and practised like this, leads to court& Love, which rules the fourth step. Court4 Love is in fact the love that Jesus preached in the New Testament. It forms a higher revelation relative to the carnal Love which is animal in nature and which one finds in the Old Testament. It is the Key to the Kingdom of God, that Paradise lost. n practice, from the viewpoint of man's interest in life,'' this Paradise 1 appears in the form of an indivisible and indissoluble union of polar beings.

We will continue the theme of this chapter by taking one more towards the reality of what is taught by the Tradition in the for^,. gnosis or higher Knowledge, which is the first discipline of absol Knowledge.

John i: 13. 23. Cf. I Corinthians ii: 14. 24. I Corinthians iii: 19. 25. Vol. I, p. 247, fig. 61. H owever, it is difficult to conceive - this concept being too far from our usual representations - that anybody's real 'I', as a monad of the manifestedAbsolute, must be and is in fact androgynous in essence, in other words, that it is polarized or bi-polar. At first, this idea seems so unbelievable that one has to get used to it. Yet, is not our Personality also bi-polar in a certain measure? Of course. Through introspection, every man can find certain feminine traits in himself, just as every woman can find some masculine traits in herself. In certain extreme cases, this polarization produces the abnormal but well- known phenomenon of effeminate men and masculine women. In the unfinished Personality of the exterior man, which is shifting sand, this polarity is not yet, and cannot yet be either clearly defined or properly formed. These are qualities only of the fully developed and born Person- ality. However, we can glimpse this polarization as it appears in us. This may be obtained without any difficulty through a succession of introspec- tive efforts which will pass almost the whole of our inner content in review. In fact, this polarization of the elements of our Personality is nothing but the faithful reflection of the world. This explains why the Orthodox Tradition applies the term 'world' to the whole life of the content of man's psyche. Without this polarity, any understanding between persons of the oppo- site sex would be absolutely impossible. It is generally difficult anyway, because of our unfinished nature and because we have individual defor- mations. It is the presence of common elements in the two sexes that bridges between their Personalities and, to the measure of their evolu- tion, renders mutual comprehension possible. Now, if we pass from the Personality to the body, we will observe without any difficulty that our bodies are also polarized. Embryology and anatomy show us that all the organs that are characteristic of the - man are found in rudimentary form in the woman, and vice versa. In the working of the human organism, and especially in that of sexual life, the hormones play a role of polarization which reminds one of the analogous phenomenon encountered in the life of the psyche. Indeed, we know that a certain percentage of feminine hormones is to be found in man and that the woman's organism secretes a certain proportion of masculine hormones. And just as the polarization of the psyche allows mutual com- prehension between people of the opposite sex, so polarization of the hormones ensures sexual attraction. This phenomenon is complex, and the present level of our knowledge does not throw any light on it. But from whar has already been said we can"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"state that a decline or complete lack of the hormones proper to the opposite sex leads to a decline of sexual attraction due to the lack of this 'bridge'. From whichever point of view one considers the problem one comes to the conclusion that, man or woman, the whole human being ispolarixed within. I t is only when this observation has become evident to us that we can make the assertion that every human being carries the image of his polar being in the depths of his heart, and that we can feelit. In certain conditions it is even possible to objectify it. However, this is not the case for the great majority of human beings. Firstly, the idea of a polar being is unknown to us. Secondly, when we are told about this it generally leaves us indifferent, as we prefer the system of free romance. Only an infinitely small minority of human beings feel the anguish caused by their inward isolation and ardently aspire to find the La4 of their dreams. Before one can aspire (to something) one must at least think (about it). This thought must literally devour the Knight's heart, forcing him to accomplish the most perilous feats with the aim of finding the object of his aspirations. Those who live anchored to their unfinished Personalities, dominated at all times by their bodily desires, and who participate enthusiastically in a life ruled by 'A' influences, are satisfied with their lot and feel neither the need for nor any interest in such a search. The 'free romance' suits and satisfies them, and they find the idea of the singular romance chimerical. Naturally, this does not change anything in the objective state of things. A lthough its significance was forgotten, a very ancient symbol of the real '1', the divine monad of the manifested Absolute, has been pre- served by the Tradition in the Orient. It has now re-appeared in the West, and is now utilized by certain authors, who have written various commen- taries on it. This is it: colour GOLD M 0 colour SILVER W When applied to the relationship between the 1's which we studied earlier, it gives the following figure: The great mystery lies in the fact that the real 'I' ofpolar beings is one and indivisible. One for the two of them. Not only this, and here again it seems mad in the eyes of men, but it lives simultaneously in the two Personalities and, naturally, in the two separate but polarized bodies. By changing the direction of the preceding diagram for sheer conve- nience, we can represent this situation in the following manner:"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"REAL BI-POLAR 'I' This is the diagram of two polar beings before they are united or before each one enters a separate marriage. The union of two polar beings who as yet do not realize their polarity may be represented as follows: REAL BI-POLAR 'I' In this case, in spite of inward and sexual concordance, their respective Personalities play the role of apples of discord. Notwithstanding the perfect polarity of their bodies - which is an absol~te fact in polar beings -a rupture is probable due to the karmic deformation and 'free movements' of their Personalities. W hether it happens only once or repeatedly, the case of adultery is represented in the following schema. Like polygamy or polyandry, adultery produces a union only on the physical level.

In the latter case, one must note that in olden days, when the Wheel of Destiny turned slowly, this reincarnation could sometimes take place only after centuries of waiting. Now, on the eve of the Era of the Holy Spirit, everything on this plane takes place at the rhythm of contemporary life on the earth. UNION REALIZED by polar Personalities by the effect of courtly Love Polar bodies still separated The perfect and therefore complete union of polar beings brings to birth the Individuality, the New Microcostnos that is the realization of the Androgyne. Taken to the limit of its development, this Individuality is re- presented symbolically in fig. 40. This is Paradise, rediscovered by the Grace of God through Love attained by conscious efforts, and through the courage the polar beings have man- ifested in the course of their uninterrupted invisible Combat. This union is Sacred. On reaching this point and looking back on the road they have covered, the polar beings will understand the meaning of the words that Jesus addressed to his Disciples a few moments after his arrest: '.. . Andye now therefore have sorrow; but I will seeyou again, andyour heart shall rejoice; andyour jy no man taketh from you.'26 United polar personalities UNITED POLAR BODIES 26.

The number is sixteen, eight in each direction. Thus, by following a normal esoteric evolution, the bi-polar Personality becomes a Individualig and obtains absolute mastery over the body. Once the eigl links with the body are firmly established, the Individualig can exercise th mastery in the form of eightpavers which have been considered marvel101 by human beings from time immemorial.

Be ofgood cheer, I have overcome the Now that we are reaching the end ofthe mesoteric cycle of Gnosis, it is time to raise the question of the AIM of our life. We have viewed this problem many times from different aspects: cosmic, planetary, social, etc. But now we will try to study it more closely and, if possible, to find a solution on the individual or egocentric scale while keeping it within the framework of the complete Doctrine as this is now known to the reader. This problem has been studied from the earliest times by the most talented of men. Philosophy, ancient and modern, religious and secu- lar, offers a number of solutions, but these solutions cannot generally be taken into consideration by science since they define the unknown through intermediate steps involving one or many other unknown fac- tors. This is why, in the absence of objective elements which constitute the usual premises of a problem, we resort to factors deriving from beliefs, traditions, etc. From whatever angle one looks at it, this method will not stand up to scientific examination nor to critical analysis. What is more, whenever this problem is posed, each philosopher or poet marks it with his personal touch, which, in most cases, is pessimistic. Pushkin, who was passionately in love with life, had a very keen sense of truth and was incapable of lying to himself. Yet he was content to ask himself the question without trying to find a solution to it: Marvellous gift, useless gift, Life, to what end were you given to us? This great poet, whose lyricism was dedicated to beauty and truth, did not develop his contradictory observation of the uselessness of a marvel- lous but factitious existence. When he was thirty-seven years old he was killed in a duel because of a woman - his wife. Though younger than he, Pushkin's contemporary, Lermontov, was a poet of the same stature, and at the age of twenty-eight he was also killed in a duel. He wrote in the same pessimistic vein: Life without love is the tomb. Love eternally? - Impossible! Here are two constatations, two visions of things that the prophetic spirit of these two great poets grasped and poured out in their moments of inspiration when they were under the dominion of Mqa, the Great 27. John xvi: 33. 240"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Illusion, the sovereign power of the General Law that is enforced by me Absolute 111. These are constatations regarding the state of things existing in our Mixtus Orbis, in a worldly life predominantly influenced by the !A' fac- tors. Even though both of them were bound, nay anchored, to this 'life' by all the force of their ardent temperaments, they were nevertheless capable of contemplating it from the elevated point of view of the 'By influences; perhaps even 'C' if not 'D' influences. This dialectical position created an inward anguish in them both: they lived in a world that was submerged in lies when they themselves were incapable of lying. It was a situation without any solution on our plane. And the General Law wiped thej off the face of the earth, letting their tumultuous souls enter into tl Peace of the Lord, their celestial Home. However, in spite of his pessimism, Lermontov went even further than Pushkin, and announced the great truth about which everybody was generally silent. For, though the poets versified it in different ways, they alluded to it only in symbolic form. He proclaimed it aloud, which was positive. Let us now study this problem from the point of view of the Tradition. The reply to this great question is to be found in certain esoteric monuments. In the Orthodox Tradition, one is taught that a book exists which is The Golden Book. The maxims and texts which figure in it are revealed to disciples gradually, as they progress on the Way. These fragments are read to them only once, but the disciple must remember them word for word and learn them by heart. - This is not a Book of the Dead, but a Book of the Living. And this is what is inscribed in-the book regarding the question we have just raised: To live means to love; He who loves not, hard& lives. He leads a mournful existence Whose on4 meaning lies in the hope of loving. The remainder of this text is aimed at polar beings. We have already commented on it without having divulged it, and we will return to this subject later. This principle which is so strongly stated in Lermontov's couplet had already been pronounced by St Paul nearly two thousand years ago. He said: the aim of life is to attain Love.' To attain Luve is indeed to attain Light, to attain the Spirit, to finally attain God. For: God is Love2 God is Light: God is ~pirit.~ And St John adds: For Love is of God . . . and He that does not love has not known ~od.~ 0 ur ideas of the temporal and the spirit& are generally opposed. This opposition is expressed as an alternative, a dualistic formula which, as such, remains incomplete because it is faulty in its reasoning and con- sequently leans towards the two extremes. Nevertheless it seems convin- cing to our intellect, since this is also of a binary nature. But although it is admitted by the mind, it does not explain or resolve anything. On the contrary we find it as the basis of innumerable divisions, conflicts, anath- emas and wars. In order to make this formula applicable in practice it is necessary to harmonize it with the objectively real state of things as it was revealed in the second part ofthis volume: with the system of the three cosmic octaves. Then we can easily understand that the complete formula is of a threefold nature. Balanced and harmonious, it covers the whole scale of man's possible evolution, as well as that of human society - without disconti- nuity. And whereas the dualistic formula spiritual-temporalengenders only doubt, divisions, and death, the threefold formula, which is complete and vivifying, leads from death to life. Inserting eternity as an intermediate term between these two extremes represented by the terms spiritualand temporal, the formula then appears in complete form as: Spiritunl- Eternal- Temporal It is easy to understand that each of these terms represents the attributes of the Absolute I, the Absolute 11, or the Absolute 111, respectively. 1.

I John iv: 7."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"On the plane of human love, the real antinomy, which is the object of esoteric work and studies, arises from the opposition of the temporalto the eternaland not of the temporal to the spiritual which, for the exterior man, is confined to the domain of pure theory. The key to the question of polar beings is to be found here. It is a crucia one for those who aspire to follow the fifth Way, which is that of th Knight and of the Lady of his Dreams. For the real 'I), which is ONE for polar beings but lives in two Person- alities in two different bodies, belongs to the Eternal and thus belongs indirectly to the Spiritual. While the 'I' of the body belongs to the Temporal. I n a manner of speaking the 'I' of the Personality, which is situated between the two other I's, is the great question-mark of our lives. The Personality can perish if it identifies itself with the 'I' of the body, or it can gain eternal life by identifying with the real '1'. So everything depends on the attitude that a man adopts towards himself and his life: on whether he builds directly on the sand or digs first until he reaches the rock.' In fact, the human Personality is a talent, a marvellous Divine loan given to man so that he can make it germinate through Work; it is not given to him so that he can bury it. If he does so, he is only establishing himself in the Temporalillusion which he obstinately takes for the real in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, evidence that is confirmed by death. This idea, or rather this fact of an existence loaned to us with the oppor- tunity to make it permanent through Work, should be ever-present in the seeker's mind if he aspires to the Way, the Truth and the ~ife.~ And he should not forget for one instant the maxim which is inscribed in the Golden Book, that anyone who does not develop his talent loses it. W e have said that Love, like the personality, is also a Divine talent which is loaned to man, and we will repeat this more than once. Everybody shouts: I love, you love, he loves, etc. But first of all we need to be aware of just what can be objectively true in this assertion. This is the problem. The nature of Love cannot be defined precisely in scientific language. We can only judge from its known manifestations. 6. Matthew vii: 24-26. 7. John xiv: 6. St Paul gives us an objective and complete description of it in the following lines: Love ispatient and fullof kindness; live envieth not; live vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up with pride; does nothing dishonest; seeketh not her own, is not easib provoked, thinketh not evil, rejoiceth not in iniquib but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.' These are the manifestations of Love, that is, of true, objective Love. By reversing the terms of St Paul's formula one may recognize without any difficulty the manifestations of negative emotions like jealousy, that senti- ment of ownership that is stretched to include the one whom one qualifies as the 'beloved'. Thus when one says: 'I love you and, since I love you, you should dowhatever I please', it is obvious that there is no question of Love here, but of something totally different. However, to know Love in itself one must feel it-must live it. And one cannot feel it except in confuence with it. We must never lose sight of this reality: Love, being of the Divine essence, reveals an absolute power in its manifestations. The result is that one cannot command love any more than one can forbid love. We know this in our heart of hearts, whatever we may say and however we may plead for ourselves or moralize for others. II (1) We have just said that the Aim oflye is to attain Lone. This principle calls for commentary. After having said: Seek for the attainment of~ove,~ St Paul continues: And also aspire to spiritzlalgifts.10 Then he goes on to classify them. After due reflection it is easy to deduce that the public to whom the Apostle addressed his Epistle was prepared to receive his word. It becomes even more evident on rereading the end of the passage, where St Paul makes the following remark: If any man think hirnself to be a prophet, or spiritual1' let him acknowledge that the things that I write ~ntojou are the Corn- mandrnents of the ~ord. l2 By this, we are given to understand that there were certain esoterically developed people among the Corinthians who received this Epistle: some men4, ready to cross the second Threshold, and some men-5, or 'Prophets', in 8. I Corinthians xiii: 47, Literally translated from the Slavonic text. 9. I Corinthians xiv: 1. 10. I Corinthians xiv: 2. 11. Inspired, 'pneunratikor'. 12. I Corinthians xiv: 37."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"the words of St Paul, who were capable of understanding itsi3 Referring the others, he adds: But fay man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.14 The degree of Love that enables the acquisition of spiritualgifts- w: we have called the acquisition of new faculties-is an attribute of the man 2 who has passed through the second Birth. In other words, it belongs to the newborn Individgality which has acquired the consciousness of the real 'I' in its sublime androgynous manifestations. It is the fruit of Love, of the Divine Grace which is accorded to one who worh in the Lord's field, that is, who works esoterically. However, Love always remains the Aim of lqe, even for someone who is ignorant, according to the Apostle's expression, one who does not parti- cipate in this Work. Better still, Love is the Aim of lqe on the whole cosmic scale, right down to the most primitive organisms. As far as human beings are concerned, three characteristic levels appear. hat - W hen we speak about human beings here, we envisage different cases, but always of normal people moving amongst equally normal fel- low-beings and in the normal circumstances oflife in our Mixtus Orbis. But present day life, with the enormous gap between the technical progress which is its essential characteristic, and moral progress which marks time, leads to abnormal conditions on all planes in the domain of 'A' influences, and in all the layers of society. These conditions tend to provoke patho- logical deformations in human beings. This delay in our evolution pro- vokes a moral sclerosis, so that in the second half of the XXth century, at the very door of the Cycle of the HoEy Spirit, contemporary man lives without yet having fully emerged from the domain of the Old Testament. These absurd circumstances, coming from the difference in levels men- tioned above, may be an advantage to the man who is strong and wide awake: they provide a resistance. This obstacle offers an excellent point of application for his strength and, through it, even a possibility of rapidly acquiring the Victory that he desires. As for the weakling, he yields and gets lost in the crowd who follow the broad way leading to destruction.15 Our epoch offers us the spectacle of a massive application of the law pointed out in the Gospel, according to which whosoever hath, to him shall be given, but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.16 13. Ibid. 14. Ibid., 38. After the Slavonic text. 15. Matthew vii: 13. 16. Matthew xiii: 12. This human weakness is expressed in a characteristic manner by the attitude of men and women towards Love. 'Avant-garde' philosophy reduces the problem of Love to monstrous formulz which are oversimplified in the extreme, but which pass as 'rea- lism'. The following is a good example of this: - Love? It is simply the contact of two epidermi! One must admit that this is the bottom of the ladder, even lower than that of animals, for whom the 'contact of the epidermis' is enriched by the instinct of preservation of the species and often even by true love on the level at which it arises.I7 One cannot try to justify Love's profanation by slogans such as 'after all, it has always been like this.' The hold of the Absolute I11 is certainly great and is generally decisive. But can one liken this more or less skilful 'contact' to cases like that of Menelaus, King of Sparta? Menelaus ac- quitted himself notably and was known for his heroic deeds in war; he took on the traitor Paris in single combat and caused him to flee. After the fall of Troy, like a good Spartan, he rushed to the palace, sword in hand, to punish his unfaithful wife, Helen, the cause of ten years of war, Yet, when he entered her chamber and saw the profile of her beautiful breast he forgot everything, threw away his sword, and took Helen in his arms! If Menelaus' defeat in surrendering to the current of love from the Absolute 111 was able to arouse the mockery of Euripides (Andromeda, 629), the triumph of the 'contact of two epidermi' can only give rise to pity. So let us put aside ancient Fables and modern cynicism to examine again the typical basic stereotypes of Love. H ere, we will reintroduce the old terminology which defines the three great categories into which the whole of humanity is divided: bylic, pgchic and pnetttnatic. By bylic, we mean the man who lives below the first Threshold, bypgchic we indicate psychological man, one who has crossed the first Threshold, and who has started on the Staircase leading to the second Threshold; by $nettmatic, we refer to one who, having crossed the second Threshold and reached his second Birth, is making progress towards the third Threshold. As we have seen, everything that lives, lives by Love, and aspires to Love. And by changing its appearance, Love manifests itself as a whole scale of values. It is, however, important to understand that this whole scale of values corresponds to several different levels of Consciousness. And in the case of Love as in that of Consciousness, the acquisition of the 17. Cf. 'L'Amour et la Pensic chcx Les bztes et the? lcrgenr'-Serge Voronoff. Paris, Fasqualle, 1936."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"higher level does not automatically exclude or annihilate the lower le ' that has been transcended, but transforms it. One often speaks of the sublimation of sex which follows the passagc higher levels of Consciousness. In fact, this sublimation takes place cvl,- tinuously on the whole Great Ladder of the evolution of living beings. For mankind it involves three steps which correspond to the three categories, already described, into which humanity is sub-divided. The blic man is satisfied with life below the first Threshold, whether he is a 'success' or not, whether he is rich or poor, happy or unhappy. As a result his aspirations and his desires, like his loves, are also kept below the first Threshold. Thepneumatic man, that is, one who has crossed the second Threshold and has been born again, aspires to attain and cross the third Threshold, which will open up the Way leading to the ~leroma,*~ the ineffable Love in the bosom of the Absolute. Thepgchic (psychological) man also aspires to this state; but before it becomes possible for him to work effectively in this sense, he must be regenerated and come to the second Birth. In the first volume of our work, we studied the elements of the Wa_y in detail and pointed out that access to what is properly called the Wq demands assiduous work which may be divided into four stages. This forms a Staircase of four 'steps' of which the last is Love-the level that the man of the psyche must attain to appear before the second Threshold and to cross it. We indicated the traditional virtues which correspond to these four stages: Faith - Hope -Knowledge (Gnosis) and, lastly Lme. The execution of this successive programme of work depends on the continuity of the faithfgl's efforts. The latter are often super-human, and must be made in the framework of one of the four Way, which must correspond to the neophyte's type of psyche. In this second volume we have also seriously studied thefifth Way, which offers the possibility of rapidly attaining and triumphantly crossing the second Threshold. This way is only possible to two polar beings in a united and conscious effort. This is the way of the Knight and the Lady of his Dreams. In the previous chapters we studied different examples of evolution and of the checks that occur on its way. We will now try to delve deeper into the question and see in practical terms how the question of polar beings arises in life. We will study the possibilities and the obstacles of the fifth way- for it is important to know this -and finally examine the fate that is reserved for polar beings after their meeting here below in the Mixtus Orbis in which we live. 18. Greek word meaning 'fullness'. (Ed.) et us re-examine the general diagram of the Wq as it appears in the first volume of our work, reproduced here as Fig. 42. We are now going to add to the interpretation already given. The essential thing is to understand that someone who climbs the Staircase by following one of the four ways faces a twofold task: the acquisition of Gnosis in order to attain Love and, at the same time, the liquidation of the karmic burden accumulated in the previous and current films. This work must be accomplished with all the Faith and Hope one can muster if one wishes to reach a result during the course of this life or during the film or films to come. The task is great and always difficult, but the risk is relatively small as the demands are less than those made on the fifth way. The reason for this is that the latter is much more rapid than the fourth way, just as the fourth way is more rapid than the other three. The rapidity of the fifth way is the logical consequence of the fact that one covers it, so to speak, in the opposite direction. In following the first four ways the mutual recognition between polar beings only happens after the ~ second Threshold, but in the case of the fifth way it takes place intuitiveb i before the second Threshold and even before the first for one partner, or sometimes for both."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"This may be explained by the fact that the karmic burden never appears as an amorphous whole, but as the result of a certain number of positive and negative components, each on an appropriate plane, which when they are taken together form what is called the individual's Karma. As we have just said, polar beings may recognize each other even be$ the first Threshold since, seen from the angle of their profound attit towards Love, their karmic burden may be of no account or insignificanr. In other words, they live with a deep aspiration towards true Love v themselves, whether or not this is recognized and formulated. The not be capable of lying to themselves in this domain. This inward attitude immediately places the polar beings on the fo~ step of the Staircase, but they are then forced to quickly liquidate t karmic burden on the other planes of human consciousness. This bur may be light, medium or heavy, but it is different in each of the polar bej who form a couple. The mutual recognition ofpolar beings before the second or even be] the first Threshold presupposes that they have already acquired the mml- mum Faith and Hope that is demanded of them. Thus, already having Faith and Hope in large measure, and since they are on the step of Love, they only have to cultivate these in order to acquire Gnosis, and then liquidate the remainder of their Karma to give them access to the second Threshold. The method that applies to them is a little special. Their case is an exception to the normal. In the picturesque language of the Tradition we say that the method consists in empping the bags of Karma by repelling it with Gnosis. This is the imperative rule given to them. The reader who is committed to follow the fifth way must remember this maxim and meditate on its profound significance. But this undertaking is not easy. Efforts and superefforts are both ne- cessary if it is to be completed quickly enough, as it is not possible to remain indefinitely on the fourth step. As we have already indicated, the steps of the Staircase are made in such a way that they bear the aspirant only for a certain time, after which they collapse.1g These are the data ofthe problem that faces two polar beings the day they meet, when, through an indescribable inward movement, they sponta- neously feel the objective and absolute feeling that together they form only one being. This sudden revelation of the androgynous consciousness is marvellous. It in no way resembles anything that the poor human intellect can imagine, nor anything that the motor centre can imitate, although the latter tries to create something similar by usurping an abundant quantity of energy SI- 12 from the sexual centre. The androgynous consciousness is established 19. Cf. Volume I, p. 218. Fore :ude - .. . - - - - - - . vithin y will lrth heir ,den lngs Fore . . following the inflow of the energy SOL-12 which spontaneously floods the human heart. This energy, which comes from the higher emotional centre, has an effect that is totally unknown to even the most refined human Personality, with its 987 little I's, as long as it is only moved by the three lower centres. In this ideal case they are trub betrothed. For them, the nuptial benedic- tion or marriage takes on the significance of a true sacrament-a in Orthodoxy- by which the twain shall be onef~esh,~' being already ONE in the consciousness of their real 'I'. Thus they cross the second Threshold and the second Birth, that of the Individualit_, becomes an accomplished fact. These cases are most uncommon. Yet, it is obligatory that polar beings meet, and sometimes they do recognize each other. Yet they generally do I I not realize the treasure that each represents for the other, nor the mar- I vellous vista which opens before them because of this encounter. ~ Even when it is unconscious, the mutual attraction of polar beings is strong because of their androgynous nature, and when they become con- I scious of it, it is enormous. Then, the General Law intervenes and imme- diately lays a trap for them. Wonderstruck by their Love, they insensibly let themselves get caught in this trap and always, oftheir own free will and with the blessings of the Absolute 111, they become lovers without caring too much about the consequences of their act. For those who are caught in this pitfall, the situation creates problems which, if not insoluble, are certainly difficult to resolve. We have said over and over again and will now repeat that polar beings are bound to meet at least once in their lives. But this encounter takes place in very different circumstances which are precisely determined by the nature and weight of their karmic load. This latter is an old burden with which they are born, which is applied to the present film, multiplied by that which the two partners have accumulated in their present life before their encounter. Also, from the time they meet, by falling into the trap that is laid for them by the General Law, the polar beings create a new common I karmic burden which is then added to the preceding ones. They act in this way instead of trying, through joint conscious efforts, to progressively liquidate the old burdens until they are free at last and able to unite forever in the conditions required for the union of polar beings. These conditions are rigorous and hard. For them, if they really are polar beings, this is the passage for them from the free rornance to their singular romance. 20. The Greek word is 'mystcrion'. (Ed.) 21. Matthew xix: 5."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The conditions vary according to cases. Generally, the desired result is attained only after a hard struggle, because of the accumulated weight of the triple karmic burden. n the domain of the free romance the partners think seriously ofnothing 1 apart from their desire to be united, and everything is subordinated to this imperative desire that is intensified by the will of the Absolute IF c- much is this so that when one or even both of them are already bc elsewhere at the time of their meeting, they overlook it. In order to their consciences in this classical situation, they find its justification in so-called 'great love.' Whether the formula is hmband-wife-lover or wife-hmband-mistres~, both at the same time, or still more complex cases, the result is always identical: with this 'great love' they either commit themselves to the path o, wholesale lie, or else, which is even worse - they shut themselves up cold cynicism. Or, lastly, they break the links which unite them with family, their partner and their children by imposing their will viole All these actions invariably lead to more or less rapid exhaustion o original force of their Love. Apart from lying to others, they then beg lie to themselves. Love is the Divine express& of the Truth; the introduction of the lie ruins the happiness of the lovers. Their Love gives them a certain amount of credit, but this credit is short-lived. A honeymoon lasts only a month! I. \"V ~und calm their f the B in a their ntly. f the in to F or polar beings, to fall into this trap is equivalent to a capitulation of consciousness; a shameful capitulation without any attempt to resist the General Law. Even if the couple is composed of truly polar beings, if the lovers dc adhere to the supreme conditions demanded by Love, once their crec exhausted, Love disappears. The sequel is well-known: one finds oneself left with the broken pic This is the destiny of the free romance, whether it is crowned by marr or not, and even, we repeat, in the case of polar beings, if the gravity ,, their situation escapes them. This is the experience that life offers us if we have the courage to see things as they are. Classic and modern literature provide us with proof of this. From the angle of the 'A' influences this situation is only too normal. Everything comes to an end, and one says to oneself: 'Polar beings? It is ) not lit is wonderful, of course, but only for day-dreamers!' And one buries oneself in the mire. Yet the Love of polar beings is the only reality in life. They can and should sacrifice everything to attain this union in the purity and dignity of the Androgynous state. But we must be careful: they should sacrifice everything which is theirs. For if, esoterically speaking, man has the right to make sacrifices, he has no right to accept them. An agreed sacrifice abolishes karma; a sacrifice that is accepted multiplies it. I n the great majority of cases the paths ofpolar beings cross without any sign of real recognition. It may be an affair that is a little more agreeable and more durable than others, or it may even be 'unforgettable', but that is all. This is because the conscious union of polar beings occurs only with those who have already reached a certain level of spiritual culture. For the common run of men, the question does not even arise. The rule of the free romance meets all their needs: intellectual, moral and sexual. By the way, the reader must note that we are not passing any judgment. For they also contribute their mite towards the common cause but in a different way, within the framework of the General Law. In this way they ensure the continuous functioning of the third cosmic octave and furnish the cadres which are necessary for the functioning of the second and, through it, of the First cosmic octave. They too will have their re- ward, but after aeons of pleasure, voluptuousness, and suffering ... The following does not apply to the jgst; but those polar beings who recognize each other are generally, at the moment of their encounter, tied hand and foot by old and new karma that is created before their meeting and, all too often, created after it as well. Theirs is a distressing situation. This is no longer a question of an affair, for the Kingdom of Heaven has drawn nigh to them. Then, through an instantaneous awakening of consciousness, all the threads of their millennia1 past which lives in them, after having pene- trated into the most minute cells of their skin, converge as in a focus, and from this focus are projected glittering rays of the cosmic future which is open to them, and which fades away into the shadowless light of the Pleroma (Fullness). From the very moment of their encounter the responsibility that still weighs on the two polar beings is that of the prodigal son who is still hesitating before deciding to give up his wanderings and return to his father's house.

Will I have the strength to conquer doubt and to believe in the perfect, ever- lasting happiness that all my lost illusions cannot dace? Here we return to the Golden Book and to the text that was previously quoted in part. This is what follows: Every man is born bearing within him the image of hispolar being.

The polarity of two human beings is strictly determined by that of their higher centres. In polar Individgalities the polarity of the higher emotional centre enta and determines that of their sexual centres. However, this process is n reversible. The polarity of the sexual centres in two human beings does ~UL determine that of their whole beings, and it is not necessarily an indication of their polarity. The sexual centre, which is an attribute of every living being, necessari& involves with it only the motor centre. Thus for the human Personality, just as for the animals, the polarity ofthe 'I' of the body is not exclusive and can be found again in a certain limited number of cases. This is found from the following formula, given that two beings of the opposite sex togei possess twelve sectors for their motor centres, and that we are natur speaking of combination in pairs: ils Ot ^* ther :ally The conclusion is that the exterior man, whose Personality is not com- pletely developed, may in principle have in his life sixty-six women of sexual polarity, of whom sixty-five would be his so-called 'legitimate' mistresses and only one would be his Wife, his polar Being, the Singular Lady of his Dreams. Sixty-five of these cases can give rise to free romances; only one amongst the sixty-six can be the object of the singular romance. For no singularpolari~ exists for the 'I' of the body nor, of course, for that of the under-developed Personality - it is only found in the Individuality. We must note that due to the instability of the underdeveloped Person- ality, the free romance generally begins at the call of the sexual centre. And because of this instability, once the honeymoon is over the free romance begins to decline. Of course, under the dominion of the Absolute 111, after the failure of the first romance, there still remain sixty-five other possibilities. To this one must add a few liaisons such as 'arranged' marriages in their countless variations, but they are no part ofthe free romance: they belong to the vast domain of prostitution. This is the fictitious sentimental framework in which the lives of exterior men unfurl and mark time. Since they do not feel the need for it, they cannot distinguish the 'sixty-sixth' possibility which could be their salvation.22 W e still have to consider the question of the criteria by which one can objective& recognize one's polar being or be convinced that someone who appears to be the one really is so. It will help us in our analysis to return to the diagram of the Way (page 249) once more in order to introduce certain additional ideas. This diagram includes four main stages separated by three Thresholds. Before the first, life comes under the dominion of the 'A' influences, but arrows from the domain of the 'By influences are projected into it; these calls are addressed to those few who are capable of intercepting them. Generally, a 'life' that is lived without a vivifying and permanent ,4im is subject to physical and moral exhaustion. In the metaphorical language 22. The French phrase used here, 'planthe de salut', combines ideas of a drowning man saved by catching hold of a plank with the Christian idea of salvation, a combination which cannot be so nicely achieved in English. (Ed.)"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"of the Tradition, it is a Valley ofjwers, but unhr eachjwer a serpent lies coiled. In less poetic terms, this 'life' is defined as Hell. It is possible to imagine that if Adam had not fallen, then, (instead of) the first and second Thresholds there would, in fact, only be one. In that case, the first Threshold would have filled the role now filled by the second, that of a door opening directly to Paradise, with view of the third Threshold, the door to the Plerorna. However, fallen humanity is now below the first Threshold. And after crossing this the seeker is still forced to climb the Staircase before reaching the second Threshold. We must remember that the work demanded can only be accomplished through the conscious efforts of the seeker, and that it must be carried out during his lfe on earth. This is Pzlrgatory. Thus, for fallen man to have access to Paradise it is absolutely compul- sory for him to pass through Purgatory, and to do so while it isda~) for the night cometh, when no man can work.23 T he great didactical principle of Savoir-Faire lies in the fact that some- one who wishes to learn must begin by acting as though he had already acquired the Knowledge. For example, one cannot learn drawing without starting to sketch, nor can one learn how to type without sitting in front of a machine and starting to type. This is our reply to the Knight who asks: What can IdoPIt will help him to recognize his Lady objectively without any risk of making a mistake. It involves the Baptism b_y Fire. The Baptism of Water, the baptism of repentance, is given before the first Threshold. This is the consecration in Hope of Salvation. The Baptism of Fire, which is the ultimate proof of purification, is given before the second Thresholdand preceding the second Birth. It is the baptism of Life, the consecration of Salvation, although it is not final as the possibility of another fall is not yet excluded. The Baptism of the Spirit is given before the third Threshold; it is the baptism of eternal Life, the consecration of final Salvation by the Holy Spirit, the Comforter. From that point on a fall will no longer be possible, 23. John ix: 4 W e must remember that whoever crosses the second Threshold and reaches the second Birth is liberated from the authority of the Absolute 111. They then enter the dominion of the Absolute I1 and so fall under the authority of the laws which rule the second cosmic octave. According to the didactic principle that we have just described, one who aspires to reach the second Threshold and finds himself beneath it must force himself to behave always as though he has already crossed. This rule must be applied to all branches of his work on the Staircase. But there is one which is most important in this sense. The power of the Absolute Ill over the exterior man is exercised by means of the sexual centre in its direct and indirect manifestation. Sexual attraction and the pleasure of the act ensure the necessary reproduction, which fills in the interval between the notes FA and MI of the second cosmic octave. Now, we must remember that within this octave the re- production of the species no longer occurs, so that the sexual act, as we know it in the third cosmic octave, is absent. The Baptism of Fire has a double meaning: a moral test and an objective effect. The two lovers, conscious of their presumably integral polarity, are called upon to straightway renounce carnal love. They must do this con- sciously and of a common accord, at the same time cultivating the Sacred fire of their Love, which then takes the form of court4 love. In this way they will tune themselves until they are in harmony with the laws which rule sexual life in the second cosmic octave. On the other hand, the Sacred fire of this Love will progressively burn away their karmic burden. In this way, says the Tradition, the foreign faces in thefilm willbe eliminated from thegame of their own accord. Circumstances will change and the obstacles will be removed. Having gone through this test of Fire, the two lovers will appear before the second Threshold purified and ready to receive the Baptism ofFire. They will then be united forever in the permanent consciousness of their integral and indissoluble unity by the act of the second Birth, the birth of their Individualit_y. For this it is necessary to withstand the test. This is hard, but the stakes are high. If the supposedly polar beings fall, this either signifies that they were not polar, or that they were not yet ripe enough for such an exploit. For them in that case, the Great Chance will be turned into a commonplace experience only a little more rich in meaning and colour than those before and after it."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Perhaps, after having rejected the divine hand stretched out towards them to unite them forever in the Light, and after the passage of time, they may bitterly regret the weakness which they then took for strength of character.
