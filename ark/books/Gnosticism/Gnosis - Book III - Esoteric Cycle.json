Initiation into the mystery of Knowledge (Connaissance). Study of the Pentagram. Numbered schemas of the Hexagram and Octogram.

EPILOGUE 227 xii PUBLISHER'S INTRODUCTION This is the third and final volume of a work that addresses many needs, but deals particularly with one IittIe-known question expressed in the idea that: 'Chrisbionity has not ken fried and failed, a1 claimed, b~f it has been fomd to be too dzgFc~Jf and has never been proper4 tried.\" This statement, of coutsc, could be true only oFa Christianity of effort; one which requires people to try fo be Christian, not one that assumes that anyone can be a Christian without the need to make effort: it is true, in other words, of an ascetic and mystical Christianity - in the sense used in the Eastern church - a Christianity that is experiential in content; for wherc there is no effort nothing can be said to be tried, and whete there is RO experience nothing can be known to have succeeded or failed. This idea, then, refers te a Christianity that is ascetical; ascetical precisely in recognizing the two ways of life and two states of being described by St Paul when he said of the first: \"nyings, murders, drunketlne~s, r~ve/Iia~s and swh like: of the which I tellyou before, andas I have also tofdyou in timt~pnrt, that they which do SYC~ things ~hdf nod inherit the kingdonom of God.' And of the second state he said: 'Bgt the fruit ofthe Spirit is love, joy, peace, loqm ffering, gentleness, goodmf~, f.. \" Boris MouravieFs Gnosis restores to the 'public domain' this spiritual tradition that depends on special knowledge, demands both experience and effort, and leads to real changes in people's consciousness and hence in their lives and their state of being. And detailed studies of the early Fathers of the Church reveal that at one time Christianity did have such a tradition of conscious transformation; the direct equivalent of the spiritual forms of Yoga in India or the Sufi doctrines in Tdam, although for more than fifteen hundred years this form of the Christian tradition has never been generalIy tried or even known about by the average Christian. Mouravjeff tells us that it was hidden from persecutors and sectarian disagreement around the third century AD, and that, as a direct result of this, although it survives in unwritten form in certain monasteries of the Eastern churches and in partial form in certain texts little known to Wcstern man, its existence has in general been forgotten by the Christian West to this day. Yet roday, as in the past, wherever this teaching is rediscovered it meets the needs of many of those who sincereIy wish to be Christian, yet have found it very difficult to transcend their own weaknesses; have fajled to become Christian in action as well as intention; even to begin to live a Christian life as Christ and His apostles lived it. Ths forgotten tradition, then, provides guidance for those Christians whose zeal outstrips their abilities and who are not satisfied to bear the name Christian without being 1. Galatians 5: 21-22."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"able to act as Christians; it awakens sleeping hearts which have not entirely forgotten what it means to wake. Such people will understand that if jt is not true on the individual scale that Christianity has never been tried, it is entirely true on the scaIe of society as a whole; that Christianity for most of its two thousand years has never been properly tried outside the cloister, the hermitage, the catacomb, and the hidden pIaces of those mystics who shun publicyty. Quite a few years ago, in his book Lost Chrisfianity, Jacob Needleman hinted that there exists or had existed a different Christianity, n form of Christianity that was more demanding and more difficult to understand, but also more functional, a 'working Christianity' in the sense that it taught something that could actually be achieved. But at the time the book was written, this question appeared to him almost unanswerable. I say 'almost', because even then the old books existed, books once built as 'bridges' by servants of higher powers to help people crass again from one river of Christianity to the other, to the living river: the mystical Christianity which Christ called the living water- but man's thinking had in the mean- time changed so much that fcw people at that time could understand such texts. Yet even one or two decades ago the information that would make this ancient reservoir of living water accessible was available to the Eng- lish-speaking world only in abstruse translations of certain texts, most of which had been translated and presented only as curiosities, translated according to modern rules of exegesis not intended to reveal the practical meaning, and so used by those who lack the practical experience or spe- ciaIist knowledge needed if the practical implications of the text were to be revealed in translation. This situation is still partially true, but in the years since the publication of Needleman's book - and beginning before it was written- some new tmnslations of early texts or of commentazjes on those early texts have emerged, while others have become better known, and there also seems to have been some small growth in the understanding of the highly technical language involved, as well as an increasing number of attempts - at varying levels of success - to explain these ideas in terms that modern man will understand. New bridges are being buiIt. Here, in volume I11 of this great work, Gnososis, Boxjs Mouravieff is most clearly revealed as the author of an outstanding example of such a text, a major bridge between past and future, and as such as being far more than a mere scholar of esoteric curiosities. In this third volume he clearly fulfils his promise to reveal the hitherto unpublished essence of the Christian esoteric tradition, making available in 'plain language' material that has only ken handed down orally or in symbdic form for millennia. Were too, he actually reveals how the symbols can be read: how this material can be used to expand the hints given by him in the earlier volumes into a full expression of the tradition. The best evidence is in the results of his work. When thjs book Gnosisis read slowly, attentiveIy, and repeatedly, and in conjunction with persistent efforts at self-observation, the ideas of the text, which at first appear intellectual, begin to change: they come alive, sometimes as we are tead- ing them we see the things they describe occurring right then in our lives, and this gives real meaning to the ancient Gospcl idea that we earlier linked to the 'second river': to that 'living water' that Jesus ptornised to the woman of Sarnaria: a river of new Iife. The way he describes what occurs within us begins to become a way of seeing what happens. The changes he describes as happening as a person evolves begins actually to occur visibly within us ... a11 in the context of a 'diffcrcnt Christianity'. In Volume I, Boris Meuravieff claims to be authorized to publish material previously only available in oral form. At the same time, the text presents itself in a neutral way, so that all In all, then, it is up to the individual, as it has always been, to decide on she truth of such statements according to some inner sense. But by the time one is well into Volume I1 one should be quite sure of this, though unable to prove it to others. Later in the book the author claims to give a 'complete' exposition of the tradition ... and emphasizes that only a complete exposition will be effec- tive. Such daims must be treated with care, yet again, if Gnosis is read several times, slowly and with sufficient attention, results must lead to conviction ... and the point of this jattoductjon is to inform all readers of the book that, as hinted at earlier, some readers are already finding such results. Yet we must also understand what Mouravjeff means by 'com- plete': in volume I1 he refers to the fact that for a long time the tradition has been so thinly represented that some elements have not survived to the present time. The historical record bears this out, with many rcfctenccs in existing texts to works that are no longer in existence; so of co~r~e the book Gnosis does not contain all the Christian esoteric teachings ever given. UnpubIished writings by the 3uthor make it clear that the book does not even contain everything taught in his course at Geneva Univetsity in thc sixties. So what kind of completeness is he claiming? Close study makes it seem that he means that the books contain a complete method: a complete prescription or rather a complete series of prescriptions by which different types of individual can progress on the way. Again, if we imagine, as so many do, that in recovering ancient teachings Mouravieff proposes a return to ancient ways- to the ways of mediaeval Russian Orthodoxy, for example-we will discover that this is not so. The book points net towards a return to a forgotten past but to a future yet unknown. Careful reading reveals passages which make it quite clear that he drew on the past only to awake a 'different future', that although xiv"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"drawing on ancient knowledge he is proposing a move toward entirely new solutions for new drnes, for the Time of Transition, as he calls it, and for the coming Era of the Holy Spirit. At the same time, in this final volume he reveals keys which have been hidden for centuries, including the keys that will enable the hard-working student to read the ancient language of mathematical symbols that encapsulate so much of the special knowledge of the esoteric tradition.

We beg the reader's indul- gence for this change in conventions. 2. Chapter XX, p. 185 AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION A t every great turning-point in history, Mart is the centd problem. Because of this, it is easy to understand that, in the time of transition jn which we find ourselves today, between the Cyde of the Son which is coming to an end and the Cycle of the Holy Spirit which is beginning, there is an imperative need for the new Man - strong and enlightened - capable of resolving the two great problems an whose solution the future of humanity depends: 1. To make the organization of human society rationaI and effective on a scale; 2. To create conditions which will offer a maximum opportunity to seekers who wish to develop their Personality and so reach the Second Birth. These problems, which are obvjously interdependent, have already been discussed in the first twovolumes of this work. Different elements of this Gnosis have been studied snd divulged by degrees so that the willing disciple may gradually grasp how important these two problems are. We will develop this by considering: -the rationalization of the political, economic and social organizatjon of I human society in an esoteric sense, which must lead to the general Resurrec- tion; jx. the incarnation at one time of all the souls attached to our planet; I -the teaching of the revealed Gnosis to form an elite of men and women of the new human type, who will be formed from individuals of all the different historical civilizing types and a11 their specific subdivisions. I n spite of the diffrcultjcs that have come from the failure inflicted on John the Baptist and Jesus, and in spite of twenty centuries of history marked by intolerance, cruelty, ineptitude and collective madness, human- ity, without enthusiasm but accotding to the nature of things, is reaching its unification. It appeats, however, that this budding unity can only be maintained and consolidated if there is a rational and harmonious regime on a global scale, and to establish such a system will require artisans of sufficient calibre. Only a social order formed on an esoteric basis will provide the States- men who will be needed tomorrow, men capable of confronting the xvi"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"probIerns arising from the organization of life in an Era characterized by a super-abundance of sources of energy - an Era where man will bc lj bcr- ated from his servitude to work which is the automatic reguiatoi and safety-valve for the frenzy of mankind. In other words, in order to regain the initiative that it has lost to the Machine it has created, human society must give birth to a new aristocracy, a NoBilr'@ of spirit and ~ervice. This must happen in the same way that, in times gone by, the Intellectuals took the place of a medieval knighthood that had become decadent. T o solve the problem of Humanity depends on a positive solution to the problem of the individual Man, and we will approach our studY of the esoteric cycle of 'Gnosis' in this order. This means that our efforts will be oriented towards the practical appli- cation of esoteric Knowledge - both for the new Man and for the new humanity as a whole. This is to help those who are predisposed to this kind of work and who burn with the desire to reach the Second Birth. Having assimilated the exotericand moterkcycIes ofthe Doctrine sufficiently, they must now be ready to serve the Cause joyfully, and to subordinate all their own interests to this end. The latter condition is imperative; if the disciple does not observe it, he will make no progress in the esoteric domain but will find himself locked in a vicious circie full of dangers. To Bwn and to Serve: this is the motto of the Knight of the new Era. Tt should be engraved in fiery letters in his heart, and be constantly present in his mind. W e must emphasize that in the end, at the time of the general Res- urrection, the human elite will be formed of polar coupIes. During the Time of transition, it is understood that Gtlosis must resolve the problem of the New Maa by progressively introducing the rule of the sing~iar romance which muss rcplace thcJrec romance normal to the prcvious Cycle and abolish all vestiges of poIygamy. Thus, Man's problem today comes back to the Andrope, which is the highest condition of human Consciousness, which crowns the efforts of the disciples and triumphs in their Second Birth. In this In#rodc(ctio~, we will put forward certain rules allowing us to determine the attitude that should bc adopted during these esoteric studies and in the practical work they contain. These will help the disciple who has xviii reached the measure of this level of teaching to better gauge his abilities and make sure that he is consciously engaged in these studies, for it is better for him not to venture too far than to have to retreat later on and run the risk of an imbalance in the psyche. T hcse general rules are dictated by the very nature of the work to be undertaken during the esoteric cycle of Gnosis. When successful, this work leads to the Initiation which consecrates the deep transformation of the disciple, who is first called upon top& oftha oldman,' then to put on the new MOYJ.' The danger of psychic imbalance arises from a lack of commitment in the Work or from a lack of will: in fact, it often happens that the disciple manages to put off the old man but does not succeed inputting on the new. His failure may be becausc he overestimates his strength, but also because of the incompetence of hs teacher; and this incompetence is sometimes coupled with ~nwillin~ness.~ The propositions that follow are not considered from the angIe of worldly motives and reasoning, but from the point of view of the per- ftct: who already belong to the new world, at least in principle and in spfdt. T he first point to be remembered by those who aspire to be initiated into the ringular romance has to do with patience. On the esoteric plane, patience and perseverance are not measured by months or years, but by decades or even lifetimes-that is, by a succession of incarnations. It js important to realjze that esoteric practice differs in a hundred ways from what we usually imagine it to be. We repeat: no-one can attain the only vivifying, true, aLjective Love without extensively modifying their Personality and its 'psychology'. And this obj@cfke Love can only be attained here below in its complete and vivifying manifestation at the time of the second Birth, by a work that js ~sef~lfo the Came, accomplished through sustained conscinus efforts. 1.

We must always keep in mind this fundamental notion: that Faith, Hopc and Knowledge (Gnosis) are she successive stages of a progressive Revelation of Love. If one or other of these is insufficjent or completely lacking at a certain stage, it cannot be obtained at the following one. In other words, without Faith in one's heart, it is irnpossibIe to attain Hope, in the esoteric sense, and without Faith and Hope, Gnosis, the living Knowledge whish finally gives access to Love, remains forever inacce~sible.~ Lastly, it is necessary to know that Faith, Hope and Gnosis together form what the Tradition calls to~rfb Loue. CourtIy Love is therefore the precursor of objective Love. I fit does not contain Gnosi~, human love, including that which contains Faith and even Hope, cannot attain the level of courtly Love. This is because the void left by the lack of Gnosis from the Absolute 11 is imme- diately filled by the intervention of the Absolute 111. This intervention is normal, and is generally desired by the common run of men, but it is undesirable for disciples of esotcricism: it genemlly Isads to marriage, with all the different worries and 'considerations' which result from this and provoke successive deviations in the imperfect disciple, dragging him into the cIosed schema of a vicious circle. As for relations outside marriage, which do not offer the Absolute IT1 the same guarantee of stabilisy as marriage, they provoke even more pronounced intervention in diffetent forms. Courtly Love is the raison d'ttre for the couple of polar beings: for the Knight and the Lady of his Dreams; without it, their polarity remains spiritually sterile and they fa13 back into the common condition. Its prac- tice, however, demands sacrifices and 'exploits'. These are fest~. For those who surmount them, the salutary effect of Gnosis is doubled: when it is enriched by experience, theoretical knowledge becomes living knowledge. In the Middle Ages, the Knight and his Lady, who considered them- selves spiritually ONE - in our terminology, polar beings - did not venture into marriage. On the contrary, they parted, accepting the risk of never meeting again and knowing that if they did not triumph wcr a hard test, their love would degenerate, losing its meaning and its marvel- lous power. They knew that, by separating from each other for an exploit, 5. Vol. I, pp. xviii % 253, Vo!. 11, pi~im. particularly pp. 61-62 and 247-250. they stood the chance, whiIe a premature marriage would be reduced to nothing. Today, as in olden days, courtly Love remains, by definition, the indis- pensable condition for the success of a supposedly polar couple who aspire to the uiuz31jling Love which is our Lord-God. There is no exception to ths ruIe: it applies to all, beginning with the couple of young and just polar beings; and it is even more obligatory between two poIar beings who meet at a mature age, when life has already burdened each of them with a karmic load. In such cases, the first ~ncrifice demanded is she renunciation of a physical relationship, and the first expIoit consists in the methodical liquidation of the respective karmic burdens, keeping in mind that the big or small 'Gordian knots' which make up these burdens must be untied, not cut. If the presumed polar beings ardently and effectively undertake some esoteric work in the same direction, useful to the Cause, the moment will come when they will be purified. Having become courtly, their Love will assume all its objective force, and in the purity rediscovered in this way, they wjll finally be convinced of the rcality of a polarity that they had felt intuitively. There is no possibility of error at this stage. At this moment, the Second Birth will unite them forever in the midst of the vivifying Love; and death, finally conquered by this, will lose a11 semblance of catastrophe for them. T he courtly Love of the Knight and the Lady of his Dreams wjll immediately place them on the fourth step of the Staircase, where their exploits and sacrifices will hasten their advance, provided that Gno- having been sufficiently assimilated by them, produces its fruits. The time they need for this end will be given them; but they wiII remain on the fourth step only if they burn with Love. Othetwise, in spite ofa promising start, they will not be able to attain the desired goal. If, on the contrary, they make some progress in their work, they will observe as they advance on the fourth step that Love changes itsplace in their physical body, their psychic body and their spiritual body, all at the same time.

But the Fifth Way does not exclude the fous other Ways described in the first two Volumes of 'Gnosjs'. The great error in the esoteric domain, which, as in alI the others, leads to failutc, is to embark on an enterprise which is above a man's capacities. The Tradition warns us about this very exactly, as has been made dear earlier. This overestimation of his strength by the disciple is a classic snare that the General Law lays for us, and many people of entirely good faith get caught in it when they could successfully have followed one of the four other Ways which do not force the disciple immediately to pass through the Trial of Fire. This is why Saint 'Paul said: '. . . he fbaf giueth (his virgin) in marriage dmtb well; btlt he that givetb ber not in marriage ddosth better!'' Ths 'doeth better' is commented upon in the Tradition as one of his references to the Fifth Way.

To conclude this Introd~ction, we must draw the reader's attention to the esoteric task and the importance of couples who are not truly polar, but who work sincerely by foIIowjng one of the first four Ways: I. On the individual plane, they contribute towards the growth and progressive development of their own Personality; 2. On the general plane, through reproduction, they contribute to the realization of the conditions necessary far the general Resurrection. Because the general Law is stronger than they are, they must avoid defying it so as not to provoke the Trial of Fire too early. 6.

Yet, until now, nobody has given any real thought to this problem. Xt is unrecognized by govern- ments and universities and generally ignored by the press. Because of the evolution of human society, this problem impresses itself on our minds without the need for any initiative from government, because this evolution accelerates every day, in every domain, to make the norms of past centuries obsolete. Several times in the first two volumes, we have called the reader's attention to the delay in man's morn1 progress compared to his rapid technical progress. Today the material means needed to rationally orga- nize the political, social and economic life of humanity are na longer lacking. What we lack is the key to the underlying significance of it 111. When we raised the problem of the new an,' we hoped - as we continue to hope-for the advent of such men in every domain ofhuman activity. It is urgently necessary that they shouId take over from the statesmen of the old school, who, apart from a few rare exceptions, do not have the moxal means - the knowledge and experience - to meet the needs of the time of transition through which we are now passing. To the long run, a situation like this can form a powerful brake on the natural. evolution of men and of things, and it may in the end threaten the very existence of the human species.2 Today, statesmen of the old school give us ample proof of their inability to rationalize and balance the life of humanity as a whole; that is, to transform the incoherent mass of peoples and States into a homogeneous organism. In pronouncing this categorical judgement, we are not simply giving way to a desire to criticize at any cost. Of course, there are certain states- men, responsible for international affairs, who are individually capable of effectively contributing toward a happy solution of the problem we have just raised. But the responsibilities of their role do not allow them to risk innovation. We must not forget that they are ministers, not prophets. IF2r 1.

However, these considerations change nothing objectiveiy, because the great problem exists and urgently demands a soIution. But It is necessary ta emphasize that the essential technical means by which we can arrive at this solution also exist today, and that those that are still lacking will be acquired with no further delay. But as well as material means, creative imagination and cowage are also necessary, and these are both missing. In the meantime human society, tormented by suspicion and fear, lives in a precarious equilibrium maintained by terror. This forces it to orient a11 its efforts toward destructive actions in order to increase its security. What is lacking in governments is aplanefay cons~iowmess which can unite and embrace the individual consciousness OF nationalities and States. These are the organs of expression of the particular birtorical citrilizing grpef that exist today .4 W e can compare the current world situation, In its scale and signifi- cance, to the one that existed at the time of transition between the Middle Ages and Modern Times. What characterized this period was the progressive disappearance of feudal, parochialism and its replacement by a nationalist consciousness, a uniting force that aas with the limits of the State. This political process has already been the object of another work of ours, en titled The problem ofmprr-state duthori~y.~ The reader may refer to thisG if he wishes to explore the question further, or if he wisher to study the role that the Unitcd Nations Organization must play. Here we will simply recall that in Europe the passage from feudalism to the centralized nationa1 State was not effected by means of a Congress of Barons or Counts -a kind of miniature UN - but through an appeal to the national con- sciousness of statehood. The new Men of that period, who possessed this until then unknown State-conscieusncss, showed themselves capable of bxingjng that time of transition to term by establishing the modern Stare. In France, the principIe artisan of this undertaking was Richelieu, and in Russia, Ivan I11 and Ivan HV were mainly responsible. On the other hand, in those cases where the nation did not produce Statesmen with a modem national consciousness that was able to dissoIve thc scparatist spirit of the feudal lords, the State ended in ruin, despite the flourishing appearance 3.

I that certain elements in the country were able to maintain. can use 1 Poland, with the high standard of individual culture that existed in the ranks of its aristocracy, as an example of the latter. Simjlarly, in spite of the creation of many leagues and alliances, ancient Greece never managed to create a homogeneous State like Ancient and Modern Rome. On the planetary scale, this process of political unification appears ana- l~gous to the unification of feudal fiefs into a nation. But here, as always, analogy is not similarity. H istory knows only two ways of realizing politicaI unification: imperi- alism andfederalism. In our days, we cannot seriously think of employing the first method, but nothing stands in the way of a rational and organic unification of the human species in the framework of a world fcderatkn. We often hear that it takes a federalist ta create a federation. This expres- sion is attractive, but it is not universally true, and it has no real force unless the word 'federalist' is used in a colIecti-e sense, or unIess it refers to prophets instead of ministers; that is, Individrcaltie~ and not simply Person- alitiex. A Collqe ofPropbefs, possessing objective consciousness, well-versed in Savoir-Faire, and with the moral means chat even the most gifted and cultured PersonaIidie~ lack, could orient human efforts toward a rational organization of the globe. W e have emphasized that analogy is not similarity, particularly in the situation we are studying. But we have yet to discover if, taking account of the above considerations, we can find a formula that will ensure the orgu~ic coexistence of peoples and States throughout the world, and guarantee true peace, sheltered from the usual hypocrisy and chimerical fabrications, and in which everyone will get what is due to him. Nations, like individuals, clamour for liberty; and it goes without saying that without liberty, no one can live, in the complete sense of that term, that is, can develop iir peace and in dignitJr. The transition from feudalism to the modern State, crowned by the French Revolution of 1789, was carried through under the banner of the ideas expressed by the triple formula: Liberty, Eq~uli~, Fraftrnig, which has conquered the world."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Yet, strange as it may seem at firs< today this formula appears out of date: after a long period of gIory in which it enfl amed hearts and aroused men's passions, it now seems only a shadow of itself, drained of its sub- stance and incapable of reviving the same enthusiasm it aroused in the past. To understand this phenomenon better, ae will study the manifest historica1 meaning of the three terms in question, and see where they have led human society after having served it during a whole heroic period. At first, the idea of liberty was generally seen from a legal point of view, and this meant that people conceived it as a sight. Shaken in 1789, and faced with conservative resistance, it immediately took on the dynamic: character of a military demand. Since then, by grant or conquest, liberty has been permitted within the limits defined by law or by treaties and conventions. L iberty, as we know it, has been criticized more than once, For example, it has been maintained that the 'emancipated' have not usudly been granted the means to exercise the rights accorded them. The whole pro- cedure is then without meaning, and hardIy more than a theoretical con- ception. This is, in fact, liberty for a chosen few and not for alI, in other words a return to the aristocratic or oligarchic principle under a demo- cratic facade. It is also said that the principle of Equality is purely imaginary, since Nature in all its manifestations is founded on a diametrically opposite principle, which also applies so the human species: that of inequality. In reality, the proclaimed equality is generafiy reduced to the equality of citizens in the eyes of the law, and even then the facts do not always support the theory. Of course, it would be absurd to expect something perfect in the imper- fect world in which we live, so it would be more realistic to look for transient value than for perfection, as everything changes with time, and even the meaning of ideas may change. The formula Liberg, Egudio, Frafernidy is a battle-cry, As such, it contributed greatly to the accompljshment of the transition to contem- porary History in modern Times, but with the decolonization which is now happening before our eyes, it is losing all topical interest and so has lost its historical significance. The present situation requires a new formula, a call not to war but to a rational organization of life in the framework of the liberty which has aJseady effectively been won. In this perspective of the future, the mot to Liberty, Eqivaiig, Fratemip, seems outmoded and even illogical. Today as yesterday, Liberg has an aggressive sense, Equaliiy is shaky, and Fraternity is enveloped in a framework of pompous declarations. This docs not mean, however, that we should reIegate this motto to some limbo of the mind. On the contrary, it is possible to revive it, even gloriously, if we reconsider it in the anagrammatic spirit dear to antiquity and to the Middle Ages. Indeed, as a watchword it would be more appropriate to the present and the future if it were read backwards, that is, in the following order: Let us suppose that, through some marvellous procedure, the great prjncipIe of Fraternity becomes a universal reality. Whst repercussions would this have? In the first place, violence in all its forms would be rejected as immoral. Fraternity would gradually heal individuaIs and peoples, whether they suffer from an inferiority or superiority complex, and it would definitely condemn that vestige of the tribal mentality that is known as racial pre- judice. The practical application of the principle of Fraternity would not change the face of the world at one stroke. Misbehaviour, abuse, weakness, and incomprehension- that plague of the human specjes-would continue for some time to come. But even if it did not immediately change everything, Fraterniry would change our attitude toward the excesses and weaknesses that exist in our political, economic and social life, so that they became less and less frequent. The procIamation and glorification of the principle of Fraternity would not be chimerical acts, but on the contrary would reptesent a very realistic enterprise that historical evolution approves and demands. Judiciously applied, this principle would prevent some 'powers of this world', and certain industrialists and financiers who only worry about their own inter- ests, from getting the peoples involved in war. Besides, racial prejudice being stigmatized, if the conceit of some people b diminished they wiII no longer offend the pride of othexs, and a natural equilibrium will thus be established. Rooted in the consciousness of peoples and States, the great principle of Fraternity would bc the best and only rcal guarantee of Equality on both nationaI and international planes, and in both social and political fields. Would Liberty not then seem the logical consequence of this new state of things? It therefore seems evident that the primary element in the national and international legal systems of today and tomorrow should no longer be Liberty, but Fraternity, which, in the historical evolution of human Consciousness, forms the cornerstone of the individual and social moral- ity of civilized peoples."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"A 11 this seems very beautiful, the realistic reader may say, but hew can we make the principle of Fraternity into a practical reality, so that it becomes an active force in the customs of peoples and States? Let us try to answer this question. First, it is important so understand that we have no intention of studying or discussing different political theories, for whether we profess capitalist or communist ideas, whether we are 'liberal' or 'reactionary', the brutal fact remains that technical progress has drawn people out from their former isolation: enclosed in a world whose limits have suddenly shrunk, they are being led mechanically toward unity. Unexpected and still misunderstood, this new fact entaiIs new require- ments for peoples and States. Threatening cataclysm, it demands from man an urgent and radicaI re-evaluation of values, notably the abandon- ment of worn-out standpoints and of methods that do nor work. From this point of view, Marxism and Capitalism are already part of History, since technical progress has led to a unity which already clamours for the adop- tion of new forms of coexistence between peoples and States. And here, we recall again that the feudal State ceased to exist because the national consciousness was stronger than provincial consciousness, although it did not eliminate the latter. This gave birth to States whose central power was strong enough to impose order and peace within a country. Having understood the call of the times, geniuses like Richelieu anticipated and prepared the way for the evolution of the elite. This explains why the unity of the French people was established only in the followjng century, by a constituent AssembIy which abolished feudal privileges and proclaimed the sovereignty of the natjon, the separation of legislative, executive and judicial powers, and finally, the access of all citizens to public office, and their equality before the Iaw. Originating from s newly conquered and bitterly defended Liberty, these rights were no more than the subconscious expression of a Frater- nity restricted within the framework OF the nation. This was the process of transformation that interests us. At present, in spite of certain disturbances we are aware of, on a world- wide scale the elite are approaching a psychological condition which may be compared to that which animated the deputies of the constituent Assembly in 1789. Tn all the four corners of the world, these men belonging to the elite know in their inmost heart that the present world regime, with its watertight compartments between States that are full of mistrust and jealousy, has lost its rairon d'2tre. I The divine principle of Fraternity, which once transformed the feudal States into national States working through the human subconsciousness, continues towork on the minds of men. Today, however, it is operating on the consciousness of the elite on a higher plane and on an international 0 n a limited scale the population of the multinational States presents an nnalogy with that of the population of the world seen as a whole, and the history of these States provides us with valuable examples. The first is that they show that application of the principle of federoiism can- and does-lead to positive results. Conversely, the negative principle that previously governed ancient Poland, with the jree veto and the constitu- tionaI right to begin civil war under certain conditions, led to the ruin of the State. We might properly compare this anarchic kind of national regime with the international law of the past century, which gives full sccognition to the 'right of conquest', a formula which is anarchic in principle and based on the balance of opposed forces ready to act at any moment, a balance that is fragile in its nature and adds up to no more than the right of the strongest. The new international legal system developed from the United Nations Charter is still in an crnbqonic state and ineffective. This is because we always look for solutions of the problems on the interstate plane when It would be better to look for them on the supra-state level -just as one combats provincial rivalry by appealing to the highest national authority. If we cornpare humanity as a whole to the population of a State, with the individual in the same place in both examples, we must recognize that, scale. 1 ~mcver, the UN has not yet become an organ which is able to faithfully I express this principle. Indeed if we consider the gteat metamorphoses are taking pIace at this worId-wide juncture, and contrast them the weakness of the transformations which are supposed to wire- spend to them in the modern system of international law, we cannot help 1 a marked discordance between, on the one hand, the structure and watks of the UN, and on the other, events and the precipitate march of time. Recent events only serve to emphasize this fact, since the United Nations Organization should not only dress wounds, but should effec- ( tively prevent bloodshed. We have already pointed out that the Organization's weakness is the direct consequence of a basic internal contradiction. This lies in the fact that although the charter was proclaimed in the name ofpeapler, the reali- zation of its contents was left to theirgovemmeats: this is not the same thing."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"proportionally, these states of the present time are analogous on a global scaIe to the fiefs ofthe Middle Ages. This comparison led to the appearance of the UN as a kind of gwerntprentol organization, like an imaginary con- ference of feudal lords, with no real pawex. It would be inane to try and apply the principIe of imperialism to unify humanity today - not to mention the fact that this idea involves the creation ofpolice states and Gtsfapor of all kinds. The only other possibiIity is to try to discover under what practical conditions we would be able to apply the unifying federalist principIe. History gives us a few convincing examples, especially that of multinationa1 States: first, the old Helvetian Confederation whose sovereign cantons later made up a federated State, and in more recent times, the Soviet union.\" The question then is whether one can be inspited by these examples of federalism which have stood the test, of time in the first case, and of invasion in the second, so as to solve the problem posed by the present lack of international judicial order. It is necessary to note that modern legal thought is not oriented in this direction. The search for a source of authority over separate states should not tend toward the establishment of a statalike superstructure; this would be senseless, and would only create a vicious circle. The search should be simply transferred to another pIane, abandoning state or inter-state planes and turning toward the very source of public power: the popufor vote. W ithout losing touch with realities, how in practice could one intro- duce the question into the general framework of the United Nations, granted that the latter must ever~tually become universal? Can the example of those multi-national States with a fedetal constitution Ix imitated on a world-wide scale, and in what way? Could the patallel Swiss or Russian bicameral system be introduced in the UN? Would this make it more effective? It seems clear enough that, alongside the present general Assembly of States, the creation of a second general Assembly -that of Peoples- with the precise function of expressing the principle of human Fraternity, would modernize the international legal system and give it uncontested authority. Possessing equaI rights, and going into session at the same time and in the same place, these two Chambers together would form the 7. The fotaed Fedtralism of the Communist Soviet Union has since disintegrated, but the United States may wcll MNC ktter as a working cxarnplc. (Ed.) supreme Assembly of the United Nations, similar to the Swiss federal 1 Assembly or to the Supreme Council of the USSR. I This would re-establish the proper balance between the traditjonalist expressed by the Assembly of States, and the innovative one centred on the People's Assembly. For although each delegation comes to the present general Assembly with a definite mandate from its govern- ment, from which it cannot depart, the representatives at the general Assembly of Peoples would not be bound in this way. They would prob- 1 abIy form groups. These would not necessarily be based on their belong- ing to some particular State or group of States. On the international plane, an Assembly of this kind would then be a true organ for the expression of world-wide public opinion and of the principle of human Fraternity. Separately, according to this idea of modernization, each of the two Assemblies of the UN could only make reconme~d~tions as at present. On the other hand, their combined vote during a joint session of the S~preme As~embly af the Utrited Nations would naturally be decisive. owever, all the differences between the States cannot disappear in a single stroke: we must let Time do its work. We may, perhaps, begin I by convening porlidmcntory delegations to the People's Assembly; and almost imperceptibly we would reach the point of holding direct elections with proportional representation. The essential point is that the structure of the UN would then be in I harmony with the new rhythm of political and social life characterized by a continually greater interpenetration of affdrs within and between states. This would be accompanied by the growing influence of economic and social factors on truly political questions, and in general by a progressive I - I interpenetration of the factors and influences which together make up modern public life - national and internationa!. A structure like this demands real Liberty, not one that is conditional or controlled, but one founded on the principle of Fraternity, and blossoming in a cIimate I of effective Equality. Logjcally, this is the only possible way of organizing human society according to the natural flow of its historical evolution. I B ut even if it won the votts of indivjd~als all over the world, it seems improbable that this formula could be put into practice under the Present international regime. The spirit of governments is aIways conser-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"vative, even with a government formed afrer a politicaI ot social revelu- tion. So it is doubtful that thc General Assembly of the United Nations, the assembly of all the States, would risk modifying the Charter in this direc- tion according to the provisions of its Anide 109. We must admit that this prudence is in a certain sense understandable, as extremist tendencies in the first Peoples' Assemblies could exacerbate the present international ten- sion and cause it to explode instead of reducing it. A high standaxd of intellectual culture, even if rcinfotccd by vast experi- ence, would not be sufficient to control the situation. We can ensure the success of the transformation we envisage only on the basis of Lwe; and especially low of our fellow men, something that is unknown to men who still do not know exactly what it means to love one's neighbow. This is why Statesmen of the old school will not even be abIe to begin this debate. The new international politics can only be conceived and led by New Men-the Propbats we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. But in the meantime, it is important to fix the objective and point out the way of Salvation. CHAPTER 11 T he txansition from one era to another is plunging the world into a critical situation. Analpsing thi.s situation, we have come to the con- clusion that the immediate cause of the troubled period of history that humanity is now passing through is materid in nature. It has to do with the industrial, or more exactly, the efiergy revolution which has successively substituted steam, electricity, and nuclcar cncrgy for the simplc human and 3nirnaI power that were until then the only sources of energy other than the wind. This revolution means that man now has aIrnost unlimited sources of energy at his disposal. It is difficult to judge their magnitude, but the considerable repercus- sions sf this revolution are forcing us into a direction which is, in pdndple, that which should be taken by the new humanity. F irst, we must analyse the moterial consequences of the present crisis, which is a result of advances in technology that have transformed the world's structure. Then we will study the deeper meaning of this crisis which, as we have already shown, is of a moral order. What will the new humanity be like, or what can it become? This is what we will try to outline in the present volume. We can already point out some mljor consequences of this transformation, though these constatations are in no way limiting. First constatation - The new means of transport and communications have changed our sen~ afdrstance. No inaccessible places exist today: thc world has narrowed down; the antipodes have become neighbours, and distances ate no longer calculated in miles or kilornetres, but in the units of time required to reach such and such point. Here are a few distances expressed in terms of time taken before the coming of the railways: (days) ....... Paris - Saint Petersburg (express mail) 17 Rome - London (express mail) ............. 13 ................. Rome - Saint Petersburg. 30 ................... Berlin - Northern Inly 10 .......................... Vienna - Berlin 5 Berlin - Spanish frontier. ................. 15"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"In comparison, the air trip from London to New York now takes four hours. The smaller the world becomes, she more our contacts become obliga- tory, frequent and close. This is the first consequence of the technical revolution: it requires a complete reassessment of the problems tbat arise from relationships between States and between individuals, Second ~ot~sfutation- The perfecting of machinery requires the use of raw r~laterialr from all over the world: the automobile industry alone uses more than two hundred different types of material. Because of this ever-larger economic community of interest, we have lost our independence. Third comtatation - Mechanization t eads to mass production, which, by modifying the law of supply and demand, gives rise to the problem of marketing, then that of overproduction. Fo~rtb ronstatafioion - Thus, as manufacturing becomes the norm, this leads to the unification of civilization: films, tape-recorders, gramo- phones, radio and television, the architecture of buildings, etc. In its turn, this obvious tendency toward a homogeneous civilization leads to standardization of academic teaching, This is inevitable, because the same or similar problems arise everywhere, and demand similar solutions. Fiffb con~tafafian-Today, man has the use of means that could not even be imagined a century ago. Mass-production, which seems so natural to him with modern equipment, is a result of the ever faster growth of possibilities. The result is that problems such as the abolition of suffering could be resoIved today in a practical way. But there are two sides to every coin: this technical power, which could be a blessing fur humanity, can also lead to frightful catastrophes. T he development of international co-operation, which was desirable earlier, has now become indispensable. For the reasons just stated, States are now obliged to sohe their problems on the international plane. They can no ionget simpIy act within a nationaI framework. In turn, this interdependence logically calls for collaboration between peoples. However, although the world is progressing rapidly towards unity on the tecbnicaJplane, it is still formed of States, and on thepolificrllplane these regard themselves as sovereignpersomIitie~. This is not a question of some- thing artificial: every nation is a solid reaIity that b deeply rooted, but this fact is obviously in opposition to the consequences of the technical revo- lution. Today, we see nationalities establishing themselves in an increasingly passionate way, and this phenomenon is developing on two planes: a) on the rwfacc, as a result of decolonization; b) il~ depth, because of its acute and dynamic character all over the world. In the final analysis, this contradiction leads to two different processes: the technical revolution urgently calls for the establishment of an international order which, if not a single unit, is at least unified. Opposed to this in many peoples we can constate the rapid and powerful develop- ment of a national consciousness which sometimes escalates into xeno- phobia. These opposed processes threaten to tear our human soclet a art. Y we previously pointed this out in the second volume of this work, where we suggested a theoretical solution to the problem. We have repeated this %gain in the first chapter of the present volume: the question is to find out how to move from theory to practice. The underlying cause of these difficulties lies in the face that the two processes are unfolding on different planes of human consciousness. The technical process is of interest on the plane of ciuili~afion, while the second is taking place on the c~~ltwcll plane, according to the definitions we have given of these two terms.' We will repeat them here so that the reader nay follow our explanation more easily. By c11Ifw6, we mean everyt3ing on the spiritual plane and the plane of the psyche, which properly, and in an original way, belongs to the whoIe of a civilizing type. It must be understood, of course, that within this whoIe, each of the associated peoples is the bearer of a spec@ culture tbat is il component of the cultural content of the given bi~torisal civiii~ing gpe. By recognizing the irreplaceable cultural genius of a people, this manner of seeing things assigns then true historical worth to all peoples, big or small. It follows that moral progress necessarily depends on the mlf~(raI evolution of humanity. By civiliq:ation, we mean a11 the results obtained by technical progress, in the widest sense of this term. It follows that the specific eIement: of cuIture always springs from the Wional consclousness, in the broadest sense of the term; whereas civiliza- tion, during its development, naturally tends to become international, and ends by embracing the whole world. T hese definitions explain the double process in which the universal internationalization, which is the logical result of the technical revo- lution, is opposed by an ever-growing assertion of national consciousness In all peoples, big or small, free, colonial or semi-coIoniaI.

This neglect led to the formation of a chimerical idea ofthe difference between ciuiked people and 'savages', a word with which we sometimes describe peoples who have attained a very high degree of culture - alhough different from ours -but whose civilization did not develop at the same pace as in the West. With time, this error has come to be regarded as a truth in the minds of most Westerners. By accepting Voltaire's deism, and by introducing the deification of the Personality established by the French Revolution into our psyche, we have ended by attributing to kivili~rftion' the meaning and value of 'cuJtw~', and, as we have seen, culture always belongs to a parti- cular nation, and can only deveIop within the framework of national liberty and independence. However paradoxical it may seem, it is actually the development of the Western civilization, and its propagation thxough- out the world, which has created the necessary conditions for the establish- ment of this nationai indqendence all over the globe. W e must now study the growth of ruItrrrt in all its varied national aspects. As we have seen, these aspects are specific, and all have equal value. We will add that this equivalence is the best expression of the Froternig of humankind, which is no more than a fact of Nature, although it has been neglected or violated in the course of millennia. This crisis, in which humanity finds itself as a result of its ignorance or negligence, can be resolved onIy if ell peoples become conscious of this fact. The mltural source of every nation is tradifi01:aI. It t s the spirit of thepeople that is the depository of the cultural treasure which is expressed in the national language and literature. We can observe that the structure of the language is always original up to the phonetic alphabet, but is aIways changed a little when it comes to the written alphabet. The seventy-two original tongues which appear in the myth of the Tower of Babel, with their subdivisions, form between them the great receptacIe of the ~miver~al tuftwe of which each is only a specific aspect. Above these seventy-two original tongues, there is a UniversalLanguage on which a11 of them are based, the language of Numbers: this is the divine tongue, the instrument of expression of the Word, of the L~oI, the source of the absolute Truth from which the seventy-two draw their vitality, so that each separately may form a national Individ~ulity by bringing to it its own originality. Here, we are touching on the esoteric plane. Further on, we will see that, in this sense, the Era of the Holy Spirit will be characterized by the return of different peoples to their traditional sources in order to finally form a Unity. United in all its legitin~ate vari- ety, each national Individuality will be an jntegral part of the barn~o~iour Whole which will then be re-established. Symbolically, this will 'he a return to the Tower of Babel, but in the opposite direction: an integral renaissance of all, the historical civjlizing types in a return toward mutual comprehension based on a revealed and assimilated Gnosis. This would be the blossoming of national cultures in the framework of a unified world civilization - an expression of the great principle of human Fraternity."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CHAPTER I11 W e cannot compare any other turning-point in history with the pre- sent one. Since the Flood, the only one as important as this was the one for which Saint John the Baptist prepared, which Jesus and His Apostles helped humanity to face. However, other less important changes can serve as historical precedents, and even if they are not exact models, they can provide us with valuable clues, revealing factors which were decisive in the accomplishment of certain works - some of which go beyond the limits of what is generally acknowledged as humanly possi- ble. And it is precisely this transcending of the human norm which is of interest to US. We include in these works those of Alexander the Great and Peter the Great. In each case, the legends of these personalities and their heroic actions have not totally eclipsed the true image. Tf we cannot penetrate into the depths of their souls, we can closely observe the imputes that drove them and guess the esoteric source of their clainroyance and super- human energy. Taking known facts as a basis in this way, we can develop an idea of how superhuman forces intervene in the routine course of human history. Historical science is hardly concerned with this epic side of Alexander or Peter, as this question is not within the objective of its studies. The ques- tion is not raised by history, but by psychology, philosophy, and especially esoteric philosophy. I t is curious to note that once their work was achieved in broad outline, both Peter and Alexander were suddenIy removed by illness at the height of their triumph, when they had been exposed all through their lives to the greatest dangers when they were involved in military opera- tions. Although Alexander had been wounded a few times, Peter had always come out without a scratch. The aim of the present chapter is to give to the reader who has already assimilated the contents of first two volumes of 'Gnosis', a clear picture of these twogreat builders of civilization whose iron will, guided by a higher cQnsciousness, changed the course of History to advance the world, in both cases for three centutics, toward the great turning points that mark the Passages between Cycles.

We refer to Ulrich Wilcken's work, which has a preface by Professor Victor Martin, formerly rector of Geneva university.' This preface ends with the passage that we are about to reproduce here, as it will give the reader an idea of a work that was remarkable from every point of view, and especiaIly from the esoteric point of view which interests us most. Of the author of this work on the genius who inaugurated a very important phase of world history, the Hdlenisric civilization, Victor Martin writes: 'He has accomplished this task, not only as a great historian, but still more as a man for whom the contemplation of the past orients and nourishes the meditation of the present. When we consider the way in which he reveals certain aspects of his hero's career, we feel that he is establishing a comparison with certain circumstance in our most recent history. These discreetly indicated parallels and their conclusions - sug- gested instead of formulated - always lead to reflections, and these are sometimes contradictory: the dialogue this creates between the author and the reader will not be the smallest profit that the latter will draw from his interchange with this scholarly biographer of Alexander the re at.'^ L et us now see what Professor Ulrich Wilcken says of Alexander and his work. En the Introdf(cfion to his book, he sketches the following por- trait of his hero: 'Alexander the Great belongs to the small minority of men who have inaugurated a new period jn universal history. He is perhaps the only one who imprinted the mark of his personal will on the world with such force that the evolution of humanity remained under his influence for several centuries - a phenomenon which is even more astonishing because Alex- ander died before the age of thirty-three ... His passage on this earth left ... something more durable than the empire he conquered by the sword and by bl aod : the bI!os~orning of #he Creek civifiption into a u~orld cii~ifi~abion~ of which he was the founder ... But it was undoubtedly necessary to create the empire first, for here, as always in world history, ie was the decision on the battlefields which oriented the development of the civilization. 1.

The italics arc the author's. .We are discussing this to discover which forces dominate history: Alex- ander is an emphatic proof of the decisive importance of theper~o~aii~. We =annot study a genius like Alexander apart from his 'milieu', nor can he be considered as simply a product of his time and his country. Certainly, like all men, he was subject to the conditions of time and place, but his genius followed its own ways which, without him, the natural development of his century and of his country would never hare followed. Without a doubt, like all great leaders, he also followed thecurrents that ruled his epoch; but he did not always let himself be carried away by their waves; when they were contrary to his own ideal, he struggled against them with all his strength. 'Before him, in the fourth century, we may already notice certain phe- nomena and movcrnents that may be considered as precursors of the Heli'eniftir age - that transformation of classjcal Hellenism of which he was the initiator-but these, to be precise, were onIy harbingers; it was he who made them blossom, yet they show that, from many points of view, AIexander was the man that his era a~aited.'~ L et us now study the conclusions drawn by the author of this rematk- able work. In chapter IX: 'A retrospective glance at Alexander's work', Ulrich Wilcken expresses himself thus: Wmnder was not even thirty-three years old when he died. He was cut down in his prime like his ancestor and model Achilles. His reign had not lasted thirteen years. A gIance at his gigantic work puts us in the presence of a unique genius, a marveIIous mixture of vehement passion and clear, cold reflection. Endowed with an iron wjll, this man of action, whose policy was most redistic, also possessed certain irrational tendencies, such as that 'nostalgic attraction' toward the unexplored and the mysterious which, along with his will to conquer and his taste Eor scientific discovery, finally led him to the farthest limits of the inhabited world. His conviction that he was a descendant of HeracIes and Achilles also belonged to the order of irrational imponderables. It was this living faith that gave him so much mettle, and so much strength. Religious, not given to philosophica1 criticism, he was firmly persuaded that the gods had taken him under their Personal protection, and so he believcd in his mission. Rcccntly, in an important conference on Aficient ~tsrltqy,~ the following aphorism was voiced: \"It is characteristic of the great men of antiquity that they con- sidered all their acts to be inspired by divinity.\" This applies to Alexander 4- OP- tit-. pp. 1516. 5.

When the prophet hailed him as Ammon's son, he took it as a simple statement of fact, an affirmation of the divine force that lived in him. 'This was also why he could later ask the Greeks to recognize the sacred element in him, and demand that they accord him the honours due to a divinity. This unshakeable faith in his mission inspired him with the absolute certainty that he would conquer. Without recognising this we could never understand his actions. The supernatural powct with which he was endowed enabled him to dominate men. 'The genera1 and the Statesman are closely linked in AIexander, far, as Commander-in-Chief, he executed his own po1itica:al will. The genera1 in him is mare understandable, for he completed this part of his work, while at the time of his death the political tasks were still unfinished. Alexander was the type of king-commander who had unlimited power over his people and over the resouxces of his country, and who was responsible to no one but himself. He did not have to fear those 'trials of generals' that the Attic democracy loved to stage in order to acquit itself of all guilt. As the head of the Corinthian League, he was shielded from all military criticism, even by the synedrion. Besides this, Alexander was fortunate enough to inherit from his father the best army in the world. A great general himself, he initiated his son in the art of war, and left him a compzny of well-trained officers. These favourabIe circumstances helped Alexander develop his military genius to the maximum, but the main point was that he had genius ... among his great military qualities, one must not forget ... the tenacioirs perseYercIPte with which he completed whatever he judged to be necessary. He stayed seven months at the gates of Tyr before he conquered it. This small example should be sufficient to prevent us from drawing a parallel between Alexander and Pyrrhus as so many have already done, in antiquity as today; for Pyrrhus was always vacillating: he abandoned the siege of Lilybee after only two months, and hls whole Sicilian expedition came to naught as a result. 'Alexander proved himself to be a great leader. He knew how to draw his troops after him by participating with them in work and in danger. In battle, he gave them the example of great personal courage. On the long marches, he shared their fatigue. During the sieges, if there were boats to build or other tasks of this nature, he always put his hand to the work. He encouraged the good workers and punished the lazy. When a great victory was won, he took pleasure in rewarding his troops by organizing games, competitions and other festivities. He paid his army handsomely in money as compensation for the rule which forbade them to pillage a conquered country ... 'Alexander is more difficult to know and judge in his role as Statesman, since his political ideas were still in development when he died ... Not one of his political creations took a definite form, and new projects were farever springing from his indefatigable mind. It is impossible to con- ceive how the face of the world would have changed had he Bved ten or twenty years more. We would then have quite a different judgement of his work in his youth - of aLl that he accomplished before the year 323! We must, therefore, never forget that we are dealing only with beginnings. me last ward was never said.'\" T his quotation from Wilcken's book gives us a faix idea of the greatness of Alexander and of his work, as well as of the impossibility of explaining this in terms of what we generally recognize as h~mafib possi- ble, that is, in exoteric terms, Thc same characteristic marks the work of Peter the Great. peter and Alexmder had the same kind of mentality even in the smaIIest details. For example, both these men showed a hostility toward conven- tion, visible, for example, in their unwillingness to wear a beard, consid- ered in those times to be a sign of virility and masculine elegance. Before considering Peter's work, let us return to that of Alexander. We will look at it from the esoteric point of view which Ulxich Wilcken has neglected. It is interesting to note that an appreciation of this kind was given tacitly during Alexander's lifetime, since his superhuman nature was generaFIy recognized: he was given the title of son of Arnmon, and divine honours were attributed to him, as they sometimes were to heroes OF the Hellenic world, We are so distant from that epoch, and we Iive in such a different civilization, that we cannot imagine the value of these honours, but we know that the centuries immediately afterwards recognized them. Certain primitive Christian Churches looked upon Alexander as a saint, For what precise reason, and in consideration of which part of his work, did they raise him to this rank? On reflection, the reply to this question seems quite clear: it is because, three centuries before Christ's Advent, Alexander was responsible for the creation of the Hellerristic world that was to become the cradle of Chris- tianity. Jesus said to the Jews: Didye newr read in th~ ssrigtwe~, The ~fone which the builders rejected, the Jme is become the head offbe comer: this if the Lord's doing, atfd it i.r tnaruel/ous in our yes2 Therefore ~q Ilmtoyo~, Th Kiqdom of God shall be taksn fromyo~~, andgiven a rratioion bringitrgforfb tba fr~itx fhert~$~ 6.

Is it not clear that the timely appearance of this world of consider- able vastness, and jts development at the time of the advent of Jesus and of his failure due to the denial by the chosen people, was the marvellous thing of which the Prophet spoke? The SacrIfite was only a s~bsfifwtion fo~mula in case of failure: the Hellenistic world, established by Alexander, was the rtcep- tncle which received this Satr@ce, the propitious sail on which the seed, sown by the Son of God appearing as the Son of Man, would be fruitful. This is indeed 'the Lord's doingp.' It would not be too daring to affirm that Alexander was Christ\" fore- runner on the political and cultural planes, as was John the Baptist on the spiritual plane. That is as far as his work is concerned. As for the man, if we interpret the word saint in the way it was interpreted at the time of the early Churches, the fact that he was recognized as a saint by the early Churches, and later, by Islam, shows that he belonged to the esoteric plane: in other words, Alexander came into the world charged with a mission. For this, he had te be an Individualig, and not simply a Personality. From the esoteric point of view, this was equally true of Peter the Great. Jt is not our intention to outline Peter's characteristic traits, as we have done for Alexander, for in this sense there are parallels between the two heroes, and a comparative study of the two Individmiitie~, all proportions retained, reveals striking resemblances. Although in the end both had the same significance, their respective tasks were undertaken in opposite directions, so to speak. Alexander introduced the Hellenic culture to a vast portion of the world, which included the Orient and the Occident., and this world became Hellenirtic. Peter, on his side, cultivated Science on Russian soil - the same Science that came from ancient Greece at a time whcn Russia was piously imbibing the esoteric Tradition and putting it safely aside in the crypts of traditional Orthodoxy- an Orthodoxy that was jealously defended and preserved through the centuries, in spite of storms, political catastrophes, invasions, and the Mongol yoke which lasted two hundred and fifty years. It is easy to see that the two heroes worked in opposite directions: a disciple of Aristotle, and the bearer of the most developed culture and most brilliant civilization of that time, Alexander spread both civilization and culture by force of arms. He was also himseIf a sowre of cultural values. The best proof of this is the famous Prayer of Opis, in which, after his victory, Alexander expressed the wish that beside general prosperity, - 8.

Thjs work met needs that arose only three centuries after his death, they had been prophesied through a 'miracle of the Lord' seven centuries earlier ... Though their characters greatly resembled one another, Peter, unlike Alexander, was self-made. Me had to rely entirely on himself to accomplish his work. To meet the urgent needs of national defence, he had to mod- ernize the army, and create the navy and the whole arsenal of war. When he came to the throne, Russia was at a high level, c~ffwaI~ speaking -especjally its spiritual culture. If this had not been the case, the Russian people could never have presexved their national consciousness or that of the State, ftom which flowed the decisive force that enabled it to triumph against all invasions and maintain itself as an entity. But this culture was leading toward a sort of'kitai~rn','O as they used to say in those days. The best minds realized this and knew that Russia lacked the element of civi- lixatiotion. Feter's task was to re-establish this equilibrium. The intellectual development and technical progress that had been realized in Europe since the Renaissance, as well as the military experience built up during the whole of the Thirty Year's War, had placed Russia in a state of material inferiority. This situation was becoming dangerous, and there was a dan- ger that centuries of effort on the spiritual plane might be annihilated by a show of strength from the West. Awaxe of this gulf even in his early youth, Peter found himseIf faced by a problem that was humanly insoluble: to learn first, and afterwards to teach others, each according to his inclina- tion. His will, like Alexander's, knew neither insurmountable barriers nor crises of discouragcment like those Justjnian the Grcat experienced. Tt was necessary to act in stages. The first problem was to educate himself, and to create the embryo of a modern army. Peter set out to do this at she age llJ'jowrteen. The motto engraved on his seal as Tsar gives us an idea of the work he undertook at that time of his life: I class my~eIfas the siwdents and I call for feuchess. Yet, above all, Peter was a self-made man. His insatiable desire to know and to obtain savoir-faire made him a great Statesman, organizer and diplomat in the grand style as well as a great general and admiral. Percep- tive and realistic, he was a clever politician and originated the principle of '~olitics of intetest'. This strategist was also a mathematician, a civil and engineer, and figured among those who fur the first time outlined a of naval construction.

Peter\" smother, the Czarina Natalie, was far from being Olympias' equal. According to a historian of the time,'' she was 'incapable of ruling'. From where, then, did he get these extraordinary qualities? The question remains, for attempts to answer it by rational means always lack certain details. This is why all attempts to explain this phenomenon in a logical way are incomplete and do not hold up. As KEioutchevsky said, to judge Peter's work clearly, one must admit that he was born with the plans fox his Reform 'ready-made in hs head.' Voltaire gives US the best portrait of the Reformer. I-le was Peter's contemporary and outlived him by fifty years. This enabled him to follow the Emperor's work from its beginnings and to judge its effects half a century after Peter's death, when he published its history. Voltaire's work has a special value, for the author was as great as his hero. A philosopher himself, Voltaire was the first to acknowledge Peter, not only as a hero, a legislator, and a diplomat, but also as a great philo- sopher. Voltaire's qualities-particularly the greatness of his mind -give his analysis a quality of impartiality inaccessible to historians with a political background.\" Without resolving the enigma of Peter the Great, Voltaire presented him in an impressive way. 'What is most aston- ishing,' he said, 'is thc small hope that mankind must have had to scc a man like Czar Peter born in Moscow. There was one chance in a million, nay, 11. In Prttr the Great?

And there was only one chance in sixteen million, the number of Russians that were alive then, that nature's lot should fall on the Czar. Yet it happened.\"\" Further on, Voltaire wrote: 'Today this Empire is counted among the most flourishing States, and Peter is among the ranks of the greatest legislators. Although his enter- prises did not have to meet with success in theeyes of the wise, his successes have forever reinforced his glory. We think today that Charles XI1 de- served to be Peter the Great's first soldier. Yet one left only ruin behind him, the other is a builder in every field. Thirty years ago, when I wrote Charles' history, 1 dared to make nearly this very same judgement. The memoirs from Russia which I have today, enable me to make known this empire, whose peoples are so old, but whose laws, customs and art are a new creation. Charles XII's story was amusing, but peter's is instructi~e.\"~ hat escaped Voltaire, who was not Russian - and what sometimes W escapes even Russian historians - is precisely the fact that Peter's genius was in no way 'contrary to the genius of his people.' In reality, Peter was the bearer of the integral ~onsEiousne~s of the people who gave birth to him, and this in nvo foxms: historical and dynamic, the second being organically linked with the first. He was the focal point of the tendencies and historical aspirations of the Russian people, of the traditions of the Slavonic race and the whole Orthodox-Hellenistic world. With the spirit of synthesis and fusion of the latter, Peter incarnated Russia through his genius, which was simultaneously abstract and yet practical, as we11 as throrxgh latent energy that he transformed into a dynamism that knew no insurmountable obstacles. Even physically, over six foot tall and with Herculean strength, he symbolized this immense empire of peoples of which he was elected Czar, and of which he became father and emperor. W e do not wish to extend the bounds of this chapter, sowe will not go into Peter's Reform in detail.

When we consider the Reform superficially, we often overlook the fact that it was rr&rousIy y~femafic. Peter adapted his pIans to circumstances: sometimes he modified them in the light of experience; at other times, he demanded that they be altered to fit in with his requirements. In keeping with his role, he demolished everything whenever he judged it more practical to begin a new ordet than to renovate the oId. We have often said that the Reform was, above all, conditioned by the needs and circum- stances of war; it is remarkable that, although carried out jn the midst of crises 2nd dangers, and though Peter was always on the move, wielding the sword in one hand and the pen in the other, it does not appear improvised or makeshift in any way. Wc can always see the whole rising above the immediate circumstances, so that each part of the work fits in perfectly with the whoIe, as much in space as in time. This is because, being an Indi~iduality like Alexander, Peter was alwqs iogical and fr~e to birnself. Guided by the Reform he had undertaken, in his own words, pr the common good, so that the people moy be relieved,\" ' he consecrated his whole life to this cause. This expIains the extraordinary fact that his Reform contains no contradiction jn itseIE; that its different parts, realized at dif- ferent periods and in different sectors of the life of the State, and often in haste under the pressure of urgent needs, appear, in the end, like the members of a living and hatmonio.~~ body. It was like this fot thirty- eight years, begjnnjng with the first measures he took at the age of four- teen. How can one come to any other conclusion than that the general plan of the Reform had already been conceived and developed b$re the young Czar began to execute it? This is a logical conclusion, though it may seem absurd, humanly speaking: as with Alexander, the work that Peter accom- plished in Russia appears as the fulfilment oE a mission. F rom the esoteric point ofview, it would be interesting to know what the Emperor himseIf thought about his Reform. UnfortunateIy, he expressed practically no opinion about it. However, when he heard the news that his plenipotentiaries had signed the peace of Nystad, he was filled wjth joy and cried out: 'Thi.~ end^ the educabiott of the R~rsiaftpeople in a school efdhree stages!' He came back to this formuEa several times, even in writing, but only explained it once, during a 'reception', when his aides asked him to enlighten them on this point, He took up a pencil and wrote: 3x7=21 16. Compl~tc coIlcction of the laws of the Russian Empirc. Series I, no. 3840. underlining that the Reform had been carried out in three stages, each lasting seven years: 1. The accumulation of strength (1700-1707). 2, The gxawth of Russia's glory (1707-1714). 3. The establishment of the 'good order' (1714-1721). This brought to light the fact that the Reform was accomplished in three s8pen-yearplufi~, with successive displacements of the centre of gravity. It is impossible to say bow and when these plans were conceived and ela- borated, or where the Czar found his ideas. AII Peter's historians agree that he easily broke with routine in any domain to establish a new order. Bus if one keeps in mind the circumstances in which Peter worked, the intro- duction of such changes seems impossible without the existence of a complete and preestablished plan. Once again, then, we have to recog- nize that, pu~itiu~~, we face an enigma. We will repeat that, in the case of Peter as well as Alexander, we can only find the solution on the esoferic plane. P eter the Great's Reform called forth a great deaI of criticism and many pessimistic forecasts. Many people in Europe affirmed that the Refor- mer's work held only because of his iron will, and that after his death the country would inevitably fall back into its previous state. Events proved the contrary. This appears even mote remarkable when we note that, among the thirteen sovereigns who succeeded the Emperor on the Rus- sian throne, from the time of his death in 1725 until the Revolution of 1917, only his daughter, Elizabeth I, continued his work. Aided by her father's collaborators, she saved the ~eform.'~ Her successors proved to be weak and without understanding: the foreign dynasty that reigncd over Russia during the one hundred and fifty-five years after Elizabeth's death methodically put a brake to the application of the Reformer's precepts and mutilaced his work.\" How then can we understand the success of the Reform? This success was conditioned by the following factots: 1. The beauty of the cause and its appropriateness to the time, both immediate and in the long term; 2. The utility and viability of the enterprises; 3. The well-defined goals and the 'open door' policies which let new talent in: the first serious attempt to establish eqaiip cf opporfunily (Peter nC~cr stopped repeating \"merit before ancestry'); --b -- I?.

We have seen that Voltaire was the first to discover the philosopher in the Emperor. Since then, no one has risked writing on this subject. On the personal, social and political planes, Peter's philosophcal basis was Faith, Hope and KnwIedge, upheld in sinrerig by the boundless he he had for his people, in whom he had an unshakeable faith. Among the Emperor\" papers, a manuscript was found which had prob- ably been prepared for his personal use in his hours of meditation. It was dated 1722, and contained a brief risumi of the DecaIog~e compared with the doctrine of the Gospel. It was conceived as a two-column table: in the left-hand column, the Ten Commandments of Moses appear, one after the other, and on the right hand are brief notes about each, listing the cotrc- spending sins. The foltowing text came next: 'After having enumerated all the sins for each commandment, I find that there is one missing, namely, hypocrisy. Why? Because though only one category of sins corresponds to each commandment, hypocrisy encom- passes them all together.' Then, after having shown that hypocrisy is the basis of each of the ten categories of sins, Peter concludes by showing the importance of hypoc- risy in relation to all the other sins, as well as Its own place. For this, he takes the New Testament as a basis and ends on an original note: 'After all, Christ our Saviour commanded his disciples to fear nothing except hypocrisy when he said: 'Beware of the leaven of the Phari~ets, which j~ bporrisy. ,21&22 This note lays bare Peter's heart, There is no question here of a merely <+ intellectual point of view': never, in all his life, did Peter stoop to hypocrisy. T o close this chapter, we will relate the circumstances in which the Reformer died. It is known that Peter suffered from nephritis; yet, confident in his robust constitution, he neglected his health and, as he grew older, the crises became more and more frequent and painful. On the 10th of October 1724, after cine of the worst attacks he had ever suffered, while Present at the launching ceremony of a new ship, he turned to the Dutch minister and simply said that he felt a little weak. A few days later, against the advice of his doctors, he went to inspect the Ladoga canal, and from % - 21. Luke xii: 1 22. Cabinet, Libre 31; SoIoviov, op, clt., Vnl. XVIII. Ch.

From Olonetz, hc continued his journey to Staraya-Russa to visit the salt-lakes there, and, toward the middle of November, he boarded his yacht and headed towards St Petersburg. On arriving at Lakhta in the Neva estuary, ht saw a lugger from Kron- stadt that had just run aground. The Emperor rushed to its aid, for the sea was rough. He jumped into the water and saved two unconscious men by carrying them to land on his back. Then, waist-high in the icy watet, he worked at setting the ship afloat. This exploit proved fatal for him. He caught a cold and was immediately plunged into another crisis. He returned to St Petersburg, no Ionger having the strength to overcome it. The attack took a particularIy acute turn on the 28th of January, caus- ing him great pain. On February 2nd, the Emperor took communion and received the extreme unction, but he did not stop working until his last breath; he issued four ukases and, as death approached, proclaimed an amnesty for all those (civil or military) who had been sentenced to capital punishment. I n principle, the Russian monarchy was elective, but, 3s in Rome and Byzantiurn, the reigning sovereign sometimes designated his successor. Peter the Great established this custom as a right. However, he died without being able to name a successor. On the afternoon of the 7th of February 1725 AD, when he was already at death's door, he asked for a slate and a piece of chalk, and began to write when, suddenly, the chalk fell from his hand, which had become paralyscd. He then called for his daughter Anne, who was his secretary, to dictate his last wishes, As the princess approached his bedside, the emperor lost his power of speech as weH.

The throne was vacant. The death of this extraordinary man faced Russia with an alternative: to return to the old regime of the boynrs, as the enemies of the Reform wished, or to follow the path traced out by the Reformer for centuries to cornc. For sixteen years, the country marked time under a regime of 'favour- ites'. Nothing short of a palace revolution could remedy the situation, and this was led by Elizabeth, the Reformer's daughter. The new Empress called all her father's faithful followers to power, and during the twenty veais of her reign she resolutely put Russia on the path traced out by Peter ;he Great, me first part of the Reformer's esoteric work was thus saved.

Can it be solved? In theory, yes, for everything necessary to organize a life of paradise on Earth is now available. In practice, however, the under- development of the human Personality may give us serious doubts about the chances of finding a happy solution to this problem. Even when gifted with the faculty of reason, and when, at least in potential, it possesses good f~ith, this underdeveloped Personality too often acts illogically, not only against its own interests, but against common sense. This is why, against the will of peoples and responsible Statesmen, war sometimes breaks out. But our aim, in the present chapter and the next, is not to analyse thc risks of a new world war; we are only trying to ouhne, in the general international situation as it has developed in history and as it now appears, the probable destiny of the geopolitical group, mostly made up of Ortho- dox and MusIim peoples, who today occupy the extended territory af the old HeUenistic world. The cradle of Christianity, and later a€ Islam, this geopolitical ensemble -as we have nIready pointed out - is called on, unless it hih, to be the matrix from which the Era of the Holy Spirit will emerge.

The Emperor's daughter was conscious of this situation and, on the night of the 25th of November 1741, led three hundred grenadiers of her father's Guard, arrested the Regent, who was the Duchess of Braunschweig-Liineburg, and mounted the throne amid popular rejoi- cing. She was the last national Empress in Russian history.2 The Empress put up a fierce resistance against the Germanic Drang nach 01tea: at the same time consolidating the ties between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. The two oriental empires then had almost the entire territory of the old Hellenistic world under their sway. W e must understand that it is not possible to grasp the deeper meaning of great historical movements without placing them in the wider context of esoteric evolution, which occurs in Cycles. Indeed, it is neces- sary to Iearn to encompass vast totalities of time which, because of their amplitude, generally escape the vision of thc human mind. But the under- developed human Personality deifies itself ridiculously and considers that it has reached the summit of all that is possible. From there, it imposes a ban on men who dare to see things beyond the boundaries of Ithe @or- abimrrs. Did not the Apostle St Peter say: ' ... one day is with the Lord ar o fho~~amdyears, and a thourandyears os one dny.j4 So, if we wish to grasp the real meaning of historical evolution - which is always esoterjc, because it is determined by the Lord's will-we must learn to consider it on His scale, and no longer on our own: that is, to hold it in mind in sections whose duration covers severaI doys of the Lord.

Divided into stages, this pro- jection covered sixteen thousand years in all, starting with the fall ofAdam and ending at the last ~ud~ernent.~ Whac interests us particularly is to follow the general evolution of the history of those peoples who live within the perimeter of the Hellenistic world- this world, which after becoming the cradle of Christianity, and then that of Islam, has been chosen to see the first-fruits ofthe Era of the Holy Spirit ripen on her soil. 2.

W ith the little information that science has placed at our disposal, we must try to show, that, from the esoteric point of view, the Wel- lenistic perimeter'really marked the boundaries of a geopolitica1 body. After this, we must outline and try to understand the play of the politicaP and culturaI forces for which this region was the theatre, and sometimes the stakes as well - as jt continues to be. An attentive study, covering a period of about four thousand years up to the present day, will help us discern the limits of a vast area whose peri- meter corresponds wjth what we described eadier. We will continue to caI1 this geopolitical area Wellenistic', because this is convenient on the one hand- though we go back much farther than Alexander the Great -and on another hand because in the intended study this term becomes incieas- ingly appropriate, N ow we find ourselves within the NelIenixtic Perimeter as we have just defined it, which, gram modo, includes the whole of the Orthodox and Muslim worlds so often labelled the 'East'. The line from Stettin to Trieste marks the approximate boundary between what has always been defined as the 'Orient', and the 'Occi- dent'. Extended in the north by the Baltic - the Gulf of Bothnia - up to Totnio, and beyond, up to Muxmansk and on to the North Pole, this is the demarcation line between the zones of Eastern and Western influences in contemporary history. The Duke of Richelieu created a political system known as the Eastern Barrier, which we find again as the 'Cordon Sanitaire' after the First World War, and as the 'Iron Cursainkfter the Second. Louis XV found a cIearer exptession for this, as we lcarn from a memorandum ptcscnted by the Count de Broglie, former director of the monarch's occult ministry, to Louis XVI, Regarding the reversal of the aIliances which took pIace in 1756, after which France entered the Seven Years' War and fought at Russia's side, de Brog'lie noted: '. ..

The chief motive for this political approach lay in a fear of Russia: it was a question of creating a zone of protection that could be used if necessary as a depot for arms and ammunition to launch attacks against that counuy. We know that, since the time of Cardinal Richelieu and King Gustavus-Adolphus, Russia has been invaded four times by the West-that is, regularly every century. The last and most terrible invasion was launched by the armies of the Third Reich, flanked by those of Finland and Rumania; as in Napoleon's cam- paign in 1812, divisions from many other western nations took part, notably from Austria, Spain, France, Hungary, Italy and Slovakia. T owards the South, the Stettin-Trieste line is extended by the waters of the Adriatic, then, on the other side of the Mediterranean, it touches the Arab or Islamic world, which in its expansion towards the west since the Hegira, has reached the Atlantic, although remaining faithful to its Oriental origins in its racial character and its specific culture and beliefs.' T o the west of the European Occident, beyond the Atlantic, the New World that we will call the Far West, which is a world in formation, is characterized by a simultaneous process of integration and diffexentiation that can give birth to new civilizing historical types. T o the east of the classical Orient, the ethnic Chinese world, a very ancient original culture, is surrounded by peoples of different races, pure or mixed, who ate all subject to a marked Chinese influence. This is the world which is the Far East. 7. The Frcnch has hem AdwaISiquc. 8. In this marking of frontiers, we have left contemporary Italy outside the limits or the HeIlenistic Perimeter. One must not however forget rhat since the fifth Century BC, there were many Greek colonies in the Southcrn Peninsula and Sicily, and that this rcgion was known as Grcutrr Grccrc. On anothcr hand, thc North of Italy was strongly influenced by Ryzantium from which the Italian Renaissance was born. Eksldes, it is not superfluous to mention the present movement, which seems strange and even paradoxical at frtst sight, of the spontaneous rcturn to Orthodoxy that one may observe in the rural population of the Pcnmsula; this movement is certainly still insignificant quantitatively, but qualitatively it is significant pce- cisely because of th~s spontaneity. W hereas the East and West are divided by the Stettin-Trieste line, the Far East and the Fax West meet and merge in the waters of the Pacific. Besides AustraIia and New Zealand which, Iike South Africa, were colonies peopled by the Occident, so that they lean toward the West bcause of their ethnic and cultural ties, we still have to locate two more ~ast worlds; that of the black Continent, and that of the Indian Ocean. t is stiIl too earIy to make any predictions concerning the black race 1 which, as we have out, is at the beginning of its renaissance9 and finds itself between concurrent influences: Christian, Islamic, Communist and pan-African. We locate the Indian worId with its northern limits stretching to the Pamir and the Himalayan chain, to the Straits of Bab-el-Mendeb in the West, to the Malay Straits in the East, and to she Indonesian Archipelago which it surrounds in the South. This group, which is well-defined by natural limits in the North, West, and East is separated from the populations of Australia and New Zealand in the South by a frontier of a moral nature - an ethnic and cultural difference. As for its political orientation, although it is a world that lies between the East and the Far East, it seems that its sympathies lean toward the former. The depository of the ancient Aryan culture, and containing two Islamic groups, it seems that its different links with the Arab and Russian worlds will be developed and consolidated with time, especially if modern socia- list ideas develop within the traditional Hindu consciousness of the Aryan Dharma."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAPTER V H umaoity has now reached the great historical crossroads. Here each of the geopolitical groups we have defined must make a choice and I trace out its political and cultural path for the coming centuries. Several factors, some of them common to all the groups and others different, must be regarded as components, whose rt~ht will determine the character of each of these groups as well as its fate for the duration of the Era of the Holy Spitit. Without trying to play the prophet, we can easily foresee that, in its the Black World will take its place between the West and the Far West. Its special influence, which is already very strong in America, is spreading from therc to take root in old Europe where, in spite of some it is constantly gaining ground. Mainly through the rhythms of its music and dance it is penetrating ever further into the vast and almost uncontroIlable domain of human subconsciousness, so that in future it will manifest spectacularly in that sector of Western life that relates to the passions. Regarding the World of the Far East, the palace revolution in Japan in 1868 marked an awakening and movement in the peoples of this region. The Japanese renaissance became really intense after the Chinese revolu- tion of I91 1. Since the Second World War, a unified China has pursued an active poIitical line and is trying to dominate this region, if not to establish its hegemony, Everything leads us to believe that the dynamism with which it follows this direction has not yet reached its peak. Proud of their ancient original culture, and conscious of the great strength that resides in their numbers, the Chinese hardly worry about the rest of the human race, whom they consider-apart from a few excep- tions - as more or less civilized barbarians who cannot hide their infer- iority. AS Russia's neighbour, China borders on the Hel~enisticperime#er, but is of interest to us, along with the other peoples of the Far East, chiefly because of its geopolitical attitude. Today, this group is mainly domi- nated by its demographic situation. As we see it, the Far East now has a Population of wei one billion, with a density that is often more than two hundred inhabitants to the square kilometre. History teaches us that this state of things creates a demographic pres- sure which first shows up on the psychological plane, then in action: unless a large safety valve opens in time, this pressure creates a spirit"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"of expansion which too often degenerates into a spirit of aggression. Conscious of this phenomenon of the psyche, certain Western observers and diplomats think that this pressure will be fatally resolved by an inva- sion, and to be more precise, by an invasion of Russia. From this paint of view, the 'fraternal' quarrels between Chinese and Rusdm Communists confirm the probability of a Chinese expansion toward Siberia. Those who think this way - and who, perhaps, hope that a conflict between China and Russia will neutralize the power of the two communist colossi in an epic struggle - overlook certain historical factors that are nevertheless obvious. This is why the Russians and Chinese, who have n common frontier of thousands of kilometres, have never bothered to fortify it. This frontier remained open throughout Russia's worst trials, which included thc First World War, the Revolution, the Tflteryen- tion and the civil war which folkwed it, and finally, the invasion by the Third Reich. A Chinese attack was unthinkable in the past and, in our opinion, in spite of everything, it will remain so in the future. Other observers seem to think that the Chinese invasion wjlI be directed toward India. Nobody noticed any sign of this in the recent attack, although it was in that locality. We make a big fuss over China's anxiety to establish her prestige, and her desire to eliminate any rival that may prevent her from gaining hegemony over all Asia ... but to what end? We must not forget that the Indian world is a world apart, and does not belong to the world ofthe Far East. Besides, the idea of leaving one overpopulated and undetnourishcd human reservoir to invade another where the samc conditions prevail seems against common sense. T he multi-millennia1 history of China proves that her people do not reaIly suffer from animperialist complex: this is so true that, untiI the last century, the Chinese regarded the military career with disdain. On the contrary, it is China that has been the victim of many aggressions: by the Tartars, the Manchus, the MongoIs and lady the Europeans and the Japanese. The Great Wall that Emperor Tsin-Chi-Hoang-Ti constructed in 247 BC, after having repulsed one of the Mongol invasions, was a magnificent expression of the ardent desire of the Chinese people to live in peace and keep working. However, the Old World seems even more afraid of China than of the progress made by Russia. 'She combination of 'demographic pressure' and Communism, and the fact that China is trying very hard to become a great nuclear power, are all nightmarish subjects for Western observers and Statesmen. They keep trying to guess in which direction the inevitable Chinese expansion wilt take place. The Yellow Peril, evoked by the famous view which Emperor William II of Germany suggested to Czar Nichdas 11 of Russia, still continues to haunt Western minds in different ways ... H istory teaches US that imaginary dangers sometimes provoke teal catastrophes. The present armaments race may find its origin in Such dangers, reinforced by the desire to forestall an eventual Russian jnvasjon of Europe. Yet, we must not forget that Russian armies have rimer appeared in Western Europe except in two situations: either at the quest of European powers, or in pursuit of European armies driven from the Russian plain. A Russian invasion of Europe would be mad -and is therefore unthinkable. However, in the West, and then in the East, this unjustified and purely chimerical feat has already provoked the creation of enormous weapons, all in the hope of preserving peace. This is a rent danger, given the explosive psychological and material elements it brings together. W hile we consider the problem of the internal demographic pressure from which China now suffers, it would not be superfluous to give our idea of the probable form that Chinese expansion could take if it takes dynamic form as armed aggression, as some think it may. To imagine the direction of a massive Chinese military expansion, we must keep in mind the direction of their Pacific expansion, which has been going on for several centuries. The Chinese are clever merchants and financiers, besides being patient and persevering colonizers. Intrepid sai- lors, they have never considered the seas to be an obstacle. On the con- trary, for centuries they have mainly gone toward the Levant: they can now be found everywhere east of Singapore. We must not forget too that the Chinese mentality is dominated by a consciousness of their great numbers. We can see this fact in many Speeches and political writings, and it is chis attitude which causes them to consider an eventual war or nucIear conflict in an entirely different light how Westerners would view it. If, one day, a Chinese Moses, capable of creating a mystique of the Promised Laad, comes to power, it is not improbable to imagine an Onrush of these masses across the islands and archipelagos of the Pacific"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"toward the United States and Canada. There is a great difference between China and the United States. It would be quite conceivable today to paralyse the US by atomic bombardment of its cities; but to stop the onrush of hundreds of millions of Chinese attacking in many different ways, from the most advanced, like the atomic bomb, to the most prirni- tive, like junks, would be a more difficult task. One might annihilate half of them-and the Chinese know how to smile at death!-but this would not prevent the other half from reaching the shores of the Promised Land. What then would be the attitude of the Chinese, the Japanese, and the American Blacks, who, together, now represent fifteen or even twenty per cent of the population of the United States? Nobody knows. And who would raise not his voice but his sword to save the Americans? It is difficult to foresee this. So there seems little doubt that, for the Chinese, the conquest of the United States of America, or of Canada, which are highly prosperous countries, is an infinitely more tempting perspective than an invasion of an undernourished India or of a Russia that, they know, will put up a massive and united resistance, as she did against the armies of the Third Reich and its allies. I t is now necessary to study present and future historical aspects of the relationship between the two Worlds which are at the centre of the probIem: the Orient and the Occident from the esoteric point of view. We have said that to separate out the comtunts in the geopolitical attitude of human groups, it is necessary to go back much farther than the limits of contemporary, modern, or even medieval history. The motives that impel the masses to act often remain in a latent state in the national or racial subconsciousness for centuries or even millennia. The elements of these motives can accumulate there as dim memories of resounding victories, or of aspirations for revenge after defeat or uprisings after oppression or slavery. Though effaced from the immediate memory of peoples, the memory-consciousness of these passionate aspirations remains in the cor- ridors of the subconsciousness, and it makes up part of what we call, in the largest sense of the term, the spirit of fhe~lese peoph. When a leader appears who incarnates this part of the subconscieusness of the masses, he communicates a dynamic character to the latent forces that it contains; and ifthe masses follow him 'bl indIy', it is because each one really answcrs a call from the depths of his own subconsciousness. If the Ieadet incarnates this collective feeling more or less consciously, (Charles XIS, Hitler), or after deep reflection and study (NapoIeon), if hc &eys an inner voice, if he is conscjous ofa mission (Alexander, Peter), or if he is awakened by a shock (Moses), we hd in every case that, behlnd the personality of the here-whether he is a builder or a destroyer-there is a ,,tegorical imperative which he cannot disobey even if he wished. In fact, ejther consciously or unconsciously, they a11 act as bearers of a mandate. This mandate comes from the esoteric plane. Its content and rajson d'itre are generally unseen by the very limited waking consciousness of human beings - even highly developed or cultured Personalities who give the impression of being awake. Napoleon, who considered himself wide awaket -and who was indeed so, in human terms - built his career by firmly believing in his 'stat?.. W hen we study the relationship between the group of Germano- Roman peoples rooted in the West and the Slavo-Hellenistic peo- ples of the East over the largest possible timescale, we can easily discover a comtanf: strongly anchored in the subconsciousness of the Romans, and then of the Germans and Getmano-Romans, this constant first took the form of an instinctive movement which, wery now and again, became active and pushed them toward the conquest of the East. In 147 BC, ancient Hellas ceased to exist on the political plane. It was conquered by the Romans, who reduced it to the status of a province known as Achaea. During the Crusades, when the Eastern Empire already showed signs of weakening, the movement from the West became even more marked: in 1080, Robert Gujscard led the first Norman expedition into Greece and subdued Epirus, as well as a part of Thessaly; in 1246, Roger, King of Sicily, savaged Etolia and Acarnania, penetrated into the Gulf of Corinth, took Corinth and Thebes and captured a horde of Boeotians; lastly, during the 4th crusade (1204) Enrico Dandolo, the octogenarian Doge of Venice, took Constantinople. Though refusing the Imperial crown offeted him by the Crusaders, he proclaimed himself despot of Roumania and obtained, for the republic of St Mark, a ward in New Rome, as well as the Isles of the Archipelago and Candia (the IsIe of Crete). AIthough the reconquest of Constantinople by Michael Palaeolo- gus in 1261, tolled the knell of the Roman Empire, ancient Hellas was finally Ziberated from the Westerners only when the latter were pushed Cf. h.lasquis Louis de Caulaincourt, MCmoiirrr dit Ginrial dc CBY/B~RIOWI, dnc de Victnc~, first 'qucr~ of the Emperor. 1ntduction and notes by Jean Hanotcau, 3 vol., Plon, Paris, 1933, Pmfim *"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"back by the successive Turkish victories. The action of the West against Greece was thus stemmed. W hen the IVth Crusade, preached by Foulque de Neuilly during the pontificate of Innocent 111, triumphed at Constantinople, the Roman Clergy at the instigation of Pope Gregory IX launched a Crusade against Russia. It was led by the Teutonic Knights, Swedes, Norwegians and Danes, under the command of Birger de Bielbo, future regent of Sweden. This crusade was crushed by 22-year-old Prince Alexander of Novgorod on the 15th of July 1240, soon after the Crusaders had landed on the southern bank of the Neva. Attacking the invaders with his cavalry, he managed to reach Birger and wound him in the face with a stroke of his sword, forcing him to retreat. While reembarking, many of the crusaders were killed or thrown into the river. Two years later, the crusade was resumed. The Teutonic Knights and the Sword Bearers, reinforced by German and Livonian Militia, attacked and wok Pskov, then marched on Novgorod crying: 'Humiliation to the Slavs.' Then Alexander Nevsky put himself and his guards at the head of the regiments of Novgorod and matched against the Knights. The deci- sive battle took place on April 5th 1242, and the shock was produced on the ice of Lake Peipous. Alexander inflicted a crushing defeat on the Orders and their militia. The ice on the lake, thinner than in winter, would not support the weight of all the mass of fugitives, whowere swallowed in the depths of the waters. T he Tartar Invasion of Russia began in 1223 with the Battle of Kalka- named after a small river that flows into the sea ofAzov. Corning from conquered Persia, a strong Tartar army suddenly appeared in the Russian steppes and overcame a hastily assembled army of princes. After their victory, however, the Tartars disappeared as suddenly as they had come, and so this battle had no political consequences. Fourteen years later, in 2237, after having devastated the Bulgarian kingdom of Kama, the GoIden Horde commanded by Batu-Khan crossed the icebound Volga and undertook the methodical conquest of Russian principalities over a period of three years. The Tartar invasion was at its peak in the summer of 1240, when Prince Alexander Nevsky was combating Birger's crusade. On the 6th of Decem- her of the same year, Kiev was taken by assault and devastated: this was the beginning of the Mongol yoke, which lasted two and a half centuries. Ljke Greece, Russia was hemmed in by a huge pincer made up of the Tartars coming from the East and Germans coming from the West. With foresight - and despite the horrible sufferings that the ~~ssians endured at the hands of the Tartars - when he became ruler of Russia in 1252, Alexander's political policy was based on his loudly proclaimed principle that the real danger did not come from the Tartar conquerors, bur from the West, from the Romans, as the Russians then called the Occidental peoples who owed obedience to the Pope. The great prince was right: the Tartar conquest of Russia - Iike the Turkish conquest of the Oriental Empire-did not overcome the national and cultural entity of the Russians or the Greeks: in both cases, the con- querors proved themselves incapable of absorbing the vanquished and did not even leave any perceptible traces of their original culture. These invasions brought suffering and the Ioss of a considerable amount of material and men, but nothing more. On the other hand, if it had been successful, the German or Germano-Roman invasion would have pro- found!~ changed the spiritual and psychological identity of the Russians and Greeks. The best proof of this is the fact that the Western steppes of the Slavo-Hellenistic world became Catholic, and were thus westernized for centuries. From the esoteric point of view from which we must study the deeper mezning of the great currents of history whose axis is found within the Hrllenistirperinaeter, the appearance of the Turks in Europe is more sig- nificant. A paradoxical fact which science overlooks, but which is never- theless real, is that their overwhelming attack, which reached right into the heart of Europe, neutralized the Western action against the East and thus saved the Russians and the Greeks from a serious blow to their psyche. At the same time as the Turks, came the sermons of John Hus (1369- 14151, which ignited the religious wars. Powerfully backed against the imperialists by John Zizha (1 37&1424), this preaching heralded the Reformation, which was recognized the following century with the peace of Augsburg (1 5551, from which the West emerged disunited, weakened, and therefore momentarily less dangerous to the East. H owever, the real danger for the Hellenistic perimeter came, as it still comes, from the West. During the Second WorId War, the armies of the Third Reich and its allies penetrated into Russia as far as the Crirnea"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"and the Caucasus, and even reached the Volga. The situation inside the perimeter then became critical: untiI the defeat and surrender of Marshal von Paulus and his army, the risk of slavery was very real for the people concerned. It was only in 1943, after the Battle of Stdingrad decided the fate of this epic struggle between Germans and Slavs, that one could be sure that the SIavo-Hellenistic world and its centre, Greece, were saved.\" The reader should understand that the attack on Russia in 1941 by the Third Reich was not merely an \"accident of lustory' due to the 'hypnotic hold' that Hider had over the German people. We must not forget that the Fuhrer became ChancelIor of the Reich by constitutional means, and that he was invested with power by Maxshal von Hindenburg, President of 1 Reich. This attack was sinply the expression of a strong subconscic tendency that had been nurtured for more than fifteen centuries. T desire to 'hurniIiate the Slavs' had been proclaimed more than once in history, notsbly in the famous formula of Drang nuch Osten: an instinc- tive, subconscious call acting against all reason. Suffering from an immense superiority complex, the Germans consid- ered themselves a master race who were called upon to dominate the others by force. Obeying this 'mystic' call, they often engaged in wars of con- quest, sometimes against all common sense, The two World Wars are examples of this. But we insist that in fact these aggressions were not the personal acts of WilIiam I1 or of Hitler. We can detect the same spirit and motives in the Germans as far back as the beginning of our era. Here, it would be useful to recall the testimony of Josephus Flavius: 'When Vespasian was still in Alexandria, and Titus was still busy with the siege of Jerusalem, many Germans revolted: their neighbours, the Gauls, Eollowed suit. Both peoples nursed the hope of togetheroverthrow- ing the Roman yoke. In their emancipation, the Germans were guided, above all, by their national character, on the strength of which they thoughtlessly and blindly hurl themselves into danger with only the mini- mum chance of suc~css.'~ When we deal with the subject of the Hei/dni~die Perimeter, and through it, of the Time of Tr~nsifio~, in considering the boundaries of this region whish is called on to become the cradle of the Era of the Holy Spirit, we must not neglect the danger already hinted at. Instead, we must keep in mind that this danger will always exist, however great the sinceriry and cultural Ievel of Germany's leaders. Instincts of this kind slumber in a subc~:onsciousness whose imperatives too often win over reason, even in hjghIy civilized people. 2.

Peter the Great's prophecy is now being fulfilled before our eyes: on the 25th October, 1962, on the Isle of Kos, Hippocrates' native land, King Constantine 11, then Crown prince, laid the foundation stone of the Inttr- nntionnlHippocratic Hause or Palace of Medicine, where medical Olympiads will take place, and where the Hippocraticpriqe for medical research wiII be a~arded.~ Tmpestant in the history of human culture, this event gives us an oppor- tunity to grasp the deeper meaning of History, which is profoundly logical if we try to view it on the scale of the Lord, Master of evolution, for Whom one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years are as one day. This perspective can be grasped by the minds of superior beings like Alexander, Peter, and by others as well. 4% International Hippocratic Foundntion ofKos, ratified by Royal Decm No. 431,29th at~hr 1960."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"rebellious province of the Roman Empite, but whose inffuence has rcachcd the farthest corners of the world.

The most authoritative source in this matter is, without a doubt, josephus Flavjus, who, as he mentions in his autobiography, him- self became a Pharisee. He gives us quite a derailed description of the three Jewish schools of philosophy. The first two were the Pharisees and Sad- ducees, and the third - which visibly pursued a very particular virtue - were the ~ssenes.' According to Flavius, the Sadducees belonged to a sect that was formed in the third century BC. Numbered among them were military leaders, especially thc commanders of forts, town and State notables, and the landed aristocracy. They taught that the Mosaic Law was of divine origin and that nobody had power to alter it. They believed that God was the foundation of the Universe but that the human soul perished with the body. Lastly, they said that God did not interfere in human affairs, st that men wcre free to fashion their own destiny, They denied the existent! 4. Marthcw xiii: 33. 5. Ibid. xvi: 6; Mark viii: 15. 6.

They were also in favour of a compromise between the Mosaic Law and Greek The Pharisees, on the other hand, were sworn enemies of Greek phi- tosophy and culture. Adapting the prescriptions of the Tarah to suit the demands of the period, they taught that the Pentateuch contained all of philosophy, law, science and even art, and that it was the source of all wisdom. Based on this conception, they elaborated a series of rules and directives (Galah) to which the life of every Jew was supposed to be rigorously subjected. Jesus pointed out the strong tendency toward pro- selytism there, as well as an anxiety for preserving the Jewish people from non- Judaic conceptions and culture.

'I0 T his brief account from Flavius, which gives us an idea of the two major currents of Jewish thought which flourished at the time of Christ's ministry, also shows us several points in common between them and what we can observe in the cuItured Iayers of our contemporary civilization. Today, like the Sadducees, we willingly profess a sort of VoItairian deism which does not commit us to anything. Instead, it enables us to enjoy the wealth and pleasures of this world without taking responsibility for our actions, other than those punishable by human law. This attitude of the Sadducees, ancient and modern, fits in very we11 with what the GeneraLhw tolerates, as well as with the demands of the Absolute 111.

Although they are passive on the esoteric pIane, the Sadducees are ve active on the material plane. This is as true of the 'white' Sadducees as f their 'red' counterparts. Further on, we will come back to this didnait when we define the characteristic traits of each in relation to the dcsird esoteric evolution a€ human society during the Time of Tsan~itiotr. I t is more difficult to speak of the Pharisees of our civilization and of o time. Ever since the Renaissance, the Reformation, and then the 171 Revolution, followed by the triple industrial revolution, the 'Saddnce philosophy - often incorrectly called 'Cartesian' - has won acceptanc . This contemporary Sadducean creed has become a kind of sacred tradition. Mistaken for bourgeois liberalism, and based on the tacit deification of the human Personality in its incomplete condition, it has become the code of the free world. This is why the analogy we made cannot and does not shock any body. The question of the Pharisees is quite different. Let us firse note what Josephus Flavius states about: the relative positions of the Sadducees ar - Pharisees in Jewish society. About the former, he says thnt their doctxir 'had few adherents, though they belonged to high society. Their influem over the masses was insignificant. When they were in pubIic ofice they were forced to side with the Phatisees, otherwise the people would not accept thern.'12 T he term 'Pharisee' has developed such an odious connotation that it is difficuIt to make comparisons as we have with the Sadducees. ~hough they were somewhat degenerate by the advent of Christ, the Pharisees were eriginaIIy considered as the bearers, defenders and author- ized commentators of the Mosaic Law and tradition. They were supposed so be incorruptible, and austere in their habits. Searching for an analogy in the Hellenic world, Flavius compared them with the Stoics. At one time the Roman Catholic Church also adopted this stand. In both cases, we can note analogous factors favouring the prestige of the Pharisees. The latter, however, being part of an orderly and over-disciplined orga- nization, attributed the strength of dogma to their traditions, and so, being prisoners of their intransigence, they proved incapable of an inner evolu- tion. This is why, in time, they became a major political party. They subordinated their originally purely philosophical and religious doctrine to the requirements of their struggle. Gradually, this doctrine became the instrument that enabled them to take control of public affairs and the consciousness of the masses. This mixture of spiritual and temporal affairs, which was normal during the Cycle of the Father when religious law governed civil life, became a dangerous anachronism with the approach of the Cycle of the Son ... Now that the Roman Catholic Church is revising its historical position on spitituaI and temporal matters, it is hardly timely to start another controversy. It is anyway true that, throughout past centuries, nothing positive has ever emerged from polemics of this kind. However, as our studies are a search for Truth, we cannot entirely overlook this question. We only wish with all our heart-and this for the sake ofthe Transition --that the Roman Catholic Church, conscious of its great mission, will find the courage at this irrevocable hour, when preparation must be made for the future, to abandon the temporal to the temporal powers and concen- trate all its efforts on the spiritual. This task is great, and is bound by an eschatological responsibility. Said in other words, this is to leave to Czsar what is Cxsat's and to be dedicated to the things of God; we are not afraid of repeating thnt 'the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.'"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"W e can also find Sadducees and Pharisees on the 'red' dde. As on the 'whitehide, the Sadducees form the technocracy. In this domain, they accomplish remarkable feats which, according to Peter the Great's prophetic speech, 'put to shame\" the most civilized nations.'14 Yet many of these Sadducees would be surprised to learn that the work they accomplish in their domain meets the urgent needs of the Time of Transition that will lead human society into the Eta of the Holy Spirit. Everyone generally agrees that a new Era is approaching, but whether this era will be that of the Holy Spirit is another question. However, these two ideas are drawing closer every day, and in the future they will naturally come together. Though there ate same common points between the 'red' Sadducees and the 'white' Sadducees, a fundamental difference separates them. In the blaze of technical progress, the latter are visibly obsessed by speed. Dominated by the past, they are more and more prisoners of a conserva- tive spirit and a defensive mentality, whereas the dynamism of the 'red' Sadducees never stops growing. The difference in ideologies is at the root of this. Westetn technocracy is based only on infere~t, and generally on privare interest, whereas the \"red' technocracy forges ahead, driven by faith and self-denial in favour of the masses. Contrary to what happens in the West, the 'red' Sadducees in this field present a common front with their Pharisees, and even with their ~ssenes,'~ for faith, in many varieties, lights the hearts of the masses who are divided into these three categories of philosophical or religious faith, with only minor differences between them. It is undeniable that the hearts of the red Pharisees burn with faith, otherwise, they would never have been able to make their revolution yield results that seemed unthinkable even yesterday. It is this faith that makes their strength in the midst of a decadent civilization and a blasi sodety. Nevertheless, they are not immune to a common error similar to that committed by the Roman Catholic Church throughout the course of history ,.. to mix the temporal with the spiritual beyond measure. This error, in their case, would be to crystallize into dogmatism. 13. The French word hcrc is 'm~gi?. a possible play on words. (Ed.) 14. CI. La Mo~ambie rMR, op. cit., pp. 21-2. 15. That is to say, klievtrs, principally Orthdox and Muslims. Flnvius regarded the historical Esscnts as Jewish Pythagorcans. (AstiqrrilEr, op. cit.. XVIII, 1, 4.) A t the beginning of the second volume of this work we mentioned that divine Revelation is not static, and that it is an error to take antiquity as an infallible sign of Truth, as certain seekers do in the esoteric domain. In this domain, the IE is not incurable, as the example of St Paul bears witness: he used to call himself the 'Pharisee of ~harisees'.\" When we progress on the cosmic scale of consciousness, we automatically leave behind all that is outdated or crystallized. Did not St Paul say: 'When I was a rhild, I spke of a chiid, I mdersfood ar a chiid, I tho6cght as a child: b~t when I become a man, Iput awg rbildi~b fhings..'17 It is quite different in the case of a dogmatic materialist: although esoteric evolution is a gradual progress of human consciousness toward the very source of Life, materialistic evolu- rjon does not go beyond the evolution of means. Thus the possibilities that technical progress now offers us have changed the data concerning the problem that Karl Marx posed a cenmrg ago. The world of today has very little in common with that of his day, or even with the world as Lenin knew it. As positive science progressed, the materialism of that day lost its substance. Since then, we have discovered that matter is only one aspect of energy, while the notion of energy itself evolves toward higher and higher planes-an evolution that brings it near to the origin of all power. It is time to abandon this materialistic dogmatism, which is too rigid and so becomes more and more reactionary. It has been outdated by the rapid evolution of positive science-the very science in whose name the Marxist dogma was created. This demands courage and conscious efforts, for the obsession with the past always weighs on the weak human mentality and sometimes provokes gigantic errors just when people think they are fol- lowing the right path. Marxists should understand - and all modern science bears witness to the fact-that coarseness is always an eflecf, while refinement is a caw, In its Iaboratories, contemporary science boks as though it will very soon attain the summit of the scale of finer and finex elements, and one can now believe that it will soon reach the point where it will cross the path of esoteric spiritual research. We sincerely hope that the 'red' Pharisees will abandon their old attitude that is outdated today and has become truIy reactionary. In one OF our recent historical works, we asked the following question, putting it as a conclusion: 'Russian man is not made to live with a cold heart.

Let us imagine for a moment that we havc solved these problems: what then will the Russian heart burn for, since, as we have said, it cannot live without burning? 'Here again in its history, Russia shows its Sphinx-like face.'I8 CHAPTER VII ~ T HE WAY is the theme of this first part of the third volume of Gnosis'. As we have seen, it is an attempt at the practical application of the Gnosis described in the first two volumes of this work. The time has now come to formulate certain considerations that wi11 help to place things in the whole frame of the problems whose solution is a necessary condition for a happy outcome to the Tim of Tranrifion. Before starting our synthesis, let us study certain points which, although they may appear isolated, are, in fact, organically linked to this whole and exercise a direct influence over it. To be precise: in the esoteric domain the time for private research and for the pursuit of individual salvation has come to an end. Imperceptibly, esotericism has become a public affair, and from now on it is only by keeping this new fact in mind that we can conceive and conduct practical esoteric studies. The author is quite aware that what he is advancing may appear surpris- ing and perhaps even disagreeable to certain readers, but thcsc are the facts. H ere, we are not talking about some practical application of Gno~i~ in a direction chosen by the seeker and aimed at a definite result. Natu- rally, a detailed and attentive study of the Doctrine revealed in Gnosis' will enable the student to learn and understand many things about himself, as well as about others and about the Universe in which he lives. It will also enable him gradually to discover a hidden meaning in the Holy Scriptures, one that is generaIIy beyond the teach of those who approach these texts solely with their underdeveloped Personalities, even when their intellec- tual faculties are great and refined. Yet, whether or not we are conscious of the fact, all times - and ours especiaily - give rise to specific unprece- dented problems for human society. We can easily understand this, since historical evolution is a perpetual mwement toward the n~, and therefore toward the mkaown. Every era js accompanied by an appropriate ambience, which can pro- vide a satisfactory solution to the problems it causes. But man is also allowed freedom of choice and, in each case, chooses according to the level of his understanding, and thus of his level of being. And, as we may constate, the ambience that reigns at the end of an epoch opens"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"up new possibilities for man on all planes, while it eliminates those that belong to the preceding era. This is a fact that we may constate quite often in external life, yet it generally escapes our notice in the inner lifc, especially on the esoteric plane. The reason for this is that, in the domain that interests us, the forms of the new direction are always connected with man's inner life, which does not have the spectacular quality of life on the exterior plane. Besides, these forms do not impose themseIves on the individuaI's attention as the forms of civiIization do. Although there is something new in their orienta- tion, they remain subtle, intimate, and almost imperceptible. This means that new data for the human problem are already available: it is up to man to grasp them, to appreciate their significance, and to get down to work with application. Hc must also understand that he cannot do this usefully except by working on the esoteric plane, and by channelling his eEorts in the new direction that has been revealed. It is the same in this domain as in technology: for example, it is obvious that, when we have created ultra-rapid means aEcommunication we do not think of instaIling relays for post-horses along the roads. I f, in the technical domain, the facts direct man toward more and more daring research and expetiments, signposts also exist in the esoteric domain, even though by their natutc they are less visible. In particular there ate two points we wouId like to caIl to the reader's attention. First, experience shows that if, as in days gone by, the seeker undertakes esoteric studies with the Intention of choosing his own aims or gaining his own individual salvation, a cutious phenomenon takes place: he does not make much progress. - - We may ask, is not this goal praiseworthy, and is not our salvation consistent with Divine Will? Certainly, but the conditions are no longer those that applied in the past, as these do not correspond to the esoteric needs of the present. Natutally, this does not alter the fact that, from the time of the great Doctors of the oecurnenjcal Church right down through the centuries, the light of holiness has been attained-except for a few rare exceptions - by seekers who, in deserts or cells, practised individual exercises of concentration and contemplation with the will to reach the light of Christ by means of ecstasy. The technique of esoteric work is the same today as it was in the past. But the conditions in which it will be applied, as well as the orientation of the efforts, have changed. Someone who undertakes esoteric work without keeping these changes in mind mwes in a circle with the imptcssion of to move forward. Secondly, it is always in periods of history when one can observe an effervescence- as In our era - that seekers are offered real pos- sibilities of advancing on the straight path not only in words, but in ,ctEons, and without any risk of falling back into the Wilderness. This is because workers capable of esoteric evolution are sought at such times, while they are not so much needed when the world is in a 'dead calm,' esoterically speaking, under the rule of the Absolute 111. In the same way a doctor would be little use in a society of people in a robust state of health. The law is precise: deprived of a point ofapplication, every force, motal or physical, is condemned to disintegrate. T oday, the demand for esoterically formed workers is great in all branches of human activity, on the scientific plane as well as the moral. Each in their own way, positive science and esoteric science are reaching the point in their respective developments where they must join together. As with a demand for workers in external life, those who aspire to spiritual progress will be given the means for ths training. The seeker is told precisely the goal, and the reward that will be his if he succeeds. For it is written: 'The /nbourer is wort& ofhis hire.\" L et us now try to learn the place that Eastern Orthodoxy occupies within the framework of our study of THE WAY. This is very necessary, especially as its meaning and mission are generally little known in the West, although it has always played a primary role within the Helienistic Perimeter. First, let us consider some characteristics of the organization of the Eastern Church. Where the Roman Church is based on the principle of ecclesiastical unity, and subjected to an aristocratic and monarchic regime under the supreme authority of the Sovereign Pontiff, the Orthodox Church is based on the democratic principle of union. It Is a SederaI union ~f autocephalous Churches, that is to say, each is administratively"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"autonomous, and as fat as possible they reflect the autocephalous early Churches. Normally, all the autocephalous Churches are national, in the sense that the jurisdiction of each covers every diocese within the boundaries of the State in which it exercises ecclesiastical authority. This makes for a better relationship between Church and State. Thus, the creation of new auto- cephalons Churches is aIways possible. This happened with the reconsti- tution of the Polish State after the First World War. Besides the territorial factor, another characteristic of these autocephalous Churches is the lin- guistic factor. Unlike the Roman Catholic Church, there is no special liturgical language in Orthodoxy. Instead of Latin, they hold services in the languages in common use. The territorial factor, however, ranks before the linguistic factor: this is how three autocephalous Otthodox Churches, those of Constantinople, Greece and Cyprus, can all use the same language. T he autocephaIous Churches recognize each other as such. Yet from the canonical point of view, Orthodoxy is one and indivisible. This unity is ensured by a major ptincipIe in the Orthodox Church, which, unlike its Roman counterpart, does not allow dogmatic evolution. On this point it remains consistent to the decisions of the seven early QcMme- nical Councils. It does not recognize the thirteen others that were sum- moned by Rome. The profound meaning of this stand is contained jn the principle, tacitly admitted throughout Orthodoxy, that prayer, and spiritual work in gen- eral, including efforts aimed at Redemption, axe more important than disciplinary questions, In practice this excludes the very need for dog- matic innovation. What explains this is a very important fact that often goes unobserved, namely, that for the Orthodox, as fox the Muslim, prayer is essentially a need, not a d~ty. T his explains the past and present history of the Eastern Church. Contrary to what happens in the West, the Orthodox Church does not interfere in outward life. During the reign of Constantine the Great it was a victim of State abuses, but it accepted them as tests, and refused to lower itself by struggling against the temporal on the temporal plane. Strictly hoIding to the spiritual plane, it always triumphed ever persecu- tions and the severest attacks, without ever losing its purity. This attitude was possible because, on principle, the Orthodox Church has very few links with the temporal life of human society. In this way it a real contrast to the Roman Church. In the first place, it is poor. It has no financial backing, does not control any press, does not concern itself with formal teaching, nor organize arthodox' colleges and universities. One cannot find any 'Orthodox' political parties or professional syndi- cates. It is only rarely that Orthodox prelates assume public office, and they have never accepted any miIitary posts. Neither individually not jointly do the autocephalous Churches maintain diplomatic representatives in for- eign States, nor have they ever maintained reIigious orders of chivaIry such as the Knights Ternplat, the Teutonic Knights, or the Sword-bearers. The Orthodox Church has never given birth to monastic orders like those found in the Catholic Church: Benedictines, Jesuits, Dominicans, Fran- dscans and others. Every Orthodox monastery is directed by a bepmefi (superior) who himself belongs to the autocephalous Church in whose jurisdiction the comrnuniry is located, and the same principle applies to the faithful; an Orthodox memkr automatically falls under the jurisdiction of the autocephalous Church within whose territory he finds himself. This is how the spiritual mion of administratively autocephalous churches2 is expressed. In the second place, the Orthodox Church never knew the Inquisition, begun by St Dominic, which set funera! pyres alight in Europe for six centuries, and caused 'crusades' of Christians against Christians. Neither has it known the Catholic theory of Merit, by which Ind~&e~ct$ were sold or granted. I t is important for the reader of this work to have an idea, however brief, of the meaning and mission of Eastern Orthodoxy, since this represents the heart of the Hellenistic Perimeter, the area in which the struggle has already begun and in which it is hoped that the Era of the Holy Spirit will first triumph. 2. There am* few cxccptions which, however, do not mcmch upon this principle. In this way.

Far ftom it. As an histor- ian, he shares the opinion of those who maintain that if, after the fall of the Roman Empire, Western Europe had been left to itself, without the guidance of the Catholic Church, the difficulties it would have had to surmount to get out of the chaos and permanent state of war caused by rivaI fealties would have been much worse: we only need to think of the wars of religion to be convinced of this fact ... The Orthodox Church is against proselytism. It does not send missions anywhere, except when asked to do so. This attitude may be approved or not, but it is a historical fact. The West has the merit of having spxead Christ's word to corners of the world that were unknown at the time the Apostles lived. The East has the merit of having preserved the Gnosi~ revealed by our Lord. DivuIged now in systematic form, it enables us to have an idea of the efforts made by sincere seekers during centuries and millennia in their quest for the Truth. Thjs is what we are about to study. I n order of succession, the Gnoris that Jesus revealed to John, James and Peter after His resurrection reached Clement of Alexandria (about 16& 215) and his direct disciples. Due to the persecutions of the third century, and the troubles that arose in the heart of Christianity after it became the State religion, it became imperative to make it 'hermetic' if it were to survive. Hidden like a treasure buried in the earth, it silently made its way and, like a subterranean stream, flowed from master to disciple and from generation to generation until the present, when it rose to the surface again. Stripped of its occult character, it reappears with its origjnaI significance as an csoteric projection into the future taking the form of a Nw Couetmnr, or, in other words, a Third Test~menf. The Law of the Old Testament, dictated to Moses on Mount Sinai an thunder and lightning, took the form of a command. OR the other haf the New Testament was not imposed on human beings, it came to them as Good Nem, and each was free to welcome or reject it. Though of great significance, this difference goes unnoticed. We wiII try to understand this different attitude of the divine WiII in the two cases. Thjs wiIl enable us penetrate more deeply the true meaning of the Third Te~tutaent, as well as message. (2) C onsidered from the angle that interests us, the Decalog#e chat was dictated to Moses appears as the insttument which was to cause a first selection, to distinguish the tares from the good seed among the people. who were a mixture. This first Decalogue commanded man to restrain his bestial instincts, those which we indulgently describe today as 'only human\" The Deca- logue implies that man, an animal by nature, is quick to kill, to steal, to commit adultery, to bear false witness, to covet his neighbous's wife and pods, so that he does not do the Will of God but of the idols to which he abandons himself. This postulate throws light on the negative nature of the commandments, which we could not otherwise explain. In fact, one does not say: 'Honow fhJy father and fAy mother,' to someone who respects his parents, but to someone who, in word or in thought, treats them ill. This attitude is quite widespread. If it is demanded that the seventh day be consecrated to God, this is because, without this obligation, God would be rapidly reIegated to the background of the subconscious by outer and inner anxieties as a result of the circumstances in which human beings live ... From this point of view, the Decalogue appears as a touchstone. The hstory of the Jewish people under Moses' leadership gives us a picture of man's rebellion against the Divine Will! The first Decalogue, the text given in the twentieshth chapter of the Book of Exod~s, met with fierce resistance from the ranks of the peo- ple. The account that appears in the thirty-second chapter, verse 19, informs us that, when he was faced with the persjsteat jdolatry of the peopIe, Moses was seized wish rage, broke the tablets on which the Com- mandments were written, and threw them down the mountainside. Then, in Chapter 34 (verse 1) of the same book, we read that Jehwab commanded him to carve two new tablets like the old ones, and told him: 'I will writ8 upon the~e tablets tbe words that were in thefr~t tablet5 which tbo~ brakest. ' But the 1 contents of this Second Decdogue are not at all the same as those of the First: while the first, which is used in the catechism of the Christian Churches, is a moral code of eternal value, the second repeats none of the standards that appear in it."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Fir~f Decalogue 1.

We know that the texts of the two Dcdogucs are not absotutely uniform in all the di&rcnt languages, nor even in the samc Isnguagc. In the present casc, this is ofno impnance. We have presented thc two Decalogues togezhcr 30 that the rcadcr may realize the basic diffcrencc between the two versions. The texrs here nre from the Rcristd Vtriio~ pj the Engiisb Biblt (AD 161 1); British and Foreign Bible Society, 146 Quecn Victoria Street, London. To underline the fundamental difference between them, we have pre- sented these two versions side by side. If we find a moral Code in the first, the second contains a ritual Code, not one that deals with man's relation- ship with his fellow men. As such, it was naturally not included in the catechism of the Christian Churches. M oses' anger, which drove him to break the tablets on which the first Ten Commandments were written, betrays the disappointment he experienced on seeing that the mass of his people were incapable of begin- ning she work of 'debestiali~ation'.~ The latter was the preliminary but necessary condition for the esoteric evolution of the chosen people accord- ing to the timetable established by God. His anger was in fact due to the realization that he had overestimated the moral stature of his people, and that they were not going to stand up to this test. After this failure, they no longer formed a single unit, and their common psyche was divided into two unequal parts. A minority were capable of following the prescriptions of the First Decalogue, but the majority were obedient to the purely ritual Second. Already a minority in Moses' time, the first part dwindled during the years thar followed. By the time of John the Baptist's and Christ's min- istries, they formed only a numerically feeble group. Over the centuries, after a dramatic history of dissensions and calamities, the chosen people had become a mere shadow of itself. It was politically and religiously divided between Tsrael and Judah, between Samaria and Jerusalem, and even within Judaea it was divided by the same struggles, In spite of the broken Tablets, for every Caftch~men who aspires to cross the First Threshold and to progress on the Staircase as one of the Faitbf~f, animated by the will to reach Love and, with it, the second Birth, the First Decalogue still remains a Code of obligatory esoteric standards. T he traditional duaIism made tangible by the two Decalogues was maintained throughout the history of the chosen people, during which the two branches crossed and crossed again so that sometimes 5. modern pamllel cxists in thc disappointment of philosopher P.

(Ed.)"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"one and sometimes the other exercised a dominant influence on the ideas and acts which, at cach turning-point, determined the fate of Israel. In current language, we can say that the Second Decalogue represents human law, while the first, which is esoterically meaningful, is an expres- sion of the divine Will exhorting man to master the demands of the instincts in his impulsive nature. We may easily recognize that this inspiration comes from the Absolute XI, whereas the Second Decalogue interprets the will of the Absolute 111. The current of 'B~influences from the Absolute 11 was received by Moses, who transmitted them to his people. It was this that made Israel different from the other nations, who lived immersed in 'A influences under the religious domination of tribal gods. Having thus become the chosen people, depositories of the higher revelation, they received the Promise of the Advent of the Christ-Redeemer, of their own Redemption and that of the other nations through their ministry. Now the Jewish conception of Jehovah was originally the tribal god of Judah, but was later recognized by the other tribes, although with reservations. It was thus elevated to the rank of God of Israel, yet in the religious imagination of the Jews it was never raised above the attributes of the Absolute 111, even when, much later, the monotheist conception of the one God came to light. This was a question of a relatiua motpotheism, pIacing at the height of the celestial pyramid a sort of Demiurge, ('craftsman' in Greek), Jehovah, who was precisely established in the consciousness of the Jewish people as the God of I.rr4eI. This deviation is important. It even penettated into Christianity. En the catechisms we find that Jehavah, (the God of Israel or the image of the Absolute 111), is confused with Gad the Father, the Creator of the Uni- verse. We have already had occasion to call the reader's attention to the fact that Jesus never identified God the Father, the Heavenly Father, with the God of ~stael,~ of whom he never spoke. 6. The nuthots of the mnonical Old Testament easily attributed the adjective Eternal to the God of Israel. Throughout thc text, one may find this mentioned two hundred times. Now, the readers OF 'Gnos~s' know that ctcmity is only a cycIe of time, and therefore, l~mittd. Tn this scnsc, thc Absolute 111, whowas the first creatureand whosc charactcristicis thcnumbcr FOUR, is really eternal. If thc adjective Eremiwas applied to Jehovah in the tsotcric sense, one would have to admit his identi6carion with the Absolute 111. Wc wilI notice that thc idca of the ctemal in a substantive form ncver appcars in rhc canonical books of the New Testament; it only figures in the form OF an adjective, qualifying facts and conditions, but never God - the I Ioly Trinity being, in essence, rbwc eternity. S ince it emanated from the Absolute TI, the first Mosaic Decalogue was of Christian inspiration and, in spite of everything, it was never corn- pletely eclipsed in the consciousness of the chosen people by the Second ~ecalogue. The Second was of pagan inspiration, in the sense that it emanated from the Absolute TIT. Tn the consciousness of the spiritual elite of the Jewish people, the monotheism relative to Jehovah never managed to replace the fwe monotheism of the consubstantial and indivj- Holy Trinity that was openly proclaimed in historical Christian history. This esoteric tradition was revealed from the time of Moses through the line of the prophets, and found its highest possible expression in the Old Testament period in the person of the prophet-king David. It is true that, as a man, King David was not unblemished-the Bathsheba-Uriah affair is a flagrant proof of this-but the nobility of his sou1 and the greatness of his work brought him not only absolution but the sublime promise that the Messiah would be born of his line.? Psalm CXVIII, which summarizes the esoteric doctrine, designates him as a prophet, and the creation of the unified State of Israel crowns his work as a king. As long as Solomon continued his father's work, Israel, which was n political and economic power, was also a worthy focus for the Promise. But in spite of the revelations he was given at the start, and in spite of his bumnn wisdom, King Solomon did not manage to prevent himself from falIing '. . . attd women corrupted tbe heort of Ki#g Solomofl. . . and Soloman wefit after A~htorefh, the godden of the Zidonians, and afler Mifcon~, the abontinafion of the ~mmonites.\" In these sad and memorable words the chronicler sum- marized the moral catastrophe of the King's life, a catastrophe that, through a chain reaction, provoked the one that was to sweep down upon Israel. Abandoned to Its fate, torn asunder by Fratricidal struggles, a prey to invaders, Israel was never again a politica1 power. This drama of a famous King's abandonment of the spiritual for the temporal has marked Israel's history up to our day, and we are not at all sure that it has ended. It is necessary to understand that this is not, as some think, the result of a revolt ofthe forces under heaven. This conception is contrary to the facts. '. Wc know that the gencalogics of Jesus giwn by Matthew and Cuke do not coincide com- plctcly. They arc, howcvtlr, identical in the branch that goes from Abraham to David inclusive. *ftcr this poinr, they bifurcate. According to Matthew, Joseph was born of David's line through Solomon, and according to Luke, through Nathan, another of the king's sons.

Only unconditional fidelity to the revelation from Christ could have cnsuted the accornpIishment of the esoteric mission of the chosen people, and its preservation from the calamities that were bound to fall upon them like a terrible boomerang, and which did indeed strike them. So it was not an imaginary struggle under heaven which determined the fate of the Jewish people, but the attitude of the latter to this traditional dualism, which pursued them right down the centuries from the time of Solomon, and which still fallows them, requiring of them a conscious and free choi The successive misfortunes that they have experienced are due to i weakness of their heart, which compels them to succumb to the temp tions of the General Law.

This was natural, since the spirit of sacred vengeance is a characteristic of peoples organized in tribes. In this psychological climate, the memory of the greatness of the State under David and Solomon exercised a doul hypnotic influence: it anaesthetized the people on the esoteric plane, a gave rise to the unjustified hope of a magnificent revenge on the politil plane. Of course, it is natural for men who have been enslaved, plunder and buffeted by the blows of fate to project into the future the splendo~ of the past. Sometimes this is even necessary far their recovery, as histc shows. We can easily understand that at the time, in the midst of misfortunes, its common psyche torn asunder, Israel imperceptibly tmr formed the image of the Messiah who was to introduce the new spiritt Era, making him into its future king- blessed, even anointed, endow supetnatural strength, and able to defeat his enemies, (of whom the Romans were the latest), and so ensure a final triumph in the resplendent glory of the new Jerusalem - no longer descended from Heaven, but of this earth. Tn time, these ideas became deepIy rooted in the overexcited imagination of the people, which was the result of this chain of uninterrupted cala- mities, so that after the conquest of Palestine by Pompey in 63 BC, the eschatological aspirations of the Jews were led to a double failure a century later. This was a failure of the attempt by the Jewish rulers ta force the Messiah to play a political and military tole, and a failure of Jesus' mission, which was to accompIish the transition from the Cycle of the Father to the Cycle of the Son in joyous unanimity. The taking of the Temple and the entry of the Romans into the Holy of Holies produced an extraordinary impression on the Jewish people, who considered this an unpardonable offence against God. It is therefore understandable that, in that state of stupor, they implored God to send them a Messiah who would be an Avenger-King in his Ileavenly might. An extract from one of the Psalm of Solomon, written at that time, shows that the spirit of this people was obsessed by the idea of a just vengeance: Look, Lord, and raise them their King, son of David, at the time that thou knowesr, thou, 0 God, so that he reign over Israel, thy servant. And Gird him with thy strength, so that he map destroy the unjust rulers; Purge JerusaIem of the pagans that oppress her, by ruining them so that the sinners against ithe heritage mag be drivcn away by wisdom, by justice, so that the pride of the sinners may be broken like the potter's vases, so that all their substance may be broken with n rod of iron; So that the unholy pagans may bc destroyed by a word of his mouth, so that, before his threat, the pagans may flee far from his face, finally, so that sinners may be recovered by the utterance of their hearts, Then he will assemble the holy people whom he will lcad with justicc, he will govern the tribes of the people sanctified by the Lord his God; He will not let iniquity tarry in their midst, and no man knowing evil wiIl Iive with thcm; For he will know them as being all children of God; he will spread them in their tribes all over the land; nc immigrant and the strangcr will no longer dwell with them.

Transtaztd fmm the Russian. The 'Throe' is an allusion to the Second Triumvirate that then ruled Rome. ing Solomon's fall consolidated the traditional dualism that, until then, had been intermittent, clearly giving it the meaning and formof an esoteric split. David's Christin~ tradition, neglected, deformed and largely forgotten by the ruling elite of the chosen people, who were pre- occupied with political problems, was received and kept chiefly by the simple people - rarely by intellectuals - and continued to make its way silently through the centuries. After the split, the psychic and non-spiritual branch of the Tradition developed its own esotericism, second-class (if one may say so), since it was limited within the boundaries of the Absolute 111's authodty. In its turn, this ritualistic esotericism gave birth to a whole science, equally traditional and hermetic, with Solomon as its head - Solomon, who is sometimes taken for God himself. Connected with the Temple, this Solomonist tradition of initiation was saved after the destruction of the temple by Titus in 70. This was the Iasr calamity, and gave the signal for the dispersal of Israel. Having become occult, it continued to exist, carefully protected from local Christian per- secutions, until the Arab conquest of PaIestine gave jr a refuge. The ruins of the Temple served as a xallying paint and as a sacred symbol for its adepts. Thanks to the Crusades, contacts were established when European knights came to the Holy Land and settled there. The legend of the Knights Ternplar finding Solomon's treasure in the Temple ruins and making it an object of their special initiations, even though allowed by the Pope, surrounded the White-Coats with the mystical halo of a higher occult science as a complement to their Catholic confession, which remained etlective. Parallel to this the Jews, dispersed all over the world, brought their mysticism, which was of Solomonist origin, into Western Europe, where it flourished in their ghettos during the Middle Ages. By the time it reached us, this Judaeo-Christian or purely Jewish tradi- tion consisted of a large number of treatises, legends and rituals, accorn- panied by an over-abundant literature. Spread across \\Vestern Europe and America, it has become the object of study in the 'lodgeskf different secret societies and the Commandexies of different Orders, as well as fur Chris- tians working in isolation.

It is important to know why. Readers of 'Gnosis%nnw the meaning given by the Doctrine to the idex I of the eter~ai and of etemiby. We touched on them briefly in the previous chapter. In traditional philosophy, which is cyclic and not linear, Eternity is not ' regarded as Infinity. The idea of Infinity goes beyond the limits of Manifestation, since that which has no end natu~lly has no beginning. So, in our theorizing, we only apply the term infinite to that which is beyond the whole Massocosmo~, Great Eternity therefore appears as the Great Cycle of Manifestation, encompassing the whole scale of subordinate Cycles and relative Eternities, as well as all Times, which are also relative. Thus it contains the Beginning -the first creative impulse that begins from the Absolute 0-and goes all the way to the End, that is, to the general and absolute Accomplishment. In this it passes down the whole length of the scale of the Macrocosmos, whlch contains all relative AccornpUshments. The Love from the Absolute 0 fills all Manifestation to its uttermost limits, in all directions and all its specificities, under the aegis of the Absolute I and through the person af the Absolute 11, after which, enriched by all the experience gained from one end of the scale to the other, including the kingdom of the Absolute In, it retutns to its source in a primitive, unrnanifest state at the bean of the Tnexpre~~ible. Certain teachings consider this End of ends as a Gs~eral Annihilufion. This is an aberration caused by the psychological structure of our intellect, which is incapable of conceiving ideas outside time and space, although, in scientific spccuIation and with the aid of mathcmaticaJ ideas, we can reach a generally accepted conclusion of the reiativity of both. It is a question of an abstraction which, pushed to the limit, is out of reach of the imagination to which human beings can claim to have access solely by means of their Personality in its so-called 'normal' state, which is an underdeveloped condition. What we have described above refers to the very Source of Manifesta- tion. At the next degree, which is the first degree of Manifestation, Forming the Great Cycle which is also described as the Cycle of Great Eternity, the human mind halts. It lacks the necessary capacity to encompass this in its entirety, or to retain an image of it that will make it understandable."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The same phenomenon takes place when we try to imagine Life or Manifestation in all its diverse forms, which range from the fine to the coarse, from the dynamic to the inert and rice versa. We do not live among things and phenomena as they are in themselves. Instead we live with representations of them that we make for ourselves using the limited means available to our psyches, Thus the phenomenal world accessible 1 to us is only part of the whole. The remainder is hidden from us because of , our total incapacity to imagine it. Yet we seek solutions to great questions that touch each of us most deeply, such as: are there any permanent values in this Life, and if they exist, how can we discern them? When devotion to an ideal, is taken right up to the supreme sacrifice, is this a mark of heroism or of absurdity? What is the red meaning of death? Etc. Answers to these questions can be found only in the ideas and circum- stances of the invisible world, and they are not perceived by the waking consciousness of the exterior man, however gifted or cultured he may be. Theaphan the Reduse says that 'Here, #either erudiffon, nor ectlesia~fical dknity are gay ~lse.' It is only after the Second Threshold that the awe-struck Faithful begin to progressively discover this world through the medium of their higher centres. About the working of these centres we have aIready quoted the following words of St Isaac the Syrian: 'The sod, like the bo4, has two eyes: brcf while the eyeJ of tbe bo& both see things in the same q, those of the so J see them diferentb; one confernplates the Trivtb in gmboJs and imngcs; the other contemplates if face to face.' Readers of 'Gnosis%ill understand that he was referring to the higher emotional Centre and the higher intellectual Centre respectively. W e said earlier that from time jrnrnemorial the CircIe has 'been con- sidered a Symbol for Efernify, and we pointed out in what sense we should understand this term Eternig. Now, to understand this phrase in its entirety, we have to determine the esoteric meaning of the words Symbol, and @trtboli~m. I f we go back to the origin of the term we will find that by ymbai, ahpopov, the Greeks meant the words and signs by which those initi- ated into the mysteries of Ceres, Cybele and ~ithra,' recognized each 1. UtM, Gallimrd ct Hachcttc, Paris, 1959, p. 2194. other. It was in this spirit that Christianity applied the term Symbol to the Crted of the Faithful, of which thete are three versions: the Apo~tIe~' ~rfed~ (second century), the Nittne Creed {325), which establishes the consubstan- tial nature of the Father and of the Son, and a third that, in the year 380, completed the latter by defining the nature of the Holy Spirit. Beginning with the last century, the word symbol began to assume a wider significance and to lose its original Hellenistic ot Christian mean- ing. For example, in modem Iiteratuse, Symbolism appeared as a reaction to the totally representative art of the Par~as~iun~. Here the symbol is con- ceived as the expression of the intimate relationship existing between two objects, in which the one that belongs to the physical world is supposed to evoke that which belongs to the moral world and so teach the deepest layers of the human soul. This is how people compared the poetry of the Sywbolist-r to music, in which the rhythm and tones generate feelings and emctions that escape analysis. It is clear that in this idea the ybol is understood as a sign created by man to help the communication of his ideas, impressions and messages- in short, everything, however refined, that is situated on the bumutfplune. This conception leaves a Ereat deal of freedom for the creation and inter- pretation o> individual sfrnbols. In short, such a creation is whoIEy the product of the underdeveloped and unbalanced human Personality, and consequently symboIs of this kind, along with the symbolism to which they give birth, have only relative vaIue. The fact that they ate accepted by large sections of human- ity, all belonging to the same civilization, is due to a certain uniformity in the deformation of their Personality -a uniformity that is a reflection of their education and upbringing. It also often happens that this deforma- tion is voluntary due to the hypnotic effect of Fashion-especially in weak natures that wish to appear strong. This usually originates in a fear of being 'outmoded'. This fear can become an obsession that leads to 'avant garde' activities of every sort - in Art, as elsewhere. In the esoteric sense, Symbols are always reveoied, and their deeper mean- ing is precise and cannot be subject to free interpretation, since, whether expressed in human words, diagrams, or works of Art, they express objec- live truth5 that have been reached in a higher state of consciousness. These- fore a symbol that is of value esoterically speaking could be partly or completely understood, depending on the level of consciousness reached by the one who tries to understand its meaning. But the measure to whch it is understood will not change its general meaning, which will remain the same whatever the Ievcl of comprehension. It cannot bc otherwise, since, as we have said, revealed symbols give access to a world that is situated 2- In French, and in Greek, the term ~ymbolis more commonly used to deseribe what in English We COmrnonIy call the rrd (Ed.)"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"beyond simple subjectivism.

Thjs is the case of the Apocahpse that was revealed to St John on the Isle of Pacmos, when he was 'in the ~~irit.'\"hou~h the apostle translated it into human language, this symbol can only be completely grasped by those who have access to the consciousness of the higher cmotionaI centre, which was she state in which St John himself received the revelation. Even the most refined human intellect - available to the Personality in its normal state - is unable to mder~tund the Book of Revelation, because human inteIli- gence, left to its own resources and without the help of a methodical esoteric formation, comes to a halt before the uncrossabte wall d the Unknown: Virchow 's Tporabimw. W e have already underlined how important for esoteric philosophy as well as for mathematics was the discovery of Zero. The modem decimal system, and all that flows from it, would have been unthinkable without the revelation of this symbol. Instead of figures, the numerical system of the Ancients used the letters of their alphabet. Compared to this procedure, the Roman system represented a great step forward, as much because of its simplicity as its universality. In all these systems, instead of Zero, we find a gap: a void. Now, we have already said that Zero is not a vojd; on the contrary, it is an Integral afthe Nrcmbsr~, a centre from which come two series: one positive and the other negative, which are perfectly balanced and go on the one side up to + co , and on the other, down to- m. 3. Revelation i: 10. The formula of this, which has already been shown: - rn * -..- -4,-3,-2,-1,O, +1, +2, +3, +4, .... -+ OO represents the symbol and its Manifestation from the esoteric paint of view. This series may be represented in cyclic form in the EoEIowing way: One may recall that the Arabs, who discovered-or rather, rediscovered -Zero, drew their whole system of nurnbets from it, and that the word c@er that has came across into certain European languages is only a deformation of the Arab word Sifr, which means precisely Zero, since it wax starting from Zsro that the Arab decimal system was created. The following schema represents the geometric design from which the Arabic system of numbers was drawn:"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"We can now understand better why, in traditional knowledge of every nuance, the Circle has aIways symbolized Eferr~ity. Revealed as such, it then evoked a11 Manifestation from Alpha to Omega, from the Beginning to the End, that is, to the ~ulfilment.~ The symbolism of the bare Cide stops at this. It points out the fzct, but it does not explain how Manife~tafion, with all its cosmic systems, was con- ceived and realized. This will be the theme of the following chapters. However, we must remember that the system of Arabic numbers gave us access to Algebra (AJ;iabr), the science of calculating the sizes repre- sented by abstract ideas. This enables the human mind to make definite progress, with innumerable consequences. For instance, it is because of this that we can pass harmoniously from geometric ideas, which are stable and fixed by nature, to the dynamism of higher calculations. 4. On Mount hthos thc monks rcfcr to this by pointingout thcdomcs of thcir churches, which, they say, repwscnt Christ as a sphere whosecentre is everywhere and its circumferencenowhere. (Ed.) I I CHAPTER IX T hough the revelation of the Circle as a symbol for Eternity goes back to times immemorial, it took millennia for the human mind to aban- don its immobility, and so become able to receive a new revelation, one that led it to recognize the Circle as the symbol for Zero, from which it later drew a system of numbers that encompasses the Whole. It js true that, even before the Arabs discovered the Zero, ancient initiates knew that the Circle contained in it a whoIe system of secondary symbols from which the sacred aIphabets were drawn. However, without applying the system of decimal fractions to this, the Cixde remained a petrified figure. It expressed the static form of the Cosmos well, but could not reflect the pubation of life, which is in perpetual movement. To reveal this pulsation, it was necessary to progress from static, 'geometric\" conceptions, to dynamic, 'algebraic' ones. 1 The diagram above (fig. 2) represents this great progress of the human mind: it was precisely by letting his pen wander at random-and so giving it movement - that the Arab managed to build up his system of numbers and figures starting from Zero. Without abandoning thought in the form of repre~entarions, which also exist in animals, it was also possible from then on to cultivate thought based on idem, which only occur in man. This was how man could in time improve his means of investigation, passing pre gressively from concrete speculation to abstractions - in other words, forcing himself to reach out to the sources of the phenomenal world by returning, degree by degree, up the scale of associations from effects to Causes. From then on, the increasing power of human thought did not cease to manifest itself, We know how much the application of algebra enriched Euclidean geometry. New horizons opened up: from plane and spherical trigonometry and analytical geometry with Descartes, to the analysis of infinitesimals with Leibnitz, non-Euclidean geometry with Lobarchevsky, and, finaIly, to all the pure and applied mathematical sciences that today form the prodigious modern scientific arsenal. 1.

(Ed.)"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"T he traditional division of the circumference into 360\" remaine uncontested until the nineteenth century, during which, under th influence of the metric system, someone advanced the Idea of dividing th right angle into 100 degrees instead of 90. This idea was seriously debate[ but was virtualIy abandoned due to the material impossibility of replacing at one stroke the engraved graduations on every precision instrument then in use. This was an impossibility which would in practice have led to the coexistence of the two systems, which would have caused innumerabl- cornpljcatjons in scientific reIatjanships. Apart from this argument, th defenders of the classical method of graduation did not bring up any othe powerful fundamental reason in favour of the 360 degree system. The sirnpIy emphasized the point that the number 400 for the entire circurr ference was less convenient than 360 because it could only be divided b two, four and five, whereas 360 can also be divided by three. If we take rh I series of divisors from 1 to 10, we obtain: for 400 : 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10. and for 360 : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, In the first example, four divisors: 3,6,7 and 9, are missing, while in th second, onIy 7 is missing. This was how the idea of the 400 degree circle was set aside ... reluc tantly, it seems, for even today, for example, slopes are measured i not in degrees. T he reason for and the meaning of the division OF the circumferenc into 360 degrees goes back farther than the above argument, which is comparatively modern. Normally, when making a comparative study of the two numbers, we only consider the practical aspect without concern- ing ourselves about the philosophical meaning, and we are even Ies concerned about the csotcric significance of the division of thc circurn ference into 360 degrees. Yet this division was made by the priests o Ancient Egypt long before the discovery of the zero, and probably well before Euclid. We will see later why this was so. 2. This 15 Conrincntal European practice, now applied also in Britain. (Ed.) W e know that a geometric conscio~~sne~~ is innate in man. A part of the subconsciousness, it is cellular, or in other wotds instinctive. It also exists in animals and in due proportion in plants. We can quote many examples, especially beavers, which cut down young trees to strengthen the dams they build across streams. They construct real villages of mud huts, and divert the course of streams by series of sluices. Bees are another example. Their hives are hexagonal geometric constructions. The habita- tions of ants are shaped as regular cones. These sometimes reach two meters in height. These are just a few examples among thousands of others that point out the geometrical consciousness that exists in animals of every kind. The instinct of plants for geometric equilibrium becomes evident if we stop to think of it. And let us not forget that primitive man knew how to build huts better than beavers: ignorant and illiterate, he nevertheless learned how to build houses that did not fall apart. The core of this geometrical consciousness is common - in different degrees- to all the species that form organic Life on Earth. Geometrical consciousness is not found in the lower intellectual centre, since this centre does not exist in animals and certainly not in plants, but it is located in the intellectual sectors of the motor centre, which can be found in all living creatures, even single cells. With the progressive development of the intellect in honlo sapiens retenr, the instinctive geometric consciousness has partial& risen into the motor sectors of the intellectual centre, where it then plays a part in waking consciousness. This is bow man could progressively make use of it as he pleased, so that this intellectualized geometric faculty has governed his activities since the Stone Age. Culti- vated, it later produced the extraordinary progress in architecture and in the plastic and figurative arts. In the art of war, it manifested itself in the oblique front tactics inaugurated by Epaminondas, adopted by Philip, and then developed and perfected by Alexander the Great. W e know that, apart from the Circle, the first oCthe basic geometric figures is the triangle-especiatly the equilateral triangIe. In esoteric symbolism, this figure plays a primary role as the symbol of the principle of To Be (verb) and of Being (state, existence, quality ~f what is). It marks the upper and lower limits of esotericism. This was the sign attributed to the disciples of the esoteric Didmcalia, and it appears at the summit of the scale of esoteric values as the Dei'tu.

Inscribed in tht circle, the quilateraI mangle divides the circumference into three parts of 120 degrees each.

The Circle with the Triangh aed the Spt inscribed in it forms a spbo of great esoteric importance, with multiple meanings.

For this, it is necessary to complete the above diagram (fig. 3). We will next dm a second equilateral triangle in it, with the apex downwards. The reader will then notice that the vertical diameter of the circle, which passes through the centre of the triangle, is divided into four equal parts. Then, if we draw a radius which passes through the point of intersection ofthe base of the first triangle and one side of the fmt square, we will see that it divides this side, as well as the arc of which it is a chord, into two equal parts. Repeated in the four possible directions, the operation allom us to find the comers of the second imaibd square. This is no longer diamond shaped, but plad upright. This geometric figure is full of symbolic meaning. It is a Paluabie subject for research into the framework of the esoteric cycle in teaching the Doctrine.

This is an objective fact, and it is the red reason, the nataral reasoff, (that is to say, the reason arising from the nature of things) for the secrecy of the mysteries of true Initiation. W e have already said that the circle whose circumference is divided into 360 degrees allows the inscription of several different equilat- eral polygons, each of which, (as well as certain of their combinations), is contained in the complete system of esoteric graphic symbols. These polygons are limited in number: there are TWENTY-TWO in all, starting with the equilateral txiangleB2 In the following list, the two Arabic numbers that appear alongside each of the Roman numerals indicate: first, the number of sides of the polygon, and second, the degrees of the arc of which each side forms n chord.

T he symbols reproduced in the preceding chapter reflect the stmcfwe of the Universe, whose triple principle reappears uniformly as the basis of the whole Macrocosmos, as we11 as of its subordinate organisms from the most primitive to the most complex. Among those belonging to organic Life on Earth, the human organism is clearly the most complete and the mast perfected. In the same way that, in the study of medicine, anatomy precedes phy- siology, in the study of esoteric science it is important to learn the structure of Man before studying his functioning. We have already given an ourline of the functioning of the Universe in the two previous volumes. The description of the three cosmic octaves in the second volume of this work contains aprecist schema1 of this that can be applied to any cosmos^ and is all that is needed for the assiduous reader involved in true esoteric work to progress in ths part of the Gno~is. To succeed, he should fit each problem that interests him into the place it should occupy in the framework of this system, which should be visualized as in movemmt. We know that the system of thtee cosmic octaves embraces the whole Universe with all its parts: the physical, psychological and spiritual organs that form its Bo*, its Sod and its Spirif. We will not get involved in definitions here. For the moment let us simply keep in mind the traditional statement that the Universe is a living Organism and that Man has been created in its image and likeness.\" Now let us &gin our study of Man, who b also made up of these same three elements: Body, Soul and Spirit\" Let us try to do this by placing him among the corresponding three elements of the Universe, under whose direct influence he evolves.

For each of them, this symbolizes the Universe, BU to simplify our study, we will separate the Circle from the polygons. h their turn, the polygons symbolize, in each case, the plane to which th symbol 'belongs, as well as the sphere in which the forces that it expresse find their point of application, i.e., their field of action. When we analyse each symbol and comment on it, it is essential not t~ isolate each from the whole, as the totality forms a closed system whic faithfully reflects the structure of the three cosmic octaves, especially: The Ordogram -- the First cosmic octave. The Hexagram - the Second cosmic octave. The Pentagram - the Third cnsmic octave. Let us now explain what we mean by the study of a schema in mouemenl We already pointed this out when we evoked the image of the Arab wit1 his pen following the lines he had drawn (fig. 2). The conception of th Zero and the system of Arabic numbers flowed fxom the movement of th thoughts and attention of the one who wielded this pen-the movemen was made concrete by thought, and through it the schema came to Iife. Th student should continue in the same way when he studies the symbol: shown as geometric figures, in mote detail. However, he must have som means of approaching this study. The fact that this method afapproach has been bst in the course of tim expIains why these symbols, which were once known to everybody, as least in etementary form, no longer speak to us. They are simply reproduced because it is a tradition, in the same way that we reproduce the signs assigned to the four evangelists without recognizing that they are keys that make possible esoteric study of the related ~as~els.~ This is how we regard the Pentagram on the portico of the Church of she Holy Sepulchre, and also on the shrines of certain saints; how the Hexagram continues to be the syrnboI of Christmas or the incarnation of the Word in the Christian world; how it appears in the Old Testament as the Seal or Shield of King avid;' how, in the Hindu Tradition, we often find it circled by a serpent which bites its own tail; and lastly, how Orthodox priests have an Oct~ gram embroidered in gold thread on the back of their chasubles. Yet people who can explain the profound meaning of thcse symbols or who can give the reason for their use are very rare. T he method of approach that we have just mentioned has two ele- ments. Xt is a question first of the indication (one that the student would find for himself only with difftcutty, because it demands training in epicyclic thought in a contemplative state of mind) of the order in which the study of the symbol should be conducted. This indication will be given further on by the sequence in which the numbers are placed in the sche- mata. The student will later learn that these figures not only represent the line that hjs thought and attention should follow, but that each of these numbers that corresponds to this - and this is essential - also contains a group of ideas on which he should meditate in correlation with the global meaning of each of the three cosmic symbols, and then in relation to what they have in common. Of course this is not easy, but the main thing is to begin. He should then contihue to work with courage and perseverance, and what is lacking will come as a series of successive partial revelations that will be accorded by divine grace to persevering seekers. There is, however, one stumbling-bIock. This is impatience, the wish to get results immediately. If we give way to this desire, we fall into the error which is typical in this kind of research - that is - we will tackle the problem by purely intelIectua1 means. But in this domain, nothing can be acquired by the Cartesian spirit acting alone. This is no longer purely a question of inteLligenct, but also ofwisdom, and a simultaneous and sufficient emotional participation is necessary. Neither the head alone nor the heart alone can lead the student far. We would not know how to pick up an object with onIy one finger: we could touch it or push it, but to hold it, the simultaneous action of two fingers is necessary. If he does not wish to fail, the student who tackles the elements of Gnori~or higher Knowledge must realize from the beginning that work on these symbols requires a simul- taneous cffoa of head and heart. T he second element of the method of approach is the Table of Mojor Numbers. These are the ordinal numbers of the system of twenty-two inscribed polygons whose numbering we have given above. These num- bers are called Major becailse each of them reflects one specific aspect of all the others. The nature of things is such that this property, in its infegral form, disappears abwe the number XXIE. 4. Cf. Vol. I, pp. 180. 5. Sometimes known in English as the 'Star of David'.

This has been known since time immemorial, which is proved by the fact that each of these numbers gave birth to a letter of the sacred alphabets: in the Egypto-Judaic tradition these letters had as prototypes the twenty-two images from which they had been derived. Represented by the letters of the Hebraic alphabet, the twenty-two Major Numbers are known in the Christian Tradition, where they are not associated with images but are systematically revealed in King David's Psalm CXVIII,~ which forms twenty-two verses. (Each begins 6. CXIX in the Revised Version of the English Bible. with n Hebrew letter, in alphabetical order, and is composed of eight lines which form twenty-two octavcs), It is difficult to find a single term that can give the significance for each of the twenty-two Numbers, or for each of the twenty-two letters of the sacred dphabets. This difficulty is because, as a symbol, each of these Numbers in its turn contains a whole bundle of ideas, bound together by a general idea that often escapes the mind that is stiIl untrained in this contemplative research. For exampIe, the number FIVE, in its ultimate generalization, signifies NUTRITION. Now, we have seen how complex is the process of ~utiition.~ The idea of nutrition is inseparable from that of food, and food, being physical, psychological and spiritual, can have either a sensory or an extrasensory nature. From this point of view, we can find all kinds of indications about Knowledge (Savoir), and Savoir-faire, in thc study of the Number FIVE. Clearly a mind that has not been accustomed to speculation of this kind will sun a risk of getting lost in a labyrinth where no Ariadne's thread exists. This is why we give the above Table of Major number^, which views them from apnrficuIarang~e: that of the study of Man in the midst of organic Life on Earth, and within the system of the three cosmic octaves. When using this Tabb, the student should observe and take care not to forget that the Major Numbers, from I to XXI, form three octaves of seven notes. These three octaves, which form the Mojor Triangle, are in one sense included in a Whole represented by the Number XXII, which, in turn, is formed by the last inscribed polygon, which has 360 sides. Making allowances for theprinciple of~mperJection, this polygon is almost identical to the Circle: almost, but not completely, otherwise we would find that the Pro tocosmos was completely stable. Then the principle oflmperfectian would no longer apply, and Life as we can conceive it would cease, When working with the aid ofthis Table the student must also not forget that the significance of the Major Numbers is given here in connection with the problems that are discussed in the Second Part of this volume. Ths means that it is only an indication. It is not definitive. 7. Vol. 11, Chaptcr XI. 8.

In general we can say that, in the first case, symbols are conventional signs. Anyone who has learned their meaning can decipher them. They are created by intellectual means, and anyone who knows the necessary code can decipher them by the same means. The meaning of symbols of this kind can be-and often is-hidden behind a met figure like those used in diplomatic and military cemmunications. The meaning of even the finest and most subtle of these symbols does nor go beyond the jntellcctual level, so that the student can grasp it without the need to undergo a profound transformation of hs being. In addition, such a transformation in him would require more than the simple fact of this kind of iplitiafion. The same goes for someone who dedicates himself to scientific studies. However far he advances, he will find nothing changed in himself. He wjll remain as he was, good or bad, upright or deceitful, generous or avar- icious, however important his discoveries or inventions in the scientific domain. On the other hand, the understanding of esoteric symbols is the result of revelations given by divine grace, and this demands a progressive opening out, in quality and in strength, of adequate faculties latent in the student. One arrives at this through a tension of the will toward the goal of the search. When it is strong enough and properly oriented, this tension resolves itself in a series of partial revelations that axe acquired, and whch lead by stages toward those that are given. These partial revelations can only bc obtained through a double work which, on the one hand, calls for an ardent desire to discover - through this maximum tension of the will - the significance of the symbol being considered. On the other hand, it also demands a simultaneous and equal concentration of the seeker's mind in his inmost being, turned toward his '1'. For this latter aspect of the work, the student who knows how to pray wjll fervently solicit the Eight of Christ. To be fruitEuT, these efforts must be founded on Faith, and they must be pursued in the attitude of tonjdent waitingwhich is characteristic of true sill. The support of Fairh is absolutely indispensable to lead the pupil to"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"achievement. A sceptical attitude, ot even a Cartesian spirit, will close the door that was half-opened to the student through thegiven revelation. This explains a maxim that seems paradoxical at first sight, but to which the Faithhl in the early centuries frequently had recourse in their discus- sions with the Gentiles: 'Ifyou do nor belitwe, neither tviIIyou underrt~~nd!~ It is understood that every acquired revelation, even though partial, marks progress realized by the student in his search and, by this very fact, transforms his being in equal measure. W e can easily see now that, in the first case, there is a secr~f inidintion giving access to conventional signs, and that this can form a scale with a whole series of degrees. In the second case there is no secret trans- mitted from one man to another through purely intellectual channels-nor one that can be kept or betrayed. It is an initinsio~ into a tny~tey: a mystery that by its very narure is open to all, yet is accessible only to those who manage, through effective and generally difficult esoteric work, to raise the level of their being or, in other words, to augment their capacity to contain it. Among other things, this is how we should interpret the following words of Jesus: 'AII mt~ ccannof contain' this $dying, save thy to whom if i~ given.' And further on: 'He that is able to contain it, let him contain it!'2 A s we have already indicated, the first of the three symbols that can be obtained from the Circle and the polygons is the Pentagram, or five- branched triple star. The study of this symbol-in-movement requires pre- cise indication of the order in which the student's attention and his pen- point should pass from one to the other of the branch-points of the three stars through the intersections of the lines that form them. This is how our numbered Pentagram is drawn (fig. 8): The Pentagram numbered in this way was revealed by the author during the lectures he gave at the Faculty of Letters in the University &Geneva. It was also published in the S~~rnmq of these lectures.\" We have already said that this symbol, taken as a whoIe, reflects the real positions of the elements and forces that form the Third Cosmic Octave. The student should apply the meanings of the Major Nwnbsrr to the corresponding figures and study them from this point of view. Here, he will come across the first difficulty: that of interpreting the terms characterizing each of the Major N~mbers. In order to interpret them, he must speciaIIy train himself to think 'in harmony' and not 'in melody', if we may put it this way, In other words, instead of a chain of reasoning he should form a bmdie of idem, of which each section should present a harmonious chorda4 I Then, and only then -keeping the meaning of the whole continually present in his mind-the succession of the figures as it is shown will enable him to make his thought and attention progress according to a precise order and so reach the desired goal.

The problem of ~bm111fc G~o~is is in some way analogous to the problem of navigation. In each case, it boils down to a method of approach that enables one to find a natural and absolute solution to the question posed. The three Great cosmic Symbols, taken together, farm a general library of maps that allow the objective classification of ideas, and give the refer- ences required to answer every question. For, as with navigation, it would be impossible and useless to collect and keep ever-present in the mind all the innumerable elements of the abolsrk Gnosis. It is sufficient to know how to tackIe each particular problem by quickly finding an objective indica- tion to its solution. In addition to the precise 'madne chart', the three Great cosmic Symbols provide us with a way af thinking 'gnostically', in an orderly manner, sheltered from deviations that would otherwise happen under the influence of the Law of Seven. In the next chapter we will describe a general method- taken from the high tradition- for studying the properties of Numbers. This is a graphic method which makes it possible to find appropriate references for any situation in the different aspects of the three Great cosmic Symbols. Then, using this method, we will bring out whatever will make possible the practical study of the problems that concern us more closely, that is, those of adarnic Man and pre-adamic or anthropoid Man, both of these being in the midst of organic Life on Earth and, with this, in the whole Universe in which we live. CHAPTER XI11 (7) E ver since ancient Egypt, scholars have pored aver the properties of numbers, especially the Major N~mbers. From the study of these on the banks of the Nile, a science developed which spread throughout Greece with the mysteries of Orpheus and the teachings 05 Pythagoras and Plato, and was introduced as part of the complete traditional Christian Gnosis simultaneeusly with the HcIIenic initiatory wisdom. This science was confirmed by Jesus several times during his lifetime, and it was enriched after the Resurrection by revelations made to the tad or it^, Peter, James and John. Transmitted orally from generation to genera- tion, it is partly revealed today - in a measure appropriate to, and suffj- dent to fulfiLl, needs that have come to light simuttaaeous1y both on the esoteric plane and on the public plane. These needs appear in the midst of the Time of transition where humanity finds itself at present, which must lead it either toward a happy outcome and the Era of the Holy Spirit, or coward failure and the Deluge of Fire. W e know that a knowledge of the properties of numbers is also an objective of positive science, and that studies based on this subject form an important and highly instructive branch of mathematics. How- ever, these studies, interesting in themselves, are too abstract because they are never viewed in a cosmic context, Again, we remind the reader that in every scientific study, to achieve concrete results, it is essential iofolloav aplan that carreponds to the struciwre of the o&ect studied. Considered from this angle, the contents of the preceding chapters bring into relief a remarkable effort of the human mind, one that has made possible the interception of divine revelations and their trans- mission to posterity. To conceive an idea of the system that is briefly described in the second part ofthjs volume, it is necessary tograsp and accept the fundamental idea that the structure of all Creation, as a whole and in the smallest detail, is based on Numbers. Linked with the principle just stated, this idea, (whether revealed or acquired) has made it possible to take the study of the properties of Numbers nut of the domain of abstract speculation. The system of the twenty-two equilateral inscribed polygons, From which the XXII Major Nmbers and the sacred alphabets were derived,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"completed by the three Great Symbols (corresponding to the Three Cos- mic Octaves), contains a summarized version of all, the revelations and of all the results of the conscious efforts made by the ancient Sages, by the Apostles, and by their spiritual descendants. The present description forms a whole, which organically corresponds tl the cosmic structure seen from this angle: however succinct it may be, th elements it contains should be sufficient to allow valuable research to b carried out on any particular problem related to it. This is not all: we still have to show the method that was employed i ancient times, which was first Hellenized, then Christianized, and wa. finally modernized by the application of the system of decimal fractions that was the result of the discovery of the Zero and of Arabic nurnkrs. I n ancient times, to make a systematic study of the properties of Num- bers, scholars had to resort to a geometric method, since algebraic ideas did not then exist. This method is based on three fundamental elements: the Circle, symbol of Eternity, the Law of Three (of creation) and the Law of Seven (of func- tioning), and it requires a compass and a ruler as working instruments. The reader of ths work knows that all living creation begins from the Law qTAree and is subject to the LUIV of Smen. He also knows that because of the application of the latter law to Creation by the will of the Absolute, the great Octave is completed by two elements intended to GI1 the intervals between the notes DO, SI, FA and MI respectively. However, he will now understand this divine artifice better. We have already given an explana- tion of it in the first two volumes of 'Gnosis' but we will repeat it here to emphasize the marvellous plan that enables everyone and everything to exist in space and in time: a) to curve Time by means oE the Law of Seven, giving it a cyclic nature to prevent 'Chronos from devouring his children,' at least, not immedi- ately; b) then to till the intervals separating the notes DO and SI, FA and M respectively by using the system of the Three Cosmic Octaves. Thus completed, the Great Octave comprises nine autonomorrs elements: ii seven notes and the two intervals, now filled. If, to close the cycle an reflect the natural cyclic process in the schema, we add the final DO, tk arrive at ken a~tonomorcs elements. 1 1. The decimal system was derived from this reasoning, which Pythagotas brought from Egfl to Greece. Starting from these, the Andents divided the circumference of the circle into nine equd pans. To each of these they attributed corresponding numbers from one to nine. Placed at the top of the circle, the Zero was covered by the numbe IX, as in the schema below: It wauid be superfluous here to describe the way in which they reasoned in ancient times, when letters took the place of numbers.\" The road they had to follow was much longer and less practical. Now, we wiU go on to explain the method in its modernized form. H idden behind the number IX in the schema above, the Zero repre- sents the beginning and end of the cycle, rhe whole of which is characterized by the Major Number X, which signifies Ue and VLBRA- TION, that is, mwement that is itself cyclic. At fist it may be a little d3Tinzlt to admit that every number represents a living being, but we could accept this idea easily if, instead, we regarded it as a liviffg gmbol. It is in this sense that we can say that every number, especially every Major Number, is much more that a conventional sign intended for some spdc nomenclatute or classification offacts and ideas. In addition to filling this role, a number that is correctly interpreted reveals the nature and process ofLife, considered from theviewpoint to which it is orgmicaI4 Iinrked. 2.

We have also shmn how, in the studies now presented, we follow the method in modernized form, although we have kept the ancient sequence of its logic unchanged. But we must be exact about the fact that- as one can easily understand- this 'modernization' is more than a millennium old. The modernized geometric method of studying the properties of num- bers was conceived and is carried out, for each number given, like a graphic operation that is applied to the basic schema (fig. 11). This is performed by following the figures that form the decimal fractions obtained by successive division of the numbers, starting from 1, 2, 3 ... etc. ... up to the number studied, which obviously closes the cycle, sym- bolizing the operation achieved by the formula: x : x = 0.999999 ... = 1 For our esoteric research, special importance is attached to the proper- ties of the two following Major Numbers: XI11 - DEATH and VII - LIVING MATTER These numbers symbolize the two great problems of Life, on whose solution depend the salvation of our Psyche (the Personality) on the individual pIane, and, on the general plane, a happy outcome far the Time of transition and-in consequence-the fate of humanity as a whole- In the next chapter we will analyst these two Major Numbers, using tb method we have aIready explainedn3 3.

CHAPTER XIV L et US Gegin to study the two Major Numbers we have picked out, XITl and VII, in that order. These numbers characterize two great cate- gories of human beings who coexist on our planet and constitute two h~manitier at the heart of organic Life on Earth. In the fitst volume of 'Gnasis', we had already referred several times to this coexistence of two essentially different races: one of Men, and another of Antbropidr. We must emphasize the fact that from the esoteric point of view the latter term has no derogatory meaning. First constated very long ago, this fact, although it has been distorted because it is generaIIy seen in a false light, was part of the national, social and judicial consciousness of many ancient and modern peoples. One finds its influence in the Indian idea of the Utrdo~~cbable, the Greek Helot, the Jewish Gy, the medieva1 European white Bones and black Bones, the Ger- man Nazi Untermetfsch, etc. ... IncidentalIy, the legend of b1~e blood does not belong to the domain of pure fantasy. The error is not in the conception of blue blood as a 'psy- chosomatic' phenomenon, but in the naive medieval bekf that this so- called aristocratic blood passes nutomatically from father to son. Readers of'Gnosisa will easily understand the reasons why this attribute can belong only to twice-barn beings. We must also note that the other extreme, the equalitarian conception of human nature, so dear to the theoreticians of democratic and socialist revolutions, is also erroneous: the only reaI equality of subjects by inner and international right is equal$ of pos~ibilitie~, for men are born unequal. T he Scriptures contain more than one reference to the coexistence on our planet of these two humanities-which are now alike in form but unlike in essence. We can even say that the whole dramatic history of humanity, from the fall of Adam until today, not excluding the prospect of the New Era, is overshadowed by the coexistence of these two human races whose separation will occur only at the Last Judgment. It is to this that Jesus referred in parables when he spoke to the crowds, but described in clear terms for the benefit of his disciples; the most noteworthy"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"description is the parable of the and the~ogood reed: on which he made the following commentary when asked to do so by his disciples: 'He thut swetb thegood seed is the Son of man: thtfiedd is the world: thegood seed are the children of the kingdom: b~t the tares are fba children of t&t wicked one: the enemy that wed them is tbe dwil: the hawest is the e J of the ~e>us then added: '... every sde which is in~trwted ~nto the kingdom of beuvea is like ~to a man that ir a borrseholder, which bringeth forth o~t of hir frea~~re things old and The coexistence of a race of Anthropoids and a race of Men, confirmed here, is necessary, from the point of view of the General Law, to maintain uninterrupted the riahifig in mouement of organic life on Eaxth. It is also necessary because of the Principle of Equilibrium. The first race is a counterbalance which allows the race of Men to pursue its esoteric evolution. Jesus confirmed thls when He spoke about the End in the following terms: 'Tbm, shll fwo be in the jeIA; the one sbuIibe taken, and the other left. Two mmen rhnll be grinding at fhc mill; the one rhdi be taken, and the other l~$.'~ These words call for comment: tares grow without having to be cuIti- vated. Good seed, on the other hand, demands a great deal of care if it is to bear fruit: the land has to be ploughed, fertilized, the seed sown carefuIly, and the sail harrowed, etc., and even so, if the crops are not harvested but left where they grow, nor one sheaf of wheat will be left at the end of a few years, as the taxes, which grow naturally from the Earth, stifle the wheat and barley, which arc fruits of heavenly cultivation. 5 T he human tares, the anthropoid race, are the descendants of pre- adamic humanity. The principal difference between contemporary pre-adamic man and adamic man -a difference which is not perceived by the senses -is that the former does not possess the developed higher centres that exist in the latter which, although they have been cut ofTfrom his waking consciousness since the fall, offer him a red possibility of 1 esoteric evolution. Apart from this, the two races are similar: they have the same lower centres, the same structure of the Personality and the same physical body, although more often than not this is stronger in pre-adamic t 1.

By applying the method already described to the first: of these two numbers we obtain the following series: 1 : 13 = 0.076923 ... 2: 13 = 0.153846 ... 3 : 13 = 0.230769 ... 4 : 13 = 0.307692 ... 5 : 13 = 0.384615 ... 6 : 13 = 0.461538 ... 7 : 13 = 0.538461 ... 8 : 13 = 0,625384 ... 9 : 13 = 0.692307 ... 10 : 13 = 0.769230 ... 11 : 13 = 0.846153 ... 12 : 13 = 0.923076 ... 13 : 13 = 0.999999... We may notice that the decimal fractions flowing from this series of operations are of two different initial types: 1) 0.076923.. . and 2) 0.153846 ... and aIthough they are derived from different numbers, the fractions below contain the same fipres, and these follow each other in the same order. This, as we will seein a moment, gives birth to two independent figures within the circle {fig. 12). If we mark the first series by the letter x and the second by the lettery, we obtain the following perfectly balanced formula for the whole group of the first twelve fractions: x+y+2x+4yf 2xt.y-t-x which comptises 6 x and 6 y in all, of which the values are: Gx = 2.999999 ... 6.

We may notice that when it is analysed in the same way as the number XITI, a series of six fractions of a single type flows from the number VII, each composed of the same figures. They occur in a different order, yet always in the same sequence. If we mark each fraction with the letter 2, their total is found to be: 62 = 2.999999 ... from which: Gz = Gx, just as 62 = by On the other hand, at the limit, the 62 will form the number 3; and if we add the value of the seventh fraction of the series: 7 : 7 = 0.999999 ... = 1 we obtain 3+1=4 or, according to the transcription allowed for the Major number^: IH+I = IV B efore passing on to interpret the results we have obtained in this way, let us inscribe the twelve first fractions derived from the number 13 and the six first fractions from the number 7 in the circle that was divided earlier (fig, 11); T he Major Number XIIZ, which, when malysed, gave us the following quation: VI + I = VII describes the law to which ZiYing Mat#cr WI) is subject, created to form the physical and psychological bedies of creatures of every species at the different degrees of the cosmic scale. In the present case, it forms the bodies of those creatures whch form organic Life on Earth, Thus, the existence of bodies of all species (I) is ensured by the law of perpetual renewal (VI), that is, by the interplay of the two extremes: of birth and death. During its ephemeral existen=, the principal biological characteristic of living matter is the capacity to absorb and assimilate mined, vegetable and animal elements through the equally ephemd process of N#ftrftrh, and ejm the residue. Since the Merent species are nourished on dements as ephemeral as themselves, although on a different scale, we will see that the process of tetenewal has two aspects: on the one hand, living matter eats in order to"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"exist, on the other it is also eaten in its turn, in some way or other in the great cycle of corntic N~fsition of which we have already spoken. 8' This law, in whch matter exists in time through the perpetual renewal of species and devours while waiting to be devoured, is common to the three notes LA, SOL and FA of the Second cosmic Octave. Together, these notes make up organic Life on Earth, and in the midst of this pre-adamic man, the creature of the VIth Day, finds the place assigned to him by this law in the note LA, while his psyche derives from the note SI. But Adam was not created on the VIth Day, ar the same time as pre- adamic man and the animals. The Book of Genesis tells us that he was created on the VlIIth Day, after God had consecrated the VIIth to His rest.' The process of his creation was not simple, as with the man of the VIth Day. Like the latter, Adam was createdfirst, and cenceivedlater. As far as his hylic body was concerned, he was treated in the note LA, but of a light matter-the dust of the ground. His psychological body was also created- this was in the note SJ. But his pneumatic body was conceived in the 'I', through direct contact with the Absolute 11, from which he received the Breath of Life, the divine essence that dominates ephemeral life and, accord- ing to the Scriptures, turns it into a livitg~oul.\" This is added to his hylic substance and that of his psyche, both of them of a higher nature, although still brrman. This process, accomplished by means of the higher centres of consciousness through which Adam was linked with the mind (inteiIigtnce) tf~hrirt,',\" is symbolized by the Majot Number ~1I.l~ The analysis of the latter Number led to the formula: I11 + I = IV in this the Majot Number IV intervenes as the Love of the Androgyne, which is therefore i~tegral in itrperpetwal vibration. It acts through the Breath of Lge, the emanation of the Love of the Absolute I1 that Adam received in the '£' of the Second cosmic Octave. Doubled by the feminine Love (111) of Eve, who had been created from him and not outside hjm, the Androgy- nous ADAM-EVE represented the true and complete Microcosmos, called on to form a higher human race - a race of Sonr of ~od,'~ or leaders responsible for the development of organic Life on Earth according to the divine Plan of Creation. This race, because of its particular nature, was not intended to participate in animal reproduction, nor in the alternating sequence of birth and death. 8. Vol. 1.,p.I35,fig. 47.

I n the next chapter we wilI come back to the question of the coexistence of the two human races b$re and after the Fall. For the moment, Iet us try to grasp the esoteric symboIism of the Major Numbers XI11 and VII from the practical point of view. Tf we now refer to figures 12 and 13, we will notice that the physiology of adamic man before the Fall was essentially different from that of the creatures of the VIth Day of Creation, pie-adamic man included. Whereas God had wilIed for these creatures an ephemeral existence, subject to the law of birth and death so that the internal between FA and MI ofthe Great Octave could be filled, Adam, the man of the VIIIth Day, was created and conceived under the law of permanence to which the breath of life received from the Absolute II entitled him. In other words, whereas pre-adamic man was provided with only one nature, a human essence, adarnic man was endowed with a dual nature: one part buman but superior, coming from the finest expression of the notes LA and SI, and the other dZYine, coming from the Y or breath of God. Incidentally, we may note that this throws light on the Christian dogma of the dual nature of Jesus christ.14 As the Son of Man in the midst of a corrupt and degenerate mixed humanity, the Son of God represented the New Ahm, the perfect prototype of adamic man before the Fall, posses- sing in full and manifesting the tightpwers that enable one to dominate the nature of things.I5 Simultaneously, the deeper meaning of the word 'Gospel' is unveikd - the Good News, the written record of the divine revelation which offers corrupted adamic man a practical possibility of Redemption. W e will better understand now that figures 12 and 13 form two Ennea- gram. One (fig. 12), which we wil1 call Enneagram \"A, refers to pre- adamic man; the other (fig. 131, which we will call Enneagram 'B', refers to adamic man - to the Adam formed 'of the dwst of the grormd,' as he was before receiving the Brfatb of L$. 14.

Consequently, Adam's body was of a simpler structure than, that of the Man of the VIth Day - a fact which sands out clearly when we compare the two enneagrarns. But as well as its terrestrial nature, Adam's lighter body received the Breath of Life, a supernatural gift that is represented by an independent addition to the Enneagtam 'B', derived from the first analysis of the Major Number VII. This addition, which expresses in esoteric terms the penetration of the divine breath into Adam\" body, mkes the form of a Trilitlgh whose three vertices are placed at points 3,6 and 9 of the circumference - points that are vacant in Enneagram 'IS'. Completed in this way, the figure appmrs like this: We will immediately observe that without this Triangle, and so without breatb, neither Adam nor any other adarnic man would have been able to exist. Although simple and fine, the natml Enneagram 'B', when it is without the triangle, does not contain the necessary elements for even an ephemeral existence; this is why God put His breath into Adam's body as soon as He had formed it of fine matter-the dtrst ofthepmd.

Pre-adamic man was intended for a purely ephemeral existence, and even ths would not have been possible without the triangle 3-6-9. As we can see in Enneagram 'K, two sides of this triangle, 3-9 and 6-9, were already naturally derived from the analysis of the Major Number XIII: only the side 3-6, the base aE this incomplete triangIe, was missing. This base was added artificially, that is, from the outside - just as was the whole triangIe for Adam- but this time, it was not by a direct breath from God, jointly communicated b the AbsoIute I and the Absolute IT - 7 a#d ny Farhrrorc ona,'said ]esuj7-but by the Absolute 111, or Sarhanael, making Sex and the force of earthIy Lave contribute to this end. his difference between the triangles inscrjbed in the two Enneagrams Tis full of esoteric significance. Before the fall, adamic man was an IniYid~~uIity, thanks to the breath received directly from God. He was truly placed at the level of man seven, and in any case, he was irnmor- tal. After the fall, identified with his Personality and enclosed in a body that was becoming coarser, he became rnorta~.'~ Yet he retained jn latent form the power ta 'redeem%mself, especially after the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who came to announce the GoodNews to him and to reveal the possibility of his becoming an Individuality again by mastering first his Personality, then his body, and finally, by the Second Birth, regaining his original immortality in the bosom of the Lord. Thus, aIthough adamic man in his corrupt condition-that state that is generally falsely considered as 'normal'-has become a Personality U ke the pre-adarnic, he still remains an Individuality because of the Breath he received. But he is only an Individuality in potential, and his real goaI in life, which is the objective of esoteric work, is to realize this potential. re-adamic man was never an Individuality. Created as a Personality an P the VIth Day, he is deprived of every possibility of direct, 'individual' 17. John x: 20. 18.

For the moment, we will leave Enneagram 'A\" aside, and make our principal, commentaries on Enneagram 'B'. The latter interests us most, since it symbolizes adamic man, who, even in his present corrupt condition, is capable of esoteric progtess. We know that in most wesscrn languages the sun - situated at the top point of the Enneagram, and the six ancient planets, have given their names, slightly modified, to the days of the week. In Latin, the succession of terms is perfect: Dies Solis Dicr hw Dies Marhi Dier Mermk Dies Jouis Dies Vcncri~ Dies Satmi The traditional syllables that designate the musiml notes also show their connection with the Great ~ctave,'%whh shows clearly that the Ennagram preserved in the Tradition was wdl-known in ancient times, Enneagram 'A' is a symbol with limited signiftcance, confined to the organic Life of soma and psyche on Earth, vegetable, animal and hum; Enneagram 'B', whose pIace is in the centre of the Cosmos, is a universal symbol. It has n multitude of aspects and meanings that it would be vain to try to describe in detail, for as St John said, even the world itself could not contain all the books that could be written on hs subject. Besides, such a work would be of little use, since Enneagram 'B', whch contains the whole Gtfosi, provides a lund of miver~aief that enables us to penetrate everydung, providing, of course, that one uses it correctly in the search for Knowledge and Savoir-Faire. For example, without a single exception, all the schemata which appear in the volumes of 'Gnosis' are derived from it, and, conversely, each of them reflects one ot other of its aspects. The Enneagraa has many other aspects, each of which can prwide the elements for one or more esoteric symbols. The traditional esoteric 19.

This is the general meaning of Enneagram 'B', which is the cosmic symbol appropriate to 'terrestrial- celestial' adamic man. The scale of Hydrogens that relates to ths contains six degrees, from H 768 to H 12, and we must not forget that the Zero, with the Hydrogen 6 that corresponds to it, is hidden behind the number 9. This aspect of the Enneagram deals with adamic man in his terrestrial and celestial constitution. It would bc different if we were visualizing other cosmic entities superior to man, of which there are only two big groups in the ~osmos:~ here, the geometric outline of the symbol would remain the same. Neither the figures showing the order of the points, nor the notes would change, but the astrological signs and the type-substances c the Hydrogens would be different.24 T he fjrst big complex of organs, governed by the series 1-4-2 and the notes RE-FA-MI, consists of the threegroups of organs of the human body that ensure, respectively, the digestion25 - RE, the circulation - FA, and the respiration - MI. The order in which these three notes of the first octave of nutrition26 have been taken corresponds to that of the first three figures of the decimal fraction 0.142857.. . and indicates the course fol- lowed in the organism by the transmutation of the fine matters: H384 - H96 - H192. At first sight, this seems paradoxical. To understand the process better, the reader should refer to chapter XI of the second volume of 'Gnosis'. He will then see that the transmutation of Hydrogens takes place according to several parallel processes, some of which follow the circumference of the Enneagram in numerical order, while the others, in the epicyclic sequence, continue by using previously accumulated reserves of Hydrogens. Here a group of Zittear transmutation processes follows the numerical order: RE H 384 - MI H 692 - FA H 96, while another group follows an epicyclic course: RE H 384 - FA H 96 - 23. Cf. Vol. II, Ch.

MI H 192 which, in a healthy human organism, ensures the balanced functioning of the groups of organs in question. We may say, ratighb, that in a certain sense the three groups of organs governed by the figures 1-4-2 and the notes REFA-MF of the first octave of nutrition together farm the instrument for the Hydrogen-pradilcing transmutation. In a normal healthy organism, whose activity reaches opfim~~m, the note FA 9G gives out a clear and powerful soutrd. Hydrogen FA 96 is the animal magnetism which radiates in the interior of the organ- ism as the& of the blood, and passes out to the exterior through the skin, after which it obeys the law that governs all radiating energy. It is impor- tant for every man - and even more so for every student of Gnosi- to closely observe the way his FA 96 'behaves', for ifthe disciple is to cross the First Threshold easiIy and embark on she Staircase with any chance of success, its resonance must have both przrity and strength. he three groups of organs governed by the three other figures of the T decimal fraction 0.142857 ... that is, 8-5-7, and by the notes of the first octave with the Hydrogens that correspond to them: ST 12, SOL 48 and LA 24, form a second ensemble within which the transmutation continues, but its output of fine energies is destined to be expended rather than accumuIated. This definition, however, is made with certain reserva- tions. It demands circumspection, as we must not forget that this con- cerns an organism and not a mechanism. In the first group, the transmutations are almost excIusively intended for internal use: onIy the surplus Hydrogen H 96 radiates to the outside. In the second group, however, a great part of the energies produced, above the mini- mum required to maintain the physical body in good condition, serve the psychic life of the '1'. This is how the energy SOL 48 serves as matter for thought, while the energy LA 24 makes the motor and lower emotional centres function-the former completely and the latter in part, that is, only the negative part. Lastly, the sexual group is activated in its direct func- tions by the energy SI 12. But we must not forget, here or elsewhere, that this transmutation also has a direct or linear path: SOL 48 - LA 24- SI 12; and an epicyclic path that begins from previously accumulated reserves of energy SI 12, and that it is also subject to an indirect pressure coming from the breath. This epicyclic sequence, which foIlows the line 8-5-7, goes from SI 12 to SOL 48 and from SOL 48 to LA 24. When reserves of LA 24 energy begin to fall below a certain level, we feel hunger. At that moment a certain of this energy is projected to RE 384, to give it the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"impetus that will set it moving and, through adequate glandular secretions, will make it prepare the organism for the absorption and digestion of food. T he transmutation of the Hydrogens in this first octave can continue beyond SI 12 in two ways: ordinary and extraordinary. The ordinary, direct transmutation of ST 12 into DO G takes place in a natural way in the normal sexual act, which fills the interval between these two notes. When the act ends, the transmutation is completed by conception, where, united in the genetic orgasm, the male SI 12 and the female SI 22 conceive a new, independent embryonic life, which will follow its own way and develop through a descending scale. In the second case, the extraordinary transmutation, all the surplus SI 12 energy, which is ejected from the organism for the price of the pleasure obtained by carnal love, can be accumulated in the organism and undergo an internal transmutation. This extraordinary transmutation is indirect. It does not take place in an instinctive, natural way, as with conception. It can only result from the conscious efforts of those who are progressing on the Staircase and have attained the thitd step. We wit1 come b3ck to this important question in more detail toward the end of the present volume. For the moment we will leave aside the question of 'how', and will only describe the alchemical technique of the process. Like the first, this second mode of transmutation has three stages, which we can regard as analogous to befrotbal, marriage, and roncepfioa. It is true that we ate still dealing with Love, but here it acts on the higher plane of the Cartrtb he that unites the Knight with the Lady of his dreams. During the first stage of this Love, instead of being ejected from the physicaI and psychic organisms of the man and woman, the energy SI 12 is preserved in them both by being associated laterally with SOL 12, the fifth note of the octave of respiration. The happy climax of this process is felt like an irresistible sexual attrac- tion, but of a higher, purely psychic order, and the fresh energy of the SI 12, uniring yncbronous@ with SOL 12 in the two organisms, communicates a new impetus to the latter; the couple feel a wave of high inspiration flowing through them and opening up surprising perspectives. Apart from very rare cases, the couple - the Knight and his Lady - realize this state of higher inspiration only after they have practised courtly Love for a more or less prolonged period; fox only courtly Love can provoke this new impulse that comes from SI 12 turned towards their interior. This is because the SOL 12 is already the fifth note of the respiratory gamut, so that the loss of charge at this distance, in the 'fallen' condition of the couple, is such that it barely responds any more. But, under the effect of this powerful impetus coming from the SI 12, the couple experience a union of the psyche which can be compared with nothing else, a foretaste of the androgynous consciousness. In thjs way the Knight and his Lady reach the stage of the mystical betrothaiand receive a benediction from Abwe through the mediation of the higher emotional Centre. If the couple attains the desired degree of emotional tension through courtly Love practiced in this way, the SOL 12, aroused by the strength of the SI 12, will communicate an inflow of energy to MI 12, the third note of the octave of impressions. Keeping in mind the epicyclic currents, the reader will understand the power of this iriph Hydrogen 12 that comes from the two sexes and combines in itself the SI 129, the SOL 12s, and the MI 12s, all three vibrating fully in both partners. The successful unfolding of this process can provoke a state where the masculine and feminine energies coming from the SI 12, aided in both the man and the woman by two other Hydrogens 12, unite in an ecstasy -in the consciousness of their bipolar real 'I:, which is ONE and indivisible for the two elements of the couple. Tn this way the marrdage of the psyche, which is the crowning of courtly Love, is consummated: after this, the Knight and his Lady will be forever fused together in their androgynous consciousness, whatever the outer circumstances and even in spite of death. On the Fifth Wq, this is the fitst tangible result obcained through a sustained and conscious effort for the sublimation of sex. I t is necessary to state here that the subIirnation of sex is not an aim in Itself, but a means. It has four degrees, of which the three that follow the ecstasy of the mystical marriage appear in an order opposite to that in which courtly Love had led the couple to the androgynous consciousness. The second is the synergjc and synchronous passage from MI 12 to FA 6 in both the man and the woman, a passage which is instantaneous and has an effect analogous to conception. The third degree is the passage from SOL 12 to LA 6 wh~ch happens gradually and demands time: we can compare this with the stage ofpregnuny; lastly, if nothing happens to stop the process, the couple reach the fourth degree, the simultaneous passage from SI 12 to DO 6: this is the Birth, the ThirdBirtb which, with the crossing of the Third Threshold, opens up th way that will lead the Knight and the Lady of his thoughts towards the empyrean of the Plerama."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"It is easier to understand now why it is such an error for the evolved adamic man and woman who have reached the third Step of the Staircase and are about to climb the fourth, that of Love, to continue to eject the SI 12 energy from their organisms for the sake of ephemeral pleasure, when its accumulation, its mastery, and its judicious orientation toward the act of courtly Love, can open the door to the lost Paradise for them. The reader may now also understand the deep meaning ofplatonic he, something that is so often misinterpreted. T o outline the possibilities for the transmutation of higher Hydrogens within the organism of adamic men and women, we have already in a small way anticipated our explanation. But now let us return to the study of the evolution of the gamut of respiration with the aid of the Enneagram. We have already seen2' that without the intervention of DO 192, the evolution of the first octave of nutrition will not go beyond the leveI of MI 192, If respiration stops, the death of the organism follows, and the first act of the newborn is the cry that begins the process of respiration which is the affirmation of life. But to activate the MI 192, the DO 192 must surrender a part of its energy to it. Now, in spite of the weakening effect this has on the latter, it must still give an impetus to the evolution of its own gamut. In the case where living conditions are natural, that is, where we work in the open air - an air that is pure and rich - and where our muscles are well exercised, the circulation will be stimulatcd so that the quantity of DO 192 energy introduced into the organism wjth the breath will be enough to meet both needs in full. But when we live in the con- ditions of a 'civilized' life, which is an unhealthy way of life from all points of view-especially jn towns-respiration is generally incornpIete and uses polluted air, so that the amount of DO 192 energy taken in is far from adequate. For the same reasons, because of the bad quality of our food, the first gamut of nutrition is inadequately developed, so that the motor centre must draw additional DO 192 energy from the breath to alleviate the chronic shortage of MI 192. This even further reduces the transmutation of the Hydrogens passing through the gamut of the breath, which is already very much below the normal level. Adamic man in his corrupt state no longer knows how to actively draw the energy DO 48 from his 27. Voi. 11, p. 121, 122. impressions. This energy is intended to fill the interval between MI 48, the energy of active thought, and FA 24, the energy of attention, which are both practically exhausted every day. This means that adamic man can never accumulate a sufficient reserve of the energy SOL 12 to pass spon- taneously to LA 6 following the linear steps of the transmutation of Hydrogens. The epicyclic movement between the three groups of organs takes place in the order 8-5-7, that is, SOL 12- MI 48-FA 24. Obviously, with this chronic deficiency of SOL 12, this movement does not bring any substan- tial aid. Yet the epicydic action of SOL 12 is necessary to activate the third gamut of nutrition, that of impressions. By communicating a complernen- tary impulse to MT 48 and FA 24, SOL I2 creates the conditions necessary for a man to pass to the practice of constatation of his own impressions-an indispensable condition for DO 48 to begin to act. The transmutation of the Hydrogens can then begin: from DO 48 it passes without difficulty to RE 24, then from RE 24 to MI 12; once there, it stops before the interval that sepatates MI 12 from FA 6. We have already seen how this stage in the transmutation of Hydrogens can become active through the practice of courtly Love on the Fifth Way. I t follows rhat the disciple who wishes to connect his higher centres with his waking consciousness must possess a vigorous and healthy organ- ism, and must be in conditions where he can obtain the best food and air to breathe, and will be nourished with abundant impressions of good quality. Besides this, he must produce in his organism a sufficient quantity of Hydrogen 12 and Hydrogen 6 - one being of a different shade\" from the other. We must underline the fact rhat we can never obtain this result in a natwul way; it is necessary to make sustained and conscious efforts oriented towards: a) The constatation of one's everyday impressions, and above all, those that ffow from the reIationship uniting; the Knight and the Lady of his thoughts in courtly Love - (first voluntary shock). b) The redirection of the SI 12 sexual energy produced through the sexual attraction felt by the couple, from the act of carnal love to that of courtly Love - (second uoimtuy shock). In the third part of the present volume, which js dedicated to the LIFE, that is, to real life, we will giveafew indications that will enable the disciple to make a practical approach to this double, and doubly vital, problem. 28.

Before the fall, the adamics came under the sole authority of the Absolute IT, and they played their part in the note SI under the impulse of the J, of the second cosmic octave.?hc two humanities, coming from the two different creative processes, Iater mingled on the Ievel of organic life on Earth, which comes under the authority of the Absolute 111. From then on, the coexistence of these two human types, and the competition that was the result of this, became the norm. Now, '0s the children of thix world are b theirgeneration more abh than tble children of~igbt'~ we can see that throughout the centuries, even in our own day, adamics in their post-fall condition, have been and are generally in an inferior position to the pre-adamics. Further on, this situation, with its practical consequences and problems, will be the object of a deeper study. This is necessary because the Era of the Holy Spirit is approaching, at the end of which the question of the separa- tion of the tares from thegoodseedwill arise. For the moment we will restrict ourselves to repeating that contemporary adamic man, having lost contact with his higher centres and therefore with his real '1', appeaxs practically the same as his pre-adamic counterpart. However, unlike the latter, he still has his higher centres, which ensure that he has the possibjl ity of following the way of esoteric evolution. Atpre~etrt, pre-adamic man is deprived of this possibility, but it will be given to him if adarnic humanity develops as it should during the Era of the Holy Spirit. T he third stage of the Creation of adamic humanity, when Woman appeared, is like the second in that we find a process totally different from the one that gave birth to pre-adamic humanity. In the latter case, woman was created independently of man but in a like manner: Eve was created afer Adam, and after he had received the Breath of Life. She too was not created directly from, the d~sf ofthe earth: but indirectly from an - 1. UoI. II, p. xxxvi. 2. Luke xvi: 8; nftcr the Slavonic tcxt. 3. Gmesis i: 27. 4.

Throughout this work, we have seen several times the considerable sum of efforts and superehrts that are demanded of the adamic man, who, after having recognized his real position in life, resolutely crosses the First Threshold and climbs the Staircase to attain and pass the Second Threshold with its promised Redemption. Pre-adamics are not subject to these fits of anguish and these permanent inner conflicts; not that they live in perfect peace, or are never troubled by conflicts - far from it - but in most cases their conflicts take place in the interior of tbe Per.mnali9, between different groups of the little 'I's which produce these conflicts, As a result, the chatacter of their conflicts is purely psychic, and they arc generally resoIved by some kind of compromise. The more acute confflcts that take place in pre-adamic man occur between the 'I\" of the Personality and the 'I' of the body. We have dwelt at length on this subject in volume I1 of Gnosis, emphasizing the [act that the 'I' of the body usually wins over the weak, changing Personality, which capitulates without much of a struggle whenever it is a question of satisfy- ing the stomach or the sexual appetites. Justification is then sought in slogans such as those which allow us to think that it is normal to 'act like everyone else,' m in a maze of paradoxical reasons that are simply lies to oneself. But the inner conflicts of adamic man, who often enters esoteric work because he has reached the last extremity of moral bankruptcy, cannot be resolved by compromise, as there is 00 place for this kind of solution In the consciousness of the real 'I' from whichhe receives his calls. In him, it is the ensemble formed by the entire Personality, with the 'I' of the body, an ensemble which, directly or indirectly, is often made to act by the sexual centre, which flees from the voice of conscience, i.e. of the real '1'. He then has a choice, either to obey his real 'I9 and triumph over himself, or to flee from this invisible Combat into self-calming and the powerful illusions offered by a life of lying to himself. In every case, if he rriurnphs over himself, which is what wilI enable the adamjc man to resolve the inner conflict of the moment, this will inevitably involve a modification of his attitude towards outer life. Generally, the result will beconflict with those closest to him, unless the latter follow him step by step in his esoteric evolution, which is rare. This does not mean that those who are near and dear to him wish him any ill; on the contraty, it is nearly atways his good that they have in view: the conflict arises simply from their dj fferent cotrc+tions ~JtYhdt i~ real. If those who surround the individual in question are pse-adarnic, they could never agree with him, being incapable of understanding the reasons for his change of attitude and unable to grasp the nature of she ends he pursues. They will therefore automatically become instruments of the General Law, which makes sure that those who step out of Ijnc are brought back to the fold. This is how 'a man's foe^ shdIf be those US his own bo~sebo~d'\" Pre-adamic man, as we said, cannot be subject to inner or domestic conflicts of this kind. He rarely receives 'B' influences. If he vaguely senses their existence, they only appear as a cutjosity to his eyes and do not have the power to trouble him right to the depths of his psy- che. In him, the sexual centre reigns supreme, whether by its direct action that takes the form of carnal love, or by an indirect, *psychological', action of the psyche to which his Personality submits, Like adamic man's, his Personality contains the three lower centres, but that is all. Equally under- developed and unbalanced, but sheltered from the ttoubles provoked by 'B' influences, this Personality lives and acts obedient so the commands of the sexual centre. Nothing in him withstands the latter, which is known in contemporary language as t~mperamenf. In the arena of the 'exterior' life of human society, dominated by 'A' influences, the adamic man who has crossed the First Threshold proves to be weaker than his pre-adamic counterpart -just as good seeds sowed on ploughed land are weaker than tates; and the greatex the strength he acquires during his progress on the Staircase, the greater is his weakness when faced with life. This was the main reason why monasteries existed-so that the monks or nuns could be sheltered from 'exterior' life. But now greenhouse cuItiva- tion is outmoded; what is needed today is cultivation in the open air - entirely exposed to the elements. However, let the sincere, untiring and u~qdworker know that he will receive the means to protect himself against these storms. P re-adamic man does not reincarnate. Not having any jndividualized dement in himself, (in the esoteric sense), he is born and dies but he does not incarnate, and consequently he cannot reincarnate. He can be bylir orpycbc but notpneuntafic, since he does not have the Breath of Lijk in him, which is manifested in adamic man through the medium of his real '1: which can be realized or potential. The individualization of pre-adamics is collective, and is directed in groups by certain spirits of the hierarchy of which we have spoken above.\" This does not, however, prevent pre-adarnics from entering the evolutionary held that forms thejlms of adamics in great numbers, and as adamics suffer ftom a lack of discernmenr 17.

A s we have seen already, because of the Principle of Equilibrium, humanity on this earth is divided into two equal parts; adamics and pre-adamics. The equilibrium between them is autamatically adjusted to follow fluctuations of the incarnations of adamic souls. How- ever, if the adamic race, by casting its pearls to the swine, denies its divine nature to an inadmissible degree, this balance will be broken in favour of the tares. In the parable of the talents, Jesus foresaw the possibility of such a degeneration - where the slave buried the one talent entrusted to him, and, on returning it to his master without having made it multiply, was told: ' Tbon wicked and slo#bf.I struant ... and losfye the ~cn ro table ~twa#k i~fu 8\" awter drlrhesf: there sbaII be weepingmdgaashing oft~th.'' Is there my need to emphasize the esoteric meaning of this terrible penalty? We have seen that, when creation took place, the two humanities were placed under different authorities. Essefitially created, with organic Life on Earth, in the note LA of the second cosmic octave, pre-adamics come under the Absolute 111. Essentially created in the note SI of the same octave, and receiving the breath of the Y?, the mission of the adamics was to govern organic Life on behalf of the Absolute II, and under its direct authority. The fall necessitated a new beginning, and God provided for this through P~rguto~y, which is represented by the Staircase between the Two Thresholds. From then on, like the Man of the VIth day, subject to the law of birth and death, adamic Man appeared on the Earth beIow the First Threshold. He has kept a dim consciousness of the real 'I' in spite of the almost complete obstruction of his channel of eommunication with the higher Centres which still exist in him, and this still gives him the pos- sibility of a choice. If he hears the Voice offhe Mmter and resolutely steps onto the Staircase, and if he reaches the Fourth Step and resists the Trial by Fire, then, when he crosses the Second Threshold, he will be welcomed ns a prodigal SOR by the Absolute I1 himself. I f the adamics en mane abandon the combat that leads to Redemption, and if this desertion goes beyond the tolerance allowed, the good seed 19. Matthew xxv: 26; same as the Slavonic text. 134 codd be progressively stiffed by the tares, since for cosmic reasons the general potential of organic Life on Earth must be maintained in any circumstance. The world would then go straight toward catastrophe, which this time would take the form of a Deluge of Fire. On the other hand, if the equilibrium, which is already jeopardized, were reestablished, then, with the integral and simultaneous incarnation of adamic souls, the Time of transition would end and humanity would enter the Era of the Holy Spirit. Then would follow a thousand years consecrated to the perfecting of the two races, and after a second miIlennium, the reign of the Androgyne, the Last Judgment would definitively separate the tares from the good seed. The latter, by integrally regaining the note SI of the second cosmic octave, and now inspired by the breath of the Y* would then enter the bosom of the Lord to undertake a higher evolu- tion and at last attain the Pleroma. The tares of yesterday would cease to be tares. Promoted to the rank of good seed, they would begin the long evolutionary course that the adamics would have aIready covered. Then they in their turn would receive the higher centres of consciousness, which, given them in potential, would be the talents that they must make fruitful. W e must add that the adarnics who had previously degenerated into pre-adamics would have the possibility of taking up their aban- doned evolution again, while an equivalent number of the most able pre-adamics would receive the falends that were initially given to the for- mer, and this would help them leap forward on the road of esoteric evolution. They may be compared with gifted, hardworking students who get a double promotion while the incapable and lazy ones do another year in the same class. But in this case, one can faiI only once. W hen we consider this leap forward, it wouId be useful to meditate upon the parable of the gniuft~tervard;~ a clever man in the domain of the 54' influences, who knew how to find a new point of application for his cleverness, with good timing. However, apart from rare periods and rare exceptions, characterized by the direct intervention here below of higher forces coming from the Absolute 11, the faithful stewards of the Absolute I11 genemlly occupy an important position in the different groups and layen of human society. It would, nevertheless, be impossible to give any precise indications that 20. Luke xvi: 1-9."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"would enable adamics at the level of men 1,2 and 3, to objectively recog- nize pre-adamics, because the latter are also men 1,2 and 3, with the sole difference that they have no possibility of individual esoteric evolution. Thus, as long as the higher centres in adamic man remain in a lethargic state, he will be without the psychic instrument by whch he could objec- tively recognize his pre-adarnic counterpart, so that society remains mixed. Therefore it is only with the approach of the Era of the Holy Spirit, and 1 the appearance of the New Man, that the progressive formation of a new elite in all groups of human society will end the chaotic state, from the esoteric point of view, in which humanity has found itself since the fall of Adam. Meanwhile, the two races are totally mixed: not only nations, but even families can be, and generally are, composed of both human types. This state of things is the belated result of transgressing the Biblical prohibition against mixed marriages because of the beauty of the daughters of pre- 21 adamjcs. The dominant position of the pre-adamics that is a result of the esoteric failure of the adamics is now creating a critical situation of unpre- cedented gravity, The remainder of the Time of transition offers the last chance for humanity to reestablish the threatened equilibrium and so avoid a general cataclysm. If we do not take this opportunity, the tradition of 'Solomon' will finally wercorne the tradition of \"avid'--that is, it will overcome the Christian tradition in the planetary sense of this term. Then, deflected from the Absolute 11, and even going beyond the limits of what is necessary and useful in the mission of the Absolute I11 in the deification of the Personality, the fdse prophets and their followers, thinking that they are right, will hurl pre-adamic humanity - the chlldren of this world - against the adamics - the children of light - and will provoke a final frightful and useless struggIe. If this should happen, and if then, the new adamic elite does not manage to quell the revolt against the Love of the Absolute 11 and, paradoxicaIly, against the authority of the Absolute 111, a resistance that would ensure victory, the balance will finally be broken, and humanity will be destroyed in the Deluge of Fire. - 21.

We will recapitulate what was set out here and there in our earlier text, so as to sketch in the complete picture. The Book of Genesis, which teaches that pre-adamic man and woman were created, simultaneously but distinct, on the VIth Day, at the same time as the animals, does not give us any details abut the process used.' As fox the creation of Adam, this was after the WIth Day, the divine day of rest, thst is, when organic Life on Earth was already complete in its three notes, FA, SOL and LA? In this case the process is described. It is written: 'And the Lord God formed man of the dmt offbe gromd, and bredbed info hi$ no~tril~ the breath of Lijce; and man became a living sod.'3 Thus, whjle the creation of the two sexes of pre-adarnic humanity took place as a singIe stage, as with the animals, that of adamic humanity took place in two stages. Adam was created: 1) First, as a human being, in the proper use of the term, analogous to his pre-adamic predecessor, and like him, mortal, though of finer substance, 2) Then, as a living Soul, by the addition of the Breath of Life, of the divine essence thgt was introduced into hispgche, and through that into his we, which rendered him immortal. Readers of 'Gnosis' already know that at the second stage, Adam was endowed with the real 'I\", which was divine in nature, and the conscious- ness of which was established in him from that moment through the intermedia y of the higher emotional centre. He was given this in addition to the 'I' ef the body and the ephemeral 'I' of the Personality, whch also exist in pre-adamic man. We repeat: 'Before the fall, Adam had in hm three '1's: the 'I' of the body (hylic), the 'I' of the Personality (the psyche), and the real 'I' (pneumatic), whereas his counterpart of the VIth Day only had, and still only has, the first two: the 'I' of the body and the 'I' of the Personality. It is through the higher centres, the means of access to the real 'I' and to Consciousness, that Adam participated in the higher spiritual life: that of 1. Genesis i: 27. 2. Ibid., ii: 1-6; after the Slavonic text. 3. Ibid., ii: 7."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Paradise, the 'geometric place' of the divine consdousness, to which pre- adamic man had no access as he lacked the necessary means. F rom the Book of Genesis it is evident that, before the fall, Adam was dearly conscious of his real 'I,, which enabIed him to be in direct contact with God. On the other hand, he only had a rudimentary con- sciousness of the 7' of his Personality, which may be compared with contemporary cultured man's consciousness of the 'I' of his body when involved in his daily activities. In othct words, before the fall, Adam was cony711tnt witb God. From the moment that he betame confr~tnt witb his Person- aliry, the fall came about. Technically speaking, if Adam had played the sole initially assigned to him, he would have maintained the balance between the divine plane and the human plane by adhering to the androgynous race. Instead of that, when the Serpent ensnared Eve, and when she gave him the fruit of this ensnatement to taste, he went over to her side. That is when a magic sleep overcame him, and his descendants after him. Ever since then adamic man has taken for reality the dreams that the sleeping iittlc 3erpcnt? curled up in his sacrum, produce in him. This state, which is normal for all the species of organic Life on Earth incIuding the humanity of the VIth Day, is entirely abnormal for adamic man, who contains higher centres of consciousness within him. It is therefore necessary for him to awaken this littla Serpent to recover the consciousness of his Real 'I', for the most part forgotten and, even at the eleventh hour, to fulfil1 his true mission on this Earth, the one that the Lord God entrusted to him. A small jndicatjon in the Book of Genesis, which seems trivial and strange, shows us that, before the fall, Adam and Eve had a waking consciousness that was different from ours, for it tells us that they were not conscious of their nudity. They became censcious of it, and experienced a feeling of shame after the fall, that is, at the moment when, turning away from the consciousness of their real 'I', they identified themselves with their Personality. From then onwards, this tonstiou~nes~ of nudity, and the feeling of shame attached to it, have remained among the characteristics of their descen- dants. It is only recently- since the beginning of the twentieth century - that men, and especially women, either instinctively or for reasons which --- 4. Cf. Vol. 1, pp. 142; Vol. 11, 7, 91 (note), 92, 108, 110. 256. I have nothing to do with the approach of the Era ofTruth, seek to eliminate this kind of shame, which belongs to the corrupt state of fallen man, and contrasts vividly with the boundless moral effrontery of the 'civilized'. We may grasp the whole significance of this symbolic indication on shame and nudity if we consider it in relation to the words that Jesus used to define the spiritual condition of human beings who regain con- sciousness of the teal 'Iy, and through that, the fingdom of God. In his Sfratnata, Clement of Alexandria quotes a passage from the Gospel. accord- ing to the Egyptians, as follows: '. . . Wh Salome aed when the thing5 about which ~h asbd would be knowm, tht Lrd said: \" Whenyofi avodd bave trampled on th clotbing oj And in the Gospel according to St Thomas, we find the folIowing: \". .

It was a perfect but unconscious beatitude, in other words it was not realized intellectually. Incidentally, we must again emphasize the fact that because of the rneanjng of the Major Number VI, which is Rebirth, Renewal, and Reproductiotr, the man and woman of the VIth Day were entrusted with the mission of being fr11iq~l1 and m~If$lyiffg. AS long as Adam and Eve were in Paradise, they were exempt from this servitude: it was only after the fall that Eve con- ceived Cain, AbeE, and later, Seth. The organic unity of the androgynous consciousness, that is, of the real T which, being bipolar, is ONE for the couple, was subjectively disas- sociated in the Psyche of Adam and Eve at the very time that they became conscious of the u&ech'ie bipolarity of their respective Personalities wlth which they were identjfied -a bipolarity which faithfuIly reflects that of the created Universe, and the cause of Death. 5.

Logically, Adam's identification with the 'E' of his Personality must have produced a psy- chological fall in him first, and then a fall of the psyche. Further, it must have made him attribute a character of reality to the world of W inff uences and to his Personality, while his real 'I\", the divine gift he received as the Breath of Life, was relegated to the domain of probabilities or even of improbabilities or just pure fantasy. Because of this, for the fallen Adam as for the pre-adamics, the condi- tions of psychic and physical life became an end in themselves, instead of having in their eyes only the value of a merftls - a means of acting in Ithe domain of organic Life on Earth without confluence with it, to fill the role of regulator of the pulsation of organic life-a function of the needs of the First Cosmic Octave, and especially those of the interval between FA and MI of this Octave. the phenomenal or ephemeral world, it is impossible to lose the real. We can lose the feel of it, but even that can onIy be temporary; we can fotget it, but in the real sense of the word, the real cannot be lost. Thus, ever since the fall, the androgynous consciousness lives on in adamic man, although only in potential. In other words, as elements of the noumenal world, the higher centres of consciousness are always in full strength and continually act within him, but as he has diverted his attention from them and con- centrated on the three lower centres, he has no \"ears to hear' the divine Voice, which nevertheless ceaselessly transmits the Word to him. I B y taking the means for the end, adamic man endangered the natural evolution af organic Life on Earth, which had been conceived as a hierarchy starting from so-called inanimate matter, and ascending to the humanity of the VIth Day, the latter being guided by the humanity of the VLIIth Day, adamic humanity. We have seen that, in the notes LA, SOL and FA, organic life on Earth, including a pre-adamic humanity charged to 'be fr~irfl and rndfip!~' and subject to the law of birth and of death, was placed under the authority of the Absolute 111. In the original plan, however, it was destined to be governed by adamic humanity which, because it had hgher centres, came directly under the authority of the Absolute 11, and should have served as an orgartic link between the Third and Second Cosmic Octaves. If it had happened like this, the growth of our Ray of Creation and the development of the system of the corresponding cosmoses would have followcd a harmonious ascending curve. The fall of Adam and Eve, by causing a rupture in the chain of interdependence, caused a deviation in the onrush- ing current of Love proceeding from the Absolute I, infused on the way by the creative tenderness of the Absolute 11, and became an obstacle to the manifestation of this Love in an angelic (androgynous) form in the midst of terrestrial life. The androgynous consciousness -that of the real \"I' that is now rele- gated to the background of waking consciousness, (which we incorrectIy call clear consciousness), has nevertheless not been finally lost despite the fall; for if it is possible to lose the relative, which belongs to the 'A' world, T he last chance to reestablish the equilibrium - from DO up to RE inclusive - between the two directions of the current of Love whch vibrates all along she Great Octave of ow Ray of Creation, depends on the attitude of the adamic men and women who ad9 face the approach of the Era of the Holy Spirit. To exercise a salutary action, these men and women must exert themselves and make con~cious superhuman efforts aimed at reviving the androgynous consciousness of their real 'I' and, in so doing, at renewing the organic link that was intended between the Second and Third cosmic Octaves, which was broken by the Fall. It is important not to lose sight of the fact that there remains scarcely half a century in which to accumulate an energy that is quantitativeIy and qualitatively sufficient to restore the endangered equilibrium and harmony, The Time of Transition is already considerably advanced. The importance and urgency of individual and collec~ive esoteric work thus appears in all its fullness. Today, the method of research pursued in the silence of scientific laboratories or monastic cells- research that prr, gresses slowly, step by step, from one generation to the other-is out of date. To save humanity from the Deluge of Fire, we must in future have recourse to rapid means and direct our esoteric work to the very heart of our Mixt~s Orbis, which is in danger of being dcsttoycd. Now, by the nature of things, we must place all our hopes and confidence in the coupIe, the Knight and the Lady of his dreams. They alone, strong in their awakened androgynous consciousness, will be capable of creating a change of direction which, in the name oEJesus, will launch the Ark of our planet towards the fullness of the Era of the Holy Spirit. Then, and only then, the sacrifices of the One who was Beheaded and the One who was Crucified will be justified. I"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVII I t is important to remember that - except of course for adamic man - every creature taking part in organic Life on Earth, whether it has one centre to its psyche, two, or three as in man of the VIth day, has only one higher centre- the sexual centre. Indeed, on the hylic plane, the sexual centre is analogous to the higher emotional and higher intellectual centres, since it is by nature and structure doh, that is, jndivisibIe. Except when its energy is usurped by the three centres of the Personality, the sexual centre in its direct function, which is carnal love, has a goal that is well defined by the words: Be fruiy~i, ad nnluIdip4. In other words, in a healthy organism, this centte, like the higher emotional and inteIlectual centres, knows neither doubt, nor hesitation, nor sadness, wkiich is quite the opposite of what is too often the case with the three lower centres: it either participates in action, filling the psyche and the body with joy, or eke it is in repose, accumulating energy SI 12 in the morn $the blood,' which is the hlghest point of the transmutation of Hydrogens through the first octave of nutrition, This is the 'fuel' of carnal love. The reader may recall that, by filling the interval which separates 51 12 from DO 6, the carnal act causes resonance in the latter and so finds its raison d'ktre in the conception of a new being. However, if the Creator willed that all that made up organic Life on Earth should reproduce and multiply, this was not the mission of Adam and Eve before the fall, for, by virtue of its dual nature, adamic humanity was originally called on to serve as a link between the two planes. T he fa11 of Adam and the loss of consciousness of the real 'I' had the essential result that they led the adamics to a new, essentially logical attitude towatds the sexual centre. Adam, we have said, was initially intended to play a pivotal role bctweco the Second and Third cosmic Octaves, a role in which he was not intended to participate in human reproduction, but to preside over the evolution of all the creatures of organic Life on Earth, including the Man of the VIth Day. This was so that the fashioning of primitive types would pass through progres- sively foreseen changes along the ladder of general cosmic evolution. 1. Expression used by Aristotlt to specify sperm."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"N ow we must try to see what role the sexual centre would have had to play in adamic man if he had not fallen. This question has a practical aspect, as it touches the heart of every seeker who is engaged in esoteric work and whose goal is to return to the condition of adamic man before the falI, as well as taking up the negIected task and the rank he lost on the sale of cosmic evolution. J ust as Adam and Eve did not procreate before the fall, so, through their redemption, the androgynous couple of polar beings will be exempt from the servitude of reproduction. In thls instance, we simp17 refer to the texts quoted in the previous chapter. What then was the original role and use of sex in Adam and Eve, and what will it be in their descendants when the later, having brought abut the necessary rectification of the situation, have recovered their original dual nature in the image of Jesus Christ, when they wiII see the doors of the Covenant of Love opening in front of them, where, according to St Paul, the Son of God will be the Firstborn mong many ~rffhren? \" Above all, we must not think that redemption wiIl eliminate the sexuaI centre or the psychosomatic nature of adamic man. This is a point that must be underlined, as the human mind always has n penchant for extremes, and it has happened that an erroneous understanding and appli- cation of the theory of asceticism has pushed the faithful towards mutila- tion. This is how Origen, despite his lucid and enlightened mind, fell into the trap laid for him by the Absolute I11 and, sticking to the letter of the Gospel, castrated himself. This is how Eusebjus describes the incident: 'When Origen was working as catechist in AIexandria, he accomplished an action which is a very great proof of an inexperienced and juvenile heart, but one that was full of faith and temperance. He interpreted the following words of Jesus in a very simple, na'ive manner: \"And there be ~II~IIC~.~, which have made themselves es~nuch~fir the kingdom flbeaveds sake\",3 and thought that he was obeying the Saviour, and that, preaching divine things at a young age not only to men, but to women also, he would deprive the unfaithful of eve? pretext to shamefully slander him, by carrying out the Saviour's word.' 2. Romans viii: 29. 3. hiatthew xlx: 12. 4. Eusebius, op.cit., Book VI, ch. VII, 1, 2.4, A t the time of his Second Birth, man acquires a permanent conscious- ness of his real 'I', which is a monad of the Absolute 11. He reaches this through his higher emotional centre. Strong in this consciousness, he becomes capable on the one hand of progressively creating a link with his higher intellectual centre, which gives him access to the #rind of~hrifl,~ the consciousness of the Absolute I, and on another hand, of establishing his authority over the motor centre. Then the lower emotional centre, which has already been absorbed by the magnetic centre, but without losing its individual structure, takes its place within the higher emotional centre, a Thus man 5, thanks to the permanent consciousness of his real 'I,, benefits from a double current of Lwe -the Love from the Absolute TI, to which the Love from the Absolute I is graduaIly added, and whch pervades him through his higher centres.

The reader of 'Gnosis' must beep this example ever present in his mind as a terrible example of the determining influence that the general Law can exercise over the Personality. Origen, who came into the world with uncommonly rich and strong predispositions, and who was animated by an ardent faith, even so sadly fell into the trap that had been laid for him, and committed an irreparable error through a momentary Jack of discernment which made him confuse planes, the Letterwith the Spirit."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"authority of the Absolute 111, and because of this, from the domination of carnaI love. But the current of the latter, charged with SI 12, does not ccase to penetrate the 'I' of the body and the 'I' of the Personality. Here there is no motive for fear or scundd-on condition, natusaIIy, that one remains master of this energy and avoids the two extremes: the first, the ejection of SI 12 from the organism, can be remedied by appropriate exercises; the other, of which Origen gave an example, is irremediable. The current of carnal love whjch invades the body and the Psyche of man 5 is a beneficial phenomenon, appreciated and desired after the passage of the Second Threshold, for, from that moment, Hydrogen SI 12 serves as a raw material for 'manufacturing'. We have seen that the energy ST 12, diverted from its usual destination and surrounded by the SOL 12 and MI 12 acting as higher auxiliaries, formed the essential factor in the gencral transmutation. The DO 6 of the inner octave, or octave of redemption can, indeed, only be obtained starting from SI 12 for, in any case, the trans- mutation of the MT 12 stops at FA 6 and that of the SOL 12 at LA 6, the Hydrogens 6 are the finest that the human organism can produce or capture. Indeed, FA 6 and LA 6 are not capable of creating an innct octave, since this must necessarily begin with the note DO. DO 6 can only be obtained by a process oftransmutation that follows the first octave, that of nutrition - the only complete octave in the human organism - which starts from the DO 768 and arrives naturally at SI 12, whch, to be precise, is sexual energy. This is the real reason for the continence observed in monastic practice as well as in the courtly Love whjch unites the Knight with the Lady of his dreams. n order to give an idea of the technique of creation which ensured the 1 diversity of rhe species thar form the notes LA, SOL and FA of organic Life on Earth, we may mention that this diversity is due to the density of the Hydrogens which form thc scxual energy specific to particular species. Each type of Hydrogen contains a whole series of Hydrogens of the same type, just as, for example, the vitamin-type 'B' contains vitamins 81, B2, ... B12, etc. It is thus that, in a11 the diversity of the species thar are part of it, organic Life on Earth is fertilized by the sexual energies which, in the order of density of the Hydrogens, form an uninterrupted scale: SI 24 for a great part of the fauna, S1 48 for cereals, SI 96 for the perfumed flowers and plants, and so on. It is important to remember this, especialIy because of the modern tendency to treat certain jllnesses by introducing into the human organ- ism living sexuaI or other cells which have been drawn from animals, We can understand without much difficulty that it would be useless to expect the sexual hormone of a pig or of a sheep, which is comparable to human testosterone, to have a direct effect on the plane of SI 12 of the individual who is being treated, since the animal homne is Hydrogen SI 24. All that one can hope for wauld be a passing resonance on the plane of LA 24, giving a light shock to the ST 12- short, and of an impure resonance. To addition, the human organism defends itself against the intrusion of living cells, especially from lower organisms, for this intrusion draxvs nran tmvards Iwer JeveI~ so that he regrtx~es due to the fact that it constitutes a bestializa- tien of his body, which immediately has a repercussion on the Personality jn one form or another. Let us recall: the fine is always the cause; the coarse is only the conse- quence. Thus, starting from the sexual Hydrogen, which is always the 51 of the first scale of nutrition, it is easy to determine the basic Hydrogen which forms the food of the species being considered: for man, it would be Hydrogen 768, whereas for a dog it would be H 1536 in its most varied expressions. It is the same for the respiratory scale and the scale of impres- sions: the dog draws the coarsest elements from the air; the more refined enter its Iungs but pass out of them again without being assimilated; and as for impressions, it is obvious that the great mass of those which ate received by human kings escape the dog. This explains why, in spite of all the artistry he brought to it, Professor Voronoff's grafts produced only a temporary effect on the sexual plane, although sometimes they had unfortunate repercussions on other planes. We may go even further and say that the introduction of human ceIls in the organism, or in such and such organ or group or organs, could produce a durable curative effect only if the Hydrogens which govern the working of the organ or group of organs concerned were the same in the donor and in the patient-not only of the same type, like SI 12, for example, but of the same degree of this type, whjch would presuppose a psychosomatic ding- nosis taking into account the blood group of the two individuals, the degree of the development of their Personalities, and the specific nature of this development. We wilI close this digression here, leaving to specialists the task of drawing practical conclusions from the wider considerations developed below. I W e have seen that when the act of carnal love comes to a head at DO 6, the sign of conception, a new gamut-that of pregnancy -begins to I develop on condition that the orgasm communicates a willing impulse to"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"the spermatozoa - an impulse sufficient to impel them in search of the ovule until one of them manages to penetrate it. We also know that the gamut of pregnancy is necessarily n descending one. Thjs being so, the first intervaI to be filled is the one which separates the DO from the SI. This filling must take place during the lapse of time between the moment of ejaculation and the moment when the ovule is penetrated, and it demands, on both sides, high and complete harmony in the wilI of love; the grillof man and the will of the jesb.' This explains why, especially in human beings, pregnancy only occurs in a very small percentage of cases even though the roupIe may perform the act of carnal love many other rimes. The number of spermatozoa contained in every discharge of semen - half a million-and the enormous amount of those which are pouring out every month in the direction of the mule, lead one to think that through this abundance nature tried to multiply the chances of conception, which are generally very slim. This is why, at least for adamic humanity, a s~cc~s~ul pregnuney demands hatmony between the types of the father and the mother, as well as a sufliciently high tension of the will of love in both partners, so that ecstasy may atise - not only sensual, but emo- tional as well. For obvjous reasons, pregnancy is more frequent in contemporary pre- adamics. And, as the esoteric evolution of the adarnjcs presses on at an accelerated pace which is necessary for the successful ending of the Time of Transition - and there is a parallel diminution of births -pregnancy will take place more and more often among pre-adamics, so that the incarnation of the totality of souls attached to our planet may be assured. L et us come back to the process of inner transmutation of Hydrogens H 12 and H 6. This is produced by the series of phenomena whch the reader wiII find described in Chapter XIV of the present volume. En order to avoid any misjnterprctation of the postulates put forward in 'Gnosis', it is usefuI to emphasize once more that the psychosomatic technique of esoteric evolution depends essentially on the appropriate treatment of sexual energy. If the FA 96 does not give forth a pure, strong sound, the resonance of the SI 12 which it commands will be defective, and the student's esotetic evolution will be seriously handicapped. Sex and health, therefore, play the same kind of role in esoteric evoiution, and this is even greater than in reproduction. 9. John i: 13. We have seen the process of direct and lateral ttansmutation by which the opening of the higher emotional centre operates in man, and how the possibility of receiving its messages enables him to arrive at the conscious- ness ofthe real 'IP-a consciousness which is itself androgynous, that is, bi- polar. It is the passage of the Second ThreshoId which unites the Knight and the Lady of his dreams forever in a celestial marriage which crowns their first exploit. Having reached the bosom of the Absolute TI, and being One together and ONE with Christ, they experience at that moment the state which is defined by St Paul in the following words which we have quoted several times already: '. . . neither is the nlan witho~t the worn, neither the woman without the ma#, in the ~ord.''~ It wouId be vain to try to describe in human language the stages of esoteric evolution between the Second and Third Thresholds. Thc more the Knight and the Lady of his dreams, now androgyto~~ Initiates, progress along the stages MI and RE a€ the Way, the more completely they trample on the clothes of shame. Entrusted with missions corresponding to their strength, and allowed to contribute toward the building of the New Jer- usalem, they will build themselves at the same time. They wiII do this while they advance towards the Third Threshold, moved by the desire whch inspires an ardent love in them to reach the Door which leads to the Phroma, A useful indication may be given to the Faithful who unhesitatingly continue to climb the Staircase. This concerns the transmutation of the Hydrogens along the gamut of the innerprepany, starting ftom DO 6. As soon as the latter sounds, a powerful curtent of Love from the Absolute I invades the androgynous being of the Knight and his Lady and makes their pneumatic body tremble with joy, while their psychic bodies, filled with the love of the Absolute 11, overflow with an intimate and holy affection. Their physical bodies, putified and glorified, become capable of directly receiving the maternal tenderness of the Queen of Heaven. Then, with the Chdof Virjue, comes the consecration of the sublimation of sex, and the Absolute 111, in its aspect of Sathanael, comes to greet the Androgynous Conqueror. It is therefore cleat that the process of inner pregnancy, just like the physical pregnancy, follows a descending scale in which the salvation of 1 the Absolute Ill marks the Birth ofthe Andiounan-Man 8.

God, Son of Man, and Son of David. During His lifetime His Personality was already the object of lively contrwersies. The Gospel tells us that: '... there was n~~ch murmnrfng among the people ronc~rning Him: for some soid, He is agood man: otht'r~ snid, Nay: but he deceivefh thepeople.\" We do not know the outcome of these differences. Above all, we must not believe that this controversy has lost any of its force after all these enturies. Jesus is Alive, and earthly Time has no hold ! over Him. He remains eternaIIy present, and the controversy continues, even if it has taken new forms. By changing more and more in its form, it has taken n different shade but its contcnt has not changed with its appear- ance, and the opposition to Jesus continues as before. Students a5 the Doctrine should keep this fact in mind, or else they will be unlbEe to recognize the scando:! that multiply on the road which leads to the First Threshold, and which can be explained by the continual action of the I General Law. There are many formulae to lead one astray: some uphold 'liberty of opinion\" others demand 'proof' (sic) of the historical existence of Jesus; still others say that He existed, but that the true Saviour was John the Baptist, or even Simon ~a~us.~ The word Christic, which is in vogue now and replaces the word Christian in certain minds and in certain circles, bears witness to a greater ref ne- ment, It appears more cunciEiatory, more attractive even, but it is not so innocent as it appears at first sight, for, if we look closer, we may easily discern a subtle manoeuver that is intended to eliminate the Saviour by 'modernizing' Christianity. The name ChriJtim - which goes back to the first century, since the disci Ies first received it in Antjoch when Paul and Barnabas preached I: - there -1s not in any way ambiguous, while the adjective Christie has no proper definition: it is vague, elastic, and even as a neologism it lacks an academic definiti~n.~~ecause of this, it permits deviations that are easy but dangerous, and which can lead, if this verb can be used in ths context, 12.

A s for the doubt about the historical existence of Jesus, for centuries this has been paving the way for propaganda in favour of all sorts of philosophico-religious systems which claim to be initiatory, and which are Christian or rather Chrisric in appearance, that is, pseudo-Christian and 'independent'. The search for the Truth naturally began Iang before the Advent of Christ. It was pursued in different parts of the worId, including the Hel- lenistic perimeter which especially interests us, where it took difkrent forms. At the time of the Advent, certain cults were dying out: others, like the cult of Mithra, which some historians claim was a serious rival to the propagation of the Christian Doctrine, were at full Two great traditions attracted the attention of the Apostles: thc declining one of the chosen people, and one that was nurtured in the heart of the Greek nation which was called upon to be the cornerstor~e,%nd to bring forth the fraifroftbe ~itf~dorn.~ With a striking gift for synthesis, St Paul defined the two traditions in these terms: '. . . fhe Jew1 requim a ~ign, and the Greek seek afer wisdom':8 then, passing on to a hgher plane, he added: 'EM we preach Chrisf cx#c$ed, mto the Jew o stxmbling block, arid mto the ~reefoalishtess.'~ We can find the pre-Christian attitudes of the Jews and Greeks in our contemporary society which wishes for 'proof and demands 'freedom of thoughtJ.

The reader of \"Gnosis' will understand, without difficulty, that St Paul is referring to adamics and pre-adamics, the latter being the mighty, the noble, and the wise according to the wisdom of this world, for whom the crucifixion was, and stilI is, merely a myth, and who describe the Christian religion as the opim of the 9aop1e. Only the adamics, or, in St Paul\" terms, those who are 'called', can admit without a doubt that Jesus Christ, Son of God, Son of Man, and Sen of David, was crucified and resurrected from the dead, for they possess the higher centres of con- sciousness in latent form. Addressing the perJ~t,~ who were sczttered among the pre-adamics of that time, the Apostles, when preaching the Good News among the 'h' influences, strongly emphasized the absolute reality of the incarnation of the Word in the crucified and resurrected Jesus. In our days, a firm belief in the reality of this should be a definite sign for the seeker that he is on the right road, just as, for those who heed it, the preaching of this belief will be the sure sign that they hear the truth.

The first demands commitment; the second demands nothing: it proposes an absttact Christ, at the most legendary if not imaginary; a Christ who is in no way an obstacle to 'freedom of opinion', even where this includes the deification of the Absolute III and, at the same time, of the human Personality, bearing aloft the banner on which this misleading motto is inscribed: Liberty, Equality, ratern nit^.\" L et us now try to establish the facts. The first question that arises is the following: is Jesus an historicaI figure or a myth? As an historian, the author of 'Gnosis' is always deeply surprised by the prejudice that exists against evidence about the Saviour's life. We can constate a very marked difference between the way in which people treat other sources from which we get our knowledge of the ancient world and those which inform us about Jesusvtfe. Yet the scientific vaIuc of both sources is usualIy the same. It is very difficult to explain this phenomenon, but we can say that one reason is because, added to accounts of the 'normal', historically certain side of the Saviour's life, there are many other aspects that emphasize tt-e miraculous side of His passage on Earth. Because the Cartesian spirit, the basis of the Western science of yesterday, could not admit the truth of the miraculous, the ordinary events were also scen as open to doubt. In our days, however, science officiaIly recognizes the reality of cures just like these that make up the greater part of the mixacles performed by Jesus. This kind of miracle was known at all times, just as were other phenomena like clairvoyance, the partial disappearance OF gravity, levitation, etc. In addition, modern physics has opened up perspectives which are catcgori- caIly opposed to the Cartesian spirit, so that only yesterday they seemed to belong to the realm of pure fantasy, and the life and actions of Jesus appear in anew light to taday's scientists. The gap between traditional science and positive science is becoming narrower every day, and in this new light it is possible to reevaluate certain testimonies that were once well-known but were systematically set aside in years gone by. The mast significant is the one found in the Eccle~idsficul History of Eusebius of Czsarea, which is our 18. Boris hlotlravicff. LihrtC, Egnliki, Fmtcr~itiin Iy~tbi~cr. Brussels, 1957, No. 129. principal source of information on the early centuries of Christianity. This deals with the correspondence between Jesus and King Abgar the Black, a genuine historical character who reigned in Edessa in 7 BC, and then again, from 13 to 50 AD. This is what Eusebius tells us about him: '... King Abgar, who was reigning in a distinguished way over the nations beyond the Euphrates, was then consumed by a terrible physical illness that caused him acute pain and was known to be incurable, at Ieast by human methods. When he heatd the illustrious name of Jesus, and of the miracles the Iatter was performing, which were attested by all, he sent Him a letter asking Jesus to cure him of his disease. Jesus did not answer his calls by going to him, but honoured him with a personal letter prornis- ing him that He would send one of His disciples to cure Abgas of his illness and to save him and all his subjects. The promise to the King was fuIfilled shortly afterwards. In fact, after Jesus was resurrected from the dead and rose to heaven, Thomas, one of the twelve Apostles, by divine inspiration sent Thaddeus to Edessa. Thaddeus was one of the seventy disciples of Christ sent out as heralds and evangelists of Christ's doctrine. All the Lord's promises were accomplished through him: we have written proof of this in the archives of Edessa, which was the royal city in those days. This was found among the public documents of that country, which contain ancient records that go back to those of Abgar's time. It has been preserved there up to the present day. There is nothing like verifying the letters themselves, which we borrowed from the archives and translated literally from the Syriac as follows:' Copy of the letter written by the Toparch Abg~r to Jems, and sent to the btter in Jemsalem throu~h the mesJenger, Anania~. Abgar, son of Ushrnanas, Topatch, to the good Saviour Jesus appearing in Jerusalem, greetings: \"I have heard people talk OF you and your cures, which you perform without remedies or plants. From what they say, you make the blind see and the lame walk; you cleanse lepers; you drive away unclean spirits and demons; you cure those with long illnesses; you raise the dcad. Having heard all this about you, I have come to the conclusion that: either you are God, and having come down from heaven, you perform these wonders; or else you are the Son of God performing these wonders. This is why I wtite to you now and ask you to take the trouble to come to me and to cure the infirmity that I have. For I have also heard that the Jews murmur against you and wish to do you ill. My town is very small, but honourable, and it will suffice for both of us.\" 'This is the letter wdrten by Abgar, who was then partially enlightened by the divine light. It is interesting to read the letter that Jesus wrote, which was brought back to Abgar by the same messenger. It is, undoubt- edly, short, but it is full of meaning. Here is the text:"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Jes~s' reply, 5mt to the Toparch Abgur tbro~gb the messenger Anaaias. \"Blessed are you to have believed in me without having seen me.

As for what you write ta me, to come to you I must first accornptish here a11 that I have hen sent for, so thar after having accompfished all this, I may return to him who sent me. But when X have been lifted up, I will send you one of my disciples to cure you of your infirmity and give you life, to you and ta those who are with you.\" 'With these letters were the following texts in Syriac: 'After the ascension of Jesus, Judas, called Thomas, sent to Abgar the apostle Thaddeus, one of the seventy. On his arrival, the latter lodged with Tobias, son of Tobias. When they heard about him, certain people informed Abgar that an apostle of Jesus was there, just as He had promised. Thaddeus had therefore started to cure every illness and every depression by the power of God, so much so that everyone was astonished. And when Abgar learned about the wonders and the miracles that he was performing, and the cures that he was accomplishing, he thought that this must be he of whom Jesus had written: '\" ... When I have been lifted up, I will send you one of my disciples to cure you of your infirmity ...\" 'Abgar asked Thaddeus: Are you in tmth a disciple of Jesus, the Son of Gad, who told me: '7 will send you one of my disciples whowilI cure you and will give you life?\" Thaddeus said: As you have strongly believed in the one who has sent me, I have ken sent near you as you would have expected. And Abgar replied: I believed in him so much that I would have taken an army and destroyed the Jews who crucified him, if I had net been prevented by the Roman Empire. And Thaddeus said: Out Lord fulfilled the will of his Father, and after he had fulfilled it, he returned to the Wthet. Abgar said to him: And I also believed in him and in his Father. And Thaddeus said: Because of that I stretch my hand over you in his name. As soon as he did this, the king was cured of his sickness and the pains he endured. 'This is what we thought would not be useless or inopportune to report, and which we have translated literally from the ~~riac.\"' There is no doubt that, imbued with the Cartesian spirit, yesterday's men of science, who discredited the miracuIaus aspect of Jesus' work, have extended this attitude by discrediting even the positive evidence of this wotk. And about this discrediting, jt is surprising to note the ease with which phenomena that appear supernatural are accepted in Hatha Yoga, as we11 as in other eastern teachings which are more and more in vogue in Europe and America. 19.

R eferring to the testimony of Eusebius of Gsarea and Clement of Alexandria, we have already shown that the Gnosfs based on the Doctrine revealed in this wotk had been reveaIed by Jesus, after his resurrection, to the three Taborjtes, Peter, James and John, his favourite disciples, who transmitted it to their spiritual descendants. At first it was taught to the faithful in the heart of the early Churches, and then in the Didu~caliu, where teaching was free and the only limits were defined by the capacity of the students to assimilate it. During the persecutions of the thixd century it became 'clandestine'. From that time on, it spread as an underground movement, just like a stream of water that in this way avoids obstacles on the ground so that it can continue to flow until a suitable place allows it to reappear on the surface, as jt is doing today. Repeatedly we have said that Jesus' teachings, summarized in the Gospels, and those of the Apostles, which appear in the thirty-two books of the New Testament, were founded on this Gtlosis which, since then, has formed the object and the subject of the Holy Tradition. The attentive readex of 'GnoJs' would have observed that it provides the mind with a key that aIIorxls us to discover the triple meaning of the Holy Scriptures: narrative, symbolic, and hieroglyphic. It also permits the 'disaccultation' of the latter, conforming to the following words pronounced by Jesus: 'Unfoyo# it is given to how the mysteries of Ihe kingdom of God; bd unto them thaf ore witho~f all the things are dona in parables.'\" It is now time to subject the text of the Lord's Prayer-the Puter Nosfer- to a criticaI analysis made in the spirit of the study that is the object of the third part of the present volume. We must first consider it in the form in which it has reached us, and then, after reestablishing its original form, we must try to recognize the centtal point of the Saviour's teaching as it was bequeathed to the Faithful and to their posterity. In modern languages the Lord's Prayer appears in the following forms: 9. Our Father which att in Heaven, HalIowed be thy Name, 10. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven. 11. Give us this day our daily bread. 20. Mark iv: 11; from the SIavonic text."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"12. And forgive us our trespasses,zt as we forgive them that trespass against us. 13. And lmd us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. 22 Amen. In making a critical analysis of this text, we will follow the genera1 rule whch should be applied to every interpretation, to interpret it in relation to its context. Saint Augustine wanted passages from the Gospel to be annotated in rhis way, and he protested strongly against the bad faith of certain commen- tators who, he said, 'choose a few Isolated passages from the Scriptures, with which they can mislead the ignorant by not linking them to the statements that precede or faIlow them, and through which the author's will and line of thought can be understood,'23 We will therefore study the Lord's Prayer in the framework in which it appears, namely, in the context of the five verses which precede ie: 5. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they Iwe to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they mag be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6. Bur thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. 7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 8. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father kntlweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him. 9. After this manner therefore pray ye:24 and the twenty-one verses that follow contain a commentary on these verses, 5-9, and repeat the recommendations which appear in them. Ths is why the ekhth verse is repeated and widely cimrnented upon in verse 31 and the verses that follow: 31. Therefore take no thought, saying What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or Wherewitha1 shall we be clothed? 32. For after a11 these things do tbe Gtntiles st&: foryour heawn/y Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 21. The Bibliulversion is as follows: 'And forgive us our debtr, as we forgive out debtors.' But we have rcprcduccd the version that is cutrcntly used in the Churches, and by most English- speaking Christians. (Ed.) 22. Matthew vE: 9-13, Revised version of 1611 AD.

Take thexefme no thought for themorrm: for themoxxow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.25 It is obvious that, through these words, Christ was trying to turn the attention of human beings away from the 'necessfties~n which they were absorbed, and to inculcate in them a desire for a higher bread, for th one thing necesary. 26 I f we return to the text of the prayer quoted above, we will see that four of the five verses, including the request not to be led into temptation but to be delivered from evil,\" are related to divine things; thus, the prayer itself, and the whole of the VIth chapter of the Gospel according to St Matthew, seem to be dedicated to the principle of the importance of living on the noumenal plane rather than on rhe phenomenal. While they encou- rage man to concentrate his efforts on the application of this principle, they also promise hm eveytbing else, that is, the daily needs of life. These wiIt also be given to him if he respects this priority. Only one of the five verses is out of keeping with the four others and with the twenty-nine that complete chapter VI; this is verse eleven, which is as follows: 11. Give us this day ow daih breddVz8 This sounds strange when we see that Jesus twice said (verses 7 and 32) that this kind of prayer is the prayer of a pagan. We can therefore conclude that, in this form, verse 11 directly contra- dicts the prayer as a whok and its context, that is, chapter VI as a whole. The Slavonic and Greek texts do not contain this contradiction. In them, there is no question of doib bread, but of ru~rrubrfanfial brrdd2' - in other words, bmvenly bread, or bread dcscendcd from of which Jesus speaks so often. 25. Ibid.

This appears even more enigmatic when we consult the Vdgate and find in it the expression, 'Panem no~tr~m s~(#er~ubstan#ialem da nobi~ h~die,'~' which is correct. The original expression also appears in the first translations of the Gospel into modern languages. For instance, a French edition, published in Lyon by Nicholas Petit in the year 1540, contains a correct translation of the eleventh verse; it appears in the foIIow jng terms: ' Donne-nocu aniiourdby aostre pain super~~bsfantiel.'~~ Continuing our research, we came across another copy of the Gospel that appeared in the following century, at La Rochelle in 1616, where this formula had already become: 'Don~s- no^^ u~owd'hy tlostre pain qcotiditn.'33 The edition came out in a place and date that lead us to think that this innovation was due to the rationalism of the Huguenots-at that time, La Rochelle was their citadel. If this rationalization of the mystical formula, though erroneous, was logical for a Calvinistic spirit that was true to itself, we stiII fail to see how this Protestant version and certain variations of it found a place in the Catholic gospels that appeared in proper form under a Bishop's Imprimat~r.

No doubt the reader of 'Gnosis' wiU recognize the results of the action of the General Law, which is busy neutralizing those still active 'B' influences that represent a danger to a world where 'A' influences rule. I f we have taken the trouble to explain all these things that are almost self-evident, it is because the Lord's Prayer, the Parer Nosttr, is the core of the Doctrine, It is no exaggeration to say that there never has been, and never will be, on Earth, a prayer that surpasses or even equals it. This prayer expresses a yearning towards the Light and towards he, for God is both Light and Because of his identification with his Per- sonality, adamic man is submerged in blinding obscurity and, in fozmulat- ing this prayer, Jesus wanted to teach him to implore the aid of the warm Light of Love of which he had been deprived ever since the Fall. From tlvs didactic point of view, the five verses of the Prayer summarize the whole of the Gospeb and Epistles, which form a commentary on it. What is more, this prayer offers the adamic man a mystical means dworking his way up the stream of he emanating from the Absolute I, whch undergoes a considerable loss of pressure as it descends toward our planer. Tt follows from this that, on every rung of the Ray of Creation, life is a resultant specifically characterized by the conjugation of the vibrating Love of the Absolute I, whose action progressively weakens as it crosses the different planes of the Cosmos, with an inversely proportional quantity of feminine Love, the will of the flesh, the inert, passive love coming from the Queen of the Heavens. In pre-adamic man the proportion of these two eIernents is 25% and 75% respectively, while in Adam it was 50:50. By the Fall, adamic man broke this divine equilibrium, and, by delib- erately abandoning his light body, made of the 'dust of the earth', for a gross enveIope resembling that of pre-adamic man, he sank another step deeper into the Darke~x. The prayer that Jesus taught gives him a mar- velous instrument thanks to which he can strive to 'go upstream' and reestablish the broken balance of these forces. This prayer is built in what might be called transverse form. Attentive study will lead to the discovery of nine autonomous elements in the five verses of the Pafer Nosfer. These correspond to the notes of the Great Cosmic Octave: 34. 'Give us this day the brcad necessary for our subsistence.' 35.

The first group has a general character, with a preparatory role which is to clear the cluttered heart of the faithful so that the fine current of Love emanating from the Absolute I (the Father) can easily penetrate it. This operation is the first condition sine qua non for the effectiveness of the prayer. It is difficult to practice i~ the tumult of worId 'A', and it was to make it easier that Jesus made the following recommendation: '... when thou proyest, frrter into tby closet, and when thou hast shuf th_v door, pray to th_y Father wbicb ir in ~erret; uand thy Fajher which in secret shlJ reward bbss ope~b.'~~ 36. We have already establinhcd that the Fahr is the Holy Spirit; one prays here, thercforc, for the coming of the Era of the I-Ioly Sp~rit. 37. Thc Absolute 111. 38. Matthew oi: 6; identicml to the Slavonic text. One will notice that this text appears in versesix of Chapter SIX: a nurnbcr chosen twice, and which signifies the Rc~~rrcctipn. T he preparatory work mentioned above is necessary to isolate the heart from the hubbub of life, and to make it receptive to calm, inward contemplation. If this isolation is effective, the disciple can tackle the elements of the second group - the fifth and sixth - in an active and fearless 'mntxic' He will then solicit the intervention of the Abso- lute 11: the Christ; the supersubstantial bread by whose Grace he can obliterate his karmic burden, and by doing so can obtain his purification. Christ's attitude toward the supplicant who shows courage is invariably positive. He himself exercises constant pressure on the human heart, as the foIIowing words show: 'Behold, I $tat$ at the door, snd hock.'40 T hus, a possibility of purification is freely offered to him who, by following the transverse course of the prayer and, through chis, creating the desired atmosphere within himself, first by passive concen- tration then through active concentration, knows how to implore this cleansing through Grace which is the supersubstantial bread of the Christ. This is offered to him 'today', that is, in this very life. All the conditions required far effective prayer are thus brought together. Yet these necesrar_v conditions are not sufl~ient: a second sine quo aon condition remains to be fulfilled. This demands of the human will the effort to anticipate the divine will, which is aIways ready to help the man who aspires to Redemption. This condition is defined in the seventh element of the prayet: '.. . As we forgive them that frespasr agaimt w.' Through this hman act, whch is divinely inspired, the faithful fills the interval that separates the notes FA and MI and, in this way, opens the 'sluice gate' for the current of Christ's redeeming Love, which flows here to join that of the Father. It is easy to imagine the importance of this act, on which the crossing of this interval depends. If this second condition sine qua nun is effectively fulfilled, the faithful can pass to the fourth group of elements, and it is then that he wiIl pray usefully, in the note MI, to be preserved from another fa11 even worse than the first, and, in the note RE, to be forever delivered from the yoke of the Absolute 111. This is the first of the hieroglyphic meanings of the Lord's prayer, which is the pillar of the Doctrine centered around the problem of individuaI 39.

But there remain two others: the reader of 'Gaosis' who has reached this point of our detailed study must first discover the second, then the third. He must try to do this by studying the indications given earlier with the schemata diagramming the universal cosmogony, especially the system of the Three cosmic Octaves. This discovery demands a great emotional assimilation of the Doctrine. The only way this is possible is by individual revelation, and knowledge acquired in this way cannot be transmitted in human language. Whoever - man, woman or child - manages to have a vision of the architecture of the PaterNoster, immediately enters, if only for a split second, into direct contact with the plane of the divine Gnosis, We must then apply all his strength to keep alive in his memory the impressions he felt during this instantaneous revelation. .. T he only thing that remains to us now, for this chapter, is to consider the miraculous side of Jesus' work. We will begin with the Nativity as the Gospel describes It. It is known that Eastern Orthodoxy does not accept the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. This theory, which was upheld by the Franciscans and opposed by the Dominicans, was presented before the Catholic Council of Basel (14311, which decided to recognize it as part of the doctrine of the Roman Church, but it was mly in 1854 that Pope Pius IX declared, ex cathedra, in the Bull Itleffebilis Deus, that the Itnmac~lutt Conception was a dogma whose acceptance was obligatory for every Catholic. According to this dogma, from the moment of hex conception by Saint Anne, the Virgin Mary was protected from every trace of original sin. To the Eastern mind, this theory seems contrary to the very meaning that the Western theologians wished to give it. Apart from the fact that the Ortho- dox Church does not recognize any dogmatic evolution after the VIIth CounciI, which had a truly oecurnenical character, to qualify the conception of the Mother of God as immatuIate does not appear to the Orientals so much as an attack on the High Fact of the incarnation of the Word as Son of God, but more on his nature as the Son of Man. Far them, this damage has a monophysite implication, since it takes away from the bnma~ nature of Jesus its b~arunig in the strict sense of the word. What is more, since the CathoIic dogma regards the Saviour as born of the Father, who is the Holy Spirit, and of the Mother, mjraculousIy presetved from any trace of ori- ginal sin, one could maintain that, if the nature ofjesus, as the Son of Man, was not reaIIy human, terrestrial, and integrally inherited from his Mother, His sacrifice and Passion have no intrinsic value. Orthodox dogma recog- nizes a dual nature in Jesus: divine and human, in which each of the two elements has its full reality and strength. The Virgin Mary was pure, chaste, and innocent, but wholly terrestrial and adamic; she conceived Jesus by the Holy Spirit, and therefore without the intervention of man, by the grace of an immaculate conception, but this sinless concep- tion was that of her Son and not of herself. Briefly, the Orthodox belief is that the divine intervention in a genuinely terrestrial feminine body is precisely what makes the greatness of the birth and passion of Jesus. Not only this but, with the current progress of science, parthenogenesis has now Iost the nature of absolute unbelieva- bility it had before. Tarnorrow, sceptics will no longer claim that the story of the Gospel is 'impassible' with the ignorant certainty which they pos- sessed yesterday. Let us suppose that, his scepticism silenced, man finally admits the greatness of Jesus' work, it would still have to be explained how His passion was in fact able to save humanity. We might say that Jesus was neither rhe first nor the last innocent man to be executed, and that judicial errors and abuses of power are as old as the world. This reasoning, however, is faIse because it is incomplete. The fact is that Jesus was not only innocent, but without sin. Let us try to analyse this fact in mathematical form by representing it in an equation: Let us say that the aggregate value, physical and moral, of the average earthly mzn is equal to x, that the sum of his faults, again physical and moral, is equal to y, that his karmic burden is equal to z, and that all three elements are variable. In this case, the value of the ratio: X - .... * .....,...,... Y+Z (1) wouId show the remainder of man\" general balance-sheet drawn up at a given moment. Now, every human being is born with a certain reserve of vitality and with a particular karmic burden, so that: x > (y + 2). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (11) During the course of life, this ratio is modified. Genetally, y and z increase, whereas aftcr a certain time, x dccreascs. Howcvcr, as long as the ratio (I) remains positive, that js, as long as:"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"the man remains alive and is capable ofpraducing, that is to say, of using as physkal moral or spiritual strength, the excess of x - (y + z) for ends pursued on the corresponding planes. When, because of age or fatigue, the formula (111) takes the form of the following equation: the man lives like a business operating with neither a profit nor a loss. When, later in life, this ratio continues to be modified in the same direction until it looks like this: x < (Y + 4 or the 'n' being an infinitesimal that has zero for its limit; and when this limit is rcached, and our formula becomes: X -- - 0 Y+X then the man dies. If we now take the case of Jesus, we will see that bur equation takes quite a different and even unique aspect. In Jesus, by definition: x was a constant of his perfectly deveIoped Personality and body; y was equal to zero; z was aIso equal to zero. E~sn xvithour comidering the skeizgtb ofhis divim mf~re, the human equation is as follows: This means that the voluntary sacrifice of the Son of Man, He who was without fault or sin, and without theliability of a karmic burden, released a moral and physicaI force of unlimifed greatness. During the twelve millennia between the fall of Adam and the Advent of Christ, the general karmic burden of organic Life on Earth had become so great that the Tfit~cosr/los was threatened with disintegration, since the accumulation of hate, jealousy and violence was too great for the new Commandment: 'LOVE one another.' And the call to adopt the ultimate saving attitude: Laveyow enemies, could no longer be understood nor even heard. Since it had become impossible, because of this, to save the 'k' influence world by an inflow of the 'B' Influence of divine Love, there only remained the formidable substitution formula: to achieve this salvation through suffering '. . .

CHAPTER XIX B efore the Earth can enter the Era of the Holy Spirit, the Time of Transition must reach a successful outcome, and this outcome will in turn depend on a positive answer to a whole group of problems which will be solved by the appearance of the New Man. We have already studied these probIems from different points of view: now let us tty to consider them all together. This will give us an oppor- tunity to observe the behaviour of certain elements on different planes; elements which play a role in humanity as a whole and should in principle make an active contribution to the positive evolution of mankind. The better to grasp a11 the problems that interest us, because they ate in a certain measure autonomous, it is useful to examine their elements one by one. The positive and synchronous development of these will contribute to a satisfactory outcome of the Time of transition, and then to the estab- lishment on Earth of the Era of the Holy Spirit. From this point of view, we can distinguish four principal elements in human society: 1. The popuIafion of Earth, which today has over 3,200,000,000~inha- bitants. The annual percentage growth, according to UN publications, is 1.3%, which should make it reach abut 7,000,000,000 people by the end of the century. 2. Tbe ruhg elite of the world, those in different countries who hold the reins of command on political, economic and social planes, and which, by the force of events, begin to be penetrated by the planetary consciousness. 3. The farnib, the reproductive cell of the body of humanity. 4. The cowpie, androgynous or not. At every level, this is the fundamental unit of humanity. We are going to consider this whole group of problems that concern us by visualizing them in action, that is, by observjng their evoEution in the past and then extrapolating it into the future. We know already that the only motive strong enough to make living beings rise out of their somnolence is Lwe, pure or mixed, in all the ways it acts-positive or negative. In the Iight of the manifestation of this creative and at the same time perturbing force, we are logically brought to study the four elements-mentioned above-at different levels. This will Pead to a final synthesis, from which we will draw some general conclusions."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"W e know that man can reach the consciousness of his real 'I' by working on his under-developed and unbalanced Personality. The same kind of work can also act in the opposite direction, enabling him to beautify his body. It is important to understand how this can be done in practice, since the improvement of the human race, which is the object of our study, depends on this pssibility. We will therefore discuss it briefly. The real 'I', the Monad of Christ, is so beautiful that it defies all descrip- tion. When the human Personality, which is dull by nature, becomes an Individuality by uniting with the real 'I', it begics to shine with the light communicated to it by the latter, and it then transmits the beauty it has gained to the physical body. This, in a few words, is the process of imptov- ing the human race, and it can lead to what Tradition calls rhtgIorificution of the b04.' Is there any need to say that we are still far from this? For the moment, let us see what modern man can do to move towards this goal. T o sum up, we can say that in order to become an Individuality, that is, in order to identify itself with the real 'I,, the Personality should already have acquired a minimum degree of beauty; and the hylic body should be prepared for the establishment within it of the Individuality that is born of this union. In order to give our bodies this indispensable mini- mum of beauty, we must work on our Personality, for we know what an influence the psychic exercises over the physical; and we must do this without further delay, as very little time remains. Man has an instinctive feeling which pushes him in this direction, only he confuses the idea of being with that of appearing, so that, while exerting himself on the plane of appearance, he makes no deliberate effort on the plane of being, not daring to believe that it may be possible to obtain tangible results in this, so much is he the slave. of his scepticism. This is why, in spite of hs ingenuity, imagination, and energy, there are no lasting results, and hardly any contribution is made to the improvement of the race. 'Chis is because these efforts are applied rightly in detail, where their aim is to aid nature, but are badly conceived in terms of the essential, where they too often run counter to the divine callby substituting fantastic 7. Vd. II, pp. 23S240. stylization for the culture of true and heaIthy beauty. Indeed, the ptoblem in the improvemcnt af the human race, both adamic and pre-adamic, is precisely that of the cultivation of beauty: physical beauty and beauty of psyche, whch are closely interdependent. Everybody generally agrees that, in animated and visuaI form, the high- est expression of divine Beauty on Earth is the human body, especially that of woman, for nothing can equal the harmony of perfect feminine forms. The male form cannot equal it, as we can see in even the most beautiful masculine forms left us by ancient Greek art: those of Apollo and Nar- cissus, which have never been surpassed but which are nevertheless effeminate. This is normal. It is a question of balance in the polarity of the sexes: Woman\" strength lies in her beauty, whereas Man's beauty lies in his strength. A b~autiful mother who gives birth tn heautiful children: this is the natural and feasible way in which we can improve the human race. If we leave aside the spiritual, pneumatic factor, which is not within every- body's reach, we can say that the solution of the problem we are examining here demands a synergy of properly oriented, conscious efforts, psychic and physical. Later, we will talk more fully about these psychic efforts, but here we wilI confine ourselves to saying only what is necessary about the participation of the motor centre in this aspect of culture. I t is no exaggeration to say that the question of pure physical beauty, which occupied an Important place in ancient Greece, was latet gra- duaIIy relegated to the background until it was finaIly lost in the recesses of human consciousness. There is no doubt that for ancient peoples, espe- cially the Greeks, physical beauty was of burning topical interest: we need no better proof than the penalty to which the civic oath of the Chersonese condemned traitors and perjurers, namely: No Juttger to ham bea~~tifuI (Ail- I dm. The desire to imprt divine beauty to the human body made the Greeks give birth to an artistic expression whose proof to this day is in their unparalleled marble statues. Of course attempts were also made elsewhere, and Egyptian, Greco-Buddhic, medieval Christian and Renais- sance art - to name only a fewS - give us admirable exarnpIes; bur these marveIs are different from the Greek modeIs because of their stylization, 5. We do not mention ancient Rome here. Except lorprfraitm, at which they were past masters, the Roman artists remained pupils of the Creeks."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"which happened because the intellect intervened, imposing its own 'con- Jdcrations' onto the realism of pure Art. The realism of Greek art, which created such beautiful images of the human body, with such a perfect knowledge of its harmony and its anatomy, has never been surpassed or even equalIed. We must consider these images as proofs of a divine revelation of a very high degree, which placed those artists who were blessed with it on the same leveI as the prophets. Works like this, made by the hands of tpopte~: such as Praxiteles, Phidias and other grcat masters, will forever remain the objects of study and admiration. The divine nature of these revelations may also be recognized by the fact that these ancient Greek masters generally represented perfect human beauty in the form of nude or semi-nude bodies. This nudity did not shock them, neither did jt offend those who contcrnptated these master- pieces later, whether they were men or women, initiates or non-initiates, for they were all impregnated with the very high religious spirit that reigned at the time. To be ashamed of nudity is a logical consequence of the Fall. It is a result of comparing the ugIincss that has ken acquired with the beauty that has been lost because of it. This shame was effaced before the classical nudjty of the marble gods and goddesses, which were Images of divine perfection and, as such, were objects of chaste contemplation and sacred veneration. These nude bodies were very real expressions of perfect Beauty, and thus of the divine essence, and this meant that they were free of the stylization which comes from intellectual interference. The divine purity of masculine and feminine dorms really depicts adamic humanity before the Fall. It presents us with the original types and sub- types of sinless men and women, without vices and without karmic bur- den. From this point of view, the pantheon of Greek gods and goddesses gives each of us a practical means of recognizing our original type or subtype and thus discovering our own physical deformation and, through this, learning the nature of our psychic deformation. The attentive study and regular contemplation of these images, expased in the temples and on the public squares of Greece, explains to a great extent what is called the 'Greek miracle.' And if people in our cities today could admire the statues of the gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon, perhaps it would be easier for thew to understand the oracle of the Pythia of Delphi which Socrates transmitted to posterity, but which is so little understood in its true sense; 9. Initiates m the Mystede. 10. Know thyself, External contemplation of this kind, accompanied by simultaneous introspection (constatation), and pursued in a spirit that we might properly call religious, would be a powerful factor jn the improvement of the human race which is the object of our study. And the higher the degree of contemplation, the greater\" the influence of this factor. W e must make it clear that we are not advocating naturism or nudism. It is obvious that to constantIy look at imperfect, flabby bodies could only augment the ugliness of future generations. But if it is true that the majority of human beings have imperfect bodies, it is still possible to favour the regeneration of the human race, and we are going to propose at least one way in which this can be done. 'One nail drives out another,' they say. It is this that we are suggesting, but the nail we insert must be up to standard! We are, indeed, spectators of a terrifying show which is a result of the deformation of our degenerated mind: the pathological taste which is spreading through the Arts, and which deforms faces and bodies until they become monstrosities which are a veritabIe offence to God and a blasphemy against the Holy spirit.\" Not only do we come to terms with ugliness, but we even admire it as long as it is 'in style'. The general quest is not towards the Beailfq~~Iand the Twe, but towards the New at any cost, so great is our fmr of being left behind! In ancient times, was it not this frantic search for the 'sensational' that urged Erostrates to burn the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the world.I3 What else could replace this enormous nail? The framework of the present chapter does not allow us to examine in great detail the effects of this illness of the psyche from which our civilization suffers; we must limit ourselves to consider one aspect of the vast question which is at the centxe of our interest: that of feminine beauty. We will try to show that women's clothing, conceived in an appropriate manner, could play a significant role in (salving) the problem of the improvement of the human race. This faces us with a new principle which is at first sight paradoxicak if it is not possible to rely on obtaining this improvement by means of indi- vidua1 beauty, which is rare and never cornpIetc, then could this not be 11.

This question undoubtedly deserves the attention of the masters of couture. W e wiII digress here to make it clear that, because chromosomes and their genes are perpetuated, ggliness never completely supplants beauty in the human body. The proportion of beauty and ugliness which are the lot of every newborn person are the expression of the integral content of that human being, who comes into the world with a certain total of physical and psychic predispositions and also with a karmic tare. In each case this proportion is strictly determined by the PrjncjpIe of Equili- brium as it applies to human nature, so that it is possible for hewho howshow to judge, according to the observed deformations of its beginning, the original value of any Personality. L et us close this thought without taking it any further, and return to the question of what could be asked from artists and fashion-designers. For the latter, haute-couture and its ready-to-wear imitations, designs shouId be created not only appropriate to the situations the designers have in view: for daily activity in office or store, travel by car, sports, socializing, celebrations etc., but also, above alI, based on the different partial expressions of feminine physical beauty. If we leave out particular cases, we can say that the proportion of beauty that is retained by the feminine body is in general from 25% to 50%, it is rare that it reaches 75%. In no case does it reach 100%. Thus it is a question of increasing the percentage of beauty and reducing the proportion of ugliness. The beauty which enters the feminine body has a limited number of expressions: beautiful shoulders, beautiful arms, beautiful legs, beautiful feet, pretty neck, lovely hands, pretty throat, pretty waist, etc. If what is ugly is cleverly hidden, the distinctive elements of each human type can be made prominent, together forming an inttgral exprer~io~ of the sought after femi~ifle beawty, no longer expressed in marble, but in fi esh and bone. The realization of this objective would naturally require the creation, for each category of dothing, of a whoIe serjes of designs carefully studied for the precise aim of revealing the case types ofpartial beawby. The spectacle of the collective beauty of women and girls thus dressed, to which each would bring her part of the divine heritage, clan only be imagined, so that in this way clothing would again find its authentic aesthetic roIe, which is precisely to emphasize the femininity of the weak sex. We can only suspect that over time the impressions produced on preg- nant women by the collective beauty thus offered to their eyes would have an effect on heir childten which would spread the artistic effort that we have just described. L et us repeat, so as to clarify our thought, that women's clothing, studied from this angle, should be conceived in a manner correspond- ing to each case type of partial manifestation of the perfect Beauty in the imperfect human body. It is thus - a second paradox - that 'appearance' put to the service of 'being' couId effectively contribute to the general enhancement of the beauty of the human species, and that in the excep- tional circumstances of the Time of Transition, the art of dressing women would take on the chiacrer of an esoteric mission. However, in the accompIishment of this mission, which requires a synergy of science and talent, the artists and designers of women's cloth- ing should not lose sight of what should be emphasized, and not con- cealed,feminini~. This is a constant aesthetic imperative, which, morewer, the national costumes ofaU peoples have obeyed throughout the centuries. In the general framework of a new Fashion, whose characteristic would be precisely - divine reflection - the issue today is to create a mi0 of fern- ininity in the wried interpretation of types. One could object that if, in applying the proposed method with the design of putting partial beauty into evidence, we would achieve a total exposure of the integral beauty of the feminine body, it would have to be the same for faces, of which nodung could be hidden. That is true, but the beauty of the face and beauty of the body arise from different pIanes: whereas the body is the principal expression of the divine beauty on the physical plane, the face essentially reflects the interior content of the individual. The beauty of the body is afirmed by the beauty of its members, by the harmony of proportions and lines, all things whch are exterior, while the face is the expression of interior things. And when the psychc and spiritual content of an individual is really beautiful, this kauty is translated by the captivating charm which emanates from the face."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"I f we now pass from the dressing of the body, which has an ornamental function, we will ascertain that the care of the body has been the object of a growing attention since the beginning of this century. Much has already been done in this respect, particularly for women, and a healthy and fit body, with muscles that are well developed through physical exer- cise, is today the ideal of every woman and every girl. This tendency, as long as it does not go beyond moderation, is healthy and even excellent: swimming, horsemanship, mountainclimbing and the exercises of classic dance, for example, whose practice is more and more widespread, are among the best means at our disposal to contribute to the harmonious improvement of the race. A 11 this concerns the exterior care of the body, using methods whose beneficial effects join with the progress that hygiene has realized in the whole world, and whch, already, have increased the expectancy of lih at birth and favoured longevity. These two factors, by augmenting the chances of procreation on the one hand and diminishing infant mortality on the other, act toward the incarnation of the totality of souls attached to our planet, a condition which must be fulfilled at the time of the coming of the Era of the Holy Spirit, About the internal care of the body we must admit that, except for surgery, this still leaves much to be desired. Yet outer and inner care sheuId go hand jn hand to produce the maximum tesult, whch leads US to mention two vast domains which are closely related: those of diet and medicine. The problem of diet has a dual aspect: the production of foodstuffs, and rational choice from amongst them to meet the needs of nutrition. The progress of the chemical industty in the manufacture of fertilizers, as well as the mechanization of agriculture, have led to very great results. Yet it is generally agreed that, while they have improved in quantity and even in appearance, the products of that agriculture have lost a great deal in terms of quality. What is more, most ofthe time we drink water which has to pass through filter stations before it becomes drinkable, and we breathe air which is mare and more polluted by the emanations of all kinds of factories and vehicles, to say nothing oFatomic tests. The problem that this state of affairs poses is beyond solution not only on the individual and collective planes, but even on that of the State: indeed, this is one of the most pressing international problems. I n this Iight, the creation of the INTERNATIONAL HIPPQCRATEC FOUNDATION on the Island of Kos, in Greece, is of ecumenical dg- nificance, and the message addressed to the Crown prince of Greece (now King Constantine 11'3 in the name of the Goddess Hygieia, appears moving.

Woman's entry into the arena of public life is not deplorable in itself: on the contrary, we can only k glad that this tendency is now well-rooted in the cuItured classes of all peoples, who recognize the young woman's right to try and affirm herself like any young man. However, we must be careful not to adopt extreme attitudes, even if they are understandable on the morrow of the victory won by women in the bitter struggle that they have had to wage to win the right of free determination, as well as their place and their new role in human society. The main danger for women, and above all for young girls, lies in the frequently observed attitude of copyrng men, for then woman loses all the specific assets that give her her charm, so that she betrays her mission without any reason or benefit. By this, we mean that if woman helps man according to the precepts of the Book of ~~ne~if,'~ and even if she repEaces him, she does not lose her specific qualities, but this loss is jnevi- table from the moment she forces herself to be irk a man instead of being polar to him. In the following chapters we will come back to this question which is of paramount importance. In the meantime, let us end by an illustration which expresses the depth of our thought: let us try to imagine a child who, through one of Nature's caprices, is born with a left arm ending in a right hand1 Can we think, even for a moment, that this malformation will not have an effect on the whole life of this unfortunate child? It is the same for young girls who cultivate a masculine spirit in a feminine body: by deforming themselves psychically, they also lose their charm, so that they fall into the ranks of a third, psycho-pat holagical sex: the s~ztfer Sex. If it is not stopped in time, this tendency to copy the other sex- which can be found in men as well as in women - excludes both from any possibility of esoteric16 evolution! 15. Genesis ii: 18, 19. 16. 1 Corinthians vi: 10. CHAPTER XX r T o study the esoteric meaning and mission of the Family during the I Time of transition, we must first give a definition. When we refer to the family, we mean the group consisting of a couple and their children, excluding all the paternal and maternal relations. We do not class couples without children in this category, but will dedicate later chapters to them. P rofiting from scientific discoveries and technical progress whose scope increases every day, man improves the material side of his life more and more, while he neglects the psychic and spiritual sides to a surprising degree. It would be difficult to claim that the magnificent efforts he has made in the exploration of nature have led to a general reassessment of moral values, or to a xefotmation of our scale of values. Because this has not happened, against all reason the old and now obsolete scale of values continues to influence our behaviour. This means that the progress of positive science only acts on the material elements of life and has no influence wer its essential parts. Ths in turn means that, underneath, the human condition remains to all intents the same. Men are born and die today as they did in the past, and they continue to be subject to incurable diseases of body and psyche, The increasing numbers of those who do not fit into the new ways of life has led to delinquency of unpre- cedented proportions, not to mention the widespread use of drugs, whch leads to moral suicide. Finally, in the most economically advanced coun- tries, the pace at which all means of transport ate developing results in so many fatal accidents that we sometimes wonder if Nature is not taking revenge on us for the destruction of its wild animals. In short, in spite of a11 the conquests that man has made through the development of his intelligence, he has not become fundamentally hap- pier. Hc tries hard to convince himself to the contrary, but this is a sign of his weakness. In his heart of hearts, he knows perfectly well that he is mistaken. In addition, does not Cartesian wisdom itself teach him that happiness is onIy illusory; chat it only lasts as long as the illusion lasts?"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"T hough man is willing to exhaust himself in feverish activity-not to mention the compromises, so debilitating to the psyche, to which he lends himself- to secure a job, build up a fortune, and to satisfy his self- lwe and especiaIIy his vanity, he would straightway reject as false the idea that the conquest of happiness demands methodical efforts - a struggle even harder than that for material wealth. He simply believes that happi- ness is his due, and then, paradoxically, he just waits for it to come to him, ready-made, from the worId of !A' influences. And as this world begins from the relative Zero, it is an illuso ryworld, in which Life is characterized by an exhausting instability which makes it a very rough sea!' Is it not unreasonable to hope that perfect and lasting happiness can comc to us from such* world? Yet man becomes indignant-or he cries in the silence of the night - when he sees that he cannot realize ths hope. T he reader of 'Gnosis' will notice the illogical nature of this attitude. He knows that without the practice of esoteric work, which demands an almost permanent state of introspection and presence in oneself, as well as uninterrupted conscious efforts, man passes his Iife in a continual state of mekbanicui conjuence varying in degree between x% and loo%, the absdute so-called 'normal' value of 'x' being at least 75%. In these conditions, it is correct and realistic to say that happiness lasts only while the illusion lasts. T his is because man Iives without a goal, or, more precisely, without a goal that transcends the domain of 'A' influences. Instinctively, how- ever, he aspires to true and permanent happiness, but instead of applying all the strength of his soul to conquer this, he wastes jt running after the will-o-the-wisps that pleasure makes shine before his eyes. He dreams of pure gold, but he is satisfied with tinsel like the great child that he is. Real happiness is inaccessible to him because its conception is beyond the mental horizon of a being whose spirit is oriented in this way. Even when, animated by the best intentions in the world, man resolutely tries to create a happy home and hearth and to realize a satisfying life, he never entirely succeeds; but then, how could he when, in worId \"A, nothing lasts, everything breaks, and everything tires ... 1. Vd. I, p. 32. The conditions of life in Russia a hundred and fifty years ago inspired the writer Fushkin with a formula for the maximum happiness possible in such 1 a world. At that epoch, on the lands of the squires, life flowed on with no complication. Every evening, on going to bed, one made the sign of the cross and said: 'Yet another day has gone by: God be praised Who has made it so!' It is in this sleepy atmosphere, where hearts beat slowly, that Pushkin makes a faithful old servant say: 'Habit is given us from on high to take the place of real happiness ...'2 This sovereignty of habit supported by religion gave a great stability to the families of peasants and squires alike: from generation to generation, she former provided the latter with servants and nursemaids who became real members of their families. Everything followed its daily round, today as yesterday, and tomorrow as today ... But it is not possible to idealize this past, nor a habit so mechanical that, with rare exceptions, one got married without knowing why, had children without knowing why, and got them married in mtn without asking their opinion, 50 that it continued over and over in the same way, without any specific goal or reason other than the petcmptory commands of manners and c~~toms. S ince then, the revolutions that have successively brought us steam, electricity, mechanimtion and atomic energy have transformed the face of the world, and habit as a substitute for buppiness has disappeared during these upheavals. This means that, although we hear people claim hnppiness with growing fewour in the feverish atmosphere of our times, we find ourselves in a void. If a few 'last of the Mohicans,kith their outdated mentality, raise their voices to call for a return to the 'normal' state of things, in their ndive sincerity they appear like mediaeva1 knights leading a cavalry charge against armoured cars1 I n spite of everything, the need for happiness not only continues, but drives human beings, now deprived of the passive solutjon of habit, to look fot other infinitely more dynamic or even explosive solutions. The character of these is particularly appropriate to the generally accelerating pace of life jn the world of 'A' influences. Since happiness cannot be found 2. Pushkin, Eupc Omgin."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"in this domain, for reasons that the reader of \"nosis' knows, one falls back on the ephemera1 substitute; pleasure, in all its forms. The more violent and easy this is to find, the less it endures, yet this is what we ask for today, and progress makes it possible for us to attain it in ever greater measure. There are also healthy elements, in the rising generation of our youth, who still demand to be shown ways that lead toward authentic and lasting satisfactions. Gnosis shows the best Way, and there are many paths that lead to it. We will now briefly consider the path reserved for thegroup we have called the Furnib. L et us take the classic case of a young man and a young woman who have tender feelings toward each other. Usually they think of mar- riage without having the slightest foreknowledge of the esoteric possibi- lities that this offers. Thcy will simply bc fillcd with vaguc and blinding ideas on what has come to be called the Great .hue. This is an expression used by those who do not know its esoteric significance, and who are ignorant of the union of polar beings in the triumph of the Second Birth. CertajnIy our two young people know nothing of this, but, fasci- nated by what is no more than a mirage, every day they come closer and closer to marriage. Leaving aside details of the stages of this approach, which contain ele- ments of a free ramnee between the future partners, we will only say that the process takes place following an ascending gamut of which it occupies the first three notes: DO, RE and MI, as shown in fig. 20 (opposite): DO' : the meeting between the two young people and the manifestation of a reciprocal attraction with varying intensity and quality; RE: thc young man and the young girl set each other mote and more frequently. Thcy end, tightly or wrongly, by convincing themselves that tky are made for each ather; MI : the process unfurls, unhampered, and the young peopIe decide to get married, to crate a home, and to lean on each other for the rest of their lives; Y' : now they €ace the interval whose crossing demands a decisive action: marriage. A commentary is necessary here. The aspiration that Ieads to the decision to unite with the chosen being can take either of two directions which form a fork in the path: ignoring marriages contracted 'without rhyme or reason', it may be a hlic marriage or a ptra~~fp~atit marriage, understood as meaning that the psyche is presentas an elernect in both cases, although in different degrees. La Sol Fa +' A pneumatic marriage will ensure the direct development of the ymut reproduced above, and will enable the happy partners to art.& Lovt at the level of ~0~ at the time of their Second Birth: this will be a union for Eternity, in the consciousness of their real I, bipolar in itself but ONE and indivisible for them both. In the following chapters we will study the evoIution ofthis direct gamut through the notes FA, SOL, LA, SI and v2, until the crowning point. For the moment, we only want to call the reader's attention to the following detail, More going on to the analysis of the fork. While the goal of the pneumatic marriage is a union for Eternity, that of the hylic marriage does not go beyond the limits within which thehyle exists; that is, of the physical body of one of the partners. In this way, the possibilities for spiritual evolution of each of them remains intact, and this is why the Orthodox Church, which admi~s divorce in principle, also foresees cases where one or the other may enter a religious order during the other's lifetime, since he or she then becomes 'dead' to world 'A'. The pneumatic marriage imposes special conditions, notably abstinence, which provides the tompItmtnfar_r shock necessary to cross the interval between FA and MI of the direct gamut. Besides this, the husband and wife are called on to make a series of successive efforts which, taken together, represent the vow they undertake to respect to the end of time and even beyond. This vow gives them what one may call a certain amount of 'credit'. It is this that enables them to pursue direct development of this 3. f Corinthians xiv: 1."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"gamut, on condition that they gradually repay this debt at each of the notes that follow, which take the form of trials that they must overcome. In the hylic marriage, the vow of the couple ties them to each other only for the duration of the existence of one or other of them. The marriage sacrament only destines them to be otrefle~h:' All Christian churches agree on this point. According to the words of St Paul, after the death of the other, either partner is free to contract a new marriage. The hylic marriage, therefore, does not require a conscious effort by either of them to dominate nature and master the demands of the 'I' of the body. Because of this, and because of the Law of Seven, in choosing the hylic direction, the gamut of the terrestrial marriage deviates by dividing itself at this veiyplact, as shown in our diagram, and from then on the part which forks off deveIops very differently from the way the same notes unfold in the direct part. PA : this note should sound until it reaches the v3, that is, its vibrations should extend over the remainder of the Earnut. It cortesponds to FA 96 of - the first gamut of nutrition, from which it derivcs. IFits rcsonancc is good, it governs the hylic action of the notes SOL, LA, SI, and y3, up to and including orgasm and ejaculation. It is necessary to point out another correspondence here - this time with the Third cosmic Octave-it being understood that this is a general- ization for the whole of organic Life on Earth. The present case concerns an internal, individuaI gamut, which concerns only the two partners. For this reason, it is oriented in the opposite direction, and develops alter- nately according to the will of the man or according to that of the flesh (woman): to end at the 'birth of blood'. If the note FA of the diverging part of the marriage-octave produces an impure sound, or even a pure sound without harmony between the couple, then on the plane of the psyche the development of this gamut comes to a stop. But it continues on the hyIic plane, where it takes on an exaggerated degree of bestiality; in this case the note SOL cannot sound in full. agreement, the negative part if nor. In the latter case, the act provokes a feeIing of aversion but does not prevent conception - an important fact that we will return to later. Let us note that in the present case, the LA 24 involves only a faint vibration of FA 24, and practically nothng of RE 24; we may well understand why. SI : in this note the couple, normally impregnated with Hydrogen SI. 12, should reach a harmonious orgasm. In practice, however, this happens only toe seldom because of the lack of strength and clarity of resonance of the notes that follow Hydrogens 48 and 24, not to mention the lack of SOL 12, and above a11 of MI 12, of which we spoke at length jn Chapter XIV of the present volume of 'Gnosis'. Y : ejaculation. We repeat that the lack of the psychic element in carnal Iwe is no obstacle to the fertilization of the ovule. We must recognize this as a sign of divine wisdom, for, without this, the reproduction of the species would gradually diminish. 3 DO : conception. If conditions are propitious, the a asms that nccom- S pany ejaculation enable the crossing of the interval Y . In DO^, Impteg- nated with Hydrogen 1306, conception takes place. A new gamut starts with conception, when the spermatozoon, pro- pelled by the energy released in the orgasm accompanied by ejacula- tion, crosses the interval and goes on to penetrate the ovule, uniting with it in DO^. The gamut of conception is naturally a descending octave: in its notes, SI, LA, SOL and FA, the pregnancy follows its four stages; the interval from FA to MI is filled by the pains and efforts of the woman in labour; in the note MI the breaking of the waters occurs, and the actual birth of the child takes place in the note RE. Finally, with the first cry of the newborn, the life of an independent organism begins in ~0~. SOL: This note of the diverging part of the gamut commands the prelude in the physical union of the couple in carnal love, a prelude that normally falls under the aegis of the third sun of the food diagram, DO 48, or the Hydtogen of visual and auditory impressions in its passive form. When there is harmony between the partners, this is helped by SOL 48 and MI 48. LA : the carnal act. This act falls under the aegis of LA 24, which makes the affective sector of the motor centre vibrate, the positive part if there is 4. Genesis ii: 24. 5. Gnosis Vol. I.

We will now leave it to specialists to find out how the different notes of our gamuts link to the physiology of the organs in the couple whose synergy ensures carnal: lwe and conception in conjugal life. To produce concrete"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"results, we must base our analysis on the food diagram, within the general framework of the complete Enneagram. We will now tackle the obscure problem of the influence of the psyche on the physical in the development of the gamut of hyIic marriage, as well as the possible action of this influence on the kind of conception that occurs. In this way, we will come back to the question that interests us most here, which is the meaning and eventual mission of the Family and how it relates to successful evolution through the Time of Transition. S everal times we have emphasized the urgent need for children endowed with pronounced esoteric predispositions in the coming generations. With sufficient work, they could take their places among the new ruling eIite whose task is to materially realize the passage of humanity into the Era of the Holy Spirit. We must now see how the Family, and especially the parents, can ensure their presence. This natu- rally requires efforts, and as always when we deaI with esotericism, these must be CORI~'UMJ efforts. We must first have a clear idea of the nature of these efforts, then of their point of application. This is a question of the possible influence of the psyche as a factor in the incarnation of a particular category of souls attached to our planet: in other words, a sort of birdh-control, but in quite a different sense than the one given to this word by organizations that are preoccupied with demographic increase in the world, and are anxious to stop it. If we refer to the Introduction to the second volume of 'Gnosis', and especially to the schema dealing with the supersensory worId, which we reproduce here, we can easily reaIize that, for the success of the Time of transition, it is very important to arrange things so that the incarnation of souls of the Y zone is favoured more than the incarnation of souls of the SI zone: All the souls attached to Earth must reincarnate kfore the hginning of the Era of the Holy Spirit, but it is obvious that the incarnation of the most developed souls first offers more chances of success. Selective incarnation will make sure that coming generations wilf contain the greatest possible 1 number of polar beings who are able first to recognize each other, then to form couples who will pIedge themselves to a marriage that follows the direct gamut, with the intention of rapidly teaching the Second Birth. These are the cohorts - of all races and all colouts - who, at the head of a really United Nations, will lead humanity along the road of esoteric evolution, through the Cycle of the Holy Spirit, up to the thousand years without war, and the Last Judgement. *This should enable all races and nations in the world to measure the importance of birth-co~trol in the form that we have defined it. We must not forget too that the SI. zone of the supersensory world contains in its lower part souls - who are unhappy and to be pitied -who are loaded with a frightfuI karmic burden, full of negative emotions and rancour, who are driven to incarnate by an unhlfilled will to dominate. The horrors perpe- trated during the Second World Wax enable us to foresee what will happen on earth if we allow these dregs of the disincarnated to prevail over the developed sou15 and so spread over our planet. Even if such a mass inva- sion does not take place, there is a coIumn of anti-Christs that continues to infiltrate into the ranks of humanity. T n short, the control towhich we are referring amounts to the selection of 1 souls, allowing the more developed to pass before the backward ones. This enterprise gains its full importance if we consider that the long predicted struggle between the two humanities6 seems imminent: the two world wars and the balance of terror which followed them, and under which we continue to live, are only a prelude to this. When will this collision between the two humanities take place? Will it be in twenty, thirty or fifty years? Nobody can tell; but there is no doubt that a triumph of the dark souls would bring about the dded of the HQ~ 6. The rcadcr may find a contradiction here if he rcrncmbcrs that we said above that pm-adamics do not re-incarnate. We therefore ernphasizc that, cvm if they are not te-incarnated i#diuidwlb, due to the lack of the renl 'I' even in the potential Form in which thc adamics possess it, pre- adamics do, however, incarnate from the collcrtiw real 'I' which belongs to each group of prpndamic humanity: First, the mccs, then the subdivisions which exist in the hcart of the latter, according to the group of civirizing agents to which onc belongs. We rcfcrred to this in the second Volume of 'Gnmis' when we spoke of Danllevsky's theory. Iris therefore, really a struggIt between the twa humanities, adamic and prc-adamic, but, while adamic souls can k individmlh dark or evolved, prc-adamics, who cannot reincarnate ind~vi- dually, are reincarnated invast group corning from the 'l'ofthc rol/crtivcPersonality.

L et us now come to the technique by which we can make chis selection of souls awaiting incarnation. First, it is important to note that the more evolved are generally in less of a hurry than the backward ones, who are burdened by the spirit of Evil. While the latter greedily sejze every I occasion to be incarnated, the former choose theirparents, seeking far an atmosphere of love, for conditions that will ensure that they have a body that corresponds to their degree of evolution, and for an adequate education, Normally, the FA of the part which diverges from the direct gamut spreads wer all the other notes of this part. This is why conception takes place regardless of the psychic climate in which the carnal act is accom- plished. And this is why, in the great majority of cases, these are children of I 'chance'. A conception where love between the progenitors is absent, or I when they are under the influence of negative emotions, or worse still, under the influence of alcohol or of drugs, gives a good opportunity for dark souls who are looking for an opportunity to be incarnated, and they rush ta make the best of it. 1 W hen the fusion of the two sexual centres takes place, conception is accompanied by a reduction of the chtomatic material of the male and female gametes, sa that the child inherits only half of his father's chromosomes and half of his mothet\\. Even if we suppose that every block (chromosome) of genes always presents the same variety in each of the partners, nothing guarantees that in all the successive conceptions the reproductive cells of the child will always receive the same mixture from one or the other. The fact that children from the same parents are never alike, even when they are twins, simply shows that this js not what really happens. 7 In its present state, positive science is not able to tell us what factors govern the selection of the 23 chromosomes contributed by each proger I tor from the 46 found in each. But esoteric scicnce gives US pteci 7. According to theTradition, beauty spots are just likcfingct-prints: therearencvet two exactly alike; and these are signs which distinguish one body from another. traditional indications about this: it is the soul that wants to be incarnated which chooscs from among the genetic characteristics offered by the cou- ple. But, by conscious efforts, the couple can exercise a certain influence over this choice. Ever since the fall of Adam, and the mixing of the adarnic and pre- adarnic races that resulted from it, the chromosomes of the one are mixed with the othet in us, and each of them is stained with karmic burdens accumulated during former incarnations. Blue blood is therefore not some- thing that one can inherit by birth: it can only be regained at the Second Birth, which depends on the fulfilment of successive tasks imposed during the cIimbing of the Staircase. As far as the chromosomes are concerned, the role of the couple can be compared to that of a window-dresser who arranges his merchandjse so that the passer-by caamt help going in to buy. The assortment of chso- mosomes that each of us possesses carries a great diversity of genes. Normally, esoteric evolution starts by ridding the chromosomes of the karmic burdens which stain them, then it operates to sort them according to their adamic or pre-adamic origin. Thls 1s intended to enable their appropriate use. We must also note th.at all the chromosomes are not stained with negative karmic burdens, and that the latter, when present, can differ quantitatively as well as qualitatively. On the other hand, as intermediaries between the supersensory plane and that of living matter, the chromosomes are in danger of being subject, and are in fact subject, even if the fact cannot be constated, to the inff uence of the psychic (moral) life of the individual in the succession of all the good or bad, noble or evil acts that he may perform. This is a very mechanical reaction, but, by conscious and well-oriented efforts, the couple can progressively cleanse their chtomosornes of their karmic burdens, and bring to the fore those that will be sought by devel- oped souls. It is through the play of this psychosomatic mechanism-aplay that can be the result of conscious8 action, or simply of circumstances9 - that children can surpass their own parents in countless ways. We repeat that, to enable developed souls to be incarnated, it is necessary to produce conditions which meet their needs, and this makes the follow- ing demands on the couple: I. sexual harmony that ensures the full blossoming of carnal love; 2. a psychosomatic attraction; 3. a psychic love capable of transporting the three lowcs centres ~irnd- t~neaus~, even if only for a few moments; 8. Prayer, for example. 9, As an cxamplc of the influmce of circumstances, we can quote thc case of kctitia Ramolino, Charles-Marie Bonapam's wife, the mother of Napofcon. When she was carrying the latter during thc war, she joined with the men in shooting in the Tmrsimn mountains."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"4. a love of children in general; 5. the passionate desire to raise beautiful, gifted children; 6. finally, through their conscious attitude toward love, the wiII to offer to a developed soul a body worthy of his incarnation. This enumeration of the minimum conditions is not, by definjtion, exhaustive; other requirements will arise in the minds of the couple once they choose this way. I n short, one must arrive at a point where the act of carnal love is not dimply a source of sensual pleasure. Along with the desired psychic elements, it must become an act that occurs on different planes and is thus a true sacrament, touching the mystery. If the two partners are animated by an ecstatic desire to k the artisans of this transformation, they will reach an orgasm of full abandon, in ditcct contact with that zone of the supersensory plane that is birthed in the be of the Absolute 11, nnd this will be the point of culmination. Preparation for the sacrament of conception should begin with betrotha1 and continue right through married life. By contributing toward the success of the Time of transition as they favour the Incarnation of evolved souls, the couple will also contribute toward their own esoteric evolution. If they prove to form a polar couple, this ptogress will be greatly accel- erated. In the opposite case, each of them will powerfully magnetize his or her respective polar being. To be fulfilled, the mystery of the desired incarnation requires a conjugal atmosphere free of all lies - exptcsscd or thought - as well as a common interest in the Doctrine, the assiduous study of the latter and finally, a consciousness of the importance of the accepted mission, a consciousness that will make carnal love a source of joy and of unsuspected satisfaction. It was in just such a communjon of ideas and feelings that Zacharjah and Elizabeth conceived John the Baptist. CHAPTER XXL T he world is suffering from a lack of harmony which gets deeper on every plane, and this is a serious danger to the moral and spiritual recovery of humanity. It also involves a serious risk of failure in the last stage of this Time of transition that we are now entering, If this risk is not overcome, the Deluge of Fire awaits us. We wilI have to make an immense eEort to ward off this fate, and we have very little time in which to do it. Man has only himself to blame for the greatness of the effort needed: this is a result of his obstinate refusal to heed the warnings that have been addressed to him time and again by the Divine Voice, just as he continues today to blind himself to the fact that the Deluge of Fire is being made ready; that it is now technically feasible and - it must be said - morally possible. T his final cataclysm, towards which humanity is advancing so blindly, can only be avoided by the cons~io~~s superefforts of the spiritual elite, especially by young and enthusiastic elements of the present generation and those which follow it, whose esoteric predispositions will make thcm fit to assume key positions in all races and in all nations. This is the present situation, stripped of every illusion and all lies to ourselves. Neither the most marvellous technical progress nor greater refinement of the intellectual faculties will be enough to enable us to remedy ths state of affairs, which is still deteriorating. The balance of terror - the only stability that men have reached by the combined deveIopment of the intellectufil and motor centres of the deified Personality, leaving the emo- tional centre in an almost abandoned state- has led the human being and hjs civilization to chimerical results and to an imbalance in which the tendencies of 'Cain' weigh heavily.' A real and durable peace, that is, a stable international balance, cannot be realized on a planetary scale as long as the education of the ruling elite is limited to the development of their intellectual and motor centres: only a developed emotional culture, some- thing that is sadly lacking today, could balance the Personality and thus I.

Have we not been too generous in saying that every individual has retained a minimum of 25% of divine beauty in his body, which in truth is generally ugly and sometimes monstrous? Let us examine our own face: once youth has gone, it fades and is lined with wrinkles; later, it begins to look likc a mask with a fixed expression. Most of the time this reflects the conceit with which we try to compensate for our profound nullity, as well as the fear, envy, and jealousy which haunt us. The older man grows, the more his once shining look loses its brjghtness. His mask changes. It is werrun by an expressionofapathy. His desires become more and more elementary and, finally, he is happy to see the end of his terrestrial existence draw near. He sees this not as a final failure, but as a liberation from the meaningless labours that make up a life 'just like that of so many others.' 2. Luke xvii: 26-29. 3. Ibid., 37. Now let us look around us: is there anything that is not destined to djsappcar sooner or later, even if some things survive for a time after the men who created them. More than once we have said that the object of esoteric work on the individual plane is Victory over Death - the goal that a11 true religions preach, especially Christianity, since the GospeI is precisely the Good New ofthe victory over Death that was announced and promised by Jesus in these terms: 'in the worldye ~haii have trib~!utioa; bwt be of pod cheer, I have overcome the ~vorld.'~ S even ways are open to the courageous and persevering Faithful-and each one leads to the final Victory, where setbacks and falls are no Ionger possible. Traditionally, the first three are intended for men 1,2, and 3 respectjvely. They are called: the Wq of the Servant, (of the fakir in the Orient), the Wa3, of the Monk, and the Wg of the Scholar (Khojn in the Orient and Yogi in India). These three ways, which ultimately combine in man 5, all lead to the state of man 4.5 We have abo seen that there exists a fourth way which, by accomplishing the tasks of the first three ways combined, allows one to come directly and more quickly to the state of man 4: this is called the Woy of the tre& man, because the person who chooses it makes use of all his faults and negative emotions to assist his progress. This way has been dealt with in detail in the Tradition, especially in the teaching of Tohn Climacus, who describes it - .. concisely in the following words: 'The true wise man is he rYho turns everything fo bir btnqff.'\"' The key words of the first four ways are the following: I.

STUDY: study in depth in any branch of science, leading to the limit of pure reason in order to reach the contemplation of the thing in itself; IV. CONTROL: control of oneself, by which the sly man forces himself to act, inwardly and outwardly, as ifhis magnetic centre were already passably developed and had assumed the general direction of the three lower centres - in other words, to act in all circumstances, using the three centres as if thg were already passabfy developed and balanced. S elf control by means of constatation practised on all occasions is a particular characteristic of the fourth way. If the faithful has this attitude towards his Personality, he is led in his daily life to make almost uninterrupted constatations, and it is this that ensures his progress, providing that he makes conscious efforts and does not fall into somnolence in which he has only an illusion of practising constatation. This has a powerful influence on the underdeveloped and unbalanced Personality, and the disciple soon feels the beneficial effects. But in order not to drain the reserve of fine Hydrogens which we need for the practice of constata- tion, we must not go too fast nor make exaggerated efforts. In fact, the same method is as good for constatation as for the physical exercises we practise to develop the body; if we do not want to exhaust all our strength, we must approach it gradually and with moderation; thus, constatation must be practised in such a way that the reserve of fine Hydrogens is not drained but conserved. If the disciple observes the required moderation in his progress on the fourth way, he will increase this reserve, and will gradually, and sanely, be able to intensify his efforts. The exhaustion of our reserve of fine Hydrogens is accompanied -and this is how we recognize it - by a loss of interest in esoteric work. By making sure that this does not happen, we maintain this interest, and we feel it grow as we progress. B ut, even though the fourth way offers us the possibility of rapid pro- gress, it is not without danger. On this way, the student plays the role of a man 4 towards his Personality, even while he is not yet that. In these conditions, by immediately taking his fate into his own hands, without experience, it is almost inevitable that he commits errors ofconception and judgement. These will naturally be reflected in his acts, to the greater profit of the General Law. The latter will supervise him much more closely than for the disciples who follow the first three ways, where progress is much slower. And the more he advances on the fourth way, the harder will be the eventual falls, especially if he continues his activities within the framework of day-to-day life: it is even possible that they will take on a catastrophic character to the point of bringing about disassociation of the Personality. Monastic life, which keeps the faithful isolated from the world of 'A' influences and its complications, is certainly more favourable for accom- plishment of the tasks imposed on the fourth way. The ultimate trial which awaits man on this way, when he is approaching the Second Threshold, will come to him from Woman, in the form of a mirage of his polar being. Whether the disciple works in the silence of the cloister or in the noise of the world, this trial is the same. For the monk, it is even more dangerous, since it offers him an image which borders on materialization, and which pursues him day and night until he falls or achieves Victory. ven as the fourth way leads directly to the state of Man 4, thefifth way Eleads directly to that of man 5. However, there is a fundamental difference between this way and the other four: in the latter, the postulant (male or female), can reach the Second Threshold on his own. It is when he crosses this Threshold that he becomes conscious of his real 'I7, which is androgynous by nature, and this then places him, inrpirit, face to face with his polar being-his true neighbour- whether the partner is living or dead, for, as St Paul says '... neither is the man without the woman, nor is the woman without the man in the L.ord.\" This fifth way is open only to couples, especially to couples who sincerefy believe they are polar, because, on this way, the sine qua non condition for success is simultaneous obedience to two commandments on which, according to Jesus' words, 'hang aN the law and the ~rophets~: To Love God with all one's being'1° - an obligation which has to be respected very naturally on whichever way one wishes to advance - and 'to Love one's ne&bbowr aJ oneself.\"' 8. 1 Corinthians xi: 11. 9.

Let us return to our calculation of the partial polarities that can exist between man and woman, or vice versa. We have seen that, starting from the twelve sectors ofthe two motor centres ofa couple, wc may reach sixty- I six types.I4 Each of these sectors can become an organ of manifestation of 1 the energy SI 12 of the sexual centre as it acts. 1 These sixty-six types represent the possibilities of more or less 'legit- imate' relationships. Those that are formed outside this group belong to the vast domain of 'considerations' and of prostitution. These sixty-six types, taken as a whole, express the different possibilities ofpureCy carnal love. Four types out of the sixty-six associated with the 'I' of the body, which is essentially polygamous or polyandrous, are different from the others by nature and, because thy are distinct, are not included amongst them, but are added to the list, thus carrying the number to seventy. In the first place, it is a question of three cases in which one of the three centres of the Personality is wholly engaged-and so of three cases where hylic love is accompanied by psycchic love so that, from then on, it no longer simply represents three of the many possibilities of 'legitimate' mistresses or lovers, but the three possible husbands or wives allowed by the Orthodox Church in cases of widowhood or divorce in their recog- nized forms. It stops at this figure precisely because the natural possibilities of polarity of the psyche do not go any further. T he distinctive signs of these three cases of polarity of the psyche, which can lead to three unions which are canonically and esoterically legitimate- but which only engage the couple for the terrestrial life of the psyche - are the following: I. When the polarization of the motor centres is complete, the attraction that the man and woman feel towards each other has its centre of gravity in the sense of touch, which prevails over the other sensory impressions: then there is, in the act of carnal love, such a deep confluence that the couple may momentarily lose consciousness of their intellectual and emotional functions. 11. When the polarization of the intellectual centres is complete, the attraction is of another order: it is visual in the woman, and auditory in the man. These cases were relatively rare in past centuries, but they are multiplying in our days, now that intellectual formation is the same for the two sexes. 111. When the polarity of the emotional centres is complete, on the contrary, the attraction is visual in the man and auditory in the woman. Of course, these distinctive signs exist in full only where, theoretically, the functions of the centres are not mixed; or in other words, when no centre interferes in the domain of the others. In addition, the sexual energy must not be previously usurped by one or two of the three centres, but must be discharged equally through them all, so that they may all be oriented together towards the act of carnal love, each taking its particular role. T he fourth example of the distinct cases mentioned above -- and the seventieth of the total number - is that of truly polar beings.15 Here the real 'I' is involved, and the couple's Love, while containing all the possibilities already described in the preceding cases, has a singularly 12. Matthew xxii: 37-40. 13. Ibid., xiii: 15. 14. Vol. 11, pp. 255, 256. 15. Regarding this, it is interesting to note a passage from Nestor's Russian chronicle A Tole of Times Gone By, in which he relates how, in the year 989 (AD) an Imam was called to the Court of the Great Prince Vladimir, who wanted to hear what were the principal dogmas of the Islamic religion. This is what he was told: '... Mohammed teaches that it is necessary to practise circumcision, not to eat pork, and not to drink wine. But after death, he will compensate each one with seven9 beautiful girls, and when one has been chosen from amongst the others, he (Mohammed) would concentrate in her, the beauty of all the others, and she would become the wife of the one who chose her.'

It naturally follows that as this I.ove is hylic, psychic and spiritual at the same time, thus leading to an attraction that is visual, auditory and tactile, it is incomparably richer. The chief characteristic of this so-called Royal case is the bi-polarity of the real 'I'one for each couple. This orients their Personalities and their bodies16 in such a way that what each hopes for and awaits from the other is precisely, and very naturally, what the other desires to and is prepared to offer. It is only in a case of this kind that there can be absolute harmony between a couple, and even this is conditional on each of them trying progressively to liquidate his or her karmic burden and to establish a balance between the lower centres, whose development must be pushed to the limit. These are the combined objectives which the allegedly polar couple who enter on the fifth way must seek through their work. This means that, right from the beginning, the Knight and his Lady-elect must practice courtly Love, which unites in itself Faith, Hope and Knowledge (Gnosis). After the Second Threshold, this involves the acquisition of new faculties, and once this task has been accomplished, it comes to an end in the note MI of the Way. fter that, the couple will have to pass through the Sixth and Seventh A Ways, conceived reciprocally in the RE and DO of the Great way.\" 1 %le honours and high divinegrades in Christ Jesus, of which St ~aul' speaks, arc traditionally defined as follows: V.

Only what is absolute will withstand their icy breath. What is this ~bsoluie? It is Love! The Lord Love, who is the Lord ~od,\" the true Light which shines in the Darkness - and the Darkness retreats, unable to contain it.\" It is Love in all its manifestations, on the whole scale of Creation, on all degrees of the Great Octave. In a perpetual reversible movement, Love, when descending, pours its seed into all creatures to make them bear its fruit afterwards by gaining Consciousness, by which they reascend the Ladder leading to Absolute a/gebraic zero.\" Everything tends towards this algebraic Absolute Zero, having conceived the Zero temperature Absolute where every creature, on all the planes of the Relative, loses its relativity, to render up its absolute seed to Absolute Love, the Source of Life, enriched by the experience acquired during its ephemeral existence. I f love were removed, organic Life on Earth would cease and our planet would become a cosmic corpse. Man is placed at the head of organic life on Earth, and called on to lead it on the path of divine evolution. His failings, crimes, and the spirit of incompetence that govern him, which rejected Love and embraced Pas- sion and Hate, have once again led the Earth to the edge of the Abyss. Today - as two thousand years ago - the Lord Love is trying again to kindle our faint and hardened hearts with his sacred fire. He hopes to regenerate and revive us with his warmth, beauty, and truth, and lead us by his Gnosis toward the permanence of his Kingdom, which is approaching us again today! 16.

This is a question of conquering the Darkness which has established itself in us; of conquering it through the strength of the Conqueror, which is Love. It is also a question of saving the Earth by saving organic Life on our planet - by raising it up from the downward slide of degeneration which it now follows, which is approaching the Abyss of Zero degrees Absolute at an ever faster pace. W e know that it is necessary to descend to a temperature of -273. lG°C to reach Zero degrees Absolute. On the other hand, we know that the temperature of the external layer of the sun is about 6000°C. This temperature reveals the level of intensity of organic Life on our Star, the SOL of the Great Octave. Thus, in degrees of temperature, the pitch of the pulse of Life in this segment of our Ray of Creation, situated between the Sun and the outer Void, is equal to: 6000\" + 273\" = 6273\" approximately. If we take the temperature of the human body, about 37\"C, as the cosmic measure of Man, we will realize how close man is to the outer Darkness, and how great is the distance which separates him from the vivifying Light emanating from its Source, which is our Lord, Love-God and God-Love, the Sun of Truth. Thus man is separated from the darkness of Zero degrees Absolute by 37\" + 273\" = 310°C, while the distance which separates him from the sun is 6000\" - 37\" = 5963°C approximately. In other words, in relation to the Source of organic Life on Earth, and therefore, to the source of his own life, man is situated at a thermic distance NINETEEN times greater than that which separates him from Zero degrees Absolute, that is, from the outer Darkness where all Life, all existence, and every vibration ceases for lack of the warmth of Love. If we take the thermic distance of 310°C which separates man from the Nothingness as the characteristic measure of his state of evolution on the cosmic scale, we can understand that when he crosses the First Threshold, man 1, 2, or 3 will have nineteen similar stages to pass through before reaching and crossing the Third Threshold! We might say that this is terrifying. Yet, when the disciples asked the question: 'Who then can be saved?' Jesus looked at them and said: 'With men this is imposible, but with Godall things are possible.' 23 B esides thepositive types of allegedly polar couples we have just studied, there are other types of partial, negative polarity of a pathological nature. These cases are numerous. Here, we will limit our description to an analysis of the only extreme case falling within this category. This is characterized by a complete polarity of the motor centres, as well as of the negative parts of the two other centres, the positive parts of which are in a state of profound lethargy. Only the heavy karmic burden of a past full of crime, of devouring passions, of violence, and of cold-blooded cruelty, accumulated in com- mon through several incarnations, can lead to such a deformation of two Personalities and knit them together so closely. As long as the two partners are alive, their activity is limited to the horrors of the crimes which fill the forensic news. But, in certain cases, the discarnate woman survives after death and takes on the demonic form of a succubus. The man, who is still alive, then combines the presence and strength of the two Personalities in his being. Let us note that, with the integral polarity of the two motor centres, and with the positive parts of the two other centres atrophied, the 'double-being' formed in this way has no doubts -and cannot have any. The total assurance he has of himself then doubles his strength, which becomes demonic. This type represents the pathological phenomenon of the negative andra- une. Through a large usurpation of dual sexual energy, a black androgyne of this kind becomes extremely strong and wicked. Bringing together in him the two Personalities, closely united by strong negative passions; hate, jealousy, vengeance, and lastly a thirst for blood, this possessed man is a true danger to society. This extreme case of the negative, pathological, demonic and bestial androgyne is the opposite of the angelic androgyne that can be achieved by man after he passes the Second Threshold. We mention it for this reason, and also to give the reader an idea of the profound meaning of the parable concerning the man of the Gadarenes who was possessed by -- -- 23.

More exactly, it occurs in three groups of forms. These groups exist on three different levels of conscious- ness. For each individual, the first group from below to above the largest contains the sixty-six types of polarization that are possible between the twelve sectors of the motor centres in the opposite sexes. Ifneither of the two other centres is involved, this kind of attraction only produces the temporary link of a free romance, or, in current language, an affair. Only the typical man 1, who is polygamous by nature, can find deep satisfaction in this. And these cases are rather rare as this is a purely physiological phenomenon as a result of the overproduction of Hydrogen SI 12 by both the masculine and feminine organisms. For men 2 and 3, the constatation of whose psyche is more developed and refined, pure carnal love- when it occurs without even partial parti- cipation by one or two of the other centres -- appears as the maximum expression of the bestial side of human nature. In such cases, Love merely takes the forms of desire andpleasure. Once physical desire is satisfied, the person 2 or 3 no longer feels linked to his partner. Instead, he often experiences a reaction, a feeling of having fallen, a kind of shame at having fallen under the sway of his own bestiality. We must say that this fall is real. However, for men 2 and 3, this is so only after they have reached a certain level of inner culture. Generally, without introspectively analysing the movements provoked by this fall - without even realizing it - such a person feels more or less quickly the need to flee from the subject of his ephemeral affair. Once the pressure of the overabundance of accumu- lated Hydrogen SI 12 is reduced - for it is this excess that breaks the balance of the forces of the Personality- the man returns to the habitual if still unstable balance of his psyche. This will then tend to be broken in another direction through the disgust that even a subconscious feeling of this fall produces. This also explains the well-known phenomenon of the unfaithful hus- band who multiplies his attentions to his wife! A completely different reaction may be observed in cases where, in addition to the engagement that is the result of the polarization of"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":".I~LIUTS of the two motor centres, one of the three centres of their Person- alities is totaffy absorbed in Love as a result of the total polarization of this centre in both partners. Then an attraction of the psyche, which is much stronger than purely physical attraction, becomes a factor in the relation- ship between the sexes. Psychology then makes its appearance alongside physiology. This communicates a strength and a delicacy to the love- relationship between the partners which is unknown in the previous case. Here, we are referring to hunlan Love, no longer bestial but giving birth to true romance, not just to an affair. This true romance, still taking the form of the free romance, is characterized by a more or less long period of manifestations of tenderness, with a tendency towards permanence even before the sexual act actually takes place. This situation usually leads such a couple to one of the three cases, within the sixty-six cases that we are studying, that are appropriate for marriage. I n this second group of cases, as in the first, the romance always starts with a physical attraction. However, because of the integral polarity of one of the centres, the pgchic Love thus set in motion immediately takes precedence over hylic or carnaf Love. Enriched and transcended at the same time, carnal love loses the character of a categorical imperative. The strength of sexual attraction does not disappear, but it takes on a new, functional character. We may notice that in the case of purely hylic sexual appeal, the lovers try to pass directly to love-play, quickly followed by the final act. On the other hand, the appearance of Psychic Love acts as a brake on the carnal effects. This is normal. Today, when these customs are considered rather old- fashioned, lovers are called upon to observe a more or less long period of abstinence called the engagement. And the true betrothed usually refrain from sexual relations until their wedding night, in spite of their mutual physical attraction, which may be very strong. At first sight, it is curious to note that 'modern' girls who, before marriage, change lovers as often as boys change mistresses, once they have experienced Psychic Love, will often instinctively refrain from sex- ual relations with their fiancees during the engagement period. Although this fact may be noticed, no one bothers to explain it. Most people are content to defer to tradition and custom. Rarely does someone understand the true role in psychic Love that is or should be played by the betrothal. But, in esoteric work, if both of the couple take part, the engagement, while changing slightly in form, plays a determining role. L et us leave aside cases of conflict between carnal Love and an ima- ginary Psychic Love that often arise between a married couple after initial and reciprocal errors of judgement. These lead either to a rupture or, worse still, to a sometimes artificial and abnormal psychic and sexual coexistence. This contemporary phenomenon is due to the fact that, if the polariza- tion between certain sectors of the motor centre in a couple is real, the alleged integraf polarization of one of the centres of their Personalities is imaginary. The cause of this is that in relationships between man and woman, much more than in other manifestations of life, we take our desires for reality, especially on the masculine side. This is always a direct or indirect result of the influence of the General Law. In time, the original enthusiasm fades-in proportion to the hold of this illusion - and we begin to run into 'discrepancies' from the cherished image, which we have endowed with all its qualities. In the cases where physiology ranks before psychology, we are some- times faced with a phenomenon as bizarre as it is harmful: a strong sexual attraction retains its original character of a categorical imperative, but it is accompanied by a reciprocal aversion of the psyche, or by excessive jea- lousy when the illusion has disappeared in one of the partners but stays alive in the other. These are precisely the cases to be found at the root of crimes of passion. We will set aside the whole scale of conflicts which arise from this mismatch within couples between the manifestation of carnal love and the psychic love which allegedly unites them, and also leave aside the whole scale of 'Gordian knots' which are thus created in life - a scale which forms the subject of psychological novels - since our concern is with human psychic Love. 0 n all planes, the objective sign of Love's participation is the creative spirit which animates the subjects for whom it has become an aim. Conversely, if we think we are in Love but objectively do not notice an increase in creativity on any plane, either in ourselves or in our partner, we can be sure that the relationship is based on anything but Love. The so-called marriage of reason, like the whole scale of physical and psychic prostitution practised by men as well as women, presents a rich variety of different forms and manifestations of these aberrations. 'OH"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"T he phenomenon of true psychic Love is more rare. Kindled by phy- sical attraction, it can attain an intensity on the psychic plane that cannot be compared with any of the cases described above. It is not yet platonic Love, in the complete sense of this term, which is so widely misunderstood, but in the best cases it can approximate this and so pro- duce positive effects. Though rather rare, the phenomenon exists and is real in its essence. We can observe it especially in cases where the rich but latent creative spirit of the man is aroused to manifest in life in all its radiance under the psycho- sexual influence of a woman. This happens in different degrees. Depending on the calibre of Person- ality of the partners, it can affect different planes: emotional, intellectual, and even motor. Generally, when the nature of the man is only ordinary in his profession and among those around him, and the inspiring influence of his partner, although adequate and polar, remains hidden, the phenomenon becomes difficult to observe. This is why it is rarely dealt with in literature, which is preoccupied with the description and analysis of conflicts in the life of the psyches of men and women through the perturbing action of carnal Love. These conflicts produce either a tearing of the Personality, or the collapse of the unstable balance in which each of the partners lived before their fatal encounter. With rare exceptions, the study of this psychic love, which has a positive effect in human beings who are not in any other way out of the ordinary, is not normally discussed. Thus, in order to find examples of this kind of Love and of the effects it can produce, we must look at biographies of remarkable Personalities, and only those biographies that are known to have a certain degree of truth and objectivity. P sychic Love has this characteristic in common with carnal Love on the one hand, and with courtly Love on the other: it begins in spite of circumstances and even propriety. It cannot be 'channelled', and even less can it be 'mastered'. When it manifests it asserts itself with all the force of its objectivity, without asking for the agreement of the partners or the consent of those around them. It emerges in the full glory of its power and its absolute liberty. It remains as it first appears, without any possibility of compromise; its form and its strength marvellously adjusted to the latent needs as well as the creative possibilities of the couple. But their conscious- ness of its mission in life as well as of the domain in which it should be fulfilled generally remains most vague. The appearance of Psychic Love is a kind of divine offer that carries with it adequate means for the practical execution of this mission. It is up to the couple to accept this offer, to grasp the profound meaning of its nature and the opportunity given by its appearance, and, finally, to find points of application in themselves that can be adapted to this divine force in order to respond usefully to its call. This is generally far from easy. It is only rarely that psychic Love occurs in circumstances which provide opportunity for its application. Because of the karmic tare that weighs on each of the partners, this Love appears more like a disturbing force. That is why, more often than not, one of the partners, and sometimes both, will retreat before the vision of a struggle against inopportune circumstances. Instead of breaking with the circum- stances, they prefer to break with Love! We should not judge them. Of course, human frailty is no excuse to turn our back on the divine call. But we should not neglect the implacable fact that man lives bound by old Karma, doubled by what he has created in this present life. But we must admit that the divine call - an expression of the Love of God, since God is Love-never intervenes to give us a command which is beyond our strength. That is why, in their own interest and in the interest of those with whom they live, before they dismiss it as 'impossible', the partners who are in the grip of this psychic Love should minutely analyse their situation and look for an objectively just solution in relation to the Call. A true Call is only made when there is a possible solution to the situation, whatever that may be. They must not adopt a solution blindly: in the first place, they must be convinced that they are really faced with a divine call and have not fallen into a trap laid by the General Law. St John gave us the following indication, which should always be kept in mind: Beloved, believe not evev spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of ~od.' L et us now study a few examples of how Psychic Love acts when, through the intervention of the feminine impulse, it awakens the wealth of the creative masculine spirit which, without this fertilization, would be condemned to remain in the state of unachieved or partially 1. John iv: 1. 21 1"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"achieved possibilities. Pushkin was certainly referring to Psychic Love, when he said: All ages are subject to Love, Its transports are benefital! Pushkin's wife was a beautiful coquette whose success at the Russian Court attracted the attention of Nicholas the First himself. But Pushkin was bound to her only by hylic Love, and in her company he did not find the feminine impulse of the psyche which would bring him the transports he was looking for. He was therefore forced to search for it elsewhere. His poetic genius kept him under a strong, permanent pressure, creating in him the need to express himself. But the 'feminine fertilization' was missing - just as a woman born to have children needs 'masculine ferti- lization' on the hylic plane. 'How you bore me with your poems, Pushkin!' the beautiful Natalie, his wife, would say to him ... And the great poet-the Russian Dante, who was the chief creator of the modern literary language - found the desired influence in the company of Madame K., who had a refined, passionate nature, but who, from all appearances, was not even his mistress! P rofessor Serge Voronoff, the famous innovator in questions relating to rejuvenation, made a deep study of Love and its psychological and physiological effects in correlation with his research in the biological domain. In his work on love and thought in animals and man, he wrote the following: 'Love is not only the attribute of youth and of the age that we call adult. The age where the senses are not yet appeased, the age to love, to create, to live in the joy of the body and the spirit, can be prolonged over the average usually regarded as adult. 'At sixty-four, Wagner conceived a passion for Judith Gauthier, poetess, and daughter of a poet. For him she personified Kundry, the burning mare prostrate at Parsifal's feet - the myth of the woman enslaved by the poet, of the sinner conquered by divine love. Oyou, sweet warm soul, how inspired I tuas inyour arms. he wrote to Judith (Guy de Pourtales). 'Thanks to this divine source of inspiration, love, Wagner at sixty-four created the most beautiful and most marvellous work that his genius ever produced: Parsifal. 'In 1823, at the age of seventy-four, Goethe fell madly in love with Ulric von Leventzow, a young girl of seventeen. His spirit enkindled, he became young again, and once more found in himself the secrets of his exaltation. He drew on this love for another joyous outburst, the passionate return to the lyrical springs of life. When leaving Marienbad to go and beg the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar to ask Mrs. Leventzow, on his behalf, for her daughter's hand, he was in such a state of passion, and of exalta- tion, that he wrote the Elegy of Marienbad at one stretch, and it may be considered one of his most beautiful pieces (Edmond Jaloux). 'In 1883, eighty and still sensitive to feminine charm, Victor Hugo gave his grandson, Georges, his most important piece of advice: \"Love, look for love-love makes man better, Give joy and take it in loving as much as you can. One must love, my son, love well -all one's life!\" 'And one year before, he wrote: \"One has everything, yet one has noth- ing if one does not have love\".' Thus, concludes Voronoff, the psychic phase of love, the marvellous phase, the rising of desire, the rapture of the heart, the exaltation of the spirit, fills our whole being with a kind of felicity, of elation. This is all to the benefit of the individual, in whom it exalts the best qualities-whether or not this phase is followed by the physical phase of love.2 T hese examples were chosen by Serge Voronoff as appropriate to the main subject of his work, which was rejuvenation. He based his work on the principle that old age was a result of a decline in the functioning of the sexual glands, and he revived them, as we know, by means of grafting. Through this - in the language of 'Gnosis' -he was looking for, and in many cases, obtained, a reactivation of the first gamut of nutrition through an adduction of animal SI 12- the nearest to man (chimpanzee). But, he probably did not know that animal SI 12, in even the best cases, only corresponded to the LA 24 of man, the Hydrogen of the motor centre, and not to that of the sexual centre. However, through this, he gave a new impulse to the motor centre in its instinctive function, and indirectb facili- tated an increase in the production of ST 12 in the patient. In certain cases, the result was evident; in others, the grafting was a failure. What is more, the positive result was always temporary, for the organ- ism of the patient fights against a graft of heterogeneous tissue and it is resorbed in a more or less short period. 2.

Paris, Fasquelle Ed., 1936, pp. 136-138."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"T he reader of 'Gnosis' must add the following considerations to what we have just said. The scale of human Hydrogens belongs to the note LA of the Second cosmic Octave. That of animals, even those nearest to man, like the chimpanzee, belongs to the note SOL of the same octave, which is not of the same co~mic nature. Because of this, the SI 12 of the chimpanzee does not even correspond wholly to the human LA 24. What is more, it is evident that complete rejuvenation cannot be attained simply by renewing the working of the first octave of nutrition. Besides, Voronoff and his pupils did not arrive at a complete renewal of the latter through the grafting that they practised. In order to solve this problem, it would be necessary to revive the working of the second and third octaves in parallel and simulta- neously. Voronoff did not take this necessity into account. He seems to have had some inkling of this, but he did not have access to the sche- mata we have reproduced here. However, he understood very well that, rising from the lower to the higher, the rejuvenating action on the plane of the psyche also originates in the sexual domain. He tried to prove this by quoting examples. These very same examples show-and this is essential- that the action of ~exualrejuvenation can be produced on the psychic plane without preliminary rejuvenation ofthe organism on the lylicplane - as the cases quoted by Voronoff prove. We can now draw the following tentative conclusions. In certain conditions of agreement of types (66-3-I), the woman's sexual influence can make the man manifest a rush of creative spirit on the psychic plane. This can happen independently of the carnal relationship which may exist between the couple, but this, on the contrary, often reduces and sometimes prevents such a manifestation on the psychic plane. This must be remembered. We have suggested this theory more than once from different points ofview. At the present time, this kind of psychic relationship between the sexes is expected to become much more common, as it is the principal means of the reorganization of human society by a type of New Man. But we must nevertheless say - we must even underline it - that this marvellous manifestation of the creative spirit in man under the psycho- sexual influence of a woman is subject to a basic condition: the man must possess in himself this creative spirit in a latent state, strengthened with his own original richness. If the man does not possess the creative spirit in potential, even the strongest psycho-sexual impulse from the woman will not ptoduce any material effect - just as a carnal impulse from a man cannot fertilize a sterile woman. Let us add the following: just as one particular woman produces a different effect of carnal attraction on different types of men, so, on the psychic plane, the creative spirit of a man produces a different psycho- sexual attraction on different women. To avoid any confusion of ideas, and to end our commentary on the cases quoted by Serge Voronoff, we must say that the latter necessarily chose his examples from among aged per- sons, since he was trying to rejuvenate worn-out organisms. The phenom- enon of the fertilization of the creative spirit in a man through the psycho- sexual im ulse of a woman retains its full potential whatever the ages of the partners. P W hen researching in this domain, it is therefore necessary to be on one's guard and not slide into a confusion of planes: Carnal Love has its immediate raison d'ctre in the corporeal reproduction of the species, and acts on the lower plane of consciousness; Psychic Love has its immediate raison d'ctre in the production of moral values, and is realized on a plane of consciousness higher than the pre- ceding. The attentive study of the gamuts of nutrition shown in the Enneagram will give evidence of a strong interdependence between the action of these two aspects of Love; psychic and carnal- with a continuous variation in the percentage preponderance of one over the other, as their participation is always inversely proportional. W e must understand that if his Personality has become senile and has lost the vigour and elasticity of youth, it is materially impossible to 'rejuvenate' man by grafting or by other active means which aim at the rejuvenatioaof the patient's body. In the same way, we cannot 'rejuvenate' a Personality which systematically turns its back on the real 'I7, believing itself to be the summit of life. But it is possible, with the support of this real 'I: not only to regain the vigour of youth, but also, through esoteric work, to develop the Personality up to the limit of its possibilities. 3. In the same work, Voronoff also quotes the case of Dante and Beatrice, as well as that of Petrarch and Laure. Ibid., pp. 139-145."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Thus, the problem of rejuvenation, which is that ofpermanence, can only be usefully resolved by appropriate action on the three planes: hylic, psychic, and pneumatic. As far as the physical body is concerned, it is a dangerous illusion to think that grafting, or the introduction of animal organs and cells into the human organism, is beneficial. This idea must be completely, abandoned. Although in certain cases this method may produce a stimu- lating effect, it does not last, and we will now understand why it necessarily leads to a fall of the organism to a lower level than the one at which it was before the treatment. It is possible that we may finally discover a more effective psychosomatic method of rejuvenation than Voronoff s grafting, though we would wish to pay homage to him for his role as a pioneer. What we would like to emphasize is that no results can be obtained in this domain by action limited to the hylic plane as practised today. It is important that specialists who undertake research in this field keep this principle in mind. T hough psychic Love produces fruits that are more durable than carnal Love, the values created by this psychic Love also fade in time. For psychic life in its totality, and on the whole scale of terrestrial human values, is manifested in time and has as its final limit the duration of a particular civilization; after that, centuries or sometimes millennia after the death of their creators, its products fall into Lethe. Only the values acquired on the higher plane of human possibilities do not fade away with the passing of extinct civilizations: these produce spiritual Love, for pneumatic Love combines the supreme wealth of the permanent value that is its higher nature with all the marvels of hylic Love and psychic Love. Symbolically, if we could place carnal Love on the steps of the celestial Temple and psychic Love in its nave, we would find spiritual Love hidden in the Holy of Holies, behind the sacred Veil. From there, as absolute Lord, it gives a raison d'litre to each of its manifestations, whose meaning and mission it fixes and whose breadth and duration it regulates. Most men do not even suspect the true source of Love, whose expression on the physical and psychic planes offers them an irresistible attraction and supreme joys. Here is a very ancient hymn preserved by Tradition for disciples engaged in esoteric work: Our Lord is yeat and glorious. He fills the Universe with his Love! Th_v love belongs to him; The love of the soul is its salvati~n.~ Unfortunately, man does not know how to distinguish Love from pas- sion, so he often takes the reflection for the source. One definition, not of Love, which is indefinable, but of its attributes, has been given by St Paul in terms which are as precise as they are meaningful. We have already quoted it in the two preceding volumes of nosis is'.^ Because of its importance, we are quoting it for the third time: Love, wrote St Paul, sufferetb long, and is kind; Love envietb not; Love vauntetb not itself, is notpuffed up, doth not behave itselfunseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evif. Rejoiceth not in iniquio, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Love never faileth; but whether there beprophecies, thy shall faif; whether there be tongues thy shall tease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.6 If we meditate on this text, we will understand that a true abyss separates love from a 'loving' passion; yet we so often take the latter for love! But passion's motivation is to possess, and this produces effects diame- trically opposed to those described in St Paul's text. The spirit of Love is to give with no return.' L et us now go back to the question of spiritual Love in its practical aspect: this pneumatic Love which is ONE in its thousands of man- ifestations, Lord of our life. Can it be attained by man - and how - here below, in this very life? All the studies in the 'Gnosis' series converge towards this final major aim, which encompasses all the possible aspirations of human beings and which, if it is once attained, opens the door to Permanence. It is only with this Love that man passes from existence to Life. It is with this that man can finally say with certainty that he is happy to have come into the world. - 4. The Golden Book. 5.

(Ed.)"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Ty to attain Love, taught St ~aul.~ This short sentence sums up the whole meaning of the inner and outer work of the disciple who has crossed the First Threshold and starts climbing the Staircase. All through our work we have studied this problem in its different aspects and in every nuance, and we have particularly drawn the reader's attention to the special possibilities offered to the seeker of the Fifth Way, that of the Knight and the Lady of his dreams. Because this Way, which is the way of exception par excellence, is wide open to us now and for the remainder of the time of transition. This possibility meets the urgent need for the rapid formation of a new ruling elite formed of New Men, initiated into pneumatic Love, the one and only thing possible that can conquer the anarchy of a psychic life (which has been) abandoned to itself. T he disciple who chooses the Fourth Wa,r has as a task to act as if his magnetic centre was already formed and passably developed, and must do so in all the circumstances of his inner and outer life. Disciples-necessarily two-who choose the Fifth Wq, the Knight and the lady of his dreams, whether they are so in trd or honest4 claiming to be so, must endeavour to act in all circumstances of their inner and outer life as ifthey were already united in their consciousness of the real 'I,, which is indivisible although bipolar, and ONE for their two Personalities and their two bodies. Their task is more difficult and strenuous than that of the s4 Man. For, right from the beginning, it demands a great conscious effort-in principle permanent - of self-mastery by both partners of the couple. This demands precision in thought, without any 'displacements', and methodical treatment of negative emotions as well as the cultivation of positive emotions oriented - like the mental efforts - towards a carefully and sincerely chosen esoteric goal which is identical for both. They must not only satisfy the demand that they should not lie to themselves, but they must take even more care not to lie to each other in word or in thought, and this from the very day they make the decision to embark on the Fifth Way together. On the other hand, if they fulfil these general conditions of conduct and work, as well as the specific instructions which have been given them, the very fact of walking together while endeavouring at each step to act in the spirit of the bipolar 'I', will greatly facilitate their task. From every point of view, the absolute sincerity demanded of them will form a solid basis for their relationship in all its connections. If this 8. 1 Corinthians xiv: 1. essential condition is not fulfilled, it will give way immediately to a partial or temporary fall, which could even become final if relapses occur. In this case the culprits will be thrown back below the First Threshold, and everything will have to be begun all over again. I n our study we have introduced the notion of couples claiming to bepolar. The time has come to define this, but we think that the attentive reader of 'Gnosis' must have already formed some idea of this subject. In our study of different cases ofpartial polarization, we mentioned the case of complete polarization of one of the three centres of the psyche in a couple. Among the three possible cases of this kind of partial polarization, it is necessary to distinguish one which has a special meaning and which opens up particular possibilities. This is the integral polarization of the two emotional centres of the couple, intensified by the polarization of both the emotional sectors - positive and negative - of their intellectual and motor centres, and even more, by a pronounced polarization of their growing magnetic centres. The relationship between the partners in such a couple is very nearly that of a true polar couple. In these cases-reserved for humans of type 2-the four sectors of their two intellectual centres, and even the four sectors of their motor centres, although they are not polar, will without much dif- ficulty follow the movements ordered by the rest of the psychic system which is developing in the couple. Under the hold of a strong, perfectly normal sexual attraction, marked by a sentimental shade of romantic tenderness due to the polarity of their emotional centres and with the whole of their psychism oriented towards the same esoteric goal, a couple with this makeup will sincerely think that they are a true polar couple. We will then see them step enthusiastically onto the Staircase in order to attain the Second Birth. If two beings with this conformation meet when one or even both of them are below the First Threshold, then - like true polar couples - they will find themselves transported, and they will be immediately placed on the third step of the Staircase, that of Knowledge. This immediate transportation to the third step of the Staircase is jus- tified by the very fact of the couple'spolar consciousness, although it does not correspond entirely to reality. Acquired spontaneously because of the complete polarization of their emotional centres, this consciousness kin- dles real Faith in their hearts just as it does for true polar beings. As for Hope, this will be acquired largely because of the polarization of the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"crnotional sectors of the intellectual and motor centres, acting under the aegis of the growing magnetic centres. In these conditions, the work of a couple on the third step of the Stair- case, that of Gnosis, will be made much easier. Their task will then appear to them not as a duty, but as an urgent need, and it will be experienced with a joy that is already of a higher order. T he psychic state established in this way gives the couple the possibility of attaining and practising courth Love. Even if it is not integral in its content and intensity, it will at least be sufficient to reach the commence- ment of the fourth step, that in which Love is all. At this moment, the Knight and his Lady will begin to notice their non- polarity, or more exactly, their lack of integral polarization. If the third step, that of Knowledge, permits a certain dualism by the very nature of the process of acquiring Gnosis- since the way towards the truth neces- sarily passes through doubts-this is not the case on the fourth step. The progress of the couple on this step, the last stage dedicated to the acquisi- tion of Love itself, demands - by its very nature progressive identifica- tion of the partners (with one another), as they are called on wholh to become a unio in polarity. Toward the end of the fourth step, this identification must become absolute so that they are not stopped at the decisive moment, just as the Guardian holds out his flaming sword to To summarize: the polarity assumed by the couple on the First Threshold and estahlishedon the first three steps of the Staircase, gives birth to courtl_y Love, which enables them to attain the fourth step. But from the moment that they reach this step, L,ove in itselfmust be progressively lived. Its nature is such that it can stand no compromise, nor any approximation. If the partners have made a mistake in considering themselves polar, they will quickly realize their initial error of conception. A s we have already said, this error does not entail any grievous results. The opposite is true. Progress on this step, where the virtue to be attained is the androgynous consciousness, will progressively make the non-coincidence of the real '1's of the partners evident. Thus, each of them will learn that his or her true 1x)l;~r 1)cing is [lot the one he or she sincerely I,el~cvccl they s;~w 111 tl~c ot11c.1 Ixirtner. Soon, this negative consciousness will become positive. The conscious- ness of the real 'I' whose light will progressively brighten the depths of their respective beings like the dawn will make them see the image of their true polar beings, whch in each of them will surge up from the depth of their heart. This image will at first be perceived as if through a misty glass, then, with their progress towards the Second Threshold, in a more and more precise and clear manner, and at last it will appear face to face in all its brilliance. At that moment, the 'travelling companions' will understand that, by working together, they were in fact working for four. I t is still necessary to give some additional information which will be needed by true polar couples. From the time they pass the First Threshold until the fourth step of the Staircase, the relative position of the partners remains practically the same as in the previous case. As we have already said more than once, it is only on approaching the Second Threshold that they will finally learn for certain whether their subjectively felt polarity will prove to be objectively real or false. T he first question to resolve is whether two polar beings can belong to two different human types? For example, can man 3 have as his polar being a woman of type 1 or 2? This is absolutely out of the question. The real 'I', which is ONE for the couple, implies an ideal bi-polarity. In the same way, the polarization between the two Personalities of polar beings, a double reflection of that of the real 'I', is also necessarily ideal. That is to say; the polarization between the equivalent centres of their psyches is total. More than this, even the physical bodies of the two polar beings are also rigorously polarized. This is the meaning of the diagram, already shown in Volume 11, whch we reproduce in fig. 22 overleaf: 9. Vol. I, pp. 17&1. 220"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"This diagram is of Adam and Eve before their fall. It survives in poten- tial in every couple of adamic polar beings, whether or not they recognize each other in life. T he second question asked of the Knight in search of his Lady-elect is how he can recognize her when they meet? How can he be sure he does not take a stranger for Her? One of the 66 or the 3? How to avoid passing her by? This question does not exist for the just, for in all circumstances, they see rightly. But for corrupt hearts-and in different proportions, this is the general case - the question is not so easily resolved. The karmic tare leads to a deformation of the Personality until it no longer represents an ideal reflection of the real '1'. This deformation, which is doubled as a result of the burden acquired in this life-for example, the professional deformation of the psyche-covers the Personality with a sort of crust. Becz~zc of this, unless the man is already well-trained in esoteric work, he sees everything through this screen, which deforms the true image of people and things. What is more, only through the deformations produced by their own crust can he perceive the Personality of the human beings he tries to understand. We must add that the karmic tare of two polar beings is not and cannot ever be identical. In order to understand this, it is sufficient to re-read the pages in this work that describe the Film. In fact, by the autonomy of his life, every Personality produces a particular Karma. Among other con- sequences, one result is that two polar beings can be born, not at the same time, as should normally happen, but with a difference in time which in certain cases can be considerable. All this 'muddle' explains why polar beings so rarely recognize each other spontaneously at the moment of their encounter.

B ut before speaking of trials-which will always remain the rule-it is necessary for the two beings gripped by vivifying Love to reach a sincere and almost absolute convinction of their polarity. T he karmic deformation of the Personality, we have said, always appears as a crust on the surface. Behind this crust, the psyche remains itself: more or less developed and more or less balanced. The exercise of constatation, methodically pursued, enables the man to discri- minate between the elements of the acquired crust, which are heteroge- neous by nature, and the 987 little '1's which together form his Personality. Through introspective observation beyond the crust, the man will easily distinguish the human type to which he belongs. This is important. But it is not yet sufficient to make the Knight, once he sees himself in this way, form a precise and ideal image of the Lady of his Dreams. For this, he will still have to make considerable conscious efforts. I n order to approach the problem better, we must go back to the frag- ment from the Golden Book quoted in the second volume, so we will reproduce it here: Evety nzan is born bearing within him the in/qe of his polur being. As he grows, this image grows within him; It takes form and is filled with life and cofour. Man is not conscious of it. Yet it is his ALTER EGO, The La& of his dreams, his PRINCESS OF THE VISION. In quest of her he must eternal4 go. In Her alone, he will find a perfert echo of himself; Of the most intimate, inexpressible movements of his soul, For in their union, the limit between the I and the THOU is obliterated. Since she is his SINGULAR, his LEGITIMATE SPOUSE. And SILENCE will then be the depositaty of the fullness of their Love."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"We can now take another step towards penetrating the profound mean- ing of this text. Man cannot see himself as long as he is identified with the whole: the Personality-Crust. For he is then identified - on the plane of waking consciousness - with what is not, strict4 speaking, himself. By eliminating the crust through exercises he achieves an identification with his naked Personality, and in this way he acquires the possibility of proceeding to an introspection of the second degree. This will then allow him to distinguish within himself the image of his ideal polar being who, says the text we have just quoted, lives within him and, it says exactly, accompanies him night and day all through life from birth to death, just as an idealimage of him lives throughout life in his polar being, untouched by his circum- stances. At this point, the reader of 'Gnosis' will understand for himself what path to follow and where it leads: once freed from the obstacles to the introspection of the second degree, and starting from the 'I' of the Person- ality-now liberated from the crust-man can go on to gain the vision of his real 'I7. In his epistle to the Ephesians, talking of marriage, and quoting the text of Genesis, St Paul discusses this question in the context of the relationship between Christ and his Church: 'For this cause shalla man leave his ather and mother and shall be joined unto his wijr and they two zhall be ~n~j?~sh..\" And he adds: 'This is a great mystery.'\" To come back to man's search for the image of his polar being in himself -this mystery consists of the real '1', bi-polar in itself and ONE for the couple. In the man it is turned to face his feminine side, so to speak, and in the woman it face5 her masculine side. It is in this way that the Knight carries the ideal image of his Dream Princess in himself, and the Lady carries within her that of her Prince Charming. The image grows in the man with his growth, says the text of the Golden Book. But it appears only as a result of the evolution of the Personality, and consequently it can attain all its fullness only at the end of the actual development of the Personality. W hat then is this considerable conscious effort that the Knight should make, during the introspection of the second degree, in order to discover in himself-with astonishment-the idealixedimage of his Dream Princess? Through the methodical practice of introspective constatation, man manages to distinguish within himself the crust of his own Personality. In other words, through this he finds the true 'I' of his Personality. Of course, this is not his real 'I', but neither is it the false 'I' of his Personality as it appears when man is identified with his 987 little '1's plus the crust. Compared to the 987 little 'I's, the crust often takes a dominant place in the waking consciousness of man. When this dominance is very pro- nounced, it is easily perceptible; we then say of the individual that he is false, dissimulating or deformed. By liberating himself from the hold of the crust, the man becomes himself again - of course on the plane of waking consciousness, that of the 'I' of the Personality. We then say of him that he has an 'open mind'. Though there is nothing esoteric about them, these latter cases are quite rare in contemporary society. T he exercise of constatation by which man reaches this first consider- able success on the way to Know thyselfis an act ofpassive concentra- tion. However, to acquire in himself the vision of the ideal image of his polar being in this introspection of the second degree, man must practice active concentration. If, from the day that man learns about the existence of polar beings, his heart is aflame with the ardent desire to find his, he must start work without further delay. He will realize that the situation is very compli- cated to unravel. Yet he must not be discouraged, but must keep in mind St Paul's words: 'For it is God which works inyou both to will and to do of hisgood pleasure. $12 Thus, if a man, young or old, burning with a valiant heart, becomes a Knight in order to follow the Fifth Way, (the same goes for women and young girls), he must henceforth live for that alone. To this end he must cultivate a double desire: a) to merit the joy of recognizing in himself the image of his polar being, and b) to merit the joy of recognizing her when they meet. The general rule, which should be rigorously applied is: 'to attain the desired goal, it is necessary to think of it without ceasing.\"3 This is the active concentration that is needed. 10. Genesis ii: 24. 11. Ephesians v: 32. 12. Philippians ii: 13. 13. The Golden Book."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Contrary to what one may fear, this permanent exercise is not an obstacle to other exterior activities, but it even considerably augments the capacity for work. It is not difficult to understand why: this is because, from the first day that he practices this active introspective concentration, the man turns towards his real 'I7, which is the source of his life and strength, and step by step, day by day, he draws nearer to it. So let us not lose sight of the fact that the door of the Fifth Way is now wide open due to the needs of the Time of Transition, to the rapid approach of the Era of the Holy Spirit, to the accelerated incarnation of the souls attached to our planet and, lastly, to the prospect of a struggle between the two terrestrial humanities. Because of this, Knights, as well as their presumed Ladies-elect, benefit more especially from divine grace: forever united in Truth and Life, they will enter into the bosom of the Lord in order to be immediately employed on a task in His service. For today, as of old, 'the harvest truly isgreat, but the labourers are few.\"4 EPILOGUE M ore than once, in our work, we have drawn the reader's attention to the analogy that exists between the work entrusted to John the Baptist, who was the only Forerunner to Jesus, and the work that the best spirits must accomplish collectively during the present Time of Tran- sition so as to prepare for the arrival of and make possible the establish- ment of the Era of the Holy Spirit on Earth. This analogy goes very far. This is why the little knowledge that we have on the way John the Baptist carried out his mission - a mission which ended in failure-should be the object of profound meditation for all those who aspire to enter the ranks of the modern Precursor-Knights. During these meditations, we should particularly keep in mind a fact which generally passes unnoticed, which is that John the Baptist did not perform any miracles. While Jesus largely used miracles, starting with the one at the wedding at Cana in Galilee, and his Apostles followed Him closely, the Forerunner did not resort to them in any circumstance. This fact is significant. The Precursor-Knights should not count on the aid of miracles in their task. The work should be accomplished by our own abilities. This is an ultimate test to which the whole of human society is now being subjected: will it prove capable, in responding to the Lord's call, of conceiving a new elite formed of New Men, who will be able to assume the responsibility of power in all humility in order to save mankind from the Deluge of Fire which is approaching from the side of Darkness, and so ensure the advent of the Era of the Holy Spirit which, if Love is victorious, will bring to the Earth the Light, the Truth, and the Life.
