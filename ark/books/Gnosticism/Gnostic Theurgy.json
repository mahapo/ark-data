Even though separated by time, space and cultural forms, they were linked together by a common wisdom, a nexus which spans time and space to form a lineage of oral and written teaching which continue to this day. In the earliest stages of man’s present cycle we find records of this tradition in images drawn on cave walls, strange statues, enigmatic diagrams and glyphs too distant to mean much to us now. It is really only in Egypt that we start to find the first records of a fully developed esoteric system, one which I may add, still seems unique in its beauty and complexity. The school of Egypt in some sense forms the first link in a chain which spans history, it can be linked to the early esoteric traditions of the Aryans, the Tantric schools of Tartary, the fire priests of Zoroaster and the Mystery Cults of Israel. These form some of the earliest nuclei from which later esoteric traditions evolved and developed. In these forms we find some of the most complete occult systems taught and practised throughout the Millennia. Since their demise the Gnosis has continued, albeit in a different form. While these earlier civilisations offered racial and national centres of the Mysteries, the traditions that followed were, for the most part, carried by secret and clandestine bodies. Popularity when it did arrive, did not last for long and soon again they made a hasty retreat to the shadows. Certainly this was true with the Essene Gnosis as taught by Master Jesus, it was only a very short time after his Transfiguration before the true teachings could only be passed in secret, and distorted and twisted forms were offered in their stead by the military-political complex that had become the Church. Taken as a whole the Mystery teachings form what can be best understood as the “Voice of the Gnosis” and it is from this voice that ultimately all authentic esoteric teachings come. We have deliberately used the term “Voice” as it represents a living force. Far more than just an academic exercise, the Gnosis is alive, it is a life transforming vortex, it is the voice originating from a world from which mankind is utterly alienated."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 5 The teachings offered in these books may, at first glance, seem to have much in common with materials you could receive from other occult, esoteric or spiritual organisation, but there also much that is at variance. The unique thing about the Gnostic tradition is that it really comprehends the condition of modern man and his alienation from the energies which are the source of all illumination. While other traditions may have “knowledge” to offer, until they come to terms with the nature of the Cosmic battle - the Dualism which is at the centre of modern life, they cannot hope to offer real initiation or real spiritual transformation. It is not enough to have the right techniques or the latest rituals or tools, unless you know why they work and what they need to be used for. Without insight, ritualism is of little or no value. For until we know how to go beyond the things of the lower world there can be no real wisdom or development. Even if we become masters of matter, unless we have the power to escape its grip, death still arrives inevitably to the master or student. The form we have used in outlining the Gnosis is to offer the original Mystery teachings coupled with research and validation from modern sources. We believe that it is of great value to see the way in which philosophical, scientific and psychological research has validated much of what has been known for centuries within the Gnostic schools. But this, of course, has it limits. While modern psychology and science may agree with us that there are altered states of being, even perhaps other dimensions, it is only the Gnostic who realises that through “correspondence” the altered state can be used as a gateway to explore the world outside. Certainly it is also only the Gnostic who undertakes the adventure to get there. By using the master keys provided in the Gnostic and esoteric traditions and correlating these with modern research, The Institute for Gnostic Studies can offer you techniques and theories which will change the way you experience yourself and the world forever. And this, by the way, is the aim of the Gnosis, the transformation of lead into gold, man into God, the transfiguration of the student from a seeker of the Mysteries to “a partaker of the Gnosis”. In the past such experiences have remained largely unexplored, they have been dimensions only dreamed of by madman, experienced by mystics, mastered by"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 6 magicians and embodied by Avatars. However, today, as the Omega Day fast approaches, we offer the challenge of uncharted dimensions and new worlds, which can not only be explored, but used to develop undreamed of levels of post-human potential. X"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 7 What is truth ? This is a question that is central to understanding life as we know it. It is never an easy question to answer. Two thousand years ago Pilate asked Jesus the same question and it seems we haven't come much further, though society has progressed in many other ways. Gnostic Theurgy is the first of a series of volumes which have been meticulously researched to outline what we believe to be a major re-evaluation of man’s concept of Truth. While nobody can claim to have \"the whole truth\" we can claim that we have re-discovered the essential Gnosis behind the various spiritual systems as they apply to modern man. We have found enough pieces of the puzzle to offer a comprehensive understanding of what is happening behind the world of appearances. What is Truth ? What is Truth ? The best way to understand the question of Truth is to travel back to Ancient Greece and examine the allegory of the cave as used by Plato. This allegory, beyond all others, offers us a real insight into the problem of what truth is. Plato sees all of humanity as prisoners, each of us has been kept chained in a subterranean cavern from birth, facing a dark wall. Only a very small amount of light enters the cavern and this comes from a small opening high overhead. Because of our chains, we look in opposite direction and hence can only observe the dark shadows which pass along the wall we are facing. These shadows are cast by the men and occurrences of the upper world beyond the overhead opening. Our perceptions and hence of the shadows and reflections, Platos major contemplation was on what would occur if one of us escaped from the cave ? Plato’s answer is found in his work The Republic, where Socrates tells us that at first the escaped prisoner would be blinded by the strength of the light of the upper world and would retreat back to the shadows. But only for a while....."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 8 He would need, then, to grow accustomed before he could see things in that upper world. At first it would be easiest to make out shadows, and then the images of men and things reflected in water, and later on the things themselves. After that, it would be easier to watch the heavenly bodies and the sky itself by night, looking at the light of the moon and stars rather than the Sun and the Suns light in the day time...Last of all, he would be able to look at the Sun and contemplate its nature, not as it appears when reflected in water or any alien medium, but as it is in itself in its own domain....And now he would begin to draw the conclusion that it is the Sun that produces the seasons and the course of the year and controls everything in the visible world and moreover is in a way the cause of all that he and his companions used to see . Republic, Plato. 516ff. Plato, then, is illustrating for us the state of Man. His insight is clear and precise. Man is chained by his attachment to matter and his fallen condition. The only reality he sees is a reflection and forms a illusionary world around him. This is known as the Dialectic System or the World of the Archons. The true source of all things is found in the world of Ideals - the spiritual planes. In the Gnostic school these are known as the Static System or The Treasury of Light. The allegory of Plato is an important place to start as it gives us a keen understanding of mans search for meaning. Man search is a battle, a Cosmic Battle, between two distinct systems. In many traditions these two distinct systems are not only seen to be at odds with each other, but in antagonism and conflict. For if the same force that put man in chains is manipulating the reflections, then surely a battle to achieve liberation is necessary. Sometimes this battle is seen in cosmic and \"otherworldly terms\", while in others it is shown in all its bloodthirsty realism. At the same time, the battle needs to be seen in relation to why we are on earth, who or what put us here and what the goal of life is. To understand this battle, and what it means for mankind requires that we re-evaluate our beliefs and concepts. Over the years that"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 9 we have researched these volumes, we slowly came to realise that many of our generally held beliefs were actually created and sustained by a system that is totally alien to our life-stream. Accordingly, when the real truth became obvious to us it was a shock - quite a shock ! Particularly because it was so radically different from everything we had assumed was correct. I realise that starting this volume by discussing \"the battle\" will immediately turn people off. What are you talking about, you may ask ? Satan ? Demons ? UFO's ? Before we answer that you will have to study this text and reach an understanding of a new worldview, a Gnostic worldview. Preconceptions and Gnosis Preconceptions and Gnosis When we consider lanuage and knowledge, an important issue arises. The issue is that many (perhaps most) of the concepts, beliefs and mental structures mankind has are artificial, they have evolved as the \"powers that be\" would like them to evolve. Hence to really understand what we are talking about you need to put aside your pre-conceptions. Now this will be difficult, so many words have connotations which have been deliberately programmed to have us react in certain ways. We have developed certain \"understandings\" of Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Democracy, Politics etc..... all of which may or may not be true, but nevertheless all of which probably originated from the system around us, rather than from within ourselves. It is always important to realise the extent to which language can be moulded to suit different worldviews and used to create specific reactions and impressions. In some ways we might agree with the discussion in Alice in Wonderland between Humpty Dumpty and Alice... “When I use a word” Humpty Dumpty said... \"it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less\". “The question is” said Alice, “whether you can make words mean so many different things”. “The question is” said Humpty, “which is to be the Master - that's all”. Through the Looking Glass. Lewis Carroll."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 10 To appreciate the Gnostic worldview you will need to put aside your beliefs and assumptions and reconsider most of what you have been taught. It is imperative that you understand the terms we use and the context they are used in. Many of the words and concepts we present, though obviously from the language of the Christian tradition, have little or no connection to the concepts of the same name in modern Christianity ! Through our research, we have begun to reconstruct the Mystery Teachings, the inner teachings of the Gnosis. Hence, what we have discovered is very different from what the \"so called\" Christian Churches, Occult organisations and other organised religions and philosophies teach today. Now, stop for a moment and consider the fact that we have already used a number of these programmed \"buzz words\"... Christian, Church, Occult, Esoteric, Mystery teachings.. ...and each of these will trigger a certain association for you. For example, you would probably relate the term Occult to something sinister and evil, and yet the word itself simply means “hidden”. Members of the medical profession, for example, use the term occult bleeding for bleeding which comes from an unknown source. Hardly sinister or demonic I would suggest. Again and again we must emphasise that to understand and appreciate the Gnostic worldview you need to put aside the associa- tions, prejudices and pre-conceptions you have and consider new meanings for the terms that are used. It is important for you to understand the language we use in the context of how we use it, and not in terms of prevailing religious terminology. We are not asking you to just accept everything we say or blindly agree with our redefinition of old terms. What we are asking you do to is temporally suspend disbelief, enter into our Gnosis and only make a decision after you have seen the whole picture. So what do all these strange terms mean ? So what do all these strange terms mean ? The term Gnosis comes from the Greek word meaning “to know”, but it means more than “head knowledge”, it means to experience, to grasp, to “see”. Gnosis is the process through which the seeker of spiritual wisdom experiences the divine and is transformed."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 11 The teachings which make this transformation possible are considered Mystery Teachings because they embody the most ancient wisdom, the essential essence behind the worlds religious and ideological systems. In this sense they are Esoteric , eso - meaning inner, they are the inner teachings that are behind or beyond the secular, they are core religious wisdom available to the few. They are Occult in that they are secret, hidden or unknown. They are Religious in the sense that religion means “to bind back”, “to return to the source or origin”. These teachings are those which lead back to the spiritual world, the Treasury of Light from which we have become alienated. But it is perhaps desirable to state unequivocally that the teachings here, however fragmentary and incomplete, belong neither to the Hindus, the Zoroastrian, the Chaldean, nor the Egyptian religion, nor to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism or Chris- tianity exclusively.

The logical place might be at the beginning, but that opens the biggest “can of worms” within the Gnostic system. For the Gnostic, things are not as they seem and the material world is very different from that which is perceived at first examination. If we are to start at the beginning then we have to consider exactly what we are talking about. The beginning of what ? The beginning of everything, you may say, but what exactly are we discussing ? What is “everything” ? This may seem like semantics, but it is imperative that we understand what we are discussing clearly, as it forms the very foundation upon which we will build. To define what we are discussing, let us suggest that time and all related forces (such as space and matter) may be described in such a way as to form a line, on which we can define four major events. That which is before (even beyond) the framework of the line, the start of the line (the Alpha Event), the line itself and the end of the line (the Omega Point). (Fig 1). For ease, let us call this line ‘The Cosmic Timeline”. From the Gnostic understanding what which exists before and beyond the Timeline is Perfection, the Treasury of Light (we will return to this soon), the end of the Timeline is the Omega Day or the Apocalypse, the timeline itself is formed by the various stages of human development, while the Alpha Event is how time, space and matter began. It is not the point where or when everything began, but only the point Ages or Yugas. Figure One The Alpha Event The Omega Day"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 14 at which time and matter began. This is an important point as the central questions for the Gnostic are all related to the concept of time. How did the present system develop ? What caused space, time and matter ? By association what caused pain, suffering and death ? For if there is time, there is entropy and therefore there is decay, suffering and finally cessation of time or death. This Alpha event then is the major starting point for how we understand the Gnostic system, because how we perceive matter and the development of matter, influences our whole view of life and the world. The Nature of Myth The Nature of Myth One of the major problems with comprehending the truth of the Alpha Event is that in the many diverse Gnostic and religious traditions this event is presented in so many different ways and via so many different symbol-systems. On one level we may read the high-browed philosophical approach of the Greek Mysteries, and on the other, we may read about the bloody battle between \"the forces of light and darkness\" or the literal expulsion of Satan from Heaven. At first these traditions may seem disparate and it may seem advantageous to jettison one or the other depending on your own level of comprehension. However, if we examine these various traditions in more detail, we may discern a common foundation and come to the realisation that the problem is one of religious or symbolic language rather than truth. When we are teaching children about mathematics, we may discuss apples and orange, trees and coins, however, as adults we enter into the world of algebra and equations. Nobody really considers these two different approaches to be in conflict, we simply realise that a different set of metaphors are being used to explain the same essential truth. In the Gnostic tradition the same is undoubtedly true. Whether, for example, we speak of an error arising in the divine mind, an opposite appearing as a reflection of the Logos or of Satan being expelled from heaven, we are simply using different metaphors for the same cosmic event. It seems that many twentieth-century religious movements have become so locked into semantics that they end up arguing about things which are in reality, only different perspectives of the same truth."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 15 When we examine the gospels we find ample evidence for different appreciations of the divine mysteries, Jesus spends an inordinate amount of time discussing the importance of parables, and seems to delight in using stories with multiple meanings. Even the numerical descriptions of his disciples in the Gospels have such an applica- tion...there are 12 disciples, 70 outer disciples and then the multitudes. Here we have an obviously hierarchical structure. The Twelve Disciples Who are symbolic of twelve signs of the Zodiac and the twelve tribes of Israel. They may be related to the innermost teachings - The Esoteric mysteries. The Seventy Disciples Who are symbolic of the seven rays and the seven days of creation etc. They may be related to the Mesoteric or intermediate teachings. The Multitudes Who are symbolic of the Exoteric or outer teachings. To understand the Alpha Event we need to consider the various myths, legends and religious stories and deduce the essential event from behind them. Due consideration should be given to the way in which myth and legend form the language or symbol system of the Mysteries. (See Fig 2). Myths and Legends of Cosmic Error Myths and Legends of Cosmic Error In the Biblical account we read of an archangel who rebels against the cosmic order and is thrown from the heavens. His angelic nature is lost and he becomes a fallen being. His name Lucifer means light bearer and accordingly, we have a light bearer who is transformed into a dark force. This is followed by a second fall, this time directly involving humanity, where Adam and Eve, depending on interpretation, break"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 16 one of Creators commandments or in some way or another break cosmic law, and are expelled from the Garden of Eden. (In Gnostic terms the expulsion from Eden represents the Soul entering matter). There are many variantions on this theme. In some Gnostic traditions the force of the universe expands and it’s final manifesta- tion is Sophia or Wisdom. Out of a yearning to know the original Creator she gives birth to a demi-God, Ialdabaoth who in turn creates the material world. He becomes conceited and arrogant, and his creation (matter) becomes fallen and trapped within his dominion. In this legend the God of the Old testament is seen as evil and Christ is the only emissary of the light world. In another tradition Satanel (the fallen one) creates the physical world, but his creation is sterile and marred. Yahweh as the emissary of light rectifies this false creation by breathing life into shells Satanel has formed. However, the fallen world cannot be fully rectified and a mixed system of light and darkness is formed. If we wish to move into another realm of myth, we could try a modern legend.

He sets traps by showing them intricate mind patterns and they become so immersed in these patterns that they become locked inside them. As time progresses they become more and more restricted within these patterns until physical matter results. Older myths of a similar vein, but with a more “Star Wars” emphasis are found in the Veda’s, where we find quite explicit descriptions of space battles between crafts from different worlds and, perhaps even different dimensions. Each side has weapons of immense power and battle it out across space and time. There are many other records of such descriptions in the sacred Scriptures of other cultures. Each of these tales, no matter how exoteric, hides an inner truth, though the language varies, the essential core memory is the same. On a deeper level we have the Kabbalistic interpretation of how evil and matter entered the universe. When the source of all things began to evolve into multiple levels of being, a plateau was reached, at which stage the cosmic light cast a reflection, an opposite. This reflection took on a life of its own and became the negative of the positive form, this reflection became the essence we understand as evil and as a natural expansion of itself, matter was formed. Whichever myth or legend we accept (and we could continue with many from other cultures, traditions and Scriptures) the essential truth is that the Alpha Event was one of cosmic error. The line of time, space and matter should not have come into being. It is a fallen system, one which is a mixture of light and darkness, but with a tendency towards darkness. Entropy is the nature of the day, all things suffer and die. The Alpha Event caused a split in the spiritual worlds, which resulted in a division, a dualism between the higher and lower worlds, (the subject of study three) and the higher and lower bodies (the subject of study four). The Alpha Event forms the central pivot of the Gnostic worldview. If matter is an error and “The Particles of Light” or Souls are locked within it, then we can begin to comprehend the duality between matter and spirit, mind and body, Light and Darkness. We can appreciate why the ruling force of the universe is entropy and why all things decay and die. It also offers us a unique view of history and the state of humanity in general."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 18 Matter Contra Spirit Matter Contra Spirit Matter and spirit are in conflict. In contradiction to modern wholistic philosophy the Gnostic has always known there is a struggle at the core of human experience. Whether we consider the Biblical view of flesh battling Spirit or the cosmic dualism of the Zoroastrians (where Ahura Mazda and Ahriman battle across the universe), the essential truth is that matter and spirit do not work well together. While man’s physical existence accelerates and his technology reaches greater and greater heights, the cost has been great, far greater than may be first appreciated. We may tend to believe that evolution has dragged man from the primeval waters of earth and slowly transformed him into the half-divine animal he presently is. But what of his spirit, his “Light Self”, at what point did he “lose his Soul”. Human history can be categorised in lots of different ways, there are systems which divide history into seven, eight, even thirty or forty periods depending on what perspective of history is taken. For our purposes it is interesting to compare the traditional evolutionary or technological model of history with the Yuga system of the early Veda’s The early Vedic system divided history into four ages or Yugas. The system itself is in some sense Gnostic, as it positions the most cultivated age of man as the first, and the most brutal as the last. The Sanskrit names for the four ages are Krita or Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga. These can also be correlated to the Greek tradition of dividing history into ages of Gold, Silver, Bronze and Iron. The Krita Yuga is the Golden Age, the age of Spirit and from there onwards things get successively worse until the Kali age, which ends in an apoca- lypse of water and fire. The evolutionary or technological worldview sees human life from a materialistic angle. Life has evolved from amoeba to human, becoming more and more complex with related advances in culture and technology. When two worldviews as juxtaposi- tioned and considered in the light of the Alpha Event, some interesting things come to our attention."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 19 If we decided to draw a chart using the vertical bar to represents degrees of matter and spirit, matter in the lower corner, spirit in the higher, and we use the horizontal bar to represent the flow of time, the conflict between matter and spirit becomes obvious. (See Fig 3) While the golden age of Spirit was occurring in the higher worlds, matter was only just beginning to bubble and burst in the amoebic stew. As matter evolved further and further, spirit in inverse proportion has had less and less influence. As we reach towards the end of our hypothetical timeline (the Omega Point), matter has reached it highest pinnacle, while spirit is at its lowest ebb. If you doubt the validity of the comparison, turn on your television and watch the “News at Seven” and weep. The Alpha Event explains why there is an ongoing battle between spirit and matter and why they work in inverse proportions. It also explains the “grand plan” behind nature itself. Since nature is the result of the Alpha Event, we should be able to see tell-tale signs within the very mechanism of nature itself to suggest its malevolent goals and its antipathy to spirit. The Nature of Nature The Nature of Nature The only reliable thing about nature is its cycle of suffering, decay and death. Now I know that it is said that while nature is cyclic, one thing dies and another is reborn, but that is the point. One thing dies, another is reborn. There is no individual or discrete permanence, all is transition. This is the great truth Gautama Buddha pronounced 2,500 years ago and it stands the test of time. Human life as a whole is sometimes considered negative entropy, but even this is only real, if you consider physical matter as your point of reference. If you take into account violence, standards of living, conditions of the earth and so forth mankind’s effect has certainly been one of destruction, not evolution. Genes and Memes can also come into this argument. Our genes program us to reproduce and this has a direct relation to jealousy, violence, territorialism and arguably most of the ills our civilisation experiences. Even the battle between the sexes has a genetic basis, and there is a value (to nature at least) keeping men at war, when only the best survive and hence only the best stock reproduces. Accordingly, good genes continue and nature is pleased. Now I realise there is a lot of debate about nature versus nurture, however, the fact is that humanity is manipulated by its genetic programming. If we add to this our under-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 20 standing of the Alpha Event, then this programming is at the worst malefic, at its best, unsavoury. If we extend this argument to include Memes then it becomes even more relevant. Memes are the mental equivalent to Genes, it is argued that idea’s can exist in the collective unconscious of humanity and influence and affect large numbers of people, nations and countries. Accordingly, if we accept the hypothesis that Genes are fulfilling the programming of a cosmic error, even a “destructive entity or being” (Okay, lets not go too far), then we can extend this to see how Memes condition the thinking of humanity and create the 'isms' and 'ologies' that curtail the possibly of real spiritual development, awakening or realisation. Nature, in itself, probably cannot be considered ethically evil, it is, however, fallen - designed in error, and therefore a mixture of Light and Darkness.

Humanity can critically reason beyond genes and memes, beyond the Archons, beyond the Alpha Event and return to the higher spiritual worlds. This means that mans error cannot be excused. He must awaken himself and achieve a rectification of the scheme of things. This rectification, however, can only occur after the nature of the system has been truly compre- hended. The scheme of things in the Gnostic worldview, however, goes far beyond the physical, or for that matter even the mental. If we accept the hypothesis that other dimensions, planes, even worlds exist, then there must be hierarchies of fallen and unfallen denizens. Worlds that exist beyond time and space, and worlds trapped in the mesh of matter. These worlds may be populated, there may be other streams of life, some waiting to help mankind, to liberate him from this prison while others, perhaps, more malefic to the human lifestream, may wish to keep him in bondage. These other realities, then, are the subject of our next chapter. X"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 22 When considering the esoteric traditions regarding man and the universe it is sometimes difficult to “get a handle” on what these various planes, dimensions and worlds really mean. At times the ancient tabulations can seem more like “counting the angels on the head of a pin” than anything of real practical value. However, in the twentieth century as research into holography and light revealed many secrets, these ancient traditions suddenly began to make a lot more sense. In this lesson and the one following we are going to examine both the ancient and modern basis for a multi- dimensional model of the universe and man. The scientific basis for this understanding is found in what we call “The Refraction Model of Reality”. The Refraction Model of Reality The Refraction Model of Reality The Refraction Model is based on the simple observation of what occurs when light is refracted through a prism. If a light is shone through a prism the result is a spectrum of colour. (Fig 4). The ancient Gnostics used the rainbow as a symbol for the multi-faceted nature of the universe, and when we consider the refraction model we can see why. In simple terms, the earthly image of the refraction of light glyphs or symbolises something more refined. On a spiritual level, we can contemplate the Primal Light shining through the prism or matrix of manifestation to create the various dimensions of the scheme of things which now exist. In theological terms the “First Cause” energises the Logos or the Word (the Matrix) and the multi-faceted universe results. In this model we can see three distinct stages:"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 23 1. The Source of Energy. 2. The Matrix. 3. The Resulting Spectrum. This can be applied to many different levels of spiritual reality. From a universal perspective it can be seen as a way to understand how the seven planes of existence are formed and how the One becomes the many. When considering humanity our model is even more expressive, energy is received into the mind/brain complex (the Matrix) and it is distributed through the sevenfold systems in the organism. These systems vary depending on the form of energy received, we have the seven states of consciousness, the seven Chakras or, on a more physical level, the seven phases of the endocrine system and related physiological structures. Ramifications of the Refraction Model Ramifications of the Refraction Model When we begin to contemplate this model we can start to see how eloquent it really is. The first consideration is what variations can be made to effect the spectrum’s results. Two answers come to mind: Fig 4 1. Source of Energy 2. The Matrix. 3. The Resulting Spectrum"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 24 1. The quantity and/or quality of the Light Source. 2. The quality of the Matrix. On a simple level, these straight-forward answers are pregnant with truth. As we shall show later if you vary the quality or quantity of the energy, the spectrum itself suffers. Accordingly, since we know that in the lower worlds the spiritual light we receive is actually a mixture of positive and negative forces, then we can understand how our experience of reality is influenced and conditioned through the energy we receive. If we go further and contemplate how the brain/mind complex is pro- grammed with painful memories and neuroses, we can appreciate how energy distributed from the spiritual worlds can be distorted by flaws in the Matrix. We can also see how the resulting spectrum (our emotional/physical reality) is condi- tioned and influenced by variations in our ourselves (the Matrix) and the energy we receive. From the refraction model we can be already deduce some of the basic tasks of Esoteric Technology.. 1. To assure that only the highest quality Light is received. 2. To refine and purify the Matrix. We will return and consider these issues again later in our lessons, especially when we come to consider the effect of having two sources of light and giving due consideration to the Alpha Event. For now, let us return to our model and examine how it can be applied to dimensions and worlds. Flatland Flatland If we accept the Refraction Model, then we can theorise that the universe is multi-dimensional and probably has various levels of existence. If we consider this for a moment and ponder how “real” our dimension seems to us, then perhaps other"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 25 levels would be perceived as concrete and real as our own from from within their own vantagepoint. This very concept was the basis of a fascinating story written by Edwin.A.Abbott in 1884 called “Flatland”. Originally published under the pseudonym of Mr.A.Square, it was found to be the work of an English clergyman and Shake- spearean scholar, whose fascination with mathematics led him to publish this tale. The importance of Flatland is that it helps us conceptualise the possibility of altered dimensions from the perspective of geometry. Now, I am not Edwin Abbott and hence, I cannot paraphrase his story in a way he would appreciate, but I can give you the gist of the tale. (I would also suggest you go a buy a copy, it has been reprinted by Dover Books and is available in a very economical edition). Imagine a world of only two dimensions, a world of beings who only know “across and side to side” and have no knowledge whatsoever of up and down. These entities live in a diverse world of squares, triangles, circles as well as many other “nationalities”. They live in a world much like our own, except for one thing, they are flat. Imagine one day Mr.Square enters his flat home, walks across to his flat lounge and sits down (however that is possible in two dimensions) and begins to read an even flatter book. Suddenly a voice comes to him from another dimension, this voice is actually coming from Mr.Jones, a traveller from the dimension of Up, but Mr.Square does not know this. Mr.Square cannot see him because Up does not exist for Mr.Square, all he experiences is a loud bellowing, but disembodied voice. Mr.Square, by now obviously terrified, demands that this being makes himself known to him. Mr.Jones with the aim to oblige and enter into inter-dimensional communica- tion, lowers himself towards the ground in Mr.Square's home. Mr.Square cannot see the totality of Mr.Jones, all he sees is the points and lines of Mr.Jones body where they connect to the two dimensional lines of his lounge room. Mr.Square comes quickly to the conclusion that he is communicating with a weird selection of lines and points. From this conclusion he decides he is either quite mad or that he has had a little too much to drink from his flat bottle of Gin. Mr.Jones is not happy, he does not like to be thought of as a weird and disjointed collection of lines and points. He grasps Mr.Square on his two dimensional shirt and lifts him into the air. Mr.Square is ecstatic and very confused, where is he ? He has no"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 26 idea of the dimension of Up and hence cannot understand the experience, as he begins to hover above the ground he see his friends below, but they cannot see him. However, as he returns to his two-dimensional world, at the moment of contact he re-appears, seemingly out of nowhere. He tries to explain but how can they understand dimensions beyond their two dimensional perception ? This tale illustrates the hypothesis of other dimensions, if we attempt to translate a cube into two dimensions we know that what we arrive at, is nothing but a reflection or an approximation. We know that in a cube all lines are of the same length, yet, in a two dimensional representation, the length of the lines seem to vary. According to modern Geometry if we take a cube and apply it into a further dimension we arrive at what is known as a “Tesseract”. This cannot be illustrated as it exists in four dimensions, all we can see is its reflection as a cube inside a cube. Theoretically, however, we know it exists ! Giving some consideration to this tale we may begin to hypothesise about various planes, dimensions, worlds or orders of existence. If we project our cube into higher dimensions, we can create an infinite progression until we reach some final point of conclusion. If we combine this understanding with our Refraction Model we can come to see that there must be multiple levels of existence. In the ancient traditions this has been known for a long time, and depending on the esoteric tradition, the number of these planes is either four or seven. Worlds and Planes Worlds and Planes The Gnostic tradition tends to use two systems of structuring the universe, a sevenfold system (derived from the Rosicrucian tradition) and an older fourfold system (derived from the Kabbalah). Both interlock and work well in combination. Together these systems illustrate the multi-dimensional nature of reality, the earth is only the base plane from which other realities are hidden. There can be many views of such a structure, ranging from alternative dimensions and discrete planes to multiple time tracks, each has their place in our understanding. (Fig 5) Even if we wish to consider that the descriptions of Gods, Archangels and Angels as outmoded,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 27 they can still be interpreted as symbolic of other life streams which operate within these alternate realities. To get a more comprehensive picture we should discuss each plane in detail. The Divine Plane The Divine Plane This is the point of origin, the matrix from which all universal systems evolve. It is the plane of Kether in the Kabbalah and on a more tangible level, the dimension from which the source of light originates. This is the goal for those on the Celestial Path. The Seven Planes.

Accordingly there are destructive as well as constructive Arch Angels, Demons as well as Angels and fallen spirits as well as human spirits.

From this plane the True Self (Yechidah) or the Pneumatic Light Self operates in the present cycles, though in most of humanity it is in a embryonic form only. In the cycles of creation this is the plane from which polarisation and differentiation originates. It is on this level that the Seven Rays regulate the cycles of creation. The Divine Plane and the Plane of the Virgins Spirits are equivalent to the World of Atziluth in the Kabbalistic Fourfold structure. The Plane of Divine Spirit The Plane of Divine Spirit This plane is also known as the Spiritual Plane. It is the plane of archetypal forms, and is the location from which energies from the upper planes are condensed and radiated into the lower. This is the plane on which the Immortals exist. This is the goal for those on the Terrestrial Path. The Plane of the Life Spirit The Plane of the Life Spirit This plane is also known as the Intuitional Plane. It is the dimension where the forces and archetypes take creative solidity and manifest. On a human level, it is the dimension of high level intuition and cosmic awareness. The Plane of the Divine Spirit and the Plane of the Life Spirit are equivalent to the Kabbalistic world of Briah. Traditionally the Alpha Event caused the fall of everything below the world of Atziluth. The worlds of Briah, Yetzirah and Assiah all contain mixtures of light and darkness. However, it is in the Desire and the physical planes that the Dialectic has gained the most influence. The Plane of Thought The Plane of Thought This is also known as the Mental Plane.

In some traditions it is also seen as the reflective sphere or Astral light. The division between the Thought and Desire Plane is not as clear as it seems and intermingling occurs between them both, the lower reaches of both planes are nearly totally Dialectally controlled. The Planes of Thought and Desire are equivalent to the Kabbalistic World of Yetzirah. The Physical Plane is the Kabbalistic World of Assiah, the fallen world of Matter. Now I realise these descriptions are far from satisfactory, however it is very difficult to define alternate realities without reference to other subjects which we have not covered as yet. Since the Gnostic system is self referencing, we have a situation where each truth is dependant on an understanding of others. So please be patient, as you study more and learn more about the nature of man, the Kabbalah, Chakras and other related subjects, you will gain more insight into how all these fields relate and you will slowly be able to appreciate the developing Gnostic worldview. Now, you will remember that at our last study we drew seven parallel lines, diagrammatical, illustrating the seven Kosmic ele- ments, in which work the seven Kosmic Forces of Principles - the energy-consciousness side of Being. Please note this evening carefully that these Elements, the Kosmical Elements are worlds. Call them planes if you like, but really they are worlds. I do not mean globes, necessarily, that is, solid spherical bodies. They are around and in globes, yet they are truly worlds, spheres of action, spheres of consciousness; and each one of these Kosmical Ele- ments, in addition to being a world, is infilled with its own humanities, countless, numberless, innumerable, beyond all hu- man computation.

Leary is best known for his infamous psychedelic research in the Sixties, and subsequent battles with the law. However, less known is his research into the fields of personality and altered states. Prior to his dismissal from Harvard University in 1963 he was considered an “up and coming” light in personality typing and his Masters degree paper “The interpersonal diagnosis of personality” is still considered a classic in the field. In 1971 Leary published “The Politics of Ecstasy” in which he outlined a sevenfold structure of personality as related to fields of activity or streams of consciousness. These can be easily referenced to the seven planes. Leary’s system is interesting in that it offers a unconventional perspective of the Seven planes, his starting point is Void (Body and Flesh) and the highest plane is seen as the White Light, existing on an atomic level. His under- standing while based on a scientific model focusing on levels of matter has at the same time a transcendent characteristic. The Directing Intelligence is for Leary the focal point for the given reality, while the Communication Centre offers the distribution point for the given state of consciousness. For example, the brain is the Directing Intelligence on its level, while it’s distribution network is through the sense organs. The descriptions of Science and Religion give us an inkling of the deeper nature of each level of consciousness. For example, Leary’s description of how Buddhism relates to the Atomic state is quite informative.. Buddhism attempts to transcend life and cellular manifestations and to arrive at the White Light of the Void, the unitary atomic-electronic flash beyond form. While on the emotion level Leary describes the religious imagery as “middle class Catholicism and devil oriented fundamentalism which are based on the arousal of emotion and fear”. In connection with each state Leary gives a range of correspon- dences. To give you some idea of his system we have included a selection of same.

When we think back to what we have discussed about the “cosmic error”, we can summarise it in terms of the creation or action of a secondary spiritual source. In the Gnostic interpretation of the Biblical myth for example, we have the defection of Lucifer and a battle between Michael and Satan, which results in the creation of matter. In the Zoroastrian model we have Ahura Mazda, the Lord of Light, and the secondary force as Ahriman. Depending on the period, the Zoroastrian model varies, sometimes we have Spenta Mainyu battling Ahriman, other times we have a more “warrior” version of Ahura Mazda doing battle, however, the duality is still the same. If we decide to use the Biblical mythology for its symbolic value, we would arrive at a structure like that seen illustrated in Fig 6. What is interesting about this structure is that if we spent a little time and some imagination, it can be readily translated into terms of light and relations between objects. When we undertake such an interpolation we find we have all the elements for the creation of a hologram. (Fig 7). While I agree our religious imagery may only reveal the holographic elements in Fig 6 Source Michael Satanel Cosmic Battle creates Matter The Alpha Event or Cosmic Battle in the mythological terms The Alpha Event or Cosmic Battle in the mythological terms of the Old Testament and related Gnostic Traditions. of the Old Testament and related Gnostic Traditions."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 33 a very simplistic and elementary form, it is nevertheless certainly present. If we go further and re-consider the early religious mythologies about the fall and the creation of matter in the light of Holography it becomes even more obvious. Holograms are made by exposing a piece of film to laser light, which is scattered by the object being holographed. The film is also exposed to light coming directly from the laser (the reference beam). The two beams of light interfere when they reach the film because they have taken different paths and are no longer in phase with each other. The film simply records this interference pattern, which is the hologram. To reconstruct (view) the image, the hologram is illuminated by a beam of light, which is diffracted by the interference pattern on the film. This reproduces the original surface pattern of the object in three dimensions. Encarta Encyclopaedia, Microsoft . (Fig 7 © Microsoft)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 34 The three dimensional image of the hologram is created before our eyes in space by two beams of coherent light. The waves overlap standing wave patterns over a certain region of space which subtract and add to the light field. Our consciousness sees the image as real even though there is nothing solid in space. One can put one hands through the the image which looks like a real object. The image is created entirely by interactions of light distributing (the field of the knower) - consciousness. Nuclear Evolution, Christopher Hills. University of the Trees Press, 1968. In very simple terms (very unscientific I am afraid), the addition of a secondary force to our Refraction Model creates a hologram. A hologram which symbolises the illusionary nature of matter because it shows that matter is not real or stable. Using the terms of holography we could say that “matter is interference in the pattern of spirit”. From this we can begin to see how the Alpha Event fits into our model. However, there is more, since the Alpha Event changed the quality of our energy source, it also changed the resulting spectrum - we now have reality as a hologram, a mirage or illusion. This hologram, in terms of the esoteric tradition, contaminated the planes and caused the lowest reaches of the Desire Plane to become what we know as “physical”. It also caused a breach in the spiritual world, and formed what is known in Gnosticism as The Great Schism. The Great Schism The Great Schism The Church teaches that God is the source of all perfect and that the whole world, visible and invisible, is His creation. Yet one does not need to be a philosopher to observe that in this world of ours moral and physical evil - suffering, cruelty, decay, death - is abundantly present.

The world is the work of lowly powers which though they may mediately be descended from Him do not know the true God and obstruct the knowledge of Him in the cosmos over which they rule. The genesis of these lower powers, the Archons (rulers), and in general that of all of the Orders of being outside God, including the world {Physical} itself, is the main theme of Gnostic specula- tion....The universe, the domain of the Archons is like a vast prison whose innermost dungeon is the earth, the scene of mans life. Around and above it the cosmic spheres are ranged like concentric enclosing shells. Most frequently there are seven spheres of the planets surrounding by the eighth that of the fixed stars.... The religious significance of this cosmic architecture lies in the idea that everything which intervenes between here and the be- yond serves to separate from God, not merely by spatial distance but by active demonic force. Thus the vastness and multiplicity of the cosmic system express the degree to which man is removed from God.....The Archons collectively rule over the world and each individually in his sphere is a warder of the cosmic prison. Their tyrannical world-rule is called Hiemarmene, universal Fate.....[This universal fate] aims at the enslavement of man. As guardian of his sphere each Archon bars the passage to the souls that seek to ascend after death, in order to prevent their escape from the world and their return to God.

Beacon Press, 1963."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 36 The early Gnostics understood the world in terms of the Alpha Event, or in more religious terms, the fall of man, and accordingly divided reality into two distinct realms. To understand this relevance of this division we have to consider various issues. Before this event, man was in communication with the Pleroma and existed in a spiritual dimension where there was no death and suffering. At this stage the particles of light were in union with Spirit for there was no conflict. After the Alpha Event, all this changed, the lower worlds were decimated and man was banished to a world of matter. This is how death and suffering entered the system. Mankind lost communication with the higher spiritual principles and descended into the coils of matter. This change transformed the very essence of the earth stream, a chasm was created between the spiritual and material worlds, and man became the centre of the Cosmic Battle. While certainly the material world in its beauty still reflects the nature of Light, in its transience and pain, it reflects the fact that it has fallen and is under the dominion of Darkness. Since the spiritual worlds are under the Laws of Light and the fallen worlds are under the Laws of Darkness, there is an immense barrier between man and the higher worlds. (Fig 8).

The intermediate planes are mixed in their characteristics and while under dialectic law are comprised of both light and dakrness. The highest spiritual worlds are governed by Static Laws. Man is in the centre of the battle between these two orders or hierarchies, each with its own related hierarchies and powers. It is important to understand the extent to which the Dialectic powers extend. When the lifestream fell, it took with it the spiritual worlds. Accordingly, the spiritual sphere surrounding the earth is an amalgam of good and evil forces. For even though the earth receives emanations of light, it is under the dominion of the Dialectic masters, these Dialectic masters or rulers are known as The Archons. These Archons have great power, which extends from the astral shield surrounding the earth far into the spiritual dimensions. The lower world even attempts to duplicate the higher spiritual planes within its own fallen astral realities, offering a false kingdom for the unwary. A superb description of these “false seven planes” is found in the Gnostic Gospel of Mary, where we read about the inner dimension of the fourth power, or in our terms the four elements. When the soul had overcome the third power, it went upwards and saw the fourth power which took seven forms. The first form is darkness, the second desire, the third ignorance, the fourth is the excitement of death, the fifth is the kingdom of the flesh, the sixth is the foolish wisdom of the flesh and the seventh is the wrathful wisdom. These are the seven powers of Wrath. It is also interesting to note that the magicians who designed the Planetary Kamea’s or Talismans knew this very well. Each planet had a Spirit and an Intelligence, a Light side and a Dark Side, a force of Light and a fallen vortex. When we apply our understanding of this Schism to our model of the planes and worlds, we begin to get an accurate representation of the state of the universe. (Fig 9)"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 39 We can see how the lower planes are in a constant state of conflict, though Light forces exist in the lower worlds they are under the dominion of the Archons and are, accordingly, for all intents and purposes held captive. This brings so much meaning to the following quote from the book of Ephesians. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against princi- palities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Ephesians 6;12 (The King James Version) Bringing the Strands together Bringing the Strands together This study is a difficult one and it will take time to connect things together. The theoretical basis is that there are multiple levels of being and to illustrate this we have used the Refraction Model. When this model is analysed we can see how the variables explain the various errors which the Alpha Event caused. When we consider the change in the quantity and quality of the source of Light and the flaws created in human consciousness by the Alpha Event, the model proves very workable. Prior to the Alpha Event the Seven Planes were all spiritual, and represented degrees of spiritual essence and the spectrum existed as variations within the Light field. However, the Alpha Event added a second power into the equation (and polluted the Matrix to boot) which radically altered the structure of the universe. Matter was formed, and a schism or split was created between the worlds. The creation of matter can be seen as the creation of a hologram, an illusion so real that the human lifestream was deceived by it. Further, the schism created a warzone where two schemes, two Lifestreams, two hierarchies now battle each other through time and space. The World of the Archons includes a mixture of light and darkness, but is ruled by the fallen forces.

X"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 41 There are many different ways we can understand the universe and man. The Refraction and Holographic Models are one series of analogies which prove of value. While certainly not the only symbol systems (science is as much a symbol system as religion), they certainly prove effective when used to explain complex spiritual realities. It is intriguing to note that the refraction model becomes more and more meaningful as we move from the higher realms to the lower, when we apply it to the nature of earth and man it is particularly expressive. The Nature of Earth The Nature of Earth In the Refraction Model we noticed two major variants in relation to the conditioning of the Spectrum or end result. These were: 1. The quantity and/or quality of the Light Source. 2. The quality of the Matrix. If we apply these to the earth to create a Terrestrial Refraction Model we find: 1. Physical and spiritual energies received from the Solar Logos. 2. Variants in the quality of the Earth Logos (Gaia). The Sun provides spiritual and physical energy which sustains and destroys all life on earth. The heat of the Sun can bring about the maturing of crops and stimulate life, while at the same time, it can also cause men to die of heat exhaustion and create"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 42 deserts. The Solar Logos (to which we will devote a lesson later) is the doorway through which both Static and Dialectic currents enter our System. Accordingly, the earth receives varying amounts of positive and negative energies. In addition to the Solar vortex, there are other sources of energy which emanate into our system, however as we wish to keep the model simple, and since their effect is not significant at this point, we will ignore them for the moment. To say the earth is a living system is not unusual. Whether we contemplate the old occult concept that the earth has a “soul” or the modern “new age” theology of Gaia, we can readily appreciate that the earth is a complex living system. In esoteric terminology, the earth is a Logos and forms the Matrix which receives and relays energies from the Solar Sphere. Since these energies are both of a positive and negative nature, so too is Mother Earth. The Gnostic tradition maintains that the essential earth Logos is a light force (even in some traditions Sophia herself) which has been locked in an outer physical cage or prison. This is where the Gnostic concept of earth is radically different from “earth religions”, to worship the earth is to worship a cage, to be subservient to the earth is to risk annihilation. The earth is a living field, but like everything else on the physical plane, it is in a state of flux and drifts between light and darkness. The Earth Logos receives mixed energy currents from the Solar Sphere and transmits them to the earth system. (Fig 10) The body or form of the earth is covered by a Fig 10 + -"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 43 grid-like pattern of energy lines. These lines (like acupuncture points on the human body) relay the energies received and condition the physical and psychic environments on the earth’s surface. In addition to these lines there are seven earth Chakras which, in some sense, mirror the Chakras which exist on the human body. These Chakras form the spectrum of earth and radiate the prevailing physical and psychic environment through the dimensions and fields which surround the earth sphere. The form of earth is both physical and psychic, the grids exists on both physical and magnetic-astral levels and the environments created are both physical and psychic. As the earth forces change, so do weather patterns, vitality of the earth, continental plates and electro- magnetic thought fields. These thought fields also known as “Eggregores” influence nations, multitudes and individuals and work as a sort of “collective thought-control” to sustain the prevailing state of the earth field and related Lifestreams. (See our discussion on Memes). Man lives in interdependence with these fields and interacts with them, whether consciously or unconsciously. As man pollutes and destroys the environment both physically and mentally, he influences the nature of the earth grid, which in turn, influences the energies received. In turn, man is influenced by the earth grid and man’s ability to receive and utilise the solar currents is conditioned. This symbiotic cycle continues as man and earth influence each other. As the Kali Yuga accelerates, the fallen systems tend towards destructiveness and both earth and man receive more and more negative energy. In turn, this negativity influences the system as a whole exponentially. The net result is a steady decline towards the Omega Day. The Inter-Dimensional Nature of Man The Inter-Dimensional Nature of Man The Refraction Model can also be applied to the nature of man, and helps us understand the reality which we experience. The human organism receives the negative and positive solar currents and radiates them through the matrix of being. In the human form this matrix varies depending on the level we are discussing, but is generally related to the brain-mind complex. As these energies are received, they are filtered by the programs inherent within the brain-mind and distributed through a variety of “spectrums” or septenary systems. For example, on the physical level there are seven “brain-circuits” and seven phases of the endocrine system. On the spiritual dimension"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 44 man has seven Chakras or psychic centres and seven levels of consciousness. Probably most important of all is the seven bodies or dimensions of man’s nature. Each of these systems influence the others and each is influenced by the variants within the energies received and variants within the Matrix. As the brain-mind complex forms the Matrix within the human system, then memory complexes, neuroses and thought patterns can radically influence both the energies received and the resulting state of being on all levels. As mankind lurches towards the end of the cycle, then the energies radiated into each individual become more and more contaminated and a greater effort is required to extract the light from the mixture. This in some sense is the individual nature of the Cosmic Battle. The task for the Gnostic in the Kali Yuga is to extract the light from the energies received and to sustain the purity of the Human Matrix, this is no easy task. When we begin to discuss the bodies or dimensions of man it becomes imperative that we really understand what man really is. In the early Hebrew esoteric traditions on which the Bible is based, man is a complex being. He is composed of multiple bodies or levels, each of which represent a specific strata of activity within his nature and each of which has a differing origin and goal. The structure of man is basically fourfold, as is the custom with the Hebrew system, and is related to the four worlds and the four letters of the Tetragrammaron or secret formula of God (YHVH). (See Fig 11) The Guph The Guph The Guph is the physical body and related electro-magnetic fields. It has no innate immortality and returns to the earth at death. (In pre-fall man the Guph was simply an electro-magnetic extension of the higher bodies with no related physical form). The Nephesh The Nephesh The Nephesh is roughly defined as the instinctual bodies. It can be divided into upper and lower forms and these could be related to the Astral and the Etheric bodies. These levels are the energy fields which invigorate and control the physical and psychic organism and relay commands from the mental complex (Ruach)."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 45 The Ruach The Ruach The Ruach is the mental complex or mind.

The Chiah and Neschamah The Chiah and Neschamah As deeper facets of the Ruach, the Chiah and Neschamah form the unconscious framework of the psyche. These may be related to the Animus and Anima of Jungian Psychology and represent the deepest levels of the personal unconscious, where the dualities of force and form, male and female and body and mind originate. The Yechidah The Yechidah The Yechidah is the immortal part of man, which in his fallen state does not come into action naturally. The average human experiences life through his instincts (the soul) and through his mind (Ruach) and constructs a little sense of self from these experiences.

Ultimately then, cessation of existence, after a cycle of lives and many lost opportunities, becomes the end for most of humanity. When man descended into the fallen world of matter, he lost his right to immortality and hence became truly mortal. His true self, which had evolved through many cycles, was contaminated by the fall and could not survive in his now degenerated state. Accordingly, his Yechidah or self became powerless, locked in a fallen vehicle and could exist only as a spark of light - a potential. The only way to reactivate this Self is by the application of the Mysteries found on the Path of Transfiguration. This Transfigurative process involves a spiritual technology whereby man is reborn through the power of the Treasury of Light, and the Ruach is united with the re-awakened Yechidah. The Yechidah, using the energies of the Ruach and Nephesh is re-developed, and the True Self is revealed. The mixed impersonal current which invigorates the fallen system is transmutated, and the individual manifests as an eternal, discrete, identity reflecting the glory of the Pleroma. So, yes man is mortal, but there is hope, there is an opportunity for immortality. It is imperative to realise that immortality is conditional, man has no right to live forever. His post fall constitution is by nature mortal and contaminated. Only by the power of The Treasury of Light can man be changed into a immortal form which reflects the majesty and beauty of the Pleroma. Now you have a fairly clear picture of the basic elements of man. However, as we study further you will find that a more comprehensive and descriptive understanding is required. Just like we offered you the Kabbalistic structure of the Four Worlds and these were expanded into Seven Planes, so too the four bodies can be expanded into seven. These can be easily correlated to the traditional four bodies, but give offer more detail.

Reincarnation is a concept that can be found at the heart of all of the great esoteric systems of the world. Indeed, it can be found at the heart of most religions. In the early Christian Church there were many who taught the doctrine of reincarnation. Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Jerome, Gregoras, Augustine and Irenaeus to name but a few. It was only during the Council of Nicea in 325 AD that the concept of reincarnation became unpopular. This disavowal was coupled with the development of new teachings regarding the Trinity, eternal hellfire and Purgatory that were imported into the Church for political reasons by Emperor Constantine. It was only in AD 553 at the Second Council of Constantinople that the Church finally and formally condemned the doctrine of reincarnation. In both Hinduism and Buddhism reincarna- tion is a central doctrine. In the Bhagavad Gita, we find Krishna expounding the theory of reincarnation to Arjuna, a wise and powerful warrior. The fascinating thing about this dialogue is its emphasis on spiritual action. Krishna tells does not tell Arjuna to abandon the battle and retire to a monastery, but to return and fight and even die, if the need be, fighting with detachment born of his knowledge of reincarnation. “Both I and thou have passed through many births”, Krishna tells Arjuna on the battlefield. In Buddhism reincarnation is also taught, but with a difference. Buddhist tradition maintains that there is no soul or immortal essence, only environmental factors (Sanskaras) which repeat life after life, re-creating a semblance of identity in each incarnation. In Ancient Egypt the followers of Amen-Ra derived their belief in reincarnation from the course of the sun. As it died in the West and rose again in the East at dawn, so the vital forces sank into the underworld to rise again in a different body. Hermes, the great Master of the Mysteries, was one of the earliest Egyptian priests to openly proclaim the once secret teaching of reincarnation."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 51 If a soul, when it has entered the body persists in evil, it does not taste the fruits of life eternal, but is dragged back again, it reverses its course and takes its way back to creeping things and that ill fated soul, having failed to know itself, lives in servitude to noxious and uncouth bodies, in this doom are vicious souls condemned. Hermes. While we may not agree to the extent he has taken the concept of reincarnation, this quote does illustrate his acceptance of the doctrine. Turning to ancient Greece we find a very old tale, a story of Proteus, who could change his shape at will. When an old man attempted to grab him, hoping to ascertain his real form, Proteus was sleeping as a stone. On being touched he became a plant, when approached again he became a serpent and then transformed into a man and finally a spirit, at which time he flew off into the sky. Here we clearly have a classical myth being used to outline the esoteric teaching of reincarnation as taught within the Greek traditions. The Zohar, a Hebrew mystical and Kabbalistic text, tells us that all souls must undergo reincarnation and that the souls of men revolve like a stone that is thrown from a sling that has been spun many times before finally being let go. Those souls that have reached perfection stay in their holy places, only those which have not completed their perfection are subject to the wheel of reincarnation or Gilgul. The Truth about Reincarnation The Truth about Reincarnation At first this may all seem very heartening, however, if we examine the subject closer we find that the Gnostic view of reincarnation has little in common with the version of reincarnations commonly found in the various faiths. It probably would be correct to say that all they have in common is that “something” reincarnates. In the systems of “pop reincarnation” (so prevalent in new age circles today) reincarnation is seen as some sort of evolutionary process whereby human beings slowly get better and better over long periods of time and many lives. “Pop reincarnation” also seems to suggest that all of humanity will achieve the final goal, even if it takes some individuals much longer than others. The Gnostic view of reincarnation is totally at variance with this. For the Gnostic the fall into matter was a cosmic error, not part of some grand plan and accordingly, reincarnation is not a phase of the universal evolutionary scheme, but an"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 52 emergency measure. The reason for reincarnation is to offer souls an opportunity to enter the spiritual path, a chance for Transfiguration. Certainly, there is an evolution- ary process involved, but this occurs after one has entered the spiritual path, not before. The general trend within the lower world is towards decay and dissolution and that is certainly illustrated in humanity. If we have been evolving through reincarna- tion for millennia why don’t we see any signs of man’s great “spiritual” evolution. Another problem with the whole concept of reincarnation is that many suppose it continues eternally and that everyone is at some point reconciled. This is a strange and unusual adaptation of the theory, and not one found in any of the earlier esoteric traditions. The whole gist of reincarnation in earlier esotericism is that it is a “weeding process” whereby the awakened achieve immortality and the rest cease to exist. This approach abounds in myth and legend - the twelve labours of Hercules, the search for the Holy Grail, the quest for the Golden Fleece - all are focused on a tribulation to achieve a goal, with a real sense of ruin if one looses. What is the use of a divine quest if everyone achieves the same end with some simply taking more time than others. No, reincarnation is a process of opportunities, opportunities that if missed, have dire consequences. Reincarnation does not go on forever, in the Vedic tradition there are certainly “Days and Nights of Brahma” - cycles of creation and cessation. If you do not make it in the creative cycle you will not survive the cessation. In the Biblical tradition it is much the same. When the Bible talks of the period from creation to the end of the world, it is clearly limiting man’s opportunities to be redeemed. Man’s opportunity for Transfiguration is limited, he does not have an eternity to make up his mind. Again and again we find that reincarnation is for a certain time span only and ends with either Ascension or annihilation. There is no room for universal reconcilia- tion in the esoteric tradition. Karma Reconsidered Karma Reconsidered What about Karma ? To understand the way in which reincarnation works we have to examine the effects of our actions. In generally held Christian doctrine there is a belief that actions do not really have an effect, we ask for forgiveness and the effects of the act are removed. This is obviously not correct, every action has an effect. Even if the"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 53 moral (and the If is big !) punishment was removed from an act by asking for forgiveness, the natural result of that act remains ! (For example, say I get Hepatitis from a heroin injection, while I may be forgiven for actions associated with my addiction, I still have to deal with the disease !) This process of cause and effect is found in many different traditions, in some forms of eastern philosophy it is known as Sanskaras or Karma. It should also be clear that when we talk of Karma and Sanskaras, we are not talking of some ridiculous “tit for tat” karma scheme, where someone steals from you because you stole from them. Karma works on a far more subtle level that this, Karma is the process whereby your own achievements (or lack of them) come home to roost. The psychic and spiritual environments you create are carried with you from life to life and create the conditions of life you experience. The thoughts and memories you create condition the astral matrix that influences your birth into a particular race, body and family. This is far more complex than simple “tit for tat” Karma, motive is far more relevant than moral platitudes. It is imperative that we remove Karma from the school of simpleton morality and back to where it belongs. What Actually Reincarnates ? What Actually Reincarnates ? Now we have removed some of the more popular misconceptions regarding reincarna- tion, we need to consider the major issue. Many schools of reincarnation seem to suggest that we are little Gods skipping from one life to another collecting experiences, much like some semi-divine travelling salesperson. However, this is again simply another ludicrous misconception perpetuated by those who know little. Since the Gnostic maintains that the Self cannot fully manifest in the degenerate form which is the physical body, then it is logical to suggest than in most of humanity the self is in a type of hibernation. If this is so, then it seems unlikely that it can it pass from life to life. Since Self only exists in potential (prior to entering the spiritual path), then the prevalent view of reincarnation seems to be in error. However the question obviously arises, if the Self does not reincarnate what does ? To understand this we need to discuss the Wave and Particle consideration. If we were to draw a line through time, a line that represented the experience of many"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 54 lifetimes. This line could represent the nature of you and your reality. If we stop the line, a particle or point is created, and this could also represent you. The question is which is correct ? This may seem strange but it is also a quandary at the centre of modern physics. When an atom moves, it leaves a trail. This trail proves the atom’s existence. However, does the atom exist as a singular, discrete point or particle or just as a trail. Can you take the atom (or Self) outside time and space and postulate a discrete existence. This question is central to our discussion of reincarnation, and really offers two answers to our question what reincarnates ? The first answer is the Particle theory. It states that there is an immortal self that reincarnates life after life gaining experience and developing through the accumulation of wisdom. This is the theory most students of Occultism are familiar with. The second theory is that there is a sort of “astral mould” that is conglomerate of Karmic factors developed through various incarna- tions. This mould creates the structures of each life and assembles the mental and spiritual environment that gives a semblance of a self. This understanding of reincar- nation is known as the Wave Theory. The Wave and Particle Debate The Wave and Particle Debate Throughout the history of occultism there has been a debate between these two viewpoints. Each of which is based on an understanding of the Self far removed from the other. The Particle explanation of the Self seems much favoured by Occultists and those of a traditional religious persuasion, it seems simpler on the surface, but when critically examined is not all that it seems. The Wave Theory originated in the various schools of Vedanta and esoteric Buddhism. It was made popular through the philosophy of Fredrich Nietzsche and is of great importance to the dualist worldview inherent within the Gnostic tradition. It is especially relevant for the Gnostic, because of the unique way it helps us to understand the Self and the conclusions it forces us to make about the nature of life. Interestingly enough, these problems are also encountered in the realm of science. In both biology and physics the question is raised regarding what the building blocks of"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 55 life really are. The answer is a debate between waves and particles. If we examine life, it appears as waves and flows from experience to experience without stopping; it changes form according to environmental factors and hence gives the impression that there is “no point of reference” only movement. Of course, if we froze this wave outside time and space the result would be a particle or point. The question remains, however, can we go beyond the experiment, can we stop time and space since we are locked within them ? Here we have the debate. Is this frozen particle beyond space and time real, or is the wave the building block of physical and spiritual life. (Fig 13) The Mould Theory The Mould Theory The Gnostic holds that the particle is only a product of the wave of cause and effect that flows through time. The Self (prior to Transfiguration) has been isolated due to the Alpha Event and accordingly, the self that exists in everyday life is a semblance only. This false or everyday self is a synthesis of environmental factors and memories. These memories and factors work together within the lower spiritual planes to form a sense of will or identity. This identity however, is not eternal, not of the light worlds, but is a contingency that exists only in the lower kingdom. It is nothing more than a personality or persona, it is not a true Self. This persona is formulated and influenced by the psychic memory system that collects and balances the “causes and effects” The Particle or Point Fig 13 The Wave or Line"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 56 (Karma or Sanskaras) of lifetimes. At death the persona starts to dissolve and then is reformulated when the psychic memory system enters a new body. In some sense the experience of self or identity in everyday life is illusionary, the self we experience is simply a mask that has been generated by our “Karmic” balance-sheet. The true Self is way beyond this level of experience. This constant process of reincarnation, reformation of the persona and re-creation of experience leads us into a consideration of the nature of eternal re-occurrence. Eternal Re-Occurrence Eternal Re-Occurrence If we accept the mould understanding of the everyday self, then we must consider one of the major ramifications of this theory, that of eternal re-occurrence. If the “mould” or psychic memory system constantly recreates life again and again from similar Karmic factors, then we have a process of eternal re-occurrence or repetition. This doctrine is not as bizarre as it may first seem, especially when we consider that even though the technology of humanity may seem to evolve, man’s problems seem to stay much the same. Every race seems to suffer the same hardships and difficulties, and even in our own lives the same issues seem to raise their ugly heads time and time again. In the terms of the East it is the cyclic wheel of reincarnation. However, there is no eternal travelling salesman, simply incarnational masks or personas created as products of the wave of eternal re-occurrence. This image seems to many a terrifying vision, a meaningless repetition of pain and suffering, death and destruction. While we may wish to distance ourselves from such a perception, when we look life straight in the face these experiences appear to be inherent within human existence. Life exists in days and nights, repetitive cycles of greater and greater intensity, a constant re-occurrence of experience until either one awakens - or the cycle ends. (Eternity in this sense is the existence of time and space, the timeline we spoke of earlier, it is not forever, simply for as long as time and space exists.). If our lives are eternally repeating then how can we break the cycle ? How can we escape the inevitable cessation of existence at the end of the age ?"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 57 Here is the key to solving the riddle of the wave and the particle dilemma. The Alpha event (or in more Gnostic terms, the fall of man) has caused the wave of creation to be brought into action. We are carried along with it and naturally head towards destruction. Only by breaking away from this wave can a real Self be created. Only by forcing a particle or point outside of the wave, beyond space and time, can a true identity be forged. The process by which this revolution is made is that of Transfigu- ration. The mechanism is the Will to Power. The Will to Power The Will to Power This is the key to the reality of reincarnation. The self only exists as a projection of the Karmic factors that are around it, and these factors repeat age after age, re-animating consciousness and recreating life as we understand it. At the Omega Day all consciousness is dissolved, for there will no longer be lower forms to contain it, only those who have been transfigured, those who have developed the Higher Will will survive. Only those who have broken free from the cycles of eternal re-occurrence will ascend. This secret teaching formed one of the inner doctrines of the early esoteric schools. The original Brahmins and Buddhists taught it, but only to initiates of the highest grades. Kendrick in his text on the Druids, states that the Druids also believed in conditional immortality, and taught that only the “warrior aristocracy” could survive death. Others simply returned to the earth, a form of immortality to be sure, but only as a dead body disintegrates into the soil, as nutrients return to the earth, not as a discrete and aware being. In Thus Spake Zarathustra Fredrich Nietzsche discuses the struggle to go beyond using evolution as a symbol of this battle. In one memorable passage he states .. All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man ? Humanity is a species in transition created by the individualisation of the mould or psychic memory. The only hope for humanity exists within the individual overcoming the wave of eternal re-occurrence, and forging a higher Will - a Will to Power. Here we are not talking of a petty will, a brutal desire to violence or warfare, we are talking"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 58 of a momentous inner strength that overcomes the restraints of the body and the flesh, and forges from the structures of the psyche a link to the Light world. The True Self only exists in potential, it is a light spark locked within the prison of the mould. Thus the central message of the Gnosis is to develop an overpowering drive, a will so strong that it breaks beyond the moral and ethical limits of the lower kingdom, and awakens the true Self and fashions a new man. The great mystery of the Gnosis is that we must create our own Inner Selves ! The need to go beyond the lower forms of morality, to disdain reproduction and to refuse family may seem to some the most frightening aspect of the Transfigurative process. However, as we go beyond all the limits of the lower kingdoms, a higher ethic is experienced. This higher ethic is that of the Pleroma, it is a flash of lightning from the throne of the Virgin Spirit. It is a vision of the true orbit of the Star Self that has been awakened. Transfiguration Transfiguration For the Gnostic the reality of this world is brutal, it is eternal re-occurrence and death. Man is caught in a cage, this cage is called the “Endura”. The Endura is self perpetuating and the more man surrounds himself with the illusions of his false self, (his false persona) the stronger the illusion becomes and the farther he gets from his true origin. Beyond the Endura is the Treasury of Light, the Pleroma which is the fullness of Will. The Pleroma represents the highest spiritual planes that are beyond the reach of consciousness contaminated by the Alpha Event. Within every being, hidden within its the very fibre, is the knowledge of how to overcome the Endura and return home. Beyond all Karmic records and factors exists a memory, a glimpse of the First Estate, of the original nature of man. The process of Transfiguration is to break beyond the Endura (the world of the Archons) and retrieve the Gnosis coded within us, bursting forth with the power of divine Will and formulating an identity of Light substance. In the tradition of the Barbelo Gnostics, Sophia herself, feeling guilty after giving birth to the false creator, hid within his very own creation the keys to man’s liberation and the Demiurge’s downfall."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 59 Some Conclusions Some Conclusions When we examine the cycle of eternal re-occurrence and the nature of Transfigura- tion, we can see how wrong traditional views of reincarnation are. Reincarnation is not some carefully graded developmental process, but an opportunity to escape the lower worlds, to return to the dimension where real evolution takes place. Luckily for us, there is a knowledge, a wisdom, a Gnosis . A knowledge that can awaken us to the falseness of our everyday masks and personas, and assist in the process of breaking free to become what we really are. This transformation is never easy. To go beyond everything that exists in the lower worlds takes a special awareness, a special Will and that is what being a Gnostic is all about. Real integration is a complete existential disappearance from this entire nature field, by confluence with another life-spirit, and by the genesis of another existence adapted to this other life-spirit. This is the purpose of the Gnosis ! Unmasking, J.Van Rijckenborgh, 1958 . X"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 60 The mind is central to the spiritual system that we know as Gnosis. Indeed, the word Gnosis, in some sense, means knowledge and hence emphasises the importance of the intellectual path within the esoteric tradition. When we contemplate our earlier model of the nature of man, we can see what a central role the psyche has. If the brain-mind complex is the matrix that radiates energy into the various physical and etheric bodily systems, then its importance cannot be underplayed. At the same time, we must be cautious. In the twentieth century there has been a tendency to “psychologise” everything, whether it be Alchemy, Gnosticism, Magic, Demons, Gods or Spirits, there has been an attempt to interpret everything as products of the mind. While certainly the mind does play a paramount part in the Gnostic tradition, it is ridiculous to assume everything exists in the mind alone. Just as there are forces within the psyche, there are forces outside of it and psychology must be seen in this context. To create a psycho-centric system is as ludicrous as when the Church taught that the earth was the centre of the Solar System. The House with Many Rooms The House with Many Rooms Carl Jung describes in his works a dream which haunted him. It was a dream about a house, his house. Yet when he looked around this house he found it had a extra level he could not recognise. It contained rooms he did not know which lead to other rooms he did not know. Concealed levels lead to new wings, new storeys and further rooms. Until, at last, he came across a beautiful old library full of what seemed to be precious books. On examination he could not understand the symbols written on their spines, nor interpret what the language they were written in. Jung’s dream is a superb analogy of the nature of the human psyche. While we tend to think of the psyche as simply having conscious and unconscious (sometimes called sub-conscious) levels, there is actual far more than is first perceived. Since society exists on a hierarchical level (and develops in a similar fashion, see our later study on Jacob’s Ladder), then as we delve deeper into the mind we find hierarchies of memory. (fig 14 ) While on the surface there exist individual memories. As we go deeper timelines merge and a Collective"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 61 Unconscious results. In some sense the first floors of the house might be our own, but the courtyard and library belong to all. As we exam- ine the hierarchy we find strata on strata of uncon- scious material - familial, national, racial, cultural, hu- man and perhaps even be- yond. Each strata includes material relevant to that spe- cific focus. Within these memory conglomerates are images which have been in- vested with certain value and certain symbolic power. These are known as Archetypes. Archetypes Archetypes According to Jung the contents of the personal unconscious is feeling toned complexes, memories based on the per- sonal and private side of psy- chic life. While the contents of the Collective Unconscious is based on signs and symbols, in the main it is composed of Archetypes. Archetypes are “representation collectives”, they are conglomerates of cul- ture and belief which exist in the unconscious and operate as a language of development. There is a whole world within the collective unconscious, a world which like our own, is a mixture of light and darkness, wisdom and error, suffering and ecstasy. The archetypes are a language which symbol- ise the whole psychological and spiritual state of humanity, they also hold wisdom which is from the highest worlds. Some examples of major archetypes include the Mother, Rebirth, Spirit and the Trickster. The importance of archetypes is that they are part of Rational Mind Personal Unconscious Collective Unconscious Deeper and deeper levels of Deeper and deeper levels of Collective Unconscious Collective Unconscious Fig 14"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 62 a symbolic language which can be used in spiritual practises to explore and rectify the unconscious. They also provide the reasoning behind our use of correspondences. An obvious question that arises is what is the value of all these correlations ? What does it matter that certain planes connect to certain bodily states and to certain postures or sounds ? The relevance is that if all these things are somehow connected, if they some how vibrate at a certain tone. Then perhaps through the use of related symbols and archetypes each can be transformed, even transmutated. If Archetypes are the collective symbol language of the whole of humanity then through their intelligent use the unconscious can be rectified. Engrams Engrams Since the unconscious is a living world composed of many locales and environments, then we can suppose that there are negative as well as positive forces. Just as there as personal memories and Archetypes, there are more dangerous memories and collec- tive forces. These are known as Engrams, Eggregores and Memes. The term Engram originally comes from neurology though Dianetics has, in more recent years, given it much unwanted press. It literally means memory trace, but is used in a more specific manner. When an individual experiences great pain, suffering or distress, memories of the event are not recorded in a normal fashion, they become locked with the associated emotions and are stored as Engrams. These Engrams are aberrative in nature and irrational in content, they record all related facets of the experience (sound, colour, touch, smell and so on) and lock them together. As more and more Engrams are formed they link together to form chains and begin to cloud the conscious or rational mind. This is why Gurdjieff said that we all live in the past, in any one individual there are thousands of personal Engrams clouding and overpowering the rational mind. When we consider how the mind is the gateway through which other systems of the psychic and physical organism receive their sustenance, we can readily see how Engrams reek havoc in the average person’s life. Here we are not talking about neurotics or psychotics, we are talking about average everyday people. Every- one is aberrated, everyone lives in the past, everyone is conditioned by Engrams. Hence, a major task for the Gnostic is the processing of the unconscious, and the removal of Engrams and their refiling as normal memories."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 63 The problem is that Engrams do not just exist in the personal unconscious. Families can have Engrams, so can states, countries and races. Accordingly, the collective unconscious is a wild place to explore. Freud believed the unconscious was an evil world, a “Pandora’s Box” of destruction and terror, Jung saw it in far more rosy terms, the truth lies somewhere inbetween. Two of the major Engramic forms that exist within the collective unconscious are Eggregores and Memes. Eggregores Eggregores An Eggregore is a collective group mind, it is a form that has been created by the thoughts of a group of people with similar beliefs over a period of time. As time passes, the energy of that belief takes on a certain “life of its own” and becomes what is known as an “Eggregore”. Eggregores are, by rights, not necessarily Engramic. There are also positive Eggregores of organisations, groups and associa- tions. However, since man is by nature a fallen creature, Eggregores tend to end up out of control and become unwieldy, forming little vortexes of energy in the collective unconscious and by correspondence, on the astral worlds. Some of the more unusual Eggregores are those which are religious in nature. Many Gods are artificial and created out of fear and insecurity, such gods and deities are real in a psychological sense, but since they lack connection to the light world, they tend to work in destructive and neurotic ways. The degeneration of God-images in Judaism and Christianity can be clearly seen with the replacement of real spiritual forms with psychologically projected (neurotic) forms, or Eggregores. The difference between these is important and can be readily illustrated. Take for example, a historical figure. After his death we have the facts about the historical figure and perceptions of that figure. After a period of time we may even have conflicting perceptions of this figure, and hence, have X number of differing perceptions. This process may continue, and schools may develop around these perceptions, with people pouring emotions and feelings into \"their perception\" of this figure. The end result is a series of Eggregores in the lower astral regions and in the collective unconscious that have little or no connection with the original historical figure. These forms are then fed and utilised by the fallen energies that populate the lower plane to their own ends. From one historical figure we have ended up with.."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 64 1. The Historical figure. (The Thing in Itself). 2. Different perceptions of that figure. 3. Eggregores or artificial energy forces created of that figure. For example, we may have a Catholic Jesus, a Philosophers Jesus, a Protestant Jesus and even a New Age Jesus. (fig 15) It must be understood that there is an immense difference between the forms of the mind and those of the universe itself, between Archetypes and Gods and between Archetypes and Eggregores. In some cases there can even be two or more distinct forms of one deity. For example, we have the Jesus of history and the neurotic, twisted forms created by the various Churches and denominations of Christendom. All exist and are, in some sense, real. One is of immense Light power, and the others of great Archonic power. One leads from the Lower Worlds into the Static Kingdom, the others perpetuate the Dialectic Cycle. When such images become confused, personal mental components can be fixed onto external deities and thereby become highly destructive. When we start to consider the nature of the Eggregores we can easily see how the Archons can twist such images to their own benefit. Eggregores serve the fallen kingdoms well, they collect energy from human belief and channel it into degenerative forms. Do not get the idea Fig 15 Many different Jesus’ Many different Jesus’"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 65 that Eggregores are only passive, in conjunction with their comrades, the Memes, they spread like wildfire through towns and cities controlling thought and influencing emotions. Just as disease can spread from one to the another, so too can Eggregores. Since at some level all of humanity is linked, once false idea can destroy a kingdom. Memes Memes Memes are a recent discovery, but prove an excellent way to understand how Eggregores take control of human minds. Memes and Eggregores are similar, but not quite the same thing. In the more radical schools of modern biology the theory has been put forth that Genes use humanity for their own purpose. Now this may seem strange until you think it over and consider the implications. The genetic structure of mankind is made up of certain programs, these programs have no ethical or moral precedent or limits, they simply work until their program is completed. Since their program, at least according to Darwinian evolution, is to create more and more physically refined forms of life, then the genes will manipulate mankind more and more as the complexity of the program increases. Intelligence will only be of value insomuch as it functions to serve a physical end, and the primary focus will be on physical perfection. This is very much what we see happening throughout the chequered history of human relations, all of the clashes between men and women can be reduced to one simple equation - the genetic manipulation of conflict. Men fight for women and territory, women tend to search for the ultimate specimen (why do feminists still look for rough working class men and reject the new age wimps their philosophy engenders ?). This certainly is a simplifica- tion but the genetic basis of the conflict has been readily demonstrated in the works of such scientists as Robert Ardrey, Desmond Morris and other socio-biologists. The Lucifer Principle by Howard Bloom (Allen and Unwin, 1995) is an excellent summary of the field having been written from a nonprofessionals' perspective. Men and women are both manipulated by the genes desire to reproduce, it is the genes that control and manipulate, not the individual, our psyche simply creates complex Engrams to justify the decisions made by our cells. If we correlate the genetic program with the fallen nature of matter, we can start to see that the program of humanity is the very antithesis of spirit. As the gene program plays out, more and more of our spiritual essence is lost, exponentially. In some sense we could even go as far as to say that the very building blocks of matter are the building blocks of the Demiurge’s kingdom."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 66 Genes sit at the centre of each cellular blob, dictating the construction of a multi-billion celled body like yours or mine. As genes are to the organism, so Memes are to the superor- ganism, pulling together millions of individuals into a collec- tive creature of awesome size. Memes stretch their tendrils through the fabric of each human brain, driving us to coagu- late into the cooperative masses of family, tribe and nation. And memes - working together in theories, worldviews or cultures - can make a superorganism very hungry. The Lucifer Principle. Howard Bloom, Allen and Unwin 1995. Memes are the collective unconscious equivalent to genes. As man has become physically more complex, the Archons needed a strategy to control and manipulate thought. This strategy began in the lower reaches of the collective unconscious. As Eggregores began to take hold of an increasing amount of human thought, the Archons worked to create Eggregores of special power, special destructive value. These specialised mind-traps we can call Memes. They reproduce through human consciousness at lightning speed and move from mind to mind, they masquerade as theories, concepts and philosophical systems that bring people together into mindless conglomerates. These conglomerates, group minds or Eggregores are then easily manipulated. We only need to take a brief trip through history to see how this has occurred. As we move towards the end of the cycle, Memes are playing an accelerating role and are bringing together more and more of humanity into one mindless, physical, Demiurgic superorganism - the New World Order. The Limits of the Mind The Limits of the Mind When working with models of the mind, we need to appreciate the innate limits to our model. As discussed earlier in this course everything cannot be reduced to psychological equations. In various traditions of Magic, for example, psychology is a pre-requisite for occult training, indeed Israel Regardie of Golden Dawn fame suggesting eight or nine years of psychoanalysis before any practical occult"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 67 instruction should begin. While we may not go that far, it is imperative that the Gnostic understand the nature of the mind as well as that of the spirit. In some sense there are two very distinct forms of occult practice, psychological techniques and spiritual techniques. By their very nature these two systems work on very different levels. A prime example of this is the timeline we discussed earlier in the course. While the timelime is certainly central to forms of Gnostic psychology (Psychogenesis) at the same time it has its limits. For example, if the timeline only exists as a “time” line then events that occurred before the advent of time, space and matter cannot be found on it. Accordingly, even if we use the most developed past life retrieval techniques there is a limit beyond which the mind cannot go. In terms of the seven bodies of man there are two memory systems, the unconscious (at the Astral level) and the Mediator Self. This means that while certain problems can be resolved at the psychological level (the unconscious), some cannot. According the Gnostic must always be aware of the limits of the mind. A good way to conceptualise these limits is in what is known as the three A’s. The three A’s The three A’s The three A’s are Animal, Adept and Angel. Each represents an image of a certain level of human consciousness. The Animal is the body, the Adept the mind and the Angel, the developing higher self. Each can only exist correctly at the level to which he is assigned. The Animal and Adept make good servants but very bad masters. The Animal is the body which we have as an interface to the physical world, if it is allowed to go its own merry way then it will become our master. It is a difficult beast to control and is manipulated by desires, lusts and, of course, genes. The Adept is the mind, it too, is a servant not a master. There are lots of highly intelligent people who have no sense of the spiritual life whatsoever. The mind is a scribe, a record keeper, even a grand machine, it is not the True Self. The mind is a difficult thing to control, and yet it must be forced to submit. The mind will rebel, demand rights, give us strange thoughts, dreams and nightmares, yet ultimately it has no real power. It is a glorified computer, a good model, certainly, but a computer no less. (Fig 16) The Angel is the true Self, the spark of Light. It exists only in potential and must be brought into action through Transfiguration. When the Angel becomes the centre of"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 68 one's existence the Animal and Adept (and other related systems) fall into place. However, since we are in a fallen system, there will always be a battle until matter is finally rectified. Even if the Animal and Adpe are forced into obedience, since matter by its very nature is Demiurgic, the war will continue until the Omega Day. The idea of calling the higher self an Angel or even better, the Holy Guardian Angel (HGA) is to destroy intellectual models and concepts. The term HGA sounds so utterly ridiculous, so beyond the intellect, that it serves its purpose. It emphasises how alien our true self is to worldly definition. In the Gnostic Tradition there are three phases of coming into an experience of the True Self, they are the External Angel, Knowledge and Conversation of the HGA and Union with the HGA. Each stage has its own characteristics and dangers. (fig 17) The Holy Guardian Angel The Holy Guardian Angel The First Stage:The External Angel The First Stage:The External Angel The first stage in the spiritual life is to experience the HGA as a separate entity. As a novice in the Gnostic tradition we experience the battles with the Animal and Adept, and sense the HGA as a far away goal. In many traditions (such as Bhakti Yoga) the HGA is seen as a focus of devotion and veneration. It is even sometimes visualized as a deity or personal spirit. This stage of the spiritual path is where we Mind Body Emotion Life out of Balance Work etc Life centred on the True Self Fig 16"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 69 work to subjugate the mind and body and awaken the HGA. This stage is probably one of the most misunderstood aspects of the mystical tradition. Christians talk about giving their life to Jesus, making Christ the centre of their existence and yet do not have any idea of what this really means. The Christian concept of conversion is a corruption of the mystical transformation that happens when we enter the path of Transfiguration. The Christ who is the HGA and the Son of God, the Light that becomes the centre of our lives is our own True Self. Conversion is the process of putting the Animal and Adept in their places, destroying links with the Demiurgic Kingdom and invoking the true Self. This is the first stage. The Second Stage: The Second Stage: Knowledge and Conversation Knowledge and Conversation The Second stage is where the Gnostic begins to make contact with his HGA. This is a dangerous period. So many times Gnostics and would be Gnostics confuse Metamorphs (false personalities) with the true Self. Even worse, they confuse Fig 17 Phase One: External Angel Phase two: Knowledge and Conver- Phase Three: Union: The New Man Adept HGA HGA Adept Homo Novus"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 70 communication from their own inner self with communication with the Source of all, and become prophets of their own little faiths. It is important that this stage be handled with care, we must not confuse the personal HGA with the Father of Wisdom nor with false personalities. As the Adept confronts the HGA he is transformed, the mind is flooded with light and becomes a new mind. While the Animal cannot be so transformed, if it was we would surely die since matter cannot fully contain the force of spirit, the Adept, at least, will become a more suitable scribe. As the mind is transmutated and communicates with the HGA the stage is set for a further transformation. This second stage is known as the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The Third Stage: The Third Stage: Union, The New Man Union, The New Man Union with the HGA is the most dangerous of operations, unless the mind has been properly prepared the energy that it invokes will destroy it. Since the light core comes from the Static Kingdom it cannot fully exist in the lower world, and hence Union with the HGA can never be fully experienced in a mortal body. The Gnostics understood this, and this is why they went to such pains to explain the real nature of the physical form of Jesus. For the Gnostics, the body of Jesus was only partially physical. After his Baptism (initiation) his physical body was transformed and became a phantom or shadow. For most of us this sort of transformation is unlikely, and hence, as we communicate further with the HGA a close relationship is formed. However, union with the HGA is normally reserved for the evolutionary cycles after we return to the Treasury of Light. There are many dangers at this stage, I cannot list the number of Gnostics who have tried to artificially bring about union with the HGA and become convinced they are the Lord of Wisdom himself or at least some vast entity. Self delusion is the price they paid and one of the biggest risks on the spiritual path. There are many risks on the path of Transfiguration, be aware of them ! The process of awakening the Light Self is central to Gnostic practice, but also thwart with danger. We are living at the end of the age, in the fallen kingdoms - expect trouble.

However, as the Self awakens, the Gnostic will then truly know his home and begin to experience genuine spiritual growth and development. The Law of Correspondence The Law of Correspondence By now you should have a sound working knowledge of the foundation stones of Gnostic psychology. The next thing we should provide is a series of correlation charts. This way you can link what we have discussed about the mind with materials on the seven planes, worlds and later the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. At first all these correlations may seem a bit contrived, but they are for a reason. The Law of Correspondence is one of the major philosophical premises of the Gnostic system, it is based on the dictum of Hermes “as above, so below”. Even though the Alpha Event caused a rift between the worlds, the basic framework of the universe is still the same. While matter is certainly fallen, it has fallen on the same patterns or vibrations as all of the forces within the total system. Nothing is totally outside, accordingly, all things are somehow connected, even if only in design or prototype. If we can work out the vibration rates or correlations between varying systems (bodies, planes, worlds, Chakras, colours, sounds etc.) then we can use this knowledge to bring about influence and change. If we find that, for example, a certain plane, body, state of consciousness, colour, sound, taste and so on are related, then it isn’t a far step to using some sort of spiritual practice to influence or change one or all of the correlations. This is very much the foundation of the ritual technology used within the Gnostic system. Some basic correlations are fouund in figures 18 and 19. X"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 73 The aim of Transfiguration is the total transformation of the individual. It is not enough to refine or purify the earthly elements (the Dialectic), the earthly must be totally replaced with elements of Light. As discussed in our last study the chaotic mind must be rectified and trained to become the Scribe or Adept, as the mind changes other transforma- tions will begin in reaction. One of the most important is the development of the Light Body. While the physical organism itself can- not be transformed the essence which controls and moti- vates it (the electro- magnetic field), has a special role in the Transfiguration process. For the Gnostic to explore and learn within the spiritual worlds he must have a spiri- tual body or vehi- cle. Hence a major task within the pro- cess of Transfigura- tion is to formulate a body of light from the electro- magnetic field. This light body exists in potential within the etheric and astral fields, but only through the trained use of the imagination can it be manifest;this light body is known as the Antakarana. The Antakarana The Antakarana The Sanskrit word Antakarana has no equivalent in English, the closest definition we can come to is the process of building a psychic antenna. It literally comes from two words “Antar” meaning inner and “Karana” meaning action. The Antakarana is literally the body formed by spiritual action. It is the stage where the instincts and electro-magnetic forces are forged into a spiritual vehicle capable of entering the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 74 Treasury of Light. This light vehicle can then be used by the Gnostic to explore the higher worlds where lower vibrations, such as those of the untransfigured astral or etheric bodies, cannot enter. This is an important consideration for when the untransfigured man tries to explore the higher worlds he can only go as far as his untransformed astral body is capable of taking him. Accordingly, he ends in the lower astral kingdoms, where he will confuse the astral light of the Archons with the real light of the higher worlds. The process of forming the Antakarana is through the use of the imagination and is intricately connected to the Seven Chakras or as the Gnostics understood them, the Seven Churches. To appreciate this we need to understand that the brain/mind complex and the electro-magnetic fields are not isolated in their respective systems. It is too easy to consider the brain/mind as only operating within the physical organ of the brain, but consciousness is more complex than that. Consciousness exists on seven different levels and manifests in both the brain (in its seven components sometimes known as the seven brain-circuits or “brains”) and in the seven consciousness centres of the organism. It is the same with the Antakarana, it is formed through the transformation of the seven psychic centres of the astral-etheric field. These centres are of great importance as they form an interface between the undeveloped man and the Transfigured man. Through the use of imagination, meditation, ritual and related techniques the energies in these centres can be refined and the Antakarana and Adept/Scribe created. As further refinement takes place more energy from the Solar Logos can be received into the psychic/ mental structures, while at the same time limiting the receipt of fallen forces This is self perpetuating, as more light is received, the Chakras are further developed and more light is received again. The Seven Churches or Chakras hence form a central aspect of the spiritual practice of Transfiguration.

The seven churches of Revelation each can be related to the seven psychic centres or Chakras with the teachings given to each Church (warnings, blessings etc.) relating to the consciousness and activity at that level. To begin with, we should examine a basic tabulation of the structure and an explanation of the centres. These attributions illustrate how each Church can be understood as a centre of energy within the psychic organism. In his pioneering work, The Theories of the Chakras (Quest Books, 1981), Dr. Motoyama is able to show the energy of these centres links with the Nadis or force lines of traditional acupuncture. Throughout the mental, astral, etheric and physical organism there are networks for the transmis- sion of energy. Nerves, synapses, meridians and Marmas all transmit various degrees of Prana to and from various systems. Within each system there are major receiving and distribution points, these are the seven Chakras. These seven cen- tres are interface stations whereby energy from the So- lar sphere can be received and where, via spiritual prac- tise, the energies of the mind and astral-etheric organism can be transformed. The Seven Chakras are located within the astral and etheric bodies (with links to the vari- ous related levels of con- sciousness) and are seen as a sequence of energy receptors an distributors, the term Chakra literally means “Wheel of Energy”. The size of the Chakra tends to be from two to six inches varying according to the degree of spiritual development. Each of these centres is related to a state of consciousness and a colour. The states of consciousness can also be discovered by a esoteric reading of the seven days of creation in Genesis The Four Attributes of the Churches The Four Attributes of the Churches The four attributes of each Church help us to appreciate the unique nature of each of the energy centres. These centres are central to the process of transforming the electromagnetic field of the Gnostic from the Dialectic to the Static. The Kundalini or Serpent power based in the lowest centre is energised in such a way that the serpent seed (the Taint of the Archons) is replaced by the Serpent of Wisdom (the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 77 Messiah). It is interesting to find that this transition is reflected in the Old Testament tale of Moses holding up the cross interwined with the serpent to heal the people of Israel. The serpent mentioned is numerically equilvant to three hundred and fifty eight, which is also the number of the Messiah or Christos - the Self awakened Saviour, the True Self of every awakened being. The four attributes of each Church as given in the Book of Revelation are: 1. Characteristics of the Church and City. 2. Commendation of the Church. 3. Counsel and Warning. 4. Promises to Overcomers. The Church of Ephesus The Church of Ephesus The Church of Ephesus is the Base Chakra. It is known as “Desirable” and is that of the primal instincts. It is desired by and desires the Sahasrara (Laodicea) Centre. The union of these centres locks the organism into the Static currents of the Treasury of Light. The Characteristic of the City is that of change, the change from earthly to Gnostic Worship. This represents the transmutation of purely \"nature\" oriented vibrations into forces that serve the spiritual goal. This technology includes the correct use of passion and desire with the process of Transfiguration. The key here is that all drives and goals must be directed towards the Treasury of Light. The Commendation of the Church is given for its patience and labour and it is especially commended because it has not fainted. These images refer to the immense effort and perseverance required to keep control over the energies of the base centre. The ideal situation would be total awareness or in more Biblical terms “not fainting”. The Counsel and Warning is that the Church has left its true love. This clearly refers to the need for the base centre to be totally directed to the Treasury of Light. Whether it is swayed by family, lust, desire or even love, any movement away from"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 78 the goal is \"sin\". (The word sin literally means \"to miss the mark\".) The Promise offered to those who correctly use the base Chakra is the ability to \"eat from the Tree of Life\". This has many different shades of meaning, ranging from the promise of immortality to the liberation of the Self through the activation of the Tree of Life. The Church of Smyrna The Church of Smyrna The Church of Smyrna is the Svadhisthana Chakra in the Hindu system or in our terms the Sacral Centre. It is known as “Sweet Smelling” and is related to the sexual organs. The sweet smell refers to the Ojas or psychic force that dwells within the energy that flows through the organism of both the male and female. It also has a specific sexual meaning in terms of Tantric practise where it represents the psychic energy found within the sexual secretions themselves, the smell relating to the ripening of the energy at certain times of the year. This correlation of sexual secretions, time and energy represents one of the inner teachings of Gnosticism as well as Buddhist and Hindu Tantra. The Characteristics of the city include life, earthquakes, plagues, fires and mas- sacres. These refer to the intense dangers associated with the energies of this centre. It is the centre of sexual fire, and when the base centre is activated and force is manifested at this level it must be totally controlled so that the energies continue on upwards towards redemption. Loss of control can mean destruction or obsession, a relevant maxim here is that \"all acts of sex are acts of power\". Related to this characteristic is the Mystery of the Terrestrial and Celestial Paths, while both paths have much in common they activate the energy centres in different ways using very different technologies. The very things that are forbidden to those of the Terrestrial Path are used by those of the Celestial to achieve liberation. The Commendation given to the Church is for standing strong in the time of tribulation and persecution. This refers again to the great discipline need to control this energy centre. While the base centre refers to all manner of desires, this centre is clearly sexual in nature and demands initiated control. The Counsel and Warning is against hypocrites and blasphemers. These descriptions"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 79 refer to those who use esoteric techniques to propagate the World of the Archons, to satisfy an addiction to pleasure or power. It also refers to the innate error of reproduction and the propogation of children. It also can be applied to the supposed Christian Churches who have no knowledge of the inner teachings and offer pithy morality and prejudice in the place of wisdom. The Promise is the gift of the crown of Life. That is returning to the Treasury of Light, reaching the Crown at the pinnacle of the Tree of Life, the top of the head Chakra (Kether). The Church of Pergamos The Church of Pergamos The Church of Pergamos is the Solar Plexus Chakra. It is known as “elevation or height”, for it governs the balance of the organism through its central position. It is also elevated in that it dominates and controls the lower Chakras. The Characteristic of the city is that of being the capital city where the Supreme Court and priests of Babylon sat in Judgement. It can hence be understood that the Pergamos is the seat of control and discrimination (right thinking). However, there is clearly a great danger, for the priests of Babylon are fallen. Accordingly, it is imperative that our self-control comes from the True Self, not just from sub- personalities or the mind. The mind is a great servant, but a dangerous master. The Commendation of the Church is given because it holds fast to what it has been taught, has not denied the faith and has accepted the fact there are and will be many martyrs due to the stand they have taken. This relates to the achievement of balance through the Solar Plexus, which demands separation from the world and holding securely to the Static currents, even though there is persecution from the fallen kingdoms. The Counsel and Warning is the message that the Church holds many conflicting doctrines and must repent. (Repentance means to turn around, to go in the other direction.) This can be understood on two levels, firstly, one cannot serve two masters. Beliefs must be either Static or Dialectic, unless you are totally separated from the world and centred on the Treasury of Light you are under Dialectic dominion (whether you admit it or not). Secondly, within the psyche will be many"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 80 Dialectic programs that we carry with us into the spiritual life, they must be rooted out and destroyed. The Promise offered to those who correctly use this Chakra include the eating of the Hidden Manna and the Gift of the White Stone with a new name engraved on it. These promises are highly symbolic, the Hidden Manna represents a special stage known in the Alchemical process of self transformation. It is also sometimes known as the White Powder, it is a stage prior to the Philosophers Stone. This substance is symbolic of the processes of internal transformation that are working through Transfiguration. The Church of Thyatira The Church of Thyatira The Church of Thyatira is the heart or Anahata Chakra. It is known as \"sacrifice or contrition\" as it involves the sacrifice of the fallen facets of the organism and the things of the world to the Higher Self (Yechidah). The Characteristic of the city is that it is a manufacturing town with a altar dedicated to Apollo. These two characteristics are very important; the first represents the power of the heart centre, when properly activated it manufactures static forces that transform the organism. The second characteristic represents the importance of the Mystery teachings. Through modern scholarship it has been discovered that many of the Greek Mysteries completed and fulfilled the ancient Hebrew Mystery teachings, and accordingly Apollo represents the need to complete our understanding of the nature of all things. The Commendation of the church is fourfold...Charity, Service, Faith and Patience. Each of these attributes should be central to the Gnostic Life. The Counsel and Warning is against false teachers, fornication and meat offered to idols. These warnings can be understood in two distinct ways. Firstly, they are a warning against contact with the World of the Archons. False teachers, Fornication (not sex per se but reproduction) and meat offered to idols (Fallen Gods), all images reflecting facets of the fallen system. In a more esoteric understanding, these images can be related to fallen facets of ourselves. The false teachers are personas within the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 81 Psyche that would draw the Gnostic back into the World of the Archons. Fornication is the desire for union with things of the world and food offered to idols represents the false Gods or idols we may have within ourselves. How many Gnostics are still beguiled by internal demands for fame, money, achievement, material gain, and family. The Promise offered to those who use this centre correctly is the Gift of the Morning Star. The Morning Star is Venus or Lucifer and represents the state of \"light bearing.\" This is an allegorical way to represent the awakening of the Light or Static fields within the Gnostic. The Church of Sardis The Church of Sardis The church of Sardis is the throat or Visuddha Chakra. It is given the title of \"That which remains \"as it is the portal before entering the higher Chakras. It has a similar meaning in the Kabbalistic systems. The Characteristic of the City is Death. It is the centre of warning and echoes either power or destruction. A further characteristic of this city is that it is a city whose glory has passed away, this emphasises the role of this centre concerning the transformation of the Mind. The voice or Logos is also indicated by the throat and hence the old mind (Ruach) must pass away and the new mind must be formed through the power of the Logos. The Commendation to the Church is that there are a few who have not defiled the Mysteries. This is a clear message that only a small number can really use this centre correctly and transmute the psyche and achieve communion with the Logos. The Counsel and Warning is hold fast and watch. It is clear and precise, to achieve transfiguration takes steadfastness and awareness. The Promise is that those who correctly use this centre will be confessed before the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 82 Father. That is, they will join the Pleroma. It also has a Kabbalistic meaning, confession before the father means crossing the abyss and being reborn as a master in the Supernals (the top three centres of the Tree of Life). This is to be confessed or witnessed by the Father, Kether. The Church of Philadelphia The Church of Philadelphia The church of Philadelphia is the third eye or Ajna (Brow) Chakra. It is given the title of “Brotherly Love” because of its awesome power. The insight and force of this centre can only be understood when experienced through Agape of Divine Love, only by a pure desire to return to the Treasury of Light can this force be correctly awakened and experienced. The Characteristic of the city is its ability to grow and spread. This is symbolic of the great power of this centre, and its ability to transfigure the whole organism at its awakening. The Commendation of the Church is for its keeping of the Word. The word here is the Logos, the power manifested in the throat centre, but originating in the Ajna. Only by communion with the Logos can the Ajna be awakened. The Counsel and Warning is that there will be a temptation to make others worship at your feet. No semblance of fallen self can be allowed to remain when awakening this force, any dialectic field will cause destruction. The Promise offered to those who overcome this centre is that they be made a Pillar in the Temple of God. That is, they will have their whole Chakra system activated and transformed, and will thereby become Static in nature and achieve immortality. The Church of Laodicea The Church of Laodicea The church of Laodicea is the Sahasrara or Crown Centre. It is located above the top of the head and is known as “Judging the People”. Its name suggests the immense and awesome power of this centre, it is that of divinity, Godhood and deification. Through this enlightened state the whole universe and world is seen for what it really is - and judged accordingly."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 83 The characteristic of the city is a final warning, arrogance, compromise and destruction will be the \"reward\" of those who do not awaken to this state correctly. The characteristic of those who have grown correctly is Godhood. The Commendation has also been removed from the description. There is no second chance here, either perfection or destruction. The Counsel and Warning is similar, be zealous and not lukewarm. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Revelation 3:16 The Promise is that those who correctly open this Chakra and unite all the centres as one will achieve Liberation from the fallen worlds. The Creation of the Diamond Body The Creation of the Diamond Body If we again consider consciousness in terms of our Refraction Model, we may conceive that if it is refracted through the lens of the brain/mind complex, then a spectrum of seven states of being will result. In some sense this is what occurs within the human personality. This spectrum, however, since it is in the Dialectic world and the energy received is mixed, is of an unstable nature and the consciousness that results is fallen and has a tendency towards deterioration. Only by awakening the True Self can the mind reform the psychic structure of the organism, so the resulting states of Cosmic consciousness can be aligned with the Static Kingdom. This transformation involves both the creation of the Antakarana and the reformation of the Psyche. In the East this process is known as the creation of the Diamond Body and is best illustrated in the Tantric forms of Buddhism where there is a secret tradition known as Vajrayana or the Diamond Vehicle. In this esoteric practise, esoteric methods are used to return the astral-etheric body from its fallen to higher nature and to combine this redeemed light body with the trained Psyche. When this is done correctly, they merge together to form a Diamond body, an unbreakable jewel, a light that cannot be extinguished. This Diamond body is the vehicle in which the True Self manifests and is able to travel through the World of the Archons, battling against the seven planets and fallen webs and traps.

The practices of this Buddhist sect are esoteric in nature and have much in common with the secret techniques used within the Celestial Path of the Gnostic tradition. This tradition is also found reflected in the secret Chariot or Merkeva mysticism of the Kabbalistic tradition. Seven Days of Re-Creation Seven Days of Re-Creation Another tradition which expresses this process of re-creation is found hidden within the creation tale of Genesis. Emanuel Swedenborg, the Great Swedish mystic, taught that hidden with the seven days of creation was a description of our regeneration. Though he did not relate these to the Chakras, if we link them together we can gain a picture of the spiritual regeneration that takes place in the Gnostic life. The key however is to realise that since man is being re-created through the seven days of creation, the actions described are being examined from the perspective of the Transfiguration, not the fall of man.

From the perspective of the Chakra’s this day is the time when the great light of Gnosis purifies and transcends the base Chakra and transmutes its desires and drives into the something of a higher nature. The centre is Red as it is the colour of passion and of sacrifice, it symbolises the struggle and pain requirement to overcome the lower instincts.

The first state is when man begins to known that the good and true are something higher. Arcana Celestia, Emanuel Swedenborg (AC 20). The Second Day The Second Day This is when we divide the things of the Dialectic from those of the Static. (The firmament from that which is below the firmament.)

X"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 88 Origins Origins It is difficult when the question of the origins of the Kabbalah arises as there are so many issues involved. The term Kabbalah comes from the Hebrew word qabal and means both “to reveal” and “to receive”, it represents the secret oral teachings of the Israelites. Here then is the first hurdle in our discussion, who were the Israelites ? According to the Gnostic tradition the Kabbalah was the inner teachings of the Indo-Europeans or Aryans and the Aryans were the original Israelites. The term Aryan is not used in the racial sense but as a term of description for a large group of Indo-European peoples, it comes from the term Arya which means “noble, worthy or holy”. One of the major branches of this teaching was found amongst the peoples of Sumer and Egypt, and as Egypt deteriorated; amongst the people of Israel. The Israelite people were Aryans, the very term Adam means “he who blushes red”. They carried the Kabbalah with them into the deserts and it formed the secret core of their faith. As time progressed and Israel became a political force in its own right, the esoteric teachings were passed by secret brotherhoods such as the Qadesh. This lineage of the esoteric wisdom is sometimes known as the “Sethian tradition”, both the Essenes and Gnostics emphasised this unique designation. It was used in the sense of the genealogy of Genesis, where Seth was the replacement for murdered Abel and he represented the pure wisdom. Cain, on other hand, represented a fallen lineage, he was considered a tool of the Demiurge - an Archon in flesh. This conflict is important because it forms the very foundation of our understanding of the origins of the Kabbalah. In ancient Israel we have the Sethian form of Kabbalah, the Ariosophic Mysteries (Ario meaning Aryan and Sophic meaning wisdom), while at the same time, among the outskirts of the kingdoms of Israel were those who followed the Cainite traditions, the distorted teachings which belonged to the lower world. After Israel was taken into captivity, first by the Assyrians, and then by the Babylonians they became scattered. It was during this Diaspora the myth of the lost ten tribes began. According to the recent research, as the ten tribes travelled, they changed their names and identities and slowly took on new traditions, many completed their migration in Ireland, England and other European countries. Hence"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 89 the Ariosophic Mysteries travelled all over the globe to the lands we now see as Indo-European. There were earlier migrations too. The Israelites travelled to southern Spain and the Phoenicians settled in the Punjab region of India, but only the later migrations concern us here. The Ariosophic Kabbalah is embodied in much of the later Hermetic and Alchemical traditions and it represents the heritage of Aryan Israel. However, all is not at it seems, during this same period, a false tradition, a counterfeit Kabbalah was being developed. In Babylon the children of Cain created an amalgam of Babylonian Paganism and Israelite belief which later became known as the Talmud. As time progressed they stepped into the shoes of the now-believed lost Ten tribes and falsely identified themselves as Jews (of Judea) or as Israel. They edited the Torah to reflect their distorted view of Judaism, and created a apostate faith based on the values of the Talmud. As the deception continued many of these Babylonian Cainites migrated to other regions, they became known as the Edomites and later on many of their number integrated with the people known as the Khazars. The Khazars were of Turkish stock and converted to the Talmudic form of Judaism around 900 C.E. this conversion is of great significance. In his book, The Thirteenth Tribe, Arthur Koestler argues that modern Jewry is descended not from the people of Israel, but from the Khazars. Accordingly, it is said, they have more in common with the Turkish people than with the original people of Israel. (By the way, Koestler is not some rabid anti-Semite, he is Jewish !). The relevance of this is not to illustrate some wild historical polemic, but to show the difference between Sethian and Cainite Kabbalah. This is not simply a racial or cultural debate, but a discussion on the origins of Judaism, Christianity and Kabbalah. Just as the Gnostics rejected Christianity as a distortion of the true faith, they totally rejected Talmudic Judaism as a Demiurgic creation. Further to this, we know that the Essenes were a small group of the lost ten tribes who returned to Israel after the captivity and that they saw the Pharisees and Saduccees as being of a dissimilar culture, race and spiritual heritage. The Essenes and Gnostics agreed with Jesus in his evaluation of those who professed to be the Jews of that period Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 90 in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of John 8:44,45. As time has progressed the Talmudic form of Judaism has become accepted. We have come to call the people who were Khazars - Jews and even have come to accept their appropriation of the name Israel. The truth of the matter is that the Kabbalah is Aryan in origin, it is an Ariosophic tradition and is part of the Indo-European worldview. It is not and never has been “Jewish” in the modern misuse of the term. Restoring the Kabbalah Restoring the Kabbalah It is not easy to restore the Ariosophic Kabbalah. The Gnostics were attacked from both sides by the Jews and the Christians, their works were burnt and their lives taken. Luckily for us many Jewish and Christian groups purloined Kabbalistic traditions in an attempt to make them their own. While these traditions have been twisted and distorted, at least they survive. These teachings are of great value, they can be seen hidden behind the parables of Jesus and in the works of Valentinus, among many others. In the middle ages Hermeticism and Alchemy kept them alive, while during the Nineteenth century Eliphas Levi and others triggered an Occult Revival, and put into print many of the Hermetic Kabbalistic texts and it is from here that so much of our heritage derives. The task is still ongoing, there is much restoration to be made. The Foundations of the Kabbalah The Foundations of the Kabbalah The foundation of the Kabbalah is in numbers and shapes. It represents a mathemat- ical and geometrical way to understand the formation of the universe. Since the universe has been formed by emanation, stepping down from one level to another, then some framework is needed to comprehend the process. We can deduce this mathematical mysticism in the works of Pythagoras and many of the Greek School as well as in the earliest Christian and Gnostic traditions. In Jesus Christ, Sun of"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 91 God (David Fideler, Quest Books 1993) for example, we have an outline of the secret numerical codes found in the New Testament. In the works of Valentinus, the master Gnostic, we have an outline of the formation of the universe as a mathemati- cal sequence. Valentinus outlined a meticulous system which charted the movement from “divine depth”, to the dyad of depth and silence, to the four principles, to the Ogdoad and then onto the Decad and Dodecad. As time progressed the Kabbalistic form of mysticism became codified and the resulting structure came to be called the “Tree of Life”. The tree of life being a geometrical progression from the point, to the line, to a triangle (two dimensions) and to a pyramid (three dimensions). It is the development of life in a geometrical form. (fig 23). The story of its form begins with no-thing. This is the state beyond all comprehen- sion, it can have no attributes or form. It is absence, since to be some-thing is to be defined. In some sense it is even beyond no-thing, for no-thing is a negation of a thing. In the Secret Gospel of John it is called the Invisible Spirit. It is not fitting to think of it as divine or something of the sort, for it is superior to deity, nothing presides over it, for nothing has mastery over it, it does not exist in any state of inferiority, it exists in it alone because it lacks nothing. For it is utter fullness. Secret Gospel of John 1:33-2:4. At some time, before time, (since time and space were not) the Invisible Spirit who the Kabbalists know as Ain began to transform. It began to think, to expand and contract - to move. It is impossible to really describe what occurred, and hence language performs only a symbolic task. This expansion is known as eternity, limitlessness, boundlessness and endlessness and is called Ain Soph. As the Invisible Spirit begins to transform further, it becomes blazing endless light. In this creative phase it is known as Ain Soph Aur or Limitless Light. Together these three phases of the Invisible spirit are known as the Unmanifest or negative existence. From the Unmanifest the Tree of life manifests. The Tree of life is composed of ten centres known as Sephira (Sephiroth in plural), they are connected by twenty-two"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 92 paths. The first manifestation is Kether, the point, the Creator. Kether is the font of creation, the focus of light and power. From Kether manifests the two differentiations of Binah and Chokmah. These form the line, a natural progression from the point. Chokmah is wisdom, illuminating intelligence, it is related to the active principle and is therefore sometimes known as Abba, the Great Father. Binah is understanding or reflective intelligence. As a centre it is passive and seen as feminine, and is therefore known as Aima, the Great Mother. These two centres can be related to force and form and substance and consciousness. These three centres form the Supernals, they are seen as somehow separate from the rest of the tree and are divided from the lower seven centres by the abyss or barrier. While they are perfect and Static in nature (at least in the world of Atziluth), the lower seven centres are mixed and offer amalgams of light and darkness. Fig 23 Fig 24"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 93 The fourth centre is Chesed or Gedulah. It is known as Mercy and is considered male and positive in action. In traditional texts it is known as receptive intelligence. Some descriptions of it include love, majesty and magnificence. The fifth centre is Geburah. It is known as Severity or radical intelligence. While it is seen as feminine, it has characteristics not of passiveness but of strength and force. It is martial in tone. The sixth centre is Tiphareth. It is known as beauty or mediating intelligence. It has characteristics of harmony and equilibrium. It forms the point of the triangle of Chesed, Geburah and itself. Between Tiphareth and Netzach and Hod is another abyss known as the “Lesser Veil” or Paroketh. This forms the dividing line between the mind (and the astral worlds) and the higher dimensions of consciousness. The lower pyramid is formed of Netzach, Hod, Yesod and Malkuth. Their charac- teristics are: Netzach. Victory, Occult Intelligence. Emotion or Generation. Hod. Glory, Perfect Intelligence. Mind or Psyche. Yesod. Foundation, Clear Intelligence. Astral. Malkuth. Kingdom, resplendent intelligence. The Gnostic Tradition and the Tree of Life The Gnostic Tradition and the Tree of Life As we will show later in more detail, the Gnostics saw the development of the universe as an emanatory process. As the process of emanation expands, elements of degeneration manifest themselves. These elements of degeneration can be seen in many different ways, what we are really describing is the Alpha Event. After the error occurred, the emanation process continued, albeit, on a lower octave. There is the Treasury of Light (the Supernals) and the World of the Archons. In the lower kingdom emanation continues, and there are hierarchies of light and darkness - there are Aeons and Archons. The Tree of Life documents a model of the emanation process, below the dividing line of the “abyss” there is a mixture of light and darkness, emanations which are fallen but which also hold particles of light. The medieval writers of the grimoires illustrated this mixture by attributing an intelli- gence and spirit to each planet; a positive and negative force. The barriers that exist within the Tree of Life are of vital importance. While in our"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 94 discussions of the Alpha Event we examined the great Chasm, there are actually two breeches in the emanation scheme. There is the great chasm or Abyss between the Supernals and the lower seven centres, and the lesser veil or Paroketh which divides the lower tree from the higher spiritual dimensions. The Supernals form the Treasury of Light in the world of Atziluth, while below everything is a mixture of Static and Dialectic, Aeons and Archons. In Briah and the upper reaches of Yetzirah the forces are fixed, in the lower reaches of Yetzirah (the astral) there is the strongest Dialectic presence. The Chasm or Abyss is of great significance to the Gnostics. It is the division between the light world and the Archons, it is described variously as a Wall, palisade, turnstile and portal. It is seen as the great divide or barrier (Horos), and is said to be bounded with an embankment of dazzling white fire flaming walls. Between the higher and lower worlds is a narrow bridge, a rope, a ladder or a gateway through which only the Transfigured can pass. The best known symbol of this abyss is the cross (Stauros), it is pre-Christian in origin and includes pre and post Christian symbolism. It emphasises that only through death to the world of the Archons and rebirth and resurrection to light, can we enter the Treasury. In the Hermetic tradition, Saturn (Binah) is seen as the Guardian of the Abyss. After the soul has left earth it must venture through the seven planets, however only with correct passwords and codes can it pass each obstacle. When it confronts Saturn the soul is truly tested, only if it is of the Light Kingdom will it be allowed to pass. If it fails, the soul plummets back through the planets and returns again to earth. Since in many traditions Saturn is also the Demiurge, we can see a dual nature. Saturn as guardian (in the Static Kingdom) and the dark half of Saturn, existing below the abyss as the Demiurge. The abyss is both a doorway and a seal, it tests and also destroys. The Twenty Two Paths The Twenty Two Paths Each of the ten Sephira is connected to the others by a sequence of paths. While there are many different forms these paths take, the most accepted system is that shown in fig 24. Each of these paths is attributed to a Hebrew letter according to the Kabbalistic tradition first outlined in the Sepher Yetzirah. To each of these paths a mass of correspondences may be added; colours, sounds, Godforms, animals, images and so on. According to one tradition the Tarot cards can be attributed to these paths as well. The minor cards (1-10) are attributed to the Sephira, the King, Queen, Prince and Page (Princess) cards are attributed to Chokmah, Binah,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 95 Tiphareth and Malkuth and the twenty-two trumps are given over to the paths. There is much debate about the exact attribution, we cover this subject in detail in our courses on the Kabbalah and the Tarot. The Four Worlds The Four Worlds The tree of life has activity on four levels; known as the four worlds. These four worlds as seen as the four stages of the secret formula of the Israelites, the Tetragrammaton of YHVH. Each symbolises a facet of the emanation process, in modern terms, they could be seen as initiation, transmission, fixation and manifesta- tion or as archetypal, creative, formative and materials. They are also attributed to the four elements. Atziluth. Fire. Yod. Initiation. Briah. Water. He. Transmission. Yetzirah. Air. Vau. Fixation. Assiah. Earth. He (final). Manifestation. There a number of ways in which they can be related to the Tree of life. The way we favour is to relate each world to the trinities of Sephira, and Assiah to Malkuth. This can be extended so that there is a further tree of life in each world, thus formulating forty centres. In this second attribution the whole Tree of life in Atziluth is the Treasury of Light, while the lower trees in Briah, Yetzirah and Assiah are mixed. The Supernals in the lower mixed Trees are the more refined phases of the mixed worlds. Atziluth. Fire. Kether, Binah and Chokmah. Briah. Water. Chesed, Geburah and Tiphareth. Yetzirah. Air. Netzach, Hod and Yesod. Assiah. Earth. Malkuth. Atziluth: The World of Fire Atziluth: The World of Fire This is the world of the Treasury of Light, it is the Pleroma, the source of initiative energy forces. In this realm each Sephira reflects a facet or the divine energy of the Invisible Spirit.

It seems that in ancient times written text was used in a form similar to modern day codes and it was used by the priest-class to preserve and transmit arcane knowledge. It is even quite possible that this use predated the more general use of written forms and that the primary function of the written word was originally religious rather than communicative. Some occult historians have even suggested that some of the blame for the downfall of Egypt could be placed at the feet of the priests, who in confusing the hieratic and popular scripts (also causing the mixture of esoteric and exoteric forms) lost the Great Mysteries which were at the core of Egyptian society. It is difficult today to conceptualise language in a religious sense, we tend to see the written script in a purely utilitarian way. The closest we may get to it is consider the language of a computer. In computer languages the language is only useful in that it is able to create a certain result (i.e. a code produces a function in the given software). These languages have no value except that they communicate certain agreed functions which trigger certain results. The occult languages are the same, their value is in the agreed meaning to the symbols and the resulting increase in knowledge that occurs. In neither occult or computer languages is there a social element, the code represents certain actions or realities and causes certain effects. Since language today has a social and communicative function we tend to lose sight of its esoteric significance. As part of our study of Kabbalah we need to re-consider the role of the written word and examine its possible occult value."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 102 The Mystery of Hebrew The Mystery of Hebrew A secret of secrets for those who know wisdom: The moment these letters came forth, secretly circling as one, A spark flashed out to engrave.

It is also stated that these letters were of a special substance, the actual substance from which the universe itself was formed. This concept, that the alphabet has secret and occult power, is the basis for the Gnostic use of words and numbers.

The ancient Hebrews believed that there was such power inherent in the twenty two Hebrew letters that the very universe was formed through their use.

They are attributed to the seven planets of the Hebraic astrological system, they are seen illustrated in the sevenfold Candelabrum used in Kabbalistic liturgy. The Single letter are Gimel, He, Vau, Zain, Cheth, Teth, Yod, Lamed, Samekh, Ayin, Tzaddi and Qoph.

The"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 105 three mother letters are the Supernals and when added to the seven double letters - we have the ten Sephira. If we then add the twelve single letters, we have the twenty two Paths of the tree. If we accept that the letters are symbols or glyphs which represent certain vibrations or energies, then it would be reasonable to say that words are combina- tions of vibrations and therefore can have hidden meanings beyond their written form. For example, the word Achad in Hebrew means one or unity, this is its simple meaning. It is composed of the letters Aleph, Cheth and Daleth, if we add these together we get thirteen. If we accept that the vibration of the word is represented by its letters; then by investigating the number thirteen we can come to understand more about the word Achad. In Hebrew another word which is enumerated as thirteen is Ahavah (which means love). Here we have another interesting correlation - unity = love. If add them together we arrive at twenty six. Twenty six is the number of the Tetragrammaton or the four lettered formula which representatives the true and hidden nature of the universe. So we may conclude that the ultimate truth beyond duality is that unity and love are the same. This is just a slight indication of how the esoteric secrets of the Hebrew alphabet can be decoded . Gematria Gematria This process of exploring the relationship between words and numbers is known as the Kabbalah of number, there are many different applications of this art; we have chosen three for consideration here. Gematria is the form we have illustrated above, it uses the simple numerics of each letter and by combining them in various ways and comparing them to other words is able to reach a deeper understanding. It should be noted that this art can be applied to many languages, we are simply using Hebrew as an example since it was one of the primary languages used by the Gnostics. Two other forms we will consider here are Notariqon and Notariqon of the Tenach. Temura is a further form which uses agreed tables of numerical correspondence i.e. certain numbers or letters are attributed to other letters according to an agreed formula. Temura is not a popular form of the Kabbalah of number as without the table of attribution the work becomes undecipherable."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 106 Notariqon and Notariqon of the Tenach Notariqon and Notariqon of the Tenach The art of Notariqon is perfect in its simplicity, in some sense it could be considered a sort of Gnostic shorthand. It consists of making new words out of the letters of the original. One of the better examples of this art is found in the alchemical term Vitriol which was used as the codeword for Sulphur. However, when analysed, it has a deeper meaning. (fig 26) In Fig 26 we have a comprehen- sive description of the alchemical process coded into the term used for Sulphur, a superb illustration of how Notariqon can be used. The Notariqon of the Tenach is used more within the Gnostic and religious communities than within practical esoteric science. It can be seen primarily as an extension of the Notariqon technique where parts of a larger word are then used to create other words. For example, the term Tenach is the title given to the books of the Old Testament, it is composed of three letters Tau, Nun and Kaph (final). These are seen as abbrevia- tions for a further three words. Tau. Torah. The five books of Moses. Nun. N’vee-im. The Prophets. Kaph. K’soovim. Rest of the Old Testament.

The use of such formulae is especially relevant in relation to ritual and liturgical practise. It allows us to evoke a wide range of associations by the correspondences related to the letters in the given formulae. Some of the better known formulae used within the Western Mystery Tradition include INRI and YHVH. The INRI formula The INRI formula The letters INRI were those which were placed on the top of the cross on which Jesus was crucified. However, as time progressed and centuries passed, these four letters have gained a variety of esoteric interpretations and have transformed from an historical icon into an occult formula. By Notariqon the letters have been interpreted to include... Igne Nitrum Renovatur Integra. The whole of nature is renewed by fire. Igne Nitrum Raris Invenitum. Glittering is rarely found in fire. These two interpretations express divergent views regarding the Alchemical process of self transformation. One is the cosmic no, the other - the cosmic yes. One perceives the fire of passion as the way to renew the fallen world, the other warns of its danger. Both are correct and have something to say about the human condition. Another application given to these letters is to attribute them to the four elements. (fig 27) This elemental attribution leads to the more esoteric interpreta- tion of this formulae as found within the teachings of The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, in this interpretation the letters are related to Hebrew letters, astrological signs and the trumps of the Tarot. (Fig 28) Since this is a cyclic formulae, starting at I and ending at I, the final I is inferred and hence dropped from the formulae. We are accordingly left with INR. When this is found in the ancient Egyptian and Gnostic systems, it is in the secret word IAO. This formulae can be understood in terms of the old Egyptian myth of the death of Osiris and hence we have Isis, Apophis, Osiris. In the Gnostic Pantheon we can find a similar interpretation but with O being used to represent Oen or Aeon, the term used for a"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 108 I Yam Water N Nour Fire R Ruach Air I Yebeshah Earth F ig 27 I Yod Virgo The Hermit N Nun Scorpio Death R Resh Sun The Sun I Yod Virgo The Hermit.

After Osiris is murdered, Isis searches and finds all the parts of his dismembered body except his phallus (the fallen reproductive system).

(Fig 29) These interpretations of INRI and IAO centre on the death and resurrection of the Gnostic and the awakening of the light being within. Of course, this returns us to the start of the formulae, INRI as written on the top of the cross used to crucify Christ. The Formula of YHVH The Formula of YHVH YHVH is another formulae of great importance in the esoteric tradition. While many religious groups have translated this formula as Jehovah and interpreted it as the personal name of God. It is actually a formula, rather than a name or designation. (fig 30) The original ancient Israelites understood this and hence avoided pronouncing this divine name using substitute terms such as Lord and King. While the Old Testament accounts have corrupted the name and used it to designate a warrior like Archon, the original formulae is still valid and of value. This again illustrates how the origjnal Gnosis has unwittingly been passed down inside and behind a text which teaches the exact opposite.

In ritual activity, for example, we may create the associations as seen in fig 31. From this admittedly brief examination of the Kabbalah of number you should have some idea of its practical use. However, it is important not to think that these number systems are isolated to Hebrew. If we accept our “Gnostic Identity” hypothesis that the lost tribes of Israel traversed the globe before settling in Ireland, England and Europe, then we should also find the same Gematria at work in other Indo-European languages. After much research, this is certainly was has been discovered. Sanskrit for example, is believed to have been introduced when the Aryans invaded India and has similar forms of Gematria and code. Though it is certainly more difficult to use since it has fifty two rather than twenty two letters ! There are many other languages with developed Gematria functions, we have chosen the Druidic, Runic and Enochian to consider here, albeit briefly. The Celtic Legacy The Celtic Legacy In the lands of the ancient Celts the Mysteries were recorded in many different ways. For many years academics believed that the Celts only transmitted their wisdom orally, however, recent research now suggests that they used specialised alphabets for ritual purposes. The most commonly used form was known as Ogham, named after the Celtic sun god Ogha from whom it supposedly derived. Ogham’s use was primarily esoteric and is believed to have developed on the west"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 111 coast of Ireland, probably as a refinement of the finger languages of the Druids. Another esoteric Celtic system is known as the Tree Alphabet. One poetic and not too scholarly form of this code was published in “The White Goddess” by Robert Graves (Faber and Faber 1948). The Tree Alphabet or Beth Luis Nion is based on the Druidic mysteries, it is composed of twenty nine letters divided into four groups. Each group is related to various esoteric concepts, seasonal rites and groups of trees. The major seven letters were known as the Chieftain letters, they were attributed to the trees Oak, Hazel, Holly, Yew, Ash, Pine and Apple. Each was further attributed to a period of the year as were all of the twenty nine letters. However, the Chieftain letters governed the seven most important periods, for example, the Oak governed from the 10 th June to the 7 th July and was celebrated with the feast of Druir, which marked the Midsummer fires. The Runes The Runes Communication among the peoples remained a secondary function of the Runic writing throughout it’s long history, much more common was the use of Runes to invoke higher powers to effect and influence the minds and fortunes of men. Prof. R.M.V. Elliot The Runes are considered to have developed from the early picture-graphs used by the Aryan priest-class during the Bronze age. It is thought that even at this early stage the Runes were used to represent religious and esoteric concepts, rather than for communication. These earlier Runic images have been found in abundance throughout England, Ireland, Scandinavia, and to a lesser extent in other parts of Europe. While the earlier Runes were in pictograph form, after interaction with the various cultures of the Mediterranean the symbols began to take on the phonetic represen- tations of language. It is difficult to date this transition, but it is thought to have occurred around the second century BCE when the invasion of the Teutons of the Italian peninsula brought them into contact with both the Latin and Etruscan alphabets. After this period of transition, the Runes developed into a mature"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 112 alphabet of divination and magic. While certainly the early pictograph forms of the Runes had occult significance, it is primarily since the second century that they have become a fully working system. There are different systems of Runic interpretation, one of the more complete is Futhark. In Futhark there is a fully developed symbol system which correlates sound, letters, bodily postures, dates and timing as many other correspondences. Both the Druidic traditions and the Runic seem to have much in common with the Ariosophic Hebraic forms. While the outer form may vary, the essential Gnosis remains the same. The Legend of Odin The Legend of Odin In Norse mythology Odin is the God of Magic, his name originates from the Anglo-Saxon and means Pure Spirit. He may be equated with Thoth and Mercury, but has many discrete and unique characteristics. Odin is believed to be responsible for bringing Runecraft to humanity. As part of his initiatory quest he hung on the World Tree (Ygdrassill) for nine days and nights and finally, falling from the Tree, grasped the Runes to his bosom and brought them back to earth. The Kabbalistic imagery here is obvious, and shows how widely the Shamanic practises of the Ariosophic tradition had spread across the globe. The Shamanic quest of Odin is beautifully expressed in the poetic form of the Elder Edda. I trow that I hung on the windy tree, swing there nights all nine, gashed with a blade, bloodied for Odin, myself an offering to myself, knotted to that tree, no man knows whither the roots of it run,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 113 none gave me bread, none gave me drink, down to the depths I peered, to snatch up the Runes with a roaring scream and fell in a dizzied swoon. Well-being I won and wisdom too, I grew and joyed in my growth from a word to a word, I was led to a word from a deed to another deed. The legend of Odin symbolises the initiatory quest of Transfiguration. While using the Shamanic imagery of the Indo-Europeans, it embodies the transformation process albeit expressed in a different, while equally expressive and potent symbol system. As we experience the Tree of Life (Ygdrassill) gaining knowledge from each of its nine centres (except earth), we must grasp (comprehend) the secret alphabet (the paths), and integrate them whilst still existing in a fallen or earthly form. This knowledge or Gnosis can then be used to help us grow in wisdom, leading us from “word to word, deed to another deed” until we are new and reborn beings. The Mysteries of Enochian The Mysteries of Enochian The Enochian script is a most unusual form of esoteric language. It is named after Enoch, who it is rumoured, reached such a high state of illumination that he “walked with God and was not”. Enochian as a language or symbol-system did not develop or evolve naturally as most languages do, but was “received” through the crystal"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 114 gazing visions of John Dee (1527-1608) through the mediumship of Edward Kelly. ohn Dee, a respected Scientist and later Alchemist, began experimenting with the occult sciences but found himself most successful in using a crystal with the assistance of a sensitive medium. As they began to receive messages they found themselves in communication with a strange and powerful force which outlined a complete, yet cryptic arcane system, this complex revelation had its own syntax and internal consistency and was one of great potency. Since it was only of esoteric value, the correct pronunciations of the various letters and words triggered, and can still trigger, altered states of consciousness. From these communications Dee developed a system of Elemental Squares, Calls and Aires associated with terrifying visions and prophe- cies. These were refined and adapted by such later esoteric orders as The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Aurum Solis (Order of the Sacred Word). Probably one of the most vivid accounts of the visions and experiences that can be triggered by its use are found in The Vision and the Voice by Aleister Crowley.

The Practical Use of Occult Alphabets The Practical Use of Occult Alphabets Occult alphabets or alphabets used for occult purposes are not simply psychological filing systems. While certainly they can provide us with structures through which correspondences can be categorised and used, they are far more than just this. While it may be popular to reduce the effects of such systems to “unconscious journeys”, it is"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 115 not wise. These ancient languages offer a methodology through which it is possible to experience altered states and realities, to explore dimensions both within and beyond the human psyche. There are many different systems, many such as Enochian and the Alphabet of Desire (Austin Spare) are modern and artificial in creation. Others such as Hebrew and Greek have followed the normal organic growth paths of language, but still hold the codes hidden within them. Others still, like Futhark, are long since dead by the way of social communication, but still resonate with occult power. Each of these languages opens a door to a world of practical application. For example, research into the secrets of the Hebrew code has shown that it can be used as a sound system with relationships to physical, astral and etheric parts of the human organism and that it encompasses a complex system of Mudra (hand movement) and sound. While there is still a lot of research to do, we are at last starting to realise the potential of these languages and their relationship to the Kabbalah and Gnostic practise. The word rune comes from Runa and means “to Whisper”, in some sense this suggests the great respect shown for these languages by the original practitioners. To whisper and to speak from mouth to ear - each suggests the original oral nature of the alphabets and hence their close relationship to the Kabbalistic Mysteries. Israel Regardie in his introduction to Enochian studies gives us some good advice about the its power and dangers, this warning can certainly be extended to apply equally to the use of all occult alphabets. Enochian is a very powerful system and if carelessly used will bring about disaster and spiritual disintegration. The warnings given are not be to be regarded as platitudinous moralising but represent knowledge of the true facts. X"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 116 If we contemplate our Kabbalistic model in light of the Alpha Event, we come to realise that the final division between the worlds occurs just below the solar sphere. This barrier, known as the Paroketh, is a further stepping down in the emanation process. (fig 32) The upmost world (Supernals) is that of Pure light, the intermediate worlds (between the Abyss and Paroketh) is a mixed system but with a large percentage of light. While the lower worlds (below Paroketh) are a mixed system with a large percentage of darkness (Dialectic law), accel- erating until the Archons take predominance in the astral and physical worlds. Contact be- tween the Treasury of light and the other worlds is only possible through an in- termediary - the Solar Sphere. However, since the intermediate kingdom is also fallen, the Solar Sphere transmits both pure and fallen vibrations, in religious terms it trans- mits the energies of the Treasury of Light and the forces of the Archons. In the terms of esoteric science, it transmits X and Y factors. (Fig 32) To explain this point further, the Treasury of Light, which exists beyond and behind the sun, uses the Solar Logos as a gateway through which higher forces can re-awaken man. These forces are, in Gnostic terms, the Logos and Sophia. When they are manifested within the life of a Gnostic the True Self is awakened and the student becomes Christed. The Logos and Sophia are the twin poles of the X factor. At the same time however, the Sun also transmits the destructive currents of the Demiurge, these must be resisted and controlled if liberation is to be achieved. Fig 32: Veils on the Tree of Life"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 117 This destructive current is known as the Y factor, and also has twin poles, the X and Y factors create a Solar cross of four energy forces. (fig 33) The Solar Sphere is, hence, the focus of the mystery tradition, whether it be Apollo, Mithra, Christ, Horus or Ra, we can see the secret teachings in application. The Solar sphere itself became a symbol of the hidden mysteries. At rising it is the Logos, at the Height it is the Christ, at setting it is Sophia. This represents the doorway through which fallen mankind can awaken. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. John 10:9 The imagery of the Solar Sphere is central to our understanding of the technology of the Gnosis. These forces control mankind and influence our religion, philosophy and way of life. We can see in the many sun based cultures of the past, both destructive and constructive facets of solar imagery. For example, the use of human sacrifice to satisfy the demands of the Father Sun in Aztec culture obviously marked their loss of Gnosis and domination by the fallen Solar sphere. While the adoration of the three phases of the Sun within the Mithraic tradition helped explain the forces of the Logos, Christ and Sophia. (Fig 34).At the same time, however, we can see the destruction and degeneration of Mithraic worship in the Caesar cults of Rome.

The importance of the Sun/Son can be found in most esoteric traditions, whether it be Baal in the early El tradition of Canaan, the Messiah of the Israelite Mysteries, Ganesha in Hinduism or the Mithra of the Zoroastrians. It is the intermediary between the Treasury of Light and mankind.

While Mithra is seen as a Solar God, at times he is also seen as a Saturnian lord ruling over the Sun and Moon. This is because Saturn was related to Zurvan, the supreme God of Time (equivalent to the Lord of Wisdom), with the Logos being related to the Sun and Sophia to the Moon. Whilst Mithra was a Sun being, the Saturnian imagery indicated to the faithful that the Solar sphere was simply Zurvan's presence in the lower world - this is an important truth. This mystery is even more complicated when we realise that Saturn is the guardian of the abyss, and consists two aspects. The lower aspect of Saturn is seen as the Demiurge, while the higher is seen as the Guardian or Watcher. So we have Mithra as a mixed deity, representing both the light Sun ruled by the Guardian, reflecting Zurvan and a hint that the sun also contains the darker force which is symbolised by the Demiurge or negative Saturn. The Treasury of Light cannot exist in the lower worlds, due to the fallen nature of the Dialectic kingdoms. Accordingly, the Solar sphere becomes the intermediary, the manifestation and the gateway. In some sense this is where the legend of incarnation or the Avatar sprang from. The belief that God came into the lower worlds is an adaptation or analogy to the process whereby the Treasury of Light is manifested in the currents of Light, via the solar sphere. For the Gnostic, Jesus was Michael, a created being who incarnated and became Christed, he was not God made flesh. There are many other entities who being Old Souls achieve Christhood and become Son/Suns. In this sense these beings become manifestations of the Sun, and accordingly, we can appreciate how the incarnation motif became accepted, while not accepting its more anthropomorphic interpretation. S S OLAR OLAR M M YTHOLOGIES YTHOLOGIES The Solar tradition has many forms. The most common adaptation is that found in the language of myth and legend where the X and Y factors take on anthropomor- phic forms. For the Gnostic the Logos and Sophia are the twin poles of the X factor. One traditional adaptation, for example, was for the Logos to be related to the Sun and Sophia to the Moon, and this led to a wide range of sexual duality traditions using God and Goddess images. While these are fine in their place, it is"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 120 important to see them as mythological forms only, to worship the Sun or the Moon is to fall into the greatest error, and comes under the dominion of the Demiurge. Since reproduction is only a thing of the lower world and resulted from the error of matter, the images of fertility can only with extreme care be related to the Logos and Sophia. While certainly we can see reproduction as the process of uniting the Logos and Sophia within ourselves, which gives birth to a “child self”, in the Static kingdom, to allow this imagery to degenerate into nature worship or the idolisation of family is a great aberration. It must always be remembered that the Sun being the gateway to the lower world also transmits the forces of the Demiurge. The solar sphere can destroy as well as heal, corrupt as well as make whole. This tradition is embodied in many early myths and legends. For example, Horus and Set of Ancient Egypt, the twins of the Sun, where Horus is the power and glory of the solar sphere, and yet hidden within his breast is Set, the fallen and dark one. In nature this can also be readily discerned, the Sun can create deserts, as well as sustain the beauty of the forest - the sun burns just as quick as its causes growth. Fig 34 Setting Sun (Sophia) Sun At Midday: Mithra/Christ Rising Sun (Logos)"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 121 The Nature of the Solar Currents The Nature of the Solar Currents The energies which are emanated from the solar sphere have certain distinct characteristics. These characteristics help us to appreciate the nature of both X and Y forces. The major traits of these energies is that they are all pervasive, and interpenetrate all levels of the intermediate and lower worlds. (Briah and below). They are contractive and expansive, which means they may be magnified to fill a temple space, or concentrated to act through a talisman or icon. Both energies are manipulatable, that is, they can be modified and utilised through the trained will of the Gnostic. At the same time, this manipulation is only valuable if controlled by the True Self, as these energies will bring about subtle changes which are not discernible if only controlled by the psyche. Both energies are imitative and contactive, they form links with the objects they contact, and can modify or be modified to reflect the shape or form of any object. Both energies are absorbent, they can be programmed and imbued with certain characteristics. It should be noted that while X and Y factors can be programmed, they have inherent tendencies. X factors trend towards light, Y towards darkness. Both energies are cumulative, but have built in obsolescence. So while the energies can be collected into a certain form and accumulated, unless this is sustained, the energy will dissipate. Both X and Y factors tend to polarise, so within the X and Y factors there are X and Y poles. These characteristics of the X and Y factors are important, for they illustrate that both energies can be used in very similar ways. It is only the long term effects of the respective forces that makes the difference. A Gnostic using the X factors and a Sorcerer using the Y may seem little different in practise, however, the resulting transformation will be markedly variant. The process of using the X factor and"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 122 suppressing the Y results in experiencing Transfiguration and Ascension. Using the Y factors and suppressing the X will result in disintegration and ultimately Archonic domination. Solar Meditations Solar Meditations While discussing the X and Y factors emanated from the Solar Sphere may seem all too theoretical, there is a very practical application of such knowledge. If the Solar Sphere emanates X and Y factors then it may be suggested that by correspondence, these energies are within the light particles emanated from the physical sun. Accordingly, a system of Solar meditation may be developed. This form of practise is found in many of the great esoteric systems that have existed throughout time, the Essenes daily greeted the Sun at dawn, their Calendar, in opposition to the prevailing calendar of the Pharisees, was solar rather than lunar based. The ancient Hindus had an evolved system of Surya Yoga, the Mayans and Aztecs believed that the Sun was a great source of power that had to be honoured and supplicated, and in most of the old pagan traditions the Sun had an honoured place. Probably one of the most outstanding examples is found in Akhenaton, the Sun Pharoah of ancient Egypt. For the Gnostic the physical sun is a window through which the Solar Sphere shines, it emanates X and Y factors which influence and control the development of humanity. By using Solar meditations it is possible to increase our receipt of X factors, and hasten our spiritual development. As the energy is received from the Sun the physical rays of light enter the eyes and pass their energy into the physical system, while at the same time the X and Y factors are absorbed into the astral and etheric bodies and circulated through the Meridians, Chakras and Marmas. A Simple Solar Meditation A Simple Solar Meditation Solar meditations do not have to be complex. There are many beautiful prayers to the Sun in many traditions. The prayer to Aten written by Akhenaton is one prime example. In the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, supplications were offered to the Sun at four times daily; sunrise, midday, sunset and midnight. The important thing however, is to create a personal system of meditation, not to learn some technique by rote. Some schools like to use Solar meditations four times a day, some only at sunrise or sunset, it is really up to you to find what suits. There are two"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 123 simple techniques which can be used with some success. The basic solar meditation is probably most successful at sunrise. You stand facing towards the rising sun. You should be awake, relaxed and prepared a few minutes before the Sun rises. You begin to meditate on the concept of the “Treasury of Light” and the great fullness (Pleroma), and the power of the Light worlds. As the sun rises you start to feel its light radiations and feel the light hitting the back of your eyes. (which should be closed) As the Sun rises you may like to use a prayer, affirmation or supplication, it is up to you. A more advanced technique used within the Meso-American tradition is similar to the above except that you start to jog on the spot as you are preparing for the sun to rise. As the sun ascends you jog faster and faster until a sense of catharsis is experienced, and you experience an awakening by the Solar force. If you prefer a more formal approach, you can find the more traditional four daily Sun meditations in the various books on the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, or alternatively, you may like to use some of the Sun prayers found in works of Akhenaton and the Essenes. Hail unto Thee who art Ra in thy rising, even unto Thee who art Ra in thy strength, who travellest over the Heavens in thy bark at the uprising of the Sun. Liber Resh vel Helios Solar Practises Solar Practises There are other Solar practises which are important in the life of the Gnostic. These are based on the belief that if the Gnostic is in a state of spiritual regeneration, then it is possible to absorb more X factors by exposing yourself to Solar energy. It is important that during these exercises the focus is kept on the fullness of the Light world, this way the energies received are X not Y factors. Some simple techniques"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 124 that have proved useful are as follows, again make them your own. Find a comfortable place where you will not be interrupted, and where you are exposed to the sun. Do not perform it in the middle of the day, choose a sensible period when the heat is not too strong. Lie down either on a comfortable chair or the ground. Close your eyes, allow the suns rays to fall on the back of the eyes. Meditate on the light world, and visualise yourself absorbing the rays from the Sun. Do this for around 5-10 minutes, it can be increased to around 20 minutes, but not more each day. An interesting variation is to watch the inside of the eyelids and notice the strange colours and shapes formed by the light falling on the eyes. Visualise these as X factors entering the psychic system of the body and use your visualisation skills to form them into shapes and symbols. The emphasis here is the use of active visualisation method to increase the amount of X factor received. Conclusion Conclusion The Sun and all of matter are part of a mixed energy field. The lower worlds are a maze of destructive and constructive forces, light and darkness and carry the potential for liberation or dissolution. The forces that emanate through the sun offer opportunities for life or death, ascension or obliteration. Like the physical Sun, it can heal or hurt, it can scorch the earth or foster life. The world is a chessboard, on which the battle between light and darkness is played out, the physical world is both a cage and an opportunity for growth. On a practical level we may understand the world as a school or educational facility, through which we gain experience, and through this experience, hopefully awaken the innermost self. Various ideologies and perspectives are played off against each other through many incarnations offering a chance, a glimpse of immortality.

Esoteric practises such as meditation and visualisation are to be undertaken and by psychically refining the Chakras more X factors can be absorbed, and Y factors resisted.

The fundamentalist Christian concept of simply giving your life to Jesus is utterly alien to the teachings of the Gnosis. The process of being born again is just that, a process. Just as a child takes nine months from conception to birth so the process of being reborn takes a long period of time, perhaps even many lives. The moment of conception is that time when you decide to enter the Transfigurative Path. From that conception you begin to grow and transform from a person of the flesh, to a being of spirit, from a slave of the Archons to an Aeon of Light. For most of us, this transformation is not completed within our timeline (our allotted series of lives) and hence we have to wait until the end of the cosmic cycle, at which time the Transfigured finally return to the Treasury of Light. Accordingly, no one cannot actually be born again until the Omega Day, when those of the Pleroma are finally and irreversibly changed from Dialectic to Static substance. This is confirmed in 1 John 3:9 where we read... Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, for his seed remainth in him and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 1 John 3:9 There a number of key concepts in this verse. Firstly, the concept of “seed” is mentioned. This hints at the radical transformation of the Gnostic (a new seed has been propagated in him). Secondly, it is said that the seed of a reborn person cannot sin ! This is an incredible concept, if you are truly reborn you cannot sin. (Sin means to miss the mark, not to be in balance with the Light worlds, it does not mean the petty moral commandment of modern Christianity !) In real terms this means that a fully reborn person is permanently one with the Pleroma. Now surely this does not apply to modern fundamentalist Christians who are supposedly reborn by a quick prayer at a revival meeting !"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 127 No, being reborn is being transformed from one substance to another ! The Two Paths The Two Paths There are two paths within the process of Transfiguration. The first Path is known as the Terrestrial Path. (or that of the Dove), the second that of the Serpent (the Celestial Path). Before anyone can enter the Path of the Serpent of Wisdom (or the Celestial Path) they must have graduated from the Terrestrial path first. The Terrestrial Path is the path of rebirth for most Gnostics. It transforms the dialectic into the very substance of the Treasury of Light. In the New Testament it is the Path of the Called. In the secret teachings of Valentinus, those who enter the Path of the Dove are known as Psychics, while those who follow the secret Path of the Serpent are known as Pneumatics.

It is the final secret teaching revealed by Christ to James, his brother and then to the other Apostles. The teaching was the last stage of the continuing development of the Mystery teachings. The Mysteries are described in a range of New Testament books as The Mystery (Ephesians 3:3), The Mystery of Christ (Ephesians 3:4), The Great Mystery (Ephesians 5:32) and The Administration of the Mystery (Ephesians 3;9). This teaching was a special process for a unique class. Certain Gnostics would feel the call to move from the path of Terrestrial Salvation and enter a new phase of development, that of Celestial Deification. This is the nexus of the new specialised teaching, that some of the Gnostic brethren would be called to become part of the hierarchy itself, in other words, Gods themselves ! This special Path is known as the Celestial Path, the Path of the Serpent of Wisdom or The Path of the Chosen Ones. Initiates on this Path were known in the Cathar tradition as Parfait; or the Perfected Ones. This Secret doctrine or teaching has been known in many of the Orthodox Churches since the earliest of days, but has generally been understood by the Orthodox in a way that is very different from its original Gnostic meaning. Gods essence is inaccessible. His uncreated and eternal ener- gies (Glory, Light, Love) permeate the universe and make possible a personal union with man. In its worship the Church offers thanksgiving that God has opened the way for man to come to him and has made union with him possible. This is the Orthodox Churches' teaching of the deification (theosis) of man, a doctrine based on the Incarnation, which revealed a new perfect humanity.....This union is the goal of prayer and partici- pation in the Sacraments, it involves the co-operation of two wills, divine and human. In this union with God human beings become \"partakers of the divine nature\" (II Peter 1:4) without ceasing to be creatures. Other New Testament writers ex- pressed this union in terms of being or dwelling in Christ. The fathers of the Church as well as modern theologians recognised that deification as the goal of Christian life lies at the base of"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 130 the base of every important theological controversy in the history of the Orthodox Churches.

These will be few in number and the demands on them will be great. Their first task will the mastery of the Terrestrial Path, however, rather than reincarnat- ing to teach and assist, they will achieve perfection while doing the special tasks required by hierarchy of light. Some of these Perfected Ones will achieve a special state of limited perfection in the flesh, and become emissaries of the divine in their lifetimes. This path is a dangerous and demanding one for it goes beyond all the Laws, moral codes and ethics. The Mysteries are a very different from the traditional esoteric traditions, for the Mysteries includes no moral or ethical restrictions, as a man becomes part of God he will act as the voice of God directs. These Perfected Ones or Parfait as the Cathars called them, are few and far between. As it is all too easy for a man to claim immortality and perfection, it is another thing to actually achieve it. In many cases the Ecclesia themselves \"administered the Mysteries\", that is, they recognised or denied the state of Perfection to avoid charlatans and false prophets claiming the title without right.

It is a unique Priesthood and one available to all those of Israel. It is comprised, however, of four various levels or hierarchies. The four levels of the Melchizedek Priesthood are: Å First Born of Creation. Ç 144,000 Elders. É Celestial Class. Ñ Terrestrial Class. The First born of Creation is Michael who became Jesus himself. He is the High Priest and since the birth of the New Aeon (circa 1844-1904) is ministering in the heavenly Tabernacle preparing for the Omega Day (End Time). The 144,000 Elders are of a special class. They are the Overmen or Succeeders from the last cycle. They are a group who passed right through the seven phases of the previous Adamic evolutionary cycle and returned to the Pleroma. When they saw the destruction being reeked throughout our universe by the fall or Alpha Event, they elected to postpone their own development and return and incarnate on earth so as to assist the lost Adamic peoples. They are virginal in the sense that while they are incarnated in human bodies they are not of this cycle, they are the true firstfruits. Throughout history they have reincarnated as teachers, leaders, warriors and priests, they were the builders of the Great Pyramid in Egypt under Enoch, and will lead the Lost tribes of Israel in the End Times. And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.

Revelation 13:3-4 The Celestial Class are those who have reached perfection through the Transfigu- ration and achieved a state of Godhood. They continue to incarnate on earth, working with the Divine Will (Logos). At the Omega Day the 144,000, in conjunction with the Celestial Class, will fulfil the role of the \"Left Hand of God\", cleansing the planet in preparation for his return. They will be translated to become Immortals within the heavenly hierarchy. The Terrestrial Class are those who achieve perfection at the resurrection. They apply and follow the Gnostic principles through many lives as they transform from earthly to heavenly substance. They follow the Will of the Pleroma and are reborn as his children on the restored New Earth.

Revelation 21:1-4 The Seven Stages of Transfiguration The Seven Stages of Transfiguration The Path(s) of Transfiguration are divided into seven distinct steps. Å Re-orientation. Ç Re-Education. É Baptism. (Initiation). Ñ Anointing. (Holy Spirit). Ö Overcoming The Dialectic System. (Communion and Feasts). Ü Rebirth á Ascension. Re-orientation Re-orientation The word repentance rings in the ears of most of us who had the misfortune of being brought up in \"Christian traditions\". The problem is that most \"Christians\" have no knowledge of what the word really means ! There is this concept that repentance simply means saying “sorry”, in keeping with the traditions of most of western Christianity, you can do whatever you want, as long as you say sorry to God and receive his forgiveness. However, this is not what the Gnostic tradition (or for that matter the Bible) really says. Yes, there is forgiveness but Grace works in conjunction with Works. Salvation is a process through which the Treasury of Light works in conjunction with you ! It is not a one way street ! The actual term repentance means to turn about, to reverse, to change . It represent the stage at which an individual decides his life is going in the wrong direction and turns it"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 134 totally about. The term repentance in the Gnostic sense means to awaken to the fact that one's life; being, mind and emotions are chained within the World of the Archons and whatever ones does, one cannot escape. Only by entering the Path of Transfiguration can liberation be achieved.. The first step on the Path (Transfiguration) is to turn away, to repent, to give-up the ways of the world (The Dialectic field) and begin the journey to Redemption. This change of direction starts with the simple acknowledgement of Transfiguration, and by a conscious effort to start living the life of a true Gnostic. Detachment and Controlled Awareness Detachment and Controlled Awareness When Buddha said “all life is suffering” he wasn't joking ! The perceptiveness of Gautama Buddha's understanding of how the Dialectic system is perpetuated cannot be underestimated. As Buddha expressed in his four Noble truthes, all life is suffering because we become attached to what happens to us, and attachment leads to reaction, and reaction to attachment. Buddha's solution is interpreted by modern scholars of the Buddhist traditions (Himayana and Mahayana) to be total detachment. There is a problem however within this interpretation of Buddhism. If we understand that the Dialectic system is sustained by action and reaction, then total detachment and total attachment will both have ramifications and by logical deduction - reactions. If we see zero, or no linkage to the Dialectic system as the goal, then Detachment would be negative (-1) and attachment would be positive (+1), both entail actions and reactions. Many Gnostic schools apply western versions of Buddha's logic (especially those with a moralist orientation), the problem, however, is that when we attempt to totally detach from the world, the reaction is normally so strong, we end up in total attachment ! One of the early stages on the Path is that of \"Controlled Awareness\". Controlled Awareness is becoming totally aware of what is happening within us and around us. It involves realising that the process of rebirth involves the \"death\" of the old terrestrial mind and emotions, and the rebuilding of a new Self. Transfiguration awakens the real self, a Self we have never experienced, and one which is really us, and yet so alien - at first. Accordingly, the new Gnostic on the Path must"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 135 become aware of the changes that are occurring within him and observe and understand the reactions and actions that occur. The \"Controlled\" facet of the awareness is in the fact that the Gnostic must slowly learn to make decisions about what occurs in his mind and emotions. A pause must be created before an action is taken; an emotion is expressed; a behaviour is enacted, and a decision made regarding its value in light of the Spiritual Path. In some situations attachment will be the answer, in others detachment, the key is awareness, and the focus is on controlled decision making. Full detachment and full attachment are opposites and hence lead further into the Dialectic rather than away from it, total awareness is the answer. Study, Conviction and Emotion Study, Conviction and Emotion The structure of the psyche must also be taken into consideration. When we read in the Bible and Gnostic texts that we must have no other Elohim (Gods) but the I AM, this has important psychological ramifications. How many of us focus on careers, money, music, fame or a hundred and one diversions, rather than on our spiritual goal ? The true Gnostic must be focused on the Spiritual Path and nothing else. In the Gospels the allegory of giving up everything is used, obviously you are not expected to give away all your possessions, but you must have no other Gods, but the Lord of Wisdom, and your sole aim must be to reach the Treasury of Light. Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. Luke 18:22 Developing this thought we need to consider the role of the Mind (Ruach) and the Emotions (Nephesh) in our lives. For most of us, prior to entering the Path, our Lords are either the Mind or the Emotions. Yet on the spiritual path this cannot be so, the mind is a good scribe but a bad master, the emotions and the body are excellent followers but rotten leaders. The new Self which is awakening must take"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 136 control of the body (\"Put your House in Order\"), and a restored Mind and Emotions will take their rightful place beneath it. In the life of the Gnostic there should be a simple set of principles... Å Study should come first- study the Scriptures, the Gnostic texts and the Restored Gnostic keys. Ç Secular thinking and belief come second ! Logic and belief must be based on a firm foundation, the foundation of Self and the Lord of Wisdom. É Thirdly, and definitely only thirdly, comes the body and the emotions. Sure, look after the body, but do so with care ! Just because you wake up one morning feeling bad does not mean you have fallen off the spiritual path. Remember, the world is a trap, a Dialectic prison, and accordingly, indulgence (+1) or asceticism and mortification (-1), are both actions and reactions and accordingly are aspects of the prison we are caught in. Faith and Education Faith and Education One of the most important steps on the Path is that of education or more correctly, re-education. When the Gnostic begins to study the Bible with the Keys of the Mysteries, a whole new understanding will arise and will change the way he looks at the world forever. Study is one of the major facets of the Path of Transfiguration, and it leads to a radically different way of examining the world. This viewpoint is sometimes called faith, but is better described as Conviction. It is a worldview that grows out of the experience of the Gnosis. An experiential wisdom that the world is really a fallen place, and that we are being called home to another world, another dimension; another order of being. The process of re-education is constant, as it involves a battle. Everyday we are programmed with garbage from the Dialectic system. Television, radio, newspapers, novels, books, friends, family members...all offer us the wisdom of the world. Accordingly, everything we are fed enters into our minds and conflicts with the new developing Self."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 137 This is just the beginning ! Within everyone of us are false selves (Pseudomorphs), little identities created out of desires and unconscious materials (internal Archons). These false selves (like little Gods) demand attention and control. These little selves are made of unconscious desires and experiences, and hence, are \"restricted\" in focus and knowledge. They are extremely dangerous and destruc- tive. Little Gods of Self Hate, Lust, Narcissism, addictions, etc. control and cloud the mind and Nephesh. They refuse to allow us to live in the present, replaying past events and creating false associations between present events and the past. They control the mind to such an extent that the Voice of God (the Logos) cannot be heard, and we become lost within our internal fallen worlds. At the same time, the old Ruach (Mind) and Nephesh (emotions) are also false Gods, for their place is in submission to the awakened Self (True Self) not in domination of it. The structure of the True Man is like a chariot, the body is the Chariot itself, riding in it is the True Self, the mind is the reins and the Horses are the emotions. Only when these constituents are in their rightful place does the chariot travel in the right direction. The horses are good at their given task, but very bad drivers ! So all things must be in their place, this is the task of Transfiguration. The process of re-education involves a long and arduous battle, in which the old \"Gods\" must die and a new God is born. The Mind and Emotions are destroyed in the Dark Nights of initiation (see section below on the Dark Night of the Soul for details), and a new mind/emotion complex is formed under the directions of the True Self. Like Osiris we must rise from the death of our old selves into the new. Lord, I die daily. 1 Corinthians 15:30 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. 2 Corinthians 5:17"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 138 Baptism, Initiation and The Anointing Baptism, Initiation and The Anointing He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. Luke 3:3 Baptism (or immersion into water) represents the first Initiation on the spiritual Path. It is a ritual recognition of the process of rebirth which has been initiated. The rite itself is not the same as the rite of Christening (there is no Gnostic rite for the initiation of minors). The rite of baptism is by full immersion into water, and represents the descent of the “old man” into death (the water) and rebirth as a new creation. This can be readily seen from Luke 3:3, where Baptism is specifically referred to as the Baptism of Repentance. Repentance (as discussed earlier) involves a radical change of life direction, and hence can only be recognised in someone of mature age. Baptism is the first of the Seven Sacraments used by the Gnostic Church. The rite is only available to those who have entered the Path of Transfiguration. Baptism is one of three Initiations offered by the Gnostic Ecclesia: Baptism by Water, Anointing with the Holy Spirit and Celestial Confirmation. As can be seen from the verse below there are two distinct forms of Baptism, both of which are available to those on the Terrestrial Path. There is the Baptism of repentance (known in the Bible as the Baptism of Water or John's Baptism), and there is the Baptism or Anointing with the Holy Spirit or Fire. (The Baptism of the Holy Spirit). The Third Initiation, that of the Celestial Class is a unique rite (not a Baptism) and one we will not elaborate upon in this study. So Paul asked, \"Then what baptism did you receive?\" \"John's baptism,\" they replied. Paul said, \"John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\" On hearing this, they were baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus. Acts 19:3-5"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 139 The Anointing of the Holy Spirit is the Baptism with Fire. It is not given with the Baptism of repentance, but is offered later on the spiritual path. As the Baptism of repentance is recognition of starting the spiritual path, the Baptism of Fire is recognition of a certain degree of achievement, and is stimulus for further growth. The Baptism of water symbolises the start of the work of Sophia in cleansing the life of the student, it also initiates the growth of the Light Spark in the Gnostic. The Baptism of fire recognises the growing Spark of Light and accelerates the destruction of the \"Old Man\" within the Gnostic being. As the Spark of Light grows it attempts to commune with the Mind of God (Logos) to which the Gnostic now has access, however, sin (Dialectic facets) block the way. As the initiate evolves Sophia purifies and destroys the blockages between the Self and the Logos. This process is recognised and accelerated by the Initiation of Fire. The Spirit baptism also recog- nises the new Mind and emotions through which the New Man is being formed. Accordingly, as Sophia imparts new gifts and powers. It should be noted that since this Baptism initiates new aspects of the Transfiguration process, it should be only offered to mature Gnostics. A Gnostic just on the path, so to speak, by taking this Baptism can bring on internal experiences beyond his maturity. It is no use destroying the mind and emotion until you are ready to relinquish control of them to the new you ! There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men. Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 140 All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines. 1 Corinthians 12:4-11 When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. Acts 8:15-17. Many may argue against separate Baptisms of water and fire and yet clearly in the Book of Acts we have a discussion of the difference between the Baptism in the name of Jesus, and the baptism of the Holy Spirit. This also leads us to an understanding of the esoteric meaning of the name Jesus and the Christ. Jesus as a symbol represents the human principle. In Gnostic literature the name Jesus was symbolic of the spiritually disciplined life, hence, Baptism in the name of Jesus is the first Baptism, that of water, discipline and repentance. The Second baptism (or anointing) is that of Fire, it is the Christ Baptism. At this baptism Sophia breaks down the barriers between the New awakened Self (Pneumatic Spark) and the Logos and the Gnostic enters into communion with the Mind of God. In other words, the Lord of Wisdom is present in his soul, he is Christed. Now I realise many traditional Christians (and others) will argue that the Holy Spirit cannot do any harm, it is the spirit of love, and hence these baptisms can be given together. But this is just not so, if we continue to read the account in Acts chapter eight, when Simon tries to purchase the power of the Holy Spirit, he is cursed with death, he becomes so terrified he asks the disciples to pray and protect him from its power ! In Acts chapter 5 we read of Ananias, who in trying to deceive the Holy Spirit was"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 141 killed by the power of God. In addition to these comments we may also note that the only sin that cannot be forgiven is the \"Sin against the Holy Spirit\" (Mark 3:29). Accordingly, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit or Fire should not be taken lightly. An interesting note on Baptism is found in the Strong's Exhaustive concordance where it is considering the difference between two Greek words used for Baptism. Baptizo and Bapto. The note is from the Bible Study magazine (James Montgomery Brice, May 1989). The term used specifically in the New Testament for Baptism is Baptizo... 907 baptizo {bap-tid'-zo} Not to be confused with 911, bapto. The clearest example that shows the meaning of baptizo is a text from the Greek poet and physician Nicander, who lived about 200 B.C. It is a recipe for making pickles and is helpful because it uses both words. Nicander says that in order to make a pickle, the vegetable should first be 'dipped' (bapto) into boiling water and then 'baptised' (baptizo) in the vinegar solution. Both verbs concern the immersing of vegetables in a solution. But the first is temporary. The second, the act of baptising the vegetable, produces a permanent change. When used in the New Testament, this word more often refers to our union and identification with Christ than to our water baptism. e.g. Mark 16:16. 'He that believes and is baptised shall be saved'. Christ is saying that mere intellectual assent is not enough. There must be a union with him, a real change, like the vegetable to the pickle!"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 142 Living the Life of a Gnostic: Living the Life of a Gnostic: Overcoming The Dialectic System Overcoming The Dialectic System In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 2 Timothy 3:12 Another facet of the Path of Transfiguration is Living the Life. The Dialectic system is an enemy against which we fight. As we experience more and more of the power of the Light Kingdoms, then we will battle incessantly against the fallen minions. In fact, anyone who is on the spiritual path will feel the power of the Archons and have to battle against them. As recommendations for the battle, the Treasury of Light offers many guide-lines, these include... Å Keeping the Sacred Law. Ç Separation from the World. É Fellowship. Ñ The Festivals. (Alignment with the Treasury Currents). Each of these can offer assistance on our spiritual path. The sacred Laws offer guidance in how we should deal with ourselves, and those around us. Separation from the world is of paramount importance. While it is difficult to apply this today, it is abundantly clear that we are keep to our own paths, avoid social contact with those not of the Gnosis, and sustain our focus on our own tradition. The term fellowship means association, community, communion, joint participation, intercourse, the share which one has in anything, participation, the right hand as a sign and pledge of fellowship (Strong's Exhaustive Concordance). It is not simply social gathering or friendship, but a communion of those of similar heritage and of similar belief. Fellowship certainly assists many on the Spiritual path. who find the"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 143 quest difficult and isolated. However, it is only of value insomuch that the fellowship itself conforms to the dictates of the Gnostic tradition. Fellowship with the fallen brings destruction. The Festivals The Festivals The Festivals of Light offer a method of aligning oneself with the Treasury of Light. The festivals are based on agrarian imagery and are therefore aligned with the purity of Pre-Fall man. They celebrate the ebb and flow of the spiritual worlds, and by aligning with them slowly transform our essence from Dialectic to Static. While an extensive study will be made of the festivals, in both theory and practice, in later volumes, it is useful to appreciate their juxtaposition with festivals of the World. The Feasts of Light celebrate the liberation of man from matter, while traditional earth festivals used in most Pagan traditions focus on the worship of the earth itself. Earth systems focus on the death and resurrection of the earth and by default make the celebrator subservient to the earth. Gnostic festivals focus on the death of the Dialectic and resurrection of the Static, and by default make the celebrant tri- umphant over earth and a partaker of the powers of Light. Life on the Path Life on the Path Life on the Path is difficult, it is a battle between the things of the world and the Treasury of Light. In the Gnostic traditions there are many descriptions of this battle and what it entails. Within the modern esoteric traditions this battle is posited in terms of a force called the \"Dweller on the Threshold\". The dweller guards the crossroad between the World of the Archons and the Treasury of light and as the Gnostic approaches this doorway attacks him without mercy, only those truly on the path survive. Some Gnostic systems consider this process as a cosmic trek through the planets, where at each planet the soul needs special passwords and gestures to gain a \"rite of passage\". For others, this battle is seen in terms of an internal quest. For St.John of the Cross, this process was part of the ascent of Mount Carmel, where the Soul would meet its maker.

Dark Night of the Soul, St.John of the Cross (N2,7,3) Clarifying introduction in brackets ours. In whatever form the Dark Night is experienced it is terrifying. It occurs in the spiritual trek which all who follow the Path undertake. After the initial excitement of entering the Path, and starting the spiritual quest, doubts arise, fears, dreams, terrors, a feeling of abandonment, an inability to study, meditate or concentrate. It is during this period that the \"old\" mind and emotions are destroyed, so feelings of death and rebirth are not uncommon. It is a truly shattering occurrence. However, it will be experienced many times along the spiritual path, as the lower vehicles are transformed and the New Self grows. An excellent description of this process is found in Alchemical literature. For the Alchemists the product that was being transformed into Gold was man himself, and the procedures reflected the spiritual Path. The life of the Gnostic on the Path, involves the total transformation of the individual from one substance (Dialectic) to another, (Static) and accordingly, involves the greatest revolution in consciousness possible. This transformation cannot be readily expressed in words but needs to be experienced. An interesting description of the transformation is given by the German Philosopher Fredrich Nietszche, when he discusses the process of \"overcoming man\" and becoming the Overman, comparing the gap between Man (Dialectic Man) and the Overman (Static Man) in the following terms...."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 145 I teach you the Overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him ? All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flow and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man ? What is the ape to man ? A laughing stock or painful embar- rassment. And man shall be just that for the Overman; A laughing stock or a painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man; and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape. X"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 146 The mind must be totally transformed, it is not enough to simply take on new beliefs. So many would-be Gnostics seem to accept the Gnostic worldview but try and live in the same old way, this is simply not good enough. To enter the Path, to experience Transfiguration - is to transform. The old mind with its associated complexes, reactions and emotions must be dealt with - a new mind, and a new man is needed. We must realise that when we enter the path of Transfiguration the mind does not change immediately and there is no flash of illumination and all is well. The unconscious is still full of Engrams and the emotions are still tainted. If you took a group of people out of civilisation and put them in a desert, asking them to build a new society, after years of work you would find, to your horror, another form of the old civilisation, with all the same evils and all the same problems. The form may change but things stay the same. The task of the Gnostic is to transform the psyche. Within the Institute for Gnostic Studies we have been working on techniques to achieve this goal. We have called these techniques Psychogenesis - psycho meaning mind and genesis denoting beginnings. Psychogenesis thus means the beginning of the mind. In the terms of the gnosis it means the beginning of a new mind or the creation of the soul. To introduce you to Psychogenesis, we will examine some basic techniques that have proved valuable. The Gnostic Diary The Gnostic Diary The Gnostic diary is a book or folder in which you record your experiences, aspirations and thoughts on a daily basis. In it you should record your successes and failures, your battles with the “world”, both inner and outer and your spiritual practises. On a regular basis you should go over what you have written (monthly is a good idea) and analyse what has occurred in your life. It should be kept totally private, shared with no one and in it you should be totally honest. The Gnostic diary"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 147 is a useful way to keep track of your transformation. In more romantic times it was known as the “Book of Shadows” and the “magicians diary”; for us, it has a more practical value. While there are more than enough books on the market describing the process of keeping a spiritual diary, it is important to stress its value and discuss some ways in which it can be used. Dream Work Dream Work Probably one of the more practical uses of your diary is for dream analysis. It is a good idea to keep your diary by your bed and record your dreams each night. If you find you are having a particularly difficult time in your spiritual life, set an alarm clock for early in the morning (3 or 4 am) and record your dreams when you awake. Dreams are the unconscious’ way of communicating with the conscious mind, use them to your advantage. When it comes to interpreting your dreams there are no quick answers. Meditating on your dreams can help, as can reading available dream interpretation books, though the “quick dream interpretation cook-books” are of little value. A relevant comment to make here is that while dreams use symbols which may have common meanings many of the images will only mean something to you and hence you are the key to their understanding. So for example, while a snake may have a more general phallic interpretation or may even mean wisdom, if you were bitten by a snake as a child it is more likely to have a personal connection, rather than the more generalised interpretation. Some Diary techniques Some Diary techniques There are many techniques for using your diary in a creative way. A couple we will cover here are Elemental Self Analysis and Identity work. For Elemental Self Analysis take four pages in your dairy and mark them with the titles of the four elements. Each day for one month sit down and consider your personality, be brutally honest with yourself. List your various personality traits and list them under the element you think they should be related to. For example, enthusiasm may be related to fire, and over-emotionalism to water. Even when you feel there is no more to write keep going, consider all major and minor aspects of yourself, good and bad, known and secret and classify them. At the end of the month make some master lists"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 148 of what you have found, consider the following questions... Under what element are most of my personality traits ? Under what element are most of my negative traits ? Under what element are most of my positive traits ? After you have done this ask some of your friends (ones you can trust) what personality traits they find notable about you, both good and bad. Add these to your lists, but in red. Ask yourself the above questions again and compare what other perceive about you and what you perceive about yourself. When you feel you have learnt enough about yourself date the exercise and return to your normal spiritual practises. It is sometimes useful to repeat this again at twelve months intervals comparing the results. Another useful diary exercise is to make a number of pages with the following heading - What do I want to be ? What do I want to change ? What do I want to develop ? Over a period of a month write on these pages your answers to each question. Do not read over what you have written the day before, just keep writing your answers and perceptions. At the end of the month read over your lists, cross out repetitions and classify what you find. Prepare summary lists, and phrase the answers into affirmations. For example, “I would like to read more” could be turned into “I will read more”. These affirmations can now be added into your morning meditations and should be integrated into your daily goal program. If you decide you should read more, then you should write a note in your schedule so that everyday you set"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 149 aside more time for reading. These are just a few ideas about how you can use your diary, there are lots more possibilities and many books available outlining exer- cises and techniques. Read them and develop your own techniques which suit you personal temperament and experience. Relaxation Relaxation There is a lot of baloney said about relaxation today. It seems everybody is convinced that stress is their enemy and that we must all relax more. The problem is that the more we relax the less we get done. Stress is a motivator and has a valuable role in everyday life. Relaxation is useful, in its place, and I certainly suggest the budding Gnostic learn the various techniques of relaxation. Again, there are lots of books on relaxation (too many !) and, hence, you don’t need a detailed study here. What I would suggest is that rather than reading about relaxation or buying one of those “new age” relaxation tapes, you create you own methods of relaxation. We can divide ways to relax into two different forms, Muscular Relaxation and Auto Suggestion. Muscular Relaxation is based on tensing the various muscles in the body, feeling and noting the stress and then relaxing it. This conscious process of tension, hold, relaxation works well. Auto Suggestion is another way to do things. In this technique you visualise things that make your relax - fields, forests, countryside. You may also visualise images that have a particular relaxing effect such as spirals, clouds and water. The best technique is a personal combination of both of these methods, a simple relaxation method may be like the one below. Å Find a nice place to lie down, turn off the phone and any noisy appliances, make sure you won’t be disturbed, unplug the phone. Ç Put on some nice music, something that is calming and something you like. Close your eyes, keep your eyes closed during the technique. É Start by noting the amount of tension in your body. Tense every muscle you can, all at once, feel the tension. Hold it until it becomes a little uncomfortable, then relax the muscles with a big out-breath. Ñ Start working through the muscles in the body, concentrate on each separate set of muscles. For example, tense the right leg, hold the tension, notice the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 150 tension, relax the muscle. As you relax each muscle give an out-breath. Some people like to add an affirmation here, such as “It feels good to be relaxed”, other people feel stupid doing this, it is up to you. Ö After your have worked through all the muscles of the body shake yourself and make sure you are relaxed. If there is any tension left go back to that area and do the technique again. Ü Sense the relaxation of the muscles, and make yourself comfortable where you are sitting. Notice the blackness before your closed eyes, visualise a spiral in front of you. See it spinning, sense yourself falling into the spiral and falling deeper and deeper into the depths of the relaxed state. You can add some colour to the spiral if you like, blues and greens are normally particularly relaxing. á As you feel yourself becoming more relaxed, visualise a time in your past where you were very relaxed. If you cannot remember such a time, choose a location where you would be very relaxed, perhaps a countryside or forest location. Sense the feeling of relaxation. Encourage your experience of the scene, notice colours, smells, sense the wind. à As your are feeling more and more relaxed notice more things about your scene, perhaps you are lying on the grass, then sense the touch of the grass, feel yourself sinking into it. Notice the sky, watch the clouds floating by, notice how big, white and fluffy they are. â If you feel you are now relaxed enough by now then again see the spiral and say to yourself, as “I count from ten to one I will become totally relaxed”, then count yourself down. Ten, more relaxed, nine, relaxing etc., between each number and the next affirm you are relaxing. ä When you are fully relaxed you can either just enjoy it, probably a good idea for the first few time or undertake some spiritual work. Affirmations are useful here, for example, you may wish to repeat some of the “things I want to develop” from our early exercise. Affirmations should be in a positive frame where possible (I wish to be healthy and slim not I wish to lose weight) and given in short phases. Ä To awaken, slowly move the body and bring awareness back to the muscles, sit up. Turn off the music, turn on the phone and return."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 151 In the above technique we used a range of visualisations, these are an important part of Gnostic practise and we need to consider their value and use. Pranayama and Relaxation Pranayama and Relaxation As an adjunct to relaxation, Pranayama (or Breath control) is a useful art to master. Since the breath is saturated with psychic energy techniques which control and use, the breath can prove of value. A simple Pranayama technique which combines well with meditation is called “breath watching”. This is a simple meditation where you breathe rhythmically in a four - four - four pattern - breath in for four, hold for four and breathe out for four. At the same time keep your concentration on your breath, ignore any thoughts, as they arrive let them float away, if your attention wanders, bring it back to your breath. This is a simple technique, but valuable in the early stages of learning to relax and meditate. As you become more proficient, you can combine this with visualisations, see clear pure blue energy coming in with the in breath and dirty blue exiting with the out-breath. There is no limit to the variations. The Art of Visualisation The Art of Visualisation Everyone has in their minds a screen that can be understood to be something like a cinema or television screen. On this screen appears images and pictures of everything we see in everyday life. We don’t see these images as they go too fast, however, if you sit quietly and consider something that has recently occurred you can replay the scene. You will notice that not only can you witness the scene, but you can also, sometimes, hear what is being said, smell, taste even touch what is occurring. These perceptions vary greatly from person to person, some people only hear, some only see, but through practise we can experience all senses related to these events. The screen in the mind is really an interface to a number of different systems, it serves as the recording mechanism from which data is then relayed to various memory banks to be recorded. The conscious mind does the recording, the unconscious does the storing. In the unconscious mind there are various libraries in which everything that goes across the screen is stored. In practical terms these can be divided into two forms - Standard Memories and Engrams. Standard Memories are those which have no destructive emotional content, while Engrams are events"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 152 which are charged with negative emotions. This is a simplistic definition, but will serve us for now. The screen is the interface through which we can explore the mind, it is timeless, and can be used to travel along the “timeline” which is created by our memories and experiences. Through visualisation we can influence what is projected on the screen and by extension explore and change both Standard Memories and Engrams. The art of visualisation involves three processes.. Å The ability to see clearly the images and pictures on the mind screen, and be able to hold these images for a specified period of time. Ç The ability to explore the various sense perceptions of images on the screen including sight, touch, smell, taste etc. É The ability to program images that appear on the mind screen so that data can be transferred to the unconscious and the ability to retrieve data from the uncon- scious and explore it on the mind screen. It is important at this stage to state that all people visualise. Some people see better than others, some people experience different senses to others, but all people in some way or another visualise. It is important for the Gnostic to refine their visualisation skills, because it is through this mind screen that advanced procedures of Psychogenesis are enacted. It is through this mind screen that the unconscious can be explored, Engrams reprocessed and programs implanted. The first step to improving visualisation is through a range of simple visualisation techniques, many of these are deceptively simple at first examination, but will take some time to master."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 153 Some Simple Visualisation Techniques Some Simple Visualisation Techniques Kim’s Game Kim’s Game This is a simple method of memory training which relies heavily on visualisation skills. It is useful as it trains both the memory and visualising abilities. On a tray place ten objects, stare at them for around thirty seconds, then cover the tray. Attempt to remember what the objects were, write down your answers and then confirm them against the objects on the tray. As your experiment with this technique, vary the objects, the number of objects and the time you have to see them and remember them. As you become more proficient start experimenting with remembering more about the objects. What colour are they, what shape are they, create descriptions of each etc. Heightened Awareness Heightened Awareness Choose an object to examine. A piece of fruit is a good choice to start. Stare at the object, notice everything you can about it - colour, size, texture, shadows etc. Then close your eyes and attempt to recreate the image on the minds screen. Practise this until the object becomes as clear as the real thing, check the visualise image against the original object, note any variations - correct them. As you become proficient, go on to more complex objects, then perhaps try people and buildings.... Retracing your steps Retracing your steps Play back an event that occurred earlier during the day. Perhaps an event such as going to the store. On your minds screen replay the journey, notice everything you can about the trip, replay the conversations that occurred, remember every detail you can. Do this exercise again but choose an event that is often repeated, like going to work. Replay the journey each night until you get it totally clear, focus on the visuals first, then expand the focus to sounds, senses etc. Get the image as clear as possible."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 154 Archetypal Explorations Archetypal Explorations Symbols have meaning. These meanings can vary from the personal to the collective unconscious and beyond. Jung believed that many symbols were part of an archetypal language through which varying levels of the unconscious communi- cated. On a personal level these symbols can be relevant in exploring Engrams and memories, on deeper levels these symbols can represent levels of personal and interpersonal spiritual power. When examining a symbol it is important to consider the various levels on which it can operate. Take for example, the snake; it can have significance on varying levels of the unconscious. It can represent a symbol of the phallus, a symbol of personal power, then on deeper levels, it can mean evil (within a Judeo-Christian symbol system) or wisdom (in Eastern and Gnostic systems). As can be readily appreciated, a symbol can represent opposing things, depending on the facet of the unconscious. The snake will mean different things depending on whether it seen from the perspective of Eggregore (artificial group mind) or an Archetype (group soul). Through visualisation, symbols can be doorways to great reserves of power, through them you can explore Eggregores and Archetypes. The first step in this process is to do some background reading, study the works of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, and gain a good working knowledge of the theories regarding dream interpretation, the nature of symbols and in the case of Jung - the Collective Unconscious and Archetypes. Then start experimenting with various symbols, consider such images as the Pentagram, Hexagram, Elemental symbols, even religious images and icons. Explore These on various levels, first intellectu- ally, look at your own reactions to the symbol, other people’s reactions, traditional attitudes etc. Then project it onto your mind screen, see it, move around it, spin it around, explore it. Then, turn it into a doorway, and go through it. There is a whole world waiting within symbols and images. Meditation and Concentration Meditation and Concentration To start our consideration of meditation and concentration, it would probably help if we offered a definition of both terms. Meditation is the art of going within and, by extension, learning to control the mind. Concentration is the art of holding onto and sustaining attention. Both are valuable tools in Gnostic practise."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 155 Meditation causes the mind to erupt, it becomes like a wild storm, and only through perseverance will it be possible (over a long period of time) to bring the mind under control. The aim of meditation and concentration is to bring the mind under the under the dominion of the True Self, it is a process full of difficulties and problems, and requires long term methodical practise to achieve. The average mind is like an ocean during a storm where the waters are violently agitated, each gust of wind is a storm of passion or desire or of a duty that must be accomplished or one hundred and one other irritations or anxieties and detours of the mind to which proper concentration is the cure. Guruni Varamei There are many different forms of meditative and concentrative practise, we have found three of these to be of particular value in Gnostic practise. Å Meditative and Concentrative silence. Ç The use of Mantras É Programmed meditation and concentration. Meditative and Concentrative Silence Meditative and Concentrative Silence There is a sanctuary of holy quiet within you, a place where God reigns supreme. Here God thinks his thoughts through you, your mind is inspired with knowledge, your eyes are opened to a new vision; your eyes are attuned to the voice of wisdom;your lips are sealed against idle words; your body temple is hallowed by the divine presence. The silence is the “pearl of great value” for when you are really silent before God - when your mind is cleared of personal desire and is ready, receptive, waiting, when your heart is hushed to all except the love of God - then you are made God conscious. Unity School of Christianity."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 156 The above thought, though written from the perspective of mystical Christianity, reflects the importance of inner silence as a method for communing with the Inner will. In mystical religious traditions (such as the Quakers) this will is identified with God or a given deity’s presence. For the Gnostic we appreciate that in silence we contact both our inner selves and the divine. The use of silence as a form of meditation is simple. Place yourself in an environment that will not permit interruptions and sit in a position that is comfort- able and can be held for a period of time. It is probably better not to lie down, as this tends to encourage sleeping rather than silence. Allow yourself to relax, perhaps undertake relaxation exercises. As you start to relax, the mind will start to react, random thoughts will start to stampede their way across your consciousness, images will cloud the mind screen. Instead of fighting or suppressing these experiences let them flow past you and disappear. Try not and let them interrupt your mediation. At first your attention will wander and you will have to bring you attention back to the silence. Each time this occurs is called a break, traditionally there are five types of breaks. Å Å Physical. These sort of breaks are when the body reacts to the position it is in. The most reliable way of dealing with this sort of break is through conditioning the body so it is used to such activities, Asana is a good idea. Ç Ç Thought. These sort of breaks are caused by the mind wandering. One of the most common forms of thought breaks are when we go over arguments, problems and situations which have occurred in the past. (The “what if ?” is common here). The only remedy to this sort of break is perseverance. É É Daydreams . The daydream break is particularly hard to control since it tends to have ended"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 157 before you actually consciously realise it started ! Again perseverance is the answer. Ñ Ñ Aberration of Control. This sort of break is a very insidious form. It takes place when you start thinking about how well you are doing and experience a state of satisfaction with the state you have reached. This false form of achievement is yet another break, the solution ? Keep on meditating. Ö Ö The Result Itself. This is when the break is a form of Cosmic Consciousness. This is the state when the True Self is able to communicate unimpeded through the trained psyche. The Use of Mantras The Use of Mantras One of the greatest tools in meditation is the Mantra. The term Mantra is Sanskrit, and literally means “that which liberates the mind”. In common usage it designates a certain word or phase continually repeated that brings about an altered state of awareness. The first effect of a Mantra is usually the opposite to what is expected, it is akin to the sting of a scorpion, the mind reacts by developing crazy thoughts, wandering images and even headaches and mysterious emotions. If you persevere however, these mysterious symptoms will vanish as quickly as they came, the mind will relax and the journey itself will begin. You will still have many difficulties (breaks just like those above will occur), but generally Mantra meditation is an easier path than Silence. There are different perspectives on the choice of a Mantra, some schools prefer the Mantras to have no meaning whatsoever, other suggest it should be a term which is loaded with religious meaning. Even many of the prayers used in Christian mysticism have in some sense become Mantras. There are many good books discussing Mantra meditation, and we suggest you study these and choose a Mantra which suits you. It is important that you feel comfortable with the Mantra, and can easily pronounce it and repeat it. When you start with a Mantra it is not wise to change midstream. Some common Mantras include the ever famous Hare Krishna, AUM, IAO and Aum Mani Padme Hum."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 158 Programmed Meditation and Concentration Programmed Meditation and Concentration This form of meditation uses a combination of relaxation techniques, visualisation and Pranayama. It is the process where the mind is taken into a relaxed state through any variation of techniques. As you go further into relaxation, visualisation is used to deepen the state in conjunction with breath techniques. When you are in the deepest possible state of relaxation, then you can begin your spiritual work. Instead of creating a relaxing environment alone, you can explore symbols; whole worlds or dimensions. For example, after you have visualised your countryside, then see a symbol cut into a stone wall, walk through it and explore. A useful experiment is to explore the images of the four elements and astrological signs and come to your own understanding of each. .It is sometimes useful to have a tape recorder on and record what you experience, though talking while in a relaxed state can take some practise. These are just some of the basic techniques of Psychogenesis. The Institute is working on a number of manuals outlining the advanced processes of the Psycho- genesis approach. However, for the meantime, we will include various introductory articles and processes within the courses presently available. X"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 159 Definitions Definitions Ceremony . A formal act to emphasise a specific occasion. Ritual . A formal act to achieve a specific purpose. Ritual and ceremony are forms of intellectual decompression. They lower the resistance of the conscious mind and unconscious filters (Engrams), so that a gateway can be formed within the ritual environment. This gateway can lead to the upper or lower facets of the human psyche, or to external dimensions and their related hierarchies and denizens. It is important to realise that ritual can work in both a subjective and objective manner, and has a valued place in both psychologi- cal and transhuman occult activity. The mechanism of ceremony and ritual is in its ability to limit the interference of the mind and earth Eggregores, so that contact with the desired forces can be made. For the Gnostic, ritual allows the True Self time to work unimpeded in the consciousness of the evolving soul (psyche). Ritual can have many varied uses, it can be used to explore the unconscious or delve into other dimensions of reality, it can be used to process psychological aggregates such as Engrams or Archetypes and to contact Demons, Gods or Spirits. Ritual offers a “vehicle” for a temporary change of reality, a place where we may transform our experience of the world; and possibly even the world itself. There are three basic types of ritual and ceremony. Å Å Instinctive Rituals. These types of ritual are best illustrated by animal behaviour. Animals behave in certain ways due to instinct, with little cognitive content. While much animal"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 160 behaviour is learned, it is still a form of mimicry rather than conscious behavioural choices. A classic example of this is found in the canine submission rituals. When attacked, a dog will roll on its back exposing its stomach, by leaving itself open to its attacker, clearly communicating his submission. Ç Ç Intuitive Rituals. These are the rituals in our lives which take place spontaneously. A mundane example may be when we “jump for joy” or curl up in a foetal when depressed. While not consciously chosen these intuitive rites represent unconscious forms of expression. Another form of intuitive ritual is when we feel drawn to a certain practise or meditation, but we don’t know why. Sometimes intuitive ritual offers a way in which the Higher Self guides us to more formal practises. É É Programmed Rituals Programmed rituals are the ones we are most interested in. They involve formulating a rite for a specific purpose and demand the disciplined use of both unconscious and external spiritual forces. A pre-requisite for the use of programmed ritual is a thorough knowledge of your own spiritual, mental and physical disposition. The Purpose of Ritual and Ceremony The Purpose of Ritual and Ceremony There can be many reasons for the use of ritual and ceremony - some good, some bad. The use of ritual as a game or as entertainment is definitely out of the question. Rituals should not have guests, either the participants join in the working or they do not attend. Five good reasons for the use of ritual and ceremony are.. Å Å To fix events in the unconscious. Particularly in ceremonial practise certain events in a given time frame are found to be important. These may be individual events or religious festivals and dates. Through the correct use of ceremony these events can be linked into unconscious Archetypes, so that at these times certain changes in consciousness result."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 161 Ç Ç To rectify unconscious forces. Since symbols are the language of the unconscious, it is possible to rectify the fallen and distorted aspects of the unconscious through ritual practise. While many Gnostics prefer a more psychological approach (such as Psychogenesis), the ritual methods should be not ignored. They are extremely efficient as well as potent. Engrams can be evoked and re-integrated (or banished), Archetypes can be evoked and internal and external forces can be used to stimulate the transformation of the Gnostic. É É Exploration and Discipline. Since an important of Transfiguration is the transformation of the human psyche and its reconditioning into a useful Scribe and Adept. Ritual and ceremony can have an important role to play in self exploration and discipline. The power of the untrained mind cannot be overestimated, and hence, ritual exploration can help us face aspects of ourselves we would rather ignore. Ñ Ñ Inducing altered states. A major part of ritual practise is inducing altered states of consciousness. Ritual forms a safe and structured method through which altered states may be achieved, integrated and balanced. Ö Ö Trans-human communication. Ritual and ceremony is not all in the mind. Correctly performed ritual can be used as a means to open communication with forces beyond the human condition. These forces were traditionally seen as Demons and Gods (Archons and Aeons), whatever their classification this sort of working must be handled with care. The Basic Elements of Ritual and Ceremony The Basic Elements of Ritual and Ceremony Gestures and Movements Gestures and Movements In every ritual and ceremony gesture and movement is of great importance and sig- nificance. In Vedic practise, for example, every hand gesture (or Mudra) embodies"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 162 a certain force or energy. Even dance can be used for evocation. In Siva’s Cosmic Dance there are 108 poses which embody his nature and invoke the inherent power involved. In individual ritual practise gestures are develop which reflect certain en- ergies, powers and states of mind. This is not as strange as it first seems. In recent research into the nature of the mind, the founders of Neuro-Linguistic Programming found that it is possible to associate certain emotions with hand gestures and move- ments. A bit like the work of Pavlov (the dog salivates when he hears the bell, be- cause the bell is associated with food), but going much further. The founders of NLP found how easy it was to lock emotions into certain gestures. This, surely, is the basis for the age old use of Mudra (hand movement) and gestures in occult practise. There are many ancient traditions that use such methods of gesture and movement including; Asana and Mudra in Yoga, Runic postures and the hand let- ters of the Israelite priesthood. Dress and Ritual Materials Dress and Ritual Materials The clothing of the ritualist can vary according to rite and to tradition. It can be very elaborate such as the ritual clothes worn in the Temple of Solomon or even nothing at all such as in the Skyclad (naked) tradition of some schools of natural ritualism and Wicca. In Gnostic ritualism a white robe is normally worn by the Psychic and a black robe by the Pneumatic. In some rites a smaller over-robe is sometimes worn. It varies in colour depending on the ritual. Other materials can include altar pieces, hangings and banners of the four elements. All of these help impress the mind that this is a special occasion, and that symbols need to be processed in a different manner. Robes are important for they disassociate the wearer from everyday situations and focus on the special nature of the ritual. Tools Tools There is much debate about what tools are needed for ritual practise. Again, these can vary greatly from tradition to tradition and also depend on the nature of the rite. In the more formal school of Western Ceremonial Magic, there are four tools. These four tools are related to the four elements with the fifth, or spirit, being the Gnostic himself."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 163 The Wand. Fire. The Wand is used as an extension of the will or intent of the Gnostic. It concentrates the energies of the rite and is used extensively with rites of Invocation and Evocation. The Chalice. Water. The Chalice is the projection of the intuition of the Gnostic. It has many uses includ- ing offerings and the Eucharist within the Gnostic Liturgy. The Dagger. Air. The dagger or small blade is the projection of the Intellect. In some rites it is ex- changed for a Sword. It is used to contain energies and create sigils and signs. The Pentacle. Earth. The Pentacle is the symbol of the body or physical form. It is used to earth the pow- ers that are invoked, at times it is exchanged for a bowl of salt and water. There are many other accessories which can be used in ritual practise, in some sense it is up to you to decide what tools you want to use, and how to use them. Incense. Incense purifies the air and sets the mood. It can also be used for the manifestation of spiritual forces and projection of images. Candles.

Ritual Structure Ritual Structure There are many different procedures for rituals and ceremonies, some use Liturgy and high religious language, others use more physical and direct methods. In all rituals, regardless of form, certain characteristics can be noted that are the core structure within any given rite. Location Location The location is an important part of the rite. A location should be chosen which is private and accessible only by those to whom the rite is addressed. Prior to this stage a decision should have been made about who can attend the rites, require- ments for attendance and the level of privacy required for the rites. These require- ments should be used to make a decision about the locatio n. Preparation and Etiquette Preparation and Etiquette All participants should be aware of the requirements of the ritual. It is important that special requirements be honoured. Some standard preparations for any ritual should include no drugs or alcohol within 12 hours of the ritual, meditative preparation, showering and cleanliness and a state of mental preparation. All participants should be aware of ritual etiquette including what to do if they need to leave the defined ritual space. Timing Timing All participants must arrive 15-30 minutes be the rite. No late arrivals should be allowed. All participants should know what they are required to wear."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 165 Setting Setting Preparing the space is the next stage of the ritual. Participants should enter silently and be in their positions. Individual meditation should be undertaken. Incense and music should be used to set the mood. Cleansing and Containment Cleansing and Containment Traditional methods include a banishment which can be used to clear the area of any unwanted energies, there are many different rites ranging from the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Golden Dawn to simple visualisations. After this is done, a sacred space should be created to contain the energy. This can range from creating a spiritual temple to drawing a circle with the sword. It is important that this is done correctly and strong visualisations used. It is no use using elaborate incantations if the visualisations do not match in intensity. Dedication Dedication When the sacred space has been created, dedications should be offered. These can include invocations of the four elements, prayer, meditations or whatever is required. The important thing is that the space is focused on the working you are undertaking. Acceleration Acceleration Some sort of ritual activity should be used to bind the participants together and accelerate the altered state of consciousness. Chanting, dance, music, poetry - all of these can prove of valu e. Working Working This is the space when the participates are ready and the actual working is undertaken. This should be the climax of the process and should not be started until the energies are right."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 166 Integration Integration After the working is completed some time should be left for the participants to integrate what they have experienced. Final Cleansing and Containment Final Cleansing and Containment The ritual should be formally closed, a further banishing undertaken and all energies either returned to their sources or set off to carry out their appointed task. Scale Down Scale Down Time should be left for participants to relax and work down after the rite before they are sent off home. Creating a Ritual Creating a Ritual The above gives you some idea of what a ritual is made of, but how would you actually create a ritual ? Let’s take a case study. Let us say that John Smith feels he is ineffectual, he is unable to be firm with those around him, and lacks drive and ambition. He decides he wants to confront this fear and give himself some direction, he decides therefore to perform a ritual focused on Geburah in Yetzirah. He has chosen Geburah as it represents Mars - the force of action and has chosen Yetzirah as it represents the world of the unconscious. He starts to collect background information on Mars. He started by examining basic books of Kabbalistic lore. Some of these include 777 and other Qabalistic writings of Aleister Crowley (Samuel Weiser, various editions), Sepher Sephiroth, Godwin’s Cabalistic Encyclopaedia (Llewellyn) and the Magicians Companion, Bill Whit- comb (Llewellyn 1993). He finds the following correspondences of interest. Geburah is attributed to Mars. It is related to the four Fives in the Tarot - Wands, Cups, Swords and Discs. The Yetzirah card is Five of Swords. It is connected to four other centres on the Tree of Life:"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 167 Binah, Tiphareth, Chesed and Hod. These are attributed to the following Tarot Trumps: Geburah- Binah: Chariot. Geburah -Chesed: Lust. Geburah - Tiphareth: Justice or Adjustment. Geburah- Hod: Hanged Man. Geburah is also related to the following correspondences. Egyptian God: Horus and Nepthys Colours: (Emperor Scale of Colour) Bright Scarlet. Greek: Thor, Aries and Hades. Stone: Ruby Plants: Nettle, Oak. Perfume: Tobacco. Believe it or not, here he has all the information required to create his ritual. On the Altar will be the Five of Swords, the major working will be to travel through this card and come back with a sense of power. He will place the Tarot Trumps of the related four centres in each Elemental corner. He will wear a black robe with a bright scarlet overlay. He will burn tobacco and perhaps some nettle as his incense. He will play martial music (Mars from Holst’s Planets is effective) and use red throughout the Temple scheme. He will research and find some prayers and invocations to Mars in the various mythologies. After his primary working he will re-orient himself to each quarter and visualise each Tarot trump as related to inner strength. The Chariot as self control, Lust as strength, Justice as honour and the Hanged man as finding the strength and power within him."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 168 There are the rudimentaries of his rite, he will chose a banishing and Elemental invocation, perhaps with martial overtones and chose a location where he will not be disturbed and somewhere he can be as loud and strong as he likes without the neighbours complaining !! Conclusions Conclusions Ritual and Ceremony forms an integral part of Gnostic practise. It is not an easy thing to get used to. It is, in some sense, irrational - and that is why it works. It silences the mind, and allows us to explore the realms both within and beyond the psyche. There is a certain art to ritual and first attempts may seem clumsy. However, sincerity and meaning are far more important than polish. We have seen technically perfect rituals with absolutely no power ! The best way to start working with ritual is to explore the Kabbalah and related correspondences, and start creating rituals of your own. By far the best rituals are those made by you for you. X"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 169 Thoughts have power ! They are a form of energy which can effect ourselves and the world around us. It is difficult to consider thoughts as “things”; we tend to think of them as images that fly across our minds eye, rather than as real objects. In everyday life we are taught to believe that what we think has no substance - only action counts. However, if you replay a recent event on your mental screen, you can start to consider the power of thought. Your memories, which are composed of thought, seems very real. You can explore the senses of the memory and, if you are not careful, fall into it and lose track of time. (daydreams are a good example of this). These memories seem to be more than just flickering images - they have related senses - smell, touch, taste and sound. There have been many psychic investigations of the nature of thought ranging from the charismatic Charles Leadbeater to Kirlian photography. While interpretations may vary, all agree that thoughts have power and form, and have far more influence than we credit. The Characteristics of Thoughts The Characteristics of Thoughts Thoughts exist on multiple planes. They are emanated from the mental plane, and then take form on the astral worlds. Since many thoughts involve emotions, various levels of existence are moulded together to create the “form” of a given thought. Thoughts exist primarily in two ways; as a vibration, and as a form. The thought itself exists as a vibration or resonance in the mental body. If the thought was a simple, pure conceptualisation, then it would only exist in this form. However, most thoughts are mixtures of varying vibrations, and hence, exist on multiple planes between the physical and the mental. As the thought reaches the astral realms it triggers an associated emotional response and this combination of vibration and response creates the form. A trained clairvoyant would experience the vibration as a wave in the mental plane, but see the form of the thought as a three dimensional reality in the astral. The best way to understand these forms is to appreciate their nature."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 170 Thought forms Thought forms When a thought form is created on the astral it can take many different shapes and structures. There are normally three classifications of these forms: Å Forms which reflect the maker. Ç Forms which reflect an object. É Forms which have their own inner form. The first form is found when we think about themselves. They have both a positive and negative influence. If we constantly think of ourselves in a way different to how we are, we create a tension between the created form and our reality. This can be useful if a change is needed, but disastrous if we are not prepared for the result. (An example here is why an Anorexic always sees him/herself as fat. The thought form is fat, the reality is not, and a tension is created). The second form includes a myriad different characteristics. Thoughtforms is this class can be images of any physical reality or even of mechanical and fantasy design. For example, you may create a thought form with hundreds of arms and legs, or as a unicorn or giant. Any shape than can be thought can be summoned into a form. The third form is when a thought has taken a natural shape, because it has not been have given a form. These forms can range from swirling masses to shapes and spirals of immense beauty or darkness. Many examples of this form can be found in Thoughtforms by Besant and Leadbeater (Theosophical Publishing House 1971). Each of these forms has one thing in common, they are made of colour. Depending on the nature of the form, various colours will manifest. This is the one sure way to appreciate the real nature of a form, while colours can be manipulated by thought, the real vibratory nature of the thought (the real colour) will make itself known in some way. The general principles which are the basis for the production of Thoughtforms are:"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 171 Å The quality of the thought determines colour. Ç The nature of the thought determines its form. (Except in artificially created Thoughtforms). É The strength of the thought determines the clarity of the form. Some considerations on the Nature of Some considerations on the Nature of Thought Thought Thoughts (like any energy form) have a tendency towards entropy, they degrade over a period of time. It is necessary, therefore, when working with Thoughtforms to take this into account. For example, some schools divide Thoughtforms into three classes, each related to the time-frame they are programmed to operate in.. Sustained Thoughtforms. Sustained Thoughtforms. These are usually designed for protective purposes. The best example is a personal or property Watcher. They need to be recharged at regular intervals. Periodic Thoughtforms Periodic Thoughtforms These are special Thoughtforms which are programmed to only exist for a pre- destined time period. A classic example here would be the Thoughtforms which exist at any given religious festival or feast. Solo Thoughtforms Solo Thoughtforms These exist to achieve one action only. They are programmed to achieve a certain task or do a certain job. There are some amazing examples of the above classifications. For example, it is thought that the Ancient Egyptians used a sustained thoughform which took it’s energy from the forces around it in the tomb and sand and thus it could exist for an immense time period without degradation. Another interesting consideration, is at what stage a thought becomes an Eggregore. It has to be realised that all out thoughts are not our own. Memes, as special types"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 172 of thought, can travel from mind to mind and make themselves feel at home. They seem like our own thoughts, but are not. This occurs because certain concepts and thoughts have either achieved one or two forms. 1. 1. Take on a life of their own Take on a life of their own This occurs because there are so many people thinking on a similar concept that the thoughts coalesce and develop a discrete form of their own, separate from those thinking them. This form then feedbacks and influences the individuals who think about it, or thoughts related to it. 2. 2. Principalities and Dominions Principalities and Dominions This is where the Eggregore or discrete thought has become a vehicle for a lower astral force. This occurs often and is the way in which the Demiurge can influence human consciousness. Eggregores are accordingly, group thoughts, which have taken on a discrete identity. Some are Demiurgic, others are simply semi-autonomous. Semi au- tonomous Eggregores self destruct if people stop concentrating about a given idea, over a period of time the energy degrades, and the idea or thought is forgotten. Demiurgic or Archonic Eggregores are sustained by the fallen field and can continue forever. By the way, if you doubt the power of a group thought look at what occurs in a political rally or even a football riot. How to Create and Program a Thoughtform How to Create and Program a Thoughtform A successful Thoughtform is one which has been given existence on the mental and astral planes by clear, precise creation and programming. It may also require a great deal of sustainment, depending on your time-frame programming. Å Start with a clear idea of what Thoughtform you wish to create, and what it should achieve. Write down your idea, contemplate it, and make it precise. Once this idea has been decided on, do not change it. Unless you have what you require clear in mind, it will not work or worse, will work against you."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 173 Ç Visualise what you want clearly, mentally design the form you want your Thoughtform to take. Clearly see its image in the minds eye, sense it, smell it and touch it if you can. Make it as real as possible. É Using slow and deep breathing sense psychic energy building up in your astral body, sustain the image of the Thoughtform clearly in your mind. Repeat out loud what you want the Thoughtform to achieve. Ñ At this stage you may wish to use some energy raising technique of your own. You may use dance, music- anything technique you like to develop a reserve of energy. Ö Hold your hands together, and visualise the energy you have accumulated as current between your palms. Visualise your Thoughtform appearing in this energy field and watch it take form. Ü Visualise the Thoughtform setting (like mould), made out of your psychic energy. Again repeat reasons for which the Thoughtform has been created. Outline the period it has been programmed for and any other relevant instructions. á “See” the Thoughtform leave, and set about the necessary processes to complete the task. Come back to everyday consciousness and perform your normal daily activities. Do not dwell on your working, let the Thoughtform do its work. M Remember to schedule in re-chargings (much like the above) at regular intervals if required. Some Practical advice. Some Practical advice. Remember to start with simple Thoughtforms, don’t be overambitious. Combine Thoughtform creation with ritual techniques for better results.

Well, yes. But lets not lose our heads about it. The first and foremost thing to learn about evil is that it generally exists only in your own alarmed imagination. Don’t be afraid of Black Magick. Robert Anton Wilson in Gnostica Feb-March 1977. The above quote is a great place to start when talking about psychic self defence. Too many people today are just plain paranoid and this is not, I repeat, not the state to start contemplating psychic self defence from. It is all too easy to stand in the position of being so self righteous, that we attribute psychic attack to all those who disagree with us. This in itself can be a form of psychic attack, it is known as a “Belief Attack,” and occurs when we project so much paranoia and fear, that it returns to haunt us. The more we fight it, the stronger it gets. It is important to be objective before you start attributing certain experiences to psychic attack. The first stage of critical examination should involve examining your own mental and emotional state, and that of those around you. If, after some thought, you still feel something is wrong then, and only then, should you begin to consider"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 176 that you might be under psychic attack. With these clarifications in mind, it is true that psychic attack is more prevalent than we think. Traditional primitive systems of magic believed all diseases were a form of psychic attack. Now while we may not accept this today, certainly disease of sudden and unexpected manifestation, uncontrollable headaches, nightmares, loss of “luck” and other maladies may have a psychic origin. These things, in themselves, do not mean you are under attack, however, in combination, and in the right situation, they are perhaps indicative. The Law of Association The Law of Association The simplest explanation for how psychic attacks work is found in what is known as the law of association. The most erudite definition of this is found in Real Magic by Bonewits, where he states that “ if any two or more patterns have elements in common, these patterns interact through these elements, and control of one pattern facilities control over the other(s), depending, among other facts, on the number of common elements involved”. In more simple terms, if two or more people are in contact (or have been in contact) an “astral link” exists between them. This link may be used by either party to influence the other. It is also possible to create an astral link through the use of objects which have, in the past, been in contact with the other party - some common examples would include hair, nails and clothing. The Law of Association gives us a basic idea of how a psychic attack may be ac- complished, however, things are never as simple as they seem. There are four dis- tinct forms of psychic attack. Psychic Static Psychic Static This form of attack could probably be better understood as unconscious thought projection. It usually originates from someone you have known for quite a while, and is more intense when this person is under stress. Many cases of poltergeist ac- tivity can be attributed to psychic static, and can be traced to a teenager with emo- tional problems. In cases of Psychic Static, the originator usually has no knowledge of what is happening, the force is being projected unconsciously along the primary astral threads or links the unknowing perpetrator possesses. This form of attack most commonly causes headaches and minor mental disturbances, while in ex- treme cases poltergeist activity and sympathetic emotional reactions (including pain) have been noted."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 177 Psychic Draining Psychic Draining This sort of psychic attack happens when you open to too many people. The result of such unreserved openness is a feeling of exhaustion and loss of energy. This form of psychic attack occurs regularly, far more than we care to admit. There are more emotional and psychic “vampires” than we ever realise. These are profes- sional victims, those who demand our constant emotional attention and assistance. Certainly, there are also deliberate psychic vampires (Gurus and cult leaders are good examples) but these are few and far between. Far more prevalent is the pro- fessional victim, who whines for assistance, affection and help, thus draining you of every ounce of energy you have. Psychic Attack Psychic Attack Full frontal psychic attack is very unusual, but does occur. It is usually by someone you know or have at least, had some contact with. Psychic attack by someone un- known to you is unusual, but possible (as long as they have something which con- nects you to them). Full frontal psychic attack can range from the simple nuisance attack, to curses - which can bring about disease and death. Psychic Atmospheres Psychic Atmospheres Psychic atmospheres come in two forms. The first is the classic haunted house or location. When you enter these locations or environments you are linked to them. Usually this attack is impersonal, that is to say, you have no personal connection to the situation, but this is not always the case. While this category borders on haunt- ing and is not always considered a psychic attack, if you are living in a haunted house and find it is becoming a nuisance then this may be the explanation. The second is what can be best described as Systematic Attack, to fully appreciate this we need to consider it in some detail. Living in a World Possessed ! Living in a World Possessed ! I have deliberately chosen an extravagant paragraph heading, as it is important to consider how alien the Gnostic really is to the fallen world.

When Jesus said you should expect persecution, he was not joking ! When you start to be reborn, your energy is like a beacon, a flashing light warning the fallen system, the Archons, Memes, demons and fallen angels to take a special interest. I am not suggesting you should always be looking over your shoulder, paranoia does not help in spiritual transformation, however, you must be aware that you are now a stranger in a war torn land and the earth is no longer your home. There are many skills you need to develop to deal with this, some as outlined below, are psychic and occult in nature, others are more psychological. Both have their place. Since the physical world is a fallen kingdom, the Demiurge has dominion over it. In the New Testament when St.Paul says “Satan is the God of this world”, he is speaking literally. It is therefore of no use to expect justice, equality and perfection in our daily lives. While we must fight against injustice and hatred there is a limit - the baseline must be, does it interfere with my spiritual life ? It is of no value spending your whole life fighting “city hall”, and losing your soul. Within the fallen world there are many “little tyrants”, meaningless individuals who believe that by climbing to the top of their little dunghill they have made it. They will fight to the death to get to the top, and then fight to the death to stay there. It is self defeating for the Gnostic to constantly do battle with these “Gods in their own mind” type people. You could spend every day of your life fighting with them and still there would be more. It is important for the Gnostic to be brutally realistic with themselves. Too often we fight against some injustice not because it is really that unjust, but because our ego hurts. The bottom line is that we do not wish to lose face. In many cases the actual loss incurred by simply ignoring a petty tyrant is far less than the time and effort that would be lost in the battle that would result if you challenged them. There is a difficulty here, we must then control the ego, we must be prepared to backdown, to lose face in the eyes of the world. This is a most difficult thing. There is a time for battle and bloodshed and a time for retreat. There is a time to “go quietly on the earth”, and another to “rage against the night”. The Gnostic must be able to decide what strategy to use in which situation. It is no value"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 179 spending your life fighting against the world - judgement has already been passed, the earth is dead. Your task is to transform, to be Transfigured - not to try and save everybody else. As part of this strategy the Gnostic needs to learn to keep his own counsel, to keep separate from the world. Avoid meaningless acquaintances and friends, cultivate only those who share, (or at the very least) have a strong sympathy in your belief system. The less “psychic links” you have, the less you are open for them to be abused. Be cunning - use your mind as well as your psychic skills. Techniques of Psychic Self Defence Techniques of Psychic Self Defence Cutting the Cord Cutting the Cord There are many simple techniques for dealing with unwanted connections or links, both ritual and psychic. A very simple technique uses a chair (or a partner) and some string or cord. You enter a meditative state and visualise the person with whom you have an astral link sitting in the chair in front of you, a cord or piece of string can be run from yourself to the chair (or partner). Spend some time contemplating the nature of the link you have with this person, consider the emotions involved, go over times when you meet them, try and make the link as real as possible. If you are working with a ritual partner get them to “role play” the other person - make the experiences as real as possible. If you wish to combine technology with the experience, use photographs, videos or tape recordings of the person. After a period of time you should begin to sense the link, as you sense the link becoming stronger, focus the link on the cord. (The cord should be tied firmly to the chair or held firm by your partner). Sense all your connection entering to the cord. After you feel your whole relationship in this cord, use a ritual dagger (or a pair of scissors if you prefer) to cut the cord. As the cord is cut state firmly that the con- nection to this person is severed. Visualise the psychic connection, that glistening white line of light, being severed between you and them forever. A variation of this technique is to visualise the cord and see it as representing all unwanted connections, name it “acquaintances and business partners”, “distant family members” and disconnect accordingly."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 180 The Dome The Dome This is a simple visualisation technique which can be used to create a protective psychic environment. Imagine a dome, a bit like an inverted test-tube. It should surround what you need to protect - yourself, your home, whatever. Try and experience what the dome you have visualised is like, notice its colour, textures, smell - everything you can. Interact with the dome - using your imagination tell it what you want it to be. It should be weightless and unintrusive. It should repel forces which are not sympathetic to your environment, but otherwise not have any other task. If it is surrounding you, notice it moving when you move. Make sure you (and the Dome) are clear about what has to be accomplished. If you feel you are under regular psychic attack, then visualise the outside of the Dome as a reflective, shiny surface, bouncing back any destructive forces. Remember to check the Dome often and recharge it ! The Bell The Bell Visualise a bell between your hands. See it clearly and make yourself aware of all the senses connected to it. Move the image to your Solar Plexus and sense it extending a field of energy to all parts of your Astral body. Programme it to ring if you are psychically attacked, and react with a shield of light. If a psychic attack should occur, you should hear the sound of bell and a shield of light will surround you. Another variation to use is to visualise a laser which shoots down energies which are unsympathetic to your development. The adaptations are endless.. Familiars Familiars A rather fun technique is to create your own Elementals. The way to do this is to visualise the four elements and attribute to each of them a small creature. You may use a Salamander for fire, a frog for water, a bird for air and a mouse for earth It is totally up to you. You can even manifest creatures from fantasy or mythology. You can even name them. You can, and indeed should, spend regular sessions visualis- ing each creature, giving them power and programming them to respond in unique"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 181 ways to psychic attacks. You can create a division of labour, whereby each creature responds to different types of attacks in their own way. This is a very personal process, which is open to your own ingenuity. This is a useful method, as the Gnostic will spend much time (and hence energy) bringing these creatures to life and hence they are highly effective. You can supplement this method by drawing your creatures, making models and seeing them as some of your household pets. This was the basis of the charge that Witches kept Familiars, strange animals which protected their lives and property. In these days it pays to have a few familiars numbered among your family pets ! X"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 182 The Yugas The Yugas History is a record of degeneration. Since the earliest times man has been sinking deeper and deeper into the mire of matter. This view is not popular with the materialists and exoteric priests of our culture, but is nevertheless a core esoteric truth. In his work “The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times”, Rene Guenon succinctly outlines the process of spiritual degeneration. As man thinks he is evolving, he is simply accelerating his own destruction - living standards and technology may advance, but only at the cost of spirit. This metaphysical entropy causes matter to become successively more physical, more solid, and on a spiritual level - more malefic. Society becomes centred on collectives (witness the New World Order), rather than on nations and individuals and there is an emphasis on scientific advances rather than simplicity. As we reach the later phases of this degeneration (the present period), anti-traditions and forms of anti-gnosis arise purporting to be of spiritual value. The most dangerous facet of this process is how, in the darkest age, fissures will appear in the barrier between the physical world and the lower astral planes, and there will be an intrusion of the malefic inhabitants of this inferior subtle domain. This process of degeneration is codified in the early Vedic system by dividing history into four ages or Yugas. The Sanskrit names for the four ages are Krita or Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga. These can also be correlated to the Greek historical tradition as the ages of Gold, Silver, Bronze and Iron. The Krita Yuga is the Golden Age, the age of Spirit and from there things get successively worse until the Kali age, which ends in an apocalypse of water and fire. Each age in succession is shorter than it predecessor, is more intense, and more material. The Kali age is the shortest, most materialist and intensely destructive. It is this age we are in now...."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 183 The Cycle of the Yugas The Cycle of the Yugas The cycle of the Yugas within the Vedic canon of India are important, for they show the overall state of the earth itself (with all related Lifestreams). Hence, the Yugas cover millions and millions of years, and document the cycle of Earth's history itself. While in other books we will study the history of man prior to coming to earth (and this later study is a fascinating one), this is way beyond the scope of this volume. However, just to give you a taste, it is possible that man's stay on earth is only one part of a much greater cycle. In this scheme of things, man had evolved through three cosmic cycles before migrating to the earth sphere and the resulting fall. In the works of Rudolf Steiner, these cycles were known as Saturn, Sun and Earth-Moon, and were related to major changes within the Solar System. These cycles were interrupted by the Cosmic Battle, which caused the earth sphere to fall out of the Static Plane and enter into a fallen, physical existence. While a descent into the lower forms of the astral was part of the normal evolutionary scheme - matter was not. The path of Transfiguration returns man to the cosmic cycle, and carries him back to the Static Kingdom of Light. However, it is not the end of man’s development, by no means. In this grandiose plan, man would still have three further cycles to work through (there being seven Great cycles with seven lesser cycles in each). This is perhaps only one phase of an even greater scheme. However, enough esoteric speculation ! The cycles of the Yugas as they apply to the ages of earth (exoteric and esoteric) are important, for they show the state of the earth and its various Lifestreams. The Yugas show man’s degeneration, since they are from the viewpoint of all of humanity. The four Yugas show the fall from the Golden Age, through to the most destructive age; that of Iron - this is also known as the Kali Yuga or Age of the Wolf. The Great year The Great year At the same time as the Yugas are unfolding and man heads for destruction, the Treasury of light is working to offer man the Gnosis. A good analogy here would be someone drowning at the sea-side, as he is sinking deeper and deeper into the water, inching closer and closer to death, the lifeguard is struggling harder and harder to save him. As the Yugas unfold and exoteric (popular) religion and philosophy degenerates, more and more the Gnosis is revealed to those who seek"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 184 the path. It is a strange and terrible contradiction that today there is more Gnosis than ever before, and less people than ever wanting it. The Great Year is a cycle of approximately 26,000 years, it is also know as the precession of the equinoxes. Because the earth wobbles on its axis it moves backwards through the signs of the zodiac, a full cycle takes around 26,000 year. In each sign energy is radiated into earth consciousness, this radiation is mixed and includes light and darkness, X and Y factors. In the modern Gnostic view these energy forms radiate from the “Throne of Ra” which is positioned in the centre of our system. This seat exists within the Solar Logos, and these energies emanates from within it. Accordingly, the four forces which radiate the planet from this centre are influenced by the astrological age that the earth is in. Even the fallen or Archonic forces are influenced by it, though they manifest a destructive distortion of its formula. For the Gnostic to develop, he must master the formulae of each age (either historically via reincarnation, or within a lifetime using various spiritual means). Each period radiates an influence within the historical continuum, and brings man to consider his development. Whether this consideration is positive or negative depends on the evolution of the individual and the world as a whole. Each of the ages has a specific formula, and a means of spiritual illumination. For example, the age of Pisces can be correlated with the imagery of Horus and is the time which focuses on reconciliation of man with the Light worlds. However, just as powerful as the formula of Light, is the misuse of the Aeonic force by the Archons to create an unbalanced current. For example, in this same period, the apostate Christian churches (under the direction of Emperor Constantine) re-edited the Bible and created a political force which has decayed western civilisation ever since. We can correlate the astrological ages with events within history quite easily. We can link the age of Aries with the early sacrificial religions, the Age of Pisces with that of the revelation of Jesus (the imagery of the fish is certainly suggestive) and we can then see the incoming current as that of Maat or Aquarius. It is interesting to backdate the the aging of the Sphinx and note that the current age suggested of 10,500 BCE links well with the astrological change that was taking place at that"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 185 time, the movement from Virgo to Leo. Is the Sphinx a mixture of feminine and lion characteristics ? This is an intriguing and challenging possibility. Heraldic Cycles Heraldic Cycles Every astrological age lasts around 2150 years, these ages can again be sub-divided into 12 minor periods. The last minor period before the dawning of the next age is known as the Equinox of the Gods or the Heraldic period. It was during this period that the priests of old prepared for the great change, modifying God-forms, ritual formulae and temple procedures to fulfil the characteristics of the new incoming sign. This preparatory period is 180 years in length and can be divided into 4 nexus dates and three periods of sixty years each. The present Heraldic Cycle, Equinox of the Gods or Remnant Age represents the expansion and development of the Mysteries, and a final opportunity for transfor- mation and return to the kingdom of light. Further Gnosis is revealed and perfected, and the message of the Gnosis is heralded as we head into Aquarius and the nexus of the Kali Yuga. The start of this age is usually dated between 1844 and 1910, we believe 1844 to be the accurate starting point. This is a complex period which, nearing the end of the cycle, involves massive conflicts between the powers of Light and Darkness. It is also the period when the apostate (false) faiths of Judaism and Christianity (and other Counter Gnostic traditions) have taken hold of the culture at large and the Gnostic message only survive underground. The remnant period has nexus dates at 1844, 1904, 1964 and 2004.

The Exegesis of the Soul. Nag Hammadi Library II 134:6-15 . Aquarius Aquarius The climax of this Heraldic period is the dawning of Aquarius between 2000 and 2100. Aquarius is not love and light, its ruler is Saturn which is attributed to Binah on the Tree of Life. Traditional cosmology divided Saturn into two poles, one above the abyss and the other operating below. The lower Binah relates to Satan and the Demiurge and represents the destruction of the earth cycle. The higher Binah represents Saturn as the tester or purifier who refines the Gnostic until he is capable of passing through the abyss into the Pleroma. In any event, mankind will be dragged kicking and screaming into confrontation with his darkest fears. Return to the Yuga of Gold: Return to the Yuga of Gold: Rectification and Regeneration Rectification and Regeneration The climax of the Age of Aquarius will be the Millennium, the time of rectification and regeneration. It is the dawning of Maat or Truth. It is the time when the cycle is completed and regeneration occurs. In lesser cycles it is a time of renewal, in the great cycle it is the final Omega Point, when the system is rectified and the fallen Dialectic system ceases to be.

Yugas and Ages Yugas and Ages If we correlate the astrological ages and the Yugas we can see that while man may have physically developed, he has in reality, lost more and more of his spiritual side. The exoteric forms of religion, philosophy and thinking have evolved, but they have been isolated from the Gnosis by man’s addiction to matter. As the Yugas unfold and society advances technologically, and complexities increase, the esoteric faith is forgotten. At the same time, the Gnosis has been refined by generations of secret sects, cults and Ecclesias, working underground to offer man a chance to return home. The ages represent the radiations of Solar force which are working to liberate man, each age changes the nature of the X and Y factors which can be received and utilised.

If we wish to consider the earliest recorded forms of religion, then we need to consider the finds of archaeology. In the many digs which have occurred around the globe, the oldest finds have been of fertility figures with exaggerated sexual organs and images which give evidence of early forms of star watching and astronomy. Since these earliest discoveries all seem to fall cleanly into one of two classes, then it is tempting to evaluate them in the light of the Gnostic tradition. It is likely that the fertility symbols represented the worship of earth, the desire to reproduce, the submission of mankind to the physical, while the watching of the stars (the Sky cult) illustrates the early development of the Gnostic desire to go beyond. This contradiction is important for it shows that even during the earliest periods, there was a dividing line - a duality between those of the sky cult who knew, and those of the earth cult who were in ignorance. For the Gnostic the earth cults and the worship of fertility represents the loss of individual immortality with the life or essence returning to the spirit of the family, the totems and ancestors with the result that all realisation is lost (at least for that life time). The sky cult with its secret calculations, esoteric astrology and megalithic structures represented the knowledge of the Light Worlds, a desire to return to whence we came and a rejection of the values of the fallen earth. These two contradictory forces can be seen throughout the history of the Gnosis. In many Gnostic schools there was a certain hierarchy, even a caste structure which included both of these traditions. While on an esoteric level the Sky cult had transcendence as the focus, on an exoteric level, the earth cult and related reproductive characteristics was cultivated, if not encouraged. The “double doc- trine” of Plato is a superb example of how this hierarchy of truth could exist, while the esoteric tradition worked in isolation, the exoteric tradition was sustained for the sake of the community, even, at times, denying that the esoteric tradition existed"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 190 except to those who were properly prepared. In some sense this is out of a sense of pragmatism, while reproduction sustains the fallen system, it at least, fulfils the task of giving bodies for souls to incarnate into and hence gain the possibility of Transfiguration. In the Gnostic Apostolic Tradition these two cults are reconciled in the Paths of the Dove and of the Serpent. Historically speaking, there are many examples of these cults as opposing traditions, as reconciled in esoteric brother- hoods, or as corrupted by the Demiurgic forces. It should be clearly stated that the earth cult can only be of value in connection with that of the Sky, pagan movements (ancient and modern) which worship the earth are simply sustaining the dominion of the Demiurge. As we head towards the Omega day the value of the earth cult becomes less, anti-traditions and false earth cults take precedence, and reproduction and family becomes less and less justifiable. At the same time the need for transcendence becomes paramount. Egypt Egypt We are sorely in need of a truth or self understanding similar to that of Ancient Egypt. Carl Jung. It is difficult to “put a pin on the map” for where the modern cycle of Gnosis began. We could theoretically go back to Atlantis, Mu and beyond, but then we are voyaging into meta-history and speculation. It is generally accepted that Egypt was the point of origin, at least in the modern cycle. There has been much pioneering work done to show that Egypt was not some Middle eastern backwater, but was a thriving cosmopolitan empire which had satellites around the world. It formed the nucleus in which much of the esoteric tradition developed. While much of the form of modern Kabbalah originated in Medieval Mysticism, Alchemy and Hermeticism, we can clearly see that the basic mythology and forms was Egyptian in origin. The recorded history of Egypt covers an immense period of time. Even the earliest forms of Egyptian civilisation - which concentrated on the stellar worship of the Star Goddess had a highly evolved structure and form. By the first Dynasty a wide range of esoteric and religious cults could be found, and a complex system of burial was evolved to guide the deceased into the Treasury of Light, bypassing the fallen"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 191 worlds. These ceremonies later evolved to include complex mummification pro- cesses and were chronicled in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. It is also believed that this text (and others) used secret codes to outline the Mysteries as taught within the Egyptian occult schools. These teachings were complex and sophisticated. For example, it was taught that man was seen as having ten bodies, ranging from the Khu or Self to the Ka or astral body. It is intriguing that these fit so well with the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, however, when we consider that Moses was an Egyptian initiate, the link becomes self evident. The life of the average man or women in Egypt was saturated with magic, there was no artificial separation between religion and magic. While there certainly was an esoteric craft sustained by a specialised priest class, there was always festivals, feasts and celebrations that catered to the needs of the masses. Medicine was closely associated with Astrology and Herbalism and early forms of metallurgy were taught as part of the arcanum of Alchemy. Every facet of Egyptian life was in some way connected to the Mysteries. The Pyramids and the Sphinx are two of the great mysteries of Egypt, they have been interpreted as being everything from storage bins for grain to Initiatory temples. The esoteric tradition holds that they were build by the survivors of Atlantis and that even their geometry embodies the ancient ways. From these speculations a whole system has developed (Pyramidology) which attempts to interpret the meaning of the shapes, angles and numbers of the great pyramids. From the perspective of the esoteric tradition the greatest legacy that Egypt has left us is not found in stone, but is found in the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus. The Teachings of Hermes The Teachings of Hermes Hermeticism takes its name from the person of Hermes Trismegistus. He was believed to be the greatest scholar of Ancient Egypt and while he is reputed to have written many texts, only a small number survive. One of the most important surviving texts is that of the Poemandres. The basic principle of Hermeticism is that our supreme goal must be to become part of God, to achieve this goal we must escape from the cycles of birth, death and rebirth as perpetuated by the Demiurge and as represented by the planets. There is some debate over exactly how Hermeticism sees the world, some commentators see Hermeticism as accepting"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 192 matter (and perhaps even the Demiurge) as part of the natural scheme of things, while others offer a more traditional dualistic interpretation. Due to the limits on available primary texts perhaps we will never be truly sure. The emphasis on the Logos or Divine Word as the Son of God relates the Hermetic tradition to later Christian Gnosticism, indeed many early Church Fathers used Hermeticism as part of their apologetics. Israel Israel Where did the people of Israel originate ? It seems that this is a quirk of history which will not be easily solved. From Biblical accounts we know that Moses came from Sumer and that Abraham was a Chaldean, so the assumption can be made that the people of Israel were racially similar to the many tribes of the region (including the Sumerians and Egyptians). There is also a suggestion that they were part and parcel of Egyptian society, however, as Egypt became more cosmopolitan and came to loose its spiritual values, the Israelites slowly developed as a distinct religious community. As time progressed and Egypt moved towards multiculturalism and religious syncretism, the religious separatism and character of the Israelites become a point of contention and they were persecuted. After many confrontations the Isrealites escaped into the deserts and developed a unique identity, indeed, the name Egypt became synonymous with the fallen world. Israel evolved, at first, into a theocratic state firmly entrenched in the Mysteries, however, as happens with politics, compromises were made and the state of Israel distanced from the “Old Ways”. As Isreal grew tensions developed between the Stellar religion of the Mysteries and the fertility rites of surrounding tribes. These conflicts unsettled the homogenous state and brought about internal conflicts and wars. These resulted in Israel seperating into two states and further degeneration in political and social structures caused such a lack of cohesion, that Israel could be easily invaded and taken into captivity. Captivity however did not mark the end of Israel. It is an esoteric tradition that the ten lost tribes migrated to become the Anglo-Saxon Celts. Josephus writing in 70 CE states \"The Ten tribes did not return to Palestine, only two tribes serve the Romans after Palestine became a Roman province\". The two tribes who returned to"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 193 Palestine became the forerunners of the Essenes, while the ten “lost tribes” formed what we consider to be Western civilisation. According to Second Esdras, we find the ten lost tribes moving a thousand miles west to southeast Russia to become the people known as the Scythians. Those are the Ten tribes, which were carried out of their own land in the time of Osea the King, whom Salmanasar, the King of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters and so they came into another land. But they took this counsel among themselves and they would leave the multitude of the heathen and go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt, that they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land. And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow passages of the river. For still the flood till they were passed over. For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half and the same region is called Asareth. 2 Esdras 13:13-45. Ancient historians such as Ptolemy and Herodotus and modern historians such as Gibbons have also affirmed that the captive tribes of Israel were known through various periods as Guta, Getae, Gauls, Goths, Manda, Dacians, Teutons, Normans, Angli, Suka, Scythians and Saxons. All these people were of the same stock as ancient Israel - that is Aryan. Now it is possible that Israel disappeared in one section of the world and the progenitors of the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic people appeared in the same place a few years later without the two peoples being in any way related, but not hardly probable ! The overwhelming circumstantial evidence makes it appear that the lost tribes of Israel and the progenitors of the Anglo- Saxon-Celtic people were one and the same. And when, in addition to this circumstantial evidence cognisance is taken that"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 194 these people have fulfilled what the prophets wrote of Israel, the probability becomes a certainty . Sharon Turner, Anglo-Saxon Historian. The ancient traditions of Israel hence became the building blocks of the Druids, Celts and Anglo-Saxons, while the tribes of Judah who returned to Palestine, became the people we know as the Essenes. There are two major problems that arise when we discuss the people of Israel - the question of modern Jews and the nature of the Old Testament. The biggest bone of contention is the identity of modern Jewry. The answer according to the Gnostic tradition is explosive. The people of Israel were of the same racial stock as the first Dynasties of Egypt and Sumer - they were white. The modern Jews who claim the Old Testament have no racial link to Israel whatsoever, according to Arthur Koestler (author of the Thirteenth tribe) the ancestors of the modern Jews did not come from Jordan, but from the Volga, not from Canaan but from the Cauca- sus....genetically they are more related to the Hun, Uigar and Magyar tribes than to the Seed to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. (and this is from a Zionist Jewish writer !) It seems likely that the traditions of modern Jewry were evolved by the Edomite tribes while in Babylon, here gained precedence while the real people of Israel migrated to the west. The migration of Isreal created a void and substitute Israelites stepped in. Accordingly, we need to totally review our interpretation of Judaism. When we consider the great fraud that has been perpetuated, we need to run a critical eye over the Old Testament as well. When we do, we find some interesting anomalies. The Old Testament actually includes many different streams which seem to have be written by many different authors, many of which had conflicting religious views (for example, Isaiah is said to have been written by at least three different people). Accordingly, the Old Testament represents myths and legends adapted and modi- fied (even twisted) by the beliefs of the prevailing ideological elite. For example, in Babylon, records and legends of the older Qadesh Israelite priesthood were expunged and a emphasis placed on the Pharisaic priesthood . These multiple streams and authors can be discovered by reading any modern text on Biblical criticism, however, only when seen in the light of the Aryan-Israelite/Edomite"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 195 dichotomy do they take on special relevance. The Druid Connection The Druid Connection It is believed by many that the Druids were the post diaspora priestclass of Israel. Many facets of the early Druid faith resemble what we know of the Israelite Mysteries. The secret alphabet of the Israelites was used by the Druids and, for mnemonic purposes was related to trees (and later to birds and animals). Certainly the native religion of the Celts and many other Indo-Europeans betray a strong similarity to the Israelite traditions. One interesting fact to note is that according to experts in the field of linguistics Welsh has borrowed more words from Hebrew than any other language. This and many historical facts suggest that the traditions of early England rather than being darkly pagan were actually Gnostic, and embodied more truth than what was being taught in the Churches that were attacking them for heresy ! A later tradition regarding the relationship of Jesus to the Druids sheds even further light on these connections. The Essene Link The Essene Link When some of the people of Judah returned to Palestine after the captivity, not all accepted the Roman rule and integrated into the secular state. Though the Pharisees and Saducees continued the corrupt form of Talmudic (Edomite) form of Judaism, some of those who returned, kept the original Israelite-Aryan faith and separated themselves off into desert communities. Though this group travelled from location to location, around 180 BCE they formed a secret communal order to sustain the ancient Mysteries, this was located in the deserts of Palestine. This group taught separation from the people of Palestine and while many other returning Judeans mixed with the Edomites and other local peoples, this group sustained its discrete identity. They upheld the original Israelite teachings, so as \"Judaism\" in its Pharisaic form became popular they rejected it, refusing to worship in the temple and living a monastic life in the desert. This group became known as the Essenes and forms an important link in the survival of the Gnosis through the dark time from Constantine's rule to the present."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 196 If it is true as everyone attests, that Moses left an oral law, it is amongst the Essenes that it was preserved. The Pharisees who flattered themselves so highly on possessing it, only has its outward forms, as Jesus reproaches them at every moment. It is from these latter that the modern Jews descend. La Langue Hebraique, Fabre D'Olivet. It is from the ranks of the Essenes that Jesus came and re-established the Gnostic faith. Jesus was not a Jew racially, by geography (he was a Galilean) and he was certainly not a Jew by religion (Pharisaic or Edomite). He was an Israelite in the Essene sense of the world. In this context we can then see how Gnosticism (or real Christianity) developed out of the Israelite-Essenes, not the Judaism of Palestine. We can also clearly see how Judaism (in the modern sense) developed from the Talmudic schools of Babylon rather than from the traditions of Israel. Accordingly we get a clear picture that all is not what it seems in modern religious traditions. When we couple this to the fact that Emperor Constantine re-moulded the prevailing Jewish and Christian groups into a political amalgam in 325 AD (Nicea), a new perspective on history arises. They (the Essenes) were not waiting to receive the Law - they already possessed it. Their aim was to deliver it from the realms of darkness in which it had been engulfed.

The Older esoteric traditions which are seen reflected in the rites of Egypt and Israe; provided the framework by which the cultures grew and spread throughout the world, creating on its way Western Civilisation. However, still there was little opportunity for individual Salvation and Redemption. The festivals and traditions offered some experience of the divine, but a more immediate expression of the teachings was necessary. The early traditions provided a process by which the Worlds of Light revealed themselves to man, by the time of Jesus they had evolved to a point where a full restoration of the original Mystery teachings was mandatory. The various Essene and Druidic teachings had become too mixed with related national and cultural factors and hence a clear revelation of truth was required. Jesus as a pre-existent spirit - the Arch-Angel Michael, took human form so he could experience and overcome the power of the Archons and the Dialectic World, and show the way through which mankind could do likewise. He was born and lived as a human with the same potential for failing and the same temptations as all humans - he experienced the Dialectic tides and overcome them. He travelled the world in his \"so-called\" missing years, studying in both India and Britain, bringing the divergent threads of the Mystery Tradition to a common climax, while at the same time achieving a mastery of himself and the world around him. The baptism of Jesus clearly shows his high state of initiation, his energy field has been cleansed of Dialectic elements by Sophia, and in recognition of his achievement, the Father of Wisdom acknowledged his new state. Michael is now Jesus the Christ, the Christ state being the achievement of communication with the Logos. As soon as Jesus was baptised, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\" Matthew 3:16,17 Jesus was now in a position to transform the human situation, as a Son of God (a"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 198 being whose essence is in communication with the Logos and whose actions embody the Holy Spirit), he went about his task of redeeming the caged particles of light. Jesus however had more to do that simply teach the Mysteries, Jesus had to initiate the current which would open the door to deification. It was not enough to just teach, Jesus himself had to spiritually transform the nature of the Dialectic plane so that an opportunity; a gateway for redemption from the Archons could become possible. Prior to the advent of Jesus no escape from the World of the Archons was available ! Even the astral/etheric worlds were under the influence of the fallen system. Jesus therefore came to demonstrate that the death system of the Dialectic could be overcome and this is exactly what he did ! Throughout the Old Testament the Messiah is foretold in both type and in prophecy. The whole body of law, sacrifice and ceremony foreshadowed the death and resurrection of Jesus; the furniture, fabrics, structure..all aspects of the Tabernacle, hinted at what was to come and the sacrifice of the lamb was to foretell this future role. In the cosmology of the Bogomils, as the fall was caused by an immortal, Satanel, so the power of the fall could only be destroyed by an immortal - Michael. By fulfilling the prophecies and becoming a willing sacrifice Jesus became the free offering which illustrated the way in which the World of the Archons could be overcome. What Jesus offered was a new way, a new Path- the Path of Transfigu- ration. This new way leads through the mazes of the Dialectic kingdom to the Father and is the only way to immortality for Israel. Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by me.

But what does this actually mean ?"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 199 The Holy of Holies, which the veil covered was where the High Priest entered to commune with God in both the Egyptian and Israelite traditions. Now this Taberna- cle was destroyed, Jesus was both the sacrifice and the High Priest and through his voluntary death he had opened a way for individuals to achieve their own redemp- tion. But more than this ! Since Jesus was able to overcome death and the World of the Archons, individuals could now do the same. The Missing Years of Jesus The Missing Years of Jesus The Missing Years of Jesus have been a matter of scholarly contention for many years. It seems likely from available historical information that Jesus was trained by the Essenes and lived within the Essene Gnostic community. From his birth it was known that he was the Chosen One, and hence he was given special training to prepare him for that task. As part of that training he travelled to many locations around the world, learning and mastering the spiritual disciplines of the Adamic peoples, and preparing them for the esoteric traditions he was to reveal when the time was right. After these travels he returned, and acknowledged his special role by the act of Baptism under John the Baptist (a Essene recluse) and the rest, you may say, is history. The evidence for the travels of Jesus is excellent. For example, the Unknown Life or Jesus by Nicholas Notovitch offers us a first hand account of the Life of Jesus in a manuscript Notovitch found circa 1877-1878 in a monastery in Leh, the capital of Ladak. This manuscript outlines in quite some detail the life of Saint Issa (Jesus in Pali) and his travels throughout India and environs. The text is not only poetic and of some beauty, but covers many aspects of the spiritual teaching, as well as providing historical information regarding the life of Saint Issa. Considering that the early Vedic teachings derived from the Aryan Gnosis it would seem likely that Jesus would travel there to learn and teach. And the learned old men asked him this question \" it is claimed that you deny the Laws of Mossa and teach the people to desert the Temple of God. And Issa answered \" We cannot demolish what has been given by our Heavenly Father and what has been destroyed by Sinners, but I have recommended the purification"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 200 of all stain from the heart, for that is the veritable temple of God. As to the Laws of Mossa, I have striven to re-establish them in the hearts of men, and I say to you, that you are in ignorance of their true meaning. The Life of Saint Issa, Chapter 10:19-21. The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ, Nicholas Notovitch. Tree of Life Publications, USA. In regards to Jesus’ travels to Britain the details are sketchy but reliable. The evidence suggests that Israel was more of a cosmopolitan region than many scholars have realised. It had links with many peoples and many cultures. Joseph of Arimathea was a very rich man and it is now believed he bought and traded tin as well as other commodities from bases in England, probably Cornwall and Somerset. We know that after the death of Jesus around AD 63 St.Phillip actually sent Joseph and others back to England to preach the Gospel (Refer. Victory of Aurelius Ambrosius by Gildad Albanicus). There also are a abundance of legends particu- larly in Somerset about the child Jesus travelling to Britain with Joseph. It is even suggested that the very location of Glastonbury cathedral is where Jesus and Joseph built their hut on their first trip to Britain. In the western confines of Britain there is a certain royal island of large extent, surrounded by water, abounding in all the beauties of nature and necessaries of life. In it the first Neophites of Catholic Law, God beforehand acquainting them found a Church constructed by no human art but divinely constructed (by the hands of Christ himself) for the salvation of his people. The Almighty has made it manifest by many miracles and mysterious visitations that He continues to watch over it as sacred to Himself.... A letter from St.Augustine to Pope Gregory."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 201 Amazing as it may seem, even the Druids believe that Jesus came to Britain and taught them the esoteric teachings, for example, Taliesin the Bard and Druid (circa 550 CE) states \"Christ, the word from the beginning, was from the beginning our teacher and we never lost his teachings\". There are many volumes examining the details of Jesus' trek to Britain, some of the more important examine the historical record of Glastonbury which can be traced right back to the chapel built by Jesus and Joseph. For this reason the site has continued to remain sacred and became the centre of other important legends and religious tales such as those of King Arthur and his knights. Obviously since Britain was the destination for so many of the lost tribes of Israel we would expect that it would be of primary importance for the early spreading of the message. From many accounts Ireland and England were the first countries outside Palestine to receive the Christian message. The Greeks The Greeks There has been a trend in modern scholarship to overlook the role of Greek philosophy and mysticism in Gnosticism, and indeed with general reference to Christianity. It is so easy to attempt to interpret the New Testament from the perspective of Semitic social mores and forget the cosmopolitan nature of Israel at that period and the background of the Greek Mysteries. The Gospel of John illustrates this perfectly, it has a strong Hellenic orientation and uses terms that clearly come from the Greek Mystery traditions. When we consider the Gnostic Identity theory in its full context, then we can consider that the Hebrew and Greek Mysteries are simply two phases of one tradition. Indeed it is impossible to decipher many of the numerical codes of the four gospels without reference to Greek gematria, traditions and social mores. Greek philosophical works were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls and in the Nag Hammadi finds and it seems likely that the Greek Philosophers not only formed the backbone for the development of Christian doctrine (in terms of the Roman Catholic"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 202 Church), but were an integral part of the Gnostic Canon. The teachings of Plato form, in some sense, the foundation from which much of modern Gnostic thought has developed. The world of Ideals, the nature dualism, spiritual Aristocracy and other Gnostic doctrines can be all be seen in early Platonic thought, and certainly while much of Greek philosophy is at variance with the Gnostic tradition, there is much similarity also. Plotinus, Iamblichus, Apuleius, Pythagoras and others all prove of value when studying the Greek Mysteries. Indeed it is said that Iamblichus was the originator of a complete system of occult practise which was destroyed by the Christians in the sixth century. The fragments which survived gave rise to much of the Medieval system of signatures, Grimoires and planetary magic. The numerical system of Pythagoras which gave birth to geometry (and perhaps music and the arts), also was the basis for much of the Ariosophic Kabbalah, Gematria and related numerical, musical and geometrical forms. The esoteric traditions of Ancient Greek such as the Ophite and Eleutherian Mysteries are certainly considered part of the Gnostic heritage, and indeed as more becomes known of them will prove of value in our understanding of the develop- ment of early Gnostic thought. The Peratae The Peratae As the message of Jesus spread, prevailing ideological structures had to deal with what was fast becoming a spiritual revolution. Some tried to attack it head on, but this proved unsuccessful, accordingly, a process of infiltration and corruption began. As time progressed the esoteric traditions were suppressed and an official, bureaucratic Church was formed. By the time of Emperor Constantine (circa 325 AD), the esoteric traditions had gone fully underground. These underground cults went by many names, today they are generally known as Gnostics. Dating from between 140 and 400 AD, the Paerate were a important development of the Gnostic tradition. They were founded by Euphrates (born in 160 AD) and represented a strictly dualist view of the material world. They were anti-reproduction, but used sexuality as a means to stimulate para-physical energies that existed beyond the body. The Peratae were a secret cult, which operated behind closed doors and had"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 203 strict entry requirements. A central Mystery used within their teachings was that of an inner interpretation of the trek from Egypt to Jordan via Israel. According to the Peratae Israel was the soul and the trek outlined (in allegory and myth) the process of returning to the Treasury of Light. It begins with leaving Egypt (the fallen world), the soul then travels through the waters of corruption, into the deserts of asceticism, facing the attacks of the serpents (temptations and false Gnosis), until at last, the soul is purified enough that it can reach Jordan (the paradise of light, Peratos). The Peratae had a complex technology of Transfiguration including forms of meditation, tantrick practise, mantras, postures, rites and celebrations. Basilides Basilides Basilides (85 - 145 CE) claimed to be a disciple of Glaucias, the interpreter of Peter, and hence represented his teachings as having Apostolic authority. He was a copious writer, though little of his work survives today. His cosmology is akin to traditional Gnostic dualism with an emphasis on the emanations which exist between the Lord of Wisdom and the lower worlds. Basilides’ system was extremely complex involving 365 heavens with related hierarchies and forms. Jehovah was seen as a lowly creation who in turn created the physical world. When the physical world fell into disorder, the Lord of Wisdom sent his son (Christ or Nous) to liberate the fallen kingdoms from Jehovah (the creator) and the Archons. The Gnostic practise of Basilides emphasised asceticism and suffering as a path to gnosis and centred on secret rites and initiations. Valentinus was one of his pupils. Valentinus Valentinus Valentinus (110-175 CE) is in some sense the father of Gnosticism. He was an accomplished and well respected author, poet and teacher. Later in his life he travelled from his Egyptian home to teach in Rome (135-160 AD). He was close to being given a bishropic, which would have certainly changed the face of the Church, alas this did not occur and he seceded from the Church. Valentinus taught what he claimed were the secret teachings of St.Paul, these included a complex cosmology based on dualism and emanations. His teachings mixed Greek philoso-"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 204 phy, mysticism and magic with an allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament, they are probably the most intellectual of all the Gnostic traditions. Mysticism, Tantra and esoteric practise were part of the Valentianian system and this led to claims of sexual excess against his followers by many Church Fathers. The same Fathers, however, admit that Valentinus lead a faultless life and that his erudition and education was superior to many of the supposed Church academics. His Secret Gospel of Truth is considered one of the major surviving Gnostic texts. The Paulicians The Paulicians There is only one thing that separates us from the Romans (Catholics). We say that there is a go who is a heavenly father and has no power in this world, but in the world to come and that there is another god, the Creator, who has power over the present world; whereas the Romans recognise the existence of one sole god, who is both heavenly father and creator of the world. Historia, Peter of Sicily. The major emphasis in the teachings of the Paulicians was extreme dualism. They believed that the creator of this world is evil and that matter is a prison. The heavenly Father is way beyond the present scheme of things and exists separately in a dimension of perfection, he can only be experienced through knowledge or Gnosis. The Paulicians totally rejected the Old testament identifying its God with the Demiurge, they saw Jesus as the emissary of the light world and the only chance of experiencing the divine. Their response to the world was unique in the Gnostic world, they were militaristic in emphasis and battled, both intellectually and physically, against the prevailing ecclesiastical authorities. It is rumoured that some of the descendants of the Paulicians joined the Knight Templars. The major period of Paulician teaching was between 600 and 1100 CE."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 205 The Bogomils The Bogomils The Bogomils started in Bulgaria around 950 CE. They take their name from their founder, the priest we know only as Bogomil. His name meant friend or beloved of God. The Bogomils were extreme dualists, railing against the world and reproduc- tion. They encouraged homosexuality as an alternative to family life and this is how the term bogar or bugger came into the slang vocabulary of the world. They taught that not only matter, but the Church and all earthly institutions were of the Demiurge and encouraged a pacifistic and simple life in response. As a result they were hunted down and killed without mercy. The Cathars The Cathars The name Cathars comes from the Greek word Katharos, which literally means the purified , it is more regularly translated as “the pure ones”. It is the title given to a range of movements which existed between the third and eleventh centuries in Armenia, Assyria, Asia Minor, the Balkans and Europe. Within western Europe these early Gnostics appeared in northern France and the Low Countries toward the late 11th or early 12th century. Persecuted and expelled from the north, they travelled south and found success in the semi-independent province of Languedoc and the surrounding regions. Here they became known as Albigenses. At their height it was said that there were some 50,000 Cathars and 3,000 Parfait. The Roman Catholic Church initially attempted to bring them back to the fold through subtle means. However, when every attempt failed, Pope Innocent III launched the Albigensian Crusade (circa 1209-29) that annihilated the Cathars and desolated much of southern France. Small groups are believed to have survived in isolated areas, but were continually pursued by the Inquisition. While beliefs varied from movement to movement (there were some 50 distinct Cathar sects), they generally held certain Gnostic doctrines in common. These included strict dualism and a belief that the material world was the creation of Satan, this false creator they called Rex Mundi or the King of the World. They rejected all of the Old Testament and opposed the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 206 Church as well as its liturgy and sacraments. The central rite of the Cathar faith was the Consolamentum, a special baptism which initiated those who have moved from being Credentes (believers) to Parfait (Perfect Ones). This rite was preceded by fasting and was considered such an important initiation that to break the oath of the Parfait meant expulsion from the Cathar community. It is generally believed that most Cathars were vegetarian and avoided reproduction. Historically there is much evidence for contact and communication between the Cathars and Bogomils. It is said that a Bogomil bishop arranged discussions and meetings with Cathar bishops in many regions. Brethren of the Free Spirit Brethren of the Free Spirit The first Gnostic to be known under the appellation of “Free Spirit” was Amalric of Bena (circa 1209), an Italian Antinomian who believed that we must do away with the priesthood and offer believers a direct experience of the divine. His approach was even more controversial in that he did not shy away from the use of sexual mysticism (Tantra) as part of his system. Generally, the term Brethren of the Free Spirit has been used to denote those who combine Antinomianism with sex mysticism. Another example in this class is Heinrich Niclaes (1498-1561 CE), who not only taught that once you was born again you became free of sin and could live as you please, but that to become born again you had to experience a secret union with Christ through the Gnostic rite of the Bridal Chamber. While doctrines varied throughout the Free Spirit movement, there was a consensus regarding the nature of the ecclesiastical authorities - they were believed to be Babylon, the fallen harlot of the Book of Revelation. On the whole, the Free Spirit movements tended to be anti-reproduction, believed that all unions with unbelievers were cursed and that the use of sex was a major key within the redemption process. Out of all of the Free Spirit founders the most recognised was Marguerite Porete the authoress of the only fully extant Free Spirit Scripture, The Mirror of Simple Souls. Way before her time, she taught the equality of the sexes, the right not to reproduce and the freedom given by the Gnosis."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 207 The Alchemists The Alchemists The Alchemical tradition is varied and complex, it is difficult to summarise its role in the continuum of the Gnosis. It primary focus was the transmutation of man into God, the techniques for which were transmitted under the guise of chemical transformation. The texts of the Alchemists were coded to avoid the inquisition and hence sustained the secret tradition through the veil of symbolism. Some of the major Alchemical figures include Trithemius (1642-1516), Paracelsus (1493-1541) and Agrippa (1486-1535). The Rosicrucians and Knight Templars The Rosicrucians and Knight Templars Both the Knight Templars and the Rosicrucians are orders steeped in Mystery. The Knight Templars were, at first, considered to be simply an order for the protection of the roads along which pilgrims travelled to the Holy Land. However, as they become better known, rumours began to circulate about their esoteric knowledge and occult practises and this resulted in their persecution. Their teachings were dualistic with an emphasis on the union of the opposing male and female facets of consciousness, this process was reflected in their use of the image of Baphomet, an androgynous Pan like figure within their secret shrines. Their origins can probably be traced to 1188 CE when the Order of Sion split into two opposed factions, of which the Knight Templar was the major. As time progressed and their influence spread, the Knight Templars absorbed esoteric teachings from Arabic alchemy and Sufi mysticism - they form an important link in the transmission of the Gnosis. The Rosicrucians are thought to also have originated about the same time as the the Knight Templars. While their teachings are similar, the Rosicrucians had a much stronger mystical emphasis. The name Rosicrucian is from the image of the Rosy Cross, a single red rose superimposed on a crucifix. This icon had a wide spectrum of interpretations, but the primary emphasis was on the pain and suffering required to find the true Self and awaken it. In the Fourteenth century the Brothers of the Rose Cross made a somewhat public appearance by creating the myth of Christian Rosencrantz, a superhuman figure who had supposed lived for 106 years and left his secrets to the order. This had the desired effect and many Rosicrucian orders arose. In the Seventeenth century a range of manifestoes were penned by many members"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 208 of the Order (and many who spuriously claimed membership) and Lodges spread to England, France and Russia. Some of the more prominent members of this Order including Dr.Randolph (1825-1875), a famous occult author and master of the Societas Rosicruciana in London, Franz Hartmann (1838-1912), Theodor Reuss (founder of the Ordei Templi Orientis) and Eliphas Levi (1810-1875), whose works helped trigger the French Occult revival. In more recent time a plethora of authors have claimed membership of the Order. It seems likely that in the 1990’s the Rosicrucians are a spiritual rather than physical brotherhood. X"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 209 Introduction Introduction It seems such a long time between the revelation of Jesus and 1844, but in some sense things had not changed that much. Light was still battling against Darkness, and the Gnostic message was still being twisted and manipulated by the dominions of the Demiurge. While the names of the enemies may have changed, their approach was remarkably similar. As the battle intensified, energies on both sides prepared for the change that was going to take place. On the side of the Light world many arose, each of which interpreted the transformation in their own way, and through the symbol systems of their own unconscious. However, confusing this may seem at first glance, if we look behind what they wrote and said, and ignore the great variance in symbolism, we can deduce a similar core vision. Between 1844 and 1914 something momentous occurred, there was a change in the energy which operated through the Seat of Ra. In terms of astrological cycles, the Equinox of the Gods had begun. This change was and is of significance because it caused an acceleration of the forces of the Kali Yuga and is bringing mankind face to face with his destiny. Observers of the Change Observers of the Change The change which began in 1844 was accelerated at the various points of emphasis. As a year has its seasons, the Heraldic age has four nexus dates - 1844, 1904, 1964 and 2004. To fully appreciate the nature of these dates and the Heraldic period as a whole we need to come to some understanding of the various schools of thought which observed it. This is a difficult thing because all of these schools were not necessarily aware of the nature of the change. Each experienced something, but that something varied according to the symbol-system of the school. In some sense it is"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 210 akin to what may happen if we interviewed a range of people about a robbery which occurred a week or so ago. Each would have seen the event according to their own psychological structure, prejudices and values that are part of their make-up. While each maintain their objectivity and may even vigorously defend their interpretation of events (and in some sense they are being true to what they perceive ), each would report only their own perception of the event, not the facts of the actual event itself. In the case of the changeover, The Equinox of the Gods, the observers varied greatly and saw it in many differing terms. Some saw it in terms of Christianity, others in terms of Sufism and still others in terms of the western magical tradition then represented in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. This is made all the more awkward by the fact that many of these observers formed religions and organisations based on their perceptions, many of which still exist today. Accord- ingly, we have a bizarre situation where an observer of a historical and spiritual event is transformed into the prophet or herald of a religious movement. For the Gnostic, while each of these observers are of value and have important things to say, we do not assign religious significance to them individually. Some are certainly more admirable than others, a number are very difficult to take and in the case of Aleister Crowley, many would seem him as a malefic rather than inspira- tional figure. The fact however is that morality is somewhat irrelevant, what we want are perceptions and records of the transition that occurred at the Equinox of the Gods. While psychological makeup certainly needs to be considered in evaluat- ing the information we receive, it is the information that is important, not the behavior and personal whims and fancies of the individual involved. If we accept that all observers were biased and interpreted the event according to their psycho- logical makeup, then we can perhaps deduce a core knowledge of what occurred. It is of little significance what movements, organisations or Churches they formed, since these religious bodies were only founded on their partial understanding or limited perceptions. In many cases the dictum that “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing” certainly applies to the organisations that resulted."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 211 The Nature of the Change The Nature of the Change The Heraldic age is in preparation for a transition which is a changeover in the energy form that exists in the Solar Logos. In simple terms, the archetype which is the focus of the Seat of Ra will change from Horus to Maat, Pisces to Aquarius. This change will bring about a significant variation in the experience of humanity, both in terms of Light and Darkness, Positivity and Negativity. All aspects of the fourfold Solar Cross (negative and positive X and Y factors) are influenced by the changeover. As the Heraldic period takes hold, humanity is drawn throught the transition and experiences vibrations of both a Piscean and Aquarian nature. At each of the nexus dates within the Heraldic period, the energies further accelerate and transform. Religious Perceptions of the Change Religious Perceptions of the Change There were many who witnessed the start of the Heraldic period from the percep- tion of traditional Christianity. In the Adventist movement people were experienc- ing revelations and visions as early as the 1830’s, as 1844 came close they became convinced that Jesus was to return at that date. They were sorely disappointed. Interpreting what they experienced in Christian terms, they came to the conclusion that they had misunderstood the momentous event. They then evolved a complex theology whereby in 1844 Jesus changed his role and function. Jesus’ moved from being a priest in the outer temple, to being the High Priest in the Holy of Holies. For the Adventists (now Seventh Day Adventists) there was a tabernacle, like that of Israel, in the heavens and starting in 1844 Jesus began to officiate at the judgement of the dead. This doctrine was evolved in association with complex systems of Prophecy taken from the Old Testament which clearly suggested some esoteric event was to occur around this time. The doctrine of investigative judgement places the Seventh Day Adventists outside the general doctrinal position of many other Christian denominations. The theology of the Adventists actually offers a fascinating perception of the Equinox of the Gods. Ellen.J.White and the other visionaries of the Adventist movement obviously perceived a change in the energies that existed, and even perceived a change in the nature or focus of these forces. While at first they"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 212 interpreted these in traditional theological terms (i.e. the physical return of Jesus), they later evolved a more complex spiritual understanding of the event. In some sense their iconography is very accurate, the energy has changed from a priestly to High Priestly function, from sacrifice to Theosis (deification). The Jehovah Witnesses offer another intriguing series of perceptions. While there are various different interpretations of their doctrine, the early Jehovah’s Witnesses believed that Jesus would return in 1914. When he failed to arrive, they came to understand that he had returned, but in a spiritual sense. While they look forward to Jesus being physically present at the future final Judgement they believe that the return of Jesus as prophesied in the Bible has already occurred. This too is a meaningful perception of the Equinox of the Gods, the energies of Pisces are returning in the form of Aquarius, Jesus has re-appeared in the Heraldic cycle in the sense that the Christ or Solar Logos is undergoing transformation. These are intriguing religious interpretations of a very occult event. Occult perceptions of the Change Occult perceptions of the Change Aliester Crowley is not an easy man to write about. He is worshipped by some and reviled by others, he is seen as either a master magician or an evil genius, a con man or a God. For the Gnostic he is none of these things, he is just a man - nothing more, nothing less. The soul that inhabited the body of Edward Alexander Crowley when he came to earth on the 12 th October 1875 had spent many centuries preparing. By throwing off the restraints of convention, morality and orthodoxy it opened up to the dimensions beyond the physical and beheld the Equinox of the Gods. There was, however, one problem, Crowley was very much the product of a Victorian society, so everything that he experienced, every vision he had, every revelation he received, was filtered through the conditioning he received in his youth and the occult training of his adulthood. Crowley's understanding of the change of ages is still, however, of great relevance. If we strip away the grandstanding and arrogance of Crowleyanity we find a comprehensive record of the Equinox of the Gods. The major difference between the Gnostic and Thelemite view is that there is no evidence a new Aeon began in 1904. The Aeon of Horus, which many claim began on this date, was the age heralded by Jesus and James and existed since the dawning of the Piscean Age. Crowley's revelation was a re-instatement of the primal Gnosis and a witness to the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 213 start of the Heraldic Period, which has been developing since 1844. For the Gnostic it is important to see Crowley and indeed the whole Golden Dawn tradition as part of the Gnostic continuum rather than allowing them to be re-interpreted by those who want to emphasize the ritual magic over the intense spiritual vision they possessed. On 14 th March 1904 Crowley and his then wife Rose were in a flat in Cairo. They had prepared a room for ritual invocation, it faced North. Crowley called, as usual, on the Egyptian God Thoth. However this time something strange occurred, his wife Rose fell into a trance state and began to chant “they are waiting for you”. This continued until the 18 th of the month. During this day’s invocation the startled Rose exclaimed “He who is waiting is Horus”. As the story unfolds Crowley invokes Horus and feels that he has communication with a being called Aiwass, who is an ancient Egyptian Priest. Aiwass then dictates to Crowley “the Book of the Law”- a cryptic book of three chapters. What are we to make of Aiwass and the Book of the Law ? While Aiwass claims to be a messenger of Horus he does sound a lot like Aleister Crowley, however at the same time, there are complex numerical codes within the Book of the Law which suggest it is not a conscious fraud. Aiwass could be best seen as a personification of the innermost Will of Crowley himself. It is that True Self or Will, which being beyond time was able to contemplate the transition which was occurring in the Solar Logos. It is ludicrous to see Aiwass as some sort of extra-terrestrial using Crowley as the medium or Prophet of a new age. Crowley himself had a love/hate relation- ship with both Aiwass and the Book of the Law and conveniently lost it for some years in his attic ! The Book of the Law is classic unconscious material. It is Crowley's individual experience of the Equinox of the Gods as filtered via his own psychological structure. It could be said to be is his “Selfs” perception of what was occurring in the spiritual world. It cannot be construed as a Bible as some “Crowleyites” would have it. It is useful in that it offers a good summary of some pertinent aspects of what is changing during the Equinox of the Gods."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 214 The central premises of the Book of the Law (Liber AL vel Legis) can be culled from three specific verses... Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. AL 1:40 Love is the law, Love under Will. AL 1:57 Every man and every woman is a Star. AL 1:3. Every man and every women has the potential to be awakened, this awakening can only occur through Transfiguration and the forging of the true Will or Self. Every Will is unique and has its own path (or orbit), the path is the Law for that Star. True Love can only be experienced between Stars (those who have awakened their true self), it is the cohesion between Stars that binds the universe together. There is much else of value in The Book of the Law but it must be understood in the context of the continuum of the Gnosis, to see it as a unique revelation that has started a new movement is to end up as ignorant as the Christians that Crowleyites dislike so much. It is also clear that it cannot be taken at face value, its symbolism, gematria and imagery are as complex anything Crowley consciously wrote and hence must be decoded rather than read. With my Hawk’s head I peck at the eyes of Jesus as he hangs on the cross. AL 3:51 One of the more interesting verses in the Book of the Law contains its reflection on Christianity, it is found in the third section of the Book of the Law (the secion dedicated to Horus) and its primary thrust is in verse fifty one. This is an important verse which has many levels of meaning, it is not just trivial blasphemy. Why does Horus (the Hawk) only peck at the eyes of Jesus ? The answer is because the eyes"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 215 represent perspective, perception, even worldview - here the worldview of modern Christianity, as represented by the crucified Jesus, is said to be wrong. The whole of Christianity is not rejected, the Gnosis is not condemned, it is a matter of the way in which the teachings of Jesus have been manipulated. This is of great significance when we consider the Gnostic revival which has occurred in the Heraldic period and the need for a re-evaluation of Christianity in light of the Gnostic tradition. There is also a deeper, more esoteric meaning. The eye in Gematria is Ayin, it is related to the Devil in the Tarot and represents illusion, emptiness. Another level of interpretation is that the Hawk (Horus) is attacking Jesus on the cross because he is a false Jesus, this is hinted at by the focus on the eye or Ayin. The Jesus being attacked is the false Jesus created by the Apostate Churches and used to control the masses. What emphasizes this inner interpretation is the meaning of the number of the verse, fifty one according to Sepher Sephiroth is the number of Edom. Edom being the name given to the Pharisees or false Israelites who in the Gnositic Identity tradition brought about the apostate form of Christianity in the first place. Both of these interpretations give us important clues regarding the message of the Remnant age and its relation to conventional forms of Christianity. Madame Blavaskty Madame Blavaskty Madame Blavaskty was another who felt the great change that was occurring. She was born in Russia in 1831 and in her early life trained as a circus hand and piano teacher, as her skills as a psychic developed she became an assistant to the famous medium Douglas Home. She travelled widely including such exotic locations as Tibet and the Himalayas. In 1873 she began teaching her own form of spiritualism, but this soon gave way to her unique adaptation of the esoteric teachings which came to be known as Theosophy. She believed that she was in intimate contact with the Mahatmas or Secret Chiefs who were the spiritual masters behind mans development. They outlined to her an esoteric system of thought which was to be of great significance as the Equinox of the Gods unfolded. Her earlier works such as Isis unveiled and the Secret Doctrine offer encyclopaedic interpretations of the Mysteries, while later works (and works by other Theosophical authors) seem to focus more on eastern than Gnostic traditions, they are nevertheless of value. As time progressed Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater (members of the inner"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 216 school of Theosophy) became convinced that the change they were sensing was physical rather than spiritual and they trained a young man named Krishnamurti to be the embodiment of the new current. This misinterpretation brought undue stress and finally calamity on the society when Krishnamurti rejected the role of world Messiah. It is interesting however, to see how occultists and Christians can both misinterpret the Equinox of the Gods and look for physical rather than spiritual manifestations. Gurdjieff Gurdjieff Gurdjieff, like Blavaskty and Crowley, is another character than is either loved or loathed. He was born in 1872 in Alexandropol on the Russian-Persian border and was initiated as a child into the Yezidi cult. This was followed by a twelve year exploration of Asia, Europe and Africa. His first teaching took place in the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Mankind which he founded in Russia, this Institute was later moved to France due to the intervention of World War I. The significance of Gurdjieff was that he sensed that the time was right for mankind to awake, he outlined a powerful system in which he taught that man was asleep and that mankind as a whole spent their whole lives in that state. He emphasised the need for a superhuman act of Will to go beyond the sleep we are in and the need for a new path for the present age. He argued that the paths of the Fakir, Monk and Yogi were for the old age and a new path was needed for the present period. The Philosopher of the Equinox of the Gods The Philosopher of the Equinox of the Gods - Fredrich Nietzsche - Fredrich Nietzsche We have considered some religious and occult perceptions of the Equinox of the Gods, there are obviously many more, we could fill a whole book just considering many of the perceptions people had of the change that occurred. When it comes to philosophy it is much the same, however, one name stands out above the others - that of Fredrich Nietzsche."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 217 Nietzsche was born in Rocken in Prussian Saxony in 1844. He studied theology at Leipzig university but soon abandoned his studies as he realised the degenerative state of German theology. He completed a doctorate in Philology and continued to teach it for some ten years at Basil. He began a study of philosophy first basing his work on Schopenhauer and then going beyond to create his own unique system based on the Will to Power. The philosophy of Nietzsche is an embodiment of the Gnosis for the present age, his voluminous works such as Thus Spake Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, the Anti-Christ and many others are of exceptional value in understanding the philosophical foundations of the present period. Some of the key concepts found within Nietzsche's philosophy which coincide so well with the Gnostic tradition include the Will to Power, the Overman, the abandonment of the traditional decayed forms of religion and science, the cycles of eternal re-occurrence, the need to go beyond mundane forms of morality and the power of strength, love and Will to achieve liberation. The Dark Side of Aquarius The Dark Side of Aquarius There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. Genesis 3:4-8"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 218 For I see and behold that demons have begun their seductions against you and against your children and now I fear on your behalf that after my death ye will shed the blood of men upon the earth and ye too will be destroyed. The Book of Jubilees 7:27 And he testified to the Watchers, who had sinned with the daughters of men, these had begun to unite themselves, so as to be defiled. The Book of Jubilees 4:24 These quotes help us to picture a period way before that of our own. What occurred during this time is truly terrifying, Demonic forces came to earth and mated with the daughters of men and gave birth to every kind of mutation. These mutated creatures, called Nephilim were truly evil and hideous. They are discussed in many traditional theological works such as those of Clement, Alexander, Tertullian and Justin to name a few early Christian writers and Philo and Josephus to name a number of others. These beings brought such havoc to earth that after the flood the Elder Gods (emissaries from the Pleroma ?) created a special seal across the astral dimension which surrounds the earth and locked them away until the Omega day. According to the New Testament these forces were kept in a spiritual dimension called Tartaros. This is the meaning of verses six and seven in the New Testament book of Jude, these uniquely destructive demons are chained until the Last Days. This story may seem unbelievable, but the strange thing is that it is not just found in Biblical literature. Another source of this legend is found in the Old Arab mythology which centres on the Necronomicon. This unusual tale is central to many modern science fiction mythologies as well as to several occult orders. Yet when we examine modern renditions of the tale they have much in common with the Biblical epic. Probably one of the better known modern adaptations of the tale is found in the work of H.P Lovecraft. He is one of the more unusual observers of the New Aeon in that he never accepted his experience of the spiritual world. His childhood"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 219 was marred by neurosis and his view of the world alternated between that of an Overman and an neurotic invalid. He had little financial success, working as a ghost writer for most of his early life. Many of his tales came to embody a mythos he seemed to be consciously unaware of. It was the tale of the Necronomicon. I certainly do not aim to spend much time outlining the Necromonicon myth, however, a basic summary will give you the drift. The Necronomicon outlines a period in time when savage and heartless Gods ruled the Earth, these were violent and malefic entities who were called The Old Ones (Archons). At some time in the dim reaches of the past they caused so much havoc on earth that the Elder Gods locked them away in another dimension and sealed the Gateway. Modern Necro- nomicon tales discuss how Atomic energy and the decay of modern society has eroded the seals and that the Old Ones are returning. Legend has it that man will have to decide on which side to fight in a cosmic battle of frightening proportions. Another modern link with this myth is the work of Occultist Kenneth Grant, a enigmatic figure who originally carried on the research of Aleister Crowley. His published works seem to be obsessed with attempting to manifest the Old Ones, indeed many occultists believe he is perhaps possessed by the very forces he evoked. In his later works, Hecate's Fountain and the Mauve Zone there is little to save his reputation. Descriptions of alien sexual encounters and the death of students through possession by the Old Ones certainly suggest that Grant and many others are under the influence of the Demiurgic kingdom. While we may think some of these occult occurrences are just madness, if we correlate the tales with the Biblical story of fallen Angels we begin to see a hauntingly similar pattern. We are moving at lightning speed towards the Omega Day and the Gateway is opening, if you are not on the side of Treasury of Light (The Elder Gods ?), then you are fair-game for the Old Ones. Perhaps some of the strange descriptions of the Books of Revelation and Daniel are not that farfetched after all !"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 220 The Resurfacing of the Gnosis The Resurfacing of the Gnosis As the Heraldic period moves towards Aquarius mankind is heading towards a new period of both hope and destruction. The Kali Yuga is also accelerating towards its conclusion in blood and annihilation, Ragnarok is certainly on the way. At the same time, as the ages change, the Treasury of Light is working overtime to awaken man. During this century the Dead Sea Scrolls, Nag Hammadi Library and other finds have offered an unprecedented opportunity for us to be re-aquainted with the Gnosis. Gnosticism has become the talk of the town and yet that is all it is for most - talk. Traditional Christianity has reached its most degenerative and barbaric form and is blinding the masses from appreciating their true position. Science continues to spew forth its nihilistic materialism, but offers little vision. The pleroma is demanding mans transformation - he must either develop or cease to be. The Path of Transfiguration is calling those who realise that their only hope is to go beyond the human condition, to reject the values of the earth, to fight against the cycles of eternal re-occurrence and return home to the Treasury of Light. The Equinox of the Gods is a final call to mankind, it is the last opportunity before the age ends and the Judgement of Maat begins.

All beings so far have created something beyond themselves, and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man ? What is ape to man ? A laughing-stock or painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the Overman, a laughing-stock or painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape. Whoever is wisest among you is a mere conflict and a cross between plant and ghost. But do I bid you become ghosts or plants. Behold I teach you the Overman. Thus Spake Zarathustra Fredrich Nietzsche."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 222 Behold ! I teach you the Overman. The Overman is our vision of post-human development, he is a new creation, a new man. We may visualise the early stages of mans experience as worm and ape, yet man is a transition between ape and the Overman and his value is as a transition and not an end. The cycles of planet earth create a wave, this wave is circular and perpetual. It is the wave of re-occurrence, this wave carries on physical life as we understand it and is collective not individual. When a creature dies, it does not go to Heaven, the Lands of the Creator or to some Elysium Gardens, it returns to the wave. There is no separate or discrete individuality in the wave, only a constant repetition of life and death, returning to the earth is the nature of the cycle. However, for man to spiritually mature, he must break free from the earth. As a child breaks free from the bosom of its mother, as a bird throws its children out of the nest so they may grow, so man must struggle for liberation. It is the greatest in, the only one that cannot be forgiven, to stay at the bosom of mother earth. For to stay in the relative safety of the earth is to destroy the only opportunity for immortality, the New Man. The New Man is the birth of the true Self, the Overman. He has broken free from the eternal cycles of earth and achieved post human status. He has been liberated from the Archonic dominion of the Demiurge and experiences the light of the Pleroma. He is strength, lust and nobility. There can be no individual immortality in the wave, only in the ecstasy of the Overman, this is the essence of the Gnosis. Morality and Ethics Morality and Ethics It is too easy to speak of morals in a conservative society. There are so many dogmas whether they come from the right or the left, religion or sociology. For the Gnostic it is clear that equality is a deception, no one is really equal. While the politicians may scream “all men are created equal” reality slaps us in the face and we realise that this is a matter of social policy rather than everyday experience. Every path to the divine is unique, we experience the flood of past lives in different ways and therefore our present conditions vary greatly. Nobody is the same, nobody is equal and we must each individually decide whether our personal charade will continue. However, one thing we can be sure of, is that the Kali Age is accelerating, mans degeneration is reaching its peak. While technology has become more and"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 223 more refined, the content of our lives has become more and more decayed. We have quantity, but little quality. Television, video, computers, virtual reality - all flood our lives with information, information that seems important, relevant, even necessary - yet that information keeps us asleep, conditioned, stupid and servile. In the past there was always time to spare, we could have a family, spend lifetimes exploring and growing, leave our spiritual growth to later in life. The old Hinu tradition was that life could be a stroll through its various stages and conditions. We could divide our lives into sectors and as old men and women we could retire to the forest and contemplate God. Even within the Gnostic tradition we have extolled the virtues of the Paths of the Dove and the Serpent and the slow and steady hierarchical progress of the soul. There is one large problem however, that looms in front of us. Time is short ! Ragnarok is coming, Armageddon is around the corner. It is no use enrolling in the high school if you know that the school will burn down before graduation. As the final trumpets begin to blow and the blood laps against our ankles, we need to seriously consider the urgency of Transfiguration. Reproduction was always only just tolerated in the past by Gnostic sects, today it should be viewed aghast. The time for family values and children is over - the only new being you should be creating is yourself ! The path of the Dove is useful only insomuch as it leads you to the wisdom of the Serpent. Do not waste time sprouting moralisms and platitudes, face yourself and become what you are truly meant to be. While morals, ethics, social values have always played a part in the outercourt of the Gnosis, it is time to go beyond good and evil and venture within. There are maps available for your inner journey, but you must chart your own course. The very things that would drive the average man to hell for thousand years may save your very soul. Good and evil are the twin sides of one coin, the coin of obedience and rebellion, repetition and denial, all of which keep us safe and sound within cycles of the wave of re-occurrence. The Gnosis is an experience, a thunderbolt - which leads us beyond the yeses and noes of mortal life."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 224 The Will to Power The Will to Power Within the soul herself is the message of immortality, it is the forbidden fruit and woe to those who pluck it from her breast. The fruit of immortality is the gift of the Will to Power, it is the reason behind existence. It is brutal and strong and is beyond the qualms and queasiness of little men and petty tyrants. It is pure dynamic force, yet encompasses and goes beyond the Libido of Freud and the integrated Self of Jung. Be aware, however, it is not mindless violence, foolish ego and petty domination. It is pure unhampered Self, and within it thrust lies the fullness (Pleroma) of individual immortality. It is the flash of light which awakens the soul as it is issued from the Treasury above, it is the transition beyond humanity. I forgot to say that such philosophers are cheerful and that they like to sit in the abyss below a perfectly clear sky, they need different means from other men for enduring life, for they suffer differently (namely from the profundity of their contempt for man as from their love for man). Hence the most suffering animal invented for itself - laugher. Fredrich Nietzsche. The Will to Power, No 990 (1885) The Will to power transforms the Gnostic’s view of the world, he sees humanity for how they really are. This vision of the world, sometimes called The Vision of Pan , can drive the unprepared mad. For to see the futility and stupidity of human existence, the meaningless desire to create more anguish, to reproduce, to populate, to pass on the burdens and sins of our forefathers is enough to destroy even the strongest soul. To see the panorama of human existence as we emerge into each life naked, alone, weak and ignorant and leave each life much the same. Mankind is a decayed and malefic species, caught in a cosmic battle from which we cannot escape. As the darkness increases mankind becomes more and more materialistic, believing that science, pleasure and social values will save him and yet, as the news clearly shows, there is no real development, no redemption, no salvation, only more violence, destruction and death. The Gnostic must stand away from humanity, when the light within him has been awakened, he has been changed forever. Many will"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Gnostic Theurgy Page 225 try and attack that which exposes their sickness and hence to be awakened is to be in danger. We must share the wisdom with thosewho seek it but let the others reap the crop they have sown. Our Vision Our Vision And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see vi- sions, and your old men shall dream dreams Acts 2:17 Transfiguration is not something that can be easily conceptualised. The human psyche is dominated by the Archons and the Demiurge, our emotions are flooded with alien feeling which come from the malefic clouds of dark spirits which surround the earth, our bodies are poisoned with instincts alien to our spiritual goals. We are manipulated by our cellular programs, genes and memes mar our way. It is impossible to communicate the essence of the dimension, world or reality we originated from, the Treasury of Light and the Lord of Wisdom is so far away on every possible level. Truth is alien to us because we have never known it, as wisdom is revealed, it is twisted and turned to poison. The Kali Yuga is rolling over the earth and taking mankind with it, at the same time the forces of the Conquering sun child of Horus offer man a last chance to wake up and realise his plight. But be warned, Horus is the god of war as well as of liberation, the sun can dry up and parch a desert as quick as it can causes flowers t bloom. If we do not heed the call from the world of Light to awaken and be transformed, then as the Kali Yuga ends and time reaches its final days, as the Omega Day explodes onto our planet, then we shall surely cease to be and there will be nothing of us left - no thought, record - not even a trace. Annihilation is the hell that awaits those who do not have the eyes to see. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear Matthew 11:15 X X"}]
