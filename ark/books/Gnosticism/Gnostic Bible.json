To know oneself truly allowed gnos- JL. tic men and women to know god 1 directly, without any need for the mediation of rabbis, priests, bishops, imams, or other religious officials. 1. Throughout the present volume we have tried to avoid unnecessary capitalization of the word god and the names of personified spiritual powers and aeons. We are aware that the word god may be used as a name for the divine, but it frequently functions as a general term for the divine, so that even when \"god\" appears to be a name, it retains its primary nature as a term signifying the concept of divinity. For the same reason, other names of divine expressions, such as divine forethought, afterthought, and wisdom, are likewise left uncapitalized. Conversely, for the sake of clarity, when the Greek word \"Sophia\" is used for wisdom, that is capitalized, as are other names that are transliterated directly from other languages. We also want to avoid the common practice of singling out a particular deity, for example, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic deity, for the exclusive honor of the capitalized name \"God,\" while other deities are relegated to the status of mere \"gods\" and \"goddesses.\" We do not wish to limit the divine by restricting deity through name or selectivity. Traditionally the name and face of the divine are essentially unknowable, and so it is in this volume."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"2 INTRODUCTION Religious officials, who were not pleased with such freedom and independ- ence, condemned the gnostics as heretical and a threat to the well-being and good order of organized religion. Heresiologists—heresy hunters of a bygone age who busied themselves exposing people judged dangerous to the Christ- ian masses—fulminated against what they maintained was the falsehood of the gnostics. Nonetheless, from the challenge of this perceived threat came much of the theological reflection that has characterized the intellectual his- tory of the Christian church. The historical roots of the gnostics reach back into the time of the Greeks, Romans, and Second Temple Jews. Some gnostics were Jewish, others Greco- Roman, and many were Christian. There were Mandaean gnostics from Iraq and Iran; Manichaeans from Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and all the way to China; Islamic gnostics in the Muslim world; and Cathars in west- ern Europe. The heyday of their influence extends from the second century CE through the next several centuries. Their influence and their presence, some say, continue to the present day. Gnostics sought knowledge and wisdom from many different sources, and they accepted insight wherever it could be found. Like those who came before them, they embraced a personified wisdom, Sophia, understood vari- ously and taken as the manifestation of divine insight. To gain knowledge of the deep things of god, gnostics read and studied diverse religious and philo- sophical texts. In addition to Jewish sacred literature, Christian documents, and Greco-Roman religious and philosophical texts, gnostics studied reli- gious works from the Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Zoroastrians, Muslims, and Buddhists. All such sacred texts disclosed truths, and all were to be celebrated for their wisdom. Gnostics loved to explore who they were and from where they had come, and hence they read creation stories such as the opening chapters of Genesis with vigor and enthusiasm. Like others, they recognized that creation stories not only claim to describe what was, once upon a time, but also suggest what is, now, in our own world. The gnostics carried to their reading a conviction that the story of creation was not a happy one. There is, they reasoned, something fundamentally wrong with the world, there is too much evil and pain and death in the world, and so there must have been something wrong with creation. Consequently, gnostics provided innovative and oftentimes disturbing in- terpretations of the creation stories they read. They concluded that a distinc- tion, often a dualistic distinction, must be made between the transcendent,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 3 spiritual deity, who is surrounded by aeons and is all wisdom and light, and the creator of the world, who is at best incompetent and at worst malevolent. Yet through everything, they maintained, a spark of transcendent knowledge, wisdom, and light persists within people who are in the know. The transcen- dent deity is the source of that enlightened life and light. The meaning of the creation drama, when properly understood, is that human beings—gnostics in particular—derive their knowledge and light from the transcendent god, but through the mean-spirited actions of the demiurge, the creator of the world, they have been confined within this world. (The platonic aspects of this imagery are apparent.) Humans in this world are imprisoned, asleep, drunken, fallen, ignorant. They need to find themselves—to be freed, awak- ened, made sober, raised, and enlightened. In other words, they need to return to gnosis. This distinction between a transcendent god and the creator of the world is all the more remarkable when it is recalled that many of the earliest gnostic thinkers who made such a distinction seem to have been Jews. What might have led them to such a conclusion that seems to fly in the face of Jewish monotheistic affirmations? Could it have been the experience of the political and social trauma of the time, culminating in the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, which prompted serious reflection upon the problem of evil and stimulated the production of Jewish apocalyptic compositions? Could it have been the reflection of hellenistic Jewish thinkers who were schooled in Judaica and Greek philosophy and recognized the deep philosophical and the- ological issues surrounding the transcendence of the high god and the need for cosmic intermediaries to be involved with this world? Could it have been that among the creative Jewish minds, representative of the rich diversity of Judaism during the first centuries before and of the Common Era, who boldly addressed the real challenges of Jewish mysticism before Kabbalah, of the wis- dom and Hokhmah of god, of world-wrenching apocalyptic, of theodicy and evil in the world, there were those who finally drew gnostic conclusions? We know the names of some of these creative Jewish people: John the baptizer, who initiated Jesus of Nazareth and preached apocalyptic ideas in the vicinity of Qumran, where Covenanters and Essenes practiced their separatist, ethical dualism; Simon Magus and Dositheos, who lived about the same time as Jesus and advocated their ideas in Samaria and beyond; Philo of Alexandria, a hel- lenistic Jewish thinker who provided Greek philosophical perspectives on the Hebrew Bible; Rabbi Elisha ben Abuya, nicknamed Aher, \"Other,\" who dabbled in dualism; and there were more. We shall encounter some of these Jewish"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"4 INTRODUCTION thinkers in this volume. John the baptizer becomes the gnostic hero of the Man- daeans, Jesus of the Christian gnostics. Simon Magus may lurk in the back- ground of several gnostic texts, and Dositheos is said to be the compiler of the Three Steles of Seth. Others, mostly unnamed, may have made similar contri- butions to the discussion of the profound question of the transcendent god and the demiurge. The role of the gnostic savior or revealer is to awaken people who are under the spell of the demiurge—not, as in the case of the Christ of the emerging or- thodox church, to die for the salvation of people, to be a sacrifice for sins, or to rise from the dead on Easter. The gnostic revealer discloses knowledge that frees and awakens people, and that helps them recall who they are. When en- lightened, gnostics can live a life appropriate for those who know themselves and god. They can return back to the beginning, when they were one with god. Such a life transcends what is mundane and mortal in this world and experi- ences the bliss of oneness with the divine. As the divine forethought, or Christ, in the Secret Book of John says to a person—every person—in the pit of the underworld, \"I am the forethought of pure light, I am the thought of the vir- gin spirit, who raises you to a place of honor. Arise, remember that you have heard, and trace your root, which is I, the compassionate.\" Gnostic literature includes a typical cast of spiritual or mythological fig- ures and realms, but they are referred to by different names. Above and beyond all is the transcendent deity. In the Book of Baruch this deity is called the Good and is identified with the fertility god Priapos. In the Secret Book of John and elsewhere this deity is called the One, or monad, as well as the invisible spirit, virgin spirit, and father. It is said that the One should not be confused with a god, since it is greater than a god. Elsewhere the transcendent is called the boundless, depth, majesty, light. Poimandres reveals itself as the light, mind, first god. Mandaeans call this deity the great life and lord of greatness, Manichaeans the father of greatness, Muslim mystics the ex- alted king, Cathars the invisible father, true god, good god. The glory of the transcendent is made manifest in a heavenly world of light. In the classic literature of gnostic wisdom this exalted world is often called the pleroma or fullness of god, and the inhabitants of this world are called aeons or eternal realms. The first of the aeons is usually the divine mother. For Simon Magus she is Helena, or ennoia, the thought of god. In the Secret Book of John she is Barbelo, or pronoia, the first thought or forethought of god. Thunder, in the text by that name, has certain similarities as well. Sometimes the transcendent father and the divine mother produce a child in"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 5 spiritual love. Often the aeons are identified as spiritual attributes of the di- vine, are given names, and are joined together as couples, spiritual lovers in the fullness of the divine. In the Mandaean divine world the great life is surrounded by other lives and a host of Jordans, or heavenly waters; in the Manichaean kingdom of light the father of greatness is surrounded by 12 aeons and 144 aeons of aeons; and in the Mother of Books the exalted king is surrounded by seas, angels, lights, and colors. Among the aeons and manifestations of the divine is often a figure who represents the divine in this world, fallen from the light above yet present as the light of god with us and in us. In many gnostic texts this is the figure called Sophia or wisdom, as mentioned above. In Valentinian traditions two forms of wisdom are evident, a higher wisdom called Sophia and a lower wisdom called Achamoth. Wisdom is closely linked to Eve in the creation stories, and Eve is portrayed as the mother of the living and a revealer of knowledge. Wis- dom may also be linked to the gnostic revealer, and wisdom may take part in the process of salvation. In the Gospel of John and other texts the divine logos, or word, plays a similar role. Such is also the case with Ruha, the spirit, in Mandaean texts, and perhaps Salman, including great Salman and lesser Salman, in the Islamic Mother of Books. As noted, the demiurge or creator of this world is commonly distinguished from the transcendent deity in gnostic texts. The demiurge is ignorant, tragic, megalomaniacal. In the Secret Book of John he is depicted as the ugly child of Sophia, snakelike in appearance, with the face of a lion and eyes flashing like bolts of lightning. He is named Yaldabaoth, Sakla, Samael, and he is the chief archon and an arrogant, jealous god. In the Gospel of Truth error behaves like the demiurge, for it becomes strong and works in the world, but erroneously. Similar, too, are the actions of nature in the Paraphrase of Shem, Ptahil in Mandaean literature, the five evil archons in Manichaean literature, Azazi'il in the Mother of Books, and Lucifer or Satan among the Cathars. The gnostic revealer awakens people who are under the spell of the demi- urge. Within a Jewish context the gnostic revealer is Seth, the child of Adam and Eve, or Derdekeas, probably Aramaic for \"male child,\" or the first thought or the afterthought or the wisdom of the divine. Within a Christian context the revealer is Jesus the anointed, within a Manichaean context Jesus of light, as well as others. More abstractly, the call to revelation and knowledge—the wake-up call—is a winged divine messenger in the Song of the Pearl, instruc- tion of mind in Hermetic literature, and enlightened Manda dHayye, knowl- edge of life, in Mandaean literature. In other words, the call to knowledge is"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"6 INTRODUCTION the dawning of awareness, from within and without, of \"what is, what was, and what is to come.\" It is insight. It is gnosis. In gnostic literature those who come to knowledge are described in differ- ent ways. Occasionally they are specifically called gnostics; the Mandaeans are also called by the word that means \"gnostics\" in Mandaic. More often they are named the unshakable race, or the seed or offspring of Seth, or the gener- ation without a king, or the elect or chosen, or, in the Mother of Books, the ones who know. With a mystical flourish the Gospel of Philip recommends that rather than be called a Christian, a person with knowledge might be un- derstood to be at one with the gnostic revealer and be called Christ. This re- calls the Gospel of Thomas, saying 108, where Jesus says, \"Whoever drinks from my mouth will become like me. I myself shall become that person, and the hidden things will be revealed to that one.\" Such people of knowledge know how to live profoundly and well in the truth and light of god. The Gospel of Truth concludes, \"It is they who manifest themselves truly, since they are in that true and eternal life and speak of the perfect light filled with the seed of the father, which is in his heart and in the fullness, while his spirit rejoices in it and glorifies him in whom it was, because the father is good. And his children are perfect and worthy of his name, because he is the father. Children of this kind are those whom he loves.\" The sacred texts presented in this volume all help to clarify what gnosticism is and who the gnostics were. The similarities and differences among these texts are equally instructive, as are the connections among them, whether historical or phenomenological. The early \"wisdom gospels\" of Thomas and John, both perhaps dating from the first century CE, portray Jesus as a speaker of wise words or even as the divine word itself, which is itself \"wisdom.\" These early wisdom gospels represent incipient gnostic perspectives, and they were used extensively by later gnostics, so that their impact upon the history of gnosti- cism was huge. The classic literature of gnostic wisdom dates from the second century CE, and some materials in the literature are probably even older. Justin's Book of Baruch illustrates a Jewish form of gnosticism with Greco-Roman allusions. So does Sethian gnostic literature, with its provocative Jewish inter- pretation of the opening chapters of Genesis and its emphasis on the special roles of Eve, the mother of the living, and Seth, whom the Sethian gnostics claimed as ancestor. Valentinian gnostic literature is named after the great second- century teacher Valentinos, who, along with his students, seems to have made use of Sethian insights in order to fashion an elegant gnostic system for"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 7 reflecting upon the origin and destiny of true life and light. In Syria, the sacred literature relating to Thomas is closely related to the wisdom gospel of Thomas; Thomas is understood to be the twin of Jesus and the guarantor of his wisdom and knowledge. The Hermetic literature dates from the first century CE and after. It is named after the Greek god Hermes, the divine messenger, nicknamed Tris- megistos, \"thrice-greatest,\" and depicted in a syncretistic way, once again with Jewish and Greco-Roman themes, along with Egyptian motifs. The Man- daeans consist of Middle Eastern gnostic communities that exist to the pres- ent day, now in locales around the world. The Mandaeans interpret the opening chapters of Genesis in a typically gnostic manner, but they reserve a special place for John the baptizer, whose style of Jewish baptismal piety they considered to reflect the origin of their communities. Manichaean literature dates from the time of the prophet Mani, the third-century prophet who, with his followers, created a world religion intended to be universal. Manichaeism draws from Zoroastrian, Buddhist, and Christian sources, likely including the Gospel of Thomas and other gnostic texts, in order to announce how the di- vine light of the cosmos may be saved from the machinations of the forces of darkness and gathered into the kingdom of light. Some of the songs in the Coptic Manichaean Songbook appear to be related to Mandaean literature, and Manichaeism and Mandaeism show connections with each other. Such Islamic mystical texts as the Mother of Books, as well as Cathar sacred literature, are sometimes described by scholars as late gnostic or neo- manichaean, because of similarities with the traditions of Mani and his fol- lowers. The Mother of Books comes from the eighth century CE and represents a form of Islamic ghuluw, which literally means \"exaggeration.\" The Cathar texts come from medieval Europe and offer a dualistic message of the triumph of light over darkness. The Cathars, too, like so many gnostics, venerated the Gospel of John. The Gospel of the Secret Supper features John and cites a por- tion of the Gospel of John as it announces the glory that will finally come to the children of the good god of light: \"The just will glow like a sun in the kingdom of the invisible father. And the son of god will take them before the throne of the invisible father and say to them, 'Here I am with my children whom you have given me. Just father, the world has not known you, but I have truly known you, because it is you who have sent me on my mission.'\" In assembling a \"Gnostic Bible,\" what definitions have we used? Where have we drawn the line? Let us examine our definitions more carefully."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"8 INTRODUCTION The term gnostic is derived from the ancient Greek word gnosis, \"knowl- edge.\" Gnosis is a common word in Greek, and it can designate different types of knowledge. Sometimes, as in the sacred texts included in this volume, gno- sis means personal or mystical knowledge. Understood in this way, gnosis may mean acquaintance, that is, knowledge as personal awareness of oneself or another person or even god, or it may mean insight, that is, knowledge as immediate awareness of deep truths. These ways of understanding gnosis are not mutually exclusive, for knowledge may entail the immediate awareness of oneself or of another, in a personal union or communion that provides profound insight into the true nature of everything. As we have already noted, the Gospel of Thomas has Jesus articulate just such a mystical per- sonal knowledge. The gnosis sought by the authors of these texts is hardly ordinary knowl- edge. A text from the Nag Hammadi library, the Exegesis on the Soul (included in this volume), declares that the restoration of the soul to a state of wholeness \"is not due to rote phrases or to professional skills or to book learning.\" Indeed, mystics commonly have emphasized, in many books, that mystical knowledge cannot be attained simply by reading books. Other texts describe this sort of gnosis by listing questions that need to be addressed if one is to be enlightened by knowledge. In the Secret Book of John the savior or revealer announces that she or he will teach \"what is, what was, and what is to come,\" and in the Book of Thomas the revealer commands, \"Examine yourself and understand who you are, how you exist, and how you will come to be.\" To attain this knowl- edge—to become a gnostic—is to know oneself, god, and everything. Or, in the words of the maxim from the ancient oracular center dedicated to Apollo at Delphi, Greece, a maxim cited frequently in the texts in this volume: gnothi sauton, \"know yourself.\" According to many of these sacred texts, to know one- self truly is to attain this mystical knowledge, and to attain this mystical knowl- edge is to know oneself truly. Gnostic knowledge, then, relies on lived mystical experience, on knowledge of the whole timeline of the world, past, present, and future, and on knowledge of the self—where we have come from, who we are, where we are going—and of the soul's journey. Thus, the Greek word gnosis was used extensively by people in the world of Mediterranean antiquity, including the people who wrote the texts in this vol- ume, but among the heresiologists the word was employed in a particularly polemical fashion. The heresiologists were heresy hunters who, as the guardians of truth and watchmen on the walls of Zion, were trying to expose people judged to be dangerous to the masses, especially the Christian masses."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 9 The more famous of the heresiologists include Irenaeus of Lyon, whose major work was Adversus haereses, \"Against Heresies\"; Hippolytus of Rome, who wrote Refutatio omnium haeresium, \"Refutation of All Heresies\"; Pseudo- Tertullian (an author writing under the name of Tertullian), who wrote Ad- versus omnes haereses, \"Against All Heresies\"; and Epiphanius of Salamis, who authored a particularly nasty piece entitled Panarion, \"Medicine Chest,\" with an orthodox remedy for every heretical malady. The neoplatonist philosopher Plotinos of Lykopolis also wrote a heresiological treatise, Against the Gnostics, according to his student Porphyry. All these heresiologists focused, to one ex- tent or another, upon the supposed gnosis of the heretics, and they suggested that at least some—even if only a few—of the heretics could be called gnos- tikoi, gnostics, or referred to themselves as gnostikoi. While these heretics used the word gnosis, they did not necessarily call themselves gnostics. Irenaeus wrote five volumes against heresies, and he claimed to have composed an \"ex- pose and refutation of falsely so-called knowledge.\" Irenaeus and his fellow heresiologists, motivated by a religious zeal to expose and refute people with whom they disagreed, were rather sloppy and imprecise in their use of terms and their enumeration of heresies. Yet their presentations of gnosis, \"falsely so-called gnosis,\" have played a role, albeit a polemical one, in defining the terms gnosis, gnostic, and gnosticism in modern discussions. The widespread use of the word gnosis (and similar words in other lan- guages, for example, in Coptic and Latin), and the polemical application of this word and related words among the heresiologists, have created a challenge for scholars and students who wish to understand gnosticism. What is gnosti- cism, the religion of gnosis? Gnosis is a word widely attested in the ancient world, but the word gnosticism itself is a term not attested at all in antiquity or late antiquity. Rather, it first was used in the eighteenth century to designate the heretical religious groups discussed by the heresiologists. Are gnosticism and gnosis valid categories for analysis? Who actually were the gnostics? These questions have become even more interesting when scholars have reflected upon gnosticism and gnosis in relation to hermetic, Mandaean, Manichaean, Shi'ite, and Cathar religions. Further, the discovery and publication in recent times of primary texts (as opposed to the secondary texts of the heresiolo- gists) generally considered to be gnostic has raised the issues of definition and taxonomy in new and exciting ways. Among these primary texts are those from the Askew Codex (Pistis Sophia, or Faith Wisdom), the Bruce Codex, the Berlin Gnostic Codex 8502, and the Nag Hammadi library. The Nag Hammadi library is a treasure trove of Coptic texts, most previously unknown and many i"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"10 INTRODUCTION considered gnostic by scholars. The texts in the Nag Hammadi library were discovered around December 1945 near Nag Hammadi in upper Egypt, and they are now becoming available in editions and translations. A substantial number of texts in the present volume are from the Nag Hammadi library. Scholars of ancient and late antique religions have attempted to sort through the issues of definition and taxonomy in order to reach some clarity regarding gnosis and gnosticism. In 1966 many of the leading scholars of gno- sis gathered at an international conference in Messina, Italy, and produced a set of statements that are meant to define gnosis and gnosticism. Gnosis, they maintain, is \"knowledge of the divine mysteries reserved for an elite,\" and this is a term of very broad application. On the other hand, gnosticism is \"a coher- ent series of characteristics that can be summarized in the idea of a divine spark in man, deriving from the divine realm, fallen into this world of fate, birth and death, and needing to be awakened by the divine counterpart of the self in order to be finally reintegrated.\" 2 Gnosticism is thus a religious move- ment represented by religious groups that emerged in the second century CE and after, especially within the context of Christianity, groups such as the fol- lowers of Basilides and Valentinos, two particularly significant early Christian teachers of gnostic religion. This distinction between gnosis and gnosticism resembles that of Hans Jonas in his books The Gnostic Religion and Gnosis und spatantiker Geist, in which he distinguishes between the gnostic principle—\"the spirit of late antiquity\"— and the gnostic movement or movements. The gnostic religion, Jonas sug- gests, is a religion of knowledge, with \"a certain conception of the world, of man's alienness within it, and of the transmundane nature of the godhead.\" 3 This knowledge is communicated creatively in myths, which contain themes borrowed freely from other religious traditions and which employ an elabo- rate series of symbols. The end result, according to Jonas, is the expression of religious dualism, dislocation, alienation—\"the existing rift between God and world, world and man, spirit and flesh.\" 4 Whereas Valentinian gnostics (and others) seek to derive dualism from a primordial oneness, Manichaean gnos- tics begin with a dualism of two opposing principles. But both options remain dualistic. 5 For Jonas, these expressions of gnostic dualism can be articulated 2. Bianchi, ed., Le origini dello gnosticismo, p. xxvi. On the history of the discussion of gnosti- cism, see King, What Is Gnosticism? 3. Jonas, Gnostic Religion, p. 101. 4. Ibid., p. 237. 5. Today scholars are arguing about whether or not the Manichaeans were truly gnostics, as Jonas affirmed."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 11 in terms of modern philosophical existentialism. The gnostic drama high- lights the self-experience of a person as Geworfenheit, \"thrownness,\" aban- donment of self in the world. As the Secret Book of John and other texts describe it, one is thrown into this world, into a body, into the darkness. Yet, Jonas states, \"There is no overlooking one cardinal difference between the gnostic and the existentialist dualism: Gnostic man is thrown into an antago- nistic, anti-divine and therefore anti-human nature, modern man into an in- different one. Only the latter case represents the absolute vacuum, the really bottomless pit.\" 6 Ancient gnostics and modern existentialists may both be ni- hilistic, but we modern folks, in our post-Christian world, face the more pro- found abyss: the uncaring abyss. For gnostics, there is light in the darkness and hope in the abyss. More recently scholars have questioned these ways of describing and defining gnosis and gnosticism. Here we shall consider three significant at- tempts to shed new light on the gnostic debate, those by Elaine Pagels, Bentley Layton, and Michael Williams. 1. In The Gnostic Gospels, Elaine Pagels admits that Jonas's book The Gnos- tic Religion remains \"the classic introduction,\" but in her own book Pagels de- picts gnostics in a different way. 7 She reads the gnostic gospels and draws conclusions about social and political concerns that motivated the gnostics. Thus, for Pagels, the gnostics formulated teachings on the spiritual resurrec- tion of Christ that subverted the emerging orthodox church's hierarchy of priests and bishops, whose authority was—and still is—linked to the messen- gers or apostles who were witnesses of the bodily resurrection of Christ. The gnostic teaching on spiritual resurrection and spiritual authority, Pagels ob- serves, \"claimed to offer to every initiate direct access to God of which the priests and bishops themselves might be ignorant.\" 8 Again, Pagels notes that the gnostics formulated teachings on the multiple manifestations of god, the mother and the father, that subverted the emerging orthodox church's com- mitment—which still can be found—to the authority of one bishop, and a male bishop at that. In these and other ways, as Adolf von Harnack once said and Pagels also recalls, the gnostics may have been the \"first Christian theolo- gians,\" whose ideas and actions stimulated theological thinking in the Christ- ian church. In Pagels's view, the gnostics lived as freethinking advocates of a 6. Ibid., p. 338. 7. Pagels, Gnostic Gospels, p. xxxi. 8.

To many readers of Pagels's book the gnostics seemed to advocate a more attractive sort of spirituality than that of the orthodox priests, bishops, and heresiologists, and they seemed to be on the right side of many issues that remain important issues to the present day. Pagels was accused by some reviewers of portraying the gnostics in too attrac- tive a fashion. Nonetheless, The Gnostic Gospels offers a compelling portrayal of the gnostics as freethinking mystics who recommended a direct experience of god, unmediated by church hierarchy. 2. In The Gnostic Scriptures, Bentley Layton assembles an anthology of gnostic texts in English translations as authoritative gnostic scriptures. The title of Layton's book is close to the title of our volume, and the conception is similar, though more limited in scope. Like the scholars assembled at Messina, and like Hans Jonas, Layton distinguishes between two meanings of the word gnostic: \"One is a broad meaning, denoting all the religious movements repre- sented in this book, and many more besides. The elusive category ('gnosti- cism') that corresponds to this broad meaning has always been hard to define. The other meaning of'gnostic' is narrow and more strictly historical: it is the self-given name of an ancient Christian sect, the gnostikoi, or 'gnostics.' \" 9 Lay- ton points out, as we have noted, that the words gnostikos, \"gnostic,\" and gnos- tikoi, \"gnostics,\" were uncommon in the world of antiquity and late antiquity, and that the Christian sect that called itself the gnostics has been nicknamed the Sethians, or else the Barbeloites, Barbelognostics, Ophians, or Ophites, by ancient heresiologists and modern scholars. These gnostics form the founda- tion for Layton's anthology, and Part One of his book, \"Classic Gnostic Scrip- tures,\" is devoted to gnostic works in this limited sense of the word. The subsequent parts of his book have additional texts—texts written by Valen- tinians, by the followers of Judas Thomas, and by proponents of the systems of Basilides and Hermetic religion. Michael Williams, in his book Rethinking \"Gnosticism\" (discussed next), ap- plauds Layton's efforts to be as exact as possible in his use of terms, but he points out that the Coptic primary texts classified by Layton as classic gnostic scripture do not refer to themselves as gnostic and are not indisputably gnostic. The term gnostic is not used in so simple a way as Layton maintains, Williams continues; for example, Irenaeus says that the followers of a woman named Marcellina 9. Layton, Gnostic Scriptures, p. 5."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 13 called themselves gnostics, but Layton does not include them anywhere in his anthology. Yet, in spite of Williams's protestations—and with his grudging ac- knowledgment—it must be admitted that Layton has convincingly demon- strated the connections among a variety of texts that are gnostic. In the present volume we too shall feature these classic or Sethian gnostic texts prominently in Part Two of our book, \"Literature of Gnostic Wisdom.\" 3. In Rethinking \"Gnosticism,\" Michael Williams is more negative is his as- sessment of the word gnosticism. He argues for \"dismantling a dubious cate- gory,\" the dubious category being gnosticism itself. Williams begins by giving his own definition of gnosticism: \"What is today usually called ancient 'gnos- ticism' includes a variegated assortment of religious movements that are at- tested in the Roman Empire at least as early as the second century CE.\" 10 While he casts his net widely in his discussion of this set of religious movements, Williams does not include Hermetic, Mandaean, Manichaean, and later reli- gions in his discussion. He does survey the use of the terms gnosis and gnostic in both the heresiological sources and the primary gnostic texts, and he finds that rarely do gnostics seem to have described themselves as such, and the oc- casional use of the term gnostic among the heresiologists is uneven, ambigu- ous, and contradictory. Further, the effort on the part of scholars to employ gnosticism as a typological category has also failed. Scholars have proposed, variously, that gnosticism was an anticosmic protest movement, or an inno- vative religion of adoption and adaptation of other religious traditions, or a religion of spiritualists who hated the body, or of ethical radicals who opted for either an ascetic or a bohemian lifestyle, and so on. Williams judges that these descriptions of gnosticism are caricatures of a diverse set of religious movements—misguided efforts to define a single, overarching category called gnosticism. Instead, Williams proposes that we jettison the category gnosti- cism altogether and focus our attention on specific religious movements, for instance, the Valentinians. In addition, Williams suggests a new category to replace gnosticism: I would suggest the category \"biblical demiurgical traditions\" as one useful alternative. By \"demiurgical\" traditions I mean all those that ascribe the creation and management of the cosmos to some lower entity or entities, distinct from the highest God. This 10. Williams, Rethinking \"Gnosticism,\" p. 3."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"14 INTRODUCTION would include most of ancient Platonism, of course. But if we add the adjective \"biblical,\" to denote \"demiurgical\" traditions that also incorporate or adapt traditions from Jewish or Christ- ian Scripture, the category is narrowed significantly. In fact, the category \"biblical demiurgical\" would include a large percentage of the sources that today are usually called \"gnostic,\" since the distinction between the creator(s) of the cosmos and the true God is normally identified as a common feature of gnosticism.\" 11 Rethinking \"Gnosticism\" is one of the more thought-provoking books to have appeared in the past several years on the topic of the definition of gnosis and gnosticism. In spite of Williams's argument, however, in this volume we shall continue to use the term gnostic. We do so for three reasons. First, Williams concedes, as we have seen above, that Bentley Layton has brought some clarity to the discussion of what is gnostic, and he acknowl- edges with Layton that there are in fact connections among gnostic texts. The savvy of scholars from the time of the Messina colloquium and Hans Jonas to the present day is vindicated in the continual use of the terms gnosis, gnosti- cism, and gnostic, though now with important qualifications. We too shall continue to make use of these terms. Second, Williams stresses the widespread diversity within the category gnosticism, and of course he is correct in doing so. Yet his recognition of gnos- tic diversity merely parallels the similar recognition by scholars of diversity in Judaism and Christianity. This recognition of diversity has led Jacob Neusner to suggest \"Judaisms\" and Jonathan Z. Smith \"Christianities\" as appropriate terms for these diverse religious movements. Perhaps we might also opt for \"gnosticisms\" or \"gnostic religions\" as a similar way of acknowledging the dif- ferences among religions of gnosis. Third, we continue to use the terms gnosis, gnosticism, and gnostic with a particular understanding of comparison and classification. In Drudgery Di- vine, Jonathan Z. Smith reminds us that comparisons do not necessarily tell us how things actually are as much as they tell us about the people doing the comparisons and their assumptions and perspectives. Smith notes that state- ments of comparison are triadic, with an implicit \"more than\" and an addi- tional \"with respect to.\" Thus, A resembles B more than C with respect to N. 11. Ibid., pp. 51-52."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 15 Seen in this light, statements of comparison are always relative and contextual. This understanding of comparison and classification may be helpful to us in our current discussion of what is gnostic. Contrary to those who doubt whether there is any set of traits (N) that allow us to compare and classify religions of gnosis as gnostic, in this volume we wish to suggest a set of gnostic traits that in fact may be helpful in com- paring and classifying texts and traditions. To do this, we begin by building on the observation that, according to Ire- naeus of Lyon, the people we here refer to as Sethians defined and described themselves as gnostics. Here is the historical basis for the use of gnostic as a valid term of self-definition. Next we continue to explore who the gnostics were by identifying traits that were characteristic of these Sethians who called themselves gnostics. Ire- naeus helps us by citing sacred materials that were used by Sethian gnostics, and it turns out that these materials are remarkably similar to the classic Sethian text entitled the Secret Book of John, presented prominently below. Through a careful examination of the Secret Book of John we identify five traits that we suggest are central to this gnostic text and that guide us in un- derstanding Sethian gnostics. The Secret Book of John proclaims the impor- tance of (1) gnosis, or mystical knowledge, (2) understood through themes of wisdom and (3) presented in creations stories, particularly in Genesis, and (4) interpreted through a variety of religious and philosophical traditions, in- cluding platonism, (5) in order to announce a radically enlightened way and life of knowledge. These five traits, we propose, may help us describe the lead- ing features of Sethian gnostics. Finally, we extend the use of the terms gnostic and gnosticism to other movements that appear to be linked to Sethian gnostics historically or that resemble Sethian gnostics phenomenologically. Sometimes there seem to be historical connections between Sethian gnostic texts and texts that are repre- sentative of some other sort of gnosis, and at other times there seem to be clear similarities in content and theme. This wider application of the terms gnostic and gnosticism allows us to classify comparable texts and traditions as repre- sentative of gnosticism. In this volume, then, we understand the following to be the traits of gnos- tic religions: 1. While the spirit of late antiquity exhibits certain gnostic features, as Hans Jonas has shown, religious movements that are to be classified as gnostic"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"16 INTRODUCTION religions in a specific sense are those that give a primary place to gnosis, unmediated mystical knowledge, as the way to salvation and life. 2. Gnostic religions typically employ wisdom traditions that are related to the Jewish family of religions but are usually influenced by Greek thought, and wisdom (or another manifestation of the divine) is often personified as a character in a cosmic drama. 3. Gnostic religions typically present stories and myths of creation, es- pecially from the book of Genesis, interpreted in an innovative man- ner, with the transcendent divine spirit commonly distinguished from the creator of the world, often to the point of dualism, in order to ex- plain the origin, estrangement, and ultimate salvation of what is di- vine in the world and humanity. 4. In their explanations and interpretations, gnostic religions typically make use of a wide variety of religious and philosophical traditions and find truths in a diversity of sources, such as Jewish, Greek, and other sources, including platonism. 5. Gnostic religions typically proclaim the vision of a radically enlightened life that transcends the mundane world and attains to the divine. These traits of gnostic religions come to expression, to varying degrees, in the sacred texts that are included in this volume: wisdom gospels, classic texts of gnostic religions—Sethian, Valentinian, Syrian, and other gnostic re- ligions—and Hermetic, Mandaean, Manichaean, Islamic, and Cathar texts. These traits, though derived from an analysis of a Sethian text of fundamen- tal significance from a tradition that understood itself to be gnostic, do not necessarily come to expression in a uniform way in the texts included here— recall what lonathan Z. Smith said about the relative nature of comparisons. Yet all of the texts included in this volume address the interests of gnosis and gnosticism. The term bible is derived ultimately from the ancient Greek word biblos (or byblos), meaning \"papyrus,\" the reed used to make a primitive sort of paper in order to construct scrolls and codices, or books, in the world of ancient book- binding. The Greek word was also written in a diminutive form, biblion; the plural is biblia, \"books.\" Within the context of Judaism and Christianity cer- tain books came to be associated with the sacred scriptures, which in turn were eventually referred to in the singular, the Bible. Thus, within the history"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 17 of the use of the term, the Bible, or the book, designates a collection or an- thology of sacred texts. We can explain how this set of meanings came to be associated with the word Bible by examining the process of establishing a canon or canons within Judaism and Christianity. Organized religions usually teach that adherents to a given religion should observe the tenets of the tradition in a way that is right, proper, and correct according to a given canon. (Originally a canon was a cane or reed, a measuring stick, but the term came to be applied to any standard by which one might determine whether a person's thoughts or actions measure up to the standard of correctness in the tradition.) Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are religions of the book, and so their canons are written canons, au- thoritative books and anthologies. For Judaism and Christianity, their author- itative books are the Hebrew Bible (or, more exactly, the Tanakh, that is, the Torah [\"law\"], Neviim [\"prophets\"], and Kethuvim [\"writings\"]) and the New Testament (or the New Covenant), respectively. The Hebrew Bible was used in antiquity in Hebrew and in Greek translation. The Greek version called the Septuagint was completed in Alexandria, Egypt, by bilingual Jewish translators during the first centuries BCE. A legend emerged that the Septu- agint was written in a miraculously identical fashion by seventy-two transla- tors who labored in pairs over a period of seventy-two days. The Septuagint was the Bible of the early Christian church, which originated, after all, as a Jewish religious movement. This Greek translation of the scriptures of Ju- daism contains several texts not included in the Hebrew Bible—for example, Baruch, 1 Esdras, Judith, 1-4 Maccabees, Sirach, Tobit, and the Wisdom of Solomon. To this day the inclusion or exclusion of these texts contained in the Septuagint remains a canonical issue among Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Orthodox Christians. The formation of the New Testament as the Christian Bible was a gradual process that took centuries to complete. Finally, at the Council of Trent in 1545, the Roman Catholic Church acted to recognize its list of biblical, canon- ical books as final, that is, closed to any additions or subtractions. (Minor changes from the work of textual critics are quietly incorporated into new printings of Bible translations.) Many Protestant denominations have never acted officially to recognize a biblical canon. While there is widespread agree- ment among Christians concerning what books should be included in the New Testament, the traditions of the Syrian and Ethiopic churches have claimed that different sets of texts should be included in the Christian canon. Today some are proposing the Gospel of Thomas as an authoritative Christian"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"18 INTRODUCTION text, and the Jesus Seminar in Santa Rosa, California, is discussing the possi- bility of a new New Testament, a new Christian Bible. Arguably the most influential person in the process of the formation of a New Testament was a second-century Christian teacher, a dyed-in-the-wool dualist named Marcion of Sinope. Marcion is sometimes included in discus- sions of the gnostics because of his radical dualism, but his Christian religion was a religion of faith rather than gnosis. In this volume we consider Marcion to be an unrepentant Paulinist, with a literalistic way of reading the Bible, rather than a gnostic. As one prominent scholar quipped, the only person in the sec- ond century who understood Paul was Marcion, and he misunderstood him. Marcion was a rich shipowner turned evangelist who went to Rome in the middle of the second century in order to contribute his money and his teach- ings to the Roman church. Both were returned to him. Marcion preached that the good and loving god, revealed in Christ, must be distinguished from the just and righteous god, who was the god of the Jewish people. Marcion's the- ological dualism, with all its anti-Semitic implications, necessitated for him the creation of a new Bible, a new authoritative book for the god newly re- vealed in Christ. Marcion wrote a book, a rather simple-minded piece called the Antitheses, with quotations from Jewish and Christian texts that seemed to Marcion to show the striking contrasts between the Jewish god and the Christian god. Marcion also formulated a Christian canon—as far as we can tell, he was the first Christian to come up with the idea of a separate Christian Bible. He knew of a series of letters of Paul, and he knew of the Gospel of Luke, which he considered Paul's gospel, and he combined these into his New Testa- ment. And when he read in Paul's letter to the Galatians that some trouble- some people want to \"pervert the gospel of Christ\" (1:7), he took the words seriously and literally. He assumed that lackeys of the Jewish god were per- verting the written texts by penning in words favorable to the Jewish god and the scriptures of the Jewish god. Marcion responded as a highly opinionated textual critic by removing the sections of Paul's letters and Luke's gospel that he thought needed to be erased in order to restore the texts to their original form. For Marcion's misguided efforts his foe Tertullian chided him, \"Shame on Marcion's eraser!\" Marcion proved to be popular and influential as a leader of his church, but only for a time. Eventually he was rejected by many Christians, including the heresiologists, and declared a heretic. The Christians opposed to Marcion dis- liked his insistence on two gods and his rejection of Judaism and the god of the Hebrew Bible. Instead, such Christians looked for continuity in the history"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 19 of salvation from Judaism to Jesus and beyond. Yet the Christian canonical idea of Marcion carried the day, as did Marcion's basic outline of the Christ- ian canon, with a gospel section and an epistolary (Pauline) section. From the perspective of the Christian Bible, Marcion lost the battle but won the war. When we refer to the texts in the present volume as The Gnostic Bible, we are in this world of discourse. We are presenting these texts as sacred books and sacred scriptures of the gnostics, and collectively as sacred literature of the gnostics. But in this Bible of the gnostics there is no sense of a single, author- itative collection. The sacred literature in this Bible illustrates a diversity that we have suggested is characteristic of gnostic religions. Further, the sacred lit- erature in this Bible constitutes no closed canon. We present here what we judge to be the most significant gnostic texts, but there are other gnostic texts that have not been included. All these gnostic texts may be equally authorita- tive, truths may be discovered in a variety of texts and traditions, and the way to wisdom and knowledge cannot be closed. Such a sense of wisdom and knowledge has made this sacred literature attractive to free spirits in the past and equally fascinating to many in the present day."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"LETTING IN THE LIGHT Translating Holy Texts WILLIS BARNSTONE Spiritual and mystical scriptures survive on the fire of art. Without the fire the new word is dead. —Pierre Grange, \"On Translating the Holy\" g_ J uminating about literary translation is an ancient habit. A pri- I ^L mary idea has been that the aesthetic of the original should JL. ^k— shine in translation. If that old news were remembered, we might stop here. But for more than a century most versions of religious scrip- ture have retained a formulaic, archaizing lexicon. Sadly, when the source is both religious and supremely literary, as are the canons of major religions, the aesthetic disappears in the transfer, whether out of religious faith or academic purpose. The voice, the song, the whisper go unheard. They are not treated as the holy scripture of Homer or Dante. To maltreat Homer and Dante as the Bible has been hurt would be heresy. To be sure, religious translation has enjoyed supreme moments. There was the plain and immeasurable beauty of the Tyndale New Testament (1536) and the holy strength of the King James Version (1611). The James, or Autho- rized, Version was accomplished by some forty-seven scholars, who had been instructed to revise earlier versions. With Tyndale as their main source and genius as their guide, the Authorized's scholars remade the English language and letters forever. Then, in the shadow and authority of the magnificent King James, came imitations and corrections and a plunge to the pedestrian."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"22 INTRODUCTION Anonymous teams in the Bible industry invented a compromise English, without written or spoken precedent, but the greater readership either held to the Authorized Version or ceased reading the Bible altogether. Early in the twentieth century, the reigning poet and critic T. S. Eliot denounced Gilbert Murray's wooden versions of the Greek classics, but there was no similar regal figure to demand new, vibrant versions of sacred scripture. Finally, late in the twentieth century came a change in climate and pub- lishing ventures. There appeared the lovely translations of Richmond Latti- more's New Testament and Robert Alter's Genesis and 1 and 2 Samuel. Their example—of great erudition, of fresh fidelity to the complexity, range, and beauty of the word—has proved that Bible translation need not be a weak mirror of a vital past. There is every reason to expect a turn to the larger task of doing the whole Bible in a version, or versions, worthy of the past and our time. \"Seamus Heaney's 'Beowolf' rises from the dead,\" wrote Richard Eder in his review of Heaney's new translation the Old English epic. Eder concluded (perhaps prophetically), \"Translation is not mainly the work of preserving the hearth—a necessary task performed by scholarship—but of letting a fire burn in it.\" 1 Much scholarly translation of religious scripture sees the English ver- sion fundamentally as a crib or gloss for reading the source text. These tools are laudable for reading and understanding a foreign page. Facing-page edi- tions are attractive, and the interlinear pony serves as a dictionary for a quick return to the source tongue. Word-for-word versions are a good initial step to converting a foreign page, but verbal misery enters when the student or scholar thinks that the English pony captures the poetry of Horace. An ex- treme example of literalism is that of Aquila, a second-century proselyte Jew from Pontos, who spent his life retranslating the Hebrew Bible into Greek to replace the Septuagint. He reproduced every word and idiom from the He- brew and followed Hebrew syntax whenever possible. Of course it was au- thoritative, sacred, and unreadable. When today the \"you\" in sacred texts is translated as \"you (sing.)\" and \"you (plur.),\" Aquila from Pontos has returned, and he is not singing. In rendering ancient languages into English, each age has its own speech and demand for a natural reading experience. Most important, if the original is worth transferring to English, it must be rich in sound and sense and sover- eign in art. If scripture or myth, it has survived because of its breath and its style. 1. New York Times, February 22, 2000, p.

To make a work heard again, the translator must re-create that cunning of art. Then a text can move pleasantly from foreign obscurity into the light of our own familiar tongue. Religious scholars have the ancient tongues to bring meaning to obscure alphabets. That is their enormous virtue and power. Sometimes they are sci- entists seeking information transfer, a dream of absolute denotation, which is clearly incompatible with the connotative richness of scripture. Sometimes they are scholar artists in the act of translating, which is ideal, as in the in- stances of Lattimore and Alter. In contrast to the mainly dim renderings of religious texts, the last century saw classical literatures converted into vital contemporary speech. Robert Fitzgerald, Richmond Lattimore, and Robert Fagles, all meticulous scholars, have in distinctive ways given us splendid versions of Homer; and Fitzgerald has carried Virgil's Aeneid from Latin—the marble language, as Borges called it—into a resonant English poem. They have made Greek and Latin classics thrilling to read. Like the Bible translators, they translate largely the sacred— but the pagan sacred, not the Judeo-Christian. They renew Homer's bible and Hesiod's theogony, Aeschylus's sacramental drama and Sappho's prayer poems to Aphrodite. Those ancient religions of the Greeks are other, their creators infidel, but that was long ago, and those works that have survived the fires of iconoclasm are no longer a threat or rival heresy. So the translator is free. In contrast to later Bible translations, still profoundly affected by a his- tory of verbal piety, classical literature introduces no authority of faith for its translator poets to contend with and resolve. The Bible did find a way into nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature, decisively and influentially, but not through any new versions. It was the venerable King James Version that held sway and passed into the hearts of Blake and Whitman, and Hopkins, Eliot, and Thomas. There is no single secret of literary translation. In fact there are many ways, and none of them includes the notion of perfection, since perfection pre- sumes a perfect transfer from one tongue to another, ofa = b. Language is much too rich, on too many cognitive and aesthetic levels, to be reduced to the per- fection of a formula of equality. Only in purely denotive, physically measura- ble matters—ten acres of land, ten tons of pure iron ore—is exact translation possible and required. Even the slippery notion of \"exact equivalence,\" fash- ionable in contemporary translation circles, is deception.

As for method, closeness need not be a literary travesty, and great creative freedom may arise from the deepest understanding of the source text. In this the scholar may seem to have an advantage. But the next step is to re-create from the source, and there the writer enters. If the scholar and writer artist are one person, it is ideal. However, even the most erudite non-artist scholar, apart from creating a gloss, can only do harm to the aes- thetic of the original. Likewise, if the writer artist disdains knowledge of the source text, the result may be lovely but will not go beyond imitation. A fre- quent solution is to put scholars and writers together, which is exactly what occurred when the forty-seven men assembled to prepare the King James Ver- sion. Some contributed Hebrew, others Greek, others the sonorous word, and the result was that grand collaboration. Sometimes one person is both artist and scholar, as Robert Fitzgerald for Homer and Virgil, and Richard Wilbur for Moliere's verse plays. More commonly an informant and a writer collabo- rate intelligently as one voice. Pragmatically, there must be a meeting between the original creator and the writer who re-creates. When Robert Fitzgerald went to Saint Elizabeth's Hospital, where Ezra Pound was imprisoned, and asked the older poet how to render Homer into English, Pound said simply, \"Let Homer speak.\" It takes great courage to let the original author speak through oneself, the translator. There is always the temptation to listen obliquely or selfishly, and to convert the ancestor's voice completely into one's own. Some follow this temptation and produce masterpieces. Chaucer nobly practiced this art when he turned a Boccaccio tale into Troilus and Criseyde and Pound transformed the Chinese poet Li Bai into Cathay. More recently, David Ferry's translation of Gilgamesh, based on the work of earlier scholars, is a thoroughly felicitous achievement. The other Fitzgerald, Edward of The Rubdiydt of Omar Khayyam, in 1859 pub- lished his free adaptation from the twelfth-century Persian mystical poet. Se- lecting certain verses of the sequence, he arranged them in a new order. His work is praised as a classic of English literature, standing on its own, escaping the scarlet-T label of \"mere\" translation. It achieved the dignity of an original. So too the King James Version has for centuries been popularly received as \"original scripture\" containing the exact chapter and verse of \"gospel truth.\" Bringing words understood only by clergy into the light of common under- standing has historically required not only art but great courage as well. The history of these efforts is appalling."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 25 John Wyclif (1320-84), a master at Balliol College in Oxford, was the first to transfer the gospels into the modern vernacular. With impoverished preachers, who were called the Lollards, he took the gospels in English to the people. In 1401 Archbishop Arundel denounced Wyclif as heretical, fuming, \"The pearl of the Gospel is scattered abroad and trodden underfoot by swine.\" Arundel further wrote in his report to papal claimant John XXIII in 1421, \"This pestilent and wretched John Wyclif, of cursed memory, that son of the old serpent... endeavoured by every means to attack the faith and sacred doc- trine of Holy Church, devising—to fill up the measure of his malice—the ex- pedient of a new translation into the mother tongue.\" 2 The scholar's death saved him. Some associates were burned alive for their unauthorized vernac- ular renderings. Wyclif lay safely in the earth until 1424, when his bones were dug up, burned, and thrown into the River Swift. Etienne Dolet (1509-46) translated the Bible into French, but it was for translating Plato in such a way as to subvert the notion of immortality that he was tried for heresy and taken to the stake. However, in his Maniere de bien traduire d'une langue en aultre (1540), he did leave us five important rules of translating, of which the final one applies to all good writing: \"The translator must achieve harmonious cadences, he must compose in a sweet and even style so as to ravish the reader's ear and intellect.\" 3 William Tyndale dared to translate the New Testament into English. It is fair to say that he established the English language for the Bible: the King James Version of the New Testament is in large part Tyndale's phraseology. Tyndale's prose is clear, modern, minimally Latinized, and with unmatched narrative powers. Everything is fresh, including the use of very common words, unelevated for religious respectability. For \"his cunning counterfeit,\" which Bishop Wolsey called \"persiferous and most pernicious poison,\" he was arrested. It is good to remember that the word once had so much power to disturb. Sir Thomas More ranted allitera- tively against this \"devilish drunken soul,\" who challenged the hierarchy with his English phrases, which the lowest figure of society would receive without mediation of Latin or clergy. In what amounted to a poem of rage, More pro- nounced that \"this drowsy drudge hath drunken so deep in the devil's dregs that if he wake and repent himself the sooner he may hap to fall into draff that 2.

His life is of likelihood as evil as his teach- ing, worse it cannot be. He is a beast who teaches vice, a forewalker of an- tichrist, a devil's limb.\" 5 Yet none of these attacks could erase Tyndale's genius of plain word and humble ideal, nor hush his plea for a candle and a Hebrew dictionary to con- tinue his heretical translations as he lingered for nearly two years in his light- less cell. Tyndale's hope for a new audience coincided with that expressed by his admired Erasmus, whose work Exhortations to the Diligent Study of Scrip- ture Tyndale translated in 1529: I wold desire that all women should reade the gospell and Paules episteles and I wold to God they were translated in to the tonges of all men so that they might not only be read and knowne of the scotes and yrishmen But also of the Turkes and the Sarracenes. ...

I wold the wayfaringe- man with this pastyme wold expelle the weriness of his iorney. 6 Tyndale's translation of scripture into the everyday English was to expose the faithful to a forbidden text, a deed as heretical as revealing a proscribed gnostic scripture or of affirming the prime authority of Hebrew Scripture, which was routinely called \"the corrupt original.\" For his crime, on October 6, 1536, William Tyndale was taken to the stake, strangled by the hangman, and burned. An epilogue to Tyndale's death and his unfinished labor of Bible transla- tion came with the King James Bible, which accomplished under royal com- mand what William Tyndale courageously desired to do on his own. The preface to the James concludes with a line redeeming not only the vernacular version but the notion of the word as light, the logos asphos, which is also the spiritual essence of gnosticism: \"Translation it is that openeth the window, to let in the light.\" 4.

Though heterogeneous, they have a common flame of belief, a myth- ical memory of creation and gods, and a poetry that goes through all forms. The purpose of cosmic tale, exegesis, and sermon is to convert you, the ancient and now modern reader; to bring you along to a secret knowledge available within you. These scriptures have a generosity of spirit, and while they are not immune to issuing religious warnings, light overcomes darkness, and spirit rises internally above the confines of its earthly body. These are texts written by passionate philosophers and allegorizing exegetes. In these disparate groups, from China to Provence, who held that we are sparks of light caught in a perishable body, there is a constant excitement of the new and a freedom to invent and to contend with all dark error. The Cathars, the last major gnos- tic speculation, recalled and reinvented scripture, and their troubadours com- posed and sang with satiric fun and shocking candor—all while the swords of the Albigensian Crusade (1209) prepared to extinguish them. Now these ancient heresies, preserved in a variety of versions, survive as profound, powerful utterances. From the first-century Gospels of Thomas and John and the Book of Baruch to the twelfth-century Gospel of the Secret Supper, these copied and recopied and translated scriptures have haphazardly come down to us.

One of the earliest forms of exalted expression in the world of Mediter- ranean and Middle Eastern antiquity was wisdom. Wisdom can be both the product of experience and the gift of the gods. Wisdom is what the father teaches the son, the parent the child, the sage the student. Through wisdom and knowledge, people learn how to speak and act among family and friends and foes, in social encounters, in the political arena, on the street. Through wisdom and knowledge, people learn about the world and the ways of the world, and how to cope with it. Through wisdom and knowledge, people ad- dress the ultimate questions: Why do the wicked prosper? Why do the good suffer? What is the end of human life? Is this all there is? ANCIENT SAGES AND WISDOM LITERATURE From the times of the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians, wisdom and knowledge have been seen as keys to a good and successful life. So in Egypt an old sage, under the name of Ptahhotep, offers advice to his \"son\" with every- day observations and clever turns of speech: \"Do not let your heart be puffed up because of your knowledge. Do not be confident because you are wise. Take counsel with the ignorant as well as the wise. The full limits of skill cannot be attained, and there is no skilled person equipped to full advantage. Good speech is hidden more than the emerald, but it may be found with young women at the grindstones.\" Again: \"If you are a leader commanding the affairs of the multitude, seek out for yourself every beneficial deed, until it may be that your own affairs are without wrong. lustice is great, and its appropriate- ness is lasting; it has not been disturbed since the time of the one who made it, I"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"32 EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS whereas there is punishment for one who passes over its laws The strength of justice is that it lasts.\" 1 In ancient Mesopotamia, wisdom is also praised, often as a gift of the gods. In one text an unnamed sage praises wisdom and the divine lord of wisdom, here understood to be Marduk, god of Babylon, whose way is both terrible and gentle: \"I will praise ... Marduk, the lord of wisdom, the deliberate god, who lays hold of the night but frees the day, whose fury surrounds him like a storm wind, but whose breeze is as pleasant as a morning zephyr, whose anger is irresistible, whose rage is a devastating flood, but whose heart is merciful, whose mind forgiving . . . whose hands the heavens cannot hold back, but whose gentle hand sustains the dying.\" 2 In the ancient Greco-Roman world, wisdom was the domain of the philosopher, the lover of wisdom and knowledge, who dispenses wisdom and knowledge. Those philosophers with Cynic proclivities, so named for their rough, doglike lifestyles, employ witty sayings with a Cynic bite in order to teach the good and noble life. Thus: \"Marcus Porcius Cato, when asked why he was studying Greek literature after his eightieth year, said, 'Not that I may die learned but that I may not die unlearned.'\" And: \"The Pythagorean philoso- pher Theano, when asked by someone how long it takes after having sex with a man for a woman to be pure to go to the Thesmophoria, said, 'If it is with her own husband, at once, but if with someone else's, never.'\" And again: \"When Diogenes the Cynic philosopher saw a country boy scooping up water in his hand in order to drink, he threw away the cup that he was carrying in his bag and said, 'Now I can be this much lighter.' \" 3 In the world of early Judaism, sages are revered for their insight into the human condition before god, and sometimes the wisdom they proclaim is personified as Hokhmah (in Hebrew) or Sophia (in Greek), terms of feminine gender used to indicate wisdom as the female expression of the divine. The figure of wisdom in Judaism echoes the earlier goddesses of wisdom in other traditions—Maat in Egypt, Ishtar in Mesopotamia—and wisdom's career continues through the gnostic texts published in the present volume. In Proverbs wisdom herself is said to raise her voice: i. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts, p. 412. 2. Ibid., p. 596. 3.

You the simple, learn prudence; acquire intelligence, you the foolish. Listen, for I have noble things to say, and from my lips will come what is right. Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. Wisdom is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire compares with her. 1 wisdom live with prudence and possess knowledge and discretion. The lord brought me forth as the first of his works, the first of his acts of old. Ages ago I was set up, at the beginning before the world began. I was at his side like a master worker and was filled with delight, rejoicing before him always, rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in his people. (Proverbs 8:4-6,10-12, 22-23, 30-31) This ancient wisdom, which provided ideas of how people might live with insight, virtue, and happiness, proved to be compelling, and wisdom sayings were communicated both by word of mouth and in written form. In the an- cient world, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greco-Roman, and Jewish books of wisdom were compiled and circulated widely. The wisdom literature of an- cient Egypt and Mesopotamia dates back to the second and third millennia BCE with collections of wisdom sayings by sages such as Amenemhat, Amen- emope, Ptahhotep, Shuruppak, and Ahikar. The Cynic sayings from Greco- Roman times were collected in textbooks called Progymnasmata. These sayings were called chreiai, \"useful sayings,\" and they were judged useful for rhetorical instruction and for the conduct of life. The Progymnasmata were"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"34 EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS used within educational systems into the Byzantine period and far beyond, even into the modern world, in educational systems in Europe and the Amer- ican colonies. Jewish wisdom literature is included within the Hebrew Bible and elsewhere. Some of the prominent books of Jewish wisdom are Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, the Wisdom of Solomon, and Sirach, as well as the tractate Pirke aboth (Sayings of the Fathers), which is included in the Talmud. JESUS THE JEWISH SAGE Within this dynamic world of ancient wisdom, Hokhmah, Sophia, Jesus of Nazareth (or Yeshua, using his Semitic name) was born to humble beginnings in Galilee, in Israel. In later christology Jesus would attain the stature of di- vinity, but his actual life may have been closer to that of a wisdom teacher— that is, a rabbi. The Christian gospels and other theological statements describe Jesus as the Christ, the messiah, the anointed, the son of god and son of man (or earthly son, human son, human child—several translations are used in this collection). According to the Gospel of John, Jesus is the word of god, god in human flesh. The Apostles' Creed proclaims that he was born of the virgin Mary, raised from the dead on the third day, and taken up into heaven, and the Nicene Creed acclaims him as \"true god of true god, begotten not made, of one substance (homoousios) with the father.\" 4 Thus Jesus was pro- moted to be a full member of the godhead, the second person of the divine trinity, composed of god the father, Christ the son, and the holy spirit. Sev- eral texts comment on the possibility of the holy spirit as the mother—the true mother—of Jesus, including the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip, and the Secret Book of James in this collection. But the dogmatic Christ of the Nicene Creed and the other Christian creeds is hardly the same person as Jesus of Nazareth. Precisely who Jesus was as a historical person continues to be debated among scholars, and there is no consensus. During much of the twentieth century it was assumed, following Albert Schweitzer, that Jesus was an apocalyptic visionary who foresaw—mis- takenly—the end of the world and the dawning of the kingdom of god. 4. The Greek word homoousios was hotly debated at the Christian church councils, at Nicaea and elsewhere, and some people preferred the word homoiousios, \"of a similar substance,\" to the word destined to be voted in as the orthodox term. What a difference a single letter in a Greek word, the modest Greek iota (z), can make! No wonder that some parties in the christo- logical debate protested the use of any such Greek word in confessions about Christ. Use only biblical terms, they pleaded, but they were destined to lose the battle."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS 35 Schweitzer's paragraph in his Quest of the Historical Jesus presents a powerful image of the apocalyptic Jesus: There is silence all around. The baptizer appears, and cries, \"Re- pent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" Soon after that comes Jesus, and in the knowledge that he is the coming son of man lays hold of the wheel of the world to set it moving on that last revolution which is to bring all ordinary history to a close. It refuses to turn, and he throws himself upon it. Then it does turn, and crushes him. Instead of bringing in the eschatological con- ditions, he has destroyed them. The wheel rolls onward, and the mangled body of the one immeasurably great man, who was strong enough to think of himself as the spiritual ruler of hu- mankind and to bend history to his purpose, is hanging upon it still. That is his victory and his reign. 5 That is his victory, that is his reign, that is the kingdom. Jesus was convinced that the kingdom of god would come soon, but he was wrong, Schweitzer claimed—heroically wrong, yet dead wrong. Today many scholars are questioning whether Schweitzer and others were right in proposing that Jesus was first and foremost an apocalyptic figure. Schweitzer himself seems to have had second thoughts about Jesus as an apoc- alypticist. During much of his life Schweitzer focused his attention upon the sayings of Jesus—sayings of the Jewish sage—and in a later version of the pref- ace to The Quest of the Historical Jesus Schweitzer suggests that Jesus' ethical teachings may be more central to his message than the apocalyptic vision. As scholars increasingly are reasoning, if the apocalyptic vision actually comes from believers in the early church, then the supposed apocalyptic preoccupa- tions of Jesus may have been placed upon him by his biographers. Jesus may not have been a preacher of the apocalypse after all; he may have been a Jew- ish teacher of wisdom, a teller of stories, a sage. There is considerable evidence to support the interpretation of Jesus as a Jewish sage. The New Testament Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all contain a substantial amount of material reflecting Jesus' teachings and sayings. Among the first three gospels (usually termed the synoptic gospels), Matthew and Luke have more sayings and stories than Mark, and most scholars think 5. Schweitzer, The Quest of the Historical Jesus, pp. 370-71."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"36 EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS this is due to an additional written source, besides Mark, that Matthew and Luke both used. In order to make the strong, relatively silent Jesus of Mark's gospel more loquacious, most scholars deduce, Matthew and Luke must have added a collection of Jesus' sayings, now called Q (from Quelle, German for \"source\"), to the story of Jesus. 6 If this is so, then Q must antedate the Gospels of Matthew and Luke as a gospel of the wisdom of Jesus, and thus it may have originated in the middle of the first century, only a couple of decades after Jesus' death. A good case can be made that a version of another early wisdom gospel, the Gospel of Thomas, was also composed in the middle of the first century, around the time of Q, or maybe a little later. This evidence leads to the conclusion that some of the earliest Christian gospels were gospels of wisdom, presenting Jesus as a teacher of wisdom. The sayings gospel Q and the Gospel of Thomas present Jesus of Nazareth as a Jewish sage, and they may well have gotten it, in large part, historically right. As a Jewish teacher, Jesus announces the presence of the reign or kingdom of god, and he does so with aphorisms and stories (usually termed parables). Q 6:20-31 (from Luke's sermon on the plain and Matthew's sermon on the mount) illustrates how Jesus speaks in this sayings gospel: Blessings on you the poor, for the kingdom of god is yours. Blessings on you who are hungry, for you will eat well. Blessings on you who grieve, for you will be comforted. Blessings on you when they insult you and oppress you and tell all kinds of evil about you because of the human child. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. 6. On Q, see Mack, The Lost Gospel, and Robinson, Hoffman, and Kloppenborg, The Critical Edition ofQ. Since Q material is preserved in Matthew and Luke, with variations, we some- times refer to the Matthean and Lukan versions of Q. The usual means of referencing Q, also used here, employs the chapter and verse designations of Luke."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS 37 For this is how they oppressed the prophets who came before you. Love your enemies, and pray for those who oppress you, that you may be children of your father, for he makes the sun rise on the evil and the good, and makes it rain on the just and the unjust. If someone slaps you on one cheek, offer the other also. If someone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let the person have your coat also. And if someone compels you to go one mile, go with the person a second mile. Give to one who begs from you, and if someone borrows from you, do not ask for it back. And treat people the way you want people to treat you. The texts that follow in this volume, especially the Gospel of Thomas, give more examples of aphorisms of Jesus. The Gospel of Thomas also presents a number of his stories, or parables, as do other texts in this volume, especially the Secret Book of James and the Book of Thomas. Thus the sayings attributed to Jesus in Q reflect the Jewish wisdom tradi- tion. But Q also reflects the Jewish tradition of personified wisdom, Sophia, who comes to expression through the sagacity of Jesus. According to the Lukan version of Q 11:49, the wisdom (Sophia) of god utters a saying about those who are sent forth; in the Matthean version it is Jesus who says this. The two texts seem to agree that divine wisdom speaks through Jesus, but this idea is expressed in two different ways. Again, according to the Lukan version of Q 7:35, Jesus refers to wisdom (personified) being vindicated by her children (John the baptizer and Jesus), but in the Matthean version, by her deeds. Once more Jesus and wisdom, Sophia, are closely connected to one another. This re- lationship between Jesus and wisdom continues in gnostic traditions, as can be seen in other texts within the present collection, for example, the Valentin- ian texts. John the baptizer likewise continues to play a significant role in other"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"3 S EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS works included here (for example, Gospel of Thomas 46), and his place is par- ticularly prominent in Mandaean texts. THE GOSPELS OF THOMAS AND JOHN In this first part of the present book, two early gospels with wisdom orienta- tions are included: the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of John. Both pres- ent Jesus as a proclaimer of wisdom and knowledge. The Gospel of Thomas (like Q) has pithy sayings of Jesus, the Gospel of John (like many gnostic sources) offers mystical discourses of Jesus, but both stress the role of Jesus as one who discloses insight and knowledge. Although the Gospels of Thomas and John cannot be described as specifically gnostic without some qualifica- tion, both of these gospels employ themes that bring to mind gnostic motifs that are more fully developed elsewhere, and the Gospel of John was the fa- vored canonical gospel for gnostic exegesis. The Gospels of Thomas and John may thus be described as representing incipient gnostic perspectives—but they do so in very different ways. Jesus in the Gospel of Thomas utters life-giving words, promising that those who follow him, respond to his words, and find their true meaning will not taste death. Yet Thomas's Jesus is \"just Jesus,\" as Stephen Patterson puts it. 7 Thomas's Jesus does not pull rank. He does not refer to himself (and he is not referred to by others) as the Christ or the messiah, he is not acclaimed master or lord, he is not announced as the incarnate and unique son of god, and when he refers to himself as the son of man (the human child) once in the gospel (saying 86), he does so in the generic sense of referring to any person or sim- ply to himself. Further, if Thomas's Jesus is a human child, so are other people called human children in the Gospel of Thomas. Jesus in Thomas is just Jesus, but his words are not just words. They are hidden words of wisdom from a living Jesus who lives on in his sayings— hidden sayings, secret sayings, with hidden meanings. According to the Gospel of Thomas, the interpretation of these wise but hidden sayings will bring knowledge and life. Saying 2 states, \"Whoever discovers what these say- ings mean will not taste death\"; saying 3 goes on to declare, \"When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are chil- dren of the living father\"; sayings 5 and 6 affirm, \"There is nothing hidden that 7. Patterson, Bethge, and Robinson, The Fifth Gospel, p. 43."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS 39 will not be revealed.\" In its concern for hidden wisdom that is revealed and un- derstood, the Gospel of Thomas displays an interest found in other traditions, es- pecially other gnostic traditions. In the Book of Thomas and the Secret Book of James, for example, reference is also made to hidden sayings of Jesus and the interpretation of the sayings. In the Secret (or Hidden) Book of John, as else- where, the revealer indicates that questions will be answered and secrets will be revealed to the inquirers. In the Secret Book of John the secrets of wisdom in the world are said to be revealed, but this is personified wisdom, Sophia, whose story is told in mythical narrative and drama. The Secret Book of John ends with the revealer uttering a curse against anyone who betrays the mystery. The savior says, \"I have finished everything for you in your hearing. I have told you everything, for you to record and communicate secretly to your spiritual friends. For this is the mystery of the unshakable race.\" In such ways is wisdom hidden and revealed in the Gospel of Thomas and the Secret Book of John. Gospel of Thomas 50 is one of the most perplexing and perhaps one of the most gnostic of the hidden sayings of Jesus. It reflects early traditions about wisdom and the life of the soul (psyche), which must go through tran- sitions and passages of life in order to attain its proper destiny. In the present volume, the Song of the Pearl and the Exegesis on the Soul provide versions of such a myth of the soul. In gnostic texts like the Secret Book of John, some of the same motifs are used to present a gnostic account of the story of the light and enlightened people, whose origin is in the divine light, who are cre- ated in the image of the divine, and who are given movement and destined for rest in the light. The format of Gospel of Thomas 50, with questions asked and answers given, brings to mind accounts, in other sources and especially gnostic sources, of heavenly powers interrogating the soul as it passes through the spheres of heaven. Of course, many of these ideas are also reminiscent of the creation story in the opening chapters of Genesis, in this case particularly the first creation story in Genesis 1:1-2:3. And these ideas are paralleled in the poem to the divine logos at the opening of the Gospel of John. In the Gospel of John, in stark contrast to the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus is hardly \"just Jesus.\" In John, Jesus is the Christ, the messiah, the son of god and son of man. He is addressed as rabbi and is called master or lord. Here Jesus is an exalted being, one with god the father, who walks around the world, incog- nito, as god in the flesh, and who speaks in a way that sounds like the divine talking, in \"I am\" utterances. There are many of these \"I am\" declarations throughout ancient religious literature, as well as in the gnostic texts pub- lished in the present volume—see Thunder, for example. In the Gospel of"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"40 EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS John, John the baptizer, in contrast to Jesus, is nobody: he admits that he is neither the messiah nor Elijah (the prophet of the end time) nor another prophet. The author of the Gospel of John is clearly painting a polemical por- trait of John the baptizer, in order to play down the significance of a figure whose role elsewhere, as we have seen, rivals that of Jesus. Among the Man- daeans, John the baptizer is said to be the guarantor of the true ways of manda, or gnosis, and Jesus is depicted as one who perverts the law and encourages sorcery and error by departing from John and his ways. The author of the Gospel of John also appears to paint a polemical portrait of another character in his gospel account, namely, Thomas, who becomes in John's gospel the quintessential skeptic, \"doubting Thomas.\" That may be John's way of casting doubt upon the hero of the Gospel of Thomas and other texts, the twin who was responsible for safeguarding the wisdom and knowledge of Jesus. The Gospel of John, unlike the Gospel of Thomas (and the sayings gospel Q), is a narrative gospel, with a narration of the life of Jesus. John begins his gospel story with the poem to the divine logos: In the beginning was the word and the word was with god, and god was the word. The word in the beginning was with god. Through god everything was born and without the word nothing was born. What was born through the word was life and the life was the light of all people and the light in the darkness shone and the darkness could not apprehend the light. (1:1-5) All this echoes what is said of divine wisdom in Proverbs 8 and other texts (see above), but here the Johannine poem serves as a preamble to the story of Jesus. That story proceeds with miracles, called \"signs\" (Greek, semeia) in John, such as Jesus' changing water to wine at Cana. 8 The signs, like the say- ings, have hidden meanings: Jesus explains this and other signs to Nikodemos (Nicodemus) in a long, rambling discourse that is characteristic of the Gospel of John—and some other gnostic texts. In his discourse Jesus distinguishes 8. This is originally the famous miracle of Dionysos, the Greek god of wine, whose power comes to expression in the transformation of water into wine."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS 41 between what is of flesh—like the water and the wine—and what is of spirit, what is earthly and what is heavenly: If I tell you of earthly things and you do not believe, how if I tell you of heavenly things will you believe? (3:12) The real meaning of the signs, then, must be on the side of the spiritual and the heavenly. Later Jesus clarifies the meaning of water being changed into wine. The person of Jesus himself is the real, spiritual point of the sign, and Jesus says, with divine nuances, I am the true vine and my father is the gardener. I am the vine, you the branches. You who dwell in me as I in you bear much fruit, but without me you can do nothing. (15:1, 5) According to John, then, Jesus the divine word in flesh discloses god: The word became flesh and lived among us. And we gazed on his glory, the glory of the only son of the father, who is filled with grace and truth. (1:14) Jesus in John is a revealer who reveals what god's presence and glory mean: No one has ever seen god. Only the one born of god, who is in the heart of the father, has made him known. (1:18) The story of Jesus in the Gospel of John culminates with the account of the crucifixion and the resurrection appearances of Jesus. This conclusion to the story of Jesus is somewhat like that of the synoptic gospels, which focus spe- cial attention on the death and resurrection of Jesus. This sort of conclusion is also similar to the proclamation of the messenger (or apostle) Paul, who maintains that the message of the cross and resurrection is central to the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"42 EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS Christian gospel. In 1 Corinthians Paul argues this point with vigor, and he does so in opposition to the Corinthian Christians, who champion wisdom and a gospel of wisdom; these wisdom Christians may even have used something like Gospel of Thomas 17 (see below, with the note). The Gospel of John, then, like the synoptic gospels and Paul, is quite unlike the sayings gospel Q and the Gospel of Thomas, which show little or no interest in the crucifixion of Jesus. 9 John's account of the crucifixion of Jesus puts his own theological spin on the story. In the high priestly prayer in John 17 (which is neither high priestly nor a prayer, but instead a commentary on the crucifixion story), Jesus an- nounces that the hour or time has come—the hour or time of his death. The hour of death, however, is not to be an hour of darkness, as in the synoptics, where darkness overshadows the crucifixion of Jesus. Rather, it is an hour of glory and of light. As Jesus says to god, Father, the hour has come. Glorify your son so that your son may glorify you. I glorified you on earth by completing the work you gave me to do. And now glorify me, father, with yourself, with the glory I had with you before the world was. (17:1, 4-5) The scandal and the sting of the crucifixion are nearly gone in the Gospel of John. Jesus' death is glory, a homecoming, a return to god's heavenly pres- ence above. The light that had fallen, like a shooting star, into the world of darkness, may now return back to god and the fullness (Greek pleroma, as in John 1:16) of light above. It is a story reminiscent of the personified wisdom, Hokhmah, Sophia. We shall see this story told about a variety of gnostic re- vealers and saviors, including Jesus, in the gnostic sacred literature included in this volume. 9. On the crucifixion of Jesus in gnostic sources, see particularly the Letter of Peter to Philip, the Gospel of Truth, the Gospel of Philip, the Secret Book of James, the Round Dance of the Cross, and the Second Treatise of the Great Seth; on the resurrection in gnostic sources, see particularly the Treatise on Resurrection."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"1 The Gospel of Thomas I he Gospel of Thomas is a wisdom gospel. Like the sayings gospel I Q, which most scholars now suggest was a source used in compil- JL. ing the gospels of Matthew and Luke, the Gospel of Thomas por- trays Jesus as one who disseminates life-giving wisdom through his sayings. Unlike the New Testament gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and other, non-canonical gospels, the Gospel of Thomas contains almost no nar- rative. Jesus in Thomas performs no physical miracles, reveals no fulfillment of prophecy, announces no apocalyptic kingdom about to disrupt the world order, dies for no one's sins, and does not rise from the dead on Easter Sunday. His value, rather, lies in his enigmatic sayings, which are pregnant with possi- bility and power. \"Whoever discovers what these sayings mean will not taste death,\" Jesus promises. That is to say, one who uncovers the interpretive keys to the meaning of these sayings thinks Jesus' thoughts after him and completes his sayings in new and sagacious ways. Such a one seeks and finds true wisdom and knowledge.

Some sayings may well derive ultimately from the historical Jesus. The Gospel of Thomas has attracted a great deal of popular interest and was portrayed as a significant and suppressed collection of sayings of Jesus in the film Stigmata. The numbering of the sayings employed here (1-114) is a scholarly con- vention.

The Book of Thomas has a similar opening, and the Secret Book of James also calls itself a \"secret book.\" Yeshua is Jesus (here and throughout), and Yehuda Toma is Judas Thomas.

Like the JL. other New Testament gospels, the Gospel of John is a narrative gospel that offers a portrait of Jesus, whose life concludes with his crucifixion and resurrection from the dead. Yet this gospel differs remarkably in detail and message from the other, synoptic New Testament gospels. Jesus, according to John, is an exalted being who is the incarnate son of god and is one with god. Jesus is the divine word or reason of god, the logos, who descends like a falling star from heaven, becomes flesh, and makes his home in this mortal realm below. As the word of god in human flesh, Jesus performs mighty deeds, called \"signs\" in John, which demonstrate his power and great- ness. These signs most likely come from an earlier source, a gospel of signs, which meant to highlight the miracles of Jesus. In the Gospel of John these signs are interpreted in a more spiritual manner, as becomes clear in the story of Nicodemus. The signs also become the occasion for Jesus to utter long, mys- tical discourses in which he declares that he himself provides the real meaning for the signs. Thus Jesus in the Gospel of John commonly speaks in \"I am\" self- declarations, a form of speech reminiscent of the divine \"I am\" of Jewish tradi- tion and of divine speech in general (note also the use of \"I am\" statements in gnostic texts, for example, Thunder). Finally, Jesus is glorified in his death and returns to the realm above to prepare a place for those who are to follow him. These features of the portrait of Jesus in the Gospel of John are reminis- cent of themes found in a number of gnostic sources. It is no wonder, then, that John is sometimes linked to gnostic religion, or that in its present form"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS 71 the Secret Book of John is also attributed to John, or that the Valentinian Her- akleon composed a commentary on the Gospel of John, or that the Acts of John contains a Round Dance of the Cross with gnostic features, or that the Cathar Gospel of the Secret Supper is said to be narrated by John. Nor is it surprising that some scholars understand the Gospel of John to be a gnosti- cizing gospel or a gospel written within the context of gnostic themes. The Gospel of John was composed in Greek, probably near the end of the first century. The references to followers of Jesus being evicted from the syna- gogue would suggest a date during the last decade or two of the first century. Like the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of John may also have been written somewhere in Syria. However, Thomas, the authoritative figure of the Gospel of Thomas, is subjected to a much more negative evaluation in the Gospel of John, where he is made to assume the infamous role of \"doubting Thomas.\" The translation given here presents three excerpts from the Gospel of John, chapters 1-3,11-12, and 17-21. These excerpts are crucial for understand- ing how the author of the gospel portrays Jesus and what gnostics found attractive about that portrayal. This translation, like that of the Gospel of Thomas, gives Semitic forms of Semitic names, in order to emphasize the Jew- ish identity of Jesus and his students and the Jewish context of the life of Jesus. Thus the name Yeshua is used for Jesus and Yohanan for John. For an identifi- cation of other names, see the notes. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN' (Chapter 1) IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD In the beginning was the word 2 and the word was with god, 1. The Gospel of John: translated by Willis Barnstone from the Greek text of the New Testament. 2. The word (Greek logos), sometimes capitalized as \"the Word,\" is immediately personified as \"he.\" See parallel in Genesis 1:1. John 1:1-18 is a prologue and is often held to be a separate poem adapted for the gospel. Logos may be given multiple meanings: the word of god, the Greek principle of reason ordering the universe, and a kabbalistic principle of the primacy of creating words and letters of words, before god could speak the universe into being."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"72 EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS and the word was god.

Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.\" \"Are you the prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" \"Who are you? Give us an answer for those who sent us here.

They questioned him and said to him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Galilean or Elijah or the prophet?\" He answered them, \"I baptize in water. Among you stands one you do not know, one who will come after me, whose sandal strap I am unworthy to loosen.\" All this happened in Bethany across the Jordan, where Yohanan was baptizing. 10. All the people in these scenes are Jews. The appellation \"Jew\" here and in most places in John has two functions: to distinguish Jews who do not believe Jesus to be the son of god from those who do, and to cast hatred on and condemn the unbelievers to immediate and eternal punishment. The followers of Jesus were initially few in number among the many sects that made up the Jewish population. All thought themselves Jews, whether traditional Jews or Christian Jews. Therefore, naming the Jews as a hated community existing alongside Jesus and his followers almost certainly reflects the later, competitive period of nascent Christianity, when the Jews had expelled Christian Jews from the synagogues and when the traditional Jews, in turn, became the vilified enemy. 11.

What is born from the flesh is flesh, what is born from the wind is wind. Do not wonder that I told you you must be born again from above.

If I tell you of earthly things and you do not believe, how if I tell you of heavenly things will you believe? And no one has gone up into the sky except the one who came down from the sky, the earthly son. And as Moshe raised up the snake in the desert, the earthly son must be raised up so that all who believe in him will have eternal life. \"God loved the world so much that he gave his only son, so that all who believe in him might not be destroyed but have eternal life. For god did not send his son into the world to judge the world but so that through him the world might be saved. One who believes in him is not judged, but one who does not believe is judged already for not believing in the name of god's only son. And this is the judgment: that the light came into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were cunning. For all who do paltry things 32 hate the light and do not come toward the light so that their works will not be exposed. But those who do the truth come toward the light so that their works may shine as accomplished through god.\" 33 32. The Greek means \"slight\" or \"paltry\" rather than \"evil\" or \"wrong.\" 33.

The grumbling about the money wasted on anointing Jesus that might have gone to the poor is voiced by unnamed diners, not Judas. In Luke the scene is more erotic, there is also a Simon, the speech about the poor is almost the same, and Judas is not mentioned. 44.

Look, your king is coming, sitting on a foal of a donkey.\" 45 His students did not understand these things at first, but when Yeshua was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and these things had been done for him. The crowd that was with him when he raised Eleazar from the tomb bore witness to it all. That was why the crowd went to meet him, for they heard that he had performed the miraculous sign. So the Pharisees said to one another, \"You see, you can do nothing. Look, the world has gone over to him.\" YESHUA FORETELLS HIS DEATH Now, there were some Greek Jews 46 among those who went up to worship at the feast. They came to Philippos from Bethsaida of Galil and asked him, say- ing, \"Sir, we wish to see Yeshua.\" Philippos came and told Andreas. Andreas and Philippos came and told Yeshua. And Yeshua answered them, saying, \"The hour has come when the earthly son is glorified. 47 Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falling into the earth dies, it remains alone. But if it dies it brings forth a great harvest. 48 \"Whoever loves life will lose it, and whoever hates life in this world will keep it for life everlasting. \"Let anyone who serves me, follow me, and where I am, there also will be my servant. Whoever serves me, the father will honor. 45.Zechariah9:9. 46. Ethnic Greeks who had converted to Judaism. 47.

They said, \"It has thundered.\" Others said, \"An angel has spoken to him.\" Yeshua answered and said, \"Not because of me has this voice come but because of you. Now is the judgment of the world, now the ruler of this world will be cast out. And if I am raised above the earth I will draw everyone to me.\" This he said, signifying what kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, \"We heard from the law that the messiah re- mains forever. How can you say the earthly son must be raised? Who is this earthly son?\" Yeshua said to them, \"For a little time longer the light is with you. Walk while you still have the light so that the darkness may not overtake you. And the one walking in the darkness does not know where he is going. While you have light, believe in the light so you may be the children of light.\" OF THE UNBELIEVERS Yeshua said this and went away and went into hiding from them. Though he had performed so many miraculous signs before them, they did not believe in him so that the word spoken by Isaiah will be fulfilled: \"Lord, who has believed in our message?"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS 8 9 And to whom was the arm of the lord revealed?\" 49 This is why they could not believe, because since Isaiah said elsewhere, \"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart so that they might not see with their eyes and understand with their heart and turn their mind around so that I might heal them.\" 50 Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and he spoke about him. Still, even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Phar- isees they did not admit it so that they would not be put out of the synagogue. They loved human glory more than the glory of god. But Yeshua cried out and said, \"Who believes in me does not believe in me but in the one who sent me. As light into the world I have come so that who believes in me not reside in darkness. And who hears my words and does not keep them I do not judge, for I have come not to judge the world but to save the world. \"Who rejects me and will not receive my words has a judge waiting. The word I spoke will judge him on the last day. Because I spoke not from myself but from the one who sent me, the father has given me his commandment, what I should say and how I should speak.

Now, Yehuda, who betrayed him, also knew the place, since Yeshua often met there with his students. Then Yehuda got a band of soldiers and serving men of the high priests and Pharisees, and went there with lamps and torches and weapons. Yeshua, who knew everything that was to happen to him, went out and said to them, \"Who are you looking for?\" They answered him, \"Yeshua the Nazarene.\" He said to them, \"I am he.\" And they stepped backward and fell to the ground. So again he answered them, \"I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.\" 54.

The slave's name was Malchos. But Yeshua said to Kefa, \"Put your knife back in its sheath. Shall I not drink the cup the father gave me?\" Then the guard and the commander and servants of the Jews took Yeshua and bound him. And first they led him to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Ca- iaphas, the high priest for that year. Now, it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it is better for one man to die for the people. KEFA DISOWNS YESHUA Shimon Kefa and another student followed Yeshua. And that student, who was known to the high priest, went with Yeshua into the high priest's court. But Kefa stayed outside the door. So the other student, an acquaintance of the high priest, spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Kefa inside. Then the girl who was at the door said to Kefa, \"Aren't you one of that man's students?\" He said, \"I am not.\" Now, the slaves and assistants stood around a charcoal fire they had made, since it was cold and they were warming themselves. Kefa also was standing there with them, keeping warm. Then the high priest questioned Yeshua about his students and about his teaching. Yeshua replied to him, \"I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple where all the Jews gather. And in secret I spoke nothing. Why question me? Ask those who heard what I said to them. Look, they know what I said.\" When he said this, one of the serving men slapped Yeshua and said, \"Is that how you answer the high priest?\" Yeshua answered him,"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"94 EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS \"If I spoke wrong, testify to the wrong.

YESHUAGOES BEFORE PILATUS They led Yeshua from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. 55 It was early morning. They didn't enter the Praetorium, so as to avoid defilement that might prevent them from eating the Pesach meals. So Pilatus 56 emerged and said to them, \"What charge do you bring against this man?\" They answered him and said, \"Unless he were doing wrong, we would not have turned him over to you.\" Pilatus said to them, \"Take him and judge him according to your law.\" Then the Jews said to him, \"It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.\" This happened to fulfill Yeshua's word when he foretold what kind of death he was to die. 57 Then Pilatus again went into the Praetorium and called Yeshua and said to him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" Yeshua answered, \"Are you speaking for yourself or did others tell you about me?\" \"Am I a Jew?\" Pilatus answered. \"Your people and the high priest handed you over to me. What did you do?\" 58 55. Governor's house. 56. Pilate. 57. This sentence, a commentary and interpretation interrupting the narration, may be a scribal interpolation and is usually placed in parentheses or brackets. 58. Pilate's essential question, \"What did you do?,\" would suggest that Pilate was unaware of wrongdoing. Among historians there is a large consensus that Rome executed Jesus as a sedi- tionist, as one opposed to Roman occupation. Without historical evidence, Pilate's question is not plausible. Its consequence is to accuse Jews of initiating Jesus' execution and to emphasize Rome's unwilling and marginal involvement in it."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS 95 Yeshua responded, \"My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my servants would have fought to keep me from being delivered to the Jews. 59 But now my kingdom is not here.\" Then Pilatus said to him, \"Then you are a king?\" Yeshua answered, \"You say I am a king. For this I was born and for this I came into the world that I might testify to the truth. Everyone born of truth hears my voice.\" Pilatus said to him, \"What is truth?\" And after he said this, again he went out to the Jews and told them, \"I find no fault in him. But you have this custom that I should release someone to you at Pesach. So do you want me to release the king of the Jews?\" They shouted back saying, \"Not this man but Barabbas.\" Now, Barabbas was a robber. (Chapter 19) PILATUS YIELDS TO THE JEWS AND ORDERS CRUCIFIXION Then Pilatus took Yeshua and flogged him. And the soldiers wove a wreath out of thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe around him. And they went up to him and said, \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" And they struck him in the face. And Pilatus again went outside and said to them, \"Look, I am bringing him out to you so you may know that I find no fault in him.\" Then Yeshua came out, wearing the wreath of thorns and the purple robe. 59.

I find no fault in him.\" The Jews answered him, \"We have a law and according to that law he should die, because he made himself son of god.\" When Pilatus heard this word, he was more frightened. Again he went back into the Praetorium and said to Yeshua, \"Where are you from?\" But Yeshua didn't answer him. Then Pilatus told him, \"You don't speak to me? Don't you know that I have the authority to free you and I have the authority to crucify you?\" Yeshua answered him, \"You would have no authority over me at all were it not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.\" 60 Thereupon Pilatus sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, \"If you free this man, you are not a friend of Caesar! Everyone who makes him- self a king defies Caesar.\" When Pilatus heard these words, he led Yeshua outside and sat on the judg- ment seat called Stone Pavement, but in Hebrew Gabbatha. Now, it was Friday, the Preparation Day for Pesach, the sixth hour, which is noon. He said to the Jews, \"Look, here is your king.\" Then they shouted, \"Take him away, take him away and crucify him!\" Pilatus said to them, \"Shall I crucify your king?\" The high priest answered, \"We have no king but Caesar.\" So he gave him to them to be crucified. 61 60. Jesus fully exonerates Pilate, who is acting not through his authority or free will, but by the authority given to him from the father. The Jews, however, have acted freely and therefore their sin is greater. 61. Robert J. Miller, in The Complete Gospels, offers the following comment: \"The resulting im- plication that all the Jews/Judeans, or perhaps only some Jewish officials, crucified Jesus—as Pilate had suggested (v. 6)—is wholly inaccurate. In historical fact, whatever Pilate's view of Jesus' guilt, it was certainly he who saw to the execution (see v. 19); crucifixion was never prac- ticed by Jews. The monstrous unreality of this half-verse, if it reads as intended, must be en- tirely a function of theological or political polemic\" (p. 240)."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS 97 YESHUA IS CRUCIFIED They took Yeshua. Carrying the cross himself, he went to what was called the Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is Golgotha, where they crucified him and two others, one on either side with Yeshua in the middle. Pilatus wrote a placard and put it on the cross. It read, YESHUA THE NAZARENE THE KING OF THE JEWS. Many Jews read the placard because the place where Yeshua was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. So the high priests of the Jews said to Pilatus, \"Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but write what he said: 'I am king of the Jews.'\" Pilatus answered, \"What I've written, I've written.\" When the soldiers crucified Yeshua, they took his clothes and divided them in four parts, one part for each soldier. And they took his tunic too. Now, his tunic shirt was seamless, woven in one piece from the top straight down. So they said to each other, \"Let's not tear it, but casts lots for it to see whose it will be. This was to fulfill the words of the scripture, saying, \"They divided my clothes among them and for my clothes they cast lots.\" 62 That is what the soldiers did. But near the cross of Yeshua stood his mother and his mother's sister Miryam of Klopas and Miryam of Magdala. 63 Then Yeshua, seeing his mother and the student he loved standing near, said to his mother, \"Woman, here is your son.\" 64 Then he said to the student, \"Here is your mother.\" And from that hour the student took her into his own. 65 62. Psalm 22:18. 63. Mary Magdalene. 64. Literally, \"Woman, look, your son,\" which is followed by \"Look, your mother.\" In the synop- tic gospels, Mary, Jesus' mother, does not appear. Here she appears briefly, but her name goes unmentioned. The other Marys appear by name. 65. Although \"home\" or \"care\" may be the implied translation, it says no more than \"He took her into his own.\""},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"98 EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS After this Yeshua, knowing that all had been done to fulfill the words of the scripture, said, \"I am thirsty.\" 66 A jar filled with vinegar 67 was lying there. So they put a sponge soaked with the vinegar on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth. Then when Yeshua had taken the wine, he said, \"It is ended.\" And bowing his head, he gave up his spirit. 68 THE FATE OF YESHUA'S BODY Since it was Friday the Preparation Day, the Jews asked Pilatus that their legs be broken and they be taken away so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on Shabbat. 69 The soldiers came and broke the bones of the first man and then of the other one crucified with him. But when they came to Yeshua and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers stabbed his side with his spear, and at once blood and water came out. And the one who saw this has testified to it, and the testimony is true, and he knows he is speaking the truth so that you may also believe. 70 These things happened to fulfill the scripture, \"No bone of his will be bro- ken.\" 71 And elsewhere it says, \"They will look at him whom they stabbed.\" 72 After these things Yosef of Arimathea, 73 being a student of Yeshua, but a se- cret one for fear of the Jews, asked Pilatus if he could take away Yeshua's body. Pilatus allowed it. Then he came and took the body. Nikodemos came too, the one who first came to him during the night, and he brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. So they took the body of Yeshua and wrapped it in aromatic spices in linen cloths, as is the burial custom of the Jews. 66. Psalm 22:15. 67. This could mean a cheap, sour wine. 68.

So because it was the Friday the Preparation Day of the Jews, and the tomb was near, in it they placed Yeshua. (Chapter 20) YESHUA APPEARS TO MIRYAM OF MAGDALA On Sunday the first day of the week, Miryam of Magdala came to the tomb early while it was still dark and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb. So she ran and came to Shimon Kefa and to the other student whom Yeshua loved and said to them, \"They took the lord from the tomb and we don't know where they put him.\" Then Kefa and the other student came out and went to the tomb. The two ran together, but the student ran faster than Kefa and reached the tomb first. And he stooped down and saw the linen cloths lying there, but didn't go in. Then Shimon Kefa came, following him, and he went into the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there, but the kerchief which had been on his head was lying not next to the cloths but apart and folded up in its own place. And then the other student, who had come first to the tomb, saw and believed. They didn't yet know the scripture that he must rise from the dead. 74 Then the students went off to their own places. But Miryam stood by the tomb, weeping. Then as she was weeping, she stooped and looked into the tomb and saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Yeshua was laid. And they said to her, \"Woman, why are you weeping?\" She said to them, \"They have taken my lord away and I don't know where they put him.\" 74. There is a resurrection of the dead in Isaiah 26:19 and Daniel 12:2.

Yeshua said to her, \"Do not hold on to me, since I have not yet gone up to the father. But go to my brothers and tell them, I am ascending to my father and your father and my god and your god.\" Miryam of Magdala went and announced to the students, \"I have seen the lord.\" And she told them that he had said these things to her. YESHUA APPEARS TO THE STUDENTS So when it was early evening of that first day of the week and the doors of the house where the students met were locked for fear of the Jews, Yeshua came and stood in their midst and said to them, \"Peace to you.\" And saying this, he showed his hands and his side to them.

So the other students were saying to him, \"We have seen the lord.\" But he said to them, \"Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands and I put my finger into the place of the nails and I put my hand into his side, I shall not believe.\" After eight days the students were again in the house and Toma with them. Though the doors were shut, Yeshua stood in their midst and said, \"Peace to you.\" Then he said to Toma, \"Bring your fingers here and see my hands, and bring your hand and put it in my side, and do not be without faith but of faith.\" Toma answered, saying to him, \"My lord and my god.\" 76 Yeshua said to him, \"Do you believe because you have seen me? Blessings on those who have not seen and believe.\" Yeshua performed many other signs before his students, which have not been written in this book. But these things were written that you may believe that Yeshua is the messiah the son of god, and that in believing you may have life in his name. 77 75. This is John's version of the sending of the spirit to the church; see also the Pentecost ac- count in Acts 2:1-41. 76.

And this is how he showed himself. Gathered together were Shimon Kefa and Toma called the twin and Nathanael from Kana in Galil and the sons of Zebedee and two other students. Shimon Kefa said, \"I'm going fishing.\" They told him, \"We're coming with you.\" They went out and got into the boat, and all that night caught nothing. At daybreak Yeshua was standing on the beach. But the students didn't re- alize that it was Yeshua. Yeshua said to them, \"Children, have you any fish?\" \"No,\" they answered him. And he said to them, \"Cast the net in the waters to the right side of the ship and you will find some.\" So they cast, and they weren't strong enough to haul it back in because of the swarm of fish. Then that student whom Yeshua loved 78 said to Kefa, \"It is the lord.\" When Shimon Kefa heard it was the lord, he put on his outer garment, for he had stripped naked and thrown himself into the sea. But the other students came in a small boat—they were not far from the land, about a hundred yards away—dragging the net full of fish. When they came out on the shore, they saw a charcoal fire and a small fish placed on it, and bread. Yeshua said to them, \"Now bring some of the fish you caught.\" 78. Apparently the unknown student, who ran faster to the empty tomb than Peter and be- lieved what he saw. When fishing, the beloved student, not Peter, recognized Jesus on the shore. In the same supplement, however, Peter appears to be elevated to leadership by virtue of his foretold crucifixion in service of the church."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"EARLY WISDOM GOSPELS 103 So Shimon Kefa went on board and dragged the net onto the land, filled with big fish, a hundred fifty-three of them, yet with so many the net didn't tear. Yeshua said to them, \"Come have breakfast.\" None of the students dared ask, \"Who are you?\" knowing that it was the lord. Yeshua came and took the bread and gave it to them, and also the fish. This was already the third time that Yeshua appeared to the students after he was raised from the dead. YESHUA QUESTIONS SHIMON KEFA'S LOVE So when they had breakfasted, Yeshua said to Shimon Kefa, \"Shimon son of Yohanan, do you love me more than they do?\" Shimon said to him, \"Yes, lord, you know that I love you.\" Yeshua said to him, \"Feed my lambs.\" He asked Shimon a second time, \"Shimon son of Yohanan, do you love me?\" Shimon said, \"Yes, lord, you know that I love you.\" He said to Shimon son of Yohanan for the third time, \"Do you love me?\" Kefa was hurt that he had asked him for the third time, \"Do you love me?\" And he said to him, \"Lord, you know all things, you know that I love you.\" 79 Yeshua replies, \"Graze my sheep.\" YESHUA FORETELLS SHIMON KEFA'S DEATH And he said to him, \"Truly, truly I say to you, when you were younger, you fastened your own belt and walked about where you wished. 79.

Follow me.\" So word went out to the brothers that the student would not die. But Yeshua did not tell Kefa that the student would not die, but rather, \"If I want him to stay until I come, what is that to you?\" This is the student who testifies to these things and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true. And there are many other things that Yeshua did. If they were written down one by one, I think the world itself would not have room to hold the books that would be written. 80.

The selection presented here consists of twenty-nine texts, some consid- ered classics of gnostic spirituality, that represent varieties of gnostic religions in the Mediterranean region during the early centuries of the common era. Of the many texts that might have been included in this part of the volume, we have selected texts that are not only representative of major options in gnostic spirituality but also well preserved and attractive as literature. These texts il- lustrate early gnostic, Sethian, Valentinian, Syrian, and other varieties of gnos- tic religions, yet there are points of similarity and connection among them. All of the texts are concerned with wisdom and knowledge; many of them trace the fortunes (and misfortunes) of wisdom—personified as Hokhmah or Sophia—in the context of gnostic themes. Here, as in the wisdom literature discussed above, the figure of wisdom remains a focal point of attention, but now wisdom is radicalized, and reflects the very nature of gnosticism by em- bracing the tragedy and hope of the human experience. In these texts wisdom creates and reveals, falls and is restored, saves and is saved. And with divine wisdom, these texts proclaim, fallen human beings too are saved and restored. THE BOOK OF BARUCH The church fathers and heresiologists describe, in polemical terms, a number of figures whom they consider to be early gnostic teachers: Simon Magus, a first-century teacher from Samaria; Dositheos and Menander, also from Samaria; Cerinthos, Carpocrates, Saturnilus, Marcellina, and a few others. About these figures we know only what the heresiologists choose to tell us, and they choose to tell us little more than that these teachers proclaimed error and impiety."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"io 8 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM About the writings of the gnostic teacher Justin, however, we know some- what more, thanks to Hippolytus of Rome. In his Refutation of All Heresies, Hippolytus cites and paraphrases a gnostic text composed by Justin, the Book of Baruch, although Hippolytus says it is the most abominable book he has read. From Hippolytus's citations we learn enough to reconstruct large frag- ments of Justin and his book. Kurt Rudolph describes the Book of Baruch as \"one of the most original and probably also the oldest testimonies of Gnosis.\" * Strongly Jewish in its perspective, the book seems to propose a gnostic system that is one of the earliest representations of gnosis. Robert Grant calls it \"an ex- ample of a gnosis that is almost purely Jewish,\" 2 though in its present form, the book also incorporates references to Greco-Roman deities, as well as to Jesus. The Book of Baruch presents a gnostic system with three principles, two that are male and one that is female. The most exalted manifestation of the di- vine is called the Good, a male power; he is also called Priapos, the Greco- Roman ithyphallic fertility god. The other powers take their names from Hebrew tradition, the male Elohim from the Hebrew word for \"god\" and the female Edem from the Hebrew for \"earth.\" 3 The female principle Edem is reminiscent of wisdom, Sophia, and she has many characteristics in the Book of Baruch: she is earth; garden; Israel; creator of humans, beasts, and the soul; and a symbol of Eve, who is her creation and double. The story of Baruch is a tale of the love of Elohim and Edem, heaven and earth, love that is expressed and is lost, with the author, Justin, employing themes from Genesis to tell his gnostic story of the fate of humanity and the emergence of evil in the world. Elohim, the heavenly father god and the cre- ator of the world, is the lover of Edem, the earthly mother goddess. From their impassioned sexual union come twenty-four angelic children, and the angels in turn create humankind and paradise. These twenty-four angels seem to an- ticipate the more developed portrayals of the realm of the divine fullness, or pleroma, in Sethian and Valentinian gnostic systems. Elohim breathes spirit (Greek pneuma) into Adam, and Edem breathes soul (Greek psyche). Baruch (Hebrew for \"blessed\") is the good tree of life and the chief paternal angel, and Naas (from nahash, Hebrew for \"serpent\") 4 is the evil tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the chief maternal angel. i.

Instead, Elohim stays above, on high, and Edem, abandoned down below, brings all sorts of evil upon the spirit of Elohim within people. The lovers' quarrel between Elohim and Edem continues through human history. Elohim sends the angel Baruch to \"comfort the spirit living in all people.\" Baruch tries to solicit the aid of Moses, the Hebrew prophets, and even the prophet Herakles (Hercules), all in vain. Finally Elohim sends Baruch to Nazareth, and he \"found Jesus, son of Joseph and Mary, feeding sheep, a boy of twelve, and he told him everything that had happened from the beginning, from Edem and Elohim and all that will be. He said, 'All the prophets before you were seduced, but Jesus, earthly son, try not to be se- duced, and preach the word to people and tell them about the father and the Good, and ascend to the Good and sit with Elohim, father of us all.'\" The story of the Book of Baruch concludes, according to the account in Hippoly- tus, with allegorical interpretations that connect portions of the gnostic story with Greco-Roman mythology. SETHIAN LITERATURE The name Sethian denotes a body of gnostic texts and myths that give promi- nence to Seth, the third son of Adam and Eve. Because a second divine entity, often named Barbelo, the divine forethought and revealer, also figures in these texts and myths, heresiologists nicknamed the gnostics who produced them Barbeloites and Barbelognostics, designations still used by modern scholars. Bentley Layton, as we noted in the general introduction to this volume, em- phasizes that these religious figures called themselves gnostics, and he refers to their writings as \"classic gnostic scriptures.\" In the sacred texts included here, the ancient authors refer to spiritually enlightened people like themselves as \"the unshakable race of perfect humankind\" or \"the offspring (or seed) of Seth.\" Hence, for the sake of convenience we shall call these gnostics Sethians. The Sethians understood themselves to be children of Adam and Eve, through Seth. Adam and Eve were the first parents, through whom the divine 5.

Genesis hints that Seth marked a new beginning for humanity after the violence that plagued the relation- ship of the brothers Cain and Abel. In Genesis 4, Cain is described as killing his brother Abel and being banished for his act of murder; in the Secret Book of John, Cain and Abel are said to have been fathered by the seductive first ruler Yaldabaoth, who defiled Eve sexually to get her pregnant. In Genesis 4:25, in the Septuagint, Seth is said to be sperma heteron, \"another seed,\" in place of the dead Abel. The gnostics, in turn, described themselves as \"an- other race,\" the offspring or seed of Seth. Another gnostic text, part of which is presented below, is mentioned by Porphyry as a gnostic text known to his teacher Plotinos, and is entitled Allogenes, \"Foreigner,\" literally \"One from Another Race.\" The sacred literature of the Sethians features a mythological narrative that provides a reinterpretation of the opening chapters of Genesis. Several of the Sethian texts included here reflect features of this mythological narrative, but one of the most compelling of the presentations of the myth is to be found in the Secret Book of John. Although in its present form, in the versions of the Secret Book of John that have been preserved in the Nag Hammadi library and the Berlin Gnostic Codex 8502, the myth is recounted in a Christianized form, the literary evidence (more obvious in the Coptic) suggests that the myth derives from a hellenistic Jewish gnostic tradition that was in dialogue with Greek mythological and philosophical traditions, particularly Greek philosophical traditions going back to Plato. 6 This Hellenistic Jewish telling of the gnostic creation myth describes the origin, fall, and restoration of the light, the light within gnostics and the light within god. The cast of characters in the myth, some of whom are known from Genesis, appear within the Sethian texts given here. The original divine entity is the infinite One, the in- visible spirit (revealed as the transcendent One in the Secret Book of John and the Vision of the Foreigner). From the One emanates the divine forethought Barbelo, and together the One and Barbelo produce a divine child, to form an exalted triad or trinity. With the divine in the fullness or pleroma of divinity are four luminaries, Harmozel, Oroiael, Daveithai, and Eleleth, along with Geradamas (Adam the stranger) and his son Seth. Mother Sophia—herself an eternal realm connected with Eleleth—miscalculates (her motives are de- scribed in different ways), and from her mistake comes her arrogant son, the demiurge and creator of the world named Yaldabaoth, Sakla, or Samael.

Of the gnostic texts included in this volume, 7 most of the texts designated as Sethian exhibit clear Sethian affinities. Thunder is less obviously Sethian (or gnostic, for that matter), but we classify it, tentatively, as a Sethian gnostic text (with Bentley Layton), for several reasons. First is its concern for wisdom and knowledge, and its resemblance to portions of the statement of divine transcendence at the beginning of the Secret Book of John. In Thunder, the \"I am\" self-declarations, with their paradoxical formulations, reveal a female deity who comes from above to the human realm. She is called life (as Eve is called \"the mother of all living\" in Genesis 3:20), and she is wisdom and knowledge, and thus she resembles the female deities who appear in a number of roles and accomplish a number of tasks in the Secret Book of John and other Sethian texts: forethought, wisdom, life (Eve), and especially after- thought (epinoia), which is specifically mentioned in Thunder. The Letter of Peter to Philip incorporates various traditions into a text that resembles the New Testament or apocryphal Acts of the Apostles, but the rev- elation about the deficiency of divine light brought about by the fall of Sophia, though tersely presented, contains elements that bring to mind the Sophia myth of the Secret Book of John. In the Letter of Peter to Philip, like the Secret Book of John, the problem in the eternal realms stems from the mother, whose disobedience leads her to act independently of the father. She produces a child, an arrogant one, who steals power from his mother, establishes a bu- reaucracy of ignorant cosmic administrators, and collaborates in the creation of mortal human beings. This human creation is based, however, upon a mis- representation of the image of the divine that had appeared. For, in words that closely parallel Gospel of Thomas 72, the creator wished to make \"an image in place of an image and a form in place of a form\" (see also Genesis 1:26). VALENTINIAN LITERATURE One of the two great gnostic teachers of the second century whom we know by name is Valentinos. The other is Basilides, who was a contemporary of Valentinos but who is given little attention in this volume because he is known 7. Additional Sethian texts not included in this volume on account of their fragmentary charac- ter or their length include Melchizedek (Nag Hammadi Codex IX,J), the Thought of Norea (IX,2), Marsanes (X), perhaps Hypsiphrone (XI,4), and the untitled text from the Bruce Codex. Other mythological texts with some similarities to Sethian mythological texts include On the Origin of the World and the Paraphrase of Shem, both presented below."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"112 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM only through fragments preserved in and discussions included in the heresiol- ogists. Suffice it to say that Basilides was a successful early second-century gnostic teacher in the cosmopolitan city of Alexandria, Egypt, and Valentinos must have known of his teachings while he was there. Another well-known teacher of the second century is Marcion, whom we discussed briefly in the general introduction to this volume. On account of his theological dualism, with its critical stance toward the Jewish god, the Hebrew Bible, and the world in general, Marcion sometimes is called a gnostic, though we do not under- stand him to be an advocate of a religion of gnosis, as we noted above. Valentinos was an Egyptian born in the Nile delta around the beginning of the second century. A convert to Christianity, Valentinos was educated in Alexandria, and he learned about Greek philosophy, Christian thinking (most likely including that of Basilides), and hellenistic Jewish methods of reading and interpreting the scriptures. He also seems to have been influenced by the Sethian gnostics of his time. Bentley Layton supports this by citing Irenaeus's observation: \"Valentinos adapted the fundamental principles of the so-called gnostic school of thought [Layton's classic gnostics] to his own kind of sys- tem.\" 8 Valentinos went on to Rome, where he was caught up in theological and ecclesiastical affairs in the Christian community there. The heresiologist Tertullian maintained that Valentinos hoped to become bishop of Rome—or, we might say, his century's equivalent of the pope. Valentinos proved to be a brilliant teacher, and among his followers several continued his gnostic thought in their own literary works. This volume contains the best of their ef- forts. Of Valentinos's own writings little survives. Among the Valentinian texts presented here only the mystical meditation entitled the Gospel of Truth may have been composed by Valentinos himself. 9 Of the other literary works of Valentinos, a fragment of a poem, \"Summer Harvest,\" survives in the writings of the heresiologist Hippolytus: Through spirit I see that all are suspended, through spirit I know that all are conveyed, flesh suspended from soul, soul depending on air, air suspended from atmosphere. 8. Irenaeus, Against Heresies 1.11.1. 9- Kurt Rudolph, incidentally, disagrees with this suggestion {Gnosis, 319)."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM 113 From the depth come crops, from the womb comes a child. 10 Valentinian thought, as intimated in the poetic fragment from Valentinos, is based upon bythos or bathos, divine depth. In the words of the Gospel of Truth, the person of knowledge, the gnostic revealer, \"has turned many from error. He went before them to their own places, from which they departed when they erred because of the depth of him who surrounds every place, whereas there is nothing which surrounds him.\" Again, later in the Gospel of Truth, \"This is the perfection in the thought of the father and these are the words of his reflection. Each one of his words is the work of his will alone, in the revelation of his word. Since they were in the depth of his mind, the word, who was the first to come forth, caused them to appear, along with an intellect which speaks the unique word by means of a silent grace.\" From depth emanates the pleroma of divinity, organized as (at least) fif- teen pairs of beings, or couples, for a total of (at least) thirty eternal realms (aeons). All are suspended, all are held in the fullness of the divine, as the poem of Valentinos shows. While different names are assigned to the eternal realms in the different versions of the Valentinian scheme of things, the first two groups of four (tetrads) are most prominent. The resultant realm of eight (ogdoad), according to Irenaeus, looks like this: depth  and thought (ennoia) or grace or silence mind (nous)  and truth or only child (monogenes) word (logos)  and life (zoe) human being  and church A number of these eternal realms resemble the eternal realms in the Secret Book of John and other Sethian texts, as does Sophia, the last of the Valentin- ian eternal realms.

Christ helps restore Sophia to the pleroma, but her desire is expelled outside the pleroma, and it becomes another Sophia, a lower wisdom called Achamoth (a name that resembles Hokhmah, the Hebrew word for \"wisdom\"—see the Gospel of Philip). Jesus the savior in turn is brought forth to heal Achamoth through knowledge, but her passions are also set aside, destined to be elements used for the creation of the cosmos. In Valentinian thought the mythic drama thus takes place at two levels, above and below, and the integrity of the divine fullness itself is protected by means of a limit or boundary (hows) —hence the need for Sophia above and Achamoth below, and Christ above and Jesus below. A mythic drama that takes place above and below also may be observed in the Secret Book of John and other Sethian texts, with forethought above and afterthought below, Geradamas above and Adam below, and heavenly Seth above and earthly Seth, and the Sethian gnostics, below. From these experi- ences of wisdom in Valentinian thought come three sorts of elemental stuff that characterize life, including human life, in the world: the material, the psychical, and the spiritual. Human beings, then, are divided into three groups in Valentinian thought: hylics—material people of flesh and blood who are unbelievers; psychics—psychical people, people with soul, who are ordinary Christians; and pneumatics—truly spiritual people, people with di- vine spirit, who are gnostics. These last are the Valentinians themselves. All in all, Valentinian thought shows a complexity in its gnostic scheme that builds upon previous gnostic reflections, especially Sethian reflections, and in- corporates Greek philosophical observations, especially platonic observations. There is variety in Valentinian expression—for example, scholars sometimes distinguish between a Western or Italic branch and an eastern branch—and there is subtlety and insight in the theological and exegetical formulations of Valentinian teachers. While most of the texts included here are unquestionably Valentinian, the Secret Book of James and the Round Dance of the Cross are much less cer- tainly so, as explained in the introductions to those texts. 11 11. Other Valentinian texts and fragments of texts are also known, including fragments and dis- cussions in the heresiologists, Excerpts of Theodotus, the Tripartite Tractate (Nag Hammadi Codex 1,5), the Interpretation of Knowledge (XI,i), and a Valentinian Exposition (XI,2). The Testimony of Truth (IXj) also has echoes as well as criticism of Valentinian thought and prac- tice. Birger Pearson suggests the possibility that Julius Cassianus may have been the author of this text."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM 115 THOMAS AND OTHER SYRIAN LITERATURE In addition to the Gospel of Thomas, which is included in Part One of this vol- ume, three additional texts representing the tradition of Syrian spirituality in general and (in two instances, at least) Judas Thomas in particular are included in this part of the volume: the Songs of Solomon, the Song of the Pearl, and the Book of Thomas. None of these texts is unequivocally gnostic, but all proclaim a mystical wisdom and knowledge that illustrate the religious milieu of Syria and northern Mesopotamia during the early centuries of the common era. These texts also are documents that had a considerable influence on the devel- opment of religions, including gnostic religions. The great New Testament scholar Rudolf Bultmann used the Songs (or Odes) of Solomon to show what he considered to be the background of another document from Syria, the Gospel of John. Likewise, Thomas literature was known throughout the region and also in Egypt, and Thomas literature, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, appears to have shaped the thinking of Valentinian and Manichaean gnostics. The Songs of Solomon comprise a hymnbook of poetic and mystical beauty. Scholars disagree about whether these songs originally functioned as a Jewish, Christian (or Jewish Christian), or gnostic hymnbook, but whatever might be the case, these poems are permeated with a profound concern for mystical wisdom and knowledge. Portions of the songs are excerpted in the gnostic text Pistis Sophia. Selections from Song 8 may show the mystical con- cerns of the Songs of Solomon: Hear the word of truth and drink the knowledge that I offer from my station. Your flesh cannot know what I say to you, nor your robes what I show you. Keep my mystery. It harbors you. Keep my faith. It harbors you. Know my knowledge, you who know me in truth. Love me gently, you who love. I do not turn my face from my own. I know them. Before they were, I knew them and set my seal on their faces. I fashioned their limbs and prepared my breasts for them, for them to drink my holy milk and live on it."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"116 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM The similarities of some of these expressions to the Gospel of Thomas are noteworthy (see, for instance, Gospel of Thomas 108). According to Christian traditions, Judas Thomas the twin was the brother of Jesus, and in Syrian tradition he was thought to be the twin brother of Jesus. This concept of the twin also functions importantly in Manichaean sacred lit- erature. The New Testament book of Jude is apparently attributed to this Judas, and in the Acts of Thomas, Judas Thomas is the apostolic missionary to northern Mesopotamia and India—hence the presence of the church of Saint Thomas in India to the present day. As the twin brother of Jesus, Judas Thomas was credited with special knowledge and insight, although not all Christians agreed with this positive assessment. In the Gospel of John, pre- sented above, this evaluation of Judas Thomas as a person of knowledge, Thomas the \"gnostic,\" is directly contradicted, and Thomas is portrayed as \"doubting Thomas,\" Thomas the \"agnostic.\" In the Song of the Pearl and, less directly, in the Gospel of Thomas and the Book of Thomas, the story of the soul is depicted in mythic narrative. The mythic story of the soul was recounted throughout the literature of an- tiquity and late antiquity. It was told by storytellers, interpreted by philoso- phers, and incorporated into texts of gnostic wisdom. It is the story of Eros (or, Cupid, love) and Psyche (soul), told by Apuleius of Madaura in his ro- mance entitled Metamorphoses (or The Golden Ass). The word psyche is femi- nine in gender in Greek, and the soul is often considered female in stories of the soul. In the Exegesis on the Soul, included here, the story of the soul is recounted in graphic form as the fall and restoration of the soul, who suc- cumbs to bodily and sexual defilement and is restored to her former condi- tion by her heavenly lover. Simon Magus, the first-century teacher from Samaria claimed by the heresiologists to be the founder of the gnostic religions, seems to have acted out a myth of the soul not unlike that described in Exegesis on the Soul. 12 Simon himself apparently was called \"the great power of god,\" an expression found in Acts 8:10, 13 and associated with a woman named Helena, whom he found working as a prostitute in Tyre and subsequently redeemed. He is said to have called her \"first thought\" (ennoia ) and imagined her incarnating and reincarnating as thought or soul in one human body after another—Helen of 12.

Simon Magus is paro- died as nothing but a cheap magician in the New Testament Acts of the Apos- tles 8 as well as the apocryphal Acts of Peter, which is the basis for the film The Silver Chalice. The Song of the Pearl is part of the apocryphal Acts of Thomas, a Syrian text. In the Acts of Thomas the messenger Judas Thomas is described as praying and meditating in an Indian prison, and there he writes the Song of the Pearl as a poem on the soul. The poem relates a quest for a pearl, sleep and forget- fulness while on the quest, and a call to remembrance. The speaker recites: I remembered that I was a son of kings and my free soul longed for its own kind. I remembered the pearl for which I was sent down into Egypt, and I began to enchant the terrible and snorting serpent. I charmed him into sleep by calling the name of my father over him and of my mother, the queen of the east. I seized the pearl and turned to carry it to my father. So ends, in enlightened discovery, the quest of the traveler, the quest of the soul. The traveler and the soul have sought and have found. ADDITIONAL LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM Several additional texts, which seem to represent gnostic religious options but which cannot be classified along with Sethian, Valentinian, or Thomas and Syrian literature with any confidence, are included in this part of the volume. The Exegesis on the Soul, like the Song of the Pearl, narrates the story of the career of the soul, but the Exegesis on the Soul stresses the seductive nature of the body and sexuality in its account of the fall of the soul, and the liberation of the soul from the filthiness of bodily corruption in its account of the restoration of the soul. The gnostic text On the Origin of the World resembles the Reality of the Rulers in a number of ways, and it contains themes that recall Sethian, Valentinian, Manichaean, and other religious traditions.

Rather, the Para- phrase of Shem is a gnostic account of the creation of the world, with strongly sexual characteristics, in which Shem is the hero. The Second Treatise of the Great Seth appears to be Sethian only in title. This text is a gnostic meditation on the meaning of the life and death of Jesus and the relationship between gnostic and emerging orthodox Christians. The Gospel of Mary, a fragmen- tary gospel attributed to Mary (that is, Mary of Magdala), is a gnostic dialogue of Jesus with his students. The Naassene Sermon describes \"serpentine\" gnos- tics, who studied the mystery religions and drew gnostic conclusions. The ser- mon contains passages reminiscent of the Gospel of Thomas, including a provocative statement that proclaims the remarkable transformation of those who are spiritual and embrace knowledge: \"This is the gate of heaven and the house of god, where the good god dwells alone, where no impure person en- ters, none psychical, none carnal. It is reserved for the spiritual alone, and those who come there must put on the wedding garments and all become bridegrooms, made masculine by the virgin spirit.\" Such is the gnostic message of hope for the spiritual and the enlightened.

Baruch maybe one of the earliest extant gnostic texts, 1 a missing gnostic link between Jewish monotheism and full-blown gnosticism. Elohim is still Elohim of Genesis 1:1, the essentially good creator god, but he is no longer the one almighty god, for now he reports to a deity above him, whose epithet is \"the Good.\" Elohim is not devoid of frailties—he is a blundering lover in the garden of Eden—yet he is not the demonized demiurge that he will become in classical gnosticism. In normative gnostic scripture, the creator god of the Hebrew Bible will be declared guilty of having created humans on earth and having locked their divine particles of spiritual light inside the prison of material flesh.

For now, in this quintessential moment of gnostic development, we have the anomaly of familiar almighty Jewish Elohim being guided by his new gnostic master, the Good. The Book of Baruch, then, is our first clear paradigm of gnostic dualism in which worldly and heavenly authority is shared by two di- vinities, one of whom, Elohim, will eventually become nearly synonymous with Satan, and the other, the Good, will become the core of the pleroma, the gnostic fullness from which all spirit emanates and to which all light returns. Early Jewish gnosticism is Jewish in speech and preoccupation. It still remembers its Hebrew names such as those of its leading figures Elohim and Edem (who is also called Israel), it concentrates on marriage and family, and the love scenes return to the erotic diction of the Song of Songs. Unlike other contemporary gnostic texts that are said to have had a Jewish Urtext, here the Jewish basis has not been excised. Robert W. Grant compares Baruch to \"the mystical Judaism we find in the Zohar, where Yahweh is called the father and Elohim the mother.\" 2 Jewish gnosticism is born in a first-century climate of diverse Jewish vi- sions, ranging from those of Utopian Essene communities in the desert to cos- mopolitan Jews in Alexandria, such as the philosopher Philo, who is filled with Torah, neoplatonism, and strategies of mystical ascension. In the midst of all this religious ferment and the political realities of Roman occupation, the de- struction of Jerusalem in 70 CE and the subsequent terrifying diaspora, Jewish gnosticism seems to gain strength as does the other new major Jewish sect, the messianists or Christians. The Christians offer faith in an earthly Jewish mes- siah who has become divine and identified with god, and who promises salva- tion after death—a matter of scant interest in the Hebrew Bible. By contrast, the gnostics will offer the promise of an interior light or breath, attainable during one's lifetime through the epiphany of gnosis. In Baruch, through the commands and actions of the Good, we see hints of a true paradise on earth and in heaven, which in its allegorical ending points to hope. Yet the narration ends with Eden still a conflicted mess, lacking harmony or immediate resolution. There will be no peaceable kingdom on earth until the human and divine forces on earth resolve their discord by means of an as yet unavailable fully gnostic design.

This fantastic, eclectic tale, speaking to diverse reli- gious audiences of the period, initiates the gnostic drama that will persist on many sundry stages for the next thirteen or fourteen hundred years. 3 The Book of Baruch has three principles: two male and one female. The two male principles are the Good and Elohim, the father of all, who is sta- tioned below the Good. The transcendent Good as the highest divine mani- festation clearly goes back to the good as the highest principle in platonic philosophy. The third figure is the female principle, Edem (earth) or Eden (garden), inferior to both, who is half woman and half beast. She participates in both upper and lower worlds. Humans are the fruit of the union of Elohim with Edem, from whom they receive spirit and soul respectively. 4 Father Elohim represents spirit and breathes spirit (pneuma) into the first- born Adam, while mother Edem, representing soul and earth, breathes soul (psyche) into Adam. When Elohim dumps Edem in Eden and returns to his creator, the Good, Edem is jealous and revengeful. As the drama unfolds and Edem brings out her angels, including the serpent Naas (from nahash, He- brew for \"serpent\"), to fight against what is left of Elohim's spirit on earth, Baruch, a top angel of the Good, sends a series of liberators—Moses, Herak- les, prophets, and finally Jesus—to ensure redemption and return. As the female principle, Edem in Baruch has many essences: she is garden; earth; Israel; creator of humans, beasts, and the soul; and a symbol of Eve, who is her creation and her double as the earth mother. Edem recalls the gnostic creator Sophia, thought and wisdom, who because of a disturbance and inad- equacy in god was separated from the One, fell from the pleroma, and created the world. The Good is the entirely new personage in this triadic system of principles, and he is already a gnostic figure in name and transcendent pow- ers. Elohim and Edem have a biblical past and a gnostic future. Elohim is still seen as a benign creator god and father, not the demiurge who imprisons par- ticles of light in earthly bodies, yet he now must rise to heaven, report to the Good, and confess his error in thinking himself the lord. Then he is redeemed. 3.From the vantage of Jewish orthodoxy, the violation of monotheism has also begun in the dualistic reception of a Jew called Jesus not only as the messiah —who in Judaism is foreseen as a human leader anointed and sent by god—but as a messiah (Christ) celebrated as god himself or as god's son or equal, sitting beside god in heaven on the closest throne. 4.

Indeed, Edem the mother shares with Elohim the father the deed of creating the earth. However, she has none of the heroic qualities of Eve of later gnosticism, who through her embodiment of knowl- edge offers salvific knowledge to humans during their residence on earth. The story that sets the main characters in supernatural action is the ro- mance between Elohim and Edem and the subsequent fallout of those dis- gruntled lovers. Their meeting is an idyllic tale of life among the angels, culminating in marriage. And before the lovers separate, they generate twenty-four angels. Twelve are paternal, twelve maternal, representing the good (male) and evil (female) sides of the cosmos. The third paternal angel is Baruch, and the third maternal angel is Naas, who, though male, fashions Edem's female strategies through his persuasions. They represent a dualistic good and evil, spirit and soul, the tree of life and the tree of knowledge. Elo- him, the world creator, learns of his inferiority before the highest god, the Good, who is his lord to whom he ascends. But by abandoning and thereby enraging his wife, he allows evil to come into the earth and specifically into Edem (Eve) and Adam. In her revenge against Elohim's desertion, Edem uses her baleful angels to infect the spirit that Elohim has left behind with no pro- tection, and that spirit becomes polluted with earthly soul. Elohim is portrayed not as wicked but as a neglectful god who has loved, married, and abandoned his woman. Edem's wild flaws reflect a woman's scorn for her wayward spouse. Each responds to dramatic circumstance. Edem, seething against fickle Elohim, who has escaped into the sky to leave her alone, opposes the spirit he has breathed into earthly humans and uses Naas to destroy it. To counter Edem's fury, the Good sends Elohim's angel Baruch back down to oppose Naas and to save rather than punish Edem: de- spite her war against the father, the woman, mother of Adam and of wild beasts, may also be redeemed. To heal the rift and make redemption possible for those of soul, including Edem, the Good directs Elohim to bring his di- verse prophets—a Jew, a Greek, and a Christian—back to the garden. These messengers, paying homage to each of the main religions of the day, are to combat evil and turn soul into spirit. In Justin's Baruch the author attempts ingenious solutions to resolve spiritual problems on earth. The angel Baruch turns to Moses, the prophets, and even Herakles, the Greek god of prodigious strength, whom he calls \"a prophet from the uncircumcised.\" All fail in their mission. Edem's ally Naas outwits them one by one."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM 123 The next resource for Baruch is Jesus, whose entry is imperative for a gnos- tic teacher intent on converting Christians and pagans as well as Jews. When Jesus comes to earth, Naas brings out his usual tricks and applies them to him. Jesus resists. After having seduced all the earlier prophets, Naas is furi- ous not to have defiled Jesus, and so he has him crucified. Jesus leaves his body to Edem by the tree (the Edenic tree and the cross) saying, \"Woman, here is your son\" (John 19:26). He delivers his spirit into the hand of the fa- ther (Luke 23:46). They all have failed, and even Jesus succeeds only in a lim- ited way: he saves his own spirit, which is delivered, as in the gospels, to \"the father,\" but he does not save the world or resolve the strife in paradise. More- over, while he delivers his spirit on earth to the father Elohim, Jesus ascends (in his resurrection) not to the father but to the Good. He rises into what will be the gnostic fullness. Jesus does not have the last word as a salvific figure. In this episode there is a resemblance to the later Qur'an, where Jesus is one of the prophets but not the ultimate savior. So the task of overcoming Naas and his evil continues. Now, almost as an explanatory afterthought (this concluding passage in Hippolytus is separated from the main text by writings that are not in Baruch), the angel Baruch sends down Priapos, the Greek phallic god of fertility, yet Naas persists. In a lovely and confused resolution, we again hear the voice of the Psalms, the gospels, and the Jewish prophets Isaiah and Hosea. Isaiah blames Israel (Edem) for not recognizing Elohim, and we seem to be back, in some unreflected, uncor- rected, and muddling way to both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, where Edem as both the earlier Eve in Eden and as Israel and the Jews does not listen to lord Elohim. The final sermon ends with what at first appears to be an excursion elsewhere but in fact fits in perfectly with its extraordinary panreli- gious appeal: the Good is equated with Priapos, Elohim with Zeus, Edem with Danae. This inconclusive ending is appropriate for a fabled book whose mes- sage points to three moments of gnostic development: a Jewish past, an eclec- tic present, and a fully gnostic future. Justin speaks for his day. In his syncretistic system, he includes fantastic borrowings from the main contemporary sources to persuade Jews, Chris- tians, and Greeks to embrace this widely inclusive and developing gnostic speculation. Everyone is welcome: Elohim, Edem, Moses, Baruch, Jesus, Pria- pos, and Zeus.

One of the male principles is called the Good, and it alone carries that epithet 10 and knows everything ahead of time. The other male principle is named father of all things begotten in the world, has no forethought, and he is unknown and invisible. The female is angry. She knows nothing ahead of time and she has two minds and two bodies. As in Herodotos's myth, she is a virgin above and a viper below. 11 She is called both Edem and Israel. These are the principles of the cosmos, the roots and pools from which all sprang, and nothing else was in the world. When the father knowing nothing beforehand saw that half-virgin Edem, 12 he burned for her, and he the father is called Elohim, 13 and Edem burned equally for Elohim. Their desire drew them to a single union of love. From this coupling the father seeded twelve angels for himself through Edem. The paternal angels are Michael, Amen, Baruch, Gabriel, Esaddaeus 10.

Their common domain is paradise, about which Moses tells us, \"God planted paradise east of Eden,\" 15 before the face of Edem, and therefore she always looks at paradise, her angels.

Moses spoke these things covertly because not everyone can hold the truth. THE CREATION OF ADAM AND EVE After paradise came into being through the love of Elohim and Edem, the angels of Elohim took some of the best earth (not from the bestial, naked part of Edem but from her upper, civilized regions) and from that good earth they made man, 16 but from the bestial land came wild beasts and creatures.

Huddled in these four parts, the twelve angels circle around and govern the cosmos. Their authority over the world comes from Edem. They are not forever in the same region, but as in a circular chorus they move from place to place at fixed intervals and periods according to their assignments.

But Naas disobeyed. He approached Eve and seduced her and debauched her, which is a transgression, and he approached Adam and played with him as a boy, which is a transgression. 23.

In the hypothetical Jewish text the re- vealer and savior must have been the heavenly forethought of god, as is clear from the hymn of the savior that concludes the revelation in the longer ver- sion of the Secret Book of John. In the hymn of the savior, and elsewhere in the Secret Book of John, the revealer speaks in the first-person singular (\"I\"). In the earlier Jewish text, the revealer would have been Barbelo, the fore- thought of god, but in the present Christian version of the Secret Book of John, the revealer is Jesus. The Secret Book of John explains the contrast between an absolutely ex- cellent and all-transcendent One (or monad) and an absurd and fallen world by means of an intricate mythological account of a god who emanates, creates, falls, and finally is saved. It combines insights derived from Genesis with Greek philosophical and mythological themes to produce a dramatic story of salvation, a remarkable account of the evolution, and the devolution, of the invisible divine spirit. Greek psychology and philosophy (platonism, for example) posited a sys- tem in which the mind is linked to the divine and the divine is said to be mind. Accordingly, the Secret Book of John employs a series of Greek terms related to the word mind (nous) in order to describe the career of the divine and the creation of the cosmos. The account describes the invisible spirit or mind ex- tending itself through a thought (ennoia), a forethought (pronoia), until it achieves an enlightened state of mind (nous) and a spiritual fullness (pleroma). Alas, a loss of wisdom (Sophia) brings about mindlessness (aponoia); the restoration of wisdom is finally accomplished through the expression of di- vine afterthought (epinoia).

The One is not corporeal and is not incorporeal. The One is not large and is not small. It is impossible to say, \"How much is it?

Not that it is greater. 14 Rather, as it is in itself, it is not a part of the eternal realms or of time. For whatever is part of a realm was once prepared by another. Time was not allotted to it, since it receives nothing from anyone: what would be re- ceived would be on loan. The one who is first does not need to receive any- thing from another. Such a one beholds itself in its light. The One is majestic and has an immeasurable purity. The One is a realm that gives a realm, life that gives life, a blessed one that gives blessedness, knowledge that gives knowledge, a good one that gives goodness, mercy that gives mercy and redemption, grace that gives grace. Not as if the One possesses all this. Rather, it is that the One gives immeas- urable and incomprehensible light. What shall I tell you about it? Its eternal realm is incorruptible, at peace, dwelling in silence, at rest, before everything. 15 It is the head of all realms, and it sustains them through its goodness.

He reflects on his image everywhere, sees it in the spring of the spirit, and becomes enam- ored of his luminous water, for his image is in the spring of pure luminous water surrounding him. 17 The father's thought became a reality, and she who appeared in the pres- ence of the father in shining light came forth. She is the first power who pre- ceded everything and came forth from the father's mind as the forethought of all. Her light shines like the father's light; she, the perfect power, is the image of the perfect and invisible virgin spirit. 18 She, the first power, the glory of Barbelo, the perfect glory among the realms, the glory of revelation, she glorified and praised the virgin spirit, for because of the spirit she had come forth. She is the first thought, the image of the spirit. She became the universal womb, for she precedes everything, the mother-father, 19 the first human, the holy spirit, the triple male, 20 the triple power, the androgynous one with three names, the eternal realm among the invisible beings, the first to come forth. 17. The father gazes into the water and falls in love with his own image in a manner that calls to mind Narcissus in Greek mythology (see Ovid, Metamorphoses 3.402-510). 18. Through this love of the father for his own image the father's thought (Coptic ennoia, from Greek) emanated, and the first thought or forethought (Coptic pronoia, from Greek) comes from the mind of the father: the divine mother, Barbelo. The father thus produces an entity in- dependently, without the aid of a lover. Other gods who are credited with acts of independent procreation include the Greek god Zeus, who produces Athena the daughter of Metis (wisdom or skill) from his head alongside the River (or Lake) Triton (see Hesiod, Theogony 886-900, 924-29), or the Egyptian god Atum, who mates with his hand and spits, that is, he produces the seed of life by means of masturbation. On Sophia conceiving independently, see below. 19. Coptic metropator (from Greek), probably a term for an androgynous parent. 20. This is a term of praise, in which maleness symbolizes all that is heavenly, like the divine father, and maleness is amplified by being male three times over. Even Barbelo can be a triple male!

The spirit anointed it with its own goodness until it was perfect, with no lack of goodness, since it was anointed with the goodness of the invisi- ble spirit. The child stood in the presence of the spirit as the spirit anointed the child. When the child received this from the spirit, at once it glorified the holy spirit and perfect forethought. Because of her it had come forth. 24 The child asked to be given mind 25 as a companion to work with, and the spirit consented. When the invisible spirit consented, mind appeared and stood by the anointed, and glorified the spirit 26 and Barbelo. All these beings came into existence in silence. Mind wished to create something by means of the word of the invisible spirit. 27 Its will became a reality and appeared, with mind and the light, glori- fying it. Word followed will. For the anointed, the self-conceived god, 28 cre- ated everything by the word. Life eternal, will, mind, and foreknowledge stood together and glorified the invisible spirit and Barbelo, for because of her they had come into being. The holy spirit brought the self-conceived divine child of itself and Bar- belo to perfection, so that the child might stand before the great, invisible vir- gin spirit as the self-conceived god, the anointed, who honored the spirit 29 with loud acclaim. The child came forth through forethought. The invisible virgin spirit set the true, self-conceived god over everything, and caused all authority and the truth within to be subject to it, so that the child might un- derstand everything, the one called by a name greater than every name, for that name will be told to those who are worthy of it. 23. Spiritual intercourse between the father and Barbelo produces a child of light. In the long version of the Secret Book of John, the father is considered to be the active procreative force. In the version found in BG 8502 and Nag Hammadi Codex III, Barbelo is the one who gazes into the father or the pure light, and then she gives birth. 24.

He thus functions as a savior of humans, but he is punished for his actions by being chained to a pillar in the moun- tains, where a bird of prey continually eats his liver.

The fourth eternal realm has been set up for the fourth luminary, Eleleth. There are three other realms with it: perfection, peace, Sophia.

The twelve realms belong to the child of the self-conceived one, and everything was established by the will of the holy spirit through the self-conceived one. GERADAMAS AND SETH Now, from the foreknowledge of the perfect mind, through the expressed will of the invisible spirit and the will of the self-conceived one, came the perfect human, the first revelation, the truth. The virgin spirit named the human Ger- adamas 35 and appointed Geradamas to the first eternal realm with the great self-conceived, the anointed, by the first luminary, Harmozel. Its powers dwell with it. The invisible one gave Geradamas an unconquerable power of mind. Geradamas spoke and glorified and praised the invisible spirit by saying, \"Because of you everything has come into being, and to you everything will return. \"I shall praise and glorify you, and the self-conceived, and the eternal realms, the three—father, mother, child, the perfect power.\" Geradamas appointed his son Seth to the second eternal realm, before the second luminary, Oroiael.

Pearson), that is, Adam who is an alien in this world but is at home in the divine realm. For other suggestions for the meaning of Geradamas, see lames E.

THE FALL OF SOPHIA Now, Sophia, who is the wisdom of afterthought and who constitutes an eter- nal realm, conceived of a thought from herself, with the conception of the in- visible spirit and foreknowledge. She wanted to bring forth something like herself, without the consent of the spirit, who had not given approval, without her partner and without his consideration. 37 The male did not give approval. She did not find her partner, and she considered this without the spirit's con- sent and without the knowledge of her partner. Nonetheless, she gave birth. And because of the invincible power within her, her thought was not an idle thought. Something came out of her that was imperfect and different in ap- pearance from her, for she had produced it without her partner. It did not re- semble its mother and was misshapen. When Sophia saw what her desire had produced, it changed into the figure of a snake with the face of a lion. Its eyes were like flashing bolts of lightning. She cast it away from her, outside that realm so that none of the immortals would see it. She had produced it ignorantly. She surrounded it with a bright cloud and put a throne in the middle of the cloud so that no one would see it except the holy spirit, who is called the mother of the living. She named her offspring Yaldabaoth. YALDABAOTH'S WORLD ORDER Yaldabaoth is the first ruler, who took great power from his mother. Then he left her and moved away from the place where he was born. He took control 37. Sophia tries to imitate the original procreative act of the father. This account of Sophia bringing forth by herself seems to reflect ancient gynecological theories about women's bodies and reproduction. In Greek mythology the goddess Hera also imitates Zeus and brings forth a child by herself. According to one version of the myth, the child is the monster Typhon (Home- ric Hymn to Pythian Apollo 300-62). According to another, it is the lame deity Hephaistos, whom Hera evicts from Olympus and sends down to the world below (Hesiod, Theogony 924-29). Hephaistos, the artisan among the gods, is represented in Egypt by his counterpart Khnum, a ram-headed creator who molds creatures on a potter's wheel.

But for a long time their creation did not stir or move at all. When the mother wanted to take back the power she had relinquished to the first ruler, she prayed to the most merciful mother-father of all. With a sacred command the mother-father sent five luminaries down to the place of the angels of the first ruler. They advised him so that they might recover the mother's power. They said to Yaldabaoth, Breathe some of your spirit into the face of Adam, and then the body will arise. He breathed his spirit into Adam. 63 The spirit is the power of his mother, but he did not realize this, because he lives in ignorance. The mother's power went out of Yaldabaoth and into the psychical body that had been made to be like the one who is from the beginning. The body moved and became powerful. 64 And it was enlightened. At once the rest of the powers became jealous. Although Adam had come into being through all of them, and they had given their power to this human, Adam was more intelligent than the creators and the first ruler. When they re- alized that Adam was enlightened, and could think more clearly than they, and was stripped of evil, 65 they took and threw Adam into the lowest part of the whole material realm. The blessed, benevolent, merciful mother-father had compassion for the mother's power that had been removed from the first ruler. The rulers might be able to overpower the psychical, perceptible body once again. So with its benevolent spirit and great mercy the mother-father sent a helper to Adam, an enlightened afterthought who is from the mother-father and who was called life. 66 She helped the whole creature, laboring with it, restoring it to its full- ness, teaching it about the descent of the seed, teaching it about the way of as- cent, which is the way of descent.

And Adam's ability to think was greater than that of all the creators. When they looked up, they saw that Adam's ability to think was greater, and they devised a plan with the whole throng of rulers and angels. They took fire, earth, and water, and combined them with the four fiery winds. 68 They wrought them together and made a great commotion. 69 The rulers brought Adam into the shadow of death so that they might produce a figure again, from earth, water, fire, and the spirit that comes from matter, 70 that is, from the ignorance of darkness, and desire, and their own false spirit. This is the cave for remodeling the body that these criminals put on the human, the fetter of forgetfulness. 71 Adam became a mortal being, the first to descend and the first to become estranged. The enlightened afterthought within Adam, however, would rejuvenate Adam's mind. The rulers took Adam and put Adam in paradise. They said, Eat, meaning, do so in a leisurely manner. 72 But in fact their pleasure is bitter and their beauty is perverse. Their pleasure is a trap, their trees are a sacrilege, their fruit is deadly poison, their promise is death.

But I 77 was the one who induced them to eat. I 78 said to the savior, Master, was it not the snake that instructed Adam to eat? The savior laughed and said, The snake instructed them to eat of the wickedness of sexual desire and destruction so that Adam might be of use to the snake.

As in the Secret Book of John, the arrogant ruler decides to create a mate- rial earth and fashion a human in the image of the high god, made from the earth. He does so, but the human is merely material and lies on the ground, in- capable of rising. So the demiurge breathes life into him, but then he is only psychical, animated with a worldly soul from the world ruler. Finally the spirit comes to live in Adam, and he is able to rise. After he is placed in the garden and put to sleep, woman is taken from his side. She is spiritual (endowed with pneuma) and wakes him, saying, \"Arise, Adam.\" When he sees her, he says, \"You have given me life. You will be called 'mother of the living.'\" Then darkness enters. Dazzled by Eve's beauty, the rulers lust for her and try to rape her and sow seed in her. They pursue her, and like Daphne she turns into a tree, leaving a shadow of herself, which they rape foully. Here the text has assumed the Greco-Roman myth of Daphne and Apollo, with a new twist. Then the snake—which, in a remarkable revision of the Genesis ac- count, is called the instructor, because it knows and teaches about knowl- edge—urges Eve to eat the fruit and obtain knowledge, whereupon begin the Genesis problems of shame, banishment, exile, and mortality. The character who emerges as a new gnostic hero is Norea, Eve's virgin daughter. She successfully confronts both Noah and the rulers of darkness. She asks Noah to let her enter his ark, and when he refuses, she burns it. Norea (here also called Orea, perhaps \"beautiful\") thus assumes independence and great powers. When the rulers find her and desire her, she defies them and curses the arrogant god himself for his lechery, claiming her descent from the world above. She turns to the god of all to rescue her, and he sends down Eleleth, the great angel and luminary from the heavens. At her request he tells her about the world above, separated by a veil from the realms below. And so the narration moves to an accounting of the apocalyptic space of the gods.

This speech rose up to incorrupt- ibility. 10 Then there was a voice that came forth from incorruptibility, saying, \"You are wrong, Samael,\" that is, god of the blind. 11 His thoughts became blind. And having expelled his power—that is, the blas- phemy he had spoken—he pursued it down to chaos and the abyss, his mother, at the instigation of Pistis Sophia. 12 She 13 established each of his offspring in conformity with its power, after the pattern of the realms that are above, for by starting from the invisible world the visible world was invented. 2.

The rulers gathered together all the animals of the earth and all the birds of heaven and brought them in to Adam to see what Adam would call them, that he might give a name to each of the birds and all the beasts. 27 The rulers took Adam and put him in the garden, that he might cultivate it and keep watch over it. They issued a command to him, saying, \"From every tree in the garden shall you eat, but from the tree of knowledge of good and evil don't eat, nor touch it. For the day you eat from it you will surely die.\" 28 They said this to him, but they did not understand what they said. 29 Rather, by the father's will, they said this in such a way that he might in fact eat, and that Adam might not 30 regard them as would a man of an exclusively material nature. 31 The rulers took counsel with one another and said, \"Come, let us cause a deep sleep to fall on Adam.\" 32 And he slept. Now, the deep sleep that they caused to fall on him, and he slept, is ignorance.

When they saw his female partner speaking with him, they became very excited and enamored of her. They said to one another, \"Come, let us sow our seed in her,\" and they pursued her. And she laughed at them for their foolishness and blindness. In their clutches she became a tree and left before them her shadowy reflection resembling herself, and they defiled it foully. And they defiled the seal of her voice, so that by the form they had modeled, together with their own image, they made themselves liable to condemnation. 35 Then the female spiritual presence came in the form of the snake, the in- structor, 36 and it taught them, 37 saying, \"What did he 38 say to you? Was it, 'From every tree in the garden shall you eat, but from the tree of recognizing evil and good do not eat'?\" The woman of flesh 39 said, \"Not only did he say 'Don't eat,' but even 'Don't touch it. For the day you eat from it, you will surely die.'\" The snake, the instructor, said, \"It is not the case that you will surely die, for out of jealousy he said this to you. Rather, your eyes will open and you will be like gods, recognizing evil and good.\" And the female instructing power was taken away from the snake, and she left it behind, merely a thing of the earth. 40 And the woman of flesh took from the tree and ate, and she gave to her husband as well as herself, and those beings, who possessed only a soul, 41 ate. And their imperfection became apparent in their lack of knowledge. They rec- ognized that they were naked of the spiritual, and they took fig leaves and bound them around themselves. Then the chief ruler came, and he said, \"Adam, where are you?\"—for he did not understand what had happened. 35. This passage closely resembles the Greek myth of Daphne changing into a laurel tree.

The woman said, \"The snake led me astray and I ate.\" They 43 turned to the snake and cursed its shadowy reflection, so it was powerless, and they did not comprehend that it was a form they themselves had modeled. 44 From that day, the snake came to be under the curse of the authorities. Until the perfect human 45 was to come, that curse fell on the snake. They turned to their Adam and took him and expelled him from the gar- den along with his wife, for they 46 have no blessing, since they too are under the curse.

Com- JL. posed as early as the first or second century CE, this Jewish gnostic apocalypse (with apparently no Christian element in or amended to it) is rec- ognized as a transition stage from Jewish apocalypse to gnostic apocalypse. 1 In this apocalypse Adam reveals to his son Seth a history of human creation, before and after the fall, and a way to redemption through secret knowledge. The revelation occurs as a dream vision passed on by Adam, in his seven hundredth year, and on his deathbed, to Seth and his seed. It has the form of a historical testament. It moves from a period when Adam and his consort, Eve, were like eternal angels, existing above the creator god. Spiritual Eve imparted her knowl- edge of the eternal god to Adam, but that knowledge and the paradisal condi- tion were lost when the demiurge took knowledge from them and instructed them only about \"dead things.\" Then to wake Adam and Eve from dark igno- rance and slavery, three persons (heavenly messengers) come to Adam and Eve and say, \"Rise, Adam, from the sleep of death.\" They reveal to Adam hints of the great race that will come from the heavenly seed of Seth. i. Some have seen the Revelation's third story of the origin of the illuminator as a story about Jesus, but Douglas M.

More significant, the angels of the great light save the people of knowledge, the Sethians, who live for six hun- dred years. And from Noah's seed, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, come the people of the world, the descendants of Shem and thirteen kingdoms from Ham and Japheth. The thirteenth kingdom consists of four hundred thousand people who will live with those who have the great eternal knowledge. The Revelation of Adam seems to distinguish several groups of people on the earth, according to their degree of enlightenment: The seed of Seth, the gnostics.

These include not only the twelve kingdoms that constitute the people of this world but also the four hundred thousand, the thirteenth kingdom that sojourns with the seed of Seth. These must form a special group, drawn from the people of the world and associated with the gnostics of the seed of Seth. 3 Bentley Layton, acknowledging the difficulties faced in distinguishing the different groups of people in the Revelation of Adam, suggests that that text may intend to specify a division of human beings into three essential groups: the seed of Seth, the descendants of the sons of Noah, and the four hundred thousand. Such a threefold division, Layton concludes, may be reminiscent of the Valentinian tendency to divide people into three groups. 4 Sakla the creator, in a way that may recall the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, brings apocalyptic catastrophes of fire, sulfur, and asphalt darken- ing the powers of the luminaries of the world, the sun and the moon.

The thirteen king- doms utter marvelous tales of the origin and nature of the illuminator, the savior, who we understand is a manifestation linked to heavenly Seth. Each description is a minor apocalypse, each more fantastic. Each of the state- ments by these thirteen kingdoms ends with the statement \"and in this way he came to the water.\" The water endings may be a baptismal rite, yet even the coming to the water is not an assurance of purification, for with desire and darkness those waters too can be polluted by the wicked. And it is the generation or race without a king over it—the Sethian gnostics—that has the true view of the origin of the illuminator. More Sethian insights into the true origin of the illumination may be gained from the fuller account in The Se- cret Book of John, especially the concluding hymn of the savior. Near the end of the Revelation of Adam a paragraph celebrates the fate of the words of this revelation. Though unwritten, these words will be brought by angels to \"a high mountain, upon a rock of truth,\" and they will be known as words of truth and incorruptibility.

It features a divine triad of father, mother, and child (or son), who each descend as first thought, Protennoia. First thought's descents from the pleroma to earth are also symbolized as voice, speech, and word. The profound poetry of Three Forms of First Thought shares with most gnostic scripture an exuberant gift for mythopoetic language. In its lexicon and three stages, Three Forms of First Thought resembles the Secret Book of John, probably written about the same time: both apocalyptic treatises offer a philosophical meditation on the formation and history of the universe. In the Secret Book of John there is a triple descent of the redeemer—from the riches of light in the heavenly pleroma; to the second period in darkness, chaos, and the prison of the body; to the third phase, where, being the pure light in light, the redeemer speaks to the redeemable and pronounces a wak- ening call for their deliverance. In its revelation of the creation, fall, and salva- tion of the world and its people, the Secret Book of John resembles the Three Forms of First Thought's discourse by the personified Protennoia in her three revelatory descents as heavenly redeemer. Protennoia's ultimate purpose is to combat the darkness that earth's inhabitants have fallen under as a result of the plots of their chief creator, the boasting demiurge, and offer the children of light hope of redemption."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"190 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM Protennoia, first thought, is female. But she lives in the light, who is the fa- ther of all, and in her is also the divine child, the son of god. So the book be- gins, \"I am first thought, the thought that is in light. I am movement that is in all, she in whom the realm of all takes its stand.\" The figures and attributes manifest a complex variety from the very first statements of the text. First thought is also the eternal being of Barbelo. As a woman and female principle she evokes Sophia, wisdom in her earlier descent with all her creation. She also corresponds to the son in the form of the logos, the savior. This mingled scheme of references, ecstatically uttered, and its continued mingling, from the very first lines of Jewish, gnostic, and Christian elements, leads John Turner to state, Trimorphic Protennoia has undergone at least three states of composition. First, there was the original triad of the aretalogi- cal self-predications [\"I am\" statements] of Protennoia as Voice, Speech, and Word that were probably built up out of the Jewish wisdom tradition and maybe out of The Apocryphon of John's similar Pronoia aretalogy itself sometime during the first cen- tury C.E.; there is little here that seems specifically gnostic or Christian or Sethian or Barbeloite. Second, this was supple- mented ... by various narrative doctrinal passages based upon traditional Barbeloite theogonical materials [about the emer- gence of the divine realm] After circulation as a mildly Chris- tian Barbeloite text in this form, the third and last stage of composition seems to have involved a deliberately polemical in- corporation of Christian, specifically Johannine Christian, ma- terials into the aretalogical portion of the third subtractate. 1 Initially, the voice of first thought descends as a light force into darkness and shapes the fallen in their world of error and mortality. They have experi- enced the destructions brought on by the chief creator of the earth (who is the demiurge, called variously Sakla, Samael, and Yaldabaoth). The victims of the creator listen to the mother, who offers the mystery hidden from the eternal beings, which is embedded in the formation of language itself. She tells them, i.

She offers hope to save the children of light on the earth, telling them they will be as they were when they were light. In the second descent, the speech of first thought gives spirit and breath to the fallen. And in the third, the word or logos of thought descends in human form and restores the fallen to light, a feat accomplished by means of the bap- tismal rite of the five seals. The human form may be Christ the anointed, who is mentioned a few times, reflecting the tractate's light christianization, which, though at moments polemical, seems to lack conviction. This is not funda- mentally a Christian treatise. Nonetheless, it still merits comparison with the opening hymn to the word or logos in the Gospel of John. The discourse ends with a gnostic baptismal rite leading to the five seals that contain the light of ineffable knowledge. In the last line we learn that the author of this sacred scripture is the father of perfect knowledge.

And a great thunder disturbed the allotments of fate and those who ap- portion the houses. 30 The thrones of the powers were disturbed because they were overturned, and their king was afraid.

The Three Steles praise each member of the divine family in turn: the invisible father (addressed, as in the Secret Book of John, as the One [or monad], the five, the ineffable); his counterpart, Barbelo; and the self-conceived child. The Jewish historian Josephus recounts a story of how the descendants of Seth preserved the wis- dom of Adam, Eve, and Seth by inscribing it on two steles of brick and stone, in order to preserve it through hell and high water. This legend becomes the occasion for explaining the origin of the present text, in which the original two steles may have become three to allow for praise to the threefold nature of the divine family. A similar legend may suggest that Hermetic texts were also preserved on steles and thus were communicated to later generations. This legend is recounted in the Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth. The Three Steles of Seth claims to be the original set of divine hymns of praise formulated through heavenly Seth and his father, Geradamas, and re- covered as a latter-day collection of hymns. Reading them, it is easy to imag- ine the gnostic Sethian community at worship, offering hymns of praise to the divine family. The text concludes with instructions for the use of the hymns: they are to be used in a liturgy of ecstatic ascent—inviting the wor- shiper to approach god, see god, and learn \"about things infinite\"—and re- turn from ascent."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"202 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM The contents of the hymns recall other texts written in the spirit of Seth, such as the Secret Book of John, the Vision of the Foreigner, the Sermon of Zostrianos, and Marsanes. 1 The Three Steles of Seth reflects Jewish and neo- platonic philosophical ideas, the latter particularly in the numerous references to the neoplatonic triad of existence, life, and mind. The Three Steles of Seth was likely composed in Greek. The date and place of composition are unknown, though Alexandria, Egypt, is as likely a place of composition as any other that has been proposed. Since the neoplatonic philosopher Plotinos taught a course against the gnostics in 265-66 CE, and his student Porphyry mentions Zostrianos, the Foreigner (Allogenes), and other gnostic works, the first half of the third century has been proposed as a plau- sible time of composition.

In this text Allogenes the for- eigner has a visionary experience of the divine, and at the end of the text (not included here) it is said that he writes it down in the document for his child Messos. The neoplatonist author Porphyry maintains that Ploti- nos opposed gnostics who used revelations by Allogenes and Messos, among others, and the present text may be one of the works referred to by Porphyry. The role of Allogenes as foreigner or one from another race suggests that the visionary protagonist of this text may be Seth—described in Genesis as \"an- other seed\" in place of the dead Abel—or a follower of Seth, or every person, every gnostic who follows the enlightened way of Sethian knowledge. In the section of the text translated here, the foreigner has a vision of the divine that recalls the Secret Book of John and other Sethian literature. Earlier in the text the foreigner has been instructed in the proper method of medita- tion, and now the foreigner employs this method in the visionary experience. The visionary experience is understood not as an ascent upward through stages of enlightenment but rather as an inner experience of deeper and deeper insight. The foreigner thus envisions within self aspects of the divine, in silence, as a part of the inner journey. But the revelatory vision of god within is hardly the end of the experience.

Karen L. King suggests a date of composition in the first quarter of the third century to correspond with the likelihood that Plotinos knew of the text. She also suggests, more tentatively, that the text may have been written in Egypt, possibly in Alexandria. 1 VISION OF THE FOREIGNER 2 Through a primary revelation of the first one, 3 which is unknown to all, I saw the god that is greater than perfection, and the triple power 4 that exists in all. I was seeking the ineffable, unknowable god, of which people are ignorant even if they understand it at all, the mediation of the triple power, which is located in stillness and silence and is unknowable. When I was empowered by these things, the powers of the luminaries 5 said to me, You have done enough to hinder the inactivity that is in you by seeking what is incomprehensible. Rather, hear about it, as is possible, through a pri- mary revelation and a revelation. 6 Does it 7 exist through its own being, or does it exist and will it come fur- ther into being? Does it act? Does it know? Is it alive? For it has no mind, no life, nothing real—and nothing unreal, incomprehensibly. Does it come from what it has?

Zoroaster himself is mentioned, along with Zostrianos, in the set of cryptographic titles and descriptions after the conclusion of the text. Revelations by Zostrianos and Zoroaster are also re- ferred to by Porphyry in his Life ofPlotinos as texts known to neoplatonists, and Porphyry claims that Plotinos's student Amelios wrote as many as forty volumes refuting the book of Zostrianos. Although the text of Zostrianos is poorly preserved and in fragmentary condition, parts of the text are quite legible, including the beginning, where the author, writing in the name of Zostrianos, recounts his call. Once he was in the desert, meditating on deep questions, when he grew profoundly de- pressed, to the point of contemplating suicide.

Sethian and other gnostic texts refer to baptism and the importance of baptism. In the Secret Book of John, for example, the awakened person is raised and sealed \"in luminous water with five seals, that death might not prevail over the person from that moment on.\" Another Sethian text, the Three Forms of First Thought, describes gnostic baptism in a series of ceremonial acts: stripping off the darkness, dressing in a robe of light, being baptized or washed in the water of life, and being enthroned, glorified, raised, and sealed with five seals. The point of baptism, the Three Forms of First Thought suggests, is knowledge and enlightenment.

The last such figure is Yoel, who is stationed over the name of the one baptizing \"with the holy, incorruptible baptism that surpasses heaven.\" The balance of the Baptismal Ceremony of the Gospel of the Egyptians consists mainly of a hymn that is apparently uttered by the person being baptized. The hymn is an ecstatic statement of confession and praise, and it incorporates, after the manner of some other gnostic texts and magical texts of ritual power, the chanting of the (Greek) vowels. However this baptismal ceremony was enacted (or under- stood on a metaphoric level, rather than literally enacted), baptism is here portrayed as an ecstatic celebration. As the text puts it, those baptized \"have been instructed and have understood, and they will not taste death.\" The Gospel of the Egyptians was composed in Greek, but the circum- stances of composition are unknown. The text is now represented in two Cop- tic versions in the Nag Hammadi library. THE BAPTISMAL CEREMONY OF THE GOSPEL OF THE EGYPTIANS 1 Through forethought Seth established what is holy and the baptism that sur- passes the heavens—through what is holy, through what is incorruptible, and through Jesus, 2 who has been conceived by a living word 3 and with whom great Seth has been clothed.

Commentators on Thunder have looked to Sanskrit, Egyptian, and Jewish religious literature to find equivalents for its pervasive use of oxymoron, antithesis, and paradox. How- ever, it is not necessary to confine oneself to religious sources for precedents, since these rhetorical tropes are standard in classical and later literature, and their enunciation in the terms we still use today was established by Greek grammarians in hellenistic Alexandria on the basis of examples drawn from Greek poetry, from Sappho to Pindar. The author of Thunder wrote in Greek, and his poem follows the prosody of Greek verse. As an obscure imitator of Greek and Hebrew expression, the author reproduced the forms and breath of Pindar and the verbal elan of the biblical prophets. Thunder is a strange book whose voice is that of a powerful, confessional Sophia figure who takes on the world with extraordinary vigor and piercing candor. She is not an aloof prophet or a cloistered sibyl, but an assertive woman engaged in all strata of human society. In the course of Thunder, the woman relentlessly contradicts herself: \"What you see outdoors you see within you,\" or \"I am speech undecipherable,\" or \"I am below and they come up to me.\" And she shows no remorse for her dissenting ways. Although the author's sex is unknown, the female voice in the text speaks for herself, and as such is an early instance of complete female empowerment, without apology or compromise. She speaks a metaphysical tour de force, a sermon singing the self in which the woman is the universal paradigm. Her presence adds ev- idence to Elaine Pagels's persuasive assertion of women's freer role in gnosti- cism, which she documents in The Gnostic Gospels. What can be said with certainty is that the woman of Thunder represents a great woman's voice in antiquity. The woman in Thunder prepares her \"interior bread and mind.\" She has no shame in being seen anywhere provided that she follows her spiritual con- victions, even if \"cast down on the earth\" and \"lying on animal dung.\" She sternly abuses and demeans herself yet affirms herself.

Incorporating much of the technical language of Valen- tinian gnosticism, the Gospel of Truth presents its ideas in a nontechnical way as the proclamation of the meaning of Jesus for Valentinian Christians. This is a pivotal work, reinterpreting Jewish apocalyptic Christianity as Jewish gnos- tic Christianity. A deeply gnostic tractate, seminally influenced by Johannine literature, the Gospel of Truth maps a way of knowing the father through the word of gnosis, which is mystical knowledge. Written in Greek in the mid-second century, between about 140 and 180 CE, the Gospel of Truth was found among the documents at Nag Hammadi in Egypt and exists in its totality in Coptic translation. In addition, Irenaeus refers to a Gospel of Truth read among Valentinians in his tract Against Here- sies 3.11.9- Scholars have advanced arguments for assigning the work to Valentinos himself, rather than to one of his students. Valentinos, a mediator between gnosticized and traditional Christianity, was born in Alexandria and from about 135 practiced his gnostic interpretation of Christianity in Rome. Al- though Valentinians were attacked by traditional Christians for their mythic theology as early as 160, they did not initially separate on their own from Christians, and some held ecclesiastical ranks in the Roman church. They called themselves the students of Christ, were largely from the middle and lower classes, and resembled other Christians in many respects."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"240 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM The Valentinians met privately and later in churches, as students guided by scholars. Many of their leaders were women, for whom gnostic Christianity held out positions as leaders and teachers not available in the official church. The Valentinians saw their mythic theologies as allegorical commentaries on the Hebrew Bible and Christian scripture, but their opponents saw them as extravagant heresies. In Valentinian gnosticism Christ and the word (logos) are eternal beings (aeons), and Jesus is brought forth to bring salvation and enlightenment here below. This recalls the logos made flesh in the Gospel of John. But beyond some common interpretations of the life of Christ, their be- liefs and documents clashed. One cannot read the Valentinian documents without concluding that gnosticism was different, and not just allegorically, from mainstream Christianity. The Valentinians offered a whole new scheme of salvation through knowledge, and an unknowable father in the heavenly realm of light, which is the pleroma or fullness. Traditional Christians were right to suspect otherness in the Valentinians. The Gospel of Truth begins with a Jewish-Christian enunciation of joy in the good news of the gospel, which brings hope to those who would seek the fa- ther. The following lines describe the generation of ignorance and error, which derives ultimately from the father. Here ignorance, terror, and error reside in the pleroma, which resides in the father. It is clear that this represents a crisis in the pleroma, site of the thirty aeons of light, but the text suggests that the father is neither responsible for this error nor diminished in his powers. In the contrast, the paradox, between the error in the pleroma and the goodness of the father we have perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this sermon of truth. Somehow, from the very realm of the good father, error comes. Herein lies the mystery, for gnostics, of the goodness of the divine and the reality of evil in the world. This section ends with the appearance and death of Jesus the anointed, whose fate at the hands of \"error\" is described in an amazing passage that in a few words sets Jewish-Christian orthodoxy apart from gnosticism: He was nailed to a tree. He became a fruit of the knowledge of the father. He did not, however, destroy them because they ate of it. He rather caused those who ate of it to be joyful because of this discovery. This passage reverses the fundamental biblical notion that knowledge is sin. It dissolves the original stricture against obtaining knowledge by eating of its fruit, for which disobedience came a punishment of shame, sensuality, and death.

It signifies that one finds god in oneself, that the fog of error and terror is gone, and that the nightmare of darkness is exchanged for an eternal heavenly day. Therein is stated the essence of gnosis: the word of knowledge redeems rather than kills. There follows an idealized, moving portrait of the son, of whom the father is not jealous, and who utters no threat of gnashing teeth or hell and brimstone to fellow Jews who do not accept that he is the messiah. In addition to being a quiet guide of sheep gone astray, the implied Jesus also teaches a portrait of the father's face. We soon realize that the father, not the son, is the center of the sermon, and he is personified and endowed with utter sweetness. The return of the awakened ones is then described in the superb poetry of gnosticism: Until the moment when they who are passing through all these things... awaken, they see nothing because the dreams were noth- ing. It is thus that they who cast ignorance from them like sleep do not consider it to be anything, nor regard its properties to be something real, but they renounce them like a dream in the night and they consider the knowledge of the father to be the dawn. It is thus that each has acted, as if asleep, during the time of igno- rance, and thus a person comes to understand, as if awakening. And happy is one who comes to himself and awakens. Indeed, blessings on one who has opened the eyes of the blind. God's face is sweet and his will is good. God gives his aroma to the light, which the spirit smells. God's presence is deeply joyous and sensual: \"He brought the warm fullness of love, so that the cold may not return, but the unity of the perfect thought may prevail.\" The agent of human return is the son. The father exists in the saved and they exist in the father. Such is the place of the blessed:\" They are in that true and eternal life and speak of the perfect light filled with the seed of the father, and which is in his heart and in the fullness.\" The Gospel of Truth is an exhortation of truth, a sermon of hope. We hear again and again the cheerful, intellectual message of knowledge that dissolves darkness: What, then, is that which he wants such a one to think? \"I am like the shadows and phantoms of the night.\" When morning comes, this one knows that the fear that had been experienced was nothing."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"242 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM THE GOSPEL OF TRUTH 1 JOY TO THOSE WHO KNOW THE FATHER The gospel of truth is joy for those who have received from the father of truth the grace of knowing him by the power of the word, 2 who has come from the fullness 3 and who is in the thought and the mind of the father. This is the one who is called the savior, since that is the name of the work that he must do for the redemption of those who have not known the father. For the name of the gospel is the revelation of hope, since that is the discovery of those who seek him, because the realm of all sought him from whom it came.

IGNORANCE OF THE FATHER BRINGS ERROR This ignorance of the father brought about terror and fear. 4 And terror be- came dense like a fog, so no one was able to see. Because of this, error 5 became strong. But she worked on her material substance 6 vainly, because she did not know the truth. She assumed a fashioned figure while she was preparing, in power and in beauty, the substitute for truth. This, then, was not a humiliation for the illimitable, inconceivable one. For they were as nothing, this terror and this forgetfulness and this figure of falsehood, whereas established truth is unchanging, unperturbed, and com- pletely beautiful.

As one of whom some have no knowl- edge, he wants them to know him and love him. What did they lack, if not the knowledge of the father? 14 JESUS AS QUIET GUIDE Jesus became a guide, quiet and at leisure. In the middle of a school he came and spoke the word, as a teacher. Those who were wise in their own estimation came to put him to the test. But he discredited them as empty-headed people. They hated him because they really were not wise. After all these came also the little children, those who possess the knowledge of the father. When they be- came strong they were taught the aspects of the father's face. They came to know and they were known. They were glorified and they gave glory. THE LIVING BOOK IN THE HEART OF THE LITTLE CHILDREN In their heart, the living book of the living was manifest, the book that was written in the thought and in the mind of the father and, from before the foundation of all, is in that incomprehensible part of him. 15 This is the book that no one found possible to take, since it was reserved for him who will take it and be slain. No one could appear among those who be- lieved in salvation as long as that book had not appeared. For this reason, the compassionate, faithful Jesus was patient in his sufferings until he took that book, since he knew that his death meant life for many. 16 Just as in the case of a will that has not yet been opened, the fortune of the deceased master of the house is hidden, so also in the case of all that had been hidden as long as the father of all was invisible and unique in himself, in whom every space has its source. For this reason Jesus appeared. He put on that book. He was nailed to a cross. He affixed the edict of the father to the cross. Oh, such great teaching!

Having entered into the empty territory of fears, he passed before those who were stripped by forgetfulness, being both knowledge and perfection, proclaiming the things that are in the heart of the father, so that he became the wisdom of those who have received instruction. But those who are to be taught, the living who are inscribed in the book of the living, learn for them- selves, receiving instructions from the father, turning to him again. 18 Since the perfection of all is in the father, it is necessary for all to ascend to him. Therefore, if one has knowledge, he gets what belongs to him and draws it to himself. For one who is ignorant is deficient, and it is a great deficiency, since he lacks that which will make him perfect. Since the perfection of all is in the father, it is necessary for all to ascend to him and for each one to get the things that are his. He wrote these things first, having prepared them to be given to those who came from him. THE FATHER CALLING THOSE WHO HAVE KNOWLEDGE Those whose names he knew first were called last, so that the one who has knowledge is one whose name the father has pronounced. 19 For one whose name has not been spoken is ignorant. Indeed, how shall one hear if a name has not been uttered? For whoever remains ignorant until the end is a creature of forgetfulness and will perish with it. If this is not so, why have these wretches no name, why have they no voice? Hence, whoever has knowledge is from above. If called, that person hears, replies, and turns toward him who called. That person ascends to him and knows how he is called. Having knowl- edge, that person does the will of him who called. That person desires to please him, finds rest, 20 and receives a certain name. Those who thus are going to have knowledge know whence they came and whither they are going. They know it as someone who, having become intoxicated, has turned from his drunkenness and, having come to himself, has restored what is his own. 21 18.

For he revealed it as a knowledge with which all its emana- tions agree, namely, the knowledge of the living book that he revealed to the eternal beings at last as his letters, displaying to them that these are not merely vowels or consonants, so that one may read them and think of some- thing void of meaning.

After he had filled what was incomplete, he did away with its form. The form of that which was incomplete is the world, which it served. For where there is envy and strife, there is an incompleteness; 25 but where there is unity, there is completeness. Since this incompleteness came about because they did not know the father, from the moment when they know the father, incompleteness will cease to exist. As one's ignorance disappears when one gains knowledge, and as darkness disappears when light appears, so also incompleteness is eliminated by completeness. Certainly, from that moment on, form is no longer manifest but will be dissolved in fusion with unity. Now their works lie scattered. In time unity will make the spaces complete.

By means of knowledge one will purify himself from multiplicity into unity, devouring matter within him- self like fire and darkness by light, death by life.

Nevertheless, the householder does not suffer a loss but rejoices, for in the place of these defective dishes there are those that are completely perfect. For this is the judgment that has come from above and that has judged every person, a drawn two-edged sword cutting on this side and that. 26 When the word appeared, who is in the heart of those who pronounce it—it was not merely a sound but has become a body—a great dis- turbance occurred among the dishes, for some were emptied, others filled; some were provided for, others were removed; some were purified, still others were broken.

His tongue is the holy spirit. Whoever touches truth touches the mouth of the father by his tongue at the time when one will receive the holy spirit. This is the manifestation of the father and his revelation to his eternal be- ings. He revealed what is hidden in him and explained it. For who is it who ex- ists if it is not the father himself? All the spaces are his emanations. They knew that they stem from him as children from a perfect man. They knew that they had not yet received form, nor had they yet received a name, every one of which the father produces. If they at that time receive the form of his knowl- edge, though they are truly in him, they do not know him. 27 But the father is perfect. He knows every space that is within him. If he pleases, 28 he reveals anyone whom he desires by giving him a form and by giving him a name; and he does give a name and cause to come into being. Those who do not yet exist are ignorant of him who created them. I do not say, then, that those who do not yet exist are nothing. 29 But they are in him who will desire that they exist when he pleases, like an event that is going to happen. On the one hand, he knows, before anything is revealed, what he will produce. On the other hand, the fruit that has not yet been revealed does not know anything nor is any- thing either. Thus each space that, on its part, is in the father comes from the existent one, who, on his part, has established it from the nonexistent. For whoever has no root has no fruit, but although thinking, \"I have come into being,\" that one will perish. For this reason, whoever does not exist at all will never exist. 27. Layton, Gnostic Scriptures, 258, punctuates differently. Thus the text could read as follows: \"It is when they receive the form of his knowledge that the father produces them.

They are involved in inflicting blows, or they themselves receive bruises. They are falling from high places, or they fly through the air with no wings at all. Other times, it is as if certain people were trying to kill them, even though there is no one pursuing them; or they themselves are killing those beside them, and they are stained by their blood. Until the moment when they who are passing through all these things—I mean they who have experi- enced all these confusions—awaken, they see nothing because the dreams were nothing.

He saved the life of that sheep, bringing it up from the pit that you may understand fully what that Sabbath is, you who are the children of the under- standing of the heart. 43 It is a day in which it is not fitting that salvation be idle, so that you may speak of that heavenly day that has no night and of the sun that does not set because it is perfect. Say then in your heart that you are this perfect day and that in you lives the light that does not fail. PUTTING KNOWLEDGE INTO PRACTICE Speak concerning the truth to those who seek it and of knowledge to those who, in their error, have committed sins. 44 Make sure-footed those who stum- ble, and stretch forth your hands to the sick. Nourish the hungry, and set at ease those who are troubled. Raise up and awaken those who sleep. You are this understanding that seizes you. 45 If the strong follow this course, they are even stronger. Turn your attention to yourselves. Do not be concerned with other things, namely, that which you have cast forth from yourselves, that which you have dismissed. Do not return to them to eat them. Do not be moth-eaten. Do not be worm-eaten, for you have already shaken it off. Do not be a place of the devil, for you have already destroyed him. Do not strengthen your last obstacles, because that is reprehensible. For the lawless one is noth- ing. He harms himself more than the law. For that one does his works because he is a lawless person. But this one, because he is a righteous person, does his works among others. Do the will of the father, then, for you are from him.

For example, the hunger to be satisfied may be physical hunger or spiritual hunger. 45- Or, more abstractly, \"encourages.\""},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"252 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM that are yours, 46 that they are the children of the father, and one knows his aroma, that you originate from the grace of his countenance. For this reason, the father loves his aroma; and it manifests itself in every place; and when it is mixed with matter, he gives his aroma to the light; and into his rest he causes it to ascend in every form and in every sound. For it is not ears that smell the aroma, but it is the spirit that possesses the sense of smell and draws it for it- self to itself and sinks into the aroma of the father. Thus the spirit cares for it and takes it to the place from which it has come, the first aroma, which has grown cold. It is in a psychical form, resembling cold water 47 that has sunk into soil that is not hard, of which those who see it think, \"It is earth.\" After- ward, it evaporates if a breath of wind draws it, and it becomes warm. The cold aromas, then, are from division. For this reason, faith came and destroyed di- vision and brought the warm fullness of love, so that the cold may not return, but the unity of perfect thought may prevail. 48 THE FATHER RESTORES DEFICIENCY WITH FULLNESS This is the word of the gospel about finding the fullness for those who wait for the salvation that comes from above. When their hope, for which they are wait- ing, is waiting—they whose likeness is the light in which there is no shadow— then at that time the fullness is about to come. The deficiency of matter, however, is not because of the infinity of the father, who came to give time to deficiency. In fact, it is not right to say that the incorruptible one will come in this manner. The depth of the father is profound, and the thought of error is not with him. It is a matter of falling down and a matter of being readily set upright at the discovery of the one who has come to what he would bring back. 49 This bringing back is called repentance. For this reason, incorruption has breathed. It followed one who has sinned, in order that he may find rest. For- giveness is that which remains for the light in the deficiency, the word of the fullness. For the doctor hurries to the place where there is sickness, because 46. Matthew 7:16; 12:33; Luke 6:44. 47. The author is employing a pun (in Greek) by comparing psyche (soul, psychical form) and psychos (cold). 48.

The translation is difficult here, but it seems to mean that repentance is the discovery of what may be brought back to heal a person, namely, knowledge."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM 253 that is the doctor's wish. The sick person is in a deficient condition but does not hide, because the doctor possesses what the patient lacks. In this manner the deficiency is filled by the fullness, which has no deficiency, and which was given in order to fill the one deficient, so that the person may receive grace. For while deficient, this person had no grace. Because of this a diminishing occurred where there is no grace. When the diminished part was restored, the person in need revealed himself as fullness. This is what it means to find the light of truth that has shone toward the person: it is unchangeable. ANOINTING THE CHOSEN WITH THE FATHER'S MERCY For this reason they who have been troubled speak about Christ 50 in their midst so that they may receive restoration and he may anoint them with the ointment. The ointment is the pity of the father, who will have mercy on them. But those whom he has anointed are those who are perfect. For filled vessels are usually coated with sealing wax. 51 But when the coating is ruined, the ves- sel may leak, and the cause of its defect is the lack of coating. For then a breath of wind and the power that it has can make it evaporate. But from the jar that is without defect no seal is removed, nor does it leak. But what it lacks is filled again by the perfect father. The father is good. He knows his plantings because he is the one who has planted them in his paradise. And his paradise is his place of rest. THE FATHER IS BEGINNING AND END Paradise is the perfection in the thought of the father, and the plants are the words of his reflection. Each one of his words is the work of his will alone, in the revelation of his word. Since they were in the depth of his mind, the word, 52 who was the first to come forth, caused them to appear, along with an intellect that speaks the unique word by means of a silent grace. It was called thought, since they were in it before becoming manifest. 53 It happened, then, 50. The anointed. 51. The suggestion of this translation comes from Layton, Gnostic Scriptures, 262. 52.

Nothing happens without him, nor does anything occur without the will of the father. But his will is incomprehensible. His will is his footstep, 54 but no one can know it, nor is it possible for them to concentrate on it in order to possess it. But that which he wishes takes place at the moment he wishes it—even if the view does not please people before god: it is the father's will. For the father knows the beginning of them all as well as their end. For when their end arrives, he will greet them. The end, you see, is the recognition of him who is hidden, that is, the father, from whom the beginning came forth and to whom will return all who have come from him. For they were made manifest for the glory and the joy of his name. THE SON IS THE NAME AND REVELATION OF THE FATHER The name of the father is the son. It is he who, in the beginning, gave a name to him who came from him, while he remained the same, and he conceived him as a son. He gave him his name, which belonged to him—he, the father, who possesses everything that exists around him. He possesses the name; he has the son. It is possible for the son to be seen. The name, however, is invisible, for it alone is the mystery of the invisible about to come to ears completely filled with it through the father's agency. Moreover, as for the father, his name is not pronounced but is revealed through a son. Thus, then, the name is great. 55 Who, then, has been able to pronounce a name for him, this great name, except him alone to whom the name belongs and the children of the name, in whom the name of the father is at rest, and who themselves in turn are at rest in his name, since the father has no beginning? 56 It is he alone who conceived it for himself as a name, in the beginning before he had created the eternal be- ings, that the name of the father should be supreme over them—that is, the true name, which is secure by his authority and by his perfect power. For the name is not drawn from lexicons, nor is his name derived from common name-giving. It is invisible. The father alone gave the son a name, because he alone saw him and because he alone was capable of giving him a name. For 54. \"Footstep\" here carries the sense of identifying him, marking him. 55.

For what name would one give him who did not exist? Nevertheless, he who exists exists also with his name, and he alone knows it, and to him alone the father gave a name. He is the father, his name is the son. He did not, therefore, keep it secretly hidden, but it came into existence, and the son himself disclosed the name. The name, then, is that of the father, just as the name of the father is the beloved son. For otherwise, where would he find a name except from the father? But someone will proba- bly say to a friend, \"Who would give a name to someone who existed before himself, as if, indeed, children did not receive their name from one of those who gave them birth?\" Above all, then, it is fitting for us to think this point over: what is the name? This is the true name, the name that came from the father, for it is he who owns the name. He did not, you see, get the name on loan, as in the case of others, who receive names that are made up. This is the proper name. There is no one else to whom he has given it. It remained unnamed, unuttered, till the moment when he who is perfect pronounced it himself; and it was he alone who was able to pronounce his name and to see it. When it pleased the father, then, that his son should be his pronounced name, and when he who has come from the depth disclosed this name, he divulged what was hidden, because he knew that the father was absolute goodness. For this reason, indeed, the father brought this particular one forth, that he might speak concerning the realm and his place of rest from which he had come forth, and that he might glorify the full- ness, the greatness of his name and the sweetness of the father. THE PLACE OF THE BLESSED Each one will speak concerning the place from which they have come forth, and to the region from which they received their essential being they will has- ten to return once again and receive from that place, the place where they stood before, and they will taste of that place, be nourished, and grow. And their own place of rest is their fullness. 57 All the emanations from the father, therefore, are fullnesses, and all his emanations have their roots in the one who caused them all to grow from himself. He assigned their destinies. They, then, became manifest individually that they might be perfected in their own thought, for that place to which they extend their thought is their root, which 57.

For neither have they exalted themselves nor have they diminished the glory of the father, nor have they thought of him as small, nor bitter, nor angry, but as ab- solutely good, unperturbed, sweet, knowing all the spaces before they came into existence and having no need of instruction. Such are they who possess from above something of this immeasurable greatness, as they strain toward that unique and perfect One who exists there for them. 58 And they do not go down to Hades. 59 They have neither envy nor moaning, nor is death in them.

They lack nothing in any way, but they are given rest and are refreshed by the spirit. And they listen to their root; they are busy with concerns in which one will find his root, and one will suffer no loss to his soul. 60 Such is the place of the blessed; this is their place. As for the others, then, may they know, in their place, that it does not suit me, after having been in the place of rest, to say anything more. 61 It is there I shall dwell in order to devote myself, at all times, to the father of all and the true friends, 62 those upon whom the love of the father is lavished, and in whose midst nothing of him is lacking. It is they who manifest themselves truly, since they are in that true and eternal life and speak of the perfect light filled with the seed of the father, which is in his heart and in the fullness, while his spirit rejoices in it and glo- rifies him in whom it was, because the father is good.

Only at the end are some themes developed at length. The Gospel of Philip contains a gnostic exegesis of some New Testament passages; deals with Valentinian notions of life, death, and resurrection, and flesh and spirit; and centers on one side of Christian tradition, the sacraments. The sacraments include baptism, chrism (a form of anointing with olive oil), the eucharist, redemption, and the bridal chamber. Originally Adam and Eve were joined as an androgynous figure, the text points out. Problems of sexual- ity and other sicknesses came about when this union was broken. With Christ's aid, the reunion takes place in the bridal chamber. This reunion is a precursor to the later union when the spirit returns to the heavenly realm. The notion of a chaste union in the bed, when one is clothed in protective light of the spirit, goes through many poems: The rulers do not see you who wear the perfect light, and they cannot seize you. You put on the light in the mystery of union. Other themes concern free men and virgins, slaves, defiled women, animals in human form, conversion, and agriculture. As in the canonical gospels, the parable themes embrace sowing, reaping, and the seasons.

One 29 was engendered in adultery, since he was the child of the serpent. 30 So like his father he too became a murderer and killed his brother. Every sexual act between unlike persons is adultery.

But let the others yearn just to listen to her voice and to enjoy her fragrant ointments, and let them feed on the crumbs falling from the table, like dogs. Bridegrooms and brides belong to the bridal chamber. No one shall be able to see the bridegroom or bride unless one becomes a bridegroom or bride.

He was called the greatest system- atic theologian of the school. He was also an allegorical exegete of the Gospel of John. Ptolemy's letter is addressed to \"dear sister Flora,\" Flora presumably being an educated Christian woman who will receive the theolo- gian's lessons on questions of Mosaic law. After the salutation, however, there is no indication that Flora is a real person. She may represent the Christian church in Rome or simply individual Christian readers who may be per- suaded by the broader speculation of a Valentinian gnostic. The letter speaks, especially at the be ginning, as a fellow Christian mak- ing distinctions between the validity of the law in the Hebrew Bible—origi- nally designed for the Jews, who could not abide by pure law—and the New Testament. Eventually the path of instruction leads to a strong endorsement of the gnostic perfect god over his biblical adversary, who is the maker of the universe and the demiurge. The savior came to earth, it becomes clear, to complete his spiritual regeneration. He was not a messenger of the creator god but an emanation of the father of all. Throughout the persuasive letter, however, the author presents Valentinian gnostic ideas as completely concor- dant with Christianity.

There is the pure law of god in the form of the ten"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"300 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM commandments (which the savior came to fulfill, not to destroy); Moses' own additions to the law; and the additions by the elders. The latter two parts were mixed with impure and evil law, which was a compromise necessary to control the people before the advent of New Testament rigor. These lapses in law were made with regard to \"hard-hearted divorce,\" revenge killing, and all other in- justices. For his part, the savior Jesus altered the commands on offerings, cir- cumcision, fasting, and the Passover unleavened bread. The new law takes commands to a spiritual level. Following Paul, one should have circumcision not of the flesh but of the spiritual heart. Ptolemy's exegesis of Christian law was certainly already clear in Paul's changes and the New Testament itself, but now it is presented in a way to show that pure law derives not from the perfect god but from the demiurge, the creator god of the Bible. The god of the Bible, however, is presented not entirely as a narrow, angry god of the Jews, but as a middle deity between the perfect, ungenerated god and the devil. That god of the law, who is still in the Christian province, is the arbitrator of justice, which depends on him. But he is inferior to the perfect god, as his justice is lower. His world is cor- ruption, darkness, and the material, while the god of all is incorruption and self-existent light. Finally, the savior is with the perfect god. We read, \"The substance of the latter [the god of all] produced a double power, while the savior is an image of the greater one.\" At the conclusion, the writer of the didactic letter returns to the reader, telling her personally, \"These points will be of great benefit to you in the fu- ture, if like fair and good ground you have received fertile seeds and go on to show forth their fruit.\" The Letter to Flora is a letter to convert.

I think that this will be perfectly clear to you when you have learned the contradictory opinions about it. Some say that it is legislation given by god the father of all; others, taking the contrary course, maintain stubbornly that it was ordained by the opposite, the devil who causes destruction, just as they attribute the fashioning of the world to him, saying that he is the father and maker of this universe. Both are completely in error; they refute each other, and neither has reached the truth of the matter.For it is evident that the law was not ordained by the perfect god the father, for it is secondary, being imperfect and in need of completion by another, containing commandments alien to the nature and thought of such a god. On the other hand, one cannot impute the law to the injustice of the ad- versary, 2 for it is opposed to injustice. Such persons do not comprehend what was said by the savior. \"For a house or city divided against itself cannot stand,\" declared our savior. 3 Furthermore, the messenger 4 says that the creation of the world is due to him, for \"everything was made through him and apart from him nothing was made.\" 5 Thus he takes away in advance the baseless wisdom of the false accus- ers and shows that the creation is due not to a god who corrupts but to the one who is just and hates evil. Only unintelligent people have this idea, people who do not recognize the providence of the creator and have blinded not only the eye of the soul but also the eye of the body. From what has been said, it is evident that these persons entirely miss the truth; each of the two groups has experienced this, the first because they do not know the god of justice, the second because they do not know the father of all, who was revealed by him alone who came and who knew him. It remains for us who have been counted worthy of the knowledge of both of these to provide you with an accurate explanation of the nature of the law and of the legislator by whom it was ordained. We shall draw the proofs of what we say from the words of the savior, which alone can lead us without error to the comprehension of reality. THE THREEFOLD SOURCES OF THE LAW First, you must learn that the entire law contained in the Pentateuch of Moses was not ordained by one legislator, I mean, not by god alone; some 2. Satan. 3. Matthew 12:25. 4. Or \"apostle,\" here probably John. 5. John 1:3."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"302 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM commandments are Moses', and some were given by men. The words of the savior teach us this triple division. The first part must be attributed to god himself and his legislating, the second to Moses—not in the sense that god legislates through him, but in the sense that Moses gave some legislation under the influence of his own ideas—and the third to the elders of the people, who seem to have ordained some commandments of their own at the beginning. You will now learn how the truth of this theory is proved by the words of the savior. In some discussion with those who disputed with the savior about divorce, which was permitted in the law, he said, \"Because of your hard- heartedness Moses permitted a man to divorce his wife; from the beginning it was not so; for god made this marriage, and what the lord joined together, man must not separate.\" 6 In this way he shows that there is a law of god, which prohibits the divorce of a wife from her husband, and another law, that of Moses, which permits the breaking of this yoke because of hard- heartedness. In fact, Moses lays down legislation contrary to that of god; for joining is contrary to not joining. But if we examine the intention of Moses in giving this legislation, it will be seen that he did not give it arbitrarily or of his own accord, but by necessity because of the weakness of those for whom the legislation was given. Since they were unable to keep the intention of god, according to which it was not lawful for them to reject their wives, with whom some of them disliked to live, and therefore were in danger of turning to greater injustice and thence to destruction, Moses wanted to remove the cause of dislike, which was placing them in jeopardy of destruction. There- fore because of the critical circumstances, choosing a lesser evil in place of a greater, he ordained, of his own accord, a second law, that of divorce, so that if they could not observe the first, they might keep this and not turn to unjust and evil actions, through which complete destruction would be the result for them. This was his intention when he gave legislation contrary to that of god. Therefore it is indisputable that here the law of Moses is different from the law of god, even if we have demonstrated the fact from only one example. The savior also makes plain the fact that some traditions of the elders are interwoven with the law. \"For god said,\" he states, '\"Honor your father and your mother, that it may be well with you.' But you have declared,\" he says, ad- dressing the elders, \"that what help you might have received from me is a gift 6. Matthew 19:8, 6."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM 303 to god; and you have nullified the law of god through the tradition of your eld- ers.\" 7 Isaiah also proclaimed this, saying, \"This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me, teaching precepts that are the command- ments of men.\" 8 THE TRIPARTITE LAW OF GOD Therefore it is obvious that the whole law is divided into three parts; we find in it the legislation of Moses, of the elders, and of god himself. This division of the entire law, as made by us, has brought to light what is true in it. This part, the law of god himself, is in turn divided into three parts: the pure legislation not mixed with evil, which is properly called law, which the savior came not to destroy but to complete 9 —for what he completed was not alien to him but needed completion, for it did not possess perfection—next, the legislation in- terwoven with inferiority and injustice, which the savior destroyed because it was alien to his nature; and finally, the legislation that is exemplary and sym- bolic, an image of what is spiritual and transcendent, which the savior trans- ferred from the perceptible and phenomenal to the spiritual and invisible. The law of god, pure and not mixed with inferiority, is the decalogue, those ten sayings engraved on two tables, forbidding things not to be done and en- joining things to be done. These contain pure but imperfect legislation and re- quired the completion made by the savior. There is also the law interwoven with injustice, laid down for vengeance and the requital of previous injuries, ordaining that an eye should be cut out for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, and that a murder should be avenged by a murder. The person who is the second one to be unjust is no less unjust than the first; he simply changes the order of events while performing the same action. Admittedly, this commandment was a just one and still is just, because of the weakness of those for whom the leg- islation was made so that they would not transgress the pure law. But it is alien to the nature and goodness of the father of all. No doubt it was appropriate to the circumstances, or even necessary. For he who does not want one murder committed, saying, \"You shall not kill,\" commands a murder to be repaid by another murder, and so he has given a second law, which enjoins two murders 7. Matthew 15:4-9. Ptolemy here cites Matthew's (and Jesus') discussion of whether there are occasions when one need not honor father and mother. 8. Isaiah 29:13. 9. Matthew 5:17."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"304 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM although he had forbidden one. This fact proves that he was unsuspectingly the victim of necessity. This is why, when his son came, he destroyed this part of the law while admitting that it came from god. He counts this part of the law as in the old religion, not only in other passages but also where he said, \"God said, 'He who curses father or mother shall surely die.' \" 10 Finally, there is the exemplary part, ordained in the image of spiritual and transcendent matters; I mean the part dealing with offerings and circumcision and the Sabbath and fasting and Passover and unleavened bread and other similar matters. Since all these things are images and symbols, when the truth was made manifest they were translated to another meaning. In their phe- nomenal appearance and their literal application they were destroyed, but in their spiritual meaning they were restored; the names remained the same, but the content was changed. Thus the savior commanded us to make offerings not of irrational animals or of incense of this worldly sort, but of spiritual praise and glorification and thanksgiving and of sharing and well-doing with our neighbors. He wanted us to be circumcised, not in regard to our physical foreskin but in regard to our spiritual heart; to keep the Sabbath, for he wishes us to be idle in regard to evil works; to fast, not in physical fasting but in spir- itual, in which there is abstinence from everything evil. 11 Among us external fasting is also observed, since it can be advantageous to the soul if it is done reasonably, not for imitating others or from habit or because of a special day appointed for this purpose. It is also observed so that those who are not yet able to keep the true fast may have a reminder of it from the external fast. Sim- ilarly, Paul the messenger shows that the Passover and the unleavened bread are images when he says, \"Christ our Passover has been sacrificed, in order that you may be unleavened bread, not containing leaven\"—by leaven he here means evil—\"but may be a new batch of dough.\" 12 Thus the law of god itself is obviously divided into three parts. The first was completed by the savior, for the commandments, You shall not kill, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not swear falsely, are included in the for- bidding of anger, desire, and swearing. The second part was entirely destroyed. For an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, interwoven with injustice and itself a work of injustice, was destroyed by the savior through its opposite. 10. Matthew 15:4, citing Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9. 11.

For the images and symbols that represent other things were good as long as the truth had not come; but since the truth has come, we must perform the actions of the truth, not those of the image. The students of the savior and the messenger Paul showed that this the- ory is true, speaking of the part dealing with images, as we have already said, in mentioning the Passover for us and the unleavened bread; of the law inter- woven with injustice when he says that \"the law of commandments in ordi- nances was destroyed\" 14 ; and of that not mixed with anything inferior when he says that \"the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.\" 15 I think I have shown you sufficiently, as well as one can in brief compass, the addition of human legislation in the law and the triple division of the law of god itself. THE LAW IS BY THE DEMIURGE It remains for us to say who this god is who ordained the law; but I think this too has been shown you in what we have already said, if you have listened to it attentively. For if the law was not ordained by the perfect god himself, as we have already taught you, nor by the devil, a statement one cannot possibly make, the legislator must be someone other than these two. In fact, he is the demiurge and maker of this universe and everything in it; and because he is essentially different from these two and is between them, he is rightly de- scribed as intermediate. And if the perfect god is good by nature, as in fact he is, for our savior de- clared that there is only a single good god, his father whom he manifested; 16 and if the one who is of the opposite nature is evil and wicked, characterized by injustice; then the one situated between the two, neither good nor evil and unjust, can properly be called just, since he is the arbitrator of the justice that depends on him. On the one hand, this god will be inferior to the perfect god 13. Matthew 5:39. 14. Ephesians 2:15. 15. Romans 7:12. 16. See Matthew 19:17, on one good god."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"306 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM and lower than his justice, since he is generated and not ungenerated; there is only one ungenerated father, from whom are all things, 17 since all things depend on him in their own ways. On the other hand, he will be greater and more powerful than the adversary, by nature, because he has a substance and na- ture different from the substance of either of them. The substance of the ad- versary is corruption and darkness, for he is material and complex, while the substance of the ungenerated father of all is incorruption and self-existent light, simple and homogeneous. The substance of the latter produced a dou- ble power, while the savior is an image of the greater one. Do not let this trouble you for the present in your desire to learn how from one first principle of all, simple, and acknowledged by us and believed by us, ungenerated and incorruptible and good, were constituted these natures of corruption and the middle, which are of different substances, although it is characteristic of the good to generate and produce things that are like itself and have the same substance. For, if god permit, you will later learn about their origin and generation, when you are judged worthy of the apostolic tra- dition that we too have received by succession. We too are able to prove all our points by the teaching of the savior.

But Christian authority viewed gnosticism as an impossible and dangerous heresy and refused to compromise. Refuted by Origen in great detail, Herakleon's analyses and allegorical interpretations were nevertheless so important that they served as a model for the famous theologian's own exegetical methods: Origen, too, became famous for his ex- egesis of the Gospel of John. In this respect he was like other major theolo- gians, such as Clement of Alexandria, who were profoundly imbued with the thought and reasoning of their opponents.

Yet even here he refrains, probably because of the intended audience, from going into the esoteric mythopoetic structure of the Valentinian cosmos, with its tales of Sophia and other principle eternal beings (aeons) in the full- ness (pleroma). Herakleon focuses both on the nature of the savior and on those who have accepted and denied him. Jesus is accepted as the anointed (Christ, messiah) by some Jews, whom we now call Christians, and not by other Jews. He informs us that the Jews of the New Testament (by this he is excluding Jesus' followers and Jesus himself) are even seen as not descended from the patriarch Abraham but as descendants of the devil, and he cites John 8:44, \"You are from your father the devil.\" \"They are neither children of Abraham nor children of god, because they do not love Jesus.\" They are from the demiurge, the biblical creator god. At this point he moves into the crucial area of Christian and Christian- gnostic thought and confusion—who is this Jesus? The orthodox views of the church father Justin (or Justin Martyr, as he is conventionally known) that \"Jesus Christ alone really was born as the son of god\" l and of Irenaeus that \"god was made man\" 2 contrast with the gnostic view that Christ was not a human. In her Johannine Gospel in Gnostic Exegesis, Elaine Pagels compares Christian belief and gnostic heterdoxy: Heracleon claims, for example, that those who insist that Jesus, a man who lived \"in the flesh,\" is \"Christ\" fail to distinguish be- tween literal and symbolic truth. Those who write accounts of the revelation as alleged biographies of \"Jesus of Nazareth\"—or even of Jesus as messiah—focus on mere historical \"externals\" and miss the inner truth they signify. 3 Herakleon saw the view of an earthly Jesus as an error of the flesh in which un- denied historical data pass for spiritual truth when such events have been re- ally just earthly reflections of a divine reality whose appearance of corporality was pure illusion. The word was not made real flesh in the instance of Jesus Christ. The word was made image, a simulacrum of the flesh. 1. Justin, First Apology 21. 2. Irenaeus, Against Heresies 3.2.1. 3.

The material people worship the demiurge, who made the earth and flesh; the psychical people also worship the demiurge and god as Jesus in the flesh. They all miss what the spiritual people apprehend, which is the higher father of truth, or whatever of the many names the transcendent gnostic deity is given. In disputing the nature of reality that the other Christians perceive, Herakleon is not suggesting that Jesus did not exist or that the events recounted in the gospels were false. They did take place, yet their meaning is not the apparent historical meaning but an image of the inner meaning, of a higher reality. Through knowledge, the spiritual one comes upon and participates in that higher reality, which is the gnostic deity. Sometimes the elect are unaware of their spiritual, pneumatic level and can falter: the gnostics tended to ascribe such ignorance to error rather than moral sin. The true gnostics understand the symbolic meaning of the images in the world, and turn inward to look for the indescribable and secret forces of the divine. COMMENTARY ON JOHN 4 (1) John 1:3 Through the word everything came to be, and without the word nothing came to be. Everything is the world and what is in the world, but the aeon and what is in the aeon was not born through the word. Nothing is what is in the world and the creation. Who provided the cause of the generation of the world to the demiurge was the word, who is not the one from or by whom but through whom the world was generated. The word did not create as if he were given energy by another, but while he was providing energy, another, the demiurge, created. In that sense the world was generated through the word. 4.

I cannot account for or describe or explain the dis- pensation of this flesh. The world is the sandal. The demiurge of the world, 11 who is inferior to Christ, acknowledges these facts in this passage. (9) John 1:28 All this happened in Bethany across the Jordan.

As a prophet John said \"lamb of god.\" As more than a prophet, 12 he also said \"who takes away the wrong of the world.\" The first expression refers to Christ's body, the second one to him who was in the body. As the lamb is imperfect in the genus of sheep, so the body is imperfect compared to him who inhabits the body. If he had wished to ascribe perfection to the body, he would have spo- ken of a ram that was to be sacrificed. (11) John 2:12 After this he went down to Capernaum. Here too the passage signifies the beginning of another dispensation, since \"he went down\" was not spoken without purpose. Capernaum means both the ends of the world and the material things to which he descended. Because to him this was an alien place, nothing is noted as having been done or said there. (12) John 2:13 It was almost the Passover of the Jews. The great feast was a symbol of the passion of the savior, when the sheep not only was slain but, when eaten, gave rest.

In the temple he found the people selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the coin changers sitting there. He made a whip out of ropes and drove out all the animals, the sheep and the oxen. The ascent to Jerusalem signifies the ascent of the lord from material things to the psychical place, which is an image of Jerusalem. 13 He found them in the innermost holy place, not in the temple courtyard, so one might think that a simple calling, even when not from the spirit, is helped by the lord. The holy place is the holy of holies in which only the high priest enters, 14 and where the spiritual people come. But the court of the temple, where the Levites also are, is a symbol of the psychical people outside the pleroma, who are found to be in salvation. Those who are there in the holy space selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers sitting there, are those who offer nothing freely but look at the coming of strangers to the temple as an occasion for trade and gain, and because of their profit and love of money supply the sac- rifices for worshiping god. The whip that Jesus made of small cords is an image of power and energy of the holy spirit, blowing away the wicked. The whip and the linen 15 and the winding sheet 16 and other such things are also an image of the power and energy of the holy spirit. The whip was tied on wood, and this wood was a symbol of the cross. On this wood the gambling mer- chants and wickedness 17 were nailed and destroyed. The whip was made of these two substances. Jesus did not make it of dead leather, since he wished to build the church no longer as a den of thieves and merchants but as a house of his father. (14) John 2:17 Zeal for your house will consume me. These words were spoken from the mouth of those powers cast out and con- sumed by the savior. 13. Here the entry of Jesus into the temple is interpreted as the ascent from the material and the attainment of salvation. The three Valentinian divisions of humanity are assumed.

Solomon's constructing the temple in forty-six years is an image of the savior.

That well signified weak, temporary, and deficient life and its glory. It was lim- ited to being worldly. This is proved by the fact that Jacob's cattle drank from it. But the water that the savior gave is of his spirit and power. \"You will not be thirsty forevermore,\" for his life is eternal and will never perish like the first water from the well. It is permanent. The grace and gift of our savior are not taken away or consumed or defiled by whoever shares in them.

This is the Samaritan woman's mingling with the pleroma. Coming with her husband to the savior, she might receive from him power, union, and mingling with pleroma. He was not speaking to her about an earthly husband and telling her to call him, because he knew that she didn't have a lawful husband. The savior said to her, \"Call your husband and come back here,\" meaning her fellow or husband 21 from the pleroma. As for what was meant allegorically, she did not know her own husband. Simply put, she was ashamed to admit that she had an adulterer, not a husband. \"You are right to say, I have no husband,\" since in the world the Samaritan woman had no husband, for her husband was in the aeon. The six husbands signify all the material evil to which she was bound and with which she consorted when she was irrationally debauched, insulted, refused, and abandoned by them. (19) John 4:19-20 Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our parents worshiped on this mountain. The Samaritan properly acknowledged what was said to her. Typically only a prophet knows all such things. She acted as appropriate to her ways, neither lying nor openly acknowledging her immorality. Certain that he was a prophet, she asked him about it while she revealed the cause of her sexual ac- tivity. Because of her ignorance of god she had neglected his worship and all that was necessary in her life. She would not have come to the well outside the city unless she had desired to learn how, and for whom, and by worshiping god she might escape from her sexual acts. So she said, \"Our parents wor- shiped on this mountain.\" (20) John 4:21 Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when not on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the father.

As Peter teaches, \"We must not worship in the Greek manner, accepting the works of matter and worshiping wood and stone, or in the Jewish manner worship the divine.

In terms of what was meant allegorically, salvation came from the Jews because they are regarded as images of beings in the pleroma.

Having gone down to the sick man and healed him of the disease, that is, of his sins, and having made him alive through remission, he said, \"Your son lives.\" \"The man believed\" because the demiurge can easily believe that the savior is able to heal even when he is not present.

The Valentinian Treatise on Resurrection offers a spiritual under- standing of resurrection that picks up ideas from Paul's letters (see 1 Corinthi- ans 15, for example) but parts company with Paul and his followers on several significant matters. The author of the treatise, rejecting a literal interpretation of the resurrection in favor of a spiritual understanding, emphasizes that the spiritual resurrection is no illusion. It is real and it is true, more real and true, in fact, than the material world. The author cites Paul approvingly as \"the mes- senger\" (or apostle), and states with Paul, \"We suffered with him [that is, Jesus], we arose with him, and we went to heaven with him.\" The author of the Trea- tise on Resurrection understands that suffering and death actually occur in this material world, and the author proposes, in contrast to Paul's more apocalyp- tic view, that resurrection is actually the transcending of the material world through the liberation of the spirit.

With a formu- lation reminiscent of Hindu and other statements, the Treatise on Resurrec- tion affirms that one may call the world of matter illusion, but the world of spirit, and the resurrection of the spirit, is truth. The Treatise on Resurrection is found in the Nag Hammadi library. It was composed in Greek by an unknown author who presents the treatise in the form of a letter to a certain Rheginos.

And let that philosopher here on earth not believe that he is returning to the self by himself, and because of faith. We have known the human son, and we believe that he rose from among the dead.

The living will die. How do they live in illusion? The rich become poor and kings are overthrown. All changes. The world is an illusion. Why do I seem to shout?

Further, the discussion of people being of three parts—body, soul, and spirit—is reminiscent of the threefold division of elemental stuff and of people in Valentinian thought.

The soul kills itself. 29 \"I tell you the truth, he will never forgive the sin of the soul or the guilt of the flesh, for none of those who have worn the flesh will be saved.

We knelt down, Peter and I, and gave thanks and sent our hearts up to heaven.

We saw with our eyes and heard with our ears hymns, angelic praises and angelic re- joicing. Heavenly majesties were singing hymns, and we rejoiced too. Again after this we wished to send our spirits up to the majesty. When we ascended, we were not allowed to see or hear anything. The other students called to us and asked us, \"What did you hear from the teacher? What did he tell you? Where did he go?\" We answered them, \"He ascended. He gave us his right hand, and promised all of us life. He showed us children coming after us, having commanded us to love them, since we are to be saved for their sakes.\" When they heard this, they believed the revelation, but they were angry about those who would be born.

The Round Dance of the Cross is followed in the Acts of John by the Revelation of the Mystery of the Cross (not translated here). Both have a distinctive character and a gnostic—even a Valentinian—flavor. The Round Dance of the Cross employs themes familiar from the tradition of John and the Gospel of John (for example, Jesus is the word of god who re- counts the mystery of suffering) within a hymn that is performed by Jesus and his followers. The hymn illustrates features familiar from gnostic texts; some scholars believe it may constitute a gnostic ritual in song and dance. The verses sung by Jesus the leader include self-declarations, some of which recall the riddlelike and paradoxical declarations of Thunder. The chorus of follow- ers responds to the leader's verses antiphonally by singing \"Amen\" and dance in a circle around him.

No more lyrically power- JL. ful and imaginative collection of poems exists in ancient religions. Their eclectic outsider's vision, the outrageously imaginative symbolism, the conversation with the soul and the divine, the passionate embrace of love, and the separation, search, and encounter with deity—all of these aspects make it a major volume of religious poetry: a book of light, knowledge, and the en- lightened voice. Until 1909 only five odes from this very important hymnbook were known. They appeared in the Pistis Sophia, a gnostic text preserved in Cop- tic. Then, in 1909, the archaeologist and Syriac scholar J. Rendel Harris dis- covered a four-hundred-year-old Syriac text of the collection. The original language of the songs was probably Greek, although some scholars argue for a Syriac original. Harris conjectured a Jewish-Christian origin from the first century CE. Others suggest a Jewish original with a Christian redaction. Wal- ter Bauer offers a third possibility, that the songs constitute a second-century gnostic hymnbook. Scholars disagree over how gnostic the Songs of Solomon really are. Many scholars, from Harris and Gunkel to Bultmann, Jonas, Grant, and Rudolph, take the songs to be gnostic, but others, such as Charlesworth, Chadwick, Burkitt, Braun, and Worrell, do not see them as fully gnostic. In his book The"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"358 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM Odes of Solomon, James Charlesworth argues that these songs are not gnostic but a mystical Jewish-Christian hymnbook, \"a tributary to Gnosticism which flows from Jewish apocalyptic mysticism.\" l Whatever the origin and degree of gnosticism, in their present form it is clear that the Songs of Solomon are based on Jewish sacred song tradition as exemplified in the Psalms and Song of Songs, that many of them have been subjected to a Christian overlay, and that their gnostic references are more significant than their mere inclusion in the Pistis Sophia. Harris also points out many quotations of the songs in the works of the early fathers of the church. The songs were of particular interest because of their christology, that is, the use of Christ as a speaker in the songs, and for their deep dependence on the Gospel of John, which is typical of many gnostic texts. Frequently, the structure of a song consists of a prologue on the part of the singer, then an oracular statement ex ore Christi, and finally a doxology in which the congre- gation is to participate. 2 In his study of the Songs of Solomon, Gerald Blasz- cak notes that they are composed largely in the first person singular as \"individual confession songs.\" 3 Many of these songs are hauntingly beautiful. The images soar. The diction is rich with surprising references, such as \"milk from the lord,\" which apolo- gists, dismayed by the female imagery for the divine, explain away as odd sym- bolism. Here are songs as poetic, profound, and astonishing as the most compelling songs and psalms of the Hebrew Bible. So we read: \"The dew of the lord rinsed me with silence and a cloud of peace rose over my head\" (Song 35); or, with typical chariot imagery of Jewish mysticism: \"I went up to the light of truth as into a chariot and truth took me across canyons and ravines\" (Song 38). The beautiful imagery encompasses Christian vocabulary as well: \"My heart was cloven and there appeared a flower, and grace sprang up\" (Song 11). The thought of all three prevailing traditions, Jewish, Christian, and gnos- tic, is suggested in Song 7: \"The father of knowledge is the word of knowledge. He who created wisdom is wiser than his works \" 1. Charlesworth, Odes of Solomon, p. 190. 2.

Presented in the Acts of Thomas as a hymn uttered by JL. Thomas, The Song of the Pearl is also a gnostic tale of salvation, of sleeping in error and awakening to light, of quest not only for the pearl but for the benefit of possessing the pearl: a return to the light. What is the pearl? As one of the alternative titles of the poem, \"The Hymn of the Soul,\" suggests, the pearl may esoterically be the soul. Or the pearl may be gnosis, the awakening, and the knowledge that the soul must have to move to the next level of being. Bentley Layton suggests that the prince and his quest may be the soul and its journey, the poem a tale of \"the soul's entry into bodily incarnation and its eventual disengagement from the body.\" 1 The soul on entering matter becomes inert, but once in possession of its pearl of knowledge it will waken into wisdom and reunion with \"the first principle.\" Giinther Bornkamm believes the young prince and savior to be Mani him- self, the founder of Manichaeism. The mysteries of interpretation fortu- nately are not fixed and apparent. Were the symbolic figures—a road, a coat, a serpent, a pearl, a wandering prince—easily decodable, the poem might be merely didactic. But the narrative is shot through with mysterious changes, dramatic turns and transformations that may be interpreted as theology only at risk of error. i.

On the surface the poem is simply an adventure. Yet everywhere in it are clues of other meanings. After all, serpents who sleep with pearls in their possession cannot but have an allegorical dimension. These symbols were used in Mandaean tra- ditional tales as well as in such gnostic works as the Pistis Sophia. Scholarship suggests that the main characters—the father, mother, and prince—form a gnostic trinity, equivalent to the Christian trinitarian formula. They may rep- resent the father of truth, the mother of wisdom, and the son. The son, who is redeemer and savior, is not Christ, however, or at least not primarily Christ. Hans Jonas identifies him with the Manichaean pre-cosmic human. The son has a double or twin role, for he appears to be both savior and the soul that he saves; he saves and must himself be saved. So too the pearl, which at first ap- pears to be a symbol of the soul, is also the deity who saves the soul. The no- tion of the double is typically gnostic: the role of Thomas as twin in the Gospel of Thomas and the Book of Thomas is but one example. As Jonas points out, \"the interchangeability of the subject and object of the mission, of savior and soul, Prince and Pearl, is the key to the true meaning of the poem, and to the gnostic eschitology in general.\" 2 Other symbols in the poem are doubled as well. The prince's garment of glory, which is his spiritual body, he has taken off and left behind in order to assume the unclean robe of the world, which is obviously the unclean physical body. But the garment of glory also operates as an independent being, re- minding him of his duty to return. So too the letter, on which is written the call of redemption, flies down like an eagle from heaven and becomes a mes- senger of light, in a way that recalls the heavenly letter of the Songs of Solomon. On the way the letter, the word, seems to take on a woman's voice. Whoever the author and whatever the background, that poem's creator revels in games of spiritual ambiguity, skirting confusion as it deepens into swift spectacle. The prince has left the east, the land of light and origin, to go down to Egypt, which stands traditionally for the body, for material things, for dark- ness and error. It is the kingdom of death, which is exemplified by the tomb culture and underground cult of the dead. Likewise, the serpent is the realm of darkness and ignorance, in dark waters on the earth below the sea. In this fable of redemption, as Hans Jonas points out, the savior himself must be saved—or rather, must save himself. We see the dramatic way in 2.

Ultimately his parents, the father of truth and mother of wis- dom, do not abandon him. They send messages. He wakes from the prison of earthly things, steals the pearl, and returns to his royal parents with the prom- ise of rising to his true parents of the spirit. Whether this popular tale is an old Mesopotamian legend or a Jewish or Christian story that has undergone a gnostic overlay, in the form in which it survives it is a poetic culmination of gnostic principles, conveyed with a min- imum of cosmogony and deific mischief. It has the stanzaic form of Jewish poetry, without rhyme or fixed meter, where prosody is based largely on par- allelistic couplets. The Song of the Pearl appears as a supplement to the apoc- ryphal Greek Acts of Thomas. One version is in Greek and another slightly different version in Syriac. Its date of composition, Bentley Layton suggests, points to the Parthian dynasty of Persia (247 BCE-224 CE); or, if composed in Edessa when the city was under Parthian control, before 165 CE.

Like the Gospel of Thomas, the Book of Thomas is identified at the opening of the document as a sayings collection: \"The hidden sayings that the savior spoke to Judas Thomas.\" The editor of the collection is identified as a certain Mathaias, whose name is similar to that of the messenger (or apostle) and gospel-writer Matthew (Matthaios) and the replacement apostle Matthias (Acts 1:26), but whose precise identity remains uncertain. Appended at the end of the document are the words \"the Book of Thomas the Contender Writing to the Perfect.\" Traditionally this inscription has been taken at face value, but some scholars have suggested that it may be read as two titles of the text, \"The Book of Thomas,\" and \"The Contender Writing to the Perfect,\" and that these two titles may reflect the composite na- ture of the text. After all, the text contains sayings of Jesus and a dialogue be- tween Jesus and Thomas, along with a sermon by Jesus on sinners who face judgment. Hans-Martin Schenke argues that the contender designated in the second title is none other than the patriarch Jacob, the most famous con- tender in the Jewish tradition. Hence, Schenke maintains, behind the present Book of Thomas may be a Jewish source in the form of a letter said to be au- thored by Jacob the contender. Within the Book of Thomas the utterances of Jesus sometimes recall say- ings and themes in the Gospel of Thomas.

In the middle of the text, and at the very end, Jesus states that one should seek (or pray) and find and rest, as in Gospel of Thomas 2. Like the Book of Thomas in general, the ser- mon of Jesus recommends an ascetic way of life, and as such it is profoundly concerned about the life and the sins of the flesh. In its presentation the ser- mon echoes ancient descriptions of the underworld and punishments for the wicked and anticipates later portrayals of judgment in Dante's Inferno and even Jonathan Edwards's sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.\" The Book of Thomas survives in Coptic in the Nag Hammadi library. Like the Gospel of Thomas, the Book of Thomas probably was composed in Greek, in Syria, where Thomas was revered. John Turner proposes that at least part of the Book of Thomas should be dated to the first part of the third century, that is, after the Gospel of Thomas and before the Acts of Thomas.

So then, my brother Thomas, you have seen what is hidden from people, what they stumble against in their ignorance.\" THE HIDDEN AND THE VISIBLE Thomas said to the master, \"For this reason I beg you to tell me what I ask be- fore your ascension. When I hear from you about the hidden, I can speak of it. And clearly it is hard to bring truth to people.\" The savior answered and said, \"If what is visible to you is obscure to you, how can you comprehend what is invisible? If deeds of truth visible in the world are hard for you to carry out, how will you do invisible things of exalted greatness and fullness? 5 How can you be called workers? You are beginners and have not attained the greatness of perfection.\" Thomas answered and said to the savior, \"Tell us about these things that you say are not visible but are hidden from us.\" The savior said, \"All bodies have come into being in the same irrational way that animals are produced, and so they are visible, as creatures lusting after creatures. Those that are above, however, do not exist like those that are visible. Rather, they live 6 from their own root, and it is their crops that nour- ish them. These visible bodies feed on creatures that are like them, and so the bodies are subject to change. Now, whatever is subject to change will perish and be lost, and henceforth has no hope of life, because this body is an animal body. Just as animal bodies perish, so also will these figures perish. Is it 7 not from copulation like that of the animals? If it too is from copulation, how will it give birth to anything different from them? So then you are children until you become perfect.\" Thomas answered, \"So I say to you, master, those who speak about what is invisible and difficult to explain are like people who shoot their arrows at a target during the night. Of course, they shoot their arrows as any people do, 4. This recalls the Delphic maxim \"Know yourself\" and Gospel of Thomas 3. 5.

And when all the chosen ones lay down their animal nature, then this light will withdraw up to its being, and its being will welcome it to itself, because the light is a good helper.\" WISDOM AND FOOLISHNESS Then the savior continued and said, \"Oh, unsearchable love of light! Oh, bit- terness of the fire! You blaze in the bodies of people, and in the marrow of their bones, blazing in them night and day, burning their limbs and making their minds drunk and their souls deranged. You dominate males and fe- males day and night, you move and arouse them secretly and visibly. When the males are aroused, they are attracted to the females and the females to the males. So it is said that everyone who seeks truth from true wisdom 9 will fashion wings to fly, fleeing from the passion that burns human spirits. And one will fashion wings to flee from every visible spirit.\" Thomas answered, saying, \"Master, this is precisely what I ask you. I un- derstand that what you say is beneficial to us.\" Again the savior answered and said, \"This is why we must speak to you, be- cause this teaching is for those who are perfect. If you wish to become perfect, keep these sayings. If not, the name for you is 'ignorant,' since an intelligent person cannot associate with a fool. The intelligent person is perfect in all wis- dom.

For the vessel of their flesh will pass away, and when it disintegrates, it will remain in visible things, among things that can be seen. The visible fire hurts them, because of the love of faith they once had. They will be gathered back to the visible realm. 13 Moreover, among the invisible, those who can see will perish, without the first love, in their concern for this life and the burning of the fire. There is only a little time before what is visible will pass away. Then shapeless phantoms will come and stay forever in tombs on corpses, in pain and destruction of soul.\" 14 Thomas answered and said, \"What can we say in the face of these things? 15 What shall we say to the blind?

As in other tractates, such as Herakleon's Commen- tary on the Gospel of John, the notion of allegorical interpretation of scrip- ture is central, a practice that orthodox Christians essentially adopted from the gnostics while repudiating their thought. Here the interpretation extends to the Hebrew prophets and Homer. Not only are these interpreted in ways that support a gnostic system, but the texts themselves, at least in our Coptic version, also appear in versions differing markedly from standard texts in ways that confirm a gnostic slant. The author's sources were probably the an- thologies of the day. The soul in Greek is Psyche. She is understood to be feminine in name and nature, and great stories are told about her in Greco-Roman literature. Here in the Exegesis on the Soul she is presented as originally androgynous when she was a virgin and with her father. When she fell into the earthly world she lost her virginity to lovers and bandits, who deceived her as she deceived herself. In her first fallen state, though the details are not transparent, the womb, which appears to be the womb of the soul, is external, like male genitalia. Cap- tive to her body and to men who abuse her through physical pleasure and then abandon her, she asks the father to have mercy on her. The father turns the"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"406 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM womb of her soul inward. Thereby she is stronger to protect herself against wan- ton carnal lovers. And he sends a bridegroom from heaven, her brother, to have chaste sex with her and produce good, rather than demented, children. Her chaste lovemaking in the bridal chamber is a form of purification and rebirth, which is equivalent to deliverance, resurrection, and ascension to heaven. The story is fantastic and told like an ancient novella. It has been com- pared to Jewish writings from the Bible and the apocrypha, since the soul, the heroine, is presented as a woman. So it follows the scheme of redemption of such sinners as Ruth, Tamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba. Centering on women's redemption was also typical of other Jewish literature of the time, including documents recounting the experience of the soul in the Essene texts found at Qumran. The diverse influences in the exegesis—Jewish, Christian, Greco- Roman, gnostic—reveal a syncretistic context for composition. From this so- phisticated melange came this flagrantly sexual and heavenly erotic gnostic scripture. THE EXEGESIS ON THE SOUL 1 VIRGINITY AND DEFILEMENT Sages gave the soul a feminine name. In nature she is also feminine. She even has a womb. While she was alone with her father, she was a virgin and in an androgy- nous form. When she fell down into a body and entered this life, then she fell into the hands of thieves. Wanton men passed her from one to the other, used her, some by force, others by seducing her with a gift. They defiled her and took her virginity from her. In her body she became a whore and gave herself to everyone, seeing each one she hugged as a husband. After she let herself be taken by lecherous, un- faithful adulterers, she sighed deeply and repented. But even when she turned her face from the adulterers, she ran to others, and they compelled her to live with them and make love with them on their beds as if they were her masters.

After all these acts, they took off, abandoning her. She became a poor desolate widow, helpless. In her affliction she had no food. From them she had gathered nothing but the defilements when they coupled with her. Her offspring from the adulterers are mute, blind, and sickly. They are disturbed. But when her father who is above looked down on her and saw her sighing, suffering and in disgrace, and repenting of her pros- titution, then she began to call on him for help with all her heart, saying, \"Save me, my father. Look, I will report to you, for I left my house and fled from my woman's quarters. Restore me to yourself.\" When he saw her in this state, he thought her worthy of his mercy. She had many afflictions for having abandoned her house. THE PROSTITUTION OF THE SOUL Concerning the prostitution of the soul, the holy spirit prophesies in diverse places. The prophet Jeremiah said, 2 If a man divorces his wife, and she leaves him and takes another man, can she ever go back to him? Has such a woman not utterly defiled herself? \"You have whored with many shepherds and you returned to me,\" said the lord. \"Lift up your eyes and see where you went whoring. Were you not sitting in the streets defiling the land with your whoring and vices? And you took many shep- herds for a way of stumbling. You were shameless with everyone. You did not call on me as a companion or father or author of your virginity.\" It is also written in the prophet Hosea, 3 Come, go before the law with your mother, for she is not to be my wife nor I her husband. I shall remove her whoring from my presence and her adultery from between her breasts. I shall make her naked as on the day she was born, and desolate like a 2. Jeremiah 3:1-4.

They gave me my bread and water and garments and clothes and wine and oil and everything I needed.\" Look, I shall shut them up so that she will not be able to chase after her adulterers. When she seeks them and doesn't find them, she will say, \"I will go back to my former husband, for then I was happier than now.\" Again in Ezekiel he said, 4 It happened that after much depravity, the lord said, \"You built yourself a brothel and made yourself a beautiful place in the streets. You built whorehouses in every alley and you wasted your beauty, you spread your legs in every alley, and multiplied your acts of prostitution. You were a whore for the sons of Egypt, those who are your neighbors, men great of flesh.\" But what does \"the sons of Egypt, men great of flesh\" signify, if not the domain of the flesh and the perceptible realm and the affairs of the earth by which the soul is defiled here, receiving bread from them as well as wine, oil, clothing, and the other external nonsense surrounding the body—whose things she thinks she needs? But as to this whoring, the messengers of the savior commanded, 5 \"Guard and purify yourself against it,\" and not just the body's prostitution but espe- cially the soul's. That is why the messengers write to the churches of god that such whoring might not go on here. Yet the greatest struggle is the prostitution of the soul. From it comes the prostitution of the body. So Paul, writing to the Corinthians, said, 6 I wrote in my letter, \"Do not associate with whores,\" meaning not the whores of the world or the greedy or thieves or idol wor- shipers, since then you would have to leave the world.

BAPTISM OF THE SOUL As long as the soul goes on running around everywhere sleeping with whomever she meets and defiling herself, she will suffer her deserved punish- ment. But when she perceives the troubles she is in, weeps before the father, and repents, then the father will pity her and make her womb turn from the external and turn inward again, and she will recover her proper character. It is not like this for a woman. The body's womb is inside the body like the other internal organs, but the soul's womb is turned to the outside like the male gen- italia, which are external. Therefore, when the womb of the soul, by the father's will, turns itself in- ward, she is baptized and immediately cleansed of external pollution forced upon her, just as dirty clothing is soaked in water and stirred until the dirt is removed and it is clean. So the cleansing of the soul is to recover the freshness of her former nature and to become as she was. That is her baptism. Then she will begin to rage at herself like a woman in labor, writhing and screaming in the hour of delivery. But since she is female, she is powerless by herself to inseminate a child. So the father sent her from heaven her man, her brother, the firstborn. The bridegroom came down to the bride. She gave up her former whoring and cleansed herself of the pollution of adulterers, and she was renewed to be a bride. She cleansed herself in the bridal chamber. She filled it with perfume and sat there waiting for the true groom. She no longer goes about the marketplace, copulating with whomever she desires, but she waits for him, saying, \"When will he come?\" And she feared him, not knowing what he looked like. She no longer remembers, since she fell from her father's house long ago. She dreamed of him, by the father's will, like a woman in love with a man. THE MARRIAGE Then, by the will of the father, the bridegroom came down to her in the bridal chamber, which had been prepared. And he decorated the chamber.

In this marriage once they join they become a single life. As the prophet said about the first man and woman, 8 They will become a single flesh. They were originally joined to each other when they were with the father, before the woman led the man astray, who is her brother. This marriage brings them together again, and the soul joins her true love and real master, as the scriptures tell us 9 : The woman's master is her husband. Then gradually she recognized him and was again happy, weeping before him as she remembered the disgrace of her former widowhood. She adorned herself abundantly so he might be pleased to stay with her. And the prophet said in the Psalms, 10 Hear, my daughter, and see me and bend your ear, and forget your people and your father's house, for the king has desired your beauty, and he is your lord. He has her turn her face from her people and the gang of her adulterers with whom she had mingled, to devote herself now to her king, her real lord, and to forget the house of the earthly father with whom things were bad for her, and remember her father in heaven. So Abraham was told, 11 Leave your country and kin and your father's house. REGENERATION OF THE SOUL When the soul had adorned herself again in her beauty, she enjoyed her beloved. He also loved her. And when they made love, she got from him the seed which is the life-giving spirit. By him she has good children and brings them up. Such is the great and perfect marvel of birth. This marriage is made perfect by the will of the father. Now, it is right that the soul be regenerated and be as she formerly was. The soul stirred. Her divine nature and her rejuvenation came from her father so she might return to where she was before. This is resurrection from the dead. 8. Genesis 2:24. 9.

Your youth will be renewed like the eagle's. When she becomes young again she will rise, praising the father and her brother who rescued her. Through rebirth the soul will be saved. And salva- tion will not be because of rote phrases or professional skills or learned books. Rather, it will come from the grace and gift of the merciful god. Such is the heavenly way. So the savior cries out, 13 No one can come unless my father draws him and brings him to me. I myself will raise him on the last day. PRAYING FROM THE SOUL So it is right to pray to the father and to call on him with our soul—not exter- nally with our lips but with the spirit, which is inside and comes from the depths, sighing, repenting for the life we led, confessing sins, recognizing the deception we were in as shallow; perceiving the empty zeal; weeping over how we lived in darkness and in the wave; mourning for what we were so that he might pity us; hating ourselves for what we still are. The savior said, 14 Blessings on those who mourn, for they will be pitied. Blessings on the hungry, for they will be filled. And he said, 15 If one does not hate one's own soul, one cannot follow me. The beginning of salvation is repentance. So it says, 16 Before Jesus came John, preaching the baptism of repentance. 12. Psalm 103:1-5. 13- John 6:44. 14- Matthew 5:4, 6; Luke 6:21. 15- Luke 14:26. 16. Acts 13:24."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"412 LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM And repentance occurs in distress and sorrow. The father is good and loves humankind, and hears the soul that calls him and sends her the light of salva- tion. Through the spirit to the prophet he says, 17 Say to the children of my people, \"If your sins extend from earth to heaven, if they become red like scarlet and blacker than sack- cloth, and if you return to me with all your soul and say to me, 'My father,' I will care for you as for a holy people.\" Again elsewhere, 18 So the lord, the holy one of Israel, says, \"If you return and sigh, then you will be saved and will know where you were when you trusted what is shallow.\" And again, 19 Jerusalem wept profusely, saying, \"Pity me.\" He will have pity at the sound of your lamentation. And when he saw, he cared for you. And the lord will give you the bread of affliction and water of oppression. From now on those who deceive will not go near you. Your eye will spot those who would deceive you. THE REPENTANCE OF ODYSSEUS AND HELEN So it is right to pray to god night and day, extending our hands toward him as do people sailing in the middle of the sea. They pray to god with all their heart and without hypocrisy. Those who pray hypocritically fool only themselves. Yes, it is to know who is worthy of salvation that god examines our inner selves and the bottom of our heart. No one is worthy of salvation who still loves the place of deception. So the poet writes, 20 Odysseus sat on the island weeping and grieving and turning his face from the words of Calypso and from her tricks, while long- ing to see his village and smoke coming forth from it. Had he not 17. See 1 Clement 8:3. 18. Isaiah 30:15. 19. Isaiah 30:19-20. 20. Homer, Odyssey 1.48-59.

Again Helen says, 21 My heart turned away from myself. I want to return to my own house. She sighed, saying, 22 Aphrodite deceived me and brought me out of my village. My only daughter I left behind me as well as my good, understand- ing, and handsome husband. When the soul leaves her perfect husband because of the treachery of Aphrodite, who exists here in the act of conception, then the soul will suffer harm. But if she sighs and repents, she will be restored to her house. THE REPENTANCE OF ISRAEL Israel surely would not have been visited by god and brought out of the land of Egypt and the house of bondage if it had not sighed to god and wept about its oppressive labors.

On the Origin of the World appears in the Nag Hammadi library, Codex II, immediately after the Sethian text Reality of the Rulers, the text it most closely resembles. The parallels between the two texts are extensive. On the Origin of the World reflects many of the Sethian gnostic themes found in other Sethian texts as well, but the present text is not easily classified as Sethian. Sometimes it seems Sethian, sometimes Valentinian, sometimes Manichaean. It always is, in some sense, gnostic. On the Origin of the World opens with a philosophical issue that sounds disarmingly modern in its formulation: What, if anything, existed prior to the original chaos, the primal ooze, the beginning as described in Genesis 1 and other ancient Middle Eastern creation myths? On the Origin of the World seeks to demonstrate that before chaos was the root of chaos, the infinite. The plot that unfolds in the text features the creative and salvific roles of Sophia and her mother, Pistis (faith). The daughter is also called Sophia Zoe (life) or simply Zoe, the mother Pistis Sophia. From Pistis Sophia, in a manner O"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM 415 recalling childbirth, emerges the demiurge Yaldabaoth, who is expelled, the text emphasizes, like an aborted fetus (as in an interpretation of the Secret Book of John). He establishes his kingdom of chaos, complete with the pow- ers of the world, and brags that he is god alone. Of course he is wrong, and one of his sons, Sabaoth by name, is exalted above him with Sophia in the seventh heaven, where he proceeds to create an assembly of angels, a firstborn named Israel, and Jesus the anointed. Father Yaldabaoth, in turn, counters by creating death. Thus unfolds the gloomy process of mortal dissolution in the cosmos, of life leading inexorably to death. This story, familiar from other gnostic accounts of the creation of the world and people in the world, is told with reference to the opening chapters of Genesis from the Hebrew Bible. In a manner that recalls the Secret Book of John and the three divisions of humankind in Valentinian texts, Adam is un- derstood in three ways, as spiritual Adam, psychical Adam, and earthly Adam. Also inserted into the account are asides on Eros, the Greek god of love, along with Psyche (soul), lover of Eros, and Egyptian phoenixes, water animals, and bulls, and all of these are part of the gnostic cosmology. Innocent spirits come to awaken people to gnosis, as does Jesus, so that finally the powers of the present age will collapse, and light and life will triumph. As the text concludes, \"it is necessary that everyone enter the place from which he has come. For each one by his deeds and his gnosis will reveal his nature.\" On the Origin of the World is untitled in the manuscripts that have survived, but the present descriptive title is often used. The text was almost certainly written in Greek before being translated into Coptic. Hans-Gebhard Bethge suggests, \"The work was probably composed in Alexandria at the end of the third century A.D. or beginning of the fourth.\" 1 The text is in a learned, even scholarly style and contains etymological and bibliographical references. Most of the works cited in the text are unknown to us. Exceptions to this may include books of Noraia (or Oraia), which may refer to the Thought of Norea in the Nag Hammadi library, Codex IX,2, and the Archangelic Book of the Prophet Moses, which may refer to a text from the Greek magical papyri. 1.

ON THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD 2 BEFORE THE BEGINNING Since everyone—the gods of the world and people—says that nothing existed prior to chaos, I shall demonstrate that they all are mistaken, since they do not know the origin of chaos and its root. Here is the demonstration. How agreeable it is to all people to say that chaos is darkness! But actually chaos comes from a shadow that has been called darkness. The shadow comes from something existing from the beginning. So it is obvious that something in the beginning existed before chaos came into being, and that chaos came after what was in the beginning. 3 Now let us consider the facts of the matter, and in particular what was in the beginning, from which chaos came. In this way the truth will be clearly demonstrated. BIRTH OF SOPHIA AND THE FORCES OF DARKNESS After the nature of the immortals was completed out of the infinite one, 4 then a likeness called Sophia 5 flowed out of Pistis, 6 with the wish 7 that something should come into being like the light that first existed. Immediately her wish appeared as a heavenly likeness with an incomprehensible greatness. This 2. On the Origin of the World is preserved in Nag Hammadi library, Codex 11,5 PP- 97>24 to 127,17.

It was a veil separating people from the things above. 8 Now, the eternal realm of truth has no shadow within it because the im- measurable light is everywhere within it. Outside it, however, is a shadow, and it was called darkness. 9 From it appeared a power over the darkness. And the powers that came into being afterward called the shadow the limitless chaos. From it every kind of deity was brought forth, one after another, along with the whole place. Consequently, the shadow too is subsequent to what was in the beginning. The shadow appeared in the abyss, which is derived from Pis- tis, whom we have mentioned. The shadow perceived that there was one stronger than it. 10 It was jealous, and when it became self-impregnated, it immediately bore envy. Since that day the principle of envy has appeared in all of the aeons and their worlds. But envy was found to be an aborted fetus without any spirit in it. It became like the shadows in a great watery substance. Then the bitter wrath that came into being from the shadow was cast into a region of chaos. Since that day a watery substance has appeared. What was enclosed in the shadow flowed forth, appearing in chaos. Just as all the useless afterbirth of one who bears a little child falls, likewise the matter that came into being from the shadow was cast aside. Matter did not come out of chaos, but it was in chaos, existing in a part of it. YALDABAOTH ESTABLISHES HIS RULE Now, after these things happened, Pistis came and appeared over the matter of chaos, which was cast off like an aborted fetus, since there was no spirit in it. For all of that is a boundless darkness and water of unfathomable depth. And when Pistis saw what came into being from her deficiency, she was disturbed. And the disturbance appeared as something frightful, and it fled to her in the chaos. She turned to it and breathed into its face in the abyss, which is beneath all of the heavens. 8. A similar veil is mentioned in the Gospel of Philip, and limit (hows) functions as a < boundary in Valentinian thought in general. The concept of the region of the middle, the immortal and mortal realms, is also common in gnostic texts. 9.\"The infinite is all light, and outside is shadow, darkness. 10.

And the gods and angels and people constitute that which came into being by means of the word. Moreover, the ruler Yaldabaoth is ignorant of the power of Pistis. He did not see her face, but he saw in the water the likeness that spoke with him. And from that voice he called himself Yaldabaoth. But the perfect ones call him Ariael because he was like a lion. 14 And after he came to possess authority over matter, Pistis Sophia withdrew up to her light. YALDABAOTH CREATES HEAVEN AND EARTH AND BEARS THREE SONS When the ruler saw his greatness, he saw only himself; he saw nothing else, ex- cept water and darkness. Then he thought that he alone existed. His thought was made complete by means of the word, and it appeared as a spirit moving to and fro over the waters. 15 And when that spirit appeared, the ruler sepa- rated the watery substance to one region and the dry substance to another re- gion. From matter he created a dwelling place for himself and called it heaven. And from matter the ruler created a footstool and called it earth. Afterward the ruler thought, according to his nature, and he created an an- drogynous being by means of the word. He opened his mouth and cooed to him.

THE SEVEN HEAVENS OF CHAOS Seven appeared in chaos as androgynous beings. They have their masculine name and their feminine name. The feminine name of Yaldabaoth is fore- thought 18 Sambathas, 19 which is the week. 20 His son is called Yao, and his fem- inine name is lordship. Sabaoth's 21 feminine name is divinity. Adonaios's feminine name is kingship. Eloaios's feminine name is envy. Oraios's feminine name is wealth. Astaphaios's feminine name is Sophia. These are the seven powers of the seven heavens of chaos. And they came into being as androgy- nous beings according to the immortal pattern that existed before them and in accord with the will of Pistis, so that the likeness of what existed from the first might rule until the end. You will find the function of these names and the power of the males in the Archangelic Book of Moses the Prophet. 22 But the feminine names are in the First Book of Noraia. 23 Now since the chief creator 24 Yaldabaoth had great authority, he created for each of his sons, by means of the word, beautiful heavens as dwelling places, and for each heaven great glories, seven times exquisite. Each one has within his heaven thrones, dwelling places, and temples, as well as chariots and spiritual virgins and their glories, looking up to an invisible realm, and also armies of divine, lordly, angelic, and archangelic powers, myriads without number, in order to serve. The report concerning these you will find accurately in the First Account of Noraia. Now, they were completed in this way up to the sixth heaven, the one be- longing to Sophia.

And all the gods and their angels gave him praise and glory. And he rejoiced in his heart, and he boasted continually, saying to them, \"I do not need anything. I am god and there is no other god but me.\" 28 But when he said these things, he sinned against all of the immortal imperishable ones, and they kept their eyes on him. Moreover, when Pistis saw the impiety of the chief ruler, she was angry. Without being seen, she said, \"You're wrong, Samael,\" that is, \"blind god.\" 29 \"An enlightened, immortal human exists before you and will appear within your fashioned bodies. 30 The human will trample upon you as potter's clay is trampled.

He glorified her because she informed them of an immortal human and the light of the human. Then Pistis Sophia stretched forth her finger and poured upon him light from her light for a condemnation of his father. When Sabaoth received light, he received great authority against all of the powers of chaos. Since that day he has been called \"the lord of the powers.\" 32 He hated his father, the darkness, and his mother, the abyss. He loathed his sister, the thought of the chief creator, the one who moves to and fro over the water. On account of his light, all of the authorities of chaos were jealous of him. And when they were disturbed, they made a great war in the seven heavens. Then when Pistis Sophia saw the war, she sent seven archangels from her light to Sabaoth. They snatched him away up to the seventh heaven. 33 They took their stand before him as servants. Furthermore, she sent him three other archangels and established the kingdom for him above everyone so that he might dwell above the twelve gods of chaos. When Sabaoth received the place of rest because of his repentance, Pistis also gave him her daughter, Zoe, 34 with great authority, so that she might in- form him about everything that exists in the eighth heaven. And since he had authority, he first created a dwelling place for himself. It is huge, magnificent, seven times as great as all those that exist in the seven heavens. Then in front of his dwelling place he created a great throne on a chariot with four faces, called cherubim. 35 And the cherubim throne has eight shapes on each side of the four corners—forms of lions and bulls and humans and eagles—so that all of the forms total sixty-four forms. And seven archangels stand before him. He is the eighth, having authority. All of the forms total sev- enty-two.

But at his left the virgin of the holy spirit sits upon a throne praising him. And the seven virgins stand before her, with thirty lyres and harps and trumpets in their hands, glorifying him. 39 And all of the armies of angels glorify him and praise him.

And this tree is in the north of paradise to raise up the souls from the stupor of the demons, so they might come to the tree of life and eat its fruit and condemn the authorities and their angels.

The olive tree ap- peared in the light of the first Adam for the sake of the anointing that they will receive. THE CREATION OF PLANTS, ANIMALS, AND HEAVENLY ORBS But the first Psyche 55 loved Eros, who was with her, and poured her blood upon him and upon the earth. Then from that blood the first rose sprouted upon the earth out of the thorn bush, for a joy in the light that was to appear in the bramble. After this the beautiful, fragrant flowers sprouted up from the earth according to their kind from the blood of each of the virgins of the daughters of forethought. When they had become enamored of Eros, they poured out their blood upon him and upon the earth. After these things every herb sprouted up in the earth according to its kind, having the seed of the au- thorities and their angels. After these things the authorities created from the waters all species of beasts and reptiles and birds according to their kind, having the seed of the authorities and their angels. But before all these things, when Adam of light appeared on the first day, he remained upon the earth about two days. He left the lower forethought in heaven and began to ascend to his light. And immediately darkness came upon the whole world. Now, when Sophia, who is in the lower heaven, 56 wanted to receive authority from Pistis, she created great luminaries and all the stars, and put them in the heaven to shine upon the earth and to perfect chronological signs and seasons and years and months and days and nights and seconds, and so on. And thus everything up in the sky was ordered. Now, when Adam of light wanted to enter his light, that is, the eighth heaven, he was unable because of the poverty that had mixed with his light. Then he created a great eternal realm for himself; in that eternal realm he created six realms and their worlds, six in number, which are seven times bet- ter than the heavens of chaos and their worlds. But all these realms and their worlds exist within the infinite region that is between the eighth and chaos beneath it, and they are reckoned with the world that belongs to the poverty. 55. Soul.

They laughed at the chief creator because he lied, saying, \"I am god and there is no other god but me.\" When they came to him, they said, \"Is this not the god who ruined our work?\" He answered and said, \"Yes, but if you wish that he not be able to ruin our work, come, let's create a human being from the earth ac- cording to the image of our body and according to the likeness of this being, 58 to serve us, so that whenever this being sees his likeness, he may become en- amored of it. Then he will no longer ruin our work, but we shall make those who are born from the light our servants through all the time of this age.\" Now, all this came to pass according to the forethought of Pistis in order that humankind might appear after this likeness and condemn them on ac- count of their fashioned bodies. And their fashioned bodies became fences for the light. 59 Then the authorities received knowledge necessary to create people. Sophia Zoe, who is with Sabaoth, anticipated them and laughed at their deci- sion because they were blind—in ignorance they created him against them- selves. They do not know what they do. Because of this she anticipated them. She created her human being first in order that he might tell their fashioned body how to scorn them and thus to escape them. Now, the birth of the instructor occurred in this way. 60 When Sophia let a drop of light fall, it floated on the water. Immediately a human being ap- peared, being androgynous. She molded that drop first as a female body. Af- terward she molded it, with the body, in the likeness of the mother who appeared, and she finished it in twelve months. An androgynous human being was conceived, whom the Greeks call Hermaphrodite, 61 while the Jews call his mother Eve of life, that is, the instructor of life. Her child is the creature who is lord. Afterward, the authorities called it the beast in order to lead their fash- ioned bodies astray. The meaning of the beast is the instructor, for it was 57. Another unknown source. 58.

Moreover, Eve is the first virgin who gave birth without a man. She is the one who functioned as her own midwife.

I am the one who comforts during labor pains. My husband produced me, and I am his mother, and he is my father and my lord. He is my potency; what he desires he speaks with reason. I am becoming, but I have borne a lordly man. 62 Now these things were revealed by the will of Sabaoth and his Christ to the souls who will come to the fashioned bodies of the authorities. 63 Concerning these the holy voice said, \"Multiply and flourish to rule over all the crea- tures.\" 64 And these are the ones who are taken captive by the chief creator ac- cording to their destinies, and thus they were locked in the prisons of the fashioned bodies until the consummation of the age. THE COSMIC RULERS MOLD ADAM At that time the chief creator then expressed his opinion about humankind to those who were with him. Then each of them cast his seed 65 into the midst of the navel of the earth. Since that day, the seven rulers have formed humankind with his body like their body, but his likeness is like the human who appeared to them. His fashioned body came into being one part at a time, and their chief created the brain and nervous system.

Regarding this, when the chief ruler remembered the word of Pistis, he was afraid that the true human might come into his fashioned body and rule over it. Because of this, he left this fashioned body forty days without soul. And he withdrew and left him. But on the fortieth day Sophia Zoe sent her breath into Adam, who was without soul. He began to move upon the earth, but he could not stand up. 69 Now, when the seven rulers came and saw him, they were very much dis- turbed. They walked up to him and seized him, and the chief ruler said to the breath within him, \"Who are you? And from where have you come here?\" It answered and said, \"I came through the power of the human for the destruc- tion of your work.\" When they heard, they glorified him because he gave them rest from their fear and concern. Then they called that day the day of rest, 70 because they rested themselves from their troubles. And when they saw that Adam could not stand up, they rejoiced. They took him and left him in para- dise and withdrew up to their heavens. EVE GIVES ADAM LIFE After the day of rest, Sophia sent Zoe, her daughter, who is called Eve, as an instructor to raise up Adam, in whom there was no soul, so that those whom he would produce might become vessels of the light. When Eve saw her male partner cast down, she pitied him, and she said, \"Adam, live! Rise up on the earth!\" Immediately her word became an accomplished deed. For when Adam rose up, immediately he opened his eyes. When he saw her, he said, \"You will be called the mother of the living, because you are the one who gave me life.\" 71 THE COSMIC RULERS RAPE THE EARTHLY EVE Then the authorities were informed that their fashioned body was alive, and had risen, and they were very much disturbed.

But let us not tell Adam, because he is not from us. Rather, let us bring a stupor upon him, and suggest to him in his sleep that she came into being from his rib, so that the woman may serve and he may rule over her.\" 72 Then Eve, since she existed as a power, laughed at their false intention. She darkened their eyes and secretly left her likeness there with Adam. She entered the tree of knowledge and remained there. They pursued her, and she revealed to them that she had entered the tree and had become the tree. And when the blind ones fell into a great fear, they ran away. 73 Afterward, when they sobered up from the stupor, they came to Adam. And when they saw the likeness of that woman with him, they were troubled, thinking that this was the true Eve. And they acted recklessly, and came to her and seized her and cast their seed upon her. They did it deceitfully, defiling her not only naturally but also abominably, first defiling the seal of her voice, which had spoken with them, saying, \"What is it that exists before you?\" They meant to defile those who might say at the consummation of the age that they had been born of a true human by means of the word.

Now, the prog- eny of the earthly Adam multiplied and was completed and produced within itself all the technical skill of the Adam with soul. But all were in ignorance. THE TREES OF PARADISE AND THE BEAST Next, let me continue. When the rulers saw him and the woman who was with him erring in ignorance like beasts, they rejoiced greatly. When they learned that an immortal human was not going to pass them by, but that they would even have to fear the woman who had turned into a tree, they were troubled and said, \"Is this, perhaps, the true human, who blinded us and taught us about this defiled woman who is like him, that we might be conquered?\" Then the seven took counsel. They came to Adam and Eve timidly, and they said to him, \"The fruit of every tree created for you in paradise may be eaten, but beware, don't eat from the tree of knowledge. If you do eat, you will die.\" 75 After they gave them a great fright, they withdrew up to their authorities. Then came the one who is wiser than all creatures, who was called the beast. When he saw the likeness of their mother, Eve, he said to her, \"What is it that god said to you? 'Don't eat from the tree of knowledge'?\" She said, \"He said not only'Don't eat from it' but also 'Don't touch it, lest you die.'\" He said to her, \"Don't be afraid! You certainly shall not die. For he knows that when you eat from it your mind will be sobered and you will become like gods, knowing the difference between evil and good people. For he said this to you because he is jealous, so that you would not eat from it.\" 76 Now, Eve believed the words of the instructor. She looked at the tree and saw that it was beautiful and appealing, and she desired it. She took some of its fruit and ate, and she gave to her husband also, and he ate too. Then their minds opened. For when they ate, the light of knowledge shone for them. When they put on shame, they knew that they were naked with regard to knowledge. When they sobered up, they saw that they were naked, and they became enamored of one another. When they saw that their makers had beastly forms, they loathed them. They understood a great deal. 74.

Then when the rulers knew that Adam and Eve had transgressed their com- mandment, they entered paradise and came to Adam and Eve in an earth- quake and a great threat, to see the result of the help that was given. 77 Then Adam and Eve were very much disturbed and hid under the trees in para- dise. The rulers did not know where they were and said, \"Adam, where are you?\" He said, \"I am here. But because of fear of you I hid after I became ashamed.\" But they said to him, in ignorance, \"Who is the one who spoke to you of the shame that you put on—unless you ate from the tree?\" He said, \"The woman whom you gave me, she is the one who gave to me, and I ate.\" Then they said to that woman, \"What is this you have done?\" She answered and said, \"The instructor is the one who incited me, and I ate.\" Then the rulers came to the instructor. Their eyes were blinded by him so they were not able to do anything to him. They merely cursed him, since they were powerless. Afterward they came to the woman, and they cursed her and her offspring. After the woman they cursed Adam and the earth and the fruit be- cause of him. And everything that they created they cursed. There is no blessing from them. Good cannot come from evil. Since that day the authorities knew that truly there was something stronger than they. They would not have known except that their command- ment was broken. They brought a great envy into the world only because of the immortal human. 78 Now, when the rulers saw that their Adam had acquired a different knowledge, they wanted to test him. They gathered all the domestic animals and wild beasts of the earth and the birds of the heaven, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. When he saw them, he gave names to their creatures. They were troubled because Adam had sobered up from all ignorance. 79 They gathered together and took counsel and said, \"Look, Adam has become like one of us, so that he understands the difference between light and darkness. Now perhaps he will be deceived as with the tree of knowledge and will come to the tree of life and eat from it and become im- mortal and rule and condemn us and regard us and all our glory as folly. And then he will pass judgment on us and the world. Come, let's cast him out of 77. This is the help offered by the instructor, the serpent, which resulted in knowledge. 78. See Genesis 3:6-19. 79.

And what they had done did not satisfy them. Rather, they were still afraid. They came to the tree of life and they set great terrors around it, fiery living beings called cherubim; and they left a flaming sword in the midst, turning continually with a great terror, so that no one from among earthly beings might ever enter that place. 80 After these things, when the rulers had become jealous of Adam, they wanted to diminish the human lifetimes, but they were unable because of fate, which was established since the beginning. For their lifetimes were de- termined: for each of the people one thousand years according to the circuit of the luminaries. But although the rulers were not able to do this, each of the evildoers took away ten years. So all of the remaining time amounts to nine hundred thirty years, and these are spent in grief and weakness and in evil distractions. Thus life has gone, from that day until the consummation of the age. 81 PHOENIXES, WATER ANIMALS, BULLS OF EGYPT Then when Sophia Zoe saw that the rulers of darkness cursed her compan- ions, she was angry. And when she came out of the first heaven with every power, she chased the rulers from their heavens, and she cast them down to the sinful world, that they might dwell there as evil demons upon the earth. She sent the bird that was in paradise so that, until the consummation of the age, it might spend the thousand years in the rulers' world: a vital living being with soul, called the phoenix, which kills itself and reanimates itself for a wit- ness to their judgment, because they dealt unjustly with Adam and his race. There are three human beings and their descendants in the world until the consummation of the age: the spiritual and the psychical and the earthly. This is like the three kinds of phoenixes of paradise: the first is immortal; the sec- ond attains one thousand years; as for the third, it is written in the Holy Book that it is consumed. Likewise three baptisms exist: the first is spiritual, the sec- ond is by fire, the third is by water. 80. See Genesis 3:21-24. 81.

And the worm that is brought forth from the phoenix is also a human being. It is written of it, \"The just will sprout like the phoenix.\" 84 The phoenix first appears alive, and dies, and rises again, as a sign of what appears at the consummation of the age. These great signs appeared only in Egypt, not in other lands, signifying that it is like the paradise of god. ERRORAND IGNORANCE ENTER HUMAN HISTORY Let us come back to the rulers of whom we spoke, that we might present an explanation of them. For when the seven rulers were cast from their heavens down upon the earth, they created for themselves angels, many demonic an- gels, to serve them. But these demons taught humankind many errors with magic and potions and idolatry, and shedding of blood, and altars, and tem- ples, and sacrifices, and libations to all the demons of the earth, having as their co-worker fate, 85 who came into being according to the agreement by the gods of injustice and justice. And thus when the world came into being, it wandered astray in distraction throughout all time. For all the people who are on the earth served the demons from the creation until the consumma- tion of the age—both the angels of justice and the people of injustice. Thus the world came to be in distraction and ignorance and stupor. They all erred, until the appearance of the true human. Enough for you to this point. Next we shall consider our world so that we might complete the discussion of its structure and its government in a precise manner. Then it will be clear how belief in hidden things, which have been ap- parent from the foundation to the consummation of the age, came about. 82.

I shall explain why the beings belonging to the immortal human are here. When a multi- tude of people came into being through Adam, who was fashioned, and from matter, and when the world was filled, the rulers reigned over it, that is to say, they held it in ignorance. What is the cause? It is this. Since the immortal fa- ther knows that deficiency of truth came into being among the eternal realms and their worlds, when he wanted to bring to naught the rulers of destruc- tion by means of their fashioned creatures, he sent your likenesses, namely, the blessed little guileless spirits, down to the world of destruction. 86 They are not strangers to knowledge. For all knowledge is in an angel who appears before them, who stands in front of the father and is not powerless to give them knowledge. Immediately, whenever they appear in the world of destruction, they will first reveal the pattern of incorruptibility for condem- nation of the rulers and their powers. Moreover, when the blessed ones ap- peared in the fashioned bodies of the authorities, they were envied. And because of envy, the authorities mixed their seed with them to defile them, but they were not able. Moreover, when the blessed ones appeared in their light, they appeared distinctively. And each one of them from their land re- vealed their knowledge to the assembly 87 that appeared in the fashioned bod- ies of destruction. The assembly was found to have every seed because of the seed of the authorities that was mixed with it. Then the savior made all of them one. 88 And the spirits of these appeared, being superior and blessed but varying in election, and many others are kingless and superior to everyone who was before them. Consequently, four races exist. There are three that be- long to the kings of the eighth heaven. But the fourth race is kingless and per- fect, above them all. For these will enter into the holy place of their father, and they will reside in rest, and eternal, ineffable glory, and ceaseless joy. They are already kings, immortal within the mortal realm. They will pass judgment on the gods of chaos and their powers. 86. These are spirits of light sent from the realm of light to enlighten gnostics in this world. They appear as revealers, in flesh. 87.

DERDEKEAS TELLS SHEM ABOUT THE POWERS OF THE UNIVERSE I heard a voice saying to me, \"Shem, since you are from an unmixed power and you are the first being upon the earth, hear and understand what I shall say to you first concerning the great powers who were in existence in the beginning before I appeared. There was light and darkness, and there was spirit between them. 6 Since your root fell into forgetfulness—that which was the uncon- ceived spirit—I reveal to you the truth about the powers. 7 The light was thought, full of attentiveness and reason; they were united into one form. And the darkness was wind in waters. He possessed the mind wrapped in chaotic fire. And the spirit between them was a gentle, humble light. These are the three roots. They reigned each in themselves, alone. And they covered each other, each one with its power. \"But the light, since he possessed great power, knew the abasement of the darkness and his disorder, namely, that the root was not straight. The crookedness of the darkness was lack of perception, namely, the illusion that there is no one above him. 8 And as long as he was able to restrain his evil, he was covered with the water. And he stirred. And the spirit was frightened by the sound. 9 He lifted himself up to his station, and he saw a great, dark water. And he was nauseated.

When he saw it he was astonished. He did not know that another power was above him. And when he saw that his likeness was dark compared with the spirit, he felt hurt. And in his pain he lifted up, above the height of the members of dark- ness, his mind, which was the eye of the bitterness of evil. He caused his mind to take shape in a member of the portions of the spirit, thinking that, by star- ing down at his evil, he would be able to equal the spirit. J l But he was not able, for he wanted to do an impossible thing, and it did not take place. But in order that the mind of darkness, which is the eye of the bitterness of evil, might not be destroyed, since he was made partially similar, he arose and shone with a fiery light upon all of Hades, 12 that the equality of the faultless light might be- come apparent. For the spirit benefited from every form of darkness because he appeared in his majesty. \"And the exalted, infinite light appeared, for he was very joyful. He wished to reveal himself to the spirit. And the likeness of the exalted light appeared to the unconceived spirit. I appeared. 13 1 am the son of the incorruptible, infinite light. I appeared in the likeness of the spirit, for I am the ray of the universal light. And his appearance to me was in order that the mind of darkness might not remain in Hades.

DARKNESS EJACULATES MIND INTO THE WOMB OF NATURE \"And when the darkness saw the womb, he became unchaste. And when he had aroused the water, he rubbed the womb. 15 His mind dissolved down to the depths of nature. It mingled with the power of the bitterness of darkness. And the womb's eye 16 ruptured at the wickedness in order that she might not again bring forth the mind. For it was a seed of nature from the dark root. And when nature had taken to herself the mind by means of the dark power, every likeness took shape in her. And when the darkness had acquired the likeness of the mind, it resembled the spirit. For nature rose up to expel it; she was powerless against it, since she did not have a form from the darkness. For she brought it forth in the cloud. And the cloud shone. A mind appeared in it like a frightful, harmful fire. The mind collided against the unconceived spirit, since it possessed a likeness from him, in order that nature might be- come empty of the chaotic fire. And immediately nature was divided into four parts. They became clouds that varied in their appearance. They were called hymen, afterbirth, power, and water. 17 And the hymen and the afterbirth and the power were chaotic fires. And the mind was drawn from the midst of the darkness and the water— since the mind was in the midst of nature and the dark power—in order that the harmful waters might not cling to it. Because of this, nature was divided, according to my will, in order that the mind may return to its power, which the dark root, mixed with the mind, had taken from it.

And the force of his astonishment cast off the burden. And it returned to its heat. It put on the light of the spirit. And when nature moved away from the power of the light of the spirit, the burden returned. And the astonishment of the light again cast off the burden. It stuck to the cloud of the hymen. 19 And all the clouds of darkness cried out, they who had separated from Hades, because of the alien power. \"This is the spirit of light who has come in them. And by the will of the majesty the spirit gazed up at the infinite light, that his light may be pitied and the likeness may be brought up from Hades. And when the spirit had looked, I flowed out—I, the son of the majesty—like a wave of light and like a whirl- wind of the immortal spirit. And I blew from the cloud of the hymen upon the astonishment of the unconceived spirit. The cloud separated and cast light upon the clouds. These separated so that the spirit might return. Because of this the mind took shape. Its rest was shattered. For the hymen of nature was a cloud that cannot be grasped; it is a great fire. Similarly, the afterbirth of na- ture is the cloud of silence; it is an august fire. And the power that was mixed with the mind—it, too, was a cloud of nature that was joined with the dark- ness that had aroused nature to unchastity. And the dark water was a frightful cloud. And the root of nature, which was below, was crooked, since it is bur- densome and harmful. The root was blind to the bound light, which was un- fathomable because it had many appearances.

What he was granted by the infinite light was given so that in all his members he might appear as a single image of light. And when the spirit arose above the water, his dark likeness be- came apparent.

It shed the first power, which it had taken from the spirit—that which shone on him from the be- ginning, before I appeared in the word to the spirit. The cloud would not have been able to tolerate both of them. And the light that came forth from the cloud passed through silence until it came into the middle region. And by the will of the majesty, the light mixed with him, that is, the spirit that ex- ists in silence, which had been separated from the spirit of light. It was sepa- rated from the light by the cloud of silence. The cloud was disturbed. It was he who gave rest to the flame of fire. He humbled the dark womb that she might not reveal other seed from the darkness. He kept them back in the middle region of nature in their position, which was in the cloud.

And the shock of its astonishment cast off the burden of the cloud. It was evil, since it was unclean.

A DISTURBANCE UNDOES THE POWER OF NATURE \"O Shem, the disturbance that occurred at my wish happened so that nature might become empty. 45 For the wrath of the darkness subsided. O Shem, the mouth of darkness was shut. No longer does the light that shone for the world appear in it, according to my will. And when nature had said that its wish was fulfilled, then every form was engulfed by the waters in prideful ignorance. Nature turned her dark vagina and cast from her the power of fire, which was in her from the beginning through the rubbing of the darkness. It lifted itself up and shone upon the whole world instead of the righteous one. And all her forms sent forth a power like a flame of fire up to heaven as a help to the cor- rupted light, which had lifted itself up. For they were members of the chaotic fire. And she did not know that she had harmed herself. When she cast forth the power, the power that she possessed, she cast it forth from the genitals. The demon, who is a deceiver, stirred up the womb in every form. \"And in her ignorance, as if she were doing a great thing, she granted the demons and the winds a star each. For without wind and star nothing happens upon the earth. For every power is filled by them after they were released from the darkness and the fire and the power and the light. For in the place where their darkness and their fire were mixed with each other, beasts were brought forth. And in the place of the darkness and the fire, and the power of the mind, and the light, human beings came into existence. Being from the spirit, the thought of the light, my eye, does not exist in every person. For before the flood came from the winds and the demons, rain came to people. But then, in order that the power that is in the tower might be brought forth and might rest upon the earth, nature, which had been disturbed, wanted to harm the seed that will be upon the earth after the flood. Demons were sent to them, and a deviation of the winds, and a burden of the angels, and a fear of the prophet, a condemnation of speech, that I may teach you, O Shem, from what blindness your race is protected.

For when you appear in the world, dark nature will shake against you, together with the winds and a demon, that they may destroy the insight. But you, proclaim quickly to the Sodomites your universal teaching, for they are your members. For the demon of human form will part from that place by my will, since he is ignorant. He will guard this utterance. But the Sodomites, according to the will of the majesty, will bear witness to the universal testimony. They will rest with a pure conscience in the place of their repose, which is the unconceived spirit. And as these things will hap- pen, Sodom will be burned unjustly by a base nature. For the evil will not cease in order that your majesty may reveal that place. \"Then the demon will depart with faith. And then he will appear in the four regions of the world.

(If Jesus is assumed to be a manifestation of Seth, that mighi begin to help explain the title of the text.) The Second Treatise of the Great Seth is a gnostic meditation, presented as a revelation of Christ, on the meaning of the life and particularly the death of Jesus the anointed, and the relationship be- tween gnostic believers and the emerging orthodox church. The meditation has Jesus tell the story of his career: his beginnings in the divine assembly, his descent into this world and adoption of a body, his deal- ings with the cosmic rulers of this world, his crucifixion—or what seemed to be his crucifixion—and finally his ascent back home to the divine fullness. As in the Coptic Revelation of Peter, the Nag Hammadi text that follows the Sec- ond Treatise of the Great Seth in Codex VII, the heavenly Christ's death is said to have never happened. Jesus was thought by some to have suffered and died, but the rulers got the wrong man. The Second Treatise of the Great Seth says (rather like Basilides, according to Irenaeus of Lyon) that Simon of Cyrene (who in Mark 15:21, Matthew 27:32, and Luke 23:26 is enlisted to help Jesus carry the cross) was involved in events leading up to the crucifixion, and that another—perhaps Simon, perhaps the body that Jesus adopted—"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"466  LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM was crucified, while Jesus stood above it all, laughing at the ignorance and foolishness of the rulers.

The present text also polemicizes against \"those who think that they are advancing the name of Christ\" but end up persecuting the gnostics, who, Jesus says, \"have been liberated by me.\" These hostile people in the emerging orthodox church, the text claims, are confused in their christology, and they proclaim \"a doctrine of a dead man,\" according to which they believe, quite mistakenly, that they should worship, follow, and imitate a dead, crucified Christ. Unlike the gnostics, Jesus observes, they do not have \"the knowledge of the greatness that it is from above and from a fountain of truth.\" The Second Treatise of the Great Seth is another text from the Nag Ham- madi library, and like other texts in the collection it was composed in Greek. Gregory Riley suggests a date of composition in the second half of the second century, in part on the basis of the characterization of the opponents in the emerging orthodox church as small (or, few, of little account) and ignorant (or uninstructed). He guesses that Alexandria may be a possible place of com- position. The Second Treatise of the Great Seth does not give a systematic treatment of its gnostic themes, but some ideas of Sethian and Valentinian character may be identified.

And there was a flight of their mind about what they would counsel concerning me, thinking that their own greatness is all, and speaking false witness, moreover, against the human and the whole greatness of the assembly. 11 It was not possible for them to know who is the father of truth, the human of greatness. They took the name because of contact with ignorance—which is a burning and a vessel created to destroy Adam, whom they had made, in order to cover up those who are theirs in the same way. But they, the rulers, of the place of Yaldabaoth, reveal the realm of the angels, which human beings were seeking because they did not know the human of truth.

And thus did their thought come to be removed outside the majesty of the heavens, away from the human of truth, whose name they saw, since he is in a small dwelling place. They are foolish and senseless in their empty thought, namely, their laughter, and it was contagion for them. The whole greatness of the fatherhood of the spirit was at rest in its places.

There was a trembling that overcame the chaos of the earth, for the souls that were in the sleep below were released, and they arose.

Therefore they knew what I was saying, for we took counsel about the destruction of the rulers. And therefore I did the will of the father, who is I.

It is I who bear witness that it was ludicrous, since the rulers do not know that this is an ineffable union of undefiled truth, as exists among the children of light, of which they made an imitation, having pro- claimed a doctrine of a dead man and lies so as to resemble the freedom and purity of the perfect assembly, and having joined themselves in their doctrine to fear and slavery, worldly cares, and abandoned worship, being small and ig- norant, since they do not contain the nobility of the truth. For they hate the one in whom they are and love the one in whom they are not. For they did not know the knowledge of the greatness that it is from above and from a fountain of truth and not from slavery and jealousy, fear, and love of worldly matter. For that which is not theirs and that which is theirs they use fearlessly and freely.

In the Gospel of Mary she is said to be loved by Jesus more than the other followers, but Peter and Andrew wonder whether she can be taken seri- ously as a female teacher of revelatory wisdom. This dispute between Mary and the male followers of Jesus reflects the argument between gnostics and representatives of the emerging orthodox church about whether women can teach in church and whether private revelatory teachings can have the same authority as the official teachings of the priests and bishops. After six missing pages, the Gospel of Mary introduces Jesus speaking about sin, and Jesus proclaims that sin is not an ethical problem but rather a cosmological problem, as Karen L.

Thereafter Mary recounts a vision of the soul's ascent beyond four cosmic powers (perhaps the four elements), in a passage that unfortunately is largely missing from the manuscript.

Like many gnostics, the Naassenes apparently sought spiritual truths from a variety of sources. Hippolytus claims that they were especially attracted to the mystery religions of antiquity and late antiquity, which typi- cally stressed mystical experience in the context of a dying and rising deity and which the Naassenes interpreted in such a way as to elucidate their own beliefs. These were alternative forms of religion in a post-Olympian world. When the Olympian gods and goddesses no longer captured the hearts and minds of people, many turned for their religious experience to the myster- ies of Demeter and Kore; or Dionysos; or the Great Mother and Attis, the Phrygian fertility god; or Isis and Osiris; or Mithras—or Jesus Christ, whom people like Clement of Alexandria understood to be a deity of Christian mysteries. The Naassenes, according to Hippolytus, attended the mystery celebra- tions—for example, the mysteries of the Great Mother and Attis—to gain insights into religious knowledge and life. In presenting materials on the Naassenes, Hippolytus cites hymns to Attis and a Naassene sermon that ex- plains how themes from the mysteries contribute to their understanding of their own religion of gnosis. As Hippolytus portrays the Naassenes, he notes two sayings (one of which, he explicitly says, comes from the Gospel of"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"LITERATURE OF GNOSTIC WISDOM 483 Thomas) that constitute alternative versions of Gospel of Thomas 4 and 11; the parallel to Gospel of Thomas 11 is in the translation below. Many of the ex- planations in the sermon are based on suggested—and forced—proof texts and etymologies in the text. The two hymns and the sermon given here are taken from Hippolytus's Refutation of All Heresies 5.6.3-11.1 (see also 10.9.1-3). Another hymn is quoted at Refutation of All Heresies 5.9.9: I shall sing of Attis, son of Rhea, not with the clang of bells nor with the flute, nor with the bellowing of the Kouretes of Ida, but I shall tune it to the muse of Phoebus's lyre.

This is the \"god who dwells in the flood waters,\" according to the psalm book, and who mumbles and cries out \"from many waters.\" 27 The \"many waters\" is the manifold race of people from which he shouts and cries to the unimprinted human, saying, \"Save my only daughter from the lions.\" 28 To him was said, \"You are my child, Israel.

I have painted you on my hands.\" 30 And concerning his ascent, which is the regeneration by which he becomes spiritual and not carnal, scripture says, Let your rulers lift up the gates, and be lifted up, eternal gates, and the king of glory will enter. 31 This is the wonder of wonders, for \"who is this king of glory?\" 32 \"A worm and no man, the reproach of a man and the one rejected by the people.\" 33 \"This is the king of glory, the one mighty in war.\" 34 \"War\" means the war in the body, for the creature was formed out of conflicting elements. As it is writ- ten, \"Remember the war\"—which takes place in the body. 35 Jacob saw this en- trance and this gate when he went into Mesopotamia, when he passed from childhood to youth and manhood. Mesopotamia is the course of the great ocean, flowing from the midst of the perfect human. And he marveled at the heavenly gate, saying, \"How fearful is this place. It is no other than the house of god, and this is the gate of heaven.\" 36 For this reason Jesus says,\" I am the true gate.\" 37 He who speaks in this way is the perfect being, imprinted from above from the unimprinted one.

FROM CORPSE TO GOD The Phrygians also call him corpse, because he is buried in the body as in a sepulcher and tomb. This is the meaning of \"You are whitened tombs, full of dead men's bones within, since there is no living man among you,\" 42 and again, \"the dead will come forth from the sepulchers,\" 43 from the earthly bod- ies, being regenerated as spiritual beings, not carnal. This is the resurrection that takes place through the gate of the heavens. All those who do not enter through it remain dead. The Phrygians call him god when he has been transformed. He becomes god when he rises from the dead and through such a gate enters into heaven. The messenger Paul knew this gate. He half opened it in a mystery and said that he had been seized by an angel and \"taken to the second and third heaven, to paradise itself,\" where he saw what he saw, and \"heard ineffable words that a man is not allowed to relate.\" 44 These are the ineffable mysteries of which all people speak, \"which we speak in words taught not by human wisdom but by the spirit, by explaining spiritual matters to the spiritual. The psychical people do not accept what belongs to the spirit of god. To them it is nonsense.\" 45 These are the ineffable mysteries of the spirit, which we alone know.

Through them the whole universe is com- pleted. 52 Through them it began to come into existence. This is the meaning of the saying, \"The sower went out to sow, and some seed fell by the way and were trodden down. Others fell on rocky ground and sprang up and, because they had no depth, withered and died. And others fell on beautiful and good ground and produced fruit—one into a hundred, another into sixty, another into thirty. Whoever has ears to hear should hear.\" 53 This signifies that no one has been a hearer of these mysteries except the perfect gnostics alone. This is the beautiful and good that Moses mentions, \"I will lead you into a beautiful and good land, into a land flowing with milk and honey.\" 54 Honey and milk are what the perfect ones taste to become kingless and to share in the pleroma. The pleroma is that through which all created beings come into existence and are completed from the uncreated. STERILE The Phrygians also give him the name sterile. He is sterile when he is fleshly and performs the \"lust of the flesh.\" 55 This is what is meant by \"every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is cut down and cast into fire.\" 56 The fruits are only the rational, the living people, who enter through the third gate.

This is the meaning of \"Do not cast what is holy to the dogs, or pearls to swine.\" 58 The work of swine and dogs is the intercourse of woman with man. GOATHERD The Phrygians also call him goatherd, 59 not because he feeds goats, as the psy- chical people call them, but because he is ever turning, 60 always turning and circulating and impressing the whole universe with turning motion. For to turn 61 is to circulate and alter matters. That is why the two centers of the heaven are called poles. And the poet also said, An old man, wave dwelling, frequently comes around here, deathless Proteus, the Egyptian. 62 Poleitai does not mean that he is sold but that he turns about and goes around. Furthermore, cities 63 in which we live are so called because we turn and circu- late 64 in them. So the Phrygians call aipolos the one who always turns things in every direction and transfers them to his own domain. FERTILE The Phrygians also call him fertile, because \"the children of the deserted woman are more than those of the one who has a husband.\" 65 They are those who are reborn immortal and endure forever, even though few of them are born. All carnal beings are perishable, even though very many of them are born. That is why \"Rachel wept for her children and did not want to be com- forted for them, for she knew that they were no longer.\" 66 Jeremiah too mourns for the Jerusalem below, not the city in Phoenicia, but the perishable 58.

It was Jeremiah who said, \"He is human, and who will know him?\" 68 This shows how deep and difficult it is to comprehend the knowledge of the perfect being. The knowledge of the human being is the beginning of perfection, while finished perfection is the knowledge of god. HARVESTED GREEN SHEAF The Phrygians also call him the harvested green sheaf. According to them the Athenians give him the same name when they hold Eleusinian initiations and silently show the initiates the great, wondrous, and perfect mystery of the har- vested sheaf. For the Athenians this sheaf is the perfect torch, which comes from the unimprinted one. So the hierophant declares that he is not castrated like Attis, but has become a eunuch by means of hemlock and has given up all carnal generation. By night in Eleusis in full light he performs the vital and in- effable mystery and cries out, \"Brimo has borne a holy child, Brimos!\" This signifies that the powerful woman has borne a powerful child. Holy is the spir- itual generation, and heavenly and high. One born into it is powerful. This mystery is called Eleusis, and it occurs at the sanctuary 69 of Demeter. It is Eleusis because we the spiritual have come from above, floating down from Adamas; 70 anaktoreion is from \"ascending above.\" 71 This is what the Eleusin- ian initiates call the great mysteries. It is law that those who are initiated into the lesser mysteries should later be initiated into the great ones. For greater lots acquire greater parts. 72 The lesser mysteries are those of Persephone below. Concerning these mysteries and the way that leads there, \"broad and spacious,\" 73 and taking the destroyed ones to Persephone, the poet said, Beneath her is a horrible pathway, hollow and muddy. It is excellent to lead to the lovely grove of Aphrodite who is much honored. 74 67. John 3:5. 68. Jeremiah 17:9. 69. Greek anaktoreion. 70. In Greek eleusesthai means \"come.\" 71.

It is re- served for the spiritual people alone, and those who come there must put on the wedding garments and all become bridegrooms, made male by the vir- ginal spirit. 75 She is the virgin who is pregnant and conceives and bears a son, 76 a son who is not psychical or corporeal but is the blessed aeon of aeons. Concerning these matters the savior expressly said, \"Narrow and strait is the way that leads to life, and there are few who enter it. But broad and spacious is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.\" 77 ALMOND AND FLUTE PLAYER The Phrygians also say that the father of all is an almond, 78 not the tree, but that preexistent almond that has within itself the perfect fruit, palpitating and moving in its interior. It tore open its own womb and brought forth its in- visible and unnamable and ineffable child, of whom we are speaking. To tear open 79 is to tear open and cut through, just as physicians call scarifications 80 the incisions that they make in inflamed bodies or in those that contain some tumor. So the Phrygians call almond the being from which the invisible one came forth and was begotten, and \"through whom everything came into exis- tence and apart from him the nonexistent was made.\" 81 The being so born is called flute player, because what was born is a harmonious breath or spirit. \"God is a spirit. Therefore the true worshipers will worship neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem, but in spirit.\" 82 The worship of the perfect ones is spiritual, not carnal. The spirit is there where the father and the son are named, the son born of the father. He is the many-named one, many-eyed, in- comprehensible, toward which every nature strives, and each in its own way. 75. See Gospel of Thomas 114. 76. Isaiah 7:14. 77. Matthew 7:13-14. 78.

These extraordinary writings, from the middle of the first through the end of the third centuries, make up a collection known as the Corpus Hermeticum or the Hermetica. They often deal with the occult sciences—alchemy, astrology, magic, and spiritual information—and reflect a hellenistic breakdown blurring science and religion. These writings are known as \"hermetic\" because of their patron and au- thor, Hermes Trismegistos, Hermes the thrice-greatest, the Greek incarnation of his Egyptian counterpart, the god Thoth. The images of Thoth and Hermes merge. Thoth was creator and orderer of the universe; god of magic, wisdom, and knowledge; inventor of writing; scribe of the gods and author of all scrip- tures; lord of the moon; and also giver of the first word, the logos. Both he and Hermes were believed to be master magicians of great sophistication. Thoth gave Isis knowledge how to realize the resurrection of her son Osiris, which served as a model for the later myth of Jesus' resurrection. Hermes was the in- tellectual, the patron of the arts, and the speaker in platonic dialogues that voice his philosophy and spiritual flight. The extant texts of Hermes Trismegistos are seventeen Greek treatises of the Corpus Hermeticum, diverse fragments in the anthology of Ioannes Stobaios, a Latin translation of Asklepios found in the works of Apuleius, and texts from Codex VI of the Nag Hammadi library. They may point to a single person as editor, collector, or author of some of the major works, in- cluding Poimandres.

On the contrary, these hermetic writings have the character of sacred scripture of unknown authorship typically ascribed falsely to a patriarchal figure or god—Thoth and Hermes—all of which confirms that the great name was chosen to help the work find entry into a sacred canon. These nominal uncertainties, how- ever, in no way diminish the texts. The Greek epics—the Bible of classical re- ligion—are not dulled because the twentieth century has questioned their traditional authorship. In the end, the author of major religious works has historically blurred into a tradition, not a named person. Such has been the fate of the sayings of Lao-tzu, Buddha, and probably Jesus in, for instance, the Gospel of Thomas. Such anonymity has been the interesting fate of the thrice-greatest Hermes. THE HERMETIC MIX Into the hermetic mix goes the rich influx of eastern religious elements, mys- tery religions, and the neopythagorean and neoplatonic philosophies of late hellenistic times. Much of the work is gnostic in character. The Corpus Her- meticum coincides with classical Christian gnostic texts not in Yahweh and Jesus, the central characters of the Bible; not in their transcendental tales or in the myths or even in the diction. These schools meet in the common central- ity of gnosis, which is knowledge of the soul. Through gnosis, revealed in the self, one finds the divine. Through gnosis the spirit or soul ascends united to the divine. The Alexandrian platonists—Philo, a Jew, and Plotinos, an Egypt- ian pagan, both writing in Greek—contributed hugely to the gnostic pot, even when, in the instance of Plotinos, he wrote against the gnostics. The similari- ties of Plotinian mystical union with the soul's sun and the gnostic knowledge of the divine spark inside, ascending to the sky of inner light, easily belie the Egyptian philosopher's refutation of the gnostics. Even the metaphors \"soul sun\" and \"divine spark inside\" are almost identical in rhetorical phrase and philosophical meaning. The jewel of the hermetic tradition is Poimandres.

Although the author (or authors) of Poimandres, probably composed and compiled at the end of the second century CE, is aware of Judaism and"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"HERMETIC LITERATURE 499 Christianity, this syncretic work remains basically pagan, deriving from Egyptian platonism and contemporary Alexandrian theologies. THE LEGACY OF HERMES TRISMEGISTOS By ancient tradition, confirmed by Lactantius in the fourth century, these ec- static tracts derive from the occult books of an ancient Egyptian sage who lived shortly after Moses. The word hermetic also carries an exotic lexical life of its own. Since Hermes is commonly seen as the Greek incarnation of Thoth and is identified with his attributes, those mysterious, hermetic writings of the Corpus Hermeticum became seen as the work of a secret Egyptian seer, a no- tion persisting from before Augustine, who took this to be a fact, and down to Giordano Bruno in the Renaissance. The mystery surrounding this Egyptian seer or thrice-greatest Hermes contributed to his long afterlife in religion and literature and in scientific tracts on astrology, medicine, and alchemy, in Greek, Latin, Arabic, Italian, French, and English from antiquity to our own times. Hermes, after leaving the dark- ness of the physical universe where he has been trapped in nature, ascends through seven levels of spirituality to the realm of light and to immersion in the androgynous parent of all, a divine hermaphrodite (Hermes merged with Aphrodite). There he becomes god. Hermes' figure of Poimandres, through gnosis, presages the paths of later mystics, who partake in similar techniques and experiences but who are not seen as gnostics. Like Philo's ladders of spiri- tual ascent, these non-gnostic paths include Pseudo-Dionysios's diving gloom and ray of blackness, and John of the Cross's paradoxical ways of oblivion in which, like the gnostics, he dies from ordinary time, moves from sensations of the body into the soul, to vision in darkness, which is illumination, and to union, which is an ineffable ecstasy and another oblivion. The hermetic writ- ings have suited a fusion of writers looking elsewhere (the literal sense of ec- stasy, from ex-histanai, \"stand out of place\"), including William Blake and his mentor Thomas Taylor, who first introduced Blake to the neoplatonists and to the hermetic texts. In H.D.'s epic Trilogy, written in London during World War II, the second book, Tribute to the Angels, begins with an invocation to Thoth / Hermes / Mercury, the \"angel\" about whom the remainder of the book revolves: Hermes Trismegistus is patron of alchemists;"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"500 HERMETIC LITERATURE his province is thought, inventive, artful and curious; his metal is quicksilver, his clients, orators, thieves and poets. 1 In other gnostic works the soul (psyche) is of a lower order than spirit (pneuma), and soul is associated with earthbound entities, particularly with the biblical creator god. But in Poimandres, soul rather than spirit designates the highest divine quality of anthropos, or earthly man: both nous and psyche refer to this higher meaning. As in other gnostic texts, primal or first man (or human) descends through the cosmos to the earth, where he mingles with darkness and matter; that is, he becomes trapped in nature. To be free of that darkness, he must abhor the senses, the body, all matter. After death, the soul's ascent back through the sphere is a privilege of the select. After first man's cosmic fall, a human being returns to become one with god. Hans Jonas points out that the myth of cosmic return after death was transformed in neoplatonic and Judeo-Christian mysticism into a technique of spiritual ascent while alive and in the body. We see this phenomenon, of course, in Plotinos, the last original neoplatonist, and in the practices of shamans and mystics, east and west, whose principal aim is ecstatic transcendence. Jonas summarizes brilliantly: In a later stage of \"gnostic\" development (though no longer passing under the name of Gnosticism) the external topology of the ascent through the spheres, with the successive divesting of the soul of its worldly envelopments and the regaining of its original acosmic nature, could be \"internalized\" and find its ana- logue in a psychological technique of inner transformations by which the self, while still in the body, might attain the Absolute as an immanent, if temporary, condition. An ascending scale of mental states replaces the stations of the mythical itinerary: the dynamics of progressive spiritual self-transformations, the spa- tial thrust through the heavenly spheres. Thus could transcen- dence itself be turned into immanence, the whole process become spiritualized and put within the power and the orbit of i.

With this transposition of a mythological scheme into the inwardness of the person, with the translation of its ob- jective stages into subjective phases of self-performable experi- ence whose culmination has the form of ecstasis, gnostic myth has passed into mysticism (Neoplatonic and monastic), and in this new medium it lives on long after the disappearance of the original mythological beliefs. 2 The writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistos, and of Plotinos and Pseudo-Dionysios, have been a prime source for the occult as well as for or- thodox religious mysticism in the Western world. Plotinos was a historical Greek from Egypt; Dionysius a Christian, probably a fifth-century Syrian monk; while Hermes Trismegistos has the aura of a mysterious visionary, a lunatic in the eyes of skeptics, a demigod to the faithful. All these human and divine attributes are intriguing and peculiar, since, in all probability, he was nobody at all; that is, he was a resonant name to replace a major hellenistic religious tradition. The lessons in that tradition are universal. We are lone figures alienated on the earth from others, from sectarian and secular groups, even from our souls. Through gnosis, however, one's solitude becomes the springboard to a greater companionship, for a vision of and union with a spirit, which, depending on system and translation of terms, is god, or the one, or nothing or all. 2.

The speaker in the ^fctetaaa*^ Socratic dialogue, Poimandres, proposes a severely dualistic view of life in which the body represents everything dark, deceptive, temporal, and mortal while the mind {nous) represents light, truth, timelessness, and eternal salvation. The purpose of life is to free the soul from the prison of the body through gnosis and to return to the heavenly realm of light. So one leaves the physical universe by embarking on a celestial journey, through seven lev- els of spirituality, until one comes to the father of all. Then \"he enters the eighth sphere of the fixed star\" and becomes god. It is notable that for the her- meticists, god, despite the title \"father of all,\" is androgynous and contains both sexes. In the Revelation of Asklepios, 1 a hermetic text not included in this volume, god is defined as bisexual. Poimandres has three sections. The first section, which tells of the creation of the world and human life, is a hermetic cosmogony and anthropogony, revealed to the speaker as a visionary experience. Part two recounts the soul's escape from the world and its ascent to heaven and mystical union with god; the final part contains instructions for proselytizing the gospel of gnosis. The work ends with a prayer. i. The Revelation of Asklepios is a Hermetic dialogue between Hermes and Asklepios. It exists in Latin translation from a lost Greek original, dated in the second century, entitled Perfect Teaching (Logos teleios).

We soon understand that Poimandres is the nous, the highest godhead. The creations or divine emana- tions of the father of all are the logos, the mind-demiurge (who in turn creates the planetary system and the physical world in which people are trapped), and anthropos (human being). The human appears in god's image, since it is an androgynous generative principle and contains a divine soul, a spark of light. In Poimandres we have perhaps the earliest full and detailed instructions in the mystical experience of darkness and purification from matter, ascent to the light, and entry into a oneness with god; this map of spiritual ecstasy was to be imitated, or reproduced in other forms, in innumerable works thereafter. POIMANDRES 2 POIMANDRES APPEARS Once when I began to think about the things that are, and my thoughts soared exceedingly high, and my bodily senses were held down by sleep like people weighed down by overeating and weariness, I thought I saw a being of vast and boundless magnitude coming toward me, who called me by name, and said, \"What do you wish to hear and see, to learn and know?\" \"Who are you?\" I said. \"I am Poimandres,\" he said, \"the mind 3 of absolute power. I know what you want and I am with you everywhere.\" \"I want to learn about the things that are, their nature, and to know god,\" I replied. \"How I want to hear!\" He said, \"Keep in mind what you wish to learn and I will teach you.\" THE VISION OF CREATION With these words he changed his form, and in a flash everything opened be- fore me and I saw an unbounded vista. All was light, a soothing and happy light. And as I gazed I was entranced. But soon a stark and terrifying darkness descended gradually like a coiled snake, and I saw the darkness turn into a 2.

And after that an inarticulate cry like the voice of fire. Out of the light a holy word 5 descended upon the watery substance, and I thought this word the voice of light; and unmingled fire leapt out of the wa- tery substance and soared upward. The fire was quick and violent, and the air, being light, followed the breath 6 as it rose from earth and water to the fire, so that the breath seemed suspended from the fire. But the earth and water re- mained intermingled, and the earth could not be seen apart from the water. All these elements were kept in audible motion by the breath of the word hov- ering above them. POIMANDRES IS LIGHT AND MIND Then Poimandres asked me, \"Do you understand what that vision means?\" \"I will understand,\" I said. \"I am that light,\" he said, \"and I am the mind, the first god, who existed be- fore the watery substance appeared out of the darkness. And the luminous word that issued from the mind is the son of god.\" \"In what way?\" \"Understand that what sees and hears inside you is the word of the lord, its son, but the mind is god the father. And they are not divided one from the other, for they are united by life.\" \"Thank you,\" I said. \"But think about the light, and understand it.\" WHERE EVERYTHING COMES FROM Having said this, he gazed intently at me for a long time, and I trembled at his aspect. When I raised my head I saw in my mind the light, consisting of innu- merable powers, which had become a limitless cosmos, and the fire, contained by a mighty power, was held in place.

The watery substance of nature received the word and made itself into an orderly world from its diverse elements, and a brood of living crea- tures came forth. ANOTHER MIND, THE DEMIURGE \"And the first mind, being both male and female, both life and light, conceived through the word another mind, the demiurge, and this second mind of fire and breath fashioned seven rulers, who encompass within their orbits the world perceived by the senses. Their government is called destiny. 7 \"Suddenly, the word of god leaped out of the downward-moving ele- ments of nature to the pure body of heaven and was united with the mind of the demiurge. For the word was of one substance with the mind. And the lower elements of nature were left wordless, 8 that is, without reason, and be- came mere matter. \"Now the demiurge-mind worked together with the word to encompass the spheres of the rulers and to whirl them with thunderous speed, with no fixed beginning or determined end, since their revolutions begin where they end. And according to the mind's will, the lower elements of nature became animals devoid of reason, for they did not have the word. And the air brought forth winged creatures, and the water brought forth fish, and by then earth and water were separated from each other according to the will of the mind. And earth brought forth four-footed creatures and creeping things and wild and tame beasts.

And god was very pleased with his own beauty in the primal person 9 and delivered to him all that he had created. \"And the primal person took station in the highest sphere of heaven and observed the things made by its author, his brother the demiurge, who ruled over the region of fire. Now that the human had seen those things made in fire, he wished to create things of his own. And his father permitted him to do so. And since the rulers loved him too, each gave him a share of his own nature. \"When the human learned their characteristics, he wished to break through the bounding orbits of the rulers and to share the power of him who rules over the fire. THE HUMAN DESCENDS INTO THE WORLD OF NATURE \"Then the primal person, who possessed all authority over the world of mor- tal creatures and irrational animals, leaned down through the harmony 10 and, having broken the vault, showed lower nature the beautiful form of god. When nature saw the beautiful form of god, it smiled on the human with love, for it had seen the wondrous beauty of the human reflected in the water and its shadow on the earth. And the human too, on seeing this form, a form similar to his own reflected in the water, loved it and wanted to live in it. And his wish was immediately realized, and he began to inhabit a form devoid of reason. And nature received its loved one, embraced him, and they mingled, for they were lovers. HUMANKIND IS MORTAL AND IMMORTAL \"And this is why the human, of all creatures on the earth, is twofold: mortal in his body but immortal through the eternal human. Though he is immor- tal and has power over all things, he also suffers mortality, since he is subject to destiny. Though above the world of the spheres, he is a slave of destiny. Though he is male and female, 11 being born of a father who contains male and female, and is sleepless as his father is sleepless, he is vanquished by love and oblivion.\" 10.

The human had in himself the world of spheres of the seven rulers, which, as I told you, was made of fire and air. Nature immediately made seven humans corresponding to the natures of the seven rulers, and they were androgynous and sublime.\" Then I said, \"O Poimandres, a powerful desire has seized me and I want to hear more. Do not stop.\" \"Silence,\" Poimandres replied. \"I have not yet finished with the first discourse.\" \"See, I am silent,\" I said. \"These seven humans were born as follows: nature brought forth their bodies. Earth was the female element, water the generative male element; from fire came their nature, from ether their spirit. 12 Nature brought forth their bodies in human likeness.

MALE AND FEMALE ARE CREATED \"Now I will tell you what you long to hear. When that era was completed, the bond uniting all things was loosened by god's will. All living creatures, being androgynous, were suddenly divided into two, and the primal person became at once male and female.

Did I not tell you to pay attention?\" \"I understand and remember, and at the same time I thank you.\" \"If you understand, tell me why those who are ignorant deserve death.\" \"Because the material body has its source in the abhorrent darkness, from which came the watery substance of which the body is composed in the sensi- ble world, and from this body death slakes its thirst.\" \"You have understood correctly. But why is it, as the word of god has it, that whoever recognizes and knows himself enters into the good?\" 17 I answered, \"Because the father of all consists of light and life, and from him human beings were born.\" \"You are right. Light and life are god and father, out of which humans came. And if you learn that you are also made of light and life, you will return to light and life.\" These things Poimandres said. THE PLACE OF THE MIND AMONG THE GODLY AND GODLESS \"But tell me,\" I said, \"how I shall come into life, for god told me, 'Let the think- ing person know himself.' Don't all people have a mind?\" \"Do not speak that way, for I, mind, am present to the holy and good and pure and merciful, and my presence is a help to them, and all at once they rec- ognize everything and win the mercy of loving god, and thank him and praise him and sing hymns to him, and turn to him with devotion. And before they abandon the body to death, they loathe the bodily senses, since they know how they work. I, the mind, will not allow the workings of the body to attain their purpose. As a guardian of the gates, I bar the way to evil and shameful ener- gies. I cut off their strategies. 17.

Never ceasing his dark struggle, and giving in to boundless ap- petite, he inflicts upon himself greater torment and hotter fire.\" THE ASCENT OF THE SOUL THROUGH SEVEN ZONES \"Mind, you have instructed me well in all things. But tell me more about the ascent. How shall I come to life?\" At this Poimandres said, \"First, with the dissolution of your material body, you yield your character to the demon. Your image vanishes. The bodily senses return to their own sources, becoming part of the cosmos, and, combined in new ways, do other work. And anger and desire enter thoughtless nature. \"And then man rises into the harmony, the world of the spheres. In the first zone he leaves behind the force to grow and decrease, in the second the machinations of evil, in the third the guile of lust, in the fourth his domi- neering arrogance, in the fifth his unholy daring and rashness, in the sixth his striving for wealth by evil means, and in the seventh zone the malicious lie: all rendered powerless.

They move in order up to the father. They surrender to the powers, and become the powers, and are in god. This is the good, the aim of those who have gnosis: to become god. \"Why then do you hesitate?

GOING FORTH TO PREACH I thanked and blessed the father of all, and was sent forth, empowered and in- structed concerning the nature of all and with a supreme vision. And I began to preach to the people of beauty, of piety and gnosis: \"O people born of the earth, given over to drunkenness and sleep and ignorance of god, end your drunkenness and unreasoning sleep.\" When they heard this, they gathered around me. I said, \"Why have you ac- cepted death when you have been given the power to enjoy immortality? Change your ways, you who walk with error and keep company with igno- rance. Free yourself of darkness and seize the light. Abandon corruption and receive immortality.\" And some of them mocked me and left me, for they had given themselves to death. But others begged me to teach them, and they threw themselves at my feet. I raised them up and became a guide to people, teaching them the word and how they might be saved. And I sowed words of wisdom in them, and they were nourished with ambrosial water. When evening came and the rays of sun began to fade, I called on them to thank god. And when they com- pleted the thanksgiving, each sought his or her own bed. 20 I recorded the beneficence of Poimandres, and how my hopes had been fulfilled. For the body's sleep became the soul's awakening, the closing of my eyes the true vision, my silence pregnant with the good, and my words the ex- pression of good things. And all this happened to me, since I had received it from my mind, that is, from Poimandres, the word and mind of absolute sov- ereignty. I became god-inspired, god-minded, and came with the truth.

Such an ascent is also described in the preceding text, Poimandres. The present text assumes the astronomical system of late antiq- uity that describes the heavens as consisting of seven spheres surrounding the earth and housing the sun, moon, and planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn). Beyond these spheres lies the divine. The eighth realm, astronomers thought, is the realm of the fixed stars, and the ninth realm is exalted beyond that. These realms are also depicted in the Secret Book of John, with the seven cosmic kings stationed in seven spheres of heaven, through the power of Yald- abaoth, and Sophia stationed in the ninth realm, above Yaldabaoth. According to the Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth, the student of knowledge has al- ready advanced through the lower stages of spiritual enlightenment. The stu- dent prays, perhaps with the teacher, \"Lord, grant us wisdom from your power that reaches us, that we may relate to ourselves the vision of the eighth and the ninth. Already we have advanced to the seventh, since we are pious and abide"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"HERMETIC LITERATURE 513 in your law.\" Further, the student mentions books that have been studied for their wisdom and understanding. The student's visionary ascent to the eighth and the ninth entails singing a hymn in silence and being united with the mind of all. The souls and the an- gels who inhabit the eighth likewise sing a hymn in silence, for they also offer praise to the mind of all, which dwells in the ninth. This mind is recognized through the mystical guidance of Hermes Trismegistos, who himself an- nounces, \"I am mind, and I see another mind, one that moves the soul.\" And the student declares, \"I am the instrument of your spirit, mind is your plec- trum, and your guidance makes music with us. I see myself! I have been strengthened by you, for your love has reached us.\" The result of this enlight- enment is wisdom, praise, ecstasy. In a way that recalls the Three Steles of Seth, the Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth includes instructions for preserving the text on turquoise steles. The Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth survives in Coptic in the Nag Hammadi library. Its title is supplied from the contents of the text. It was probably composed in Greek, very likely in Egypt, considering the references to turquoise steles with hieroglyphic characters to be placed at the temple at Diospolis (Magna or Parva) in Upper Egypt, and deities with faces of animals. Some scholars suggest a date of composition in the second century CE, on ac- count of similarities with the middle platonic philosopher Albinus.

These fasci- nating and tenacious people have maintained their traditions for nearly two thousand years, long after their better known gnostic \"cousins\" fell into ob- scurity. Although they have always been a relatively small community, the Mandaeans have produced an extremely rich body of rituals and texts writ- ten in Mandaic, an eastern dialect of Aramaic. Many of these traditions are unique, while others have parallels in gnosticism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, as well as in ancient Mesopotamian religions. Because of their geo- graphical isolation, their traditional wariness toward outsiders, and the lin- guistic and interpretive challenges posed by their literature, the Mandaeans have remained a mystery to all but a few scholars of religion. In recent years the Mandaean community has begun to remove its veils of seclusion. At the same time, a small but growing number of dedicated researchers has initiated a renaissance of interest in Mandaean studies. ORIGINS AND HISTORY The origins of Mandaeism, like other branches of gnosticism, have long been debated. Mandaean literature and oral traditions preserve a number of in- triguing references to the roots of the community. These combine mytholog- ical, biblical, and historical elements. Like all gnostics, the Mandaeans trace their ultimate ancestry to the world of light (in Mandaic, alma dnhura, an analogue to the pleroma). The Mandaean anthropogony echoes both rabbinic and gnostic accounts. Ptahil, the demiurge, creates the earthly Adam, who re- mains inanimate until the soul of his heavenly prototype, called Adakas (a"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"528 MANDAEAN LITERATURE contraction of Adam Kasya, \"hidden Adam\"), is brought into his inert body from the world of light. In another version of the myth, Ptahil first creates Adam and then, \"according to the likeness of Adam,\" he creates Eve (in Mandaic, Hawwa, whose heavenly counterpart is Anana dNhura or \"cloud of light\"). Both figures are immobile until Ptahil obtains a spirit (mana) from his father, Abathur, and places it into the couple. After this incarnation, the savior figure Manda dHayye (\"knowledge of life\") comes to Adam and Eve, instruct- ing them in the knowledge (manda, similar to gnosis) of their true home in the world of light and the ritual means of returning there. Mandaeans, whose very name means \"knowers\" or \"gnostics,\" view Adam and Eve as their ancestors in two ways. First, they serve as the archetypal Man- daeans insofar as they are mired in ignorance until a messenger from the world of light reveals their true, divine nature—a more straightforward ver- sion of the gnostic allegory of the pearl in the mud. Second, the Mandaeans consider themselves to be the physical descendents of Adam and Eve. In addition to shedding light on the Mandaeans' self-conception, these an- thropogonic traditions illumine other important aspects of the religion. First, Mandaeans share with other gnostics a complex and ambivalent attitude to- ward the Hebrew Bible. On the one hand, they reject the canonical character of the Bible and substitute their own sacred texts. On the other hand, as in the above example, they liberally incorporate biblical stories into their own mythological narratives. In many cases, Mandaeans employ what scholars of gnosticism have called inverse exegesis, namely, offering interpretations that directly contradict the standard Jewish or Christian interpretations of the same biblical texts. Second, these anthropogonic myths reveal the Mandaean affinity for what may be called \"doubling\": the view that heavenly beings and realities have counterparts in the physical world. Hence both Adam and Eve are images of heavenly prototypes. Related to this tendency is the Mandaean belief that Adam's body is a microcosm of the universe. Finally, the Mandaean version of the primal or cosmic Adam myth also hints at the great importance of rituals in returning the exiled soul to the world of light. Like Adam and Eve, the Man- daeans' own salvation depends not only on revelations from heavenly light messengers such as Manda dHayye but also on their own correct performance of rituals, most notably baptism (masbuta) in living waters (mia hiyya). Another important set of Mandaean myths reflects the highly ambivalent relationship of Mandaeism to Judaism. In oral traditions, the Mandaeans imply that they were present in Egypt with the Israelites and at the biblical"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"MANDAEAN LITERATURE 529 Exodus. The Mandaeans identify with the Egyptians, however, instead of the Israelites. Indeed, there is an annual ritual meal dedicated to the Egyptians who perished in the Sea of Reeds while pursuing the Israelites. The Man- daeans claim that Moses (whom they call Musa) quarreled with their ances- tors in Egypt. Instead of serving the true god, Moses worshiped the evil deity Adonai (that is, the biblical god, whom the Mandaeans also identify with the sun). Although these stories suggest a desire to differentiate the Mandaeans from the biblical Israelites, they also reveal a kind of kinship, at least in terms of historical consciousness. Equally provocative is a text that depicts Judaism as a stage that must be \"cast off\" before becoming Mandaean. The same text, known as the Scroll of Exalted Kingship, connects the Mandaic term for Jew- ish people, or iahutaiia, with another word meaning \"abortion\" or \"miscar- riage,\" a midrashic type of pun that implies that Judaism is an incompletely developed religion in comparison with Mandaeism. The most explicitly historical account of the group's origins, a document called the Haran gawaita, also suggests a link to Judaism. According to the Haran gawaita, a community of Mandaeans once lived in Jerusalem, where they were persecuted by the Jewish people. In response to this pressure, the text claims, the Mandaeans emigrated to the east, eventually settling in pres- ent day Iran and Iraq. Elements of the text, including a reference to a certain king Ardban (perhaps the Parthian ruler Artaban III, IV, or V), indicate a first or second century CE date for the events described. Finally, another story that takes place in Jerusalem tells of a Jewish girl named Miriai, who converted to Mandaeism after receiving a revelation from the savior figure Anosh. Miriai became the ancestor of 365 disciples, whose death at the hands of the Jewish people incited Anosh to destroy the city of Jerusalem and slay the Jewish community. These and other complex stories allude to an intimate if highly ambivalent relationship between Mandaeism and Judaism. This relationship is also at- tested to by a host of similar (and in some cases identical) beliefs in angels, a number of striking and important parallels between Mandaeism and Jewish mysticism, and a shared history in Babylonia, where the two communities spoke similar dialects of Aramaic and had extensive contact over the centuries. A different theory of origins was offered by the Portuguese Christians w ho came into contact with the Mandaeans in the sixteenth century. Al- though they were not the first European Christians to encounter the Man- daeans (an Italian Dominican monk reported a meeting in 1290), the"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"530 MANDAEAN LITERATURE Portuguese were the first to establish an extensive and lengthy relationship. Based on the Mandaeans' baptismal practices and their veneration of John the baptizer, the Portuguese decided that the Mandaeans were a long lost Christian group. During the same period, the Portuguese came into contact with Indian Christians in Goa who traced their origins to Saint Thomas. Ini- tially, the Portuguese linked the Mandaeans to the missionary efforts of John the evangelist in Mesopotamia. Later, however, they speculated that the Man- daeans were founded by John the baptizer in the area of the Jordan River be- fore migrating to the east. For centuries thereafter, the Mandaeans were known in Europe as the \"Christians of Saint John\" {Christiani di San Giovanni). Yet while the Mandaeans themselves venerated John the baptizer, they never depict him as their founder. Moreover, Mandaean texts condemn Jesus as a \"false messiah\" and a \"liar\" who perverted John the baptizer's teachings. Their extremely negative attitude to Jesus contrasts sharply with his positive image in many western gnostic texts and in Manichaeism, where Jesus is viewed as one of the revealer figures. Mandaean literature also polemicizes against Christian practices, most notably celibacy of the clergy, which Man- daeans view as an abomination. Thus the identification of the Mandaeans as a Christian sect must ultimately be rejected, even though the two religions share a number of significant parallels; for example, they both treat Sunday (in Mandaic, habshaba) as the sabbath. Since the nineteenth century, Western scholars have taken up the question of Mandaean origins. While some have placed the group's roots in the early Islamic period, many more have speculated that the Mandaeans are pre- Christian and may have even influenced canonical Christian texts such as the Gospel of John. Other scholars have argued that the Mandaeans originated as a sectarian Jewish or Jewish-Christian group in Palestine, emerging in the fertile religious milieu that produced the Dead Sea Scrolls as well as a host of baptismal groups. Still others have argued that a non-Jewish western gnostic group may have migrated to Mesopotamia, where its members adopted and transformed indigenous religious traditions. Earlier speculation that Mandaeism developed out of Manichaeism has been definitively refuted by the Coptic Manichaean songs (or psalms) of Thomas, discovered in Egypt and dated to the fourth century CE (see \"The Coptic Manichaean Songbook\" in Part Five). The songs of Thomas are close adaptations of Mandaean liturgical texts and suggest that Thomas (a student of Mani) was influenced by older Mandaean traditions while living in Mesopotamia, before Mani sent him to Egypt to preach. At the same time, the"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"MANDAEAN LITERATURE 531 hypothesis that Mani was born into a Mandaean community has also been re- futed, in this case, by the Cologne Mani Codex, which indicates that Mani was raised among the Jewish-Christian sect of the Elkesaites (see the introduction to Part Five). In dating the origins and development of Mandaeism, scholars have em- ployed a number of approaches. Although the earliest extant manuscripts are late (from about the sixteenth century), bowls and lead amulets used for magic are much earlier, with one such amulet dated to the second or third century CE. Comparisons of the Mandaic alphabet with other scripts, such as Nabataean and Elymaean, have also shed light on where and when the group developed. Another criterion for dating is the presence of Arabic terms in Mandaean texts (for example, the name Allah for the highest god), thereby suggesting a post-Islamic context for particular textual recensions. Recently, attention has been focused on the colophons appended to practically all of the Mandaean scrolls. These colophons contain scribal genealogies, in some cases dating back for centuries, as well as historically valuable information on geog- raphy, politics, and relations within the community. The oldest of these ge- nealogies may date back to 270 CE, making it one of the earliest extant sources on the Mandaeans. MYTHOLOGY Mandaeism possesses an incredibly rich mythology, which—to borrow a gnostic phrase—provides knowledge of \"whence we have come and whither we are going.\" Perhaps even more than their gnostic relatives, the Mandaeans employ myth as the chief vehicle for articulating and transmitting their worldview and ritual practices. Therefore, in order to understand Mandaean theology, cosmology, anthropology, and ritual we must turn to myths. Like the rabbinic midrash they frequently resemble, these are typically nonsystematic in their presentation. While this does not diminish the myths' profundity or cultural significance, it nevertheless presents an interpretive challenge to the uninitiated. Additional features of many Mandaean mythological texts are the highly original geometrical illustrations that accompany them. Mandaean mythology evinces a dualistic worldview in which the world of light (alma dnhura) opposes the world of darkness (alma dshuka) from the beginning. As in other gnostic mythologies, a theogonic process of emanation precedes a cosmogonic fall or rupture. The first god, known by a number of names including the \"great life\" (hiia raba) and \"lord of greatness\" (mara"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"532 MANDAEAN LITERATURE drabuta), emanates the second life, third life, and fourth life, who are also known by the names Yoshamin, Abathur, and Ptahil, respectively. Along with a host of lesser light beings, they occupy a realm (frequently called the \"house of life\") of heavenly waters or \"Jordans.\" The light beings {'utria or uthras) who inhabit this realm of fullness are depicted as celestial priests whose ritu- als serve as the model for those performed by the Mandaean priests in the earthly \"Jordans\" of Mesopotamia. Opposing this realm of light and water is the world of darkness, which originally consists of the \"black waters.\" According to one tradition, the \"king of darkness\" (malka dhshuka) emerges from the waters in an act of self- production and then proceeds to create a host of demons, liliths, vampires, and other beasts. He himself is an androgyne with the head of a lion, the body of a dragon, the wings of an eagle, the back of a tortoise, and the hands and feet of a monster, a description that recalls some of the archons in the Secret Book of John. In a different Mandaean tradition, which parallels the gnostic Sophia myth, a female figure named Ruha initially dwells in the world of light, until she \"falls\" and gives birth to the lord of darkness (also known as Ur, a dragon). Together they create a host of evil beings, including the seven plan- ets and the twelve signs of the zodiac. Although Mandaeans condemn the powers of the zodiac, they also employ elements of Babylonian astrological magic in certain texts (for example, Sfar malwashia) and rites. As in Judaism, therefore, official condemnation of magic exists side by side with the prolif- eration of magical texts, amulets, and practices. The creation of the physical world (tibil) also echoes the Sophia myth. In this case, however, a male figure (the third life, also called Abathur and Bhaq Ziwa) gazes into the black waters and declares, \"I shall call forth a world.\" He then orders the demiurge Ptahil, called Gabriel in some sources, to create the world. After fashioning the earth with the help of the evil powers, Ptahil cre- ates the bodies of Adam and Eve, a process discussed above. As punishment for the creation of the world, both Ptahil and Abathur are exiled from the world of light. Ptahil is put in stocks and Abathur is enthroned at the entrance of the world of light, where he weighs the souls and decides which ones are worthy to enter. Complicating this picture is the fact that each of the fallen light beings, as well as the earth itself, possesses an ideal image or dmuta in the world of light. This fascinating and sophisticated ontological category prevents Mandaean dualism from becoming a static system of polar opposites. Instead, figures"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"MANDAEAN LITERATURE 533 such as Abathur and Ruha continue to have a mirror image in the world of light, even after they have fallen from grace. Because of this dual quality, they are able to function as mediators and, as we will see shortly, always possess the potential for redemption. Much of Mandaean literature is devoted to the ongoing struggle between the forces of light and darkness. These mytho-historical narratives fre- quently incorporate stories from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. More often than not, however, biblical episodes are turned on their head (thus Moses is a prophet of the evil god Adonai; Jesus is a false messiah and liar). Only the Mandaeans know the true nature of the world, and they alone are capable of escaping or, to put it more accurately, returning to the world of light. Mandaean soteriology focuses on individual and collective salvation (in Mandaic, purqana) alike. Every Mandaean possesses a soul (nishimta or mana) from the world of light, as well as a spirit {ruha). At the time of death, the soul ascends through seven or eight \"watchhouses\" (mattarta) until it ar- rives at the throne of Abathur, who weighs the soul in his scales. If found wor- thy, the soul is joined with the spirit and helped across the celestial waters (hafiqia mia) by a messenger of light, and is thus returned to the house of life, where it receives a garment and a wreath. If found unworthy, the soul is rele- gated to a watchhouse or purgatory appropriate to its sin. For example, Jesus the \"magician\" occupies a watchhouse with other men and women who prac- ticed celibacy, while a different watchhouse contains individuals who fasted and practiced self-mortification. On the final \"day of judgment\" (yoma rba ddina), the imprisoned souls will be cast into the fiery \"sea of the end\" {yama dsuf). Meanwhile, the fallen light beings, including Yoshamin, Abathur, Ptahil, and the female figure Ruha (like her counterpart, the spirit, ruha), will be rehabilitated and reintegrated into the world of light. RITUAL AND ETHICS Although there are many Mandaean rituals, the two most important are bap- tism (masbuta) and the mass for the dead (masiqta), of which several types exist. Baptism occurs every Sunday and can be performed only in an earthly Jordan or \"living water\" (a river, stream, or pool that contains flowing .water). It represents a reenactment of Adam's baptism at the hands of the heavenly figure Hibil (Abel) and mirrors the baptisms performed by the celestial priests in the world of light. The ritual involves multiple immersions, blessings, and"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"534 MANDAEAN LITERATURE liturgical recitations, concluding with a handclasp (kushta) between the layperson and the priest. Preparations for the masiqta, as well as the rite itself, are highly complex and cannot be described in detail here. The ceremony occurs in a cult hut (mandi) built near a river or stream. Important elements include the priestly recitation of hymns, the sacrifice of a dove (which sym- bolizes the spirit), and the ritual preparation of small unleavened loaves called fatiria, as well as other foodstuffs. The purpose of the masiqta is to unite soul and spirit and help them enter the world of light. There are three classes of Mandaean priests, the tarmide (\"disciples\" or \"students\"), the more lofty ganzibre (\"treasurers\"), and the rish ama (\"head of the people\"). Members of the priesthood are called Nasoreans, a name that once applied to all Mandaeans. Priests wear white garments mirroring those worn by beings in the world of light. Today all priests are male, but there is evidence of female priests in the past. Mandaean priests must be physically and ritually pure. They cannot be eunuchs or circumcised, must be married, and must avoid pollution through contact with improperly slaughtered meat, stagnant water, or menstruating women. The Mandaean valorization of mar- riage and procreation contrasts sharply with certain western gnostic sources, which portray sexual intercourse as a curse of the demiurge. In Mandaean mythology, sexual desire and pregnancy are given to humankind by the savior figure Hibil (Abel). While priests are held to a higher standard of ritual purity, all Mandaeans are expected to adhere to a rigorous ethical standard, which en- courages the giving of alms (zidqa) and condemns the use of weapons. RECENT HISTORY AND TODAY In the aftermath of the Muslim conquest, Mandaeans were identified with the Sabians, a \"people of the book\" {'ahl al-kitab) mentioned three times in the Qur'an. Beginning in the ninth century, however, a pagan group in Mesopotamia known as the Harranians adopted the title Sabians in an effort to gain protection under Islamic law. From this point on, Muslim authorities frequently conflated the Mandaeans with the \"Sabians of Harran\" and con- demned them as star worshipers. Over the centuries this identification has led to periodic persecutions of the Mandaeans. In response, the Mandaeans have vehemently denied the charges of idolatry and defended their status as a protected people. At present, the status of the Mandaeans in Iraq and Iran is not entirely clear. The long conflict between the two countries, the Gulf War, the Iraq War"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"MANDAEAN LITERATURE 535 of 2003, and other tumultuous events in the region have had a major impact on the environment and peoples of southern Iraq and Iran, including the Mandaeans. At a recent gathering of Mandaeans and scholars at Harvard University, leaders of the Mandaean community in Iran estimated the popu- lation of Mandaeans in Iraq as seventy-five thousand and in Iran as thirty- five thousand. The Mandaeans of Iran maintain schools where children learn Mandaic, and the number of Mandaic speakers appears to be greater there than in Iraq, although any precise comparison is currently impossible. Turmoil in the Persian Gulf region has created a growing Mandaean dias- pora. According to recent statistics, there are approximately seventy Man- daean families in the New York City area, including New Jersey, and others in Florida, Michigan, and California. There is also a large community of Man- daeans in Australia, while smaller groups and individuals may be found in Glasgow, Scotland; Odessa, Ukraine; and other cities. Increasingly, Man- daeans encounter the challenges of assimilation, modern technology, and a radically different physical environment. Mandaeans around the world maintain contact with one another and with their home communities in the Middle East. They are led by a priesthood still recovering from a devastating cholera epidemic in 1831, which killed all of the adult priests but spared a handful of their sons. In recent years, priests from Iran have traveled to Australia and the United States to perform baptisms, weddings, and other rituals. As the Mandaeans enter the twenty-first century, they face the future strengthened by a long history of tenacious survival and cultural creativity."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"35 The Ginza 1 he most significant holy book of the Mandaeans is the Ginza. The • Ginza, whose title means \"treasure,\" is also known as the \"great JL. book.\" It is divided into two parts, the right Ginza and the left Ginza, the former containing mythological and theological materials, the lat- ter songs for the rituals for the dead. In the selections from the Ginza presented here, the Mandaean vision of the world of light and the world of darkness is portrayed with beautiful and powerful images.

The scene is established in the opening words, \"I am happy, very happy, though I am hurt in the house of the wicked.\" In his plaintive discourse, Hibil emphasizes the gnostic struggle of light over darkness and asks how many adulterers and thieves—as well as those poor beings who live in darkness and temptation and fail to find the way to knowledge and light—he will have to send into darkness. He tells us that he made darkness and light, and that he chose Abathur as the high judge to stand at the dread toll stations where he determines what souls are worthy to enter the house of light.

Rather than harm, he would save. \"When will they give up killing?\" he asks. \"When will combat fade, and my heart heal?\" By the tract's end, Hibil is pleased with his report to Manda dHayye, and his speech rises in poetic transport before those virtuous humans to whom he offers ascension to and communion with the father of light.

Previously considered by Western scholars to be a Christian heresy, Manichaeism is now properly understood in the context of third-century Mesopotamian religions. The religion was founded by the Iranian prophet Mani (216-77 CE), who deliberately created a universal and propagandistic religion that incorporated Christian, Zoroastrian, and Buddhist concepts. Whether Manichaeism is properly designated as gnostic, as Hans Jonas and others have suggested, is being debated by scholars. The religion moved east toward India and west into the Roman Empire already in Mani's lifetime, reaching as far west as Algiers and southern Europe and as far east as Central Asia and southeast coastal China, where traces of the religion datable to the early seventeenth century can be identified. The focus of this introduction is on western Manichaeism. LIFE OF MANI Mani was born on April 14, 216, near the Mesopotamian city of Ctesiphon, Parthia. His parents were of Iranian descent. His mother, Maryam, was re- lated to the ruling Arsacid dynasty, and his father, Patik, was a devotee in an Elkesaite Mughtasilist community, a Jewish-Christian baptismal sect with gnostic and ascetic features that derived from the popular religious move- ment founded by the obscure figure Elkesai. Mani entered the baptismal group at the age of four, but the most striking incident of his early life was a revelation he received at the age of twelve, when an angel he called \"the twin\" appeared and ordered him to leave the baptismal group at an unspecified later date. The crucial second revelation came at the age of twenty-four, when"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"570 MANICHAEAN LITERATURE the angel ordered him to begin his public ministry by openly preaching the newly revealed doctrine. This novel public teaching put Mani at odds with the traditional community, and he was forced to leave with only the support of his father and two faithful followers. Although Mani's new doctrine con- tained many elements that were rejected by the baptismal community, the primary point of contention was probably his argument that ritual purity through baptism was of no avail and that true redemptive purity comes only from the physical and moral separation of light from darkness, spirit from matter, and good from evil. Mani proclaimed himself the messenger (or apostle) of light, the com- forter (or paraclete) incarnate (see John 14:16,26), and the seal of the prophets who would bring the final revelation to the world. Mani viewed all previous re- ligious traditions as contaminated versions of the originally true though in- complete teachings of the prophets Buddha, Jesus, and Zoroaster. Mani, as the seal of the prophets, proclaimed the final revelation, the true universal religion that would unite all people through his teaching. This grand plan required propagandistic methods designed to overcome the cultural and linguistic bar- riers that prevented the revelations of the earlier prophets from reaching a uni- versal audience. Mani emphasized the need for the translation of Manichaean texts into all languages in order to propagate his teaching as effectively and quickly as possible. In contrast to the earlier prophets, whose teachings were put into written form by their followers, who contaminated those teachings with their own interpretations, Mani himself produced a corpus of seven canonical works. Perhaps Mani's most effective propaganda tool was his abil- ity to instill in his followers a sense of the absolute necessity to devote their lives to propagating the religion. Mani himself traveled extensively during his own lifetime and was influenced by the popular image of the Christian mes- senger Thomas, who, tradition holds, traveled as far as India to spread the Christian faith. Mani's canon of seven works, written in the eastern Aramaic language, consists of the Living Gospel, the Treasure of Life, the Pragmateia, the Book of Mysteries, the Book of the Giants, the Letters, and the Psalms and Prayers. Mani also wrote the Shaburagan, which replaces the Psalms and Prayers in some canonical lists. None of these texts is known to survive today in a com- plete form. Much previous research in Manichaeism has depended on a con- siderable number of quotes and descriptions in the writings of heresiologists and historians. The most important works were the Acta archelai, the writings"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"MANICHAEAN LITERATURE 571 of the former Manichaean Augustine of Hippo, and the works of the Arab au- thors al-Biruni and Ibn al-Nadim. Mani's first mission was eastward, like that of Thomas before him, and he met an early success in what is now southeast Iran with the conversion of Turan-shah, the Buddhist king of Turan, and his entourage. He continued to meet success during his return journey through Persia, Susiana, and Mesene. Mani returned to the Persian Sassanid empire when the emperor Ardashir I died and his son Shapur I assumed the throne. He met with Sha- pur and was granted the freedom and protection to propagate the religion throughout the empire. Manichaeism was adopted by the emperor's family and influential political figures. During this period of imperial favor, Mani wrote the Shaburagan, a summary of his teachings in the Middle Persian lan- guage, and dedicated it to Shapur. Manichaeism then spread throughout Per- sia, beyond its borders, and even westward into the Roman Empire. Mani accompanied Shapur in the victorious Persian campaign against the Roman forces in which the Roman emperor Valerian was captured at Edessa in 260. Although Mani enjoyed imperial favor under Shapur, the Magian clergy of the official state religion, Zoroastrianism, grew intent on persecuting the prophet. When Shapur I died, his successors Hormizd and Bahram I both favored the traditional state religion. The Zoroastrian high priest Kerder (or Karder), now strengthened by widespread nationalistic aspirations, was successful in con- vincing Bahram to begin official persecution of the minority movement. By order of the emperor, Mani was arrested, brought to Gundeshahbur (Susiana), interrogated for one month under Kerder, and died in prison. MANICHAEAN SACRED TEXTS The success of the intense heresiological polemic against Manichaeism re- sulted in the effective censorship and eventual elimination of Manichaean texts from the western and eastern manuscript traditions. Heretics of all types throughout the medieval period were uncritically slandered as Manichaeans. Even Luther's Catholic detractors spoke of a revived Manichaeism. The Protes- tant response demanded a more objective understanding of Manichaeism, in- vestigated known Manichaean evidences, and so initiated the modern study of the religion. From the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries, the works of Christian and pagan heresiologists were studied in depth, resulting in the interpretation"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"572 MANICHAEAN LITERATURE of Manichaeism as primarily a Christian heresy, rather than as an independ- ent religion in its own right. This interpretation was proposed in the eigh- teenth century by the Calvinist theologian Isaac de Beausobre, who argued that Mani was a brilliant precursor of Luther and thus part of the history of reformed Christianity. Although this position was ultimately rejected, the great contribution of Beausobre's study was that it drew attention to the pre- viously ignored eastern sources. About a hundred years later, Ferdinand Christian Baur emphasized the significance of the Buddhist, Indo-Iranian, and Zoroastrian elements in Manichaeism, thus bringing the study of Manichaeism into its natural interpretive context: that of the history of East- ern religions. Thereafter scholars began to recognize the significance of the newly discovered and less biased Arab authors, such as the historian Ibn al- Nadim, for a more objective understanding of Manichaeism. It was argued that Mani's eclectic Eastern religion was primarily based on Zoroastrianism and Mughtasilism, which Mani then creatively reinterpreted, using biblical models. Another study pushed Manichaean origins even further back in time to the pre-Zoroastrian beliefs of Babylonian religion. This study argued that Mani was concerned with recovering the original sources of Zoroaster's beliefs in an attempt to undercut his Magian opponents in the Sassanid court. To these ancient Babylonian beliefs it was suggested that Mani added elements from Buddhism, Christianity, and Mithraism. During the twentieth century several great discoveries of Manichaean sa- cred texts have revolutionized our knowledge of Manichaeism. Those texts form three groups: Central Asian and Chinese sources, writings in Greek and Latin, and Coptic scriptures. Central Asian and Chinese Texts Between 1904 and 1914, German archeological teams were engaged in four expeditions of ruined Manichaean monasteries at Turfan and Qoco in Sinkiang, China, north of Tibet. The teams recovered thousands of frag- ments from heavily damaged Manichaean manuscripts. These Turfan frag- ments (many of which could not be conserved) are the disintegrated remains of what were once high-quality illuminated manuscripts that had suffered mutilation under Muslim conquerors. The texts are written in several Cen- tral Asian languages, and they are now conserved in the collection of the Ger- man Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Sir Aurel Stein discovered the remains of a large hoard of Buddhist and Manichaean manuscripts in the Temple of the"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"MANICHAEAN LITERATURE 573 Thousand Buddhas at Tun-huang (east-southeast of Turfan). Stein recovered a long Manichaean confessional text entitled Confessional for the Hearers. Also discovered were three Manichaean texts translated into Chinese from Iranian-language originals, including the Treatise on Cosmogony and Its Im- plications for the Everyday Life of Manichaeans (now conserved in Beijing), the Hymn Scroll (now in London), and the Compendium of the Teaching of Mani, the Buddha of Light (now in London and Paris). Western scholars are now informed of the numerous recent discoveries of Manichaean archaeological sites, artifacts, and texts in Central Asia and China through the works of S. N. C. Lieu and Geng Shimin. As an example of a most recent discovery of a Manichaean text in Chinese, Lin Wu-shu of Sun Yat Sen University (Guangzhou, China) published a fragmentary Manichaean in- scription that was found in Fukien Province. The inscription on the large stele dates from 1315 to 1369, originally consisted of sixteen calligraphic Chinese characters, and is similar to another Manichaean inscription in Chinese in the famous Manichaean temple in Ch'iian-chou, also in Fukien Province. That temple, discovered in the 1950s, is today the only known intact Manichaean temple site and contains an intact low-relief statue of \"Mani the Buddha of Light.\" Near the temple were found inscribed (ritual?) bowls and three Manichaean tombstones. Greek and Latin Texts Sensational discoveries of Manichaean manuscripts have also been made in the West. Albert Henrichs and Ludwig Koenen announced in 1970 the suc- cessful decipherment of a small parchment codex acquired by the University of Cologne. The Cologne Mani Codex dates from the end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century, or possibly later, and contains a Greek transla- tion of a previously unknown Manichaean text originally written in Syriac, with the title On the Origin of His Body. The text seems to be an anthology containing quotations from the works of several of Mani's early disciples ed- ited by a final redactor around a core of Mani's own autobiographical state- ments. The traditions contained in the Cologne Mani Codex concern Mani's latter days with the baptismal sect and his early missionary journeys after the age of twenty-four, and thus they constitute some of the most important sources of information on Mani's early life. A fragmentary Manichaean parchment codex, the Tebessa Codex, was discovered in a cave near Theveste, Algeria, in 1918 and placed in the National"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"574 MANICHAEAN LITERATURE Library of Paris. Only twenty-five damaged leaves and the slight remains of four others are preserved from this codex, with each page originally carrying two columns of Latin text. The extant text contains two sections: an apolo- getic discussion on the relationship between the two major groups in the Manichaean church, the elect and the auditors, with allusions to and quota- tions of relevant canonical gospel texts; and a discussion in which the un- known Manichaean author defends the \"nonwork ethic\" of the Manichaean elect (who had their practical needs met by the auditors), apparently as an apologetic response to Christian charges that the messenger Paul had clearly condemned such dependent lifestyles in 2 Thessalonians 3:10b (\"If anyone will not work, let that person not eat\"). The Manichaean apologist begins with the Pauline text and then continues to defend the dependent lifestyles of the Manichaean elect, quoting or alluding to nearly every letter in the Pauline (and deutero-Pauline) canonical corpus. Coptic Texts Seven papyrus codices with Manichaean texts in the Coptic language were discovered by local workers digging through the ruins of an ancient house in the Fayyum town of Medinet Madi probably sometime in 1929. These books were all purchased in the next three years through a series of acquisitions by Sir Chester Beatty, an American businessman and art collector residing in England (two codices and parts of two others are now the property of the Chester Beatty Library, Dublin), and by the noted German papyrologist Carl Schmidt of Berlin (three codices and parts of two others are now the prop- erty of the State Museums of Berlin). A few leaves are in the national collec- tions of Vienna and Warsaw. The seven books include a book of Psalms; a heavily damaged book of homiletical material (Greek, synaxeis), which may reflect or even be identified as the lost Living Gospel of Mani; two books of central principles (Greek, kephalaia); a book of Homilies; a book of Acts; and a book of Letters. Some of these Manichaean texts have been published, some still await publication, and some have been lost, owing to the confusion in Europe after World War II. Manichaean literary and documentary texts dating to the fourth century have recently been discovered in the ancient town of Kellis in the Dakhleh Oasis of Egypt's western desert. Texts include Manichaean liturgies, doctrinal works, psalms, biblical texts, Syriac-Greek glossaries, and numerous private letters providing rare insights into Manichaean personal lifestyles.

MANICHAEAN TEACHINGS Mani's teaching embraced a highly complex historical drama of supracosmic proportions in which humanity's past origin, present predicament, and future possibilities are described. The drama centers its theological concern on the existential question of the origin of evil in human experience. Mani employed a typical apocalyptic scheme in which cosmic history was divided into three time periods: past, present, and future. In the past time there existed two eternal principles, one all good and the other all evil. The good principle exists exclusively within the kingdom of light and finds its focus in the father of greatness, whose fourfold majesty embraces divinity, light, power, and goodness. His throne is surrounded by at least 156 peace-loving entities: twelve aeons (or eternal realms, in three groups of four each) and 144 aeons of aeons. The kingdom of light is constructed of five ele- ments or stoicheia (air, wind, light, water, and fire) and contains five peaceful \"dwellings\" (intelligence, knowledge, reason, thought, and deliberation). (In Manichaeism many things are given in five, even the five trees of paradise rem- iniscent of Gospel of Thomas 19.) The evil principle and the kingdom of dark- ness are the complete antitheses of the good principle and the kingdom of light. The many monstrous and agitated inhabitants of the kingdom of dark- ness are ruled by five evil archons (demon, lion, eagle, fish, and dragon), who are in constant opposition to each other and who, collectively, make up the hellish prince of darkness. They are sexually preoccupied and controlled by their passions, and they dwell in an ominous netherworld of smoke, fire, wind, water, and darkness. The two kingdoms are completely distinct yet eter- nally coexistent. The \"present time\" begins when the evil inhabitants of the kingdom of darkness drive a wedge into the kingdom of light in a lustful desire to mingle with the light. The kingdom of darkness is thoroughly aroused, and its terri- fyingly vicious inhabitants enter the light in a full-scale invasion. The father of greatness responds by evoking a series of entities who may need to be sacri- ficed to the invaders so as to satisfy them and stop the assault. The first evoca- tion is the mother of life, who then evokes the primal man, who fights the incoming forces of darkness but loses his battle. The five evil archons (who constitute the prince of darkness) then consume some of the light elements of"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"57 6 MANICHAEAN LITERATURE the primal man's armor. Having unwittingly fallen into the trap of the father of greatness, they are now dependent on the light for their continued exis- tence. The primal man awakens from his sleep of forgetfulness, remembers his divine origins, and prays for his rescue. The father of greatness responds by evoking a series of beings who initiate the rescue of the primal man: the friend of lights evokes the great architect, who then evokes the living spirit, who evokes his five sons (the custodian of splendor, the great king of honor, Adamas of light, the king of glory, and Atlas). The living spirit cries out from the kingdom of light into the darkness to the primal man, who answers. The cry and answer (representing the divine word of salvation and the positive human response) are hypostasized, that is, they become divine beings who as- cend to the kingdom of light. The living spirit then grasps the primal man by the hand and rescues him from the kingdom of darkness. The rest of the drama in the \"present time\" focuses on the work of the fa- ther of greatness to regain all of the light particles swallowed by the five evil ar- chons. The living spirit first creates ten heavens and eight earths out of the material corpses of the slain demons. He separates the swallowed light parti- cles into three types: the first is undefiled, and from these he creates the sun and the moon; the second is only partly defiled, and from these he creates the stars; the third is completely defiled, and so he creates an elaborate cosmic mechanism to distill the light from the matter. The living spirit then evokes the third messenger, who evokes the zodiacal twelve maidens, collectively the maiden of light, who operate the cosmic three wheels created to distill the light particles out of the material universe. Another evocation is the column of glory (the Milky Way), which transports the recovered light particles from the distilling three wheels to the moon and then the sun, which function as ships transporting the light particles to their temporary haven (the new earth cre- ated by the great architect). The third messenger and the maiden of light then excite the sexual nature of the male archons, causing them to ejaculate the light particles from within them. The sin that excites the archons falls to the earth, becoming the source of all plant life. The female archons miscarry their light-bearing fetuses, which fall to the earth and copulate among themselves, becoming the source of all animal life. The sum total of all of these precious light particles trapped in deadly matter, including plants and animals, is called the suffering Jesus (Jesus patibilis), who is on the light cross (crux luminus). The prince of darkness, in an attempt to frustrate the cosmic distillation of light particles, gives birth to the two evil demons, Sakla (Ashqulan) and Ne- broel (Namrael), who eat the monstrous offspring of the miscarried fetuses"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"MANICHAEAN LITERATURE 577 in order to ingest their light particles. The two demons then copulate, and Nebroel gives birth to exact miniature replicas (the \"image of God\" of Gene- sis 1:26-27) of the confused light-matter macrocosm: Adam and Eve. In a typically gnostic \"inverted exegesis\" of Genesis 1-5 (a hermeneutical feature shared with some forms of gnosticism), the sexually oriented evil creator can create only by copulation and birth, and so can create only matter (which is inherently evil). He is unable to create in the manner of the father of great- ness, by asexually evoking pure spiritual entities. Consequently, Adam (repre- senting humanity) is specifically designed by the evil creator in his own image (Genesis 1:26) to procreate sexually (Genesis 1:27-28). Thus, Adam can only continue the evil cycle of birth, copulation, and rebirth, and in so doing he fulfills his natural evil inclination to \"be fruitful and multiply\" (Genesis 1:28; 5:4b). Adam's evil material nature (representing human sexu- ality) thus entangles the precious light particles, transmitted through male seed, in potentially endless generations of material bodies (representing human history; see Genesis 5:1-32). But Adam is ignorant of the light within him and his true origin in the kingdom of light and so is unable to recognize and redeem the light particles. The evocations of the father of greatness then send Jesus of light to awaken Adam (Genesis 3:1) to inform him of his true nature (Genesis 3:4-5) and to lead him to self-recognition (Genesis 3:7,11a, 22a). Jesus of light helps Adam eat of the salvific tree of life (Genesis 3:22), warns him of the dangers of sex- ual procreation with Eve, and so encourages a sexually abstinent lifestyle (the ideal model of behavior in Manichaean ethics). Then Eve and a male archon copulate, and Eve gives birth to Cain (Genesis 4:1), who then copulates with his mother Eve, who gives birth to Abel (Genesis 4:2), and so begins the in- cestuous interaction of Cain (Genesis 4:2a) and Abel with Eve and with each other's daughters borne by Eve (Genesis 4:17). Eve then receives magical knowledge from an evil archon, which enables her to copulate with the asce- tic Adam. She succeeds in her desire and bears Seth (Genesis 4:25a), who, as the first true son of Adam (Genesis 5:3, 4b), contains a significantly larger amount of light particles than the other offspring of Eve. The ascetic Adam and Seth, self-conscious particles of light entrapped in innately evil material bodies, become the exemplary human figures for Manichaean ethics (Genesis 4:26b; 5:1-32). The \"future time\" is the third and final act of the historical cosmic drama, and it provides for Manichaean ethics a preview into the system of reward and punishment. The final and great war will break out among the"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"5/8 MANICHAEAN LITERATURE unenlightened powers of darkness when the distillation of light particles from the material cosmos has neared its completion. Jesus will return at a decisive eschatological moment as the great king and will judge humanity and the infernal powers. The elect will become angels, the auditors will be judged righteous, and the sinners will be cast into hell with the sexually promiscuous woman Eve and her hellish offspring. The cosmos will disinte- grate and burn in a conflagration for 1,468 years. The remaining light parti- cles will be gathered and finally return by ascent to the kingdom of light, while the prince of darkness and his diabolical minions will be cast into a bottomless pit permanently sealed with a huge stone for all eternity. The two principles of light and darkness will again be two separate and distinct enti- ties, never again to commingle. THE MANICHAEAN CHURCH Just as Jesus of light was the prime evocation of liberation for Adam, so the great mind (nous) is the prime evocation of Jesus of light for the liberation of Adam's descendants throughout human history, thus providing the unique Manichaean solution to the human predicament. The primary redemptive function of the great mind is to reveal the true knowledge of the origin and destination of the human soul (self-recognition), and the two central precepts of Manichaean belief: the three periods of cosmic history, and the existence of two eternally antithetic and supracosmic principles. Individual human beings are replicant microcosms of the confused \"light- matter\" macrocosm. As such they endure an eternal struggle within their own souls for release from matter and return to their true home in the immaterial kingdom of light. After the individual human soul has been awakened by the great mind (a typical experience of regeneration), that individual is conscious of the eternal dualistic realities that control its fate, and it then can hope to succeed against influences from the lower nature. This internal struggle was described by Mani in Pauline terms concerning the \"new person\" (1 Corinthi- ans 3:9-10) and the \"old person\" (Ephesians 4:22-24), who are locked in mor- tal combat. The individual can succeed in this struggle through the continued protection of the great mind, which is accessible only in the teaching of Mani and the guidance of the Manichaean church. Strict adherence to the extreme ascetic requirements (sexual abstinence, poverty, vegetarianism) is impossible to enforce on the popular level and, were such strict adherence to succeed, would result in the eventual extinction of the human race. Knowing that such"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"MANICHAEAN LITERATURE  579  commitment could only be expected from himself and a few choice believers, Mani divided his church into two basic classes, the elect and the auditors. The elect are required to keep the \"five commandments\" (to be pure and poor and not to lie, kill, or eat flesh) and to adhere to the \"three seals.\" First, the seal of the mouth (signacula oris) includes the avoidance of evil speech, the drinking of alcohol, and the eating of meat. The vegetarian requirement was imperative for the elect because plants contain more light particles than flesh. The light particles are digested through the bodies of the vegetarian elect, re- leased through their belches into the atmosphere, distilled by the cosmic ma- chine of the three wheels, and finally sent on their homeward journey along the column of glory (Milky Way) to the kingdom of light. For this belief here- siologists ridiculed the Manichaean elect as \"saviors of god\" (salvatores dei). Second, the seal of the hands {signacula manuum) forbids the elect from any activity that might injure material objects containing light particles. Thus killing animals, planting, harvesting, or even walking over the smallest plants could prevent the liberation of the light particles (the divine suffering Jesus). Because the procuring and preparation of vegetable foodstuffs often required the damaging or partial destruction of light-bearing plants, the elect were not permitted to prepare their own meals, and instead were served by the auditors, who were pardoned for the unavoidable destruction of plants. Even bathing with water was not allowed for the elect, since water could be defiled by con- tact with material bodily substances. Third, the seal of the breast {signacula sinus) focused especially on the avoidance of sexual intercourse, since the process of birth, copulation, and rebirth was directly related to Adam's lower material nature and was meant by the evil creator to enslave light particles in material bodies. The \"three seals\" were required for all Manichaean elect, while the auditors were given lesser requirements, allowing them to acquire wealth and to marry and maintain mistresses, but were urged to avoid sexual relations. Only the elect would return to the kingdom of light directly after death, while the auditors could only hope to enter into the bodies of vegeta- bles after death and finally be freed through the digestive systems of later elect. All humans who are not awakened by the great mind will be forever damned into an inescapable cycle of reincarnation in the bodies of animals, culminat- ing in their permanent entrapment in the kingdom of darkness. The leadership of the Manichaean church comprised the elect. Extant Manichaean texts in Latin, Greek, Middle Persian, and Chinese are unani- mous in documenting the four classes within the church hierarchy: the central figurehead or pope (Greek, archegos; Latin, princeps), who is Mani's successor;"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"580 MANICHAEAN LITERATURE the twelve messengers; the seventy-two bishops; and the 360 elders. Only males could be enrolled in these four classes. Apart from this governmental hierarchy is the larger body of the elect and the even larger group of auditors. Modern research on the place and function of women in Manichaeism has only recently begun. The complex mythological structures inherent in Manichaean theology are the result of Mani's own creative genius and his diverse theological sources. This complexity first begs the question as to why Mani, wishing to communicate to the masses, would create such a difficult system reminiscent of the \"fables and endless genealogies\" previously decried by the author of the First Letter to Timothy in the New Testament (1:4). One suggestion concerns point of view. Today we see Mani as a creative theologian, but he saw himself as a receptive vehicle of divine revelation, so that the complexity was not his invention but was given to him by the spirit of revelation, as he was merely the prophet of god. Mani's theological complexity also begs the question as to who could un- derstand the fantastic mythological structures. Did the complexity inadver- tently function to limit the number of converts to Mani's religion? No doubt it did, since the heresiological responses indicate that educated theologians, such as Alexander of Lycopolis, struggled to understand Mani's system. That Mani should summarize his own teachings in the Shaburagan indicates that the complexity of the system was already a problem Mani himself tried to overcome. The problem is further indicated within Manichaean social struc- ture itself and the existence of two classes of Manichaean devotees, the elect and the auditors. This bifurcated structure demonstrates that the ability to live the more difficult life of the elect was coupled with their ability to search the Manichaean scriptures and arrive at a full knowledge of the truth, while the auditors understood less and thus less was required of them. Those who ultimately rejected the teaching were considered to be blind, not simply con- fused by the complexity. The Manichaean texts that follow present these sorts of issues in the life of Mani, Manichaean teachings, and Manichaean mythology and theology. As with many religious texts, these Manichaean texts may outlast the tradi- tional keepers of the word. The glory is that the word may remain for readers to discover."},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"38 On the Origin of His Body Mani Codex, a miniature parchment manuscript written in Greek and dated to the late fourth or early fifth century. The text's chief significance is what it says about the life of Mani, including his time, early in his life, among the Jewish-Christian Elkesaites. The Elkesaites, named after their legendary prophet and founder Elkesai (or Elchasai; his name is said to designate the \"hidden power of god\"), constituted a baptizing religion with Jewish and Christian affinities. Like Jews for Jesus or Messianic Jews of the present day, the Elkesaites and other Jewish Christians tried to practice both Jewish and Christian piety, thereby seeking to avoid having to choose one and reject the other. Christian Jewish observance was—and is to the present day—a creative piety, but one that is hard to maintain in the face of religious, social, and political pressures. Mani's father belonged to an Elke- saite community, and Mani himself was initiated into this baptizing group when he was four years old. The Mandaeans are also a part of this Middle Eastern world of baptizing religions. On the Origin of His Body may be so named because of its concern for the life and body of Mani, or it may be given its title in reference to the Manichaean church (according to the apostle Paul the church is the body of Christ).

ON THE ORIGIN OF HIS BODY 1 SECRETS WERE REVEALED TO MANI Also in this way, it is fitting for the all-praiseworthy messenger 2 Mani, through whom and from whom has come to us the hope and inheritance of life, to write to us and to provide interpretation for all posterity, the householders of faith, and those who are spiritual offspring, increasing through his most limpid waters, so that his rapture and revelation may be known to them. For we know, brothers, with this arrival of the comforter 3 of truth, how great the magnitude of his wisdom is in relationship to us. We acknowledge that he has received it neither from people, nor from the reading of books, just as our fa- ther Mani himself says in the letter that he sent to Edessa. For he says thus: \"The truth and the secrets that I speak about—and the laying on of hands that is mine—not from people have I received it nor from fleshly creatures, not even from studies in the scriptures.

All things that are and will be subsist through his power. For from this very one I was conceived, and I am from his will. From him all that is true was revealed to me, and I am from his truth. The truth of ages that he revealed I have seen, and that truth I have disclosed to my fellow travelers; peace I have announced to the children of peace, hope I have proclaimed to the immortal race. The elect 6 1 have chosen, and a path to the height I have shown to those who ascend according to this truth. Hope I have proclaimed, and this revelation I have revealed. This immortal gospel I have written, including in it these eminent mysteries, and disclosing in it the greatest works, the greatest and most august forms of the most eminently powerful works. These things that he revealed I have shown to those who live from the truest vision, which I have seen, and from the most glorious revelation revealed to me.\" Again he said, \"All the secrets that my father has given to me, while I have hidden and covered them from the sects and the pagans, and still more from the world, to you I have revealed according to the pleasure of my most blessed father. And if again he would be pleased, once more I shall reveal them to you. For indeed, the gift that was given to me from the father is very great and rich. For if the whole world and all people obey it, I would be able from this very possession and advantage, which my father has given to me, to enrich them and establish wisdom as sufficient for the entire world.\" 7 4.

Now, when that one came, he preferred and chose me, severed and pulled me out of the midst of those followers of that law in which I was reared.\" Now, very many other extraordinary things like these are in the books of our father, which demonstrate both his revelation and the rapture of his posi- tion as messenger. 10 For very great is the abundance of this coming that, through the comforter, the spirit of truth, is coming to us. Now, concerning these things, why are they sifted thoroughly by us, who are once and for all convinced that this position as messenger excels in its rev- elations? For this reason we have repeated from our forefathers their rapture and the revelation of each one, namely, for the sake of the considerations of those who have put on unbelief and who think they know something about this revelation and vision of our father Mani, that they might acknowledge that such was also the commission given to the earlier messengers. For when each of them was snatched up, all these things that he saw and heard he wrote down and set forth, and he himself became a witness of his own revelation. But his students became seals of his position as messenger. 11 BARAIES THE TEACHER: MANI IS CHOSEN FROM AMONG THE ELKESAITES We, then, brothers, being children of the spirit of our father Mani, who also have heard and listened to these things, 12 thus let us rejoice in them and 8.

For in his twenty-fifth year the twin was revealed magnificently to him. 13 For while he was still in that sect of the baptists, he was like a lamb dwelling in a strange flock, or like a bird living with other birds of a different song. For al- ways with wisdom and skill he dwelt in their midst during all that time: none of them recognized him as to who he was, or what he had received, or what had been revealed to him. Rather, they regarded him among themselves in this manner, according to the standards of the body. ABIESOUS THE TEACHER AND INNAIOS BROTHER OF ZABED: MANI REJECTS EARTHLY TREASURES FOR DIVINE ONES The lord Mani said, \"When I was dwelling in their midst, one day Sitaios, the elder of their council, the son of Gara, took me by the hand, because he greatly loved me and regarded me as a beloved son. He took me, then, by the hand—no one else was with us—and went, dug up and showed me very great treasures, which he kept secretly buried. He said to me, 'These treasures are mine and I have con- trol of them. From now on they will be yours. For I love no one else like you, and to you I shall give these treasures.' When he had thus spoken to me I said in my heart, 'My most blessed father preferred me and has given to me an im- mortal treasure that does not pass away. Whoever inherits it will receive im- mortal life from it.' 14 \"Then I spoke to Sitaios the elder: 'Where are the forefathers, who acquired these earthly treasures before us, they who inherited them? For, consider, they are dead and gone and they did not keep them as their own, neither did they carry them off with themselves.'\" He, Mani, spoke to him: '\"What good, then, are these treasures to me, which introduce sins and of- fenses to everyone who acquires them? For the treasure of god is very great and exceedingly rich and will bring everyone who inherits it to life.' 15 When 13. When Mani was twenty-four, his twin appeared and told him to begin preaching the new thought. 14. Or \"from him\" (the father). 15.

I saw in the midst of it a foundation laid and of very great height, and over it alone a light rising, and a road laid upon it, and myself walking on this. When I turned round I beheld Sita, holding on to some person who was held by someone else, and perishing in the midst of the sea and the darkness, after he had fallen and gone under the surface. I could see only a little bit of his hair, so that I was distressed greatly on account of Sita. But that one who cast him out said to me, 'Why are you distressed about Sita? For he is not of your elect, nor will he walk on your way.' Then, when I saw these things, I revealed nothing to him, Sita. But later, when I was preaching the word of truth, I saw him oppos- ing my teaching.\" BARAIES THE TEACHER: MANI DEBATES THE ELKESAITES ABOUT OBSERVANCE My lord Mani said, \"I have had enough debating with each one in that law, rising up and ques- tioning them concerning the way of god, the commandments of the savior, the washing, the vegetables they wash, and their every ordinance and order ac- cording to which they walk. 17 \"Now, when I destroyed and put aside their words and their mysteries, demonstrating to them that they had not received these things that they pur- sue from the commandments of the savior, some of them were amazed at me, but others got cross and angrily said, 'Does he not want to go to the Greeks?' 18 When I saw their intent, I responded, gently, 'This washing by which you wash 16.

You can see how, whenever someone cleanses his food and par- takes of that food that has just been washed, it seems to us that from it still come blood and bile and flatulence and excrements of shame and the defile- ment of the body. But if someone were to keep his mouth away from this washed food for a few days, immediately all these offals of shame and loath- someness will be recognized as lacking and wanting in the body. But if that one were to eat of food again, in the same way the offals would again abound in the body, so that it is clear that they swell from the food itself. But if some- one else were first to partake of food that is washed and cleansed, and then partake of food that is unwashed, it is clear that the beauty and the power of the body is recognized as the same in either case. Likewise, the loathsomeness and dregs of both types of food are seen as not differing from each other, so that what has been washed, which the body rejected and sloughed off, is not at all distinguishable from that other, which is unwashed.\" 19 WHAT PURITY REALLY IS '\"Now the fact that you wash in water each day is of no avail. For having been washed and purified once and for all, why do you wash again each day? So that also by this it is manifest that you are disgusted with yourselves each day and that you must wash yourselves on account of loathsomeness before you can become purified. And by this too it is clear most evidently that all the foulness is from the body. And indeed, you also have put the body on. 20 \"Therefore, make an inspection of yourselves as to what your purity really is. 21 For it is impossible to purify your bodies completely, since each day the body is disturbed and comes to rest through the excretions of feces from it, so that the action comes about without a commandment from the savior. The purity, then, which was spoken about, is that which comes through knowl- edge, a separation of light from darkness, of death from life, of living waters from turbid, so that you may know that each is different from the other and you may keep the commandments of the savior, so that he might redeem the soul from annihilation and destruction. This is in truth the genuine purity, which you were commanded to do; but you departed from it and began to bathe, and have held on to the purification of the body, a thing most defiled 19- Washing food does not remove defilement.

Some of them regarded me as a prophet and teacher. Some of them were saying, 'A living word is uttered by him; let us make him a teacher of our doctrine.' Others were saying, 'Has a voice really spoken to him in se- cret, and does he say those things that it revealed to him?' Some were saying, 'Did something appear to him in a dream, and does he tell of what he saw?' Others were saying, 'Is this really the one about whom our teachers prophe- sied, saying, \"A certain young man will rise up from our midst and a new teacher will come forth to overturn all our teaching in the way our forefathers spoke concerning the rest 22 of the garment\"?' Others were saying, 'Surely, then, is it not error that speaks through him, and does he not wish to lead our people astray and divide our teaching?' Others of them were filled with jeal- ousy and rage, some of whom were voting for my death. \"Others were saying, 'He is the enemy of our law.' Some were saying, 'He wishes to go to the gentiles and eat Greek bread, for we have heard him saying, \"It is necessary to partake of Greek bread.\" Likewise, he says it follows to par- take of drink, bread, vegetables, and fruit, which our fathers and teachers en- joined us not to eat. Further, the washing by which we wash ourselves he destroys and does not wash himself like us, nor does he wash his food as we do.' \"So, then, when Sita and his companions saw that I would not give in to their testing, but that little by little I was destroying and rejecting their own law and the food that they rejected, and that I was not practicing the washing as they were; when they saw me opposing them in all these things, then Sita and the group of his fellow presbyters set up a synod on my account. They also summoned the master of the house, Pattikios, and said to him, 'Your son has turned aside from our law and wishes to go into the world.

You have been like a demure young girl in our midst. Now what has happened to you, what has appeared to you? For you oppose our law and destroy and reject our teaching.

Why, then, do you now de- stroy the washing of our law and that of the fathers, in which we have walked from of old? You even destroy the commandments of the savior; you even wish to eat wheat bread and vegetables, which we do not eat. Why do you live so, not submitting to till the earth like us?'\" MANI APPEALS TO THE EXAMPLE OF JESUS AND HIS STUDENTS \"Then I said to them, 'In no way would I destroy the commandments of the savior. But if you reproach me on account of wheat bread, because I have said, \"It is necessary to eat of it,\" this the savior has done; as it is written, that when he had blessed it and shared it with his students, \"over bread he said a blessing and gave it to them.\" 24 Was not that bread from wheat? The scripture points out that he reclined to eat with tax collectors and idolaters. 25 Likewise, he also reclined to eat in the house of Martha and Mary on the occasion when Martha said to him, \"Lord, do you not care enough for me so as to tell my sister to help me?\" and the savior said to her, \"Mary has chosen the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.\" 26 Consider, moreover, how even the students of the savior ate bread from women and idolaters and did not separate bread from bread, nor vegetable from vegetable; nor did they eat, while laboring in 23.

When he was going to bathe in the waters, an image of a man appeared to him from the source of the waters, saying to him, 'Is it not enough that your animals injure me, but do you yourself also mistreat me without reason and profane my wa- ters?' 28 So Elkesai marveled and said to it,'Fornication, defilement, and impu- rity of the world are thrown into you and you do not refuse them, but are you grieved with me?' The water said to him, 'Granting that all these have not rec- ognized me as to who I am, you, who say that you are a servant and righteous, why have you not guarded my honor?' \"And then Elkesai was upset and did not bathe in the waters. \"Again, a long time after, he wished to bathe in the waters. He commanded his students to look out for a place not having much water, so that he might bathe. His students found such a place for him. As he was about to bathe, the image of a man appeared to him again, a second time, from that source, say- ing to him, \"We and those waters in the lake are one. You have come, therefore, even here to wrong and injure us.\" 29 Trembling greatly and upset, Elkesai al- lowed the mud upon his head to dry, and thus he pointed it out.\" 30 Again he, Mani, demonstrates that Elkesai had plows in storage and went to them.

Why do you carry us away to the fornicators?\" Thus Sabbaios was upset on account of what he heard and returned the vegetables.

While Mani had enjoyed support from the Persian king Shapur I, with the advent of Bahram I his fate changed. The Zoroastrian magi were eager to consolidate their national religion and to halt the spread of Manichaeism and Christianity. The high priest Karder, who appears in the text, may have engineered Mani's imprisonment and death. After the unfortu- nate audience with the king, Mani was fettered and taken away in chains. While in his cell, he was apparently able to speak to his close followers, and during these days he designated his twelve messengers and seventy-two bish- ops, who would form the clerical structure of his church. The story of his ex- ecution parallels the story of the death of Jesus in the New Testament gospels, including the Gospel of John.

THE STORY OF THE DEATH OF MANI 1 BAH RAM I AND MANI Mani came to the audience of Bahram I, after the king had summoned me— Nuhzadag the interpreter—and Kushtai the scribe, and Abzakhya the Persian. The king was at the dinner table and had not yet washed his hands nor fin- ished his meal. The courtiers entered and said, \"Mani has come and is standing at the door.\" The king sent the lord the message, \"Wait awhile until I can come to you myself.\" Then the lord again sat down to one side of the guard and waited there until the king had finished his meal, when he was to have gone hunting. The king stood up after his meal. After putting one arm around the queen of the Sakas and the other around Karder, 2 son of Ardavan, he came to the lord. His first words to the lord were, \"You are not welcome here.\" \"Why? What wrong have I done?\" replied the lord. \"I have sworn an oath not to let you come to this land!\" And then he an- grily told the lord, \"What good are you? You don't fight or go hunting. Perhaps you are needed for doctoring and healing, but you don't even do that!\" Then the lord told him, \"I have done you no evil. I have always done good in tending you and your family. And I have freed a multitude of your ser- vants from demons and witches. And I caused many to rise from their sick- nesses. I have held down the fever of many. And many who died I brought back to life.\" i. The Story of the Death of Mani: translated by Jes P.

THE EARTH TREMBLES AS HE ENTERS NIRVANA On the fourth of the month of Shahrevar, on Monday at the eleventh hour, when he had prayed, Mani shed the wonted garment of the body. Like the swift lightning he gleamed brighter than the light of the sun, the chariot glittered, and the messengers spoke and greeted the just god. The sides of the house of the sky broke. The earth trembled. A mighty voice was heard, and people who saw this sign were confused and fell on their faces. 8 It was a day of pain and a time of sorrow when the messenger of light entered death, when he entered the complete nirvana. 9 COMMANDS FROM THE CHARIOT OF WATER He left behind the leaders guarding the church.

Usually contextual or historical detail is missing. The body of the chapter is then taken up with a summary of doctrine on that particular question which convinces all listeners; and may then end with a prayer of praise for Mani and thanks for his revelation. 1 Here two Kephalaia are given, 26 and 38. In Kephalaion 26 Mani tells five stories or parables about the primal man, the third messenger, and the role of the living spirit in bringing redemption. In Kephalaion 38 Mani offers a Manichaean cosmogony. He describes the universe in human form, and he re- lates the cosmic human to the individual human. Thus the cosmogonic ac- count, for all its complexity, becomes the story of the individual person living out his or her life.

The process is like mind who was great and exalted, and now he is bent over and become small in this small worthless body. While the gods in the outer zone are transcendent and pure, they are involved in the mingling into the entirety but are not defiled. This too is like the light mind. Consider the might and actions of the light mind. How vast he is over the keepers of the watch of the body! He stays in his camp. He closes down the body's deliberations from the temptations of sin. He limits them and scatters them. He puts them down at his will. He does another work surpassing the others. He bestows a great spirit over the elect. Now you may find him standing on the earth, rising up in his heart and ascending to the father, the god of truth, he who exists and is established above all things without loss. And again he may push down in his insight and consideration and descend to the land where darkness poured out. His heart will run and touch everything. 39 Then Mani says to the student: I have taught you the deeds of the light mind. Whoever has an open and perceptive eye, the light mind can appear to him.

There was a horde of angels in the land of light, ready to pour out and break the father's enemy. They were pleased to have the father's word to rout those rebels who saw themselves exalted. The angels were like a shepherd who sees a lion padding near to destroy the fold, who cunningly takes a lamb and sets it as a snare to catch the lion. With a single lamb he saves his fold, heals the lamb, and wounds the lion. Such is the way of the father who sent forth his strong son and made from himself his virgin armed with five powers to fight the five abysses of the darkness. When the watcher stood at the borders of light, he showed them to the virgin who is his soul. In their abysses they stirred, desiring her. They opened their mouth to swallow her.

During the first centuries BCE Parthia was a vast empire extending from the Indian Ocean through Afghanistan, Persia, and east to Syria, but it declined when it was finally conquered by the Persians in 226 CE. The first song, entitled Huyadagman (after the opening line, \"How good for us,\" or \"How fortunate we were\"), is a long poetic composition originally of four hundred verses, which are divided into cantos. It is preserved in a Parthian version, a Sogdian version (from Sogdiana, a province of Persia that included Bukhara and extended through Samarkand), a Chinese version (with a good deal of Buddhist language), and Turkish fragments. Sections from the Parthian version are translated here. The second collection of songs, entitled Angad Rosnan (after the opening line, \"Deep companion of the beings of light,\" or \"Bountiful friend of the beings of light\"), is also a long composi- tion, and some of its apocalyptic themes are paralleled in the Apocalypse of Thomas. Both hymn cycles are said to have been composed by Mani's student Mar Ammo in the mid-third century. These songs (all fragments from larger lost compositions) contain the essential range of themes in the life of a prac- ticing gnostic. They speak of a soul in distress that is threatened by personal weaknesses and surrounded by dangers from all sides, the soul's fervent long- ing for salvation, the coming of the savior, and hence the promise to begin a journey to the new paradise.

This second song, not given here, is much shorter. It rehearses much of the same material about Mani, but adds references to the god Ohrmazd and the god Zurvan, figures equated with aspects of the divine in Persian Manichaeism (for example, the first man) and derived from the Zoroastrian good god Ohrmazd (Ahura Mazda) and the divine principle of infinite time Zurvan. Both songs praise Mani in terms that are distinctly Bud- dhist, reflecting the years of exile that Mani was said to have spent in India, where he was exposed to the word and worship of the Buddha. In the Great Song, Mani is described as teacher of what Jesus taught and au- thor of a gospel book (probably the Living Gospel), but he is also addressed as Buddha Mani. The song alludes to aspects of the three jewels of Buddhism, the Buddha (who is Mani), the dharma (or law), and the sangha (or religious community).

In this part we consider Islamic mystical literature in general, and the Mother of Books in particular, as an example of the rich and diverse mystical heritage of Islam. MUHAMMAD THE SEAL OF THE PROPHETS In the cultural and religious mix of late sixth-century Arabia, Muhammad was born into the Hashimite clan of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca. The religious cli- mate of Arabia during his day was substantially Semitic, with a variety of ex- pressions. The faiths of Arabia were faiths of the desert, faiths that developed from Babylonian and Zoroastrian roots and from Jewish and Christian faiths of one sort or another. Caravans had traversed the trade routes of Arabia for a very long time, and with the caravans came cultural traditions and connec- tions. Hence, some of the deities of Arabia had even been accorded Greco- Roman names and identities. In Mecca three such goddesses were called daughters of the god Allah. These goddesses are al-Lat, a mother goddess who may be linked to the sun; al-Manat, the goddess of fate; and al-Uzza, the goddess of the morning star. Al-Uzza—sometimes connected to Venus (Aphrodite), Fortuna, and Isis— ruled the stone city of Petra, with Dushara, and the three daughters of Allah still assert themselves in Salman Rushdie's book The Satanic Verses. Allah, in turn, was the creator god. His name means \"god\" or \"the god,\" and he was wor- shiped in Mecca by Muhammad and the members of the Quraysh tribe."},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"658  ISLAMIC MYSTICAL LITERATURE Muhammad was a reflective, brooding person of around forty, it is said, when he wandered off to a cave near Mt. Hira, just north of Mecca, fell into meditation, and received a revelation from Allah. The vision is described in sura 96 of the Qur'an: \"In the name of god, the merciful, the compassionate. Recite: in the name of your lord who created, created man of a blood clot. Re- cite: and your lord is the most generous, who taught by the pen, taught man what he knew not.\" l Later Muhammad reflected upon the circumstances of his vision at Mount Hira: \"One night,\" the prophet says, \"Gabriel came to me with a cloth as I slept and said, Recite! I answered, I cannot recite. So he choked me with the cloth until I believed that I should die I awoke from my sleep, and it was as if they had written a message in my heart.\" 2 Muham- mad went out of the cave and saw a vision of Gabriel, who appeared every- where on the horizon. Such visions, which recurred over a period of time, could take different forms. Once, thinking about his visions, Muhammad observed, \"I hear loud noises, and then it seems as if I am struck by a blow. I never receive a revela- tion without the consciousness that my soul is being taken away from me.\" Again, \"The revelation comes to me in two ways. Sometimes Gabriel visits me and tells it to me as though one man were speaking to another, but then what he speaks is lost to me. But sometimes it comes to me as with the noise of a bell, so that my heart is confused. But what is revealed to me in this way never leaves me.\" 3 Gradually Muhammad came to the realization that he was a prophet (nabi) and messenger (rasul, apostle) of Allah, and his visions became the basis for the Qur'an. So Muhammad proclaimed Islam, submission to Allah, who is ac- claimed the one and only god, the god of Jews, Christians, and Muslims. According to Islam, Muhammad is a prophet and the seal of the prophets, the prophet whose distinction is that the Qur'an was revealed through him. Yet the Qur'an insists that Muhammad is the last in a long series of prophets. The prophetic line is said to include such venerable people of god as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, John the baptizer, Jesus—and, of course, Muhammad. This concept of the prophetic line recalls similar emphases on a series of prophets in other traditions, particularly in Manichaeism. Manichaeism pro- fessed that a series of people in the past functioned as messengers (apostles) 1. Adapted from Arberry, ed., The Koran Interpreted. 2.

This observation leads Kurt Rudolph, the prominent scholar of gnosti- cism, to draw a provocative conclusion: Manichaeism, which flourished longer in the Orient, found its reflection in early Islamic theological trends, apparently most ef- fectively in the book of the Arab prophet himself. Mohammed, according to the Qur'an, advocates the same cyclic theology of revelation as the gnostic prophet Mani from Mesopotamia, and stands similarly at the end of a series of forerunners who pro- claimed the same as he did, but with less success, and whose teaching was falsified by their followers. Mohammed has the same predilection for the Old Testament figures from the Penta- teuch as has Mani. But their view of the world and their doctrine of salvation are almost in opposition and separate them; they are united in their claim to be the last prophet of a very ancient his- tory of salvation. Mani's work has vanished in history, while Mohammed's foundation, thanks to a different point of depar- ture that had a more positive attitude to the world, developed into the greatest post-Christian world religion, a fame which Mani was also able to claim for a time. 4 JESUS THE SAGE IN ISLAM The role of prophet Jesus (in Arabic, Tsa) in Islam may be secondary to that of prophet Muhammad, but Jesus remains a glorious prophet and sage. Within Islam Jesus is confessed to be not only a prophet of god but also the messiah, servant, spirit, and word of god, the son of Mary, who spoke words of wisdom and performed mighty deeds as he taught submission to Allah. At the end of a remarkable life he died—or perhaps he only to seemed to die, says the Qur'an, in terms that bring to mind the unreal death of Jesus in the Second Treatise of the Great Seth and the Revelation of Peter in the Nag Hammadi library, as well as other gnostic sources.

Many more sayings of Jesus are collected in other Islamic sources, and they merit close examination. 5 Many are wisdom sayings. Taken together, these Islamic sayings of Jesus pres- ent a picture of Jesus that may be compared to that of Q and the Gospel of Thomas, discussed at the beginning of this volume. The Muslim who collected and edited many of these sayings of Jesus is Abu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali. Al-Ghazali was an eleventh- to twelfth-cen- tury Muslim scholar, theologian, and mystic who wrote numerous books, the greatest of which is Ihya 'ulum al-din (The revival of the religious sciences). 6 He composed this book following a period of turbulence in his life, when he had retired from his professorial position in Baghdad and had begun a life of meditation as a Sufi. This magnificent work, four volumes in length, is divided into four major \"quarters,\" which deal with issues of religious practice, social customs, vices, and virtues, and contain ten books each, for a total of forty books. In this massive work al-Ghazali discusses the provisions of the Shari'a (Islamic law), and he addresses the reader on the devout life of a Muslim, in- cluding the mystical life. Within the work al-Ghazali cites sayings of Jesus. The following are a few of the sayings of Jesus quoted in al-Ghazali's Re- vival of the Religious Sciences: Jesus said, \"Whoever knows and does and teaches will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\" (1.8) Jesus said, \"Do not offer wisdom to those who are not worthy of it, or you might harm it, and do not withhold it from those who are worthy of it, or you might harm them. Be like a gentle doctor who puts the medicine in the diseased spot. Whoever offers wis- dom to those who are not worthy of it is a fool, and whoever with- holds it from those who are worthy of it is an evildoer. Wisdom 5.

And evil scholars are like the drainpipe of a latrine that is plastered outside but filthy inside; or like graves that are decorated outside but contain dead people's bones inside.\" (1.49; similar sayings are found in Matthew 23:27-28 [Q]; Luke 11:44 [Q]; Gospel of Thomas 39,102; and in Aesop's fable of the dog in the manger) Jesus was asked, \"Who taught you?\" He answered,\" No one taught me.

The students said, \"How this dog stinks!\" But Jesus said, \"How white are its teeth!\" (3.108) One day Jesus was greatly troubled by the rain and thunder and lightning, and he began to seek shelter. His eye fell on a tent some distance away, but when he came to it, he found a woman inside, so he turned away from it. Then he noticed a cave in a mountain, but when he came to it, there was a lion in it. Laying his hand on the lion, he said, \"My god, you have given everything a resting place, but to me have you given none.\" Then god revealed to him, \"Your resting place is the house of my mercy.\" (3.153; see also Matthew 8:20 [Q]; Luke 9:58 [Q]; Gospel of Thomas 86)"},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"662 ISLAMIC MYSTICAL LITERATURE Jesus said, \"Whoever seeks the world is like one who drinks sea- water.

Then he saw a person combing his beard with his fingers, so he threw away the comb, and he saw another per- son drinking from a river with his hands, so he threw away the jug. (4.182; a similar story is told about Diogenes the Cynic philosopher) Additionally, in an inscription from a mosque at Fatehpur Sikri, India (also known from the Clerical Instruction of Petrus Alphonsi), Jesus says, \"This world is a bridge. Pass over it, but do not build your dwelling there.\" This resembles, as much as any other saying, Gospel of Thomas 42: \"Be passersby.\" ISLAMIC GNOSIS AND THE MOTHER OF BOOKS The Muslim devotees of the party (Shi'a) of Ali, now commonly called Shi'ites, emerged from the bleak and bloody times that saw the assassination of Ali, cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, and Ali's sons Hasan and Husayn. The commitments of these partisans of Ali included an insistence that the leaders of the Muslim community—the caliphs—be direct descen- dants of Muhammad, and that these leaders were legitimated by Allah and given knowledge by Allah. Among the early adherents of Shi'a were certain thinkers, called ghulat, \"exaggerators\" or \"extremists,\" who were referred to in this way because of their extreme devotion to the figure of Ali and whose per- spective could be messianic, mystical, even gnostic. Advocates of such ghuluw, 7. Pieces of money."},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"ISLAMIC MYSTICAL LITERATURE 663 \"exaggeration,\" included Abdallah ibn Saba, described by loan Culianu as \"the archheretic of Islamic ghuluw\"—a figure comparable to Simon Magus in the history of Christian gnosticism— who was devoted to Ali in Kufa, Iraq, and continued to be a proponent of Ali even after Ali's assassination. Eventually forms of Islamic exaggeration led to the development of several thinkers, ac- tivists, and schools of thought, some of them quite radical: Isma'ilites, Assas- sins, 'Alawites, Nusayris, Druzes, Sufis. loan Culianu speculates on the roots of these ghulat in Islam: How might gnostic myths have reached the Ghulat and the Is- ma'iliyah? They were probably transmitted by the so-called mawali, or \"clients,\" from Kufa. The mawali were foreigners con- verted to Islam after the conquest of Persia's capital, Seleucia- Ctesiphon . . . and its transfer to Kufa under the Umayyads (637-638 C.E.). Among the mawali, Jewish, Christian, Zoroas- trian, gnostic, and Manichaean ideas were represented. 8 Some of the ghulat put their speculative thought into literature. Two reve- latory texts that stem from these traditions are the Mother of Books ( Umm al- kitab) 9 and the Book of Shadows (Kitab al-azillah). A portion of the former work, the Mother of Books, is presented here. The Mother of Books comes from the late eighth century, from the town of Kufa, famous for its ghulat. It is a text that deals, like so much of the literature of gnosis in this volume, with creation and the proper interpretation of creation. The strongest case for a gnostic understanding of the Mother of Books has been made by Heinz Halm. 10 Halm understands the Mother of Books to present a gnostic mytho- logical account in Shi'ite form. The divine manifests itself in a fivefold fashion, reminiscent, suggests Halm, of the divine father's realm of five (pentad) in the Secret Book of John, but in the Mother of Books the five are identified with prophet Muhammad; his son-in-law, Ali; his daughter, Fatima; and his grand- sons, Hasan and Husayn. In Manichaean literature one of the ways the five is expressed is in five trees of paradise, a motif that also occurs in the Gospel of Thomas (saying 19). Five trees of paradise are also discussed in the Mother of Books. The arrogance of the gnostic world ruler, so central to gnostic cos- mogonies, finds its corollary in the Mother of Books in the arrogant Azazi'il. 8.

The selection from the Mother of Books presented here includes the major, revelatory section of the text, in which a revelation (in dialogue form) about the origin and meaning of the world is given (from Baqir, as revealer, to Jabir, as the recipient of the revelation and the dialogue partner who raises questions). The names of many of the figures in the revelation are derived from famous characters in Islamic and Shi'ite history. The revelation is a bril- liant text of epic poetry, with mythic color, apocalyptic fire, and mystical power. This revelation describes the glories, angels, and colors of the cosmic realm, along with the god who remains exalted above it all. Beginning with a long mystical exegesis of the Bismillah, the opening phrase of every sura in the Qur'an (\"In the name of Allah, the compassionate, the merciful\"), the text proceeds to demonstrate its points with reference to proof texts in the Qur'an and figures in Islamic lore. Throughout the revelation there are sec- tions that relate the cosmogonic descriptions to the individual and to the inner mystical quest for the divine. The revelation uses imagery that sometimes brings to mind the opening chapters of Genesis and gnostic interpretations of Genesis as it maintains that the world below comes from the arrogant, re- bellious Azazi'il. Eventually the world below literally becomes colorless. The benevolent will of god for the cosmos and the people in the cosmos is realized, however, through the actions of Salman, god's regent, who recalls the first human or Sophia (wisdom) in gnostic texts and who is described, as is the first human in many gnostic texts and Sophia in some gnostic texts (for example, Valentinian texts), as a higher figure and a lower figure. At last, the text proclaims, people may come to knowledge and be liberated. The Mother of Books provides four conditions for such salvation; a postscript to the revelation, part of which is presented here, adds an account of how the individual person may embrace mystical knowledge. In the postscript it is said that the one who seeks perfect knowledge will find it: The one who knows arises and testifies to spirit as to himself. The student will be perfect, and ten spirits are spoken for. God says, \"These are the perfect ten.\""},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"44 The Mother of Books THE ESSENTIAL MYSTERY Jabir rose to his feet, saying, \"My lord, tell me the meaning of the holy phrase, Bismillah al-rahman al-rahim.

They are also called Albigensians, a geographical reference, because among their main con- verts were the people in the Languedoc city of Albi. When the pope declared the crusade against the Cathars in 1209, he called it the Albigensian Crusade. The epithet Cathar was probably derived from the Greek katharoi (clean, pure) and designated the class of the perfect or elect. The name was already applied to the dualist community at Monteforte in Italy as early as 1030. The Cathars first appeared in northern Italy, and then in western Germany, England, and Flanders, but soon their major concentration was in Provencal- speaking southwestern France. By the end of the tenth century we hear of Ger- bert of Aurillac, archbishop elect of Reims, who issued a declaration of faith that included Manichaean dualistic doctrines and a rejection of the Old Tes- tament. 1 There is evidence of a continuity of Manichaean groups in France from the time (c. 370s CE) when Augustine, in his earlier Manichaean period, was exiled in Champagne and was actively proselytizing. Whatever the size and significance of these interesting relics of classical Manichaeism, however, the reappearance of a radical dualism in the region can be attributed to the Bogomils, a neomanichaean group from Macedonia and Bulgaria who, like the original adherents of Mani, quickly spread the fire of their doctrine from Europe and North Africa to China. This time the Bogomils carried their mes- sage through the Balkans and western Europe. Such was their impact that by the twelfth century the Cathars had their own network of bishoprics reaching T 1.

The spread of gnosticism in this area of western Europe also coincided in twelfth-century Languedoc with the emergence of Kabbalism. The Sefer ha- Bahir (Book of Bright Light) is, as Gershom Sholem demonstrates, an exam- ple of gnostic Kabbalism as well as the most significant extant document of medieval Jewish mysticism and symbolism. The many dissenting religious movements in this area of southern France made it a new Alexandria, where, as in the ancient hellenistic capital, diverse religions and philosophical move- ments flourished, including neoplatonism, hermeticism, Judaism, Christian- ity, and, a child of this diversity, gnosticism. BOGOMIL ROOTS OF THE CATHARS The legendary founder of Bogomil neomanichaeism was the tenth-century Slavic priest Bogomil, also called Theophilos. The Bogomils, who owed many ideas to the earlier Paulicians 2 in Armenia and the Near East, were the most powerful sectarian movement in the history of the Balkans. Predominantly Slavs with some Greek followers, they were a powerful force in Constantino- ple, Macedonia, and Bulgaria, and especially in Serbia and Bosnia, where they persisted for five centuries and for a period vied for dominance with ortho- doxy. In the capital city of Constantinople the Bogomils were a powerful pop- ulist movement that vigorously opposed Byzantine culture and theocracy. They fell into obscurity in the fifteenth century with the Ottoman conquest of Byzantium, but in their active years the Bogomils in the east, together with the Cathars in the west, formed a network of dualist communities from the Black Sea to the Atlantic. 2. A Christian sect that appears in Armenia in the sixth century and was associated with Nesto- rianism. This \"heretical\" sect favored Luke and the letters of Paul, hence the epithet Paulicians. By the seventh century it had spread through the Byzantine Empire. After being persecuted by the Byzantines, the Paulicians sided with the Muslims in their struggle against the Eastern Roman Empire. In the mid-ninth century they had their own state at Tephike (in present-day Turkey). In 871 the Byzantine emperor Basil I attacked them and they fled to Syria, and a cen- tury later they were expelled from Syria and combined with the Bogomils, largely Slavs, who were considered a barbaric menace to the Orthodox of Constantinople. After the eleventh cen- tury the Paulicians disappeared as a separate identity, but as a sect, now merged with the Bo- gomils, their missionaries emigrated to southwestern Europe, where they brought the essential neomanichaean texts, in Latin translation, that became the basic scriptures of Catharism."},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"CATHAR LITERATURE 731 BOGOMIL DUALISM, DOCETISM, AND POPULARISM Bogomillian and later Catharist ideas go back to the grand confusion of many earlier heretical sects, including the Marcionites, Borborites, Bardaisans, Mes- salians, Montanists, Adoptionists, and Monarchians, and the later sect in Dio- clea and Bosnia called the Patarenes (who after a migration to the west were eventually the Cathars of northern Italy). Many of these sects shared with the monophysites, and the Nestorians, 3 who still survive in large numbers in Mesopotamia and India, the essential docetic notion of Christ and Jesus as two figures, one divine and one human, and Christ as a phantom on the cross who only seemed to be human. Like earlier gnostics, the Bogomils held a dualistic view of soul and body, and of good and evil deities as evinced in the struggle between the good god of light and the demonic biblical god of darkness and error who created and trapped our souls in material, perishable bodies. Christ was an angel messen- ger of god. On earth, following the docetic interpretation of Jesus Christ, the Christ was not real flesh but a phantasm, his sufferings an illusion. The man Jesus was a prophet, the earthly counterpart of Christ the angel spirit. The Bogomils replaced biblical myth, as did the earlier gnostics, with an elaborate cosmogony and theogony of their own, and rejected much of the Old Testa- ment, whose deity they considered to be Satan. They utterly opposed most of the church structure, symbology, and doctrine—hierarchy, saints, sacra- ments, relics, the cross, the trinity, and the divinity of Mary. They detested the cross as the instrument of Christ's murder. They aimed early Christian iconoclasm at Orthodox icons, which they called idols. As for their comport- ment, they drank no wine, ate no meat, and were essentially pacifists practic- ing passive resistance. And they took a politically populist view, denouncing 3. The Nestorians, who believed that the human and divine natures remained distinct in Jesus, hold a position that may be contrasted with the Catholic view pronounced by Saint Cyril of Alexandria that Jesus was two natures inseparably joined in one person, and the monophysite belief that Jesus Christ was composed of a single nature, a belief that, in certain expressions, could tend toward docetism. Monophysite christologies are to be found in eastern churches of the Levant to the present day. Docetic interpretations, such as those represented among some of the gnostics discussed in this volume, suggest that the real Christ only seemed to be human. At times docetists maintain that Jesus was human and represented a human being, while Christ was a phantom, appearance, or illusion of Jesus, whom people mistook for Jesus, and whose appearance represented god."},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"732 CATHAR LITERATURE the wealth and opulence of the Byzantine Church and seeking to liberate the Slavic serfs from serfdom. THE BOGOMILS SPREAD TO THE WEST In the eleventh century the Bogomils sent missionaries to spread their re- form—or heresy, in the eyes of the established church—into northern Italy and France, where the new orders retained the essential Bogomil theology and personal practice. The Cathars, however, extended the more restrictive reading of the Bogomils to include Paul, the gospels, and the Hebrew Bible, to which, in the manner of the earlier Alexandrian exegetes, they gave their own distinctive interpretation. In 1167 the Bogomils sent to Toulouse a major bishop, Nicetas, who instructed and gave prestige to the developing Cathar movement. And Bogomil scriptures appeared in Latin, one of which survives today: the Gospel of the Secret Supper, or John's Interrogation. This key and influential book came into hands of the French and Italian Cathars in Latin translation, probably from Byzantine Greek (the original was lost). It exists in two slightly different versions, one preserved in the archives of the Office of the Inquisition at Carcassonne and the second in the National Library of Vienna. CATHAR BRANDS OF DUALISM The Cathars of France and Italy are normally divided into two sects: absolute dualism and mitigated dualism. 4 Absolute dualism is more purely Manichaean, varying less from its Bogomil roots and using the traditional terms of Manichaean cosmogony. Mitigated dualism was dominant among the Cathars, however. Even the present form of the Gospel of the Secret Supper, or John's Interrogation, the major Bogomil text imported into France and used by the Cathars, the dualism is decisively mitigated, and the usual terms and personages of Manichaean dualism—aeons, archons, Sophia—are not used. Not even the name of Mani appears in it. Instead, the text is based on the gospels and a gnostic interpretation of them, and especially of the Gospel of 4. Normally the term Albigensians, the geographical epithet of the Cathars, is used inter- changeably with Cathars. Rene Nelli, however, distinguishes philosophically between the Albi- gensians, who had a more absolutist form of dualism that was closer to Manichaean roots, and the Cathars, whose dualism evolved toward their own interpretation and tends to be mitigated."},{"pageNumber":742,"pageContent":"CATHAR LITERATURE  733  John, which throughout has been favored among the canonical gospels by gnostics as one of their own. As a rule the gnostics have vigorously interpreted the Gospel of John, through elaborate exegesis, as gnostic scripture. The Cathars saw the Gospel of the Secret Supper, or John's Interrogation, as a purely Johannine gnostic text. It is a conversation between the evangelist John and god {le Seigneur) in which John interrogates le Seigneur about Satan before the fall, the creation, Adam and Eve, the descent of Jesus Christ, baptism by water and by spirit, and Satan's lake of fire and the invisible god's heaven. It is a Cathar variation of Christian myth. In contrast, the major extant Cathar text, known as the Book of the Two Principles, is a perfect example of absolute dualism, showing the relentless struggle between the god of goodness and the god of evil for dominion and belief among the unknowing. The god of goodness will be conquered in time but will be victorious in eternity when captive souls escape evil and return to light. Only then will evil be annihilated. As in classical Manichaean texts, a Cathar primordial human will also fight against evil and fail, as will the good angels. But their victory is not in defeating and punishing evil now—which they say is the way of the romains (the Catholics)—but in waiting until mat- ter annihilates itself, when nonbeing is truly nonexistent and light lives in eternity. In the absolute dualism of the Albanenses (an epithet for the absolute du- alists), the principle of good is entirely opposite to the principle of evil, as being is to nonbeing. The absolutists' god is limited ontologically to the good, without free will, because his power {lapuissance) and his will {la voluntee) are one and the same. He cannot and does not want to do evil. Nor can the good god create anyone with free will, such as a human who might do evil or a fa- vored angel Lucifer, who has the free will to become the evil devil. That task of creating evil, free will, and the demon god is left to the entirely separate entity of the principle of evil. It must be remembered that the principle of evil is the eternal principle, preceding the demon god of evil. The absolute and mitigated dualists also differed in their myths, though these differences are less significant than the conceptual differences of absolute versus relative separation of the good and evil principles. As an example of the mythic differences, the absolutist Albanenses believed that the demon of evil never managed to invade any of the seven levels of heaven and their cor- responding angels. The mitigated dualists believed that only the higher levels of heaven resisted the temptations of the fallen angel Lucifer, but that Lucifer could ever have been at any level of god's heaven was an idea abhorrent to the"},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"734 CATHAR LITERATURE absolute dualists. The good god could never have been the creator of a Lu- cifer who has the free will to become wicked. More prominent in mitigated dualism than in absolute dualism is the es- sential theory of emanation. For the mitigated dualists, there is only one orig- inal principle: the good god, from whom both Christ and Lucifer emanate. Lucifer, carrier of light, was originally good and sat next to god, but he became corrupted and corrupted his angels and they all became demons. For the ab- solute dualists, there are two principles: the principle of good and the princi- ple of evil, which is nothingness. Lucifer is Satan, the creature of nonbeing, of earth, which is the inferno where souls must wait for the possibility of re- demption and return to the light. Satan has always been evil, and of his own free will has imprisoned the good spirits (who lack free will) into earthly mat- ter. The good spirits on earth have not willingly sinned but have been forced into human bodies. Some modern scholars attempt to reconcile the two systems, saying that these two theses do not reflect fundamentally different worldviews but are simply different ways of explaining how Satan was tempted and absorbed by matter, how evil entered heaven, and how being was contaminated by nonbe- ing, all of which was inevitable when god chose to create. Such an argument is wrong, however, and reflects only the mitigated branch of Catharism. It must be remembered that the good god of absolute dualism is absolutely separate from any creation that could have led to evil. This separation from evil, how- ever, has interesting consequences in limiting the true god's power. God can- not create evil, and to that extent is not omnipotent like the good god of mitigated dualism. The absolute god seems to be \"all powerful\" yet remains limited because of his inability to concoct an evil universe. His purity and goodness limit him. Yet he still has contact with evil: the good god will spend eternity struggling with evil, and ultimately, as Jean de Lugio, the probable au- thor of the Book of the Two Principles, assures us, this good principle will overcome the wicked principle, being will vanquish nonbeing, and every soul infected with evil, except the principle of evil itself, will be redeemable, in- cluding Satan. Among the firm dualists, the devil's domain was this world of evil matter. This is why the good spirit will ascend to the spiritual domain while the mate- rial body must remain in this world. The Old Testament was the domain of the creator god and his patriarchs Abraham and Moses, who were villainous, al- though the other Old Testament prophets as well as the Songs (the Psalms) and the Song of Songs were accepted.

As for creat- ing more evil bodies, the perfect (or elect) chose abstinence. Some of the per- fect even chose endura, meaning they committed suicide through starvation. The believers, however, were freer than their Catholic counterparts. They could have sex outside of marriage, particularly if it did not lead to the con- ception of children and more trapped sparks of light. So marriage contained a dubious expression of sexuality, where conception was accepted as inevitable but regrettable. These reversals of Catholic principles were deeply repugnant to the established church. THE ROLE OF CHRIST In general the Cathar mythology of god and creation is, as in diverse gnostic texts, poetic, fantastic, and contradictory. With so much of our knowledge still dependent on summaries in archival documents of the Inquisition in France and Italy, the nature of Cathar thought is difficult to classify neatly. Christ, for example, is seen in sundry ways. All Cathar texts agree that he is not the son of god, nor is he god by another name. He is god's first angel. Some declare that because he fought the demon and was not contaminated, he earned the title— but just the title, not the fact—of son of god. Others among the mitigated du- alists claim that Christ's soul is god. All agree that to save souls he had to come to earth and suffer—either by giving the appearance of suffering and sacrific- ing himself in the phantasm of a Christ figure, or, as some believed, by be- coming a man and truly suffering the passion. Another reason Christ was sent below by the father was to instruct people that the god they worshiped in the churches, the god of the Bible, was none other than the devil. LES BONNES-HOMMES AND POPULARISM The Cathars also adopted from the Bogomils a populist mode that esteemed beggars, itinerant monks, and the common good people, which is to say, the peasants. Indeed, while the Cathar theologians and ascetics also had their in- evitable hierarchy, they held on to modest titles, even for the perfects, as in la bona gen (Provencal) and le bon homme (French), both meaning \"a good per- son.\" The notion of the good everywhere in the celestial realm was at the core of Catharism and has led scholars to speak of a pantheistic good. In the words"},{"pageNumber":745,"pageContent":"736 CATHAR LITERATURE of Steven Runciman, \"The Cathars were essentially believers in pantheism throughout the celestial realm. That is to say, good to them was God.\" 5 And on earth that good should be fairly shared, including a knowledge by the people of the scriptures, which speak the good, meaning that holy text is not the sole province of clergy. Hence the abundant translation of texts into the vernacu- lar tongue (Provencal). It is fair to say that this anticlerical, populist strain in the middle ages was not restricted to the Cathars. The Lollards in England and the Carmelite descalzos (the unshod) in Spain were other attempts to return to the truth or legend of the early Jewish-Chris- tian peasant movement, derived from the communal poor, for whom spirit was stronger than gold or power. All were swiftly denounced and persecuted as heresy. 6 THE PERFECT AND THE BELIEVERS Among the ordinary people of Toulouse and other cities in Languedoc, there were two groups of the faithful Cathars: the perfect (also known as the par- fait, bon-homme, elect, or purists) and the much larger ranks of believers (also known as the credentes or hearers). The perfect were ascetic clergy, de- voting themselves to contemplation and following strict moral rules, who forswore meat, cheese, sex, and other worldly pleasures. To pass into the ranks of the perfect, one received the sacrament of consolamentum, a laying on of hands. The believers were the lay people, who were peasants, a mobile merchant class, and even a majority of the southern lower nobility as well as greater nobles such as Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, Count Raymond- Roger of Foix, and Roger II, Viscount of Beziers and Carcassonne. The move- ment also included an unusually large number of very active women, both at the perfect and believer levels. There was a clear division of acceptable behav- ior for the two divisions of Catharists, and the believer caste was exception- ally free from ascetic restraints. The devotion by Cathar credentes to diverse regional arts was not only tol- erated but encouraged. Consequently, the arts flourished in Toulouse and other Cathar cities when northern France lived under a darker light. Southern France had the song of the aristocratic troubadour composer and the joglar 5. Runciman, The Medieval Manichee, 149. 6.

In short lyric or ballad, they recounted ad- ventures and misadventures of carnal and spiritual love. Their cult of courtly love commingled with a fully secular expression in an accessible vernacular tongue, and they opened worlds of courtly love from which we have, fortu- nately perhaps, never recovered. Indeed, it is a commonplace to say that the first lights of the renaissance, even before the radiant sonneteers of the royal courts of Sicily, shone in the free-spirited Midi of southern France. CATHAR AS HERESY AND PAPAL RESPONSE From the point of view of church orthodoxy in France and Italy, however, this popular religion was increasing at an alarming rate. Its dualistic, anticler- ical, and worldly stance was a diabolic heresy and its suppression inevitable. When it came, the punishment was catastrophic. The fall of the Cathars had levels of political complexity, with diverse Spanish, northern French, Italian, and even English interests vying for a piece of the destruction. Pope Innocent III made the first decisive move, proclaiming the Albigensian Crusade in 1209 against the gnostic heresy, calling in secular forces against the dualists, whom he offered the same indulgences as given to crusaders: spiritual salvation and material riches. The papal troops ravaged Toulouse, and in southern France thousands were slaughtered or burned at the stake. Churches and monaster- ies were razed, and scriptures burned. Many of the nobility lost their lands and were also burned. Later the northern barons, under the French king Saint Louis IX, invaded, and in 1244 they captured the last Cathar fortress, the famous mountaintop Montsegur in the Pyrenees, bringing the independ- ent region of the south into a larger France. For the French king his invasion was not a crusade against Cathar heresy but a war of annexation. With the fall of the citadel at Montsegur and the capitulation of the nobil- ity, the Catharist communities went underground. There was a large immi- gration to Catalonia and Lombardy, and also to Bosnia, where the Bogomils offered them sanctuary. As for the Cathar church in France, it was not yet completely crushed, but the great cities of the south—Toulouse, Beziers, Car- cassone, and Narbonne—lay in ruins.

He gave the task to the Dominicans friars. So was born the medieval Inquisition, which later spread to northern Italy and Germany. (The Spanish Inquisition established by Ferdinand and Isabella in Spain in 1478, with its notorious autos-da-fe, was independent of the medieval Inquisition elsewhere in west- ern Europe and was finally abolished in 1834.) The Dominican inquisitors la- bored through southern France in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries to extinguish virtually all discoverable remnants of the heretical religion. The In- quisition kept records of their activities and preserved the documents of heresy in their archives. We owe our detailed historical knowledge of these events and of Cathar scripture to these documents. The Inquisition and the Vatican found not only Catharism subversive, but also the troubadours, the great symbol of Occitanian and general Provencal culture. Many of the troubadours were Cathars, and of these, some of the best known, such as Peire Cardenal, were strongly anticlerical, that is, anti-romains (anti-Catholic). The troubadour composers—and the jongleurs who per- formed the troubadour songs—vanished as their noble patrons had vanished in the massacres of the great families. With the destruction of the two dissent- ing movements, the Cathars of inner light and the troubadours of outer light, along with the supporting peasants, nobility, and their political protectors, power and culture in France moved from the prevailing langue d'oc (in Provencal, lenga d'oc) in the south to the bleak langue d'o'il north, and the bril- liant Provencal civilization faded forever. 7 SURVIVAL OF SCRIPTURES The literature of the Cathars awaits the discovery of its own Nag Hammadi library of original gnostic scripture. We rely principally on five treatises, in- cluding the Gospel of the Secret Supper (La Cene secrete), the Anonymous 7. While Provencal was destroyed, its legacy was unstoppable. Meg Bogin summarizes: \"The troubadour's use of lenga d'oc spurred the development of poetry in all the other nascent lan- guages of Europe. By the beginning of the thirteenth century, imitations of the Provencal chan- son, or love song, were being written in Italian, German, Spanish, langue d'o'il [French] and even English. This medieval poetry produced a double legacy, which continues to determine a good portion of the western world of feeling. Through Dante's Beatrice, love was proclaimed the supreme experience of life, and the quest for love, with the lady as its guiding spirit, became the major theme of western literature\" (Bogin, Women Troubadours, 10)."},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"CATHAR LITERATURE 739 Cathar Treatise (Le Traite cathare anonyme), the Cathar Ritual (Le Rituel cathare), the Ritual of Dublin (Le Rituel de Dublin), and the extensive Book of the Two Principles (Le Livre des deux principes), as well as writings of the heresiologists deposited in the offices of the Inquisition, which were written to record the central doctrines, practices, and heresies of the Cathars. The Anonymous Cathar Treatise, for example, is a scholastic interpretation of ab- solute dualism, probably the work of Barthelemy of Carcassone, an antipa- pist Cathar who employed reason to prove his heretical faith. The treatise is included in the Book against the Manichaeans (Liber contra Manicheos), written in 1222 or 1224 and attributed to Durand de Huesca, in which the au- thor cites Cathar texts and then point by point refutes them, converting the book into a Catholic essay in itself.

It begins with a creation of the world. The imagery is as striking as that of Genesis or Revelation. The main character is Satan, shining white before his fall and burning red thereafter. Then Adam and Eve are created. After Satan and his reptile provoke the first couple's sin, the world, which is a mistake, is reigned over by Satan and his own angels. Jesus Christ descends. There is baptism by water and spirit, the eucharist, last judgment, and punishment of Satan. In the last part the invisible father speaks and controls the scene. The work begins as a strongly dualist text, immediately introducing two conflicting deities. The invisible father is not to be confused with the demi- urge creator in Genesis. There is the creator of good, who is the true lord, and the creator of evil, who is Satan and his contaminated creations. Humans have a spirit or soul, however, which permits them to return from the evil of the prison of earthly matter. This gospel or treatise is thus a mitigated dualist doc- ument, in that god is not entirely separated from the possibility of creating fig- ures who might do evil. There is an element of free will, which permits Adam and Eve to make their fatal choice. In a text like the Book of the Two Princi- ples, which is considered an absolute dualist document, however, free will does not exist. Otherwise god would have been guilty of creating angels and ultimately humans capable of choosing evil, which he cannot do or even wish to do. God is limited to doing good, and therefore there is a second presence who can and desires to do evil—the second absolute deity, the principle of evil. In absolute dualism there is an absolute distinction between good and evil and their mutual divine authors. After earlier gnostic conversation and narration, the scripture continues, moving toward a more conventionally Christian gospel, albeit with a reference to the crucifixion in which Christ is an angel, an illusion, a phantasm rather than the suffering Jesus. The last judgment, while it is linguistically fresh and the details of Satan's punishment are rich in apocalyptic images from late apocrypha, varies little, or not at all, from what it means and how it sounds in the New Testament. The way there is different, the deity above is other, but the conclusion is recognizably alike, with the invisible father substituting for the Christian god. In the early part the references are to Genesis and Isaiah, in the later part to the gospel of John, the preferred gospel in gnostic treatises. The Secret Supper and the Book of the Two Principles, which escaped the fire of wars and Inquisition, constitute the two main extant Cathar scriptures."},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"742 CATHAR LITERATURE THE GOSPEL OF THE SECRET SUPPER 1 WHO BROUGHT YOU HERE? I, John, who am your brother and share with you the tribulation of having shared the kingdom of the skies, since I was lying on the chest of our lord Jesus Christ, asked him, \"Lord, who brought you here?\" And he answered me, \"He who put his hand in the plate with me. 2 So Satan entered in him, and he, Judas, had already betrayed me.\" BEFORE SATAN FELL And I said, \"Lord, before Satan fell, what was his glory beside your father's?\" And he told me, \"Such was his glory that he governed the virtues of heaven. As for me, I sat next to my father. Satan was the master of all those who imi- tated the father, and his power descended from the sky to the inferno and rose again from the inferno to the throne of the invisible father. And he observed the glory of him who transformed the skies. And he dreamed of placing his seat on the clouds of heaven, because he wanted to be like the very high. 3 Then, having descended into the air, he said to the angel of the air, \"Open the gates of the air for me.\" And the angel opened the gates of the air. And he went on his way to the bottom. There he found the angel who guarded the waters, and he said to him, \"Open the gates of the waters for me.\" And the angel opened the gates of the waters. 4 Going ahead, he found the whole face of the earth and saw two fish who were stretched over the waters. 5 They were like two oxen joined together for plowing and, at the invisible father's order, they held up the earth, from sun- set to sunrise. i.

He went on until he got to his ossop, which is the principle of fire. 6 After that he could not descend farther because of the intense flame of the fire. Then Satan came in from behind and filled his own heart with malice, and reaching the angel of the air and the one who was above the waters, he said to them,\"Everything belongs to me. If you listen to me, I will place my seat on the clouds and I shall be similar to the very high. I will withdraw the waters of the upper firmament and assemble all the areas occupied by the sea into one entity of vast seas. That done, there will be no water on the face of the entire earth, and I shall reign with you through the centuries of the centuries.\" After he said this, the angel Satan rose toward the other angels to the fifth heaven, and to each of them he said, \"How much do you owe your masters?\" \"One hundred measures of wheat,\" one of them answered. \"Take pen and ink,\" he said to him, \"and write forty.\" He told the others, \"And you, how much do you owe the lord?\" \"One hundred jars of oil,\" he answered him. \"Sit down,\" Satan said to him, \"and write fifty.\" 7 He climbed into the skies, and with such words seduced the angels of the invisible father up to the fifth heaven. THE FATHER PITIES SATAN But a voice came out of the throne of the father, saying, \"What are you doing, denier of the father, you who are seducing the angels? Creator of sin, hurry with what you hope to do!\" 8 Then the father ordered his angels, \"Rip off their robes!\" The angels stripped all those angels who had listened to Satan of their robes, their thrones, and their crowns.

He dragged with his tail the third part of the an- gels of god, and he was hurled from his seat and from his domain in the skies. Descending to the firmament of the fallen angels, he found no place to rest for himself or for those who were with him. And he begged the father, saying, \"Be patient with me and I will return everything to you!\" 10 The father pitied him and gave him and those with him rest and permis- sion to do what he wished to do on the seventh day. SATAN REVEALS DRY LAND AND CREATES MAN AND WOMAN So he installed himself in his heaven and commanded his angels who were above the air and above the waters. He lifted two parts of the water, from bot- tom to top, into the air, and from the third part he made the sea, which became the mistress of the waters, but, according to the father's commandment, he also prescribed that the angel who was above the waters hold up the two fish. And he lifted the earth from bottom to top and dry land appeared. He took the crown of the angel who commanded the waters and from one half made the light of the moon, from the other the light of the stars. With precious stones he made the army of stars. Then he chose the angels for his ministers accord- ing to the celestial hierarchies established by the very high. And by command of the invisible father, he made thunder, the rains, the frosts, and the snows. He placed his angels as ministers over them to govern them. And he com- manded the earth to produce every kind of great beast, all reptiles, and trees and grasses. And he commanded the sea to produce fish and the sky birds. After that he reflected, and he made a man so that he might have a slave. He ordered the angel of the third sky to enter this body of mud, from which he then took out a part for making another body in the form of a woman. And he commanded the angel of the second sky to enter the body of the woman. But these angels wept when they saw that they had there an external mortal form and that they were dissimilar 1 1 in that external form. Satan joined them in this act of turning their bodies of mud into flesh. The angels did not perceive that in this way he also committed a sin.

Then he ordered the people to enter it and his angels to lead them to it. The devil planted a reed in the middle of paradise. And in one spit he made the serpent, whom he commanded to live in the reed. In such way the devil concealed his evil design so they might not know his trickery. And he entered paradise and spoke with them. He said to them, \"Eat from all the fruit that is found in paradise, but be- ware of eating the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil.\" However, the devil slipped into the body of the evil serpent and seduced the angel who was in the form of woman and he spread over her head the powerful desire of sin, and he satiated Eve with his bodily desire while he at- tended to the serpent's tail. 12 That is why humans are called the children of the devil and children of the serpent, because they serve the desire of the devil, who is their father, and will serve it until the consummation of this century. ADAM AND EVE CHOOSE SIN AND BECOME MORTAL Then, I, John, questioned the lord, \"How can one say that Adam and Eve were created by god and placed in paradise to obey the father's orders, but they were then delivered to death?\" The lord answered me, \"Listen, John, beloved of my father, it is the igno- rant who say, in their error, that my father made these bodies of mud. In real- ity he created all the virtues of heaven through the holy spirit. But it is through their sin that they found themselves with mortal bodies of mud and were con- sequently turned over to death.\" And again I, John, questioned the lord, \"How can a man become born in spirit in a body of flesh?\" And the lord answered, \"Descended from angels fallen from the sky, men enter the body of a woman and receive the desire of the flesh. Spirit is born then from the spirit and flesh from the flesh. 13 So Satan accomplishes his reign in this world and in all nations.\" He told me further, \"My father permitted him to rule seven days, which are seven centuries.\" 12.

I said to him, \"What did he do during all that time?\" And he told me, \"From the instant the devil was expelled from the glory of the father and was forbidden to take part in affairs of heaven, he sat on the clouds and sent his ministers, angels burning with fire, down below to the people. He did so from the time of Adam to Enoch. And he raised his minister Enoch above the firmament and revealed his divinity to him. 14 He had pen and ink brought to him. And once seated, Enoch wrote sixty-seven books under the devil's dictation, and the devil ordered him to carry them back to earth. Enoch kept them safely on the earth and then transmitted them to his chil- dren, and he began to teach them the way to celebrate sacrifices and iniquitous mysteries. So he concealed from people the kingdom of the skies. And Satan said to them, \"See that I am your god and that there is no other god but me.\" 15 That is why my father sent me into the world, that I make known and teach people to perceive the wicked spirit of the devil. But then Satan, having learned that I had descended from the sky to this world, sent his angel, and he took the wood of three trees and gave it to Moses so that I might be crucified on a cross made from the wood, which is at this time wait- ing for me. And he made his divinity known to his people, and ordered the law to be given to the children of Israel, and that he cross dry through the middle of the Red Sea. THE LORD INSEMINATES THE ANGEL MARY When my father thought of sending me to the earth, he sent before me his angel named Mary to receive me. Then I came down, 16 entered her by the ear, and came out of her ear. 17 14. In the Vienna version, the devil ravishes Enoch with ecstasy as he sends him on high. 15. Isaiah 45:5-6, 21; 46:9. This arrogant claim is commonly made by the creator of the world (for example, Yaldabaoth) in gnostic texts. 16. The Vienna version adds, \"she became my mother.\" 17. The notion that Mary was inseminated through the ear is based on noncanonical apocrypha and is found in medieval painting. Here Jesus as an angel inseminates his mother the angel Mary with his sperm through her ear. This notion of purity is doubly reinforced, since Mary will not have been inseminated normally, and the child will issue from her pure ear rather than from her loins."},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"CATHAR LITERATURE 747 And Satan, prince of this world, knew that I had come down to seek and save the beings who had perished, and he sent his angel the prophet Elijah down to earth to baptize in water.

The single incomplete manuscript in Latin is preserved in H the National Library of Florence. This book, in all about the length of a canonical gospel, is perfectly unified and consistent in its doctrine. It is an argumentum, always precise, sometimes colorful, but without prayers or rituals or songs, in favor of absolute dualism. The seven sections are \"Trea- tise on Free Will,\" \"On Creation,\" \"On Universal Signs,\" \"A Shorter Version for the Instruction of the Unknowing\" (part of which is translated here), \"Against the Garatenses\" (an argument about the superiority of absolute dualism over mitigated dualism), 1 \"On Free Will,\" and \"On Persecutions.\" The two treatises on free will (the first and sixth sections) detail a theme constantly alluded to in \"Instruction of the Unknowing\": the god of goodness cannot commit evil. This obviously limits the god's freedom of will and power. But, the treatise explains, since the god of goodness wants only to do good, he has no conflict within him: he and his will are one. The syllogistic reasoning is relentlessly consistent through the book. i. The Book of the Two Principles represents the Albanenses' view in favor of \"absolute dual- ism,\" which the probable author, Jean de Lugio, proposed, as opposed to \"mitigated dualism,\" which the Garatenses held to be true. In other ways the Albanenses and Garatenses were in agreement. The Albanenses, here represented in the Book of the Two Principles, were the only main Cathar sect to accept the authority of the entire Bible."},{"pageNumber":761,"pageContent":"752 CATHAR LITERATURE The good god's sole wish to do good—the principle of good—and the evil god's desire to inflict wickedness—the principle of evil—are elaborated throughout \"Instruction of the Unknowing.\" We have chosen this seminal and longest treatise in the Book of the Two Principles, with its focus on the two principles of the title, to represent the Cathar branch of absolute dualism. The author of these seven treatises, composed around 1250, is likely to have been Jean de Lugio (Giovanni de Lugio) of Bergamo, an absolute dualist, who was a vicaire of the Cathar church and major assistant to the bishop of Desen- zano in Italy. Our scant information about the author and even the attribution to Jean de Lugio comes from Rainier Sacconi, an Inquisitor and former Cathar priest, whose denunciations of the Cathars are contained in his Summa de Catharis. Sacconi discusses the rigorously philosophical basis of the writings. His summary and response actually refers to a larger, more inclusive volume. Preserved, however, is only this highly systematized metaphysical and polem- ical part—the rest is lost. Unlike the Gospel of the Secret Supper, which contains some pages of a cosmology and myth, the Book of the Two Principles is a scholastic argument, repeatedly documenting its message in biblical evidence. Proven by biblical example, Lugio's elaborate and logical argument will, he believes, inexorably lead all adversaries to reject the ways of the unknowing and to accept the Cathar truth. The reader is so instructed at the end of each segment. The trea- tise's gods mirror the deities of gnostic scriptures in which the invisible father is good and nameless while the biblical creator god, who takes on many noto- riously evil-sounding names, is evil. In brief, since god wants to do good and cannot do evil, he is not omnipotent but all powerful with regard to the good. Since there exists evil in the world, in the temporal and material world if not in his own eternal world, and since he the god of goodness cannot do evil or even create a being with free will to do evil, it follows that the evil, as well as the temporal world itself, has been created by a principle of evil. This princi- ple precedes the god of evil, Satan, and is unredeemable. But in the day of reckoning, even Satan the god of evil has a soul, and when free of the body, it may be elevated to spirit and find redemption. To prove that the biblical god is not the god of goodness, Lugio cites holy scriptures, seeking to demonstrate that the creator of the temporal universe is actually the demon, the principle of evil and creator of the infernal earth and its bodily inhabitants, in which our souls are imprisoned. The biblical god, he claims, is all iniquity: a fornicator, a destroyer and plunderer of village and"},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"CATHAR LITERATURE 753 city, a murderer of adults and little children, a liar who breaks oath promises. Once having understood these proved assertions, \"our adversaries\" should abandon the god of darkness, \"who is the cause and the principle of all iniq- uity and malice, of all bitterness and injustice,\" and turn to the true lord and god, \"who is the light, who is good and saintly, who is the living fountain and the origin of sweetness, of all tenderness and justice.\" In a typical passage of \"Instruction of the Unknowing\" Lugio takes a pas- sage from Deuteronomy (3:3-7) to show how the biblical god, principle of evil, urged his people to murder and plunder. \"So when king Sihon came out against us, he and all his people for battle at Jahaz, the lord our god gave him over to us; and we struck him down, along with his offspring and all his people. At that time we captured all his towns, and in each town we utterly de- stroyed men, women, and children. We left not a single survivor.\" The late scholar Rene Nelli, who wrote about Cathars and troubadours, comments astutely on this passage, finding parallels between biblical slaugh- ter and the fate of the Cathars before the Catholics: During the Crusade against the Albigensians, the Roman Catholics might have been able to authorize on the basis of these passages in the Bible the right to sack cities and castles and to ex- terminate the inhabitants, as they did many times. The Cathar morality, by contrast, formally condemned wars and massacres wherever they took place. Whatever one may say about it, Catharism represented then an indisputable moral progress. And even their refusal to attribute to a good god the horrors re- ported in the Bible is a measure of the change that they infused at that time in the conscience of the best of them. 2 The Cathars stood, then, in utter contrast to the crusading power-and-pillage portraits of soldiers of Christendom who dominated society during centuries of failed but devastating rampages to Jerusalem. Their inner light and obses- sion with goodness, peace, and justice are witnessed in the tragic history of their massacre and disappearance and in the luminous remnants of their song and scripture. 2.

As David said in the Psalms, \"The skies re- count the glory of god, and the firmament proclaims the works of his hands.\" 7 We read in Deuteronomy, \"Skies, listen to what I am going to say: that the earth understands the words of my mouth.\" 8 And in Isaiah, \"Skies, listen, and you earth, lend me your ear, because the lord has spoken.\" 9 Again in Jeremiah, \"Earth, earth, hear the word of the lord,\" 10 and in the Psalms, \"You have made yourself a road in the sea. You have walked amid the waters.\" 11 David refers to these ways when he says in the Psalms, \"All the ways of the lord are but mercy and truth.\" 12 Then by sky, earth, and sea we understand celestial beings.

ON THE OMNIPOTENCE OF THE TRUE LORD GOD I wish to speak now of the omnipotence of the true lord god, which so often permits our adversaries 26 to play the glorious one when they claim against us that there is no other force or power than theirs. Although in the testimony of the holy scriptures, the true lord god may be called all powerful, one must not believe that he is called that because he can do and does all evils, because there exist many evils that the lord cannot and will never do. As the Letter to the Hebrews says, \"It is impossible for god to lie.\" 27 And the same messenger declares in the Second Letter to Timothy, \"If we are unfaithful to him, he will not cease being faithful, since he cannot deny himself.\" 28 Nor must one believe that this good god has the power to destroy himself, and to commit all kinds of wickedness against wisdom and justice. That is even more impossible for him, since he is not the absolute cause of evil. And if one objects to us, saying, \"We have the right to say that the true lord god is all powerful, and not only because he can do and does all the good things, but also because he could do all the wicked things, if he wanted to, even to lie and destroy himself, if he cared to. But he does not want to,\" the answer to them is easy. THAT GOD CANNOT DO EVIL If god does not want to do all the wicked things, if he does not want to lie or destroy himself, surely he cannot. Because what god in his unity does not want to do, he cannot do. And what he cannot do, he does not want to do. And in this sense, one must say that the power of sinning and of doing evil does not belong to the true lord god. All that is thought to be god's attributes and conduct is not accidental, as the learned know. It necessarily follows, 25. Wisdom of Solomon 1:13. 26.

The good god can- not lie or commit every kind of evil, if he wants to, because this true god can- not do what he does not want to, we repeat, since he himself and his will are one and the same. THAT GOD CANNOT CREATE ANOTHER GOD I can say again, very reasonably and without fear of deceiving myself, that the true god, with all his power, cannot, nor ever could, nor ever will, neither will- fully or involuntarily, nor by any other means, create another god, lord, and creator resembling and equal to himself in any way. I prove that it is impossi- ble for the good god to be able to make another god like himself with regard to every quality: the eternal and sempiternal, the creator and author of all his goodness, without beginning or end, the one who was never made or created or engendered. But in the holy scriptures it does not say that the true god is a weak god. One must believe with assurance that the good god is not endowed with omnipotence because he would then be able to or might commit all the evils that have been, that are, and that will be, but because he is truly all pow- erful concerning the good that has been, that is, and that will be. Moreover, he is the absolute and principle cause of all the good, and he is never, in any way, by himself and essentially, the cause of evil. It follows that the true god is called all powerful by the sages, in everything he does, has done, or will do in the fu- ture, but that those who think accurately cannot call him all powerful with re- gard to his supposed power that he might have to exert and that he has never exerted, that he never will exert, with regard to creating a god of evil. As for the argument that says that if he does not do it, it is because he does not want to, we have already shown that such a track is meaningless, since he, himself, and his will are only one. THAT GOD DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO BE EVIL AND THAT THERE EXISTS A FORCE THAT IS EVIL Since god is not powerful in evil, nor has the power to appear to be evil, we must believe firmly that there is another principle, which is he who is power- ful in evil. From him come all evils that have been, that are, and that will be.

The ones on the side of the road are those who heard. Then comes the devil, who takes away the word from their heart so they will not believe and be saved. 31 The prophet Daniel says, \"As I looked, this horn from the fourth beast made war with the holy ones and was prevailing over them, until the ancient one came; then judgment was given for the holy ones of the most high.\" 32 And he says further, \"As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom ten kings will arise, and another will arise after them.\" 33 And then, \"But from one of those four horns a small one emerged, which began to grow toward the south and then toward the east, and then toward the glorious land. He raised his great horn toward the armies of the sky, and it cast down some of the armies and some of the stars to the ground and trampled them down.\" 34 We read in the Apocalypse of Saint John: And another portent was seen in the sky, look, a great fire-red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems.

That is what the holy virgin says in the Gospel of Luke: He has toppled monarchs from their thrones and raised the poor to their feet. 43 And the messenger in the First Letter to the Corinthians tells us, \"Then comes the end when he hands over the kingdom to god the father, after he has destroyed every rule and every authority and power.

It is unknown not because gnosticism sprang from JL. nowhere and nothing. Indeed, we know approximately when and where this dualistic movement of a god of light spirit and a god of dark mat- ter began in antiquity, and also the names of the possible sources. But there are deeply conflicting theses, ancient and modern, about the relevance of these sources to the origin of the widespread and enduring global sect. The story of the origin of most of the world's spiritual movements—Daoism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and Judaism—is blurred in possibil- ity, and reaches us more as legend than history. Even highly documented early Christianity, born of two essential Jewish scriptures, the Old and New Testaments, is steeped in the legends of the New Testament gospels, its core source, that disguise rather than reveal historical probability. So the word is still out on gnosticism. It has backers who speak of elements of Jewish, Chris- tian, Zoroastrian, Buddhist, platonic, Alexandrian neoplatonic, and Egyptian hermetic ancestry. Is there one or are there multiple progenitors of gnosticism? While many favor a multiple-source thesis, the diverse appearances of gnostic thought in the Near East and Alexandria have enough commonality to suggest a unifying spirit in the air, transcending sect, language, and geography. Two singular ideas separate the dualistic gnostics from the old Greco-Roman theologies, Ju- daism, and emerging Christianity: (1) an assumption of two divinities finding their way into us—one of spirit and eternal light, the other of darkness and"},{"pageNumber":775,"pageContent":"y66 EPILOGUE temporal body; and (2) a transcendent principle of light that may be found during one's lifetime, in a flash of gnosis, bringing divinity into one's solitude. In gnosticism, salvation, as the flash of gnosis, may be achieved now and not only as a reward after death, as in Christianity. Christian salvation—un- seeable, untestifiable, unexperienced by humans—is uniquely associated with an afterlife. Its elusive nature gave rise to those great organized clergies who claimed possession of a knowledge of salvation through their interpretation of scripture that usually they alone could read. The gnostic can go it alone, without clergy, and arrive now. In this sense the pervasive ideas of Plato and the neoplatonists, who offer us metaphors and allegories of immediate mysti- cal salvation, seems to be the common stuff that links all the diverse eruptions of gnosticism. Gnosis, meaning \"knowledge,\" becomes the quest of those competing sects, deriving from diverse sources, who have been called the gnostics. When, through Plato, Socrates declares, \"Know yourself,\" 1 one tenet of gnosticism was born. But much earlier, in the Hebrew Bible, Eve chose the fruit of gnosis from the tree and is treated thereafter—as is woman—as the flawed, outsider heretic in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic family of religions. Conversely, among the gnostics she is praised for her courage to choose knowledge rather than innocence (ignorance) and to defy the authority of the creator god of earth and people, who guards knowledge as his own. Eve is the hero of the light and the Promethean liberator from god's tyrannical authority. In Genesis and in later gnostic myth (such as the Origin of the World and the Reality of the Rulers), Eve is the mythical mother of gnosticism. In Mesopotamia and along the Mediterranean, all the way from Alexan- dria to Rome, from about 200 BCE to 200 CE, we witness a rich ferment of spiritual movements, all seeking answers to the enigmas of existence. This is the intertestamental period, in which appear most of the noncanonical apoc- rypha and pseudepigrapha, the Dead Sea Scrolls of the Essenes and the Cor- pus Hermeticum of Egypt. In this period of the mystery religion, messianic charismatic, philosopher, theologian, and mystic also fashioned those sys- tems of wisdom sayings, doctrines, and myth, often recorded on scrolls, that have been classified as gnostic scripture. But until the twentieth century this gnostic scripture survived only as disparate fragments in Greek, Latin, Syriac, 1.

For many generations of scholars and seekers, knowledge of gnosticism came primarily from the works of early church fathers, whose writings, even when fairly reli- able in terms of stating gnostic tenets, were composed as fiercely unsympa- thetic refutations of gnosticism. Then in 1945 in the sands of Egypt was found the Nag Hammadi library, consisting of the great treasure of fourth- century translations into Coptic of earlier Greek texts. These fifty-plus docu- ments constitute a bible of classical gnosticism. Among modern scholars who have had their say about gnostic parentage, Bentley Layton, in The Gnostic Scriptures, sensibly sees gnosticism rooted pri- marily in classical Sethian philosophers, but he also speaks of the gnostic presence in the Greek-speaking synagogues and in early Christianity (notably in Simon Magus, Acts 8:9-12). The leading scholar of Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah, Gershom Sholem, looks to a Jewish origin of gnostic notions in his Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition, and his near contemporary, Hans Jonas (gnosticism's first major interpreter), asserts that gnosticism began in radical circles in Samaria. The Italian historian Giovanni Filoramo notes that \"many scholars propose a Jewish origin for Gnosticism,\" and that the Nag Hammadi gnostic texts confirm a Jewish influence, yet he finds the whole Jewish thesis shaky, for lack of corroborating scripture. 2 Yet some major corroborating scriptures strengthen a Jewish thesis of origin: the Book of Baruch of Justin, the Secret Book of John, and parts of the Gospel of John. The Book of Baruch is primarily a Jewish-gnostic text (Baruch is an angel of Elohim), with Christian and pagan main characters, including Moses, Jesus, and Hercules. It may be that Baruch in its earliest form was a purely Jewish scripture, and the extraordinary work we have now is a some- what Christianized version redacted during the Christian-Jewish period. Even the Christianizing effort is tentative, since its ecumenical editors have gener- ously acknowledged the pagan origins of gnosticism by bringing the god Hercules into the cast.

The church fathers \"simply traced back the rise of Gnosis to the devil.\" 3 The gnostics returned the favor by making the god of the Old and New Testaments the demiurge—or more bluntly, the devil. Not all the church fathers' polemics against the gnostics were uninformed, however. The Alexandrian fathers Clement (d. 215?) and Origen (i85?-254?) were well informed and, to counter the readings of the Valentinian school of biblical scripture, developed their own hermeneutics, which were based on an allegorical reading of scripture. Tertullian was called \"the Christian gnostic,\" since he was said to have found the true gnosis while the gnostics propounded false gnosis. Clement's student Origen, the most prolific theologian before Augustine, edited the Hexapla Bible and developed a threefold reading of scripture: literally, ethically, and allegorically. Imitating the gnostics in looking for esoteric meanings in scripture, he developed an exegesis of the Bible that would find approval in the church. Origen was also linked to gnosticism by his elevation of knowledge over mere faith. But what most enraged early Christians about the gnostics was not only their unsympathetic portrait of the traditional creator god and the rivalry for dominion in this emerging religion—there were many serious heretical rival sects posing threats to primitive Christianity—but their rejection of the es- sential creed that in Jesus there existed two natures: the human and the divine. For the orthodox, Christ was at once man and god, and after suffering on the cross he was resurrected and ascended as the son of god to heaven. The gnostics denied Christ's two natures of human and divine, and la- beled his human semblance merely that—a semblance, not a reality. For them Jesus was a celestial body incapable of human misery. They shared the second-century docetic belief that during his life on earth, Christ was a di- vine phantom, who only seemed to inhabit a human body and to die on the cross. 4 Since Jesus Christ did not die a human death or a divine death, his resurrection and ascension to heaven never took place. Likewise, his lifetime ministries, miracles, and suffering were mere appearances. In the Nag Ham- madi library's First Apocalypse of James, the exalted Christ straightens out a commiserating James after his crucifixion: \"I am the one who was in me. Never have I experienced any kind of suffering.\" 5 As for those who thought 3. Rudolph, Gnosis, 275. 4.

These rejectionist ideas were an anathema to the church, and the gnostics and docetists were examined at length and denounced for their terrible heresies by Irenaeus of Lyon, the bishop Ignatius of Antioch, and Hippolytus and Clement of Alexandria. 7 Later the gnostics were condemned by Augustine, who knew gnosticism from the inside, since he had been a fer- vent Manichaean in his youth. The church fathers were concerned. Here we have the earthly Jewish mes- siah of Isaiah, who in the gospels becomes salvific Jesus, turned by the gnostics into a divinity who resembles an angel but is neither man nor god. And above Jesus is the gnostic god of light at odds with his rival, the ignorant god of the Bible. The creator god of the Bible has earned his title of darkness by creating man and woman as a prison containing the divine particles of light that fell from the pleroma, the fullness (the highest principle in the gnostic theogony). While the biblical god made light, that external light is a temporal illusion. True light is in the human spirit. The gnostic earned the title of illumination by seeking the inner light. And to know and become these particles of light though gnosis is to disappear into eternity. Clearly, the gnostics were heretics. They could become light or god—or whatever one calls the divine principle— in their own person, and without need of the angry church that saw them as evil and would eventually annihilate them. THE JEWISH MOMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF GNOSTICISM One of the intriguing hypotheses about why and how gnosticism developed remains the earlier-noted Jewish one as described by Scholem and Grant. Grant suggests that the earliest gnostics operated in the first century before 6. The Second Treatise of the Great Seth, Codex VII, 2, 56 (NagHammadi Library, 3d ed., P-365). 7. The question of whether Jesus had two natures (human and divine) or one (divine) divided orthodox Christians and divergent sects for more than a thousand years. For example, in the sixth century the Byzantine emperor Justinian wavered, giving some leeway to the Mono- physites, who taught that Jesus Christ was only divine. There were many sects who insisted on the docetic or monophysistic creed that Christ had only a divine nature, from the early Mon- tanists, gnostics, and docetists to the tenth- and eleventh-century Bogomils in Constantinople and Bosnia, and their later Cathar adherents in northern Italy and southwestern France."},{"pageNumber":779,"pageContent":"770 EPILOGUE the common era as a turn elsewhere or inward by Jews disappointed that their foretold messiah had not come. But there were messianic figures who did come to parts of Israel, were not as radical as Jesus, or at least as Jesus' inter- preters created and made him, and whose lives were recorded in historical de- tail, which Jesus, outside the gospels, was not. In the Mishnah and the Talmud we find numerous examples of religious figures operating beyond the fold of the main Jewish sects. Rebellious Galilee had produced not only Jesus but Ha- sidic messianic figures contemporary with Jesus, of whom the two outstand- ing healers and miracle makers were Honi and Hanina. Probably Jesus himself was a Hasidic messianic, as Geza Vermes suggests in The Changing Faces of Jesus, but these charismatics were extrinsic, as apparently was Jesus, to the tra- ditional religious parties. 8 In this period of change and anxious searching for messianic figures of spiritual enlightenment, the gnostics added their message of personal salvation. Incidentally, it must be remembered that the faces of Judaism, like that of the rabbi Jesus, were also changing and multiple. They changed again with each new interpreter, and their scriptures changed according to the eyes of each interpreter. Among those changing faces, whom Scholem, Grant, and others describe, were the Jewish gnostics who, as noted, were to give us the earliest extant gnostic scripture, the Book of Baruch. THE JEWISH BOOK OF BARUCH Gnosticism's main Christian speculations were preceded by heterodox Ju- daism and early Jewish-Christian gnostic systems. Of the latter, Irenaeus de- clares the oldest to be the three doctrines of Simon Magus, Menander, and Saturninus. They reject the god of the Bible as the creator of the world, which they say was the work of angels. The Book of Baruch attributed to Justin, pre- served only as a paraphrase in Hippolytus's Refutation of All Heresies, repre- sents one of the earliest stages of gnostic evolution. Grant calls it \"an example of a gnosis almost purely Jewish ... which owes its origin to three principles, two male and one female.\" 9 It contains a fascinating mixture of traditions, in which the first male is hellenic Priapos, father of the cosmos, while Jewish Elohim is father of this world and a lover of Edem (Eden), the female princi- ple.

When gnosticism embraced Jesus in various guises— messiah, angel, and god—their docetic Jesus was interpreted as a gnostic figure just as the Gospels of John and of Thomas became central to the gnostic canon. 9.

Naas, the serpent, is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the chief maternal angel. Eden is many: garden, earth, Israel, a symbol of Eve, and the earth mother. In later speculations the unknown god in his various guises has a male and female element and is called the mother-father of us all, or god with a female principle or emanation. The female emanation is usually Sophia, who is wisdom. Because of a disturbance and inadequacy in god, she is separated from him, falls from the pleroma, and creates the world. In refer- ring back to Christian gnosticism's Jewish origin and early ties between gnos- ticism and early and late Kabbalah, Grant observes that Justin's variation of Judaism \"is like the mystical Judaism we find in the [medieval Spanish] Zohar, where Yahweh is called the father and Elohim the mother.\" 10 DESPAIR AND TURN TO LIGHT The calamitous Roman occupation of Israel surely influenced the Jewish turn to gnosticism. After the failure of the Jewish rebellion in Jerusalem (66-70 CE), the misery of the Jews increased with the destruction of the Second Tem- ple (70 CE). The utter failure of god to intervene on their behalf dashed their apocalyptic hopes for external help and opened a way to gnosticism. Grant describes the mess of destruction and despair: \"For all practical purposes, the Gnostics must have been ex-Jews, renegades from their religion, for they had abandoned the deity of the Creator.\" 11 While the destruction of the Temple and the city of Jerusalem devastated and exiled the Jews, the later Christian Jews who composed the gospels turned that historic horror into a punishment for those Jews who failed to recognize their messiah and a reward and hope for those who did. In reality both Jews and Christian Jews were slaughtered and driven out of the razed city. This diaspora led to the spread of both gnosticism and Christianity. With Christian Judaism now in the gentile world, the new sect's laws of the Sabbath, circumcision, and diet were quickly altered, making large-scale conversion to Christianity a popular possibility. At the same time the original persecution and calamity, having been experienced equally by Jew and Christian Jew, led many to a gnostic solution, which is seen in the sudden eruption of gnosticism in all the new Christian terrains. Rather then pinning hope on clergy and traditional places of worship, these heterodox Jews as well as Christian Jews chose to look for a light inside. 10. Ibid., 23. 11.

To know that light of being signifies escape from temporal and bodily captivity on the material earth and a return to origin, to the precinct of eter- nal light from which the spark of the spirit came. In the religions of the world the escape from ordinary time and matter, through the mind, into an extraordinary dimension of spirit and revelation has come under the label of mysticism. NATURE OF THE MYSTICAL LEAP Mysticism is a phenomenon appearing in many forms, in East and West and in all continents, and each religious sect carries its own terminology to describe it. Sometimes it is regulated by shamans or carried out as a personal hetero- doxy at the fringes of an established religion (Paracelsus, Teresa of Avila, Boehme). Sometimes it is at the heart of the creed itself, which may be said of Buddhism, gnosticism, or ancient Hasidism and later Kabbalah. The mystical instant may be called illumination or extinction through nirvana, or the light following the annihilation of annihilation. The Persian Sufis call it a confer- ence of birds and the Japanese Zen Buddhists satori. The process itself takes on many descriptive metaphors, such as \"the four levels of cognition\" in Plato, \"the negative way\" in Pseudo-Dionysios and John of the Cross, and \"the steps of the ladder\" in Philo and again John of the Cross. Each rung of the ladder may signify darkness, illumination, and union that is an ineffable ecstasy of oblivion. These various steps usually suggest a cosmic ascent from sensations of the body through the soul to the light and loss of earthly consciousness. The ascender dies from ordinary time on the way to the source of spirit. Then the major question is with what or with whom is the union. With god? A panthe- istic all? A Buddhist void? A Plotinian One? A gnostic particle of light? But per- haps the most obscure question in mysticism is the nature of that union. The two essential but discrete types of union are the monistic and the theistic. If god is postulated as the universal principle to be reached at the end of as- cent, then the monistic mystic seeks identity with god and total immersion in god, while the theistic mystic seeks a communion with or adhesion to god, but no loss of personal identity. In monism subject and object become one; the mystic is absorbed into the deity—Saint Teresa speaks of a drop falling into a 12.

Monism is typically neoplatonic and Christian. John of the Cross (Juan de la Cruz) seeks self-abolition, being lost in god, one with god, and with one identity, god. The most common Christian gnostic articulation of mystical experience is the monistic model, where one moves from initial unknowing (the agnosia of darkness and error, as opposed to gnosis) to full illumination and total union. The notion of being deified, of passing into and becoming the light, is found in Plotinos, whose \"one becomes the One,\" and similarly in the writings attributed to the pagan gnostic Hermes Trismegistos. In Hermes the soul rises on an ascending scale of mental states though the spheres. Hans Jonas de- scribes the journey of the self, while still in the body, which \"attains the Ab- solute as an immanent, if temporary condition.\" In that instant there is a translation \"of objective stages into subjective phrases whose culmination has the form of ecstasis, gnostic myth has passed into mysticism (neoplatonic and monastic), and in this new medium it [the attainment of the Absolute] lives on long after the disappearance of the original mythological beliefs.\" 13 By contrast with platonist mystical fusion and oneness, Martin Buber in I and Thou rejects the monistic notion of \"I am god.\" For the theist the notion of becoming the godhead is shameful and deprives the creator of independ- ent existence. Theistic mysticism—characteristic of the Bible, Jewish gnosti- cism, the Kabbalist Zohar, and a majority of postmedieval seekers—holds to an ultimate separation of the human and the divine. As Scholem states, the Jewish mystic \"retains a sense of distance between the Creator and His crea- ture.\" 14 This dualism of person and god is frequently symbolized in the merkabah, the divine throne-chariot that carries the soul skyward to god, which is illuminated by god's presence but does not disappear into and be- come god. There is the ascent, adhesion but not the fusion. The divine chariot draws its inspiration from Ezekiel 1:10 and provides the metaphor at the origins of Jewish mysticism. In the Dead Sea Scrolls is a strik- ing picture of cherubim blessing the chariot as it ascends, with its cargo of spirit, near god in his precincts. In reading this description of the cherubim and the merkavah, note that a cherub (a little angel) in the Jewish tradition would not resemble the sentimentalized plump children in Raphael's Sistine Madonna but perhaps a multi-faced Picasso grotesque, since the model in Ezekiel for cherubim and seraphim flitting about in god's court has four faces and four wings: 13.

And between the turning wheels, angels of holiness come and go, as it were a fiery vision of most holy spirits; and about them flow seeming rivulets of fire, like gleaming bronze, a radiance of many gorgeous colors, of mar- velous pigments magnificently mingled. 15 The theistic tradition of Jewish ascension goes from its biblical sources, through the Jewish gnostics and the ancient and medieval Kabbalists, to modern interpreters who visit god but do so, as once the biblical Enoch made that ascent, without losing his person and spirit. In the sixteenth cen- tury this way continues in the work of the Spanish mystical poet Luis de Leon (1527/8-91). An Augustinian monk of New Christian (converso) origin, whose great-grandmother Leonor de Villanueva was burned to death in an auto-da-fe in 1512, Leon chose musical and celestial metaphors to reveal the soul's adhesion to god. But there is no immersion in the deity's blinding light. As the chariot pierces the highest sphere, the soul still hears and feels as it passes into oblivion and peace. It retains its human qualities as it comes into the presence of its divine maker: Here the soul sails around inside a sea of sweetness, and finally wheels about and then is drowned so that it hears or feels nothing that foreign accident reveals. O happy deep collapse! O death conferring life! O sweet oblivion! ASCENSION DURING ONE'S LIFE TO THE ETERNAL The gnostics developed their own lexicon to map the experience of self- knowledge, which drew on the philosophical speech of Alexandrian platon- ism as well as the mythologies of the Bible and of classical Greek and 15.

From these sources they formed their own cosmogony (creation of the world) and theogony (creation of the gods) and their fantas- tic symbolic legends. While confined to the earth, the gnostics believed, each human being consists of a vital trinity of material body, temporal soul, and eternal spirit. Within that physical and mental trinity, one is free to ascend from body and soul to eternal spirit, even before death, from darkness to the freedom of full illumination. These powerful, radical ideas opened interior ways of endless possibility. Nothing is all new, yet the specific articulation of gnosticism was a new, alluring alternative to the normative religion that locked ideas into dogma, bureaucracy, and worldly power to defeat infidels and banish cre- ative solitude. The attractive equation of knowledge, light, spirit, and god was at the heart of gnosticism as it developed in differing modes all over the ancient world. Around the time of the crucifixion, gnosticism rose in the Near East, Egypt, and the European Roman Empire. In this turbulent period of dias- pora, dispirit, intense speculation, and self-proclaimed prophets and messi- ahs, the gnostics chose the meditative gaze. Their dualism was not only of two conflicting gods but of external flesh and internal spirit, and these two human attributes lived in absolute separation. There is nothing new about the Cartesian split of mind and matter, but in the instance of the gnostics mind is all and the rest an encumbrance. The body is matter. Their turn from the body is not Asian asceticism or flesh-loathing puritanism. It is simply that mind is the only reality that can turn into light. In this sense we see how close the gnostics are to Plotinian immersion in the all, the sun, the good, where all the rest is illusion. In gnosticism (which Plotinos derided) the as- cent is inward to the fullness, to a glimpse of and participation in the light of the pleroma. Other than the jargon and metaphor, there is little difference in the mystical leap to immediate salvation in gnosticism and the Plotinian way. Both offer salvation now in one's life, in contrast to the three orthodox Abra- hamic religions, which hold out some form of salvation as a reward after death. The Kabbalist and Christian mystics, who have operated on the bor- ders of heresy, also report ascension and adhesion to or immersion in god, and their voyage is immediate and presumably outside time. The meaning of their experience differs specifically from that of the gnostic, however, in that their communion or union with god is not consummated as a confirmation of eternal salvation—all that must occur as a reward in the afterlife—while the gnostic does find eternal salvation in the now, which even later death will"},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"776 EPILOGUE not erase. 16 While this is not usually recognized, gnostic salvation now makes mortality not only secondary but also, as in the Judaism of the Torah, final, with no probability of afterlife or heaven. For the Torah-based Jews, however, reward is closeness to god and a good, virtuous, long life on earth; for the gnostics it is a flash of disappearance of the spirit from body and earth to re- turn to the original light source, to become that light source or god or what- ever name one attaches to the most significant creative principle, and then to return to earth, body and soul, consoled by the knowledge of that glimpse and participation. JEWISH, CHRISTIAN, AND GNOSTIC GODS In Judaism god is the principle force, and Satan (meaning \"adversary\") is a scarcely mentioned member of god's court (Job 1-2 and Zechariah 3:1-2). He is god's enforcer among humans, and only in 1 Chronicles 21:1 is there ambi- guity as to whether he is an adversary of god or of humans. In this one in- stance of possible evil and opposition, he is at worst a minor digression. Judaism is not dualistic with regard to divine powers, and apart from the early rival Canaanite gods of the Torah, god has no rival within the ranks of Jewish divinities. Probably through the influence of Persian (Zoroastrian) dualism, Christianity drove Satan out of heaven into the underworld but gave him only limited powers. Satan and his demons caused physical and mental sicknesses and were a pervasive temptation, but wicked Satan never tasted the omnipotence of god. His inferno was not another great firmament, a site not of cosmic creation but of punishment. In fact Satan himself was usually a prisoner in his own realm, in Apocalypse fire or Dante's ice, and no match for the magnificent Almighty of Jews and Christians, whose Hebrew Bible name, El Shaddai, \"god of the mountains\" or \"god the bountiful,\" re- sounds his grandeur. 17 In contrast to the feeble Satan of Judaism and the fearful devil of the later Christians comes the gnostic demiurge, who is no other than the great and 16. After distinguishing between spiritual leaps of the gnostic and others, we may note that these are descriptive, not evaluative, distinctions. The lives and poems of the sixteenth-century Spanish mystics Fray Luis de Leon and San Juan de la Cruz (Saint John of the Cross) have been and remain a lifelong summit. 17.

While the creator god loses virtue, he remains almighty, for it is he who created the world. With his command \"Let there be light\" (the light of illusion), Eve and Adam were trapped on earth, and god becomes the war- den of their human spirit. By these shifts of power and province, the attributes of the Judeo-Christ- ian god are divided between the two polar gods. There is the god of spirit, whose attributes are light and knowledge, and the god of matter, whose at- tributes are darkness and error. In varying texts, from China to western Eu- rope, Yahweh takes on nasty and fearful-sounding names, such as Yaldabaoth, Sakla, and Samael. Like fallen Lucifer, he is the boss and patron of evil, whose main business occurs on his creations, the earth under its revolving sun star. Replacing the creator god of illusion at the top is the interior god of light whose domain is everywhere there is mind. The earth-bound are not pure matter and darkness, which should be seen as impediments to transcendence, but also particles of light, which are reached not through the church or the outer firmament but through meditation. The inner god of light represents the hope of return. Clearly, the gnostics turned Judeo-Christian theology upside down. They had the audacity to make Yahweh into a vain creator of the earth and its imprisoned inhabitants and, in many scriptures, simply into the devil. This extreme turnaround must be understood in the historic complexity of gnos- tic rivalry with Christian orthodoxy and the need of each sect to hide its an- cestry. The earliest Christians were Jews. Yet in slipping away from Judaism, Christianity demonized the Jews. So in John 8:44 we have Jesus, a rabbi, ad- dressing the Jews, saying, \"You are from your father the devil.\" Developing Christianity essentially deconstructs Judaism, diminishing all, from its Torah to its \"temporal\" god. And though it debases the Jews, speaking of their prophets \"whom they murdered\" and their god of wrath and revenge as op- posed to the New Testament god of love and mercy, it must denounce the Jew- ish god in a confused fashion, since without a scripture of their own, the early Christian Jews and Christian gentiles of the first and second centuries de- pended on the Jewish Bible as their own book, as a book that foretells the com- ing of the Christian messiah. Ultimately, that Jewish earthly messiah will be in the name of Jesus Christ (Yeshua Mashiah), the foremost god, the immediate 18.

While in the gospels Jesus will sit to the right of god's throne, in popular thought and iconography god and salvation are more understood through Jesus. The tripartite nature of god explains away this pop- ular misunderstanding, but the perception persists that Jesus is not only god but also, for all practical purposes, the immediate god to address in prayer. If the Christian god must share his realm of significance with Jesus and to a much lesser extent with the holy spirit, then the gnostics carry sectarian ri- valry with an ancestral father religion in the Hebrew Bible radically further. The gnostics deconstruct both Judaism and Christianity and reconstitute them both to conform to their own creation myths. In both Christian and gnos- tic reconstruction of precursors, however, these ritual killings of the found- ing father contain astonishing inconsistencies. The Christians demonize the Jews but exempt all the early Christians, who were also Jews, by ignoring or dissembling their religious identity as Jews. While the gnostics demonize the original god of the Jews, they pay less attention to the Jews themselves, who are seldom mentioned—though they are not well treated when they are mentioned. Classical gnosticism sees the creator god of the Bible not only as the god of the Jews but principally as the demiurgical tyrant of misguided Christians, who have appropriated and interpreted the Hebrew Bible as their own Christian Bible. And insofar as Christians worship that biblical god, they also obey the demon of darkness. But the misguided Christians have a way out. They can become true Christians if, as Christian gnostics, they renounce the god of the Bible and turn to the invisible father of all. JESUS AMONG THE GNOSTICS How does Jesus fit into this revisionism? Among the Christian gnostics, Jesus is the mediating figure. He is often the envoy (or angel) of the invisible true fa- ther. This position makes him higher than a human, less than the godhead. He is normally monophysitic, which is to say that he is only spirit and his body on earth is illusion. He has no human body but only appears to have died on the cross. In his highest position as envoy, he appears as an eternal being (an aeon) sent to earth to instruct humans in the ways of light and redemption. While the Christian gnostics, including the later Cathars, claim that their Jesus is the true Jesus, he is so different from the Jesus of orthodox Rome and Byzantium as to make his gnostic articulation impossible for Christians to ac- cept. On at least two major issues there could be no compromise. Christianity"},{"pageNumber":788,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE 779 had already thrashed out the docetist notion of the phantom Christ with more than a dozen other early sects. The docetist heresy would take the humanity, the generous suffering, and the miracle from the gospel Jesus. Jesus has to be both man and god, and not an apparent man-god. Secondly, and equally im- portant, in gnosticism Jesus does not hold that strange relation of being both son of god and, surely in popular perception, god himself. For the gnostics Jesus is only one of the divine emanations of the invisible father of all, and not near the top of the hierarchy in the pleroma. The Greek word for angel is an- gelos, a translation of the Hebrew maVach, meaning \"messenger\" or \"envoy\" and originally applied to Hermes, the messenger of the gods. In gnosticism Jesus is frequently referred to as a mere angel (messenger) of god, and this low station is counter to basic Christian doctrine. In Christianity, as said, the Jew- ish messiah has become the divine Christ, and Christ or Jesus often replaces god in icon and prayer. So the gnostic Jesus who mocks the clergy for suppos- ing him human, vulnerable to pain, and mortal definitely has no place in the church. PAGAN GNOSTICS There were also classical gnostics who did not derive from Judaism or Chris- tianity. These were the pagan gnostics. Largely in Alexandria, they adapted neoplatonism and local hermetic mystery religion into a new mythical dual- ism in which flesh is dark temporal matter while mind (nous) is knowledge and sunlike. Knowledge will make us better than the gods, for once we have acquired it we are both mortal and immortal. The pagans believed that the great hermetic philosopher is Hermes Trismegistos (the thrice greatest), who sprang from the Egyptian god Thoth and Greek Hermes. In Poimandres (Shepherd), a superb literary tractate attributed to this Hermes, he gives his severely dualistic view of the cosmos, expressed as visionary experience. The demiurge is the maker who originally emanates from the androgynous father of all. The maker makes humans, whom he sets in the prison of the material earth. But an androgynous primal person (anthropos) descends to earth and mingles with the cosmos, offering spiritual promise. He carries in him a spark of holy light. The human creature, by the act of gnosis in his or her life, can rise from the body through interior light to join the light-body of god. Long after the myth of cosmic return to the light principle has disappeared, the technique of spiritual ascent, while alive and in the body, lives on as a later development of neoplatonic and Christian mysticism. In addition to the"},{"pageNumber":789,"pageContent":"78o EPILOGUE ascension to the interior sun in Plotinos (205-70), there is an outstanding ex- ample of early Christian ascension in the super-luminous gloom and ray of blackness of the Syrian Pseudo-Dionysios (6th c.?). The first a philosopher, the second a church theologian, each used a different lexicon to translate the phe- nomenon, but the experience of the ecstatic and of mystical ascension, whether among gnostics, Jews, Christians, or Muslims (and most of the rest of the world, including the shamans of most continents) is a universal commonplace. ZOROASTRIANISM, A PRECURSOR OF GNOSTICISM Among these diverse sources of gnosticism, Iranian Zoroastrianism (Maz- daism) had a paramount influence in eastern gnosticism. While it did not di- rectly reach the earlier Syrian-Egyptian gnostics, Zoroastrian structure and notions of salvation profoundly affected third-century Mani and Manichaeism. Led by Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian good spirits (ahuras) contend against dark evil spirits (daevas or divs), led by Ahriman, for the fate of the human soul. The people of light are pitted against the people of darkness. When Mazda (meaning \"wise\") wins, the soul ascends to the realm of light. Particu- larly during the sixth-century BCE Babylonian captivity, when Jews were in a region where Zoroastrianism was practiced, this dualistic religion also af- fected Judaism. There is obviously a coincidence of idea and word in the Es- senes of The Manual of Discipline, with their sons of light warring against the sons of darkness. The Iranian dualism coincides with the essential character of the gnostic speculation, which emerges as a system of antinomies. GNOSTICS AS DANGEROUS HERETICS The majority of gnostics saw themselves as the enlightened Christians, at least in the first periods of their growth. By the end of the second century of the common era, while traditional Christianity was becoming a powerful inde- pendent religion, the gnostics were converting and spreading in great numbers and across many borders of Asia, Africa, and Europe. To convert traditional Christians to their intelligence, the gnostic philosophers developed an allegor- ical exegesis of the gospels to prove that Christian gospel revealed gnostic truths. They produced the first theological Christian literature, and in the sec- ond century their writings were apparently significantly more extensive than"},{"pageNumber":790,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE 7 8l those of the Catholic and Orthodox churches. 19 Their favored text to com- ment on was the Gospel of John (see Herakleon), which they treated as their gospel. In the first lines of the Gospel, John establishes the notion of the essen- tial interior light and tells the role of John the baptizer: He was not the light. but came to testify about the light. The light was the true light which illuminates every person who comes into the world. (John 1:8-9) John the baptizer was not the light, meaning that Jesus was the light and John merely the lamp carrying the light. So John's role is defined as prophetic but secondary to that of Jesus, who is the divine. All this suggests intense ri- valry between early followers of a messiah, some favoring John, who electri- fied Judaism with his arrival as a human messiah in ways seemingly foretold in Isaiah (Isaiah 7:14, 9:2-7, 42:1-4), others, the majority, favoring Jesus as a divine messiah. There is considerable evidence that by the second century the number of those favoring John—apart from the gnostics who favored him— was increasing alarmingly. The Mandaean gnostics aggressively chose John the baptizer over Jesus and made Jesus into the so-called Nbu Christ, who is a sorcerer, who fouls baptism and people with menstrual discharge but claims to be the true god. The high clergy in Rome, Antioch, and Constantinople was alarmed. Not only were the gnostics converting newcomers by appropriating the gospels as their own, but they were also converting Christians to their heresy and spread- ing from land to land as an unquenchable fire. These gnostics seemed to turn every sacred notion on its head, from Eve, who could be seen as virtuous for choosing knowledge, to the creator god, who was denigrated as proud, legalis- tic, and ignorant and assigned the lowest demonic place in the cosmic hierar- chy. In those ostensibly Christian schools of the gnostics, especially pernicious were the intellectual and mystical notions of Alexandrian Valentinos (Valenti- nus), Basilides, and the Sethians, which, from at least 135 to 450, were promi- nent. To the initially decentralized networks of the early Christians, these were formidable heretics. These Alexandrians, along with Mani and his followers, 19.

By the end of the fifth century, the heterodox sects were in large part muted. How- ever, as late as Saint Augustine (354-430), the battle of numbers for possession of the Christian heart lingered. An emblem of those times is Augustine's pro- tean persuasions, the gnostic who saw the light of Christianity. Though later he wrote abundantly against the gnostics, early in his career the theologian was a fervently active and roaming gnostic in Italy and North Africa, one who proselytized and preached the message of Manichaeism. His Against Faustus, in which he denounces his former Manichaean master Faustus, is one of many important works, along with those by Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Origen, Epipha- nius, and Tertullian, that summarize and refute the gnostic heresy. For the witnessing Christians, for whom Jesus Christ and God were father and son, and Christ both human and divine, these people of light were dan- gerous hypocrites insofar as they called themselves Christians. The gnostics did not accept the humanity of Jesus (Jesus was a phantom), nor the trinity of father, son, and holy spirit, nor god himself as their god. To the Christians, gnosticism was not only a threat to their dominion but also a negation of the conceptual frame of Christianity. The traditional Christians were also in a pe- riod of anxiety, instability, and danger. Christianity was still at odds with Ju- daism and with imperial Rome, which persecuted it. From Rome to Cappadocia in Anatolia (present-day Turkey), the Christians were living in caves and underground to escape the Roman sword. They lacked a main- stream church (from the start there were internal feuds, as their own begin- ning had been a feud with fellow Jews), and they were struggling to confirm their own doctrine and domain. Above all, the lack of a defined Bible created a scriptural vacuum. There would not be an official selection of books to be included in the New Testament until the Nicaean Council in 325. 20 The He- brew Bible history of the Jews, which they either denied or interpreted as their history, was a scriptural dilemma and a plague to them even till this day. So while the gnostics were creating abundant scripture with extravagant myths that made god the counterfeit creator of the world, the Christians wan- dered in a maze of overlapping apocrypha, epistles, and apocalypses, all com- peting for inclusion in a yet to be determined canon. The Jews were less of a 20. In The First Edition of the New Testament, David Trobisch states that by the middle of the second century the essential New Testament was defined and being copied.

It was odd and surely discomforting that the one established book of the Christians was still the Book of the Jews, whether read in Hebrew, in Septuagint Greek, or in the Old Latin translation. While the Jewish Bible had long been set, New Testament scriptures (written by Christian Jews, about and for Jews) remained in flux, and a Christian Bible, containing Old and New Testaments, was still nearly four centuries away. In response to these many challenges to the church, Christian apologists forcefully rejected \"the abominable writings of the demonic heretics.\" Ironi- cally, in the course of angry refutation, the heresiologists imitated the gnostic philosophers and developed their own Christian exegesis. For its part, gnosti- cism with immense vitality challenged and widely subverted Christian theol- ogy—which had its own divisions—and remained Christianity's most serious rival, even when muted, until the birth of Islam. THE DESTRUCTION OF RIVAL GNOSTICS AND CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION Christianity responded to rivals of their dominion by silencing the gnostics along with the religious and philosophical remnants of the Greco-Roman world. As early as the second century, Christian clerics destroyed gnostic texts, burned meeting places, and went after the pagan arts and philosophers with a fury. But how did the syncretistic hellenistic ethos disappear in the West? The classical Greek civilization of Alexandria had given us Euclid and his princi- ples of geometry, Longinos describing Sappho's religious ecstasy in \"On the Sublime,\" the philosophers Philo and Plotinos keeping platonism alive, and the main schools of classical gnosticism. But after this great flowering, the city's culture was violently shut down. Christians under the command of the Alexandrian patriarch Theophilos of Alexandria (later saint), with approval by the Byzantine emperor Theodosios I, leveled the major temple complex of the Sarapeum in 391. In the Sarapeum was lodged the Mouseion (museum) li- brary, the greatest library of antiquity, holding about 700,000 rolls. After raz- ing the buildings, Theophilos used the temple stone to construct Christian churches. His nephew Bishop Cyril (later saint), attacked Egyptian Christian and hermetic gnostics as heretics, burned synagogues, and drove the Jews out of Alexandria.

All perceived rivals of the church were slaughtered—classical neoplatonists, Christian and pagan gnostics, and Jews, as well as the \"heretical\" orders within the Christian compass. After Constantine, a votary to the pagan sun god, converted to Christianity in 306, the Roman Empire possessed its first Christian monarch. As Emperor Constantine I he continued fighting brutal wars among other self-acclaimed emperors in order to consolidate a greater Rome, whose new center would be Byzantium (later Constantinople). But before Constantine could establish the Eastern Roman Empire in Byzantium he had many civil wars to attend to, the last of which resulted in his victory in 324 over Licinius, a competing claimant to the title of emperor. General Licinius was Constantine's sister's husband and his ally in wars against the other western pretenders to the throne. When there were only two claimants left, Constantine and Licinius, Constantine defeated Licinius in decisive battles at Adrianople and Anatolia, and executed him and his son. When Christianity became the state religion, replacing the Roman gods whose highest deity had been humanly embodied in the emperor, the churches and monasteries ceased being persecuted and thereafter received fa- vors. In 330 Constantine officially moved the center of the empire to the city of Byzantium, which he rebuilt as Constantinople. Despite the triumph of Constantine over the Roman gods, the internal doctrinal disputes in Christianity that had preceded its political triumph never ceased. Apart from the outsider gnostics, whom the Church saw not as Christians but as Satanists, there were the Roman bishops (a disagreement that was to culminate in the great schism of Orthodox Constantinople and Catholic Rome), the Nestorians, the Donatists, and the Arians, among others, who also demonized each other. The Arians under Bishop Arios of Alexandria claimed that Christ was not divine but a created being. To quell dispute, Con- stantine optimistically convened the first ecumenical Council of Nicaea (now Iznik, Turkey) in 325. Despite such accomplishments as the Nicaean Creed, which condemned Arianism and affirmed the equality of the trinitarian son and father, the doctrinal struggles only intensified. The wavering neophyte Constantine was finally baptized on his deathbed by an Arian bishop. During his life in Rome of the East, the emperor took the role of Chris- tianizing his adopted city of Constantinople seriously. Though unbaptized, he 21. For a discussion of Hypatia see Mary R.

Nevertheless, Constantine held together Rome and Constantinople as the twin pillars of the empire. With a Latin-speaking em- peror in Byzantium, the West and East, Rome and Greece, were at last one, po- litically and religiously—at least for a while. With Christianity now the state religion of the Roman Empire, there seemed a chance for religious and political stability in Christendom. The Christians were no longer persecuted by Rome. Rather, a new theocracy set out to combat heretics within the empire, and the war against the gnostics was waged from the top. The long campaign was only partially successful. Hel- lenism was in tatters, the marble Roman gods of the pantheons crushed, and the parent religion Judaism disenfranchised and insignificant, but the faith was still caught up in doctrinal struggles. The foremost enemy remained the great gnostic heresy. The gnostics in Alexandria were early on fiercely perse- cuted by a church tolerated by Rome. When the Roman Empire under Con- stantine became both the political as well as the religious master of the ancient world, the destruction of the \"acosmic heresy\" seemed to be nearly total. Christian clerics burned the writings of the heretics. The light people buried many scrolls of their scripture, which in at least one Egyptian site, at Nag Hammadi, was to be discovered sixteen hundred years later. The gnostics themselves were killed or hounded out of one place but would appear else- where, even in Constantinople nearly a thousand years later as the Slav Bo- gomils, and gnostic speculation would outlast the Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire, and the Byzantine Empire. A few gnostic texts survived, quoted at length in the diatribes of their ac- cusers. But though Alexandria, North Africa, and Syria ceased being gnostic centers, the religion of light persisted in other areas, mainly remote ones: in western China, in pockets of Mesopotamia, and in the Balkans and south- western Europe until well into the fifteenth century.

Gnostic texts were found beginning in the Italian renaissance, but only in the twentieth century did we come upon the equivalent of a Dead Sea Scrolls resurrection with the great find near the town of Nag Hammadi in Egypt, which afforded us texts to comprehend, for the first time, the literatures and thought of the gnostics. Jorge Luis Borges points out that it might not have been this way had history been different, fa- voring a gnostic majority. In an early essay, Borges spoke about the Alexan- drian gnostic Basilides, whose work we still have only in fragmentary and corrupt form as bequeathed to us by his condemners. In \"A Defense of Basilides the False\" Borges writes, \"Had Alexandria triumphed and not Rome, the extravagant and muddled stories that I have summarized here would be coherent, majestic, and perfectly ordinary.\" But Alexandria did not triumph. A philosopher of the knowledge of nonbeing and the abyss, Basilides was one of the most fascinating of the gnostic thinkers, but he is preserved only in the writings of his opponents, and their summaries contra- dict each other on significant points. That his works were not included in the Nag Hammadi library or in other finds is lamentable. Were we to uncover a major original text, on the basis of existing evidence, we would have the writ- ings of an essential ancient philosopher. There is a strange fact of survival. We have abundant texts by two neoplatonist philosophers from Alexan- dria—Philo, a Jew, and Plotinos, a pagan—yet no original text of their fellow Alexandrian philosopher Basilides. This strongly implies that to Christian apologists, the gnostics were held to be more dangerous than the Jews or the classical philosophers. So the gnostic writings of their greatest rival had to be destroyed. It is some comfort that at least their refutations in the works of Christians fathers, such as Irenaeus and Augustine, do exist and inform, if not satisfy, us. A RESURFACING OF GNOSTIC COMMUNITIES With the iconoclastic rage unleashed by Christian orthodoxy in Alexandria, Athens, Rome, and the Eastern Roman Empire against classical antiquity and the gnostic heresy, by the middle of the fifth century even the widespread gnostics began to fade.

Within a century after Mani's death, in about 276, the founder's religion spread throughout the Roman Empire and Asia and was the sturdiest of the gnostic sects. Even after the earlier dismal suppression of other gnostic schools in North Africa and most of Europe, areas of ascetic neomanichaeans survived largely beyond the grasp of pope and emperor or at the outer reaches of their dominion, from Turkestan to Carthage—in Persia, in the Arabic Near East, in western China, and in southern France, where persecution was initially less extreme. These were also the Islamic gnostics in central Asia. And there was the amazing trail of the neomanichaean Paulicians, who from the sixth to the tenth centuries were in Armenia and the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire and who later merged with the neomanichaean Bogomils, who were driven out of Constantinople and persisted in Syria and Armenia; it was Bogomil missionaries who in the eleventh century brought their form of Manichaeism to the Cathars in France. The Manichaeans in Chinese Turfan became the leaders of the state religion of the important Uigur empire in Turkestan, western China (762-840). In its territorial range, in its cultural multiplicity, no religion has been so internationally receptive as has gnosti- cism. Into its diversity of sects and scriptures it incorporated essential figures from the world's major philosophies and religions: Buddha, Plato, Ahura Mazda, Apollo, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. The thirteenth century was tragic for the gnostic speculation, both in the Far and Middle East and in the European West. In Asia it was Genghis Khan's horsemen who from 1218 to 1224 stormed over the gnostics in Chinese Turkestan; in Provence it was Pope Innocent Ill's Albigensian crusade (1209) into southern France that cleansed the \"Manichaean scourge of god\" from the earth. The crusade was followed by a century of the newly formed Inquisition (1231). After another century of murder, torture, seizure of properties, and forced conversion, by the end of the fourteenth century the Cathars (or Albi- gensians), who flourished in the Occitan region in southwest France, were wiped out, their meditation extinct. Only small numbers of Cathar gnostics survive today, making up the Cathar church in parts of France and Canada. They have their own website. There are more Mandaeans (also known as Na- soreans and Christians of Saint John), a largely non-Christian sect that looks back to Babylonia for its astrology and to John the baptizer for his cleanliness rite of immersion.

This fertile, nonascetic religion of the living water is practiced by groups in villages and cities of Iraq and Iran, and some, far from their roots, have migrated to cities in America. 23 RECOVERY OF GNOSTIC SCRIPTURES Gnosticism lives beyond the existence of a contemporary school in a chance Mesopotamian village or city or in assimilated Catharist communities in Mon- treal or Detroit. Principally, it has survived as sacred texts. A gnostic bible has emerged, gradually assembled out of the church fathers' imperfect Greek and Latin refutations, from tombs in Persia and China, from a pot under the sands near the ancient hamlet of Chenoboskion in which was discovered the great Coptic Nag Hammadi library, and also from documents held in the Coptic Museum at Cairo and in the British Museum and Berlin Museum. These are some of the sites where words of gnosticism have been located and stored. Some heresiological literature had survived, but altogether not more than fifty printed pages. But by the end of the Middle Ages the long reconstruction of that gnostic memory was in full swing. A large collection of writings known as the Corpus Hermeticum (or the Hermetica), attributed to Hermes Tris- megistos, was repeatedly copied. The central work of the Hermetica is the Poimandres, a Socratic dialogue between the dark body and the enlightened mind, or nous, whose purpose is the soul's escape and ascent. Cosimo de Medici ordered the Poimandres to be translated into Latin; this appeared in 1471, translated by Marsilio Ficino. In the late eighteenth century the Coptic text Pistis Sophia (Faith Wisdom), going back to the third century, found its way into English libraries. This collection contains interminable gnostic conversa- tions by the risen Jesus with his companions about the fall and redemption of a heavenly aeon Pistis Sophia. In the next hundred years Pistis Sophia was translated into Latin and European languages. In 1896 more came out of Egypt: a Coptic papyrus volume containing the Gospel of Mary, the Secret Book of John, and the Sophia of Jesus Christ. Five songs of a major collection, the Songs of Solomon (or Odes of Solomon), were in the Pistis Sophia. 23. In modern times Mandaeans have moved from villages to medium-sized towns and cities between Baghdad and Basra and in Iran to cities like Ahvaz and Shustar, where ceremonies are attended but knowledge of the old languages and scripts is diminishing."},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE 789 Then in 1909 J. Rendel Harris discovered an old Syriac (Aramaic) manu- script of the Songs of Solomon comprising forty songs (originally forty- two; the first two are missing). These songs, carrying the false attribution to Solomon, are among the most beautiful and profound songs of world religious literature. Another long poem is the Song of the Pearl, contained in the apoc- ryphal Acts of Thomas, a Syriac text that also exists in Greek. It is an extraor- dinary narrative of a prince who seeks a pearl in Egypt, which he finds, thereby bringing the soul from darkness into the kingdom of light. To these we must add, again from Egypt, the Coptic Songbook of Manichaean poems, as well as collections of Mandaean poems, songs, prayers, and narrative cosmologies that first came into Europe through Portuguese monks returning from Asia. Despite these accumulating discoveries, the quilt of gnostic scriptures was thin. Because the destruction of the great ancient libraries and specifically of gnostic sacred texts was so complete, our knowledge of essential ideas of gnos- ticism still had to be detected from Christian writings against them. Then in 1945 in Egypt a farmer discovered near Nag Hammadi a buried cache of thir- teen codices containing some fifty texts, in fourth-century Coptic translation from Greek second- and third-century compositions. After a few decades of hijinks, high adventure, and even the intervention of Carl Jung, these splendid texts were finally translated into French, German, Italian, and English under the title of the Nag Hammadi library. 24 Gnosticism had found a new voice. When the Dead Sea Scrolls were found on the west bank of the Dead Sea in 1947 near Wadi Qumran, suddenly a fringe sect of Essenes, opposed to Jerusalem, had abundant scripture from out of a vase. Similarly the gnostics, a religion on the fringe, but one that had extended from the east coast of China to the west coast of Portugal, came, after being concealed because of critical danger, into light. These two instants of discovery were supreme in the resur- rection of an apparently extinguished body of thought. GNOSTIC STORIES AND TERMINOLOGY Most of the gnostic texts have an engaging literary clarity. In these, abstraction yields to striking metaphor. One example is the unsurpassed allegorical ad- venture in the Song of the Pearl, or the divine orgy in the Origin of the World."},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"790 EPILOGUE In the latter, the romping creator god holds dominion over Eden as he chases and rapes the virgin Eve, who represents courage, defiance, and knowledge; as a result of an abominable gang rape by the creator god and his angelic aids, Eve begets generations of trapped demigod souls, who are our ancestors. But after the fiercely discrediting deeds by the demiurge, the mountains of the first father will blaze and fire will turn on its maker, who will burn inside the forests. Then \"light will cover darkness.\" There are constants to these wild tales that slip in allegorically or emerge in plain description: a radical and alien stance to traditional creed; a mystical encounter with invisible spirit; and a flight from initial ignorance and darkness to silent freedom and light. Other tales fare less well in transcription. Confusion is inevitable with so many schools, conflicting symbolism, and variation of a mythic story. Con- sider the common theme of the fall and enslavement of the soul in the body's prison and its longing for return to its source. What is that holy source? It has a babel of names: the androgynous god of light, god the father/god the mother, the Sethian unknowable god, the Valentinian father of truth, the Manichaean original light, the abyss of nonbeing that in Basilides means the demiurge. Often there is a mishmash of hierarchical names, titles, and ab- stractions, where the author appears seduced by the glory of language to the detriment of meaning (and delight of scholars) as in a fascinating scripture called the Foreigner (Allogenes in Greek and Coptic). In this adventure the foreigner goes off on a platonic journey and ascent to salvation. He is aided by divine figures who generate other crucial helpers: the aeon of Barbelo and her triadic emanation of Kalyptos, Protophanes, and Au- togenes. They prepare him with wings of internal ascent for the coming vi- sions when his liberated soul will merge joyfully with the unknowable god of light. The Foreigner is a complex tale of metaphysical acrobatics and meta-re- alities, a far cry from the apocalyptic journey in Revelation with its beasts from the sea, splashes of angels, and jeweled decorations of heaven. Deprived of the high rhetoric of Revelation or Daniel, this flight to joyful extinction fal- ters in turgid overload of abstract exclamations. The worthy thought is not al- ways matched by dramatic means. Here it is appropriate to acknowledge the terminological problems in reading gnostic texts, complicated not only by the diversity of sects but the multiple ways these terms are translated into English and other languages. Mandaean texts demand a glossary of terms just to decipher the main figures and concepts, beginning with Anosh or Enosh for \"man\" and Kushta for \"truth.\" Perhaps this diversity is inevitable and right for a religion that fed on"},{"pageNumber":800,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE 791 freedom from conventional stricture and had a flair for inventing myth to verbalize withdrawal and meditative flight. Even the current term gnosticism (a fine umbrella term, today under fire) is largely, but not entirely, an eigh- teenth-century invention for the ancient dualistic critique of the world. For the polemical church fathers, the label \"heretics,\" as in Irenaeus's Adversus haereses, was commonly sufficient. Yet even Irenaeus was acutely aware that gnosis was intrinsic to this group that dared to tamper with Christian monotheism. The bishop's longer title for his attack reads On the Exposure and Refutation of their Falsely Called Gnosis. GNOSTIC DESPAIR AND INNER LIGHT, AND THE EMERGENCE OF A SELF-CENTERED RELIGION From the gnostics' very inception, their inner light came as a response to op- pression and dismay. The circumstance of despair with the material world that impelled their original alienated vision as well as their turn inward to dissident knowledge and meditation probably had its beginnings with first- century Jews who were shaken by the destruction of their temple in Jerusalem and the forced diaspora into neighboring lands. With their apoca- lyptic vision and hope arrested by exile and the failure of god to halt Roman armies and their endless crucifixions, some Jews from Palestine and Alexan- dria turned from faith in the outside creator god to a revelatory knowledge attained in solitude. A similar dashing of apocalyptic hope also stirred early Christians who were finding their way and from whose ranks was to come the main body of converts to gnosticism. From these multiple strands of Jewish and Christian hopelessness and from hermeticism in Egypt, mythical theologies in Babylonia, and Zoroastrian du- alisms in Persia came a new self-centered religion, based no longer on the cre- ator god of the Jewish Bible but on imaginative forces of mind seeking a personal awakening of the spirit to light. It is imperative to remember that gnostics distinguish between soul and spirit. Spirit is higher, also associated with breath {pneuma), while soul is still hylic, that is, connected to body and the earth, dependent on their form but capable, through gnosis, of rising to the salvific level of spirit. In the notion of a self-centered religion we have the essence of gnosticism's most radical contribution to the history of ideas.

The self may"},{"pageNumber":801,"pageContent":"792 EPILOGUE become god. Such flouting of authority is of course suppressed as heresy. To understand this universal push by the gnostics toward self-realization, we may remember the sixth-century BCE pre-Socratic philosopher Herakleitos, exiled for his radical disagreements with his native Ephesos, one of whose surviving sayings centers the search for mind in \"I looked for me.\" Consider the rationalist lens grinder from the Amsterdam ghetto Baruch Spinoza (1623-77), whose central ideas pronounce the words of discordant gnosis. In his day he could not say that the creator god did not exist. He said something equally radical, which he conveyed by correspondence to Leibnitz and other philosopher friends, which is that the universe is a single substance capable of an infinity of attributes, including physical extension and thought. God is not the creator of nature beyond himself. God is nature in its fullness, its plenum (Latin for the Greek pleroma of the gnostics). In Spinoza's ethical system the intellect is active and escapes earthly desires through knowledge, scientia (Latin for gnosis). A human is equal to god because all is god, which is understood in solitude by the active intellect. For his ideas, and for his higher criticism of the Jewish Bible, which he was translating, he was early excom- municated (1656), and his blasphemous pantheism could not be published during his lifetime. Elaine Pagels speaks of the gnostics' independence from the authority of orthodox religion and of god, and of god's divinity, which can be, through knowledge, found within us. She writes, \"Orthodox Jews and Christians insist that a chasm separates humanity from its creator: God is wholly other. But some of the gnostics who wrote these gospels contradict this: self-knowledge is knowledge of God; the self and the divine are identical.\" 25 In the Gospel of Thomas, a gnostic Jesus (in parabolic words resembling a Daoist saying or a Zen koan) states that while the orthodox leaders separate humans from god's heaven by placing it outside and up in the sky, god and his realm are actually inside us and everywhere outside. In the pantheism of the living Jesus, god's realm and self are identical and everywhere: If your leaders tell you, \"Look, the kingdom is in heaven,\" then the birds of heaven will precede you. If they say to you, \"It's in the sea,\" then the fish will precede you. But the kingdom is inside you and it is outside you. 25.

And despite a later sentimental view that early Christians had a unanimity of belief and charitable tolerance of outsiders, the times were intensely dangerous for dis- senting Christians and especially for gnostic Christians. In comparing the dis- sidence of John the baptizer with that of gnostic revolutionaries in those divisive times, James M. Robinson, the editor of The NagHammadi Library in English, observes that as the ingredients of Christianity coalesced and became a set doctrine, the followers of the radical Christian Jews soon became power- ful, comfortable, and conventional and took on the \"basic stance... of the my- opic heresy-hunters.\" 26 As for the gnostics, they in turn appeared to abandon traditional god and church for a personal mythopoeia to accompany, in image and word, their turn inward. Robinson writes, [Their] outlook on life increasingly darkened; the very origin of the world was attributed to a terrible fault, and evil was given status as the ultimate ruler of the world, not just a usurpation of authority. Hence the only hope seemed to reside in escape. Be- cause humans, or at least some humans, are at heart not the product of such an absurd system, but by their very nature be- long to the ultimate. Their plight is that they have been duped and lured into the trap of trying to be content in the impossible world, alienated from their true home. And for some, concen- trated inwardness undistracted by external factors came to be the only way to attain repose, the overview, the merger into the all which is the destiny of one's spark of the divine. 27 These rebels, trying to make sense of the trap of an impossible world and move from alienation to a divine spark, were, as were so many, influenced by platonic thought. They were affected by both Plato and platonism, in the writ- ings of Philo, and Greek revelation-wisdom texts from Egypt, in the Corpus Hermeticum. Other sources were Jewish mysticism as elaborated by Scholem 26. Robinson, ed., NagHammadi Library in English, 3. 27.

The prologue of the book of John, \"In the beginning was the word,\" gave gnostics a concordance with Genesis, the philosopher's logos, and platonic light. The Sethian texts carried on the Essene \"antithesis of light and darkness, truth and lie, a dualism that ultimately went back to Per- sian dualism.\" 28 Of this turbulent and creative moment, where heterodoxy and disappointment seemed everywhere, Robert M. Grant wrote about a self- centered religion: \"In the period when gnosticism arose, apocalyptic-minded Jews might have sought signs of the creator's power and his intervention on their behalf; philosophically minded Greeks might have looked for speculative wisdom, more or less rational in nature; but the gnostic preached himself and his true spiritual origin, both of which he had come to know by revelation.\" 29 So after the late first century through at least the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, in Northern Africa and virtually all of Europe, and from Asian Syria to Chinese Turkestan, gnostics were writing books of spiritual search and illumination that made self-knowledge a virtue rather than a sin. In the Origin of the World, Eve herself is not the servant of a devil snake who leads her to original sin. Rather, she is the primal heroine of self-knowledge. She also ceases to be a mere rib taken from Adam but his creator. By breathing spirit into the mouth of an inert clay figure of Adam on the ground, she gives life to the first man. As for the conniving snake, he is no longer a disguised devil but a luminous god who helps Eve snatch gnosis from the demiurge. In freeing Eve from shame and abuse, the gnostics—alone among major faiths— made woman an equal. REVIVAL IN THE WORKS OF DISSIDENT PHILOSOPHERS AND POETS After its centuries of flourishing growth and then its virtual obliteration, gnosticism in the West found its true revival in the works of dissident poets, playwrights, philosophers, alchemists, and scientists. Traces of gnostic knowl- edge was basic to intellectual history. The Swiss physician and alchemist Paracelsus (i493?-i54i) was the first modern doctor of chemical medicines and was also a student of gnostic thought. As an alchemist he sought to purify and transform nature's elements, freeing them of their low level of matter, so that nature in its purest forms could be used for curing the body and mind. In 28.

The German mystic Jakob Boehme (1575-1624) was imbued with gnosticism. In his work he spoke of the blemished but ever creating Sophia who fell from the pleroma (Valenti- nos), the seven divine source spirits (Basilides' seven cosmic spheres), god as nothingness (Basilides' nonexistent god), and god as abyss (Valentinos). William Blake (1758-1827) is the only writer in English letters to create his own complex gnostic system. His cranky and enlightened anger against cleri- cal orthodoxy runs throughout the early Songs of Innocence and Experience. It is in his long prophetic poems, however, that Blake ventures fully into gnostic cosmogonies and theogonies. The god of Reason in The Book of Urizen re- counts how in the prison of earth the mind is captive and has been deprived of eternity and light: Forgetfulness, dumbness, necessity! In chains of the mind locked up, Like fetters of ice shrinking together Disorganized, rent from eternity. In Goethe we find this mocker of convention and religion choosing Faust as his wayward hero (Saint Augustine's Manichaean teacher was Faustus) and retelling the Manichaean myth of the messenger and his distracting but re- demptive angels. In a fantastic cosmos, Faust's soul is, at the end, appropri- ately rescued from error and flown off to the realm of light. The writer of gnostic themes, seeking inner knowledge in a condemned world, persists widely into more recent times. Herman Melville's \"Fragments of a Lost Gnostic Poem\" uses the words fragment and lost in the title to be- speak the sad paucity in his day of original gnostic texts. Melville's allegorical white whale may be seen as the monster of evil out of a gnostic dualistic bes- tiary, while his alien figure Ishmael, an orphan tossed on a hostile ocean, seeks knowledge of redemption as he clings to the wreckage of survival. The gnostic revival in literature and philosophy is found in Nietzsche's nihilism and the alienated hero of his Thus Spake Zarathustra, in Carl Jung's Seven Sermons to the Dead, and in the existentialist philosophers to whom Hans Jonas dedicates his chapter \"Gnosticism, Nihilism, and Existentialism\" in The Gnostic Religion."},{"pageNumber":805,"pageContent":"796 EPILOGUE To this list of modern gnostics who, having rejected orthodoxy and its cre- ator god, chose acosmic solutions and transcendence, we can add many major figures, as Richard Smith does in his afterword to The Nag Hammadi Library in English, including \"the good alien Superman battling forces of evil,\" whom Umberto Eco sees as clearly reflecting \"Manichaean incontrovertibility\"; Her- mann Hesse's novels embodying the allegory of Jungian archetypes; and the alienated Beat Generation of Kerouac on the road and Ginsberg's outsider at- tack on convention as in his \"Plutonian Ode,\" where he chants a fitful gnostic dirge, using Valentinian and Sethian epithets: \"I salute you . . .

For Bloom the Kabbalah is his spiritual home, and Kabbalah's ally gnosticism is his \"reli- gion of belatedness.\" The figure who everywhere shares qualities of gnosticism—probably by coincidence or knowledge of the unorthodox—is Franz Kafka. His castle is the domain of the unknowable god, and his climber antihero is, as in all of Kafka's novels, a humorous, depressed, skeptical orphan, without hope of fulfillment on earth, who must climb forever seeking, but not finding, an interior light that lies still concealed in dark error. THE CHANGING FACE OF GNOSTICISM For many centuries \"Manichaean\" was an abusive term applied indiscrimi- nately to all gnostic sects, and often to any dualistic heresy. But the Enlighten- ment—its very epithet means \"entering light\"—changed all that. It welcomed gnosticism as a powerful weapon against orthodoxy. It had its secular Voltaires and Humes who used a gnostic lexicon to trash conventional reli- gion. For the irascible skeptic Hume, whose An Enquiry into Human Under- standing (1748) by its name commends knowledge, religious convention was erroneous, dark, and ignorant. He summed up religion as \"Stupidity, Chris- tianity, and Ignorance.\" In that century, which had science and reason as well as Blake's \"Self-annihilation & the grandeur of Inspiration\" (Milton), Hume was simply drawing from an arsenal of gnostic charges to battle received tra- dition and its prevailing theologies. For most of the last century, however, gnosticism may be seen not merely as a secret doctrine discovered by writers to bring the esoteric into their work or as an instrument to counter convention, but as a developing field with its"},{"pageNumber":806,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE 797 own scriptures, increasing dramatically through archeology and scholarship. Whatever its appellation, gnosticism is for real. It represents a world religion with fundamental notions and an extraordinary history. Today, gnosticism is surprisingly alive. Since the uncovering of the Nag Hammadi library in Egypt and the possession of a treasure of original gnostic scripture, gnosticism as an alternative intellectual and spiritual body of knowledge finds itself at a sum- mit. This is evidenced in the quality of the historical and religious studies that gnosticism has generated, the many new translations of core scripture, and the general esteem and curiosity that gnosticism elicits, though in-depth knowl- edge of the history and nature of gnostic speculation is still rare. Apart from genuine coincidences in thought, gnosticism and Kabbalah find themselves in a similar period of revival and respect. Contemporary interest in gnosticism is especially awake in France, where the Cathar past has become a pleasant obsession. The joy of free-spirited gnostic troubadours who sang of imperfect love as well as the massacres of a gnostic region capture the French and world imagination. The fortresses, castles, texts, and the Inquisition's city archives remain. The latter document some horrendous events in the years of the Cathar extermination, during which it is estimated that half the population of this dense region in south- western France may have been killed. Historians, anthropologists, and novel- ists have turned their attention to the papal crusade in 1209, in which a northern French army of twenty thousand came down under the crusade commander Simon de Montfort and sacked the city of Beziers, slaughtering twenty thousand men, women, and children, including Cathar perfects and Catholics priests, indiscriminately, all for the possession of the rich lands of the south and a secure place in heaven. On one violent afternoon in 1308 in the mountain village of Montaillou, all the inhabitants who were not slaugh- tered were arrested. A bishop named Jacques Fournier was the inquisitor in the city of Pamiers who interrogated the surviving heretics. Some of those who confessed under torture were given penances, others went to the stake. (In 1320 in this same area, a center of Kabbalism, more than a hundred Jews—both forced converts wearing the yellow cross and professing Jews— were burned in mass.) 30 The Cathar incident took on greater meaning when 30. \"Confession of Baruch, once a Jew, then baptized and now returned to Judaism,\" translated by Nancy P.

The pained but extraordinary history of the gnostic speculation, with its external misadventures with church and civil powers that it rejected and its spirit-filled solitude of shining darkness, is every year a more articulate mem- ory in books and images. The energy of discovery, as vital as that generated by archaeological and old temple finds, is apparent, from the Pays cathare (Cathar Land) signs that have popped up all over southern France to the growing band of serious thinkers and creative writers who have assumed the gnostic experi- ence as their intellectual heritage. DISCOVERING THE BOOK OF THE MIND The gnostics endured. The many schools of gnosticism are of supreme inter- est. Now the loot at Nag Hammadi has given us works of Sethians as well as Valentinians, the latter including the Gospel of Truth, possibly by Valentinos himself. Other major finds from the Egyptian earth are the Gospel of Thomas, those wisdom sayings of Jesus that are now increasingly printed as and called the Fifth Gospel, and the non-Christian Sethian works the Three Steles of Seth, the Paraphrase of Shem, and the Foreigner/Allogenes. The Sethians, like the Essenes before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, were largely un- known except through commentators and opponents. Whatever the school, there are general principles that go through all the gnostic teachings. We are confined to the earthly cycles of birth and death in a materialist universe, captive in the innermost dungeon that is the earth. We are remnants of spirit fallen into bodies, but bodies that retain a tiny element of salvation in them.

Then, free of matter, the liberated spirit can rise and be reinte- grated into the unknowable god. Man and woman of the earth were originally eternal spirits, aeons, who fell tragically from the acosmic pleroma, the spiritual realm of light, into a cosmos of sensation where they are completely alien to their real being. Each spirit is invested in a decaying body. To escape from that declining flesh, the gnostic's gaze is directed inward to the spark, to the intuited mystery of the uncon- scious self that was once consubstantial with the unknown god. In this split of mind and body lies the conflictive dualism between spiritual good and mate- rial evil, and ultimately between the self and the planetary world, whose dis- cord yields the human condition of alienation. Only knowledge (gnosis) of spiritual light—not faith prescribed by clergy—offers escape from the earthly dominion and return to the realm from which we have fallen. Gnosis is a personal activity, and through reading, meditation, and search, its instant of appearance is probably as wordless as it is revelatory. Such is the nature of mystical experience, of ecstatic information, of epiphany wherever it is found—whatever previous information has been fed into the instant and however the ineffable is then translated back into speech, reason, or myth. In gnostic and other mystical meditations, there is a distinctive and different preparatory word, a darkness, illumination, and union, and after the oblivion of absence a new translation of the mystical experience for the world. The gnostics were, like the Kabbalists, irredeemably bookish, and both engaged in elaborate mythology to map their transcendental journey. The Kabbalists even had god create the alphabet before creating the world so he would have speech to call the world into being. The gnostics were obsessed with recording the experience of gnosis and were prolific in creating, copy- ing, and preserving libraries of scripture. Unfortunately, rival sects erased their books, just as they burned or obscured the heretical nine books of Sap- pho's poems to her ally, the god Aphrodite, or time and neglect effaced the music and number theory of the pre-Socratic philosopher Pythagoras. But now, with the existence and wide translation of the Nag Hammadi library of gnostic scriptures and other seminal texts from China to Mesopotamia, from Alexandria to Languedoc, we have at last an intimate garden with its tree of gnosis and a pleroma of scripture detailing the gnostic word of return. We have the writings of a gnostic bible. Perhaps these books may generate an- other, preferable bible, without sect or text, without cipher or sound, which is the light in the book of the mind."},{"pageNumber":810,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY MARVIN MEYER Abathur Fallen light being, judge, and father of Ptahil, in Mandaean thought.

Eleleth is called a great angel in the Re- ality of the Rulers and plays a revelatory role in that text. Elements The four traditional elements in Greco-Roman thought are earth, water, air, and fire.

Simon of Cyrene In the New Testament gospels, Simon of Cyrene carried the cross of Jesus to the place of crucifixion. In the Second Treatise of the Great Seth, Simon is also said to have carried the cross, and \"another\" (either Simon or the body that Jesus adopted) was crucified instead of Jesus.
