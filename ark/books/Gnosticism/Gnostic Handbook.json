At first we avoided such a task as our knowledge of the Gnostic trad i- tion was still evolving and because any outline of religious symbolism can come across as do g- matic. However, as time progressed we realized that if we waited until all the facts were in and we worked to avoid all possible misconceptions, we would end up with the Gnostic Handbook never being written. Accordingly, we believe that within this handbook is a comprehensive su m- mary of the basic principles of the Gnostic tradition. We realize that what we outline in this text is unusual and rightly so, Gnosticism is a unique form of perception and hence offers a very di f- ferent worldview from that found in Christian, Pagan or Esoteric and Occult traditions. Gnost i- cism is the essence behind such outer forms and hence offers the framework from which reli g- ion, occultism and mythology create the form. In recent times with the advent of fundamentalism of all forms, a clear and preci se explanation of the ideals of Gnosticism is not only useful, but mandatory. At the onset it should be made clear that Gnostici sm is a personal experience of religion. The term Gnosis means \"an experience of knowledge\" and religion (from the Latin Religio ) means \"to bind back to the point of origin\" and hence Gnosticism is an experience of the real essence of what God is. It does not represent dry dogmatism or a simple recital of facts, but a real and personal experience of God within human experience. It is in this spirit we issue this handbook. The structure of this handbook is aimed to facilitate easy access of information on basic religious questions. This is not meant to be an e x- haustive theological exposition but a summary of the teachings which embody the Gnostic le g- acy which has been passed onto the Institute for Gnostic Studies. The approach we have taken in this handbook has been a religio us one, our primary source of symbolism has come from within the Essene, Greek, Gnostic, Zoroastrian and Christian mystical trad itions. Other interpretations are certainly possible and for those who wish to get “behind” the symbols, interpretations and b e liefs we suggest you study the various publications and courses issued by the Institute for Gnostic Studies. We hope you will f ind the Gnostic Handbook edifying as well as enjoyable reading..  INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Gnosticism as a Form of Perception What do we mean when we say Gnosticism is a form of perception ? To truly understand the Gnostic vision it is important to grasp what Gnosticism is and not to be bogged down in various historical manifestations of th e Gnostic way of looking at things. Gnosis literally means wisdom but does not mean book learning, even tradition, it is a direc t experience of the divine, the flash of wisdom that is brought when we meet “God” face to face. Certainly Gnosticism has certai n key motifs, certain perennial ideals, which we will examine in the course of this book. However, we must appreciate that there are “Gnostic” trends in most religious traditions. Whether we are tal k- ing about Odin on the World Tree and his flash of wisdom as he grasped the runes or whether we are talking on the mystic achievi ng wisdom after days of penance and fasting, both are essentially Gnostic. In some ways the best way to appreciate Gnosticism is to use the metaphor of algebra. Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses letters etc to represent numbers and quantities. Algebraic is ultimately from Arabic Al - Jabr – reunion of broken parts. Pocket Oxford Dictionary. It may be thought that Algebra has little similarity to spirituality, however, if we consider it more closely they have much in common. Algebra uses letters t o represent actions and numbers, it is a system of representation and in a sense, symbolism. This is also the case with spirituality. Spirit u- ality uses symbols to stand for realities, it uses images to represent things that cannot be easily imagined or explained. The p roblem is that Algebra is an academic form of mathematics and has little effect on everyday life while spirituality controls and influences us more than we would care to admit. Only be removing religious iconography from the realm of the emotions and apprecia t- ing it as a symbol system, as a form of divine algebra can we really understand its nature. The Gnostic handbook is one applicat ion, one representational system for the ancient Gnosis. It can be seen in many forms and using many symbol systems. Accordingly , it is important to realise the difference between the representational letter and the thing that is represented, between the e s- sence and the form. The Institute hence differentiates between its philosophical works (such as Gnostic Theurgy) and its religio us works (such as the Gnostic Handbook). To give an example, while all Gnostic traditions agree on the universe being in some sense dua l- i s tic, there are many divergent ways of expressing this dualism and even more ways to unde r- stand. Some Gnostic schools have two a true and false God, one the Essence behind all things, the other a Demiurge or false crea tors, others see the dualism as relative and only existing between mans perception (ignorance) and the truth. While all of these “representational” systems are di f- Chapter One: Chapter One: WHAT IS GNOSTICISM ? WHAT IS GNOSTICISM ?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 7 fe r ent, their essential message is the same. In algebraic terms while the letters vary, the numbers they represent are identical. T his should be kept in mind while studying this Handbook, it is one and one only interpretation of the essential Gnostic wisdom. The aim of using Algebra according to the Arabs was to have a better understanding of the real nature of the equation, to find the essential form through the many shards or forms. This too is the vision of the Gnosis, the Arabic meaning of Algebra is pre gnant with meaning – the reunion of broken parts. The Sources of our Tradition The Gnostic tradition is one that has spanned Millenniums, it represents the height of the rel i- gious traditions of Humanity. Its primary points of focus are found within Vedic Philosophy, Zoroastrianism, Greek Mystery traditions, Old World Religions (pagan and heathen) and Gnost i- cism. The Gnostic tradition is not culturally locked within the Christian tradition as many mo d- ern exponents seem to profess. It is a Pan - Gnostic tradition, which spans many traditions and cu l tural milieus. The primary assumption of the Gnostic tradition is that at some point in the dim reaches of time there was a prim al universal religion, this religion diversified as man spread across the earth and different cultures and nationalities develop ment. Accordingly, remnants of this perennial philosophy are found within the various traditions, belief systems and faiths. The se faiths rather than being the primary sources of wisdom within themselves are actually remnants of one earlier, and more prist ine school of knowledge. As time progressed the higher kingdoms saw the loss of gnosis and therefore chose to restore the struct ure of the Mysteries. When Jesus came of age within the Essenes he purified the structure of the Mystery traditions and re - ins tated the original Gnostic faith. Hence, the Gnosticism of Jesus is not superior to other Gnostic traditions, but is a refinement or adaptation of an age - long tradition. Indeed, the gnost i- cism of Jesus brought together Egyptian, Greek and Mystery Cult traditions (such as those of Eleusis and Mithra) into one cohere nt system. The iconography of Judaism played a small part but was insignificant in comparison to, for example, the Greek Mystery cult tradition. To unde r- stand this “nexus” of the gnosis we really need to jettison the old model which sees gnosticism as a Jewish or Christian heresy. As has been documented in such texts as the Jesus Mystery and J e- sus Christ, Sun of God ++++++ it is more likely that Rabbinic Judaism and Christianity are p a- gan and Gnostic heresies ! While there may be vigorous complaints and denials it is now even well known that so - called Jewish Ka bbalah primarily derived from a reworking of Neo Platonic mysticism which into Jewish religious language.. These teachings, however, did not remain available forever. As society changed and a new r e- gime came to power the teachings of Jesus were suppressed and replaced with the political faith of Emperor Constantine, and acco rdingly the Gnosis went underground to ensure its survival. What we have in today's religious movements are not the original forms of Judaism and Christ i- anity, but apostate faiths masquerading in their place. The Bible itself has been tampered with to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 8 such an extent that only through much critical study can we restore just some of its inner mea n- ing. The Institute upholds the original inner teachings of Jesus as part of a continuum of wisdom which spans from Pagan to so - c alled Christian sources. But it is perhaps desirable to state unequivocally that the teachings here, however, fragmentary and incomplete belong neither to the Hindu's, the Zoroastrian, the Chaldean, nor the Egyptian Religion, nor to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism or Christ i- anity exclusively. The Secret doctrine is the essence of all these. The Secret Doctrine, Madame Blavaskty. Behind the veil of all the hieratic and mystical allegories of ancient doctrines, b e- hind the darkness and strange ordeals of all initiations, under the deal of all sacred writings, in the ruins of Nineveh or Thebes, on the crumbling stones of old te m- ples and on the blackened visage of the Assyrian or Egyptian Sphinx, in the mo n- strous or marvellous paintings which interpret to the faithful of India the inspired pages of the Vedas, in the cryptic emblems of our old books on alchemy, in the ceremonies practised at receptions of all secret societies, there are found indic a- tions of a doctrine which is everywhere the same and everywhere carefully co n- cealed...the key of all divine obscurities and the absolute queen of society in those ages when it was reserved exclusively for the education of priests and kings. Transcendental Magic, Eliphas Levi. Gnosticism and other Ways of Knowing In these days of science, technology and the rule of rationalism it is hard to grasp the ancient view of wisdom. Knowledge was not simply to know about something, but to know something, to appreciate its place within the living cosmos (the Great Chain of Being). The scient ific model with its emphasis on experimentation and materialism, removed man from his place within a li v- ing universe and replaced it with a universe of dead and inert substances. Experimentation was used to buttress a belief in the scientific method, yet \"the scientific method\" was a system based on self delusion. Experimentation is used to prove the results of a given thesis, the experiments created are those which fulfil the requirements of the thesis, others are rejected. A simpl e mathematical example can be used, if the hypothesis or answer is 7, we can use \"experimentation\" to \"prove\" the data. The answer, however, could be 4 +3 , 6 +1 or 5 +2, d e- pending on how you want the result the data is selectively chosen. The scientific approach hence is self - referencing, it demands the acceptance of certain pre - defined ideals (such as evolution, progress and the supremacy of the experimental method) and the n moulds the data, consciously"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 9 or unconsciously, to fulfil the data. Critiques of the scientific method are many but for the obse r- vant the results of the scientific method are most pronounced when he looks at the world itself. The results of unbridled science and rationalism are illustrated in our consumer society, our u n- quenchable thirst for technology and progress at all costs, and the resulting polluted and dying continents. Materialism, Ration alism and Fundamentalism go hand in hand, once you reject the possibility of a wisdom (gnosis) that is greater than the collecti ve psyche of man, then the mind becomes the point of reference. Ethics become irrelevant, as do spiritual values and principles, in their place appear the relativism of the modern society whose primary focus is on progress. If you co u ple this with the disposing of religion by Darwinian science then man is reduced to a animal, no more, no less and his behaviour and values come to reflect this unconscious revelation. Fundamentalism is, in some sense, the encroachment of Rationalism into the religious field. My s ticism and esotericism (inner teachings) are rejected in favour of doctrines and beliefs that can be understood by a blinkered u se of the rational mind. While fundamentalism is ambivalent to the intellect, it uses a restricted form of rationalism to hold i ts doctrines in place, accordingly, fundamentalism is most prevalent in religions of \"the book\" - Protestantism, Islam and so fo rth. While other forms of fundamentalism exist, the most pernicious forms are those which in rea c- tion to materialism and scientism use rationalism to create a stalwart of dogma and doctrine, and yet in the process destroy the very foundation of the true religious vision - mysticism. To appreciate the esoteric and mystical view of truth we need to trave l back to Ancient Greece and examine the allegory of the cave as used by Plato. This allegory, beyond all others, offers us a re al insight into the problem of what truth is. Plato sees all of humanity as prisoners, each of us has been kept chained in a sub terranean cavern from birth, facing a dark wall. Only a very small amount of light enters the cavern and this comes from a small opening high overhead. Because of our chains, we look in opposite direction and hence can only observe the dark shadows which pass along the wall we are facing. These shadows are cast by the men and occurrences of the u p- per world beyond the overhead opening. Our perceptions and hence of the shadows and refle c- tions, Plato's major contemplation was on what would occur if one of us escaped from the cave ? Plato’s answer is found in his w ork The Republic, where Socrates tells us that at first the escaped prisoner would be blinded by the strength of the light of th e upper world and would retreat back to the shadows. But only for a while..... He would need, then, to grow accustomed before he could see things in that upper world. At first it would be easiest to make out shadows, and then the images of men and things re flected in water, and later on the things themselves. After that, it would be easier to watch the heavenly bodies and the sky it self by night, looking at the light of the moon and stars rather than the Sun and the Suns light in the day time...Last of all, he would be able to look at the Sun and contemplate its nature, not as it appears when reflected in water or any alien medium, b ut as it is in itself"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 10 in its own domain....And now he would begin to draw the conclusion that it is the Sun that produces the seasons and the course of the year and controls everything in the visible world and moreover is in a way the cause of all that he and his companions us ed to see . Republic, Plato. 516ff. Plato, then, is illustrating for us the state of Man, his insight is clear and precise. Man is chained by his attachment to his perceptions which are based on materialism and rationalism. The only r e ality he sees is a reflection and this reflection creates an illusionary world around him. The true source of what he perceives is found in the World of Ideals and yet he cannot even contemplate this source since his view of reality is conditioned by his b elief in the primacy of the material world. The World of Ideals is the real source of wisdom but to appreciate this world, we m ust expand our understanding of reality from the limited perceptions of sense to a multifaceted universe of many dimensions and realities, we must move from the mountains of earth to the \"Great Chain of Being\". This \"Chain of Being\" we will discuss further in this work, in the meantime, we need to consider what is means in regards to how we understand truth or gnosis. The religious systems, ideologies and movements which have evolved within the history of man are reflections, distortions and adaptations of the truth which exists unsullied in the world of Id e- als. Rather than truth having evolved and developed, as some would tell us, truth has dissipated as time has moved away from the first point of creation. Accordingly, like a stone thrown in a pool, we see the ripples through time but do not comprehend the first event. As we have moved further and further away from the \"Golden Age\" the ripples have become more and more di s- torted until now, in the Age of the Wolf they have dissipated into the pool of illusions. Religions, ideologies and movements ar e hence exoteric. Exoteric - of philosophical doctrines, treatises, modes of speech, etc.: Designed for or suitable to the generality of disciples; communicated to outsiders, intellig i- ble to the public. Hence of disciples, etc. Belonging to the outer circle; not admi t- ted to the esoteric teaching. Oxford English Dictionary Esotericism (the inner teachings) are elusive and hard to find, they have been passed from \"mouth to ear\" through brotherhoods, sects and orders. They do not evolve, while their appea r- ance may change from age to age, they exist as memories and reflections, transmissions from the Golden Age (the equivalent in ti me to the World of Ideals) through history. While esotericism can take any form from Hindu to Buddhist, Christian to Islamic, it is at the core, distinct from each. It is trans - temporal and yet being in time takes the appearance of the country, tradition o r"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 11 epoch it is clothed by. At the same time we must appreciate the form it takes, esotericism is not ecumenical, it is dangerous to assume that all esoteric traditions are the same. Islamic esoter i- cism (Sufism) is distinct from Buddhist esotericism and while both are part of the Lore they should not be mixed and combined in to some - kind of occult eclectic soup. While at the core es o tericism is unified gnosis, in time, in history and in our experience it takes many forms and has many appearances and these mus t be appreciated for what they are. Similarities are noted, comparisons are useful but we must not believe that similar systems are the same Esotericism and Modern Language When we consider the gnosis an important issue regarding language arises. The issue is that many (perhaps most) of the concepts, beliefs and mental structures we have are artificial, they have evolved as the soc iety around us would like them to evolve. Hence to really understand the gnosis there is a great need for you to put aside your pre - conceptions. This will be difficult as so many words have connotations which have been deliberately programmed to have us re act in certain ways. We have developed certain \"understandings\" of Philosophy, Religion, Demo c- racy, Politics etc..... all of which may or may not be true, but nevertheless all of which probably originated from the system around us, rather than from within the perennial tradition. It is a l- ways important to realise the extent to which language can be moulded to suit different worl d- views and used to create specific reactions and impressions. In some ways we might agree with the discussion in Alice in Wonderl and between Humpty Dumpty and Alice... \"When I use a word\" Humpty Dumpty said... \"it means just what I choose it to mean - neithe r more nor less\". \"The question is\" said Alice, \"whether you can make words mean so many different things\". \"The question is\" sa id Humpty, \"which is to be the Master - that's all\". Through the Looking Glass. Lewis Carroll. To appreciate the gnosis you wil l need to put aside your beliefs and assumptions and reconsider most of what you have been taught. It is imperative that you und erstand the terms we use and the context they are used in. Many of the words and concepts we present, though obviously from the English language or more specially from the language of esotericism, have little or no connection to the concepts of the same na me in the modern usage ! Now, stop for a moment and consider the fact that we have already used a number of these pr o- grammed \"buzz words\"... Occult, Esoteric, Exoteric, Reincarnation, Gnosis, Mystery teachings.."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 12 ...and each of these will trigger a certain association for you. For example, you would probably relate the term Occult to somet hing sinister and evil, and yet the word itself simply means \"hidden\". Members of the medical profession, for example, use the t erm occult bleeding for bleeding which comes from an unknown source. Hardly sinister or demonic I would suggest. Again and again we must emphasise that to understand and appreciate the esoteric worldview you need to put aside the associations, prejudices a nd pre - conceptions you have and consider new meanings for the terms that are used. It is important for you to understand the lan guage we use in the context of how we use it, and not in terms of prevailing religious terminology. We are not asking you to jus t accept everything we say or blindly agree with our redefinition of old terms. What we are asking you do to is temporally suspe nd disbelief, enter into your studies with us and only make a decision after you have seen the whole picture. So let's consider some of the terms we have used and will use.. The term Gnosis comes from the Greek word meaning \"to know\", but it means the proc ess through which the seeker of spiritual wisdom experiences the divine and is transformed. The teachings which make this transformation possible are considered Mystery Teachings b e- cause they embody the most ancient wisdom, the essential essence behind the worlds religious and ideological systems. In this sense they are Esoteric , eso - meaning inner, they are the inner teachings that are b e- hind or beyond the secular, they are core religious wisdom available to the few. They are Occult in that they are secret, hidde n or unknown. They are Religious in the sense that religion means \"to bind back\", \"to return to the source or origin\". These tea chings are those which lead back to the World of Ideals from which we have become alienated."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The reference point for modern man is the material world, he judges life by his perceptions and acts accordingly. His life is he nce governed by physical desires and materials requirements. This way of life, whether it be Western consumerism or Marxist materialism, was created by the d e- ve l opment of the (Western) scientific worldview, whereby man was removed from his place at the center of the universe and reduced t o his new status as an \"evolved monkey\". Beginning in the 19 th century (some would argue earlier) prevailing ideologies began to jettison God, spiritua l- ity and the Medieval worldview and replace \"superstition\" with a \"scientific\" model based on matter, evolution and technology co upled with a belief in progress. This new scientific model was and is a direct contradiction of the earlier \"traditional\" model, which was based on the \"Great Chain of Being\". This Great Chain is the traditional view of the universe which is not locked i n a simple \"nuts and bolts\" view, but which encompasses the great span of existence from the very heights of spirit to the depth s of the infernal realms. The Great Chain of Being while expressed in many cultures is not doctrinally specific, it can be found in Hindu, Buddhist, Platonic, Christian and Mystical co s- mology, it is found throughout literature from myth and legend to the visions of Dante. \" The plan and structure of the world, which, through the Middle Ages and down to the late eighteenth century most educated men were to accept without que s- tion - the conception of the universe as a \" Great Chain of Being\", composed of an immense or infinite number of links ranging in hierarchical order from the me a- ge r est kinds of existents.. through every possible grade up to the ens perfecti s- simum\" Great Chain of Being, Arthur Lovejoy. Modern mans vision of reality can be seen like those locked into Plato's cave, he perceives only shadows and presumes these to be real. This is far more dangerous than we admit, for if we limit our reality to our sense alone then we remove all possibility of ethical or spiritual insight and r e- duce existence to material banality. While psychology may wish to somewhat expand our hor i- zons by positing spiritual equivalents within the mind, it is still reductionist and everything is re f erenced back to the senses and the material world. If it is from matter we come, then to matter we shall return. A useful alle gory may be that of a chess game, the pieces move and we assume they do so of their own volition.

IN PARTICULAR This Work is Dedicated By a Humble Native of Flatland In the Hope that Even as he was Initiated into the Mysteries Of THREE DIMENSIONS Having been previously conve rsant With ONLY TWO So the Citizens of that Celestial Region May aspire yet higher and higher To the Secrets of FOUR FIVE or EVE N SIX Dimensions Thereby contributing To the Enlargement of THE IMAGINATION And the possible Development Of that most and excell ent Gift of MODESTY Among the Superior Races Of SOLID HUMANITY Preface to Flatland If we for a moment accept the reality of the Great Chain of Being, then we can theorise that the universe is multi - dimensional and has many levels of existence. If we consi der this for a moment and ponder how \"real\" our dimension seems to us, then perhaps other levels would be perceived as concrete and real as our own from within their own vantage - point. This very concept was the basis of a fascinating story written by Edwin.A.Abbott in 1884 called \"Flatland\". Originally pu b- lished under the pseudonym of Mr.A.Square, it was found to be the work of an English clergyman and Shakespearean scholar, whose fascination with mathematics led him to publish this tale. The importance of Flatland is that it helps us conceptualise the po ssibility of altered dimensions from the perspective of geometry. Now, I am not Edwin Abbott and hence, I cannot paraphrase his story in a way he would appreciate, but I can give you the gist of the tale. (I would also su g- gest you go a buy a copy, it has been reprinted by Dover Books and is available in a very ec o- nom i cal edition). Imagine a world of only two dimensions, a world of beings who only know \"across and side to side\" and have no know ledge whatsoever of up and down. These entities live in a diverse world of squares, triangles, circles as well as many other \"na tionalities\". They live in a world much like our own, except for one thing, they are flat. Imagine one day Mr.Square enters"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 15 his flat home, walks across to his flat lounge and sits down (however that is possible in two d i- me n sions) and begins to read an even flatter book. Suddenly a voice comes to him from another dimension, this voice is actually com ing from Mr.Jones, a traveller from the dimension of Up, but Mr.Square does not know this. Mr.Square cannot see him because Up d oes not exist for Mr. Square, all he experiences is a loud bellowing, but disembodied voice. Mr.Square, by now obv i- ously terrified, demands that this being makes himself known to him. Mr.Jones with the aim to oblige and enter into inter - dimens ional communication, lowers himself towards the ground in Mr.Square's home. Mr.Square cannot see the totality of Mr.Jones, all h e sees is the points and lines of Mr.Jones body where they connect to the two dimensional lines of his lounge room. Mr.Square co mes quickly to the conclusion that he is communicating with a weird selection of lines and points. From this conclusion he decides he is either quite mad or that he has had a li t- tle too much to drink from his flat bottle of Gin. Mr.Jones is not happy, he does not like to be thought of as a weird and disjo inted collection of lines and points. He grasps Mr.Square on his two dimensional shirt and lifts him into the air. Mr.Square is ecstatic and very confused, where is he ? He has no idea of the dimension of Up and hence cannot understand the experience, as he begins to hover above the ground he see his friends below, but they cannot see him. However, as he returns to his two - dimen sional world, at the moment of contact he re - appears, seemingly out of nowhere. He tries to explain but how can they understand dimensions beyond their two dimensional perception ? This tale illustrates the hypothesis of other dimensions, if we attempt to translate a cube into two dimensions we know that what we arrive at, is nothing but a reflection or an approximation. We know th at in a cube all lines are of the same length, yet, in a two dimensional representation, the length of the lines seem to vary. According to modern G e- ometry if we take a cube and apply it into a further dimension we arrive at what is known as a \"Tesseract\". This cannot be illustrated as it exists in four dimensions, all we can see is its refle c- tion as a cube inside a cube. Theoretically, however, we know it exists ! Giving some consideration to this tale we may begin to hypothesise about various planes, d i- mensions, worlds or orders of existence. If we project our cube into higher dimensions, we can create an infinite progression until we reach some final point of conclusion. In the ancient trad i- tions this has been known for a long time, and while the number of levels or planes may vary d e pending on the esoteric tradition, the model - The Great Chain of Being remains remarkably the same. In the words of Arthur Love joy, author of \"The Great Chain of Being\" - \"It (the Great Chain of Being), has been the dominant official philosophy of the larger part of civilised ma n- kind through most of its history\". The Traditional Model of the Universe. That sign is the sign of the cross, which very clear ly represents the manner of achievement of this realization by the perfect communion, of all the states of the being, harmoniously and conformably ranked, in integral expansion, in the do u- ble sense of ''amplitude \" and \" exaltation \". In fact, this double expansion of the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 16 being may be regarded as taking place horizontally on the one hand, that is, at a certain given level or degree of existence, a nd vertically on the other, that is, in the hierarchical superimposition of all the degrees. Thus, the horizontal direction repr esents \" amplitude \" or integral extension of the individuality taken as basis for realization, an extension which consists in t he indefinite development of a given group of possibilities subject to certain special conditions of manifestation; and it should be clearly understood that. in the case of the human being, this e x- tension is in no very confined to the corporeal part of the individuality, but i n- cludes all its modalities, of which the corporeal state is properly only one. The vertical direction represents the hierarchy, l ikewise and a fortiori indefinite, of the multiple states, each of which, when similarly considered in its integrality, is one of those groups of possibilities corresponding to one of the \" worlds \" or d e- grees, which are included in the total synthesis of \" Universal Man \". In this cr u- c i form representation, the horizontal expansion therefore corresponds to the i n- definitude of possible modalities of one and the same state of the being, regarded integrally, and the vertical super - imposition to the indefinite series of states of the total being. Symbolism of the Cross, Rene Guenon If we wish to conceptualize the \"G reat Chain of Being\" there is a simple place to start. Let us b e gin by viewing material life as a horizontal line, on this line we have everyday existence, we could even use two lines to refer to the influences of time and space. In any event these occu r- rences are horizontal, they exist within the experience of time, space and matter and hence exist on the material line. At the same time we can suggest this line is intersected by another, a vert i- cal line, the line of spirit. Whereas the horizontal moves from life to death, beginning to end and repeats again and again, the vertical moves from Alpha to Omega, from the heights to the depths. This image, the cross, is the primal image of the Great Cha in of Being and traditional cosmology. It is pregnant with meaning and within it are the central concepts of gnosticism. If we consider the cross and the intersection between the spiritual and the material, we can also contemplate the variations in ideals b e tween these two extremes. The material emphasises the physical, material and quantitative, while the spiritual emphasises spirit ual, ethereal and qualitative. The Vertical line represents ethics, content and meaning, the horizontal represents results, activity and relati v- ity. The interface between these two lines is within the \"Sacred Ce n tre\". It is from this centre that we can begin to unfold some of the major concepts of the tr a ditional view of the world. The Sacred Centre is the point where man touches the divine and can come u n- der the influence of the spir i tual world while existing within the physical, it is only at this nexus that enlightenment is possible. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 17 If we consider the image of the Cross we can delineate certain characteristics, there is the S a- cred Centre, the Vertical Line becomes the Axis Mundi, the horizontal line becomes the Earth, above which are the supernal worlds, below which are the infernal. This map of the living co s- mos is central to the sacred lore. While it may take many forms in the traditions that abound on planet earth, the essential cha racteristics are the same. When applied to traditional models of the universe, the horizontal bar of the cross becomes the Earth , Midgard, physical reality and the Axis Mundi becomes the pillar that spans the worlds. It is sometimes images as a vertical se ries of planes, worlds or dimension, a tree, a ray (the Ray of Creation of Gurdjieff) or a pillar. I n- deed it is the beanstalk that Jack climbed to reach the world of the giants ! The Axis Mundi and the Sacred Tree The Axis Mund i is the pillar and at its center is the nexus of earth, the earth turns on this center and its horizontal (physical) reality is formed. The turning marks the cycle of time. \" If you are calm, clear - headed and rationally decisive, people say you are well centred or focus. In that saying is our instinctive recognition that everything has its proper centre which is also its essence . The essence of an individual, one’s center and citadel, is the mind. But it is not the ultimate centre... The idea of a fixed centre and a continually moving periphery has many illustr a- tions. It is like a wheel turning on an axle, a rope swung round a vertical pole, a compass making a circle. A grander cosmological image is of a spherical un i- verse, with the spherical earth at its centre, both revolving upon the same unmo v- ing pivot, the world pole. In all traditional systems of religion this image has provided the dominant sy m- bol\" At the Center of the World John Michell, Thames and Hudson 1994 Working from this model, we can go further and delineate t he characteristic of the Axis Mundi or Cosmic Tree. The Cosmic Tree can be imaged in two different manners – organic and em a- n a tion. The Organic model is found in most pagan and heathen traditions, it emphasizes the change some nature of the worlds and pl anes. The emanation model is more formal and while it infer the ever changing landscape of spirit it has more clearly delineated worlds, planes and i n- habitants. Whichever we use, both have certain general motifs which are the basis for the Great Chain of Being. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 18 Characteristics of the Traditional Model The first is the point of origin, this is only described in negative terms (by what it is not). The second is considered the upper world, it is sometimes imaged as the world of the gods but in a Gnostic system we prefer a more impersonal description. This world includes any number of “original principles”, it is the higher reaches of Plato’s World of Ideals. In the general Gno s- tic - Theosophic tradition it has a triune principle. Within the triune principle is the power of polarity, this is important as it gives rise to the sexual polarity of most pagan traditions and the balance between Mind and Intuition in others. The third i s the other world, it is an intermediate reality and is comprised of any number of planes, worlds or locales. These can be described in semi - analytic terms as planes or dime n- sions or in more organic terms as worlds, halls or localities. The fourth is the earth or the physical world. The fifth is the underworld, the realm of the dead. In most organic models this is seen inside or below the earth, in the emanation models it is usually related to the moon and seen above or around the earth. The third, fourth and fifth characteristics are more noticeabl e in organic models, in emanation models they tend to be included within a gradient of states or worlds. These can be any number , but in the Gnostic Theosophic approach tends to be seven. To fully appreciate these characteristics we shall take some case s tudies of specific cultural \"maps\" which outline the traditional model of the universe. The Neo - Platonic Cosmos One of the pi votal figures within the history of traditional cosmology is Plato. While before him both Pythagoras and Socrates are of great s ignificance, it was Plato who outlined the major cha r acteristic of the Great Chain of Being - Ideals. For Plato an Ideal was more than just a n o- tion or idea, Ideals existed eternally in the World of Ideals (similar to the Gnostic Pleroma) and had eternal, abstract qualities. It is from this World of Ideals the lower worlds emanate, resul t- ing in the physical world. Platonism, Neo Platonism and Gnosticism argue between themselves in regards to the nature of matter. While all posit a Demiurge which created the material dime n- sions, the nature of this being (from demonic to malefic, bungling to a demi - god) depends on the school and sect. Plutarch (45 - 1 25AD), for example, posited a negative world soul (Demiurge) and hence heralded a reconciliation between Platonic and Gnostic th ought. When the Platonic model was combined with Pythagorean mathematics a hierarchical structure r e-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 19 sulted. This early model which spanned the universe from the \"All\" to matter, was probably the map from which later Kabbalah and Medieval occult schematics evolved. Plontinus, a classic Neo - Platonist, outlined a map which was founded on the indescribable One (En) who is the causeless cause. Plontinus also called it the Good and the first god, Protos Theos. Below En is a series of hypostasis or emanations which make up the Great Chain of B e- ing. Below En is the Nous or \"Gods thought\" in which exist the Platonic forms of Archetypes. From Nous emanates Soul (Psyche), a nd then Psyche emanates the World Soul and individual souls. The World Soul has higher and lower natures, one of which is the ar chetype of nature, Physis. It is from Physis that the material world emanates. The three primary emanations of En, Nous and Psyc he form the nexus of Plotinus' system. In terms of our characterises, this model includes the indescribable one (1 st C), Protos Theos, Nous and Psyche (2 nd C), Platonic Archetypes (3 rd C), the World as emanated by Psyche (4th C), while the underworld is h idden within nature which has its own consciousness (physis). This dualism between the spiritual and physical we will return to later, the two aspects of the world soul are one of the most important misunderstood aspects of Gnosticism. Theosophical and Mo dern Maps The Theosophical map is found in many new age and spiritual books. Most of these have adapted and distorted the model and not really come to grips with the full depth of the vision held by Mme. Blavatsky and others such as Steiner, Alice Bailey and Max Heindel. This map was developed by Madam Blavatsky and from the Theosophical movement migrated into a range of cosmologi es, it is found adapted in systems ranging from Max Heindel's Rosicrucian Cosmo Conception to the work of Rudolf Steiner and Ali ce Bailey. In Theosophy and related traditions, there is an original nothing or absence (1 st C), a triune pri n- ciple of Will, the Word and Wisdom (2 nd C) and a series of seven planes which bring together the other characteristics. The unde rworld is subsumed within the astral plane which is Heindel’s Desire plane. The Seven Planes according to the Rosicrucian Cosmo - Conception (Heindel) Divine Plane. Plane of Virgin Spirits. Plane of Divine Spirit. Plane of Life Spirit. Plane of Thought. Desire Plane. Physical World..

(For example, relating seven planes to the seven bodies of man, seven co l- ours and rays etc). It can also be counter traditional and reductionist. The tendency is to use the seven planes in a standard \" scientific\" chart and ignore the more organic view that was held of the planes in early Theosophy. In the next chapter we will examine this in more detail and co n- sider it in terms of the Gnostic tradition. The Kabbalistic Tree of Life The Kabbalah is a system of some controversy, it has been heralded as the greatest mystical sy s tem of all, handed down by Moses and guarded by the Jewish people. The problem with this largely mythical tale is that the Kabbalah was not d e veloped til at least the 6 th century AD and incorp o- rated Greek and Gnostic images, forms and traditions. Indeed it has been suggested by both Ba r bara Thiering and Gershom Scholem that the very image of the Tree of Life was derived from Greek rather than archaic Je w ish mystical sources. While the Kabbalah is of course overlaid with imagery of Old Test a ment, Jewish, Christian (and sometimes Gnostic) la y ers, it is primarily a Greek Neo Platonic model. The Tree starts with nothing, the great void or emptiness behind all things, this is known as Ain (1 st C) Ain at various cycles moves through transformative stages and manifests three principles ( 2 nd C) Kether The Divine Will Chokmah The Logos Binah Sophia (Saturn) We have deliberately chosen Gnostic names here to prep are you for there use in our Gnostic model of the universe as presented in the next chapter.

There are many attributions related to the Kabbalah and as a system of classification it is e x- tremely useful. Again we must avoid the tendency towards reductionism and see the centres more as a landscape in which townships meld into each other rather than an a classification scheme from a biology textbook ! Yggdrasil:The World Tree Nine world I can count, nine roots of the Tree Volupsa Nine lays of power I learned from Bolthorn, Bestla's father Odin in the Havamal Ygg drasil is a prime example of the organic model of the Great Chain of Being. In the Elder Edda Yggdrasil is identified as a sacre d Ash Tree, it becomes obvious that this is no ordinary tree but a tree which glyphs the worlds and which encompasses many strat a's of reality. In the Grimnismal Yggddrasil is described as having three great roots, one lies under Hel, the realm of the dead , under another dwell the giants and under the third live human beings. A squirrel runs along its branches, an eagle nets in its crown, four deer browse on its branches and a dragon gnaws at its roots. In the Volupsa the sacred Ash is described as very tal l, always green and moist, the source of dew and as having the Well of Destiny (Urd) as its roots. At Ragnorak, the \" towering a sh trembles, and the world tree howls\". \" The Ash is of all the trees the biggest and the best. Its branches spread out over all the world and extend across the sky. Three of the tree's roots support it and e x- tend very, very far. One is among the Aesir, the second among the frost giants, where Ginnungagap once was. The third extends ov er Niflheim and under that root is Hvergelmir, and Nidhogg gnaws the bottom of the root\". Gylfaginning, Younger Edda Snorri Stur luson, Trans. Antony Faulkes. Yggdrasil is one of the more poetic and expressive images of the Great Chain of Being. In some forms of Northern worship it was celebrated with a \"gigantic pillar\", one of which, Irminsul was renowned for its size, but was destroyed by Charlemagne in his attempted conversion of the Sa x- ons in the eighth century. From the world tree extends nine worlds or realms, five of which are on the central axis and four in the directions. Pathways link all the worlds with the central Axis."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 22 (The system of nine rather than seven duplicates the principles of fire and ice as distinct worlds, this is not found in later models of the universe such as the Anglo Saxon) The world in the center is called Midgard. The word Gard means dwelling, it is obviously related to the word Garden. Midgard is Middle Earth, the garden in which ex live our lives. It includes the physical w orld as it is perceived by our senses. Encircling Midgard is the world serpent. (4 th C) Niflheim is the realm of ice and darkne ss, while Muspellsheim is the world of fire and heat. The interaction between fire and ice, Niflheim and Muspellsheim (2 nd C) i s a major dynamic within the activity of the world tree. This interaction occurs in Ginnungagap (1 st C), an empty abyss, where the fire of Muspellsheim mets of the icy rivers of Niflheim and from this dynamic the g i- ant Ymir is born. Odin and his brother, born from giants, carve up the body of Ymir to create Midgard. Ymirs bones become the mo utains, his teeth the rocks, his blood the rivers, his skull the vault of the sky, his hair the forests and grasses. Like the Ti tans, Ymir's death creates mankind. Hence Midgard is a checkerboard on which fire and ice battle against each other until the ga me is completed. From the interaction of Fire and Ice within the Great Gap, the planes or worlds are formed. This model when ex amined critically (we will return to it in the next lesson) has a lot in common with the Kabbalah and Theosophical plane models. Together they give us a good overview of the Great Chain of Being. The planes or world below the triune forces of the Void, Fi re and Ice are: Vanaheim is the world of the Vanir. It is the realm of fertility, wealth and fecundity, fields of lu s- cious crops, fruits, wildlife and pastoral beauty. Jotunheim is the home of the giants. There are three types of giants, Thursa r, Rises and Etins, all children of Ymir. Ljosalfheim is the home of the Light elves or lojosalfar. There are two classes of el ves, the light inhabit the lighter realms above Midgard, while the dark elves (dwarves) inhabit the subterranean realm. Asgard, the home of the Aesir of Sky Gods is above the elven world and is the crown of the World Tree. The name Asgard means \"enclosure of the Gods\". Within Asgard is Valhalla, the Hall of the Fallen where the warriors of Odin are taken if they are killed in batt le and from where they will return to the final battle or Ragnarok. Snorri Sturlson describes an inner enclosure (gardh) as bein g built right within the center of Midgard, the sacred space of human society. Ho w ever, this enclosure, this true essence of Midgard as Asgard, can only be entered by crossing the Bifrost."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 23 Within Asgard is also the halls of the Gods, these are twelve in number and many relate them to the Ideals or forms which are r elated through the Zodiac. Between Asgard and Midgard is the Rainbow Bridge or Bifrost, a secret path which is taken by the god s when they join council meetings of the council of the Gods at the well of Urd, it is guarded by Heimdall. The above worlds ( including Asgard) are considered facets of the other world (3 rd C), while the underworld (5 th C) includes those below.. Svartal fheim is the realm of the dark elves which exist in the subterranean world under Midgard, they are also known as Dwarves. In th e lower realms of the underworld lies Hel, the realm of the dead. The worlds are traditionally listed as the Gap plus nine wor lds, these correlated well with the model we will discuss in the next chapter. Where there is a triplicity above (Void, Fire and Ice) and seven worlds below. Each of these models offers us a glimpse of traditional cosmology in action, concepts such as the Axis Mundi, Sacred Centre (Midgard) and the various worlds are delineated. Each of the models we have presented (albeit in brief form) offer different views of the Great Chain of B e- ing. Most have much in common. In our next chapter we will offer a Gnostic model of the universe using these examples to e x- pand and refine what the Great Chain of Being means to the seeker of gnosis. In the previous chapter we discussed the basic fram ework of the Great Chain of Being, its five characteristics and gave some examples of this model in esoteric systems. In this ch apter we want to “put flesh on the bones” and outline a specific model of the Great Chain of being based on a Gnostic - Theosophic system. This model owes a lot to the early Greek Mystery Traditions (the source of Gnosticism) as well as to later Gnostic and Theosophic traditions. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Who or What is God ? One of the central issues within any religious tradition is who or what is God ? In traditional faiths a s well as within esotericism and mysticism there is clear definition of God though this may be expressed through many diverse im ages and language forms. These definitions while d i vergent in form, have one thing in common, they all define God without the using descri p- tions in moral or ethical terms. God simply Is. In some sense this is central to the Gnostic u n- derstanding of God for he/she/it is beyond definition, to define God in any way, is in some sense, to limit he/she/it. For the S aivite Hindu, for example, the supreme deity is defined as Shiva with Brahma and Vishnu simply being modes or personas. While in other traditions, Bra h man or Vishnu is supreme with the other deities being modes of its expression. In each case, there is still a further more trans cendent form, the Parabrahm (or ParaVishnu/Shiva), each being defined as beyond definition with the traditions of divine activit ies being relegated to the lesser forms or manifestations or interpreted in an allegorical fashion. In the Zoroastrian faith t itles such as Ahura Mazda are superlative definitions of a first cause, while in the later derivative Mithraic faith God was def ined as Zurvan or the Lord of Time, since fate or time was believed to be the principle which is beyond all things. For the Gnos tic, God simply IS . He/she/it is the one source beyond and behind all things, in both the Zoroastrian and Israelite faiths God i s usually simply called Lord as this designates a title of respect for a s u perior. While these definitions are all, in some sense, useful, mystics and Gnostics usually go a step fu r ther, they define God by what it is not. This use of negative imagery allows the very first principle to be beyond all form, def inition and human projections. In many tradition is is achieved by the use of a paradox so we have descriptions such as the unmoved mover, unorig i- nate originator and so forth. In Zen Buddhism we have the description of the Tao as the “Tao that can be spoken is not the Tao”. In Gnostic literature we also have some very poetic repr e- se n tations of this first source. The Gnostic concept of god is more subtle than that of most exoteric religions. It reconciles the supposed differences between so - called monotheistic and Polytheistic traditions, as well as uni t ing such models as Theism, Deism and Pantheism. Chapter Three: Chapter Three: First Principles First Principles"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 25 What’s in a Name ? The issue of the name of God is an important one, for in some sense to give something a name is to define i t. For Medieval sorcerers to know the name of a spirit was to control it. In the Gno s tic tradition we understand the frailty of the human spirit and the desire to project huma n- ity onto divinity, this tendency towards anthropomorphism is a dangerous one. Too often man in his suffering desires to bring t he Gods down to a more physical level, when this happens the currency of divine imagery is debased. While certainly images, lege nds, myths and Godnames have their place, their value is in what they represent rather than in themselves. In regards to the nam e(s) of God in the Old Testament there is a real quandary, there are many names for God, though translated under the one title i n English. What makes it more difficult is that each name has a different meaning, the name Elohim, for example, means Mighty On es (note it is plural) and can be applied to any form of demi - god, destructive or constructive, of the light or of dar k- ness. The same applies to the formula of YHVH, while it has a esoteric meaning, it too, has been twisted to reflect the barbar ic and violent storm God that is falsely represented throughout the Old Testament as the creator. For Gnostics there are literal ly two Gods within the Old testament period, the original I AM, the transcendent one of the light and the Barbaric thought form which became the nationalistic warlord of later fundamentalist Judaism. For these reasons Gnostics tend to avoid the Old Testam ent names of God altogether and use the more common terms of the Mystery tradition. The Pleroma The first principle is the sou rce of all light, the Unoriginate Originator. However, this principles does not exist alone, throughout time he/she/it expands and contracts filing the spiritual dime n- sions with luminous beings of all orders and forms. In the Valentinan hierarchy, for example, there are eight major forms (Aeons ) and twenty two minor. In the Gnostic Theosophic tradition there are three principles and seven lower planes or dimensions. The processes by which these realities are created are complex and vary from tradition to tradition. Each of these interpret a- tions can be further expanded to include a whole universe of luminous realities, from the hig h- est forces or Aeons to choirs and angels. Traditionally this complete spiritual kingdom is known as the Pleroma or fullness, b ecause it is filled to the brim with light and life. At the same time, the major spiritual forces within it are known as Aeons. While in the Gnostic tradition we tend to emphasize the three principles, the Divine Will, Logos and Sophia and the Seven Spirit s or Aeons, there is a universe of created b e ings which exist in the Pleroma and which fulfill the creative directive expressed by the Lord of Wisdom.

The Divine Will The Divine Will is the first principle of actio n, it is Kether in the Kabbalah and Brahma in the Hindu traditions. It is the creative principle, not in the sense of matter but in beginning the em a- n a tion process through which the whole Great Chain of Being with its world, dimensions and multitudes of life are manifested. Log os and Sophia The two principles which are manifested and work in unison with the Divine Will are the Logos and Sophia. The Log os is the divine mind and the concept came directly from the Greek Mystery traditions. Indeed as early as 6 th century BCE Heracl itus stated that the “Logos was shared by all”. While Orpheus stated “Behold the Logos Divine, thread well the narrow path of life and gaze of him.” It is from this tradition that the Gospel of St.John derives it model as expressed in the early verse “ I n the beginning was the Logos”. The Logos was known as Spenta Mainyu in the Zoroastrian tradition in mythology it is sometimes t he pre existed state of the Son of God. There are many positions in the Great Chain of Being for the Logos and Sophia and as we study further complex myths and legends of their power will be discussed. However, in their most pr i- mal form they work within the triangle of force in the upper world. What about Jesus ? One of the major debates in Christianit y has been about the nature of Jesus. However, when we examine the New Testament in a critical manner some important facts come to light. Jesus over and over again claimed to be the Messiah and a Son of God, but not God himself. He prayed to the Father and spoke of God as a separate entity to whom he was obedient. In the Gospel of John the identity of Jesus is the central theme, th e aim of this Gospel is to show the reader that Jesus is a Messiah, the Son of God, not God the Son (John 21:31). While John him self clearly tells us that Jesus distinguished himself from the father who is the \"Only one God\" (John 17;3, 5:44, 6:27). We als o find St.Paul clearly describing Jesus as the first - born of every creature and the firstborn of the dead (Col 1:13,15,18). This is echoed in the Book of Revelation where we read that Jesus is the \"Beginning of the Creation of God\". Over and over again we find nothing of J e- sus being God or even equal with God.

In many Gn ostic traditions many sons of God are acknowledge, however Jesus was believed to be the first created entity, Michael. Jesus exi sted in the first estate (before coming into a physical body) as Michael, that immortal who plays such an important role in mystical Christian trad i- tions. When Michael is born into the Essene community, he becomes Jesus. At his Baptism, a f- ter years of training (the so - called Lost years) he became the Christ. His special Essene training had involved processes that c leansed the human state by the power of Sophia and transformed his bodily vehicle into a form that was made pure enough for the communion with the Logos. Jesus as an individual, discrete being (Michael) still existed but communed with the Logos within him. Jesus was not and is not God or the Logos or Christ, he became Christed and hence in that understanding is known as Jesus the C hrist. The term Christ means \"anointed\" and refers to the state of sonship to the Lord of Wisdom. Jesus at his baptism communed with the Mind of God (Logos), his actions came to embody the Spirit of God (Sophia) and he became a full son of God (Christ). W e speak of God, of the Son, his Word, and of the Holy Spirit and we say that the Father, the Son and the Spirit are united in power. For the Son is the intell i- gence, reason and wisdom of the Father and the Spirit is an effluence, as light from fire. In the same way we recognize that there are other powers which su r- round matter and pervade it. Athenagoras Generally speaking the ancient Gnostics primarily viewed Christ as an eternal, c e lestial power, the Logos with which it is possible to have an intimate, personal relation, since our higher consciousness is mad e in its image. For this reason, Gnostics stressed the experience union with the divine and showed little interest in the historical Jesus, whom it has always been impossible to know in a co n- crete sense or even accurately in a historical sense. Jesus Christ, Sun of God. David Fideler, Quest Books. 1993 . The state o f Christhood is a state to which all of us must aim, it is the state by which we return to the Pleroma. The Logos and Sophia are energy fields emanating into the lower worlds and if permitted will transform us into immortal beings.

The general understanding of the Holy Spirit as found in the Christian tradition is a desexing of the great fe minine power. Sophia is the goddess or feminine principle and as such exists from the earliest pagan traditions right through to the Greek Mysteries and Gnosticism. In Gnostic li t erature she is described by many names – the All mothers, Mother of the Living, Shining Mother and the Holy Spirit. Sophia is se en as the counterpart of the Logos and cannot work without. It is hence suggested in esoteric Gnostic literature that it was the combined power of J e sus and Mary Madgadene who transmitted the Mysteries, not Jesus alone. The Sophia tradition has survived hidden under the veil of Christian piety, it is still found in the cult of the Virgin Mary and is most powerful in the Russian orthodox traditions. I t is a tradition of great age and some beauty that personifies the power of the Holy Spirit as distinctly female. For example, i n Proverbs particularly we have Sophia wandering the street begging men to love her. While in the following quotes we may even begin to think that Sophia or Wisdom is sep a- rate, yet in reality, Sophia is a facet of the Lord of Wisdom himself. Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the str eets: She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scor n- ers delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: I When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruc tion cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord:They w ould none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

This great being, both royal and feminine, who being neither God nor the Eternal Son of God, neither angel nor saint, receives the veneration of the One who a c- co m plishes the Old Testament, as well of the One who is the begetter of the New Testament; who is she, then, but the truest humanit y, the purest and most whole of beings, the macrocosmic whole, the living soul of nature and of the universe ete r- nally united and uniting in the process of time with the divine and uniting all that is. The Pillar and Foundation of the Truth, Pavel Florensky. The importance of Sophia can be best understood when we understand the primal myth behind her nature. Throu ghout many cultures there has been the legend of the Goddess who is stolen from the world of life and is taken to the underworld . There she is kept captive pinning for her lover who is still in the other world. She waits and pines until at last some salvat ion is achieved by her hero coming into the underworld to save her. However, this salvation is at a cost and together they end in a battle against the underworld until the completion of the tale. Though there are many modifications of this tale, it is th e story of the spark of God within man. Mans true self is caught in the coils of earth and is lost in the co n- sciousness of matter. The nature of the spirit - spark within man is that of being a seed, God in p o- tential. In Hebrew it is called the Ruach and interestingly, one definition offered of the Ruach is Sophia. So, here we have an Israelite version of the classic tale. The spirit of God in man is a spark, a seed of Light, it is caught in matter and crying out for Salvation. The Logos embodied in Jesus answers the call and through great suffering offers salvation. But it is not that simple, for while Sophia still lives in the world system, she can only travel to the upperworld by day and must return to the u nderworld by night or so the legend goes. So man, on the Path of Transfiguration, though being reborn through the powers of th e Pleroma must live in the world, but try not to be of it. Sophia hence offers us some fascinating insights into the nature of G od. She is the Daughter of the Divine Will and yet is the part of the Divine Will itself, she is the Spouse and Lover of the Log os and the Spirit within Man. She is reflected in the light hidden in nature, the Ecclesia, the Gnostic Scripture and Man, and illustrates the pre s- ence of light in all things. In each of these things Sophia is manifested. In the material world Sophia is the presence of God in nature. Even after all the pain man has inflicted on it, nature still exhibits the divine spark, though its luster has been sorely diminished. Sophia is the Bride of the Logos embodied in the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 32 Ecclesia, in the Scriptures Sophia is Wisdom and in man she is the very essence which changes him from mortal to immortal, she is the Holy Spirit.

Sophia - The Wisdom of God. Sergei Bulgakov, Lindisf arne Press, 1993. The concept of Sophia is alien to many western Gnostics and yet when we clearly study the B i ble in the light of the Gnosis, we find she is an integral part of divinity. When we consider how often the concept of Sophia is linked to the concept of Wisdom, we can achieve a deeper understanding of the power and beauty of the Pleroma. The Polarity of the God and the Goddess While the three principles (sometimes called the Triangle or Triune Principle (Singular) work in unison, in many traditions there is a strong emphasis placed on the polarity between the L o- gos and Sophia. While many Gnostics would tend to avoid overt anthropomorphism and see these more as principles, other tradition s place a strong emphasis on the God/Goddess nature of the polarity. These traditions range from those of paganism and heathenis m to the syzergies of Valentinus. While there is nothing wrong with using myth and legend to “put flesh on the bones” of met a- physical principles, we should note confuse the image with the essence. Certainly there is a wide range of God and Goddess image s which fit nicely on this polarity, they also move down through the planes and have other expressions. If we use the Kabbalisti c model for a moment we can see how the pagan concept of the Horned God and the Triple Goddess arose. The Horned God manifests a s the Logos in Chokmah and then as the Sun. These are his two modes. While the Goddess manifests as the Old Crone of Saturn (Sop hia/Binah), the midwife (Lunar) and the girl child (earth). These images are pregnant with meaning and certainly help us appreci ate the power of these principles beyond simple mental speculation. However care must be taken for it is too easy to reduce the gods to images which fit our preconceptions and by using a gender based polarity we can easily end up with both misogynist and h omophobic models."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 33 That which is NOT Divine Will Daughter Mother Crone T hree Phases of the Goddess (Sophia): Earth, Moon and Sa t- urn.

Rather than there bei ng conflicts between pagan and so called Christian, theism and non theism and related contradictions, we find that all alternati ves are reconciled within an all encompassing system. This is the insight which gnosticism gives, it shows the esoteric mea n ing behind religious symbol systems and in some sense bypasses them by divining their true meaning. This does not degrade the ro le of myth, legend, tales and scriptures but places them in the real position, that is, as the outer flesh or form of the Myster ies. Scriptures cannot stand alone, within the gnosis at their heart, they become as stone. Impersonal to Personal As part of the Gnostic worldview is the understanding of the role of personalism in religion. By personalism we mean not only theism (the w orship of a personal god) but the use of gods and goddess with personality, character and humanness. This tendency is found in all religious tr a- d i tions, while in the pagan traditions the gods seem more human, it is certainly also found in the Monotheistic traditions as well . Jehovah and Allah at times seem all too human. For the Gnostic the impersonal is the highest principle, the “unoriginate Origi nator” is without personality in a human sense of the word since it is beyond all of our preconceptions and projections. While t he three principles of the Divine Will, Sophia and the Logos can be given iconographic and lite r- ary form they too are essentially what they are called – Principles. They are not personalities, they are not “personal deities” . Accordingly Gnosis is a form of perception, feed by the minds and fueled by the emotions. It does not, however, greatly emphas ize devotion (Bhakti) that is f o cused or obsessed with image, sound, form and so forth. While we understand and use the power of images, to become devoted to one such image is to ignore its true nature. Indeed, o b- session with an image of the divine can lead away rather than to the higher principles. There are myriad spiritual forms throug hout the Great Chain of Being. In the Gnostic system, there are many, many names for them. As they are in the dimensions below t he upper world they are “partial” representations of aspects of the divine and each has its own unique essence, form and so fort h. While these too, at heart are Principles, there are more and more degrees of independence and uniqueness as we move down the emanation ladder. So, for example, by the time we reach the astral worlds, there are millions of spirits of varying characters a nd forms, each unique. None are absolutely good and evil but there are variations in their attitude towards man. While these sp irits have their own unique essence and expression, the form they manifest in is due to us, not to them. They are clothed by the language and mythology of our cultures, her i- tage and traditions. We should always keep this in mind when dealing with different symbol sy s tems, it is not the “letter” that is the most relevant, but the spirit. It is too easy to confuse the images of the divine as fo und in literature and myth with the reality and become locked in forms which only partially represent the unique characteristics of a spirit, god or form. In some sense we must transcend the Gods to understand them."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 35 The Solar Logos – Christ The term Christ means “anointed” and it is the force of the Spiritual sun. It is represents the co m- pleted individual in which Sophia and the Logos have transformed consciousness and the medi a- tor at the nexus of all systems. The Solar Logos, Christ or the Sacred Sun transmits the tran s- for m ing energies of the triune Principle throughout the planes. It is the door through which the energies of the upper world communi cate with those of the planes. It can be imaged as the dying and reborn sun and hence related a wide range of God - man myths and legends. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. John 10:9 The Sun can be also however harsh, it dries out the land and kills the livestock as well as brin g- ing out the change of tides and the flourishing of life. This reminds us that creation and destru c- tion are the normal cycles of the universe and we must grow through them not being too attached to the material experience. Since the Triune principles do not directly manifest in the lower worlds the Solar sphere b e- comes the intermediary, the manifestation and the gateway. In some sense this is where the le g- end of the incarnation or Avatar originated. The belief that God came into the lower worlds is an adaptation or analogy to the p rocess whereby the Pleroma manifests via the solar sphere into the lower planes. For the Gnostic, Jesus, for example, was Michae l, a created being who incarnated and became Christed, he was not God made flesh. There are many other entities who being Old Souls achieve Christhood and become Son/Suns. In this sense these entities become manifest a- tions of the Sun and hence we can appreciate how the incarnation motif became accepted. Ho w- ever, the anthropomorphic tradition of God actually entering matter as God is a corruption of the Solar mythos and a misundersta nding of the essential Gnosis. Gods and Spirits The Great Chain of Being is brimming with life, there are spirits, Gods, Aeon s, so many forms with so many names. It is simply best to say that as the emanations proceeded from the higher principles throug h the Seven Spirits (see below), myriad forms of life are created. In our Gnostic tradition these are generally categorized as t he Seven Spirits or Logoii (sometimes also known as Aeons), the Immortals or Masters who work within each plane or ray and spiri ts. These spirits are of many forms, from the higher to the lower. There are many, many ways of categorizing them from the Kabba listic to the Medieval, from Neo Platonic hierarchies to those of Christian angelology. While we are offering one model it is up to the individual student to explore and e x- pand their understanding through considering the many descriptions of these forms. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 36 The Seven Spirits According to the Gnostic traditions the triune principle manifests through a series of seven Logii or in mor e traditional language Archangels or spirits. These forms can be expressed in many different ways, the most traditional is to kn ow them as Aeons, while in Egypt they would have been called Sacred Principles or Neters. In the Zoroastrian tradition they are known as the Holy Spirits (Spenta Amesha). (These are akin to the Seven Spirits before the Throne in the Book of Revelation). T his links interestingly with some western traditions, which see the Seven Spirits before the throne (Revelation 4:5) as seven ph ases of the Holy Ghost. These Aeons or spirits have many different aspects and facets, they may also be related to the Seven Rays of the Theosophical and Rosicrucian Mystery traditions. In the heavenly hierarchy these spirits are again emanations from the truine principle and under them are formed the Immortals, beings that embody each ray or spirit. And out of the throne pr oceeded lightning and thundering and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven S pirits of God.

Spenta Mainyu  The Holy One Further to this, the Seven Logii form the body of the universe or Great Chain of Being. It is from their forms that the seven planes of existence come into being. This is one of the most i m- portant aspects of the Gnostic teachings. The seven planes are not simply geographic locations, they are living, growing, transf orming bodies which are enlivened by the seven Logii. It is the sane with the physical plane, it is not inert matter but is aliv e. The earth is not simply a ball of dirt in space, but is Gaia a immense organism which is as much alive as we are. Each plane sub - divides into lesser planes and each plane dimension has its own consciousness and reality. In this model everything is inter - related. So, for example, man is in a unique symbiotic relatio n- ship with Gaia which in turn is part of a greater web of spiritual energy which makes up the Logii of the physical plane.

(This may seem at odds to the traditional dualism of much Gnosticism, however, we will e x plain in some detail later what Gnostic dualism really is and, bluntly, it isn’t what most people think!) The various realms th at exist can be understood as planes, dimensions, realities, locales or worlds, depending on what perspective you may wish to ta ke.

There are other models such as th e four worlds of the Kabbalah and the more complex Valentinian scheme of some thiry aeons. We are not stating one is more correc t than the other, we have simply chosen one model from within our tradition to expound.

In the cycles of creation this is the plane from which polarization and differenti ation originated. It is on this level that the Seven Holy Spirits o p erate and direct creation."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 39 The Spiritual Plane. This is the plane of archetypal forms and is the location from which energies from the upper planes are condensed and radiated into the lower. This is the plane on which the Immortals e x- ist. The Intuitional Plane This plane is also known as the Intuitional Plane. It is the dimension where the forces and a r- ch e types take creative solidity and manifest. On a human level, it is the dimension of high level intuition and cosmic awareness. The Mental Plane This is also known as the Mental Plane. Here the flood of energy takes the form of reason and thought, bluepri nts are formulated and laid. The Astral Plane The Desire plane is also known as the Emotional or Astral Plane.

The Physical Plane The world on which we live. The Earth and the Under world On a critical examine of our models one will notice an anomaly, in the organic models (Yggdrasil etc), the underworld is beneath the earth, indeed in Medieval Mysticism hell (the “Christian” underworld) is even within the earth, being at its centre. While in the Emanation model the underworld is called the Astral Plane (even the Spirit world) and is above the earth, rule by the Moon. The first thing to note is that the underworld is not hell. There is no heaven and hell in the Gno s tic system, the underworld is the realm of the dead and where we experience the afterlife. Some people create their own “Heavens and Hells” there but that is another story. The models we are outlining cannot be reduce to scientific charts, while there are seven planes they inte r- mi n gle and meld. The planes exist behind, through and within the physical and they interpen e- trate each other just as much. The astral plane can be imaged under, inside or above the earth,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 40 all have the same imagery. It is somewhat a matter of how we conceptualise the universe. The model of the astral plane above th e earth, ruled by the moon has a more hierarchy feel, while the underworld communicates more on an emotional level. The model o f the underworld also brings to mind the ancient polarity of Earth and Sky. The Earth and Sky polarity was probably the most anc ient model of the universe, while the Logos and Sophia model is central to Gnosticism, this older structure is found in many nature reli g- ions. The Divine Will is seen as either the Cosmic Father or Mother and the earth is the wife, husband or lover. In this mytholo gy the underworld is intricately connected to the earth, even seen as part of it. In the Norse tradition the God is Odin or Tyr (much earlier) and he is the lord of the upper world (Asgard) and Hel is the Goddess of the underworld and earth. Hel and Freya are much the same Goddess, she simply split into two and was demoted due to strong patria r- chal and later Christian influences. She was the goddess of death and rebirth, fertility and su f- fe r ing, she guards the dead and sends them back to life, she compliments and completes the Lord or Tyr/Odin. In Celtic mythology she guards the great cauldron and in the Norse this cau l- dron is the “seething cauldron” from which the drizzle formed from fire and ice coalesces and from which life is formulated. We can see a cross over with Sophia, she too is the goddess of the departed and the earth. This system also embraces the Logos and Sophia model but e x- presses it in a different way. The danger with overtly nature oriented symbolism is that it ge n- derizes the principles and while this offers some beautiful literature and mythology, it can also transform the Gods so that the y appear in our own image, which degenerates the principles into warring, fighting and marauding reflections of ourselves. (and this is certainly true with the V i- king tradition). So once again we can marvel at the imagery, but should be aware of its limit a- tions. The Immortals The Immortals are those beings which work within the force of the seven planes or rays. The seven Logoii emanate currents of force throughout the planes (called Rays) and through each there is a spiritual hierarchy. In this work we w ill not discuss these in details but you can read about them in our other texts. While some traditions have brought the Master tradition into di s- r e pute with their ever channelling ascended yahoos etc, this should not be allowed to discredit the real and important role of tho se who work within the Great hierarchy.  "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Complexity of Evil The major problem with understanding evil is that there are many forms of evil and these are mixed toget her. It is especially difficult when cosmological “evil” is mixed with issues of ethics and personal suffering. While the iconog raphy of evil certainly appears in all cultures, one of the most potent icons is that of Satan. It is a difficult image because most people do not apprec i- ate the various motifs which have been woven together to make the one figure. It is quite clear from Old and New Testament sour ces (as well as apocryphal texts) that Satan meant something very different at various times. These differences have been overlo oked within contemporary Christianity due to its desire to “frighten” the sinner into salvation. For the esotericist it is i m- perative to decode these perennial motifs are they solve once and for all the mystery of evil. The image of Satan has three pri mary motifs within it, these can be found in the Old Testament, Apocryphal sources (with some OT/NT references) and within the N ew testament. These are mirrored in other esoteric traditions, for example, the Old Testament view of Satan as Tester is also fo und in Hinduism. These three motifs can be summarised as follows: 1. The Satan - Saturn Complex — The illusion of cosmological evil. (Perceptional Dua l- ism) 2. The Watchers — Evil as ignorance. (fallen astral forms). (Temporary Dualism) 3. Evil as Ignorance - (Ethical Dualism) These thre e models are found quite clearly in different forms of scripture. The Satan as Tester image is primarily Old Testament, the Watc hers are found primarily in the Book of Enoch (but also referenced subtlety in the OT & NT), the image of Satan as Bad Mind is p rimarily New Testament. These three motifs are found in all aspects of Gnostic, Essene and Christian liter a- ture. For example, the Demiurge. The Demiurge as Saturn is not evil but only the harsh school teacher, yet within the watchers t he Demiurge is desire (pride, uncontrolled lust etc). All fallen spirits are Demiurges, all have desire to leave their station a nd enter earth. While the Demiurge in man is the Ego. These three different motifs explain the strange amalgam of tales we have throughout the Bible about evil which range from the fall of Lucifer (light bearer) (the watchers), Jesus calling Peter “ Sata n” (ethical dualism) and the Book of Job image of Satan as Tester. Chapter Four: Chapter Four: The Secret of Saturn The Secret of Saturn"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 42 The Secret of Saturn The darkest aspect of the Gnostic tradition is that of dualism. So many people who read about the Gnosis a ccept at face value that the Demiurge (or creator) is evil and that matter itself is, if not evil, then a mixture of darkness an d light. This anti - matter, anti - body position tends to be found in extreme Christian Gnostic sects and has continued today throu gh Christian Puritanism and some new age Gnostic derivatives, Heaven’s Gate UFO cult is a prime example. To unde r- stand the nature of the Demiurge and hence the true Gnostic position on the world and matter we need to provide a background on some of the myths involved. There are many traditions and explanations of how this occurred, ranging from the fall of Sophia to the Genesis tale. For the Valentinians the primal error occurred after a long process of hierarchical expansion, the Unoriginat e Originator expanded into manifestation and hierarchies on hierarchies took form. Each hierarchy manifested a further hierarchy until, finally, the last emanation, Sophia was created. Sophia, being the last creation, did not understand the nature of what had occurred, in her anguish she cried out for the Divine Will, in this state of suffering she emanated Ialdaboath. Ialdaboath in his ignorance believed he was the creator and formed ma t- ter, by his error, Sophia herself became trapped in his creation as did thousands of beings of light that came to believe his er ror. This tradition is intriguing as it paints the Demiurge in an i g norant rather than malefic role, in some sense it embodies the ambivalence found in much He r metic literature where the “false creator” is seen more as a blundering demi - god than as a a d versary. For the Kabbalists the fall occurred on a far more ethereal level, when the cosmic light of Ain Soph began to expand it produced emanations known as Sephiroth or light centres. As these S e- phiroth or light vessels began to create a hierarchy of being, a reflection was cast onto the ocean of cosmic spirit and this re flection, being distorted, gave birth to destructive and twisted forces (Klippoth), which in turn created the material world. Even among the Gnostics there are many variations in interpretations of the fall. Some trad i- tions see the creator as the Divine Will or Sophia, others see the creator as the Demiurge and hence evil. Some have two Yahwehs , a true Light Lord and a false substitute. Some sects refute the whole Old Testament saying it is the work of the False Yahweh, while others even see the serpent in Genesis as a premonition of the savior. For a more modern twist, one science fiction wri ter (with a penchant for occultism and a strange adaptation of psychology) outlined the Gnostic myth in a more technological form. Mi l- lions of years ago in the spiritual dimensions, a spirit entity decided he wanted more power than was his due, he created a sequ ence of mind traps or games. These games or traps enthralled the other spirit beings and as they became involved in them, they found themselves creating mat e- rial reality. The final game involved forgetting who they were and entering into matter, hence, they entrapped themselves. Modern adaptations of the Alpha Event are not unusual. For exa m-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 43 ple, there is much discussion about the possibility that extra - terrestrial entities genetically e n- g i neered mankind. These theories were made popular by such writers as Zecharia Sitchin and on a more vulgar level by Eric Von Dani ken. Whether we wish to use a highly spiritual and ethereal description such as that by the Kabbalists or see the supposed fall of man in more m a- terial terms it is of little importance, something occurred and the algebra we use to represent it is somewhat irrelevant. The Church teaches that God is the source of all perfect and that the whole world, visible and invisible, is His creation. Yet one does not need to be a ph i- losopher to observe that in this world of ours moral and physical evil - suffe r- ing, cruelty, decay, death - is abundantly present. How then can God, the s u- preme Good, be the cause of suffering and evil ? Must He be held responsible for wars, epidemics, the oppression of the poor by the rich ?....The Bogomils (A Medieval Gnostic sect) had an answer which was at least logical and consistent; evil and pain are inherent in this world because the world is the creation of the Evil One. The Byzantine Commonwealth, Obolensky What are we t o make of such speculations. Is the world really evil ? or worse Is the creator of the world evil ? The first thing we need to do is to consider how this model arose and then e x- amine the esotericism that exists behind it. The first thing we need to consider is how the di f- ferent models of the creation of matter developed. Some traditions, such as the Hindu and Greek, tend not to demonise matter. Wh ile such schools admit there are degrees of darkness and light and forces which are helpful to man and those who may wish to hinder, none are a c- t u ally seen as absolutely evil. Certainly in the pagan traditions the Gods have many aspects and the appearance of totally evil gods seems to have been the result of Christian influence. I n- deed even the post primitive of cultures while placating so called “destructive” spirits see these as protecting the land or a s acred site etc, there is little evidence of so called ontological evil. While some schools are “dualistic” and see a conflict be tween matter and spirit this is more a conflict between mans attachment to matter and spirit, hence the emphasis is moved from c osmology to perception. If we examine the multitude of myths regarding the creation of matter with this in mind we begin to see an answer to our dilemma, these models are talking about different things. Some are talking about cosmology, others about person al evil. So in the Hindu, Greek and other systems the question is more the nature of ignorance and evil from the perception of m an, while the Gnostic and Kabbalistic seem to be discussing how suffering etc arose and tracing this back to a cosmological stru cture. "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 44 Perceptional Dualism This begins to hint that the problem is not with the universe but us, it is our perception of the universe which is the issue. Evil, so to speak, is in the eye of the beholder and hence extremely dualistic gnosticism is a product of “those who suffer” and this seems quite clearly so. To su g- gest the world or the creator is evil is really a personal perception and since Gnosis means pe r- sonal wisdom then we can see that the Gnostics were recording their personal insights alone, not offering eternal truth. Each in sight may vary not only according to the environment and e x perience of the author, but to the stage of his or her life and the suffering he or she has or has not experienced. Dualism ther efore is a matter of perception, not one of cosmology. In the Institute we call it “Perceptional Dualism” . The nature of percep tional dualism is much like that of a classroom. Like children in school we may sometimes hate our teachers and other times love them. Long after schooling has ended, later in life we may look back and suddenly realize how much it helped us, but during the period of harsh discipline we may despise the process and the teacher(s) involved. On a cosmological level evil cannot exist, if the Great Chain of Being unfolded from a single principle then everything must have its place and role and to suggest a separ ate ontologically evil force destroys this balance. So how does evil exist ? This paradox is symbolized in the Gnostic astrologi cal traditions as the planet Saturn. Saturn is both Sophia, wisdom and Satan, the tester. In the Old Testament Satan was not a r ival to god but worked within Gods court to test and trial the faithful. Saturn is hence a dual image and it is to Saturn that the title Dem i- urge is usually applied. Saturn is also Sophia and through Ialdaboath matter is created and yet we may ask – why was it a “sin” for Sophia to want to know or understand the Divine Will ? It seems clear that this supposed error was actually the process by w hich Sophia (and with her mankind) could enter matter and achieve an understanding of the Divine Will. This model is duplicated in Genesis where the serpent tempts Eve and Eve is seen to “fall, yet in reality Eve begins a necessary journey into the materia l world, symbolized by putting on coats of skin and being dispelled from the Garden. The entry into matter was hence painful but necessary. So while Saturn/Sophia may have caused the material world and its suffering and pain, it is through realizing that t his world is only a “classroom” that we see through the Demiurge/Satan and find wisdom behind it. In the ancient mysteries this was represented in strange initiatic rites. In these secret rituals the neophyte would be lead to a goat, donkey or sometimes a strange statue (Baphomet). These animals were made to look as disgusting and obscene as po s sible. The neophyte would then be asked to kiss the backside of the creature. If they r e- fused they would have failed the initiation, if they went ahead and “puckered up”, they found they were kissing the lips of the Priestess. Here clearly is the movement from one mode of Sa t urn to another, from the Demiurge to Sophia. The Knights Templar did something similar where their large “devil” like Baphomet f igure actually represent the Sophia, the Goddess of wisdom. (Indeed, the world Baphomet when decoded with the Atbash Gematric co de gives the name Sophia !) If we accept that dualism is perceptional therefore pain, suffering and the trials of life are rel a-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 45 tive. Pain and Suffering may seem nearly intolerable from the perspective of those locked within it and for those experiencing the harder end of life. However, if we accept that as ind i- viduals we have many lives and that incarnation is for the purpose of development, then we may after some consideration comprehend the reality that pain and suffering is part of a lear n- ing process. However, since our minds are limited by material experience we do not perceive the full picture and hence treat our material reality as the final arbiter of experience. Pain and suffering are real, but only relatively so. Things will seem diff erent if looked at from the wider perspective of multiple lives and worlds. While we may have disposed of cosmological evil, th e question still arises as to how does Evil appear in the world ? While we may accept that pain and suffering, disease, death et c are not “evil” except from our own perceptions, how do we explain murder, rape, war and the more d e- structive of man’s behaviour ? The last phase is probably the most important, Man’s behavior. So much that we would like to blame on the Demiurge, God, Spirits or anything else is actually the fault of mankind itself. As Robert DeGrimston discusses in his superb essay “Humanity is the Devil”, the cosmological devil or Saturn is not “evil” but simply a tester, it is mankind who has become evil, through its ignorance. Ignorance is the problem, for in ignoring our true natures we become enmeshed in matter (which is of itself spiritual neutral) and following our desires become more and more i g- norant. While matter is neutral, our lust and desires lead to behaviors that can be best described as evil. These occur because we are seeking in matter something it cannot give, matter is there to give us an experience which leads us back to spirit. If we attempt to gain wisdom from ma t- ter then we will become more and more frustrated, like a rabid consumer, we seek more and more goods and yet nothing satisfies t he craving. Dualism then is between Spirit and Ignorance, the Upper Worlds and our attachment to matter, not between spirit and matter themselves, since ultimately, they are part of each other. The Watchers of Enoch They thought of themselves, that they were beings existing by themselves and without a source, since they do not see anything else existing before them. Therefore the y live in disobedience and acts of rebellion, without having humbled themselves before the one because of whom they came into be ing.

Nag Hammadi Tri.Trac 79:12 - 32 "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 46 While we have shown (at least I hope so), that there is no cosmological evil, that does not mean evil cannot or does not exist. Since every entity has free will, then ignorance can occur on mu l- t i ple levels of existence. Hence, it is important to realize that some spirits can also work in a way that is not beneficial or ev en harmful to man. Just because a spirit is not physical does not mean it is more developed or evolved, astral denizens are much the same as us (indeed the h u- man dead are part of the astral kingdom) and hence can share our own ignorance and stupidity as well as our joys and illuminatio ns. While certainly Gnosticism does not accept the reality of beings that are intrinsically evil. We do accept that since man has free well and can make hi m- self evil through ignorance, so astral spirits can do the same. These fallen spirits are described in many Gnostic texts and can certainly gang together and influence man in a destructive way. These spirits are not intrinsically or ontologically evil, but have become evil through ignorance, desire and so on. This is important as it proves there is no evil god in competition with th e source of all life, no hierarchy of destruction, but ignorant spirits and entities. The legends of the Book of Enoch which p ermeate so much Biblical literature suggest that since these spirits desired to have physical bodies they entered the earth stre am and interbreed with man producing giants and depraved offspring. This is why the Great flood occured, not to destroy man but to purify the earth of these mutated forms. This desire however continued and brought about not only the corruption of many astral realms but allowed these spirits to inca r- nate on earth ! This last fact is important and has far more significance than we may realize. As we will discuss in another wor k it is possible many of these fallen spirits have taken physical form and are now in controlling positions in governments and i nstitutions. If we believe that spiritually destructive forces are working on many different levels, then we cannot ignore the existence of these forces on the physical plane as well as on the spiritual. For centuries there has been a belief in a Secret G overnment which manipulates and controls world politics, while conspiracy theories may seem, at first glance, unbelievable, whe n we consider the current state of world affairs then it does seem that some sort of nefarious plan has been in operation. In Co nspiracy or Degeneracy by Revilo.P.Oliver we read the following... A theory that a conspiracy has been working consciously for many centuries is not very plausible unless one attributes to them a religious unity. That is tantamount to regarding them as Sa tanists engaged in the worship and service of supernatural evil, the directors of the conspiracy must see or otherwise directly perceive manifestations which convince them of the existence and power of Lucifer (Satan). And since subtle conspirators must b e very shrewd men, not likely to be deceived by auto - suggestion, hypnosis,or drugs, we should have to conclude that they probabl y are in contact with a force of pure evil .. This quote illustrates the real focus of the world conspiracy theory. It is not en ough to posit the existence of a secret government behind the scenes, we need to ascertain the nature of the forces which govern this secret government. "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 47 And clearly these forces are the powers we have described and those who rule these secret bodies are the Dominions and Principa lities we have discussed. There are more books than we can list that identify the Secret Government and its links with bodies su ch as the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group and the United Nations, however, only wh en we grasp the clear indication that these bodies are operated by alien entities, entities without souls controlled and manipu lated by destructive Archons do we really understand the full nature of the world around us. I am not so interested in identify ing and describing these individuals as I am in calling your attention that they do exist. John the Baptist as he preached the coming of the Christ, foretold the end of this race of mechanical men when he said \" O generation of vipers, who hath warned yo u to flee from the wrath to come\" . Again referring to the barrenness of this counterfeit creation he said, \" Every tree therefo re which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire \". He prophesied the coming of one who would baptise with the sacred fire..\" Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his gar ner, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable \". Needless to say these human automatons are the chaff and their final end can come through only one process: Transmutation. For this is the only approved method whereby the wicked shall be removed f rom the face of the earth. In the Bible these soulless beings are referred to throughout as the wicked for they have seen to it that all more specific descriptions of their race have been removed - lest mankind discover them and rise in righteous indignat ion against their overlords. And thus the death of John the Baptist and that of Jesus the Christ were brought about by the count erfeit race who for thousands of years have set brother against brother, race against race and have caused the children of God t o blame one another for the murder of the saints. Today, as always, they occupy positions of authority and financial power. They have gained control of the destiny of empires and they seek ever to thwart the purposes of God.

The doctrine of Dominions and Principalities is one of the more difficult to explain without sounding extremist and paranoid. It certainly lends itself to dark speculation and cons piracy theories. However, it is a doctrine that is central to a real understanding of the world around us and there is certainly more to come, since the Watchers not only live among us but through i n- te r breeding are part of our own genetic make - up ! In some sense it is mandatory for our Transfiguration to realize the extent to wh ich our bodies, mind, world and reality are controlled and manipulated by forces hostile to our spiritual goals. Archons, Domi nions and Thoughts that Run Wild There is a simple premise in esoteric literature, thoughts have power. Even modern science a c- cepts that behind the structure we know as the material work is a web of energy and the intera c- tions between different types of energy creates the semblance of solidity we call matter. Thought, then, as a form of energy has the same power. This is why in so many tradition there are admonitions about controlling the thought process, while thinking and doing are still diffe r- ent things, thinking does have its effects. Clairvoyants of many persuasions have seen and doc u- mented the shapes and forms produced by various types of thought, witness the work of Charles Leadbeater. While many of these fo rms are fleeting, when empowered by the emotions and by reverie and memory they become more than just thoughts, they become thou ght forms. These thoughtforms exist beyond simply when they are thought, they take on an independent existence within the mind o f the thinker. They then influence memory and condition our perceptions of everyday life. We may want to see these thoughtforms as only existing within the psyche of the neurotic or unstable and yet all of us have our lives conditioned by the though forms we have created in the past. For most people they never see the present unfiltered, all experience is sieved through thoughtform s created from childhood and even beyond through past lives.

Memes function the same way genes and viruses do, propagating through communication networks an d face - to - face contact between people David S. Bennahum. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 49 Thoughts however go much further. As documented in much modern research on Memes, thoughtforms can become like viruses of the mind. They can spread throughout groups, fam i- lies, nations and indeed the world and are passed through the deeper levels of the unconscious we all experience. Rumours, tales , urban myths are all memes or thoughtforms, while they may be primarily past via the printed word, internet, media etc, there i s a time when they reach a certain “saturation point” and then become part of the collective unconscious. This is exce p- tionally dangerous as negative and violent forms can control groups and crowds creating mob violence and aggression. These groups minds are really thoughtforms out of control. If we r e- turn to the image of Satan for a moment, we may remember that the image of Satan in the Old Testament is primarily that of the t ester, the “devils advocate” rather than one of an evil being. In the New Testament, however, things are different. The term Satan is used to describe pe o- ple (Jesus calls Peter Satan and says “get behind me”), groups (Jesus says the father of the Jews is the devil) and is describe d as plural (legion). If we consider this model carefully we start to realize that the New Testament Satan is not the tester of the Old Testament, but is “bad mind”. That is Satan is negative thoughtforms. These forms exist in an individual (Peter’s weakness) or collectively (the idea of ownership and control which tempted Jesus as he looked over the cities – “all this can b e yours”). It is legion as there are multitudes of Archons both dwelling within our minds and within the collective unconscious. The question of the devil being the father of the Jews takes us into the darker reaches of A r- chon theory, because not only can they exist in the unconscious collective mind but they can create a breach into the astral wor lds through which fallen spiritual entities can then move into the earthly spheres and control the thoughtforms created. These f orms as known in the Gnostic Tradition as Archons, they are the products of mankind enlivened by fallen spirits and fed by our o wn emotions. They can control and influence individuals, collectives even nations and governments. Jesus decried the “Jews” not because of racial prejudice but because the Judaic community of that period had become fundamentalist and literalist, they had l ost the esoteric core of their tradition. In becoming so extreme they had created a destructive thought form which they were fee ding. In Gnostic literature these Archons can so increase in power that they become Dominions, forces which control whole groups of people even races and cou n- tries. So while the Jewish people thought they were worshipped the IAM, they were actually feeding a false god, an Archon they had created from their own ignorance. This happens all too often and why the esoteric tradition is so imperative. Without the gu idance of Gnosticism and esotericism, many will be caught within the web of exoteric (outer) religion. Fundamenta l- ism, cults, literalism, extremism are all products of incorrect readings of the spiritual tradition. When these groups develop their thoughtforms take on a life of their own and not being co n- nected to the “real” energies of the Great Chain of Being they soon sour and become a nexus for the manifestation of fallen enti ties from the astral worlds. These fallen spirits work out of step with the universe and invigorate these forms so that they bec ome independent, discrete fields of energy within the astral world (Archons). They grow from Archons to Dominions and rule from their astral kingdoms. Their poor and unfortunate worshippers think they are follo w- ing the “true god” but are actually feeding monsters created from mans suffering and ign o-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 50 rance. Many of these forms feed on suffering, while others feed on pleasure, they amplify the emotions of their members to gain more and more sustenance. In some sense they are truly “spiritual vampires” and without esotericism, all religions and tradition s succumb. ( They took.... )The name of those that are good and gave it to those that are not good, so that through the names the y might deceive him (mankind) and bind those to those that are not good. Nag Hammadi Gospel of Phillip 54:18 - 25. The imagery o f Archons is very strong in Gnostic literature and because it has become mixed with tales of cosmological dualism many have come to believe that the Archons are the result of a cosmic error or fall. The reality, as discussed earlier, is that there was no g reat cosmic error, just a misperception caused by ignorance. Yet at the same time this ignorance has created a doorway through w hich fallen forms can enter and these Archons or whatever we call them which keep us from appreciating our own misperceptions. I ndeed, it is through our permission that they enter the earth sphere. This is the idea which gave birth to the fall of man tradi tion. Since man in his ignorance created fallen thought forms and allowed fallen e n tities to enter into the earth stream then ultimately man is responsible for the present co n- d i tion of his planet, his culture and his soul. The issue of Archons is complex for there is an interaction between our own tho ught forms and real fallen astral entities. These fields (probably a better description than forms) allow these entities to interface with our own unconscious. Accordingly they can change form a c- cording to the language of the culture they communicate though and being a mixture of our own thoughtforms and “fallen” spirits can mimic our own hidden desires and needs. While in Medieval periods we may have has demons, incubus and succubus, in the prese nt we have aliens, UFO abductions and medical experiments by creatures we cannot see. In the modern mode, these Archons are some times called “ultraterrestrials”. However we must realize that these forms are spiritual in origin. Sure, they may be other races within our universe, assu r- edly so, but it does seem that the majority of UFO sightings and experience reflect our own fears, terrors, needs and desires an d hence have a Archonic origin. The world is the work of lowly powers which though they may mediately be descended from Him do not know the true God and obstruct the knowledge of Him in the cosmos over which they rule. The genesis of these lower powers, the Archons, and in general that of all of the Orders of being outside God, i n- cluding the world itself, is the main theme of Gnostic speculation....The un i- verse, the domain of the Archons is like a vast prison whose innermost du n- geon is the earth, the scene of mans life. Around and above it the cosmic spheres are ranged like concentric enclosing shells.

The Gnostic Religion, Hans Jonas. So when we read a description of Gnosticism such as that found in the classic text The Gno s- tic Religion by Hans Jonas, we must appreciate that the seeming cosmic dualism is actually a dualism between the real and the un real, between the light of the higher worlds and forces which have been created through ignorance. They are like “monsters from the Id”, they seem real enough and since the physical world is shaped and formed by our perceptions, they are for all intents an d purposes real. The only way for us to escape Hiemarmene (universal fate) is to realize that we have created the prison bars ou rselves. What a tragic world this is, he reflected.

This is one of the major problems with the Archons we cr e- ate, they attract forms and spirits which are in ignorance and hence follow them. The Battle Within This model becomes more c omplex when we start to consider its full ramifications. If the watchers interbred with mankind and produced giants, then this i s bizarre enough. However, if their hanged genetic make up (due to their fall) has mixed with ours then mind is a mixture of two lifestreams. This mixture is found hinted at in all literature, in Norse mythology we are a mixture of the giants and the brea th of Odin, in some schools of Gnosticism were are a mixture of Pre - Adamite and Adamite stock, in others, we are a mixture of th e soil of the earth and the divine breath. This biological conflict is important as it explains why we have such di f ferent models of experience. There is so much evidence for mans violence and destructiv e- ness, way even beyond that of the animal kingdom and yet also so much evidence for mans love, beauty and transcendence. In Gnostic terms this is because there are two fields of infl u- ence, the Static (Pleroma) and the Dialectic (Archon). These fields pull us towards the light and towards matter. The drive towards matter is necessary but has been overlaid with the art i- f i cial desires and drives of the fallen forms. Hence, the Dialectic field is based on a invol u- tio n ary necessity, but actually works against us. It is important to see what this clash is not, it is not a clash between body and spirit and matter and spirit. Matter has its place and is a necessary teacher, the clash is between spirit (Static fields) and the artificial forms created by the watchers and ultimately by ignorance.

While there is certainly no ontol ogical or intrinsic evil, there are things which appear evil and things which can become evil. To summarize; 1. There is no cosmol ogical or ontological evil. Saturn is a tester and may seem evil (perceptional dualism), but this is a problem of perspective. W hile disease and death may seem “evil,” in the greater picture they are not. There are many “partial” spirits (such as fire spri tes etc) which can only work in a restricted way and hence can appear evil only because we do not understand their limited focus and purpose. 2. Ethical evil is created through ignorance (which creates attachments to matter, greed, etc etc). This can infect not only human but spirit beings of varying degrees. Hence there can be angels, demons etc which are “destructive” but this is of ignorance not out of cosmological design. 3. Since thoughts have power, mans ignorance has dire effec ts. It is capable of creating thought vibrations which congregate in the collective unconscious and then if given enough power can move into the lower astral plane. These forms (Archons and Domi n- ions etc) also collect ignorant astral forms and create principalities within the Astral world. These Archons then, in turn, inf luence and control man and his civilization. 4.

While it may have first appeared with the Renaissance and humanist philosophy, it was the industrialisation of the West and the advent of Darwinian which really set the ball rol l- ing. Progress as a philosophy has become so deeply ingrained in both the sciences and arts that that any modern study within bot h fields accepts as a foundation a belief in evolutionism (both physical and cultural). The traditional view of history is at variance with this approach, it is i n- evitably cyclic and emphasises the ebbs and flows of culture. While the cycle may return to i t- self, the focus is on decline rather than on development. Within the Norse traditions the gods are ultimately destroyed at Ragno rak and a new cycle of manifestation, conflict and resolution begins. While within Gnosticism the Omega Day ends the cycle and a “new heaven and new earth” begins. The Vedic system outlines this cycle in far more detail, the whole of creation is governed b y a series of cyclic processes, these range from the Days and Nights of Brahma (the creative force) to the Yugas or epochs. The Sanskrit names for the four ages are Krita or Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga. The Krita or Satya Yuga is th e Golden Age, the age of Spirit and it is from here that things get successively worse until the Kali age, which ends in an apoc alypse of water and fire. Each age in succession is shorter than its predecessor, is more intense, and more material. The Kali a ge is the shortest, most materialistic and intensely destructive. It is this age we are in now. The Kali Yuga, or Iron Age is sometimes described as the Age of the Wolf, due to its ferocity and vi o- lence. There are many different dating systems, but according to the Mahabharata, the Kali Yuga started on the midnight of 17th and 18th February, 3102 BCE and represents the final stage of the cycle. It is interesting that this date coincides with the sta rt of the 5 th Sun period of the Mayans, which they believe climaxes in 2012. \"All kings occupying the earth in the Kali Age wil l be wanting in tranquility, strong in anger, taking pleasure at all times in lying and dishonesty, inflicting death on women, children, and cows, prone to take the paltry possessions of ot h- ers, with character that is mostly Tamas, rising to power and soon falling.

So whi le the age may be dark, there is wisdom for those who seek. While the Vedic, Indo - European, Biblical and Greek traditions may be primarily of a traditional religious nature, the concept of decline is also found within the work of many great historians, so much so that many speak of the school of historical pessimism. In some way the major figure within this school was Oswald Sp engler. Historical Models of Cyclic Time Oswald Spengler was born in 1880 in Blankenburg, Germany and educated at the universiti es of Halle, Munich, and Berlin. On the basis of his extensive studies in mathematics, science, hi s- tory, philosophy, and art, he formulated a philosophical system that offered an explanation of the history of human culture. In his single important work, The Decline of the West (1918 - 1922, revised ed. 1923;), Spengler attempted to prove that each civiliz ation possesses a unique \"soul\" and style of art and thought, and that all cultures pass through a life cycle of birth, growth, decay and death comparable to the biological cycle of living organisms. In his analysis of the history of Western Europe, Spengler argued that the culture of Europe had entered the final stage of its existence that was to be chiefly a period of tech nological and political expansion. His other works include The Cr u cial years (1933) and Man and Technics (1931). The nexus of Spengler’s work is that history is not a mechanical series of events, but represents the outward manifestation of a much deeper process. History, accor d ing to Spengler, is organic and moves through cycles of summer, spring, autumn and winter. These cycles are akin to life periods and there is much in common with Jung’s view regarding racial memory, arch e types and forms. Races and nations have colle c- tive minds and hence ope r ate on a deeper level than individuals, they cannot be reduced to ec o nomic or class processes alone. These organic cycles of decline are i m portant as they bring the Yugas into a more hi s- torical and academic vein. Spengler does not describe the great cycles of the ages (as the Yugas represent in a macrocosmic aspe cts), yet his"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 58 individual civilisations all work through mini - Yugas which he represents as organic national seasons. While there will always b e debate about the particulars of Spengler’s work its place within the traditional understanding of history cannot be denied. The ramifications of an organic view of civilization are very relevant to the Gnostic. If cu l- tures are like a human body, for example, then we can suggest that its various parts have di f- fe r ing levels of importance, ability and significance, and that to reduce all aspects of the \"body\" of the \"organic\" society to an equal footing would be like suggesting the head is equal to the arm, the appendix to the eyes. This basic inequality is a founda tion stone of the unique vision of Gnosticism which emphasizes individual spiritual development over a vast number of lives. To really appreciate the esoteric and religious significance of these cycles we need to consider two major figures and their outlin es of the sacred cycle – Rene Guenon and Julius Evola. Rene Guenon and Julius Evola Guenon is not a man who liked the press, he was a bitter critic of the cult of personality and avoided worthless shows of ego. While Guenon would have avoided offering any biographical details, I think that at least some background is in order. Rene Guenon was born on the 15 th N o vember 1886 to an architect father, his family owned a vineyard which was passed to his younger brother as it was obvious Rene had a flair for the academic but was not gifted in e i- ther the arts or winemaking. Moving to Paris in his youth he had contact with many occult o r- ganizations, becoming a student of Papus for a period. By 1912 he had become an initiated Sufi and became deeply immersed in the esoteric of both Hinduism and Islam. After the death of his wife in the 1930's he left to spend the rest of his life in isolati on in Cairo, rejected the modern world. He again married and live with his Egyptian wife under the name Abdel W a- hed Yahi. He died on the 7th January 1951. Guenon's earliest works are meant to clear the way for a real appraisal of esotericism and Gn o sis, they are bitter and incisive attacks on both Theosophy and Spirit u a l ism. These two works offer an insightful r e- je c tion of the syncretism and bourgeois indulgence that had become the occult movements of the period. He documents the stupidities and extremes of both mov e ments and intimates that it is not the spirits of the dead who are co m m u nicating with spiritualists but subversive forces. He believes that these forces of Counter Gnosis and Anti - tradition were offering Counter - Initiations in an attempt to degrade the real and essential Gn o sis. When the assault against Counter Gnosis was completed Guenon turned his gaze to the very soul of Western Man. In Orient and Occ i dent (1924), Crisis of the Modern World (1927 and The reign of Quantity and the Sign of the Times (1953) he lays bare the Western soul and documents the clear signs of our d e-"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 59 ge n eration and collapse. These works are uncompromising and offers a critique of the destru c- tion modernism is perpetuating on our society, he demands a return to real esotericism as o p- posed to the false \"feel good\" cults of his time. Guenon however was not all assault and warfare, his metaphysical works show a great mind which can see to the very heart of esotericism. Certainly his writing on symbolism are hard g o- ing, titles such as the Symbolism of the Cross (1931), Fundamental Symbols (1962) and Mult i- ple States of Being (1932) are not easy reading. They demand a concentration which, I am afraid, many modern minds fed on comput er games and TV will find difficult. However the sheer intellectual exhilaration one can gain from mastering them cannot be easi ly forgotten. Guenon also published hundreds of book reviews in such journals as Le Voile D’Isis and Etudes Traditionnelles, spe wing forth venom mixed with insight in such a form that it has never been repeated again. While his critiques of modern forms ar e noteworthy and relevant, at times there is a tendency to turn a molehill into a mountain and throw the baby out with the bathw a- ter. For example, while Jung’s disciples certainly twisted Gnosticism and Alchemy totally out of proportion it is probably unfai r to turn the knife on Jung himself. However, in the end we have to realize Guenon was very aware of how the media worked and hence by providing e x- pl o sive, venomous and virulent reviews they were guaranteed publication and they were always read and hence, in that sense, they ha d their effect. Whether you liked what he said or not, you were effected by what he wrote and considered his message. Guenons v iew of history is that it is comprised of a series of cycles, these he takes directly from the Vedic tradition. In practise this means that history is a record of degeneration. Accordingly, since the earliest times man has been sinking deeper and deeper in to the mire of matter. While view is not popular with materialists and secularists, it is nevertheless the key focus of Gu e- non’s work. In his magnum opus \" The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times \", Guenon succinctly outlines the process of spi ritual degeneration. As man thinks he is evolving, he is si m ply accelerating his own destruction - living standards and technology may advance, but only at the cost of spirit. This metaphy sical entropy causes matter to become successively more physical, more solid, and on a spiritual level - more malefic. Society becomes centred on glo b- a l ism (witness the New World Order), rather than on nations and individuals and there is an e m phasis on scientific advances rather than simplicity. As we reach the later phases of this d e- generation (the present period), anti - traditions and forms of anti - gnosis arise purporting to be of spiritual value. The most da ngerous facet of this process is how, in the darkest age, fissures will appear in the barrier between the physical world and the lower astral planes, and there will be an intrusion of the malefic inhabitants of this inferior subtle domain. This strange and dark prophecy as found in is also a key to a deeper understanding of the real nature of Aquarius. While the new - agers claim it will be an age of love and mung - beans, since the ruler of Aquarius is Saturn, we can e x pect a bumpy ride first. While Saturn is also the lord of the Golden Age (the Satya Yuga), this emphasises the dual nature of th e planetary daemon, tester, destroyer and guardian of the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 60 Garden of Eden. The key philosophical emphasis within Guenon’s historical analysis is on the duality of quantity and quality, q uality being the character of the Golden age (and indeed the principle of Gold – see our discussions of this later) and quantity , the Kali Yuga attribute. Whether it be the decay of the nature of currency, or the clash between craftsmanship and the rule of the machine, this cycle of decay can be seen within the class between quantity and qua l ity. Indeed, many modern criticisms of technology such as those of Neil Postman have a strong Guenonian ring. Evola and \"The Rev olt against the Modern World\" Julius Evola was the most notable representative of the traditionalist position, he was also co n- sidered one of the most erudite authorities on Hermeticism and Magic. This did nothing to r e- duce the great controversy that surrounds him. Julius Cesare Andrea Evola was born in Rome in 1898 to an aristocratic family of Sicilian origin. His child - hood was marked by intelligence close to genius and he quickly learned many languages. He read widely in German, French and Italian. He be - came involved with both the Dada and futurist movements and was consi d- ered a promising artist. He served with honour during World War I in a regiment of mountain artillery and survived the war to co ntinue his search for meaning. He made contact with Arturo Reghini (1878 - 1946) who was the co - ordinator of the UR group which st udied speculative Freemasonry, occultism, and other occult traditions, it had a strong interest in the work of Rene Guenon. Evola’s natural aristocracy came to the surface and he became the learning exponent of the d e- veloping philosophy of the UR (and its successor KRUR) group. Evola and the UR group b e- came aligned to the natural principles of aristocracy and while not having a necessarily high opinion of Mussolini, realised the pragmatic value of his revolution and gave him their support in print. Evola’s early work (Pagan Imperialism) attacked the debilitating effects of Christia n- ity as it was represented in the period and upheld the heroic virtues of Rome. This work and r e lated articles caused controversy throughout Italy. Later Evola founded La Torre (the Tower), his own magazine, however, due to conflict with the prevailing state it only last ten i s- sues. His works slowly started to move towards the spiritual side of politics and he made it clear that the only real return to \"traditional esoteric values\" can occur when we ourselves are transformed. In 1945 he was hit by a stray bomb and paralysed from the waist down, he spent the rest of his life writing, researching and offering guidance to those seeking a spir i tual revolution. He died in 1974. His writing are pr o- fuse yet most are not as yet translated into English, it seems there is a great fear regarding the explosive nature of his insightful vision. Evola was not afraid of o f fending peoples foibles or attacking their sacred cows. He attempted to unite politics, occultism, religion and traditionalism i nto a \"world shattering\" vision and he had remarkable success."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 61 For Evola, history was a series of cycles that are degenerative rather than evolutionary, we are then in the darkest age of all (the Kali Yuga), rather than entering an age of light, love and peace. Our modern way of thinking is, (according to Evola) a was teland, it is the final stage in the decay of truth, rather than its pinnacle. History from this perspective is a series of \"ste ps down - ward\" whereby new religious and esoteric systems are fragments of the truth rather than being new innovations or develop ments. Evola’s magnum opus, \" Revolt against the modern world \", slices through the false theosophies, new age visions and pseudo - intellectual systems so prevalent today and offers insight into the real nature of man, his history and his goals. The a p- proach of Evola is elitist in the sense that it is intellectually and spiritually demanding, Evola d e mands maximum concentration from his readers, however, in return he offers a worldview, a Weltanschauug that challenges the foun dations of currently held beliefs. The nexus of Evola’s \" Revolt against the modern world \" is a exposition on the cycles of hist ory and a intense and insightful consideration of the role of esoteric spiritual values. Evola’s hi s- torial outline takes the Yugas a step further, he discusses the cultural focus of each period and the changes that take places w ithin the ideological and spiritual traditions of each epoch. The Golden age is that of the Polar tradition, it was based in the Arctic regions where days and nights were long and the Axis Mundi was a steady focus within the night sky. At this time the traditions of Sky and Earth worship were in balance, while the sky had ascendancy, the role of earth (albeit in submission) was acknowledged and relevant. The classes as seen within the d i- vine caste system (which reflected the ages of history) were in balance and creativity and inte l- l i gence were rewarded. As the Polar age ended and migrations from the Arctic were caused by changes in weather patterns, Aryan man spread across the globe and mankind entered the Silver age. During the Silver or Lunar epoch, earth cults took ascendancy, the feminine and fertility b e came of paramount significance and this lead to an emphasis on pagan and Gaia oriented tr a- ditions. The research of Marija Gimbutas and others gives a good outline of the worship that o c curred in this period. As the ages unfounded, in reaction against this earthly epoch, the Di o- n y sian or Copper age began. The worship of strength, violence, masculine virtues battle against the feminine values and patriarcha l civilisations were formed. While these civilisations were of great historical importance, to achieve their balance they suppre ssed the lunar or silver cultures and hence existed as a reaction rather than as a creative expression. This being so, it only t ook so long before the clashes between the two forces dragged man into the current age, that of the Kali Yuga. Now lunar and Dio nysian, feminine and masculine, sky and earth are in conflict and battle and will continue so until the age ends in bloodshed. Evola decried the decadent nature of the modern world and its social and political isms and ol o- gies and demanded a return to old world values, which he felt were epitomised by the Teutonic Knights, knights who could act as spiritual warriors waging war against the whole corrupt bou r- geois modern system. This concept of spiritual warriorship he elucidated most clearly in his radically revisionist book on Buddh ism – \"The Doctrine of Awakening\". In the Doctrine of Awakening Evola offers a radical re - assessment of Buddhism and indeed of"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 62 the path to completeness. He argues than the modern monastic approach of Buddhism is alien to Gautama’s original intent and suggests that Buddhism was originally a path of action. Accor d- ingly Evola sees the primal form of Buddhism as centred on a warrior/priest rather than on a monk. He uses emphasizes the role o f Aristocracy but in a unique Evolian sense. The term Aristocrat here is used in its strictest etymological sense, coming from t he Greek word Aristos meaning best. The Buddhist disdain for talking about self and God comes not from di s- belief, Evola argues, but from a demand for action. There is no Self, so create one, there is no God, so become one. This approach is certainly at odds with much that passes for modern Bu d- dhism and yet in these days of navel gazing and armchair occultism, one cannot help but be e x- hilarated by his call to arms. But a simple call is not all of Evola’s message, he does not leave us with theory alone. The Doct rine of Awakening re - evaluates the basic tenets of Buddhism and ex - amines them in light of the warrior - priest ethos. Rather than advocating a negative detac h- ment whereby life is experienced at an arms distance, Evola suggests we experience detachment by \"riding the tiger\", by flowing with the punches, rather than against them. There is no life - denying here, more a transcendence achieved amidst the chaos. At th e same time, Evola does not wish to see partial. His approach is that there are many ways to \"ride the tiger\", one can ride slow ly and with care, or struggle into the night, one can beat it into submission or lull it with song. Evola other published works, the Yoga of Power and The Hermetic Tradition offer var i- ous interpretations of the means to achieve the Aristocratic Self. Evola’s worship of the Heroic brings us full circle, it brin gs us back to the Yugas and the Greek model with its trans=temporal Heroic age. The Age of Heroes in the Greek system exists ou t- side the time based cycle of Gold, Silver, Copper and Iron, it is that call to go beyond the nat u- ral entropy of the cycles and achieve greatness. In Evola’s system it is the true Solar path, the path of the Sun which leads ba ck to the Axis Mundi, the Polar Golden Age. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 63 The Great Year The concept of precession is central to the cycle known as the Great or Platonic Year. It is based on the simple fact that the earth does not “sit straight”, there is a slight wobble in the earth’s axis as it spins. Accordingly the North Po le describes a circle taking 2590 years to reach the point at which it started. As this process unfolds the Vernal Equinox is se en to move backwards through the signs. This backwards movement starts at Capricorn and ends at Aquarius, the reverse of the nor mal yearly cycle. Many have argued that it was Hipparchus in the second century BCE who discovered this, however there is clear evidence that it was known far earlier to the Mayans and Egyptians. This cycle is the basis of many different systems of mytho logy, De Santillana and Von Dechend argue in “Hamlets Mill” that the “Great Year” may indeed be the basis for most co s mological systems. The Gnostic tradition suggests that this great cycle was known to the Atlanteans and was encoded into the rit uals and architecture of Ancient Egypt. Accordingly, the role of the Pharaoh and later the priesthood had a special significance in relation to the u n folding of the great year. The Egyptian Star Gnosis and the rite of Rebirth The central focus of Egyptian ritualism was the Gr eat Pyramid, it was connected to the Sphinx and operated as a initiatory structure. The Pyramid was identified with the Sanctuar y of the Sun and embodied Ra, the Solar Logos. The rites undertaken in the Chamber of the King and Queen were rites of rebirth w hereby the Pharaoh became identified with the Solar Sphere. He mediated the energies of the Logos and hence accelerated the posi tive current and sublimated or transformed the negative. The Sun like the planets and zodiac was a doorway between the spiritual and physical worlds and hence emanated forces from the Pleroma and from the worlds of the Archons. During the rite of rebirth the Pharaoh left his body and tra v- eled through the heavens. He jou r neyed through the realms of the planets and zodiac using passwords, gestures and codes, only after successfully passing the spheres could he then nav i- gate through the great barrier and enter the Pleroma. This ri t- ual form was connected to the Egyptian astro - Gnosis and i n- volved the Pharaoh becoming the mediator for his people. In Chapter Six: Chapter Six: The Gnostic Concept The Gnostic Concept Of Time II Of Time II"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 64 this role he also prepared Egypt for the change which took place at the “Equinox of the Gods”, when one astrological sign gave way to another. For 180 years before this event the Pharaoh and priesthood would work creating new symbols, mythologies and astral vessels so that the i n- coming energy could be utilized for the benefit of Egypt. As time progressed the Egyptian Star - Gnosis, the Divine rite of Rebirth and the secret of Plan e- tary and Zodiacal mediation was passed from the Pharaoh to a separate priesthood. With time and changes in both state and religi on, the teachings were held under oath by secret orders and brotherhoods. Even within the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn we can find elements of the mediation rite within its equinox rituals, however, the emphasis has changed to emanating the forces on ly for those linked to the Order and hence joined to its “group mind”. As we head further into the Kali Yuga it is the individua ls task to use and transform the heavenly energies within him or herself. It is important to realize that Energies the Zodiac l ike those of the Planets are ambivalent, they receive and relay forces of both positive and negative nattier. In a more medieval context, they are said to possess both Spirits and Intelligences. The Gnostic tradition has always been unsure of astrology and see the heavenly forces as energies which must be reckoned with, not Gods to be worshipped. The present change of cycle is tha t movement from Pisces to Aquarius, while there is some variation in the dating it is generally accepted that Aquarius will dawn around 2024 with some margin of error. (Astrologers fluctuate the dating of the age of Aquarius from between the year 2000 to a round 2100). At the change of each sign there is much transformation, for example, the change from Aries to Pisces at approximat ely 6 BCE triggered a wide range of spiritual manifestations. It would be possible to link Zoroaster, Gautama Buddha and Jesus/J ames all into the nexus of the movement from Aries to Pisces. Indeed the imagery of Pisces as the fish has much in common with J esus and early Christianity. In Egyptian mythology Horus is also sometimes seen as the fisherman. There are many ways to image t he astrological ages, in one Egypt tradition Isis is related to Taurus, Osiris to Aries, Horus to Pisces and Maat to Aquarius. The start of the Pyramid age was linked to Leo and many believe that the Sphinx was carefully ligned to the image of Leo at the horizon, while it forms embodied the Priestess of Virgo and the form of the Lion as it represented the change from one astrolog ical age to the next (Virgo to Leo). Heraldic Cycles The Platonic year is 25,920 years long and hence each sign cover 2160 yea rs. Each of these signs can be further sub - divided into minor precessional cycles, each of which is 180 years long. In each astr ological age the first minor cycle is of the same characteristic as that of the greater, hence in Pisces, the first minor cycle of 180 years was that of Pisces of Pisces. The last age of the minor cycle is important as it is preparation for the changeover to the next age. This"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 65 cycle is known as the “Equinox of the Gods”, in the present cycle (Pisces), is began in 1844 and is ruled by Aries. In the Egyptian initiatory traditions this period was also known as the Hera l- dic cycle, it was the period in which the priesthood prepared the symbolism, legends and ve s- sels for the influx of energy which would occur at the changeover to the new cycle. The cycle itself encompasses four different co - ordinates, these can be related to the four letters of the d i- vine name (YHVH), the four elements, the four Canopic Jars of mummification and the four phases of the Temple.

The general style of Egyptian Temples includes a Great Court, Vestibule, Hypostyle Hall and the Great Seat. This design was later adapted into what became the Israelite Sanctuary and Kings Solomon’s Temple. In general, the Egyptian Temple was surrounded by a massive wall of mud - brick. This wall is o- lated the Temple from it surroundings, which symbolically represented the forces of Chaos. Metaphorically the mud resulted from the union of heaven and earth. The brick wall itself was therefore set in wavy courses to symbolize the primeval waters, represe nting the first stage of creation. The exterior walls of the Temple resembled a fortress, so as to defend it against all forms of evil. The Temple was entered through two pylons, beyond which lay an open court. This court sometimes had colonnades along the sides and an altar in the middle. Next, along the temple - axis came the hypostyle, a pillared hall often surrounded by small rooms which are used for the storage of Temple equipment and for other secondary purposes. Finally, there was the sanctuary, w hich was a dark room containing the shrine, where the figure of the Neter was placed. The san c-"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 66 t u ary’s doors were shut and sealed all year long and were open only for the great festivals. The Sanctuary was called the Great Se at. Historical Deception: The Untold Story of Ancient Egypt Moustafa Gadalla Bastet Publishing, 1996. The Temple symbolized the fourfold process which took place both within the Heavens and the activity taken by the priesthood in their ritual activities. It has a specific application within our description of the process of cosmic mediation in the Heraldic cycle. If you telescope the imagery you could image a High Priest moving through the stages of the Temple, each stage representing a period of activity in which the priesthood has been working and preparing. As he completes each stage it would represent a aspects of the Heraldic period, only at the m o- ment of the movement from one age to the next would he enter the Sanctuary and transit the energies to the priesthood and to Eg ypt. To fully appreciate the Heraldic cycle as it leads towards Aquarius, we should examine the four dates at the climax of Pis ces. From 18444 to 21024 we have the Piscean Heraldic cycle ruled by the sign of Aries. Aries is ruled by the planet Mars and he nce this suggests the violent and martial tone that Pisces, which is assigned the Egyptian God Horus, has taken in this last age. While Pisces is water, Aries is Fire and hence we have the interaction of Will and Em o- tion, while Pisces distributes power, Aries generates it and hence the combination of these powers brings great changes. The at tribution of Horus to Pisces is controversial and will raise the hackles of the disciples of Aliester Crowley who believe the Ae on of Horus began with his revelation in 1904.I do not aim to debate the Gnostic versus Thelemite position here, the linked docu ment will cover that in some detail if you want further information. The classic Gnostic position is to align Isis with Taurus, Taurus being the earth goddess, Osiris is assigned to Aries and it the imagery of the sacrifice of rams to the Father God are th roughout that period. Horus is Pisces, the imagery is related to Jesus as the Fisherman, the ocean of mankind, the fish as Chris tian symbols is also founder as a symbol of Horus as Fisherman. Horus as a semi - solar image is found throughout religions of that period, Christianity representing the misapplication of Horus to become a vi o- lent martial force. Maat is Aquarius, the outpouring of truth and Gnosis. The first date in our Heraldic cycle is 1844, it is t he initiation whereby the process of change from Pisces to Aquarius began. There are many other hidden indicators of this date, in the Bi b- lical tradition there are specific prophecies that focus on this date. The 2300 year prophecy of the cleansing of the Sanctuary, began in 457 BCE with the declaration of Artaxeres to restore Jerusalem and ended in 1844. The prophecy focused on the Solar Sa nctuary and the climax of it is when the sanctuary is transformed when the priest enters the innermost realm (the sacred Seat). Some references include Daniel 8:14 and 9:25. The 2520 (7 Times) Prophecy focused"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 67 on the loss of the Ten Tribes of Israel to history and the description of their re - awakening to the Gnosis started in 1844. Thi s period is also known as the time of the Gentiles and is referenced in Leviticus 26 and under the guise of the prophecy of the seven times. 1844 as a trigger point for the Heraldic cycle is also interesting as many religions view this as an important dat e, the Adventists (and other protestant sects) of the period preached throughout American that Jesus was returning and a great disappointment occurred due to a misunderstan d- ing of this prophecy. Modern groups deriving from the Adventists including Seventh Day A d- ventists and Branch Davidians continue to believe that this date was significant and teach that in 1844 Jesus entered the “Holy of Holies” in the Israelite Temple and began an investigative judgment of the Dead. During the period from 1844 to an unspecifie d date the Angels of the Book of Revelation will unveil their messages and mankind will go through great tribulations heading to wards the Second Coming of Jesus. This theology while in a language different from the Egyptian Heraldic cycle is basically identical. The energy of Christ can be related to the S o- lar force which meditates the astrological cycles and hence we can easily relate the quasi - Christian imagery to the esoteric tra dition. 1904 as the transmission period of the heraldic cycle certainly is expressive. Aliester Crowley declared that in 1904 A iwass, a being he claimed was a secret Chief or master, revealed that a new age was dawning. The matter is made more complex as Crowley interpreted this to mean that the Aeon of Horus had began in 1904. However, from a Gnostic perspective this is unlikely. The Aeon of Horus was the Age of Pisces and Crowley had experienced a further transmission of the energy which was be coming Aquarius. At the same time this energy re - stated much of the teachings of the Solar Tradition since it had become garbled through the ages. However, since this knowledge was filtered through Crowley’s unconscious, difficulties arise. The current of 93 he outlined is the Piscean current, Agape (Love), Thelema (Will) and Logos (word) all are aspects of it and 93 reduces to 12 - the Zodiac and of course the twelve di s ciples, twelve being the sacred number of completion within Biblical numerology. There are many difficulties as Crowley disciple s transformed his Gnostic vision into a counter culture cult. The relevance is in Crowley declaration of the revelation. Further activity of this period i n- clude Jehovah’s Witnesses who still believe Jesus returned (in spirit) during this period (1914 in some groups but the dates var y). Many other denominations also follow this revelation, so the acceleration of the current certainly has resonance among many traditions. The World Wars that occurred during this period could also be considered ramifications of mankind fighting against the transformation current and the Counter - Gnosis moving into the political dimension. As the energies change the activities of the Dominions and Principalities intensify. 1964 was the consolidation of the current in the sense that it as the energies ac celerated society was pushed to the limit. The result being the opening up of the collective psyche which brought about every po ssible extreme, politically, sexually, emotional and spiritually.

However, do not expect it to be all love and light. Aquarius is ruled by Saturn or Uranus, depending on whether you use the modern attributions. Saturn is both the Demiurge and the divine purifier, Uranus is the lord of the Abyss or great barrier between the Pleroma and the lower world. Aquarius will be an age of great ferocity, violence terror as well as growth and transfiguration for those who seek the light. One of the images associated with Aquarius is the Peacock. T he peacock was the sacred image of the Yeizidi, a Islamic people who followed an ancient Gnostic religious tradition. The Pe a- cock was Melek Taus who can be related to the Demiurge (our projections regarding matter), but at the same time the eyes of the peacock (Eye=Ayin in Hebrew, the Devil Tarot Card) show us that ultimately dualism has no power, no reality and hence the real s ource is beyond in the Pleroma and the Invisible spirit. "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Gnostic Identity Message What we know as the Gnostic identity message is central to our understanding of the Gnostic tradit ion. It is difficult to summarise such a complex subject as it demands an extensive study of the evolution of religion, history and politics to grasp its meaning and even further thought to consider its ramifications. However, we need to at least examine s ome of the basic concepts on which the Gnostic identity message is founded. The crux of the Gnostic Identity message is a radic al re - interpretation of history. From our pe r spective this re - interpretation is actually a return to the original essence of the Gnostic tr a- d i tions. To appreciate these re - interpretations it is imperative to consider the Bible in its orig i- nal languages and in the context of the religious ideologies that prevailed at the period it was written. It is also imperative to understand the big picture which shows where the tradition originated and to consider the nature of Israel and the Gnostic vi ew of Christianity Origins To suggest a common denominator between Gnosticism, Kabbalah, Medieval Occultism and Nordic and Vedic Sources is to court disaster, at least in the eyes of modern scholarship. Ho w- ever, if we examine the research of those who laid the foundations for modern archaeology and anthropology, there is much eviden ce for a direct link between these divergent forms, (even perhaps evidence of a single source or point of origin). If we take Kabbalah, for exa m- ple, today promoted as Judaic Mysticism when we examine the scholarly texts on its origins (both by Jewish and non - Jewish source s), they all tend to agree that the Kabbalah had it roots in Greek and Hellenistic philosophy, Gnosticism and Alexandrian Hermeticism, and furthe r- more, that it was only later adapted by Judaic sources. An authority as respected as Gershom Scholem clearly suggests a strong Greek influence, if not Greek origin for the Kabbalah. I n- deed he posits the key Kabbalistic glyph of the Tree of Life as having obvious Greek and Gno s tic origins. Nag Hammadi texts such as the Secret Book of John and the writings of the Valentinian Gnostic sect all elucidate a hierarchical structure which could be seen as a precu r- sor to later Kabbalistic glyphs and figures. If in turn we take our exploration further and give due consideration to the origi ns of Greek philosophy and esotericism, an Egyptian influence can be seen clearly on both Pythagoras and Plato. Such scholars as Heinrich Schliemann, have noted the similarity between Greek and Vedic forms and suggested a common place of origin. Similar similarities can be found b e- Chapter Seven: Chapter Seven: The Continuum of the Gnosis The Continuum of the Gnosis"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 70 tween Nordic and Vedic sources and hence as we come to speculate on these links we may b e- gin to conjecture that they are ripples resulting from a stone cast into the primal pool of gnosis. Ripples that have spread out through cultures, traditions and peoples, many of which have fo r- gotten the origins of their legends, tales and philosophy. Julius Evola and many others suggest that this primal culture was based in the Arctic region and due to severe weather changes migr a- tions took place to many diverse locations. While an arctic origin to Vedic culture may seem u n usual to modern scholarship, it is exactly what was argued in The Arctic Home in the Vedas (1903) by Bal Gangadhar Tilak . In th is work Tilak argued for an early origin of Vedic culture in the interglacial period and used detailed astronomical an historical research to prove his thesis. He argued that the earliest r e- cords were from up to 35,000 BCE (very similar to the Pharaoh lists of Manetho, but that the major impetus was circa 10,500 – 8, 000 BCE when after the destruction of the original polar home, migrations began. These continued through the period of 8,000 - 5,000 BCE with settl e- ments through Northern Europe and Asia. It was during the period of 5,000 - 3,000 BCE, which Tilak calls the Orion period, that th e Vedic hymns and sacrificial system were evolved. Other texts evolve between 3,000 and 1,400 when the memory of the original ho meland is dim. This theory is all the more challenging when associated with the latest research in dating the Sphinx and early Egyptian culture. The work of John West (Serpent in the Sky), Bauval & Ha n- cock (Keeper of Genesis, Fingerprints of the Gods, the Orion Mystery) and others have signif i- cantly pushed back the dating of the foundation of Egypt, maybe to even as early as 10,500 BCE. The latest dating of the Sphinx has a major effect on how we evaluate history. From geological research by Prof. Robert Schloch of Boston University, it has be en conclusively proven that the Sphinx shows signs of major erosion from rain - water. The evidence suggests that this level of erosion would have demanded a very different environment from today. When this is coupled with the astrological image that the Sphinx encodes (the Lion head represents Leo), a likely da t- ing is found around 10,500 BCE. This is when the feet of the Sphinx would be aligned with Leo on the Horizon. It also fits well with the erosion evidence. Many see this period, when great cataclysms such as the onset of the last ice age changed the face of the earth and Arctic man was driven to migration as the source from which later sca t- tered esoteric traditions are the reverberations. This polar culture held within it the key perennial wisdom of its people. This tradition was ca r- ried throughout northern Europe and Asia and it is said that many of the early Vedic hymns can be dated from this period of wand ering (5000 - 3000 BCE). However, by the time the later Vedic texts were written, circa 3000 - 1400 BCE, the origins of their tradit ion had been forgotten. Intricately related to the idea of a polar homeland (there is some debate over Arctic versus An t- arctic due to the possibility of a polar shift connected to the ice age) is the work of Rand and Rose Flem - Aeth. In When the Sky Fell, they offer extensive research to show the likelihood of"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 71 the location of the legendary land of Atlantis being one and the same as the Polar Homeland, now covered in ice. It is suggested by Blavatsky (the Secret Doctrines) that it is from this pr i- mal, polar land that various races spread throughout the globe. There is some debate about the exact number of migrations, there is general agreement certainly that major settlements were made in Tibet, India, Sumer/Egypt and South America. It is from the Sumer/Egypt basin that the Israelite Mysteries developed. The Israel Connection Developing from the theory above we have the fascinating studies by Ahmed Osman and ot h- ers. These suggest clearly a direct link between what was supposed to be Judaism and Egypt. This evidence proves, fairly conclus ively in many peoples minds, that Moses and Arkenaten were the same people and that the Israelites were his followers escaping f rom Egypt. This model certainly re - visions the Old Testament as we start to realize that Judaism in this earlier phase had littl e to do with what we see as Rabbinic Judaism today. The evidence is then they d e veloped a large desert culture with an emphasis on a God and a Goddess and that most Old Testament stories were written at a much late date and were distorted by the then fundamenta l- ist and nationalist priesthood.. To appreciate this, we should revisit the Old Testament and see what we can find. El, Yahweh a nd Reconsidering the Bible There is more to the Old Testament than first meets the eye, and its study opens up a Pandora’s box of issues we need to consider. Modern scholars believe that the Old Testament is not a c o- herent whole, when it is subjected to Biblical criticism it is found that there are at least three di f ferent streams of information within it. The El Stream, the Yahwahist Stream and the Priestly Stream. The El Stream is the very earliest, it seems to represent the pagan traditions of Canaan and surroundings. Within this tradition the Gods are known as El or the Mighty Ones, one of the more important is Baal. Associated with these Gods are goddesses, the major being is known as Ath irat. Together Baal and Athirat form the basis of the pagan Canaanite tradition. As Israel became more nationalistic and politic al the El tradition was suppressed. At the same time a fundamentalist and literalist extreme arose within the society and this n ew tradition was the Yahwahist Stream. Yahweh becomes the Mighty One, Baal is vanquished and replaced with the tradition of the coming Warrior Messiah, with the goddess relegated to the shadows. The hi s- tory of Israel is, in some sense, the battle between these two streams or religious traditions and between these two streams and the Gnosis ! In studying the Old Testament we need to realise that it is not the Word of God but a remnant, a historical record of what occurred within Israel at that period. While it contains scraps of the original Mysteries it is not primarily a religio us text, but a mixture of myths, legends, histories and interpretations. While certainly the esoteric keys are found hidden throughout its pages we must also be aware of the distortions of the Gn o- sis that exist within it. The Priestly Stream (that of the Scribe) rightly belongs beyond the Old Testament, it occurred"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 72 after the captivity in Babylon when Yahwehist scribes took control of Diaspora Israel in Bab y- lon and re - moulded Judaism into a new form. This new form was based on literalist and fund a- mentalist not Gnostic values. The Yahwahist tradition was embodied, the El demolished and the Priest class was edited into the O ld Testament to make it seem supreme. The Old Testament, as such, is a very edited book. It was written by a Priest class which existed a long time after the original events, and a class which wanted to destroy the traditional power of the Qadesh (see later discussion of this group) and mould the Yahwahist tradition into a militaristic style cult. This moulded Old Testament, ( combined with the Talmud) became the text of modern Jewry. When the Israelites migrated to other lands after the Assyrian captiv ity they re - established many of the Gnostic traditions. Hence, the Druids and those of the Celtic faith probably had more in com mon with the original Israelite Gnosis that modern Judaism and Christianity. We can see how the struggle between various divergent traditions has been edited into the Old te s- t a ment, Joseph’s Coat of many colours, for example, a Sumerian symbol of a Qadesh priest b e- came a simple piece of clothing. Baal has been demonised to become the enemy of the people of Israel yet we know that the early Priests of Israel actually accepted Baal as part of their faith and there are other examples too numerous to mention. In some s ense the creation story and other tales in the Old Testament echo this re - writing of history, while they certainly contain i m- ages and icons of the original Aryan faith, they also reflect the distorted tradition established by the Pharisaic Priesthood. One of the best examples of this is the image of the Serpent. The Se r- pent was a sacred symbol of the Israelite tradition, throughout the Old Testament it is also used as a symbol of wisdom. Moses uses a serpent to heal the people of Israel, in Gematria the se r- pent has the same numerical as the Christ and is seen as a “type” of Jesus. Yet, at the same time, the Serpent is cursed in the priestly rendition of Genesis and seen as a symbol of evil. And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live Numbers 21:8 The se rpent clearly is the symbol of Gnosis, wisdom and the earliest traditions. Again, while we can see remnants of the Gnostic faith in the myths and legends of Genesis, we can also see clearly the later addition of elements that the fundamentalist Priesthood could use to fight against the Israelite tradition. While we do not aim to try and summarise the Qadesh tradition here, it was an inner esoteric tradition that embodied a special form of technology aimed at transforming man into god (deification). It represented the highest class within the spiritual h i- e r archy and included forms of Shamanism, ritual technology and Gnostic Science. It was the esoteric heart of the Israelite people, regardless of the nature of the outer forms. It was similar to the inner grades of the Essenes and Gnostic sects and is at the heart of the Gnostic Faith. "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 73 The Sacred Serpent The Serpent is an image central to the Gnosis, while this may at first seem unusual when we come to apprecia te the esotericism of the Serpent we can understand its significance. The major problem which arises with the iconography of the serpent or snake is the prejudice found in most Christian literature, this all too clearly, however, comes from a misunderstand ing of the image and distortion found in the Old Testament text. The Bible as a whole has an ambivalent view of the serpent or snake, on one hand it seems to be represented as evil, even as an icon of the devil himself, while on the other it is used to re p- r e sent wisdom and even perhaps salvation. The most obscure image is that found in Numbers 21:8 - 9 and Isaiah 15:29 where the serpen t is used as an image of redemption. Moses holds up the serpent (on a cross) to heal Israel - most Christian scholars agree th at this is a type of the coming Messiah, in Christian terms, Jesus himself. Accordingly, we have the unusual sugge s- tion of the Serpent as Jesus. In Hebrew numerology the numerical value of the serpent or snake is that of the Messiah. Many Gnos tic sects saw the serpent as the agent of redemption and the primary symbol of Gnosis. The Ophites (from the Greek word for serp ent, Ophis), like many modern Gnostic groups, ourselves included, believe that the serpent of the Genesis story was a representative for the Lord of Light (as was Jesus), while the Creator depicted in the Old Test a- ment was seen as the Demiurge. It has been suggested that since there was no town known as Nazareth existing in the first centur y common era, that the epithet Nazarene may actually be Naasarene which means the Serpentine and refers to Jesus’ ancestry within the Gnostic co m- munion. The iconography of the Serpent links the Gnostics with the earliest occult traditions. In ancient Egypt the Serpent was the symbol of duality, it was both creative and destructive. Since it had both a forked tongue and dual penis, it was used to r epresent the potential's for good and evil within sexuality and the intellect. As the serpent of earth it represented that which destroys, the constant returning to the earthly cycles. In this representation it was reproductive, earth bound and destructive . While for the Egyptians the heavenly Serpent was that which gave man the knowledge to perceive the divine. The Egyptians were well aware that serpents don’t fly, but by giving the serpent wings they emphasised the unique difficulty of going beyond the earthly c y- cles. The shedding of skin was a useful image for the cycle of eternal re - occurrence, whereby all things repeat until final ann ihilation or liberation is achieved. The serpent then could be understood as representing the knowledge of Good and Evil, in it s d e structive mode it represents out attachments to the material world.. In its heavenly mode it represents the secret knowledge of the light. To achieve this secret knowledge one must tran s- mute the instincts (the dual penis) and the intellect (the forked tongue) as well as going beyond the cycles of ordinary life (t he shedding of the skin). "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 74 Within the traditions of Gnosticism the Serpent is used to represent the path of the Pneumatic, the highest Path to the Treasury of Light. In our tradition, as in the Valentinian Gnostic school, there were three grades - the Hylic, Psychic and Pneumatic. T he Hylic was that of everyday man, it was sometimes represented by a crawling serpent, the snake of earth. The Hylic is the bulk of humanity, it has little innate spark of life and generally is a creature of instinct. The Psychic was the first path of Salv ation and was represented by the Dove. The Psychic is a mixture of light, mind and flesh and is dominated by his lower instincts , he needs the guidance of the Gnostic school to achieve liberation. The secret path was that of the Serpent of Light, the winged Se r- pent. This path is followed by the Pneumatics, the Parfait or children of the Pleroma. The duality represented by the snake is v ery expressive, in some ways it hints at the secret techniques used within the higher path. The very things than condemn the Hy lic to earth are turned and used to liberate the Pneumatic. The Serpent (and related images such as the snake and dragon) is ther e- fore a expressive image of the nature of the Gnosis. The winged serpent represents the highest wisdom, while the crawling serpen t represents the decay of earth. The duality of the snake is the dualism of the Ancient Wisdom. Israel on the World Stage If we continue from our Egyptian Israelite model, the next question is what happened to the Isr a- elite community ? The historical evidence suggested that the Priest class created a literalist/ fundamentalist “cult” which came to the forefront in Judaism after the time of Jesus. But where did the earlier Israelites go ? We know that ancient Israel, whos e capital was Samaria, was taken captive by the Assyrians in 721 BC and yet after this traditional history tells us that the ten tribes are lost - but is this really so ? Or has history also been twisted by scribes and politicians ? We know that Josephus w riting in 70 CE states \"the ten tribes did not return to Palestine only two tribes service the Romans after Palestine became a Roman province\". According to Second E s- dras (a book within the New Testament Apocrypha) the ten tribes moved a thousand miles west to Southeast Russia to become the people history knows as the Scythians. In Race and Civilis a- tion Roger Pearsons writes \" Nordic Scythians overran Palestine in the seventh century BC and the history of the Sacae or Scythians with their many tribes and branches is well worth follo w- ing. They originated in south - east Europe and moved through Asia as far as Turkestan and A f- ghanistan, even into India to the Indus. Many early writers (such as Polemon of Ilium, Galienos, Clement of Alexandria, Adamantos) state that the Scythians were similar to the Celts and Ge r- mans being fair or ruddy in hue\". Ancient historians including Ptolemy and Herodotus and modern historians such as Gibbon have also affirmed that the captive tribes of Israel were known through various periods as Guta, Gatae, Gauls, Goths, Manda, Dacians, Teutons, Normans, Angli, Suka, Scythians and Saxons. All these people were of the same racial stock and heritage as Ancient Israel. Now it is possible that Israel disa p- peared in one section of the world and the progenitors of the Anglo - Saxon - Celtic"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 75 people appeared in the same place a few years later without the two peoples b e- ing in anyway related but hardly probable! The overwhelming circumstantial ev i dence makes it appear that the lost tribes of Israel and the progenitors of the Anglo - Saxon - Celtic people were one and the same. And when, in addition to the circumstantial evidence cognizance is taken that these people have fulfilled what the prophets wro te of Israel, the probability becomes a certainty. Sharon Turner To really understand the nature of the early Israelite tradition they need to be seen as indig e- nous Mystery cults passed down from father to son (this is the meaning of the world Kabbalah) and embodying the secrets of creat ion. When Israel was taken into captivity a large segment of these teachings went with her and were transmitted to different loc ations around the globe and remnants remain in forms alien to what many would consider to be Judaic or Christian at all ! One of the major focus points of this tradition was within Ireland and England. The Druid Connection A classic example is found in the Druidic traditions. It is believed by many that the Druids b e- came the Priestclass of Israel in exile after they had settled in Ireland and England. Many facets of the early Druidic faith re semble what we know of the original Israelite Mysteries. The secret alphabet which the Israelites used was sustained by the Drui ds and for mnemonic purposes was related to trees (and later to Birds and Animals). The Druids also met in outdoor sanctuaries (certainly the original Israelite way of worship), kept to their own and sustained a priesthood which had much in common with the Qadesh. Certainly the native religion of the Celts and many other Indo - Europeans betray a strong similarity to the Israelite traditions. One interesting fact to note is that according to many modern linguists the Welsh language has more words taken fro m Hebrew than any other language world - wide. This and many other historical facts suggest that the traditions of early England rather than being darkly pagan were actually Gno s- tic and probably embodied more truth than what was being taught in the Churches that were a t- tacking them for heresy ! A later tradition regarding the relationship of Jesus to the Druids adds even further light on these c onnections.. In regards to Jesus traveling to Britain the details are sketchy but reliable. The evidence su g- gests that Israel was more of a cosmopolitan region than many scholars have realised, it had links with many peoples and many cu ltures. Joseph of Arimathea was a very rich man and it is now believed he bought and traded tin and other items from bases in England, probably Cor n- wall and Somerset. We know that after the death of Jesus around AD 63 St.Phillip actually sent Joseph and others back to England to preach the Gospel ( Refer . Victory of Aurelius Ambrosius by Gildad Albanicus). In regards to Jesus traveling to Britain with Joseph there are many trad i- tions in Somerset and other localities that certainly suggest same. It is even suggested that the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 76 very location of Glastonbury Cathedral is where Jesus and Joseph built their hut on their first trip to Britain. In the west ern confines of Britain there is a certain royal island of large extent, su r rounded by water, abounding in all the beauties of nature and necessaries of life. In it the first Neophites of Catholic Law, Go d beforehand acquainting them found a Church constructed by no human art but divinely constructed (by the hands of Christ himsel f) for the salvation of his people. The Almighty has made it manifest by many miracles and mysterious visitations that He contin ues to watch over it as sacred to Himself.... A letter from St.Augustine to Pope Gregory Amazing as it may seem even the Druid s believe that Jesus came to Britain and taught them the esoteric teachings, for example, Taliesin, the Bard and Druid (circa AD 550) states “Christ, the word from the beginning, was from the beginning our teacher and we never lost his teachings ”. There are many volumes examining the details of Jesus' trek to Britain, some of the more impo r- tant examine the historical record of Glastonbury which can be traced right back to the chapel built by Jesus himself. For this reason the site has continued to remain sacred and became the centre of other important legends and religious tales such as King Arthur and his knights. Obv i- ously since Britain was the destination for so many of the Lost tribes of Israel we may expect that it would be of primary importance for the early spreading of the message. From many a c- counts Ireland and England were the first countries outside Palestine to receive the Christian me s sage. The Essene Link Connected to these migrations is another very important link. When some of the people of Judah returned to Palestine after the captivity, not all accepted the Roman rule and integrated into the secular state. Though the Pharisees and Sadducees continued the fundamentalism form of Jud a- ism, some of those who returned kept the original Israelite faith and separated themselves off into the deserts. Though this group traveled from location to location, around approx. 180 BC they formed a s e- cret communal order to sustain the ancient Mysteries in the deserts of Palestine. This group kept separate from the rest of the local peoples but kept contacts with Greek and perhaps even Egy p- tian Mystery Cults. They were not insular but taught a form of the Mysteries with both Israelite, Greek and Egyptian elements. T his group was known as the Essenes and forms an important link in the survival of the Gnosis through the dark time from Constant ine's rule to the present."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 77 If it is true as everyone attests, that Moses left an oral law, it is amongst the Ess e- nes that it was preserved. The Pharisees who flattered themselves so highly on po s sessing it, only has its outward forms, as Jesus reproaches them at every m o- ment. It is from these latter that the modern Jews descend. La Langue Hebraique, Fabre D'Olivet. While we will study the Essene s in more detail later, they form an important background, as it is from them that Jesus came and re - established the Gnostic fai th. They are not an easy group to u n derstand as they were in some sense transitionary. While they tried to keep the original Israe l- ite faith they were also corrupted by many local customs, laws and beliefs and hence while their hearts were in the right place, their beliefs were not. Their value is more in the bridge they cr e- ated for the Gnostic traditions and Jesus, than in their own doctrinal stance. Jesus was not a Jew racially or by geography (h e was a Galilean), he was certainly not a Jew by religion either but an Israelite in the Essene sense. In this context we can then see how Gnost i- cism (or real Christianity) developed out of the Israelite - Essenes, not the fundamentalist or literal Judaism of the Pharisees.. They (The Essenes) were not waiting to receive the Law - they already possessed it. Their aim was to deliver it from the realms of darkness in which it had been e n- gulfed. The Torah, that is, the Divine Teachings as revealed to Moses had, it was held, been successively perverted by false exp ositors . The Dead Sea Scriptures, Theodore Gaster, Doubleday, NY. The Essenes, Jesus and the Foundations of Gnosticism The work of Jesus is central to the transformation of the Gnostic Tradition. Jesus as a pre - existent spirit; the Arch - Angel Michael took human form so he could show the way back to the Pleroma. He was born and lived as a human with the same potential for faili ng; same potential for suffering as all humans, he experienced the tides of the material world and overcome them. He traveled the world in his \"so - called\" missing years, studying in both India and Britain, brin g- ing the threads of the Mystery Tradition to a common climax. While at the same time achieving a mastery of himself and the world around him. The baptism of Jesus shows clearly his high state of Initiation, his energy field has been cleansed of its fallen elements by Sophia and in recogn i- tion of his achievement, the Divine Will acknowledges his new state. Michael is now Jesus the Christ, the Christ state being the achievement of communication with the Mind of God or the L o- gos. "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 78 As soon as Jesus was baptised, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God desce nding like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\" Matthew 3:16,17 Jesus was now in a position to transform the human situation, as a Son of God (a being whose essence is in com mune with the Logos and whose actions embody the Holy Spirit), he now went about his task of redeeming Israel. He was the Messi ah from the Land of Light come for his people. These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: \"Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans, go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, preach this message: `Th e kingdom of heaven is near.' He answered, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\" Matthew 10:5 - 7 Matthew 15:24 Jesus however had more to achieve than simply transmit the Gnosis to Israel, Jesus had to in i- t i ate the current which would open the door to the Mysteries. By being initiated into the Ess e- nes he brought Greek Mystery traditions and Israelite wisdom together, by being trained by the Israelites he has a link back to Egypt (also through the Greek). His travels in England and I n- dia brought into “pagan” and Hindu/Buddhist wisdom, so the Christ literally brought together many streams of esotericism into on e font of secret wisdom. This teaching was certainly for I s rael but in a new sense, it was for those prepared for initiation not for any discrete historical, cultural or racial class alon e. This Gnosis or secret knowledge, clearly inferred that doctrine or belief was not enough, Jesus himself had to spiritually tr ansform the nature of the material plane, so a new current, a new vibration was available which offers redemption from our false perceptions and our self created imprisonment."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 79 The Aim of Life The aim of life is to offer man a chance to gain salvation, to enter the path of Transfiguration. Since time im memorial the pleroma has outlined an escape route, a path by which man may awaken the True Self and grasp the gift of immortality. And immortality is a gift, in all m y- thol o gies we find a quest for immortality, a trial that leads to a reward of life eternal. In the twelve labours of Hercules we have a series of initiations which lead to eternal life, while in the quest for the Golden Fleece (of immortality) we have Jason over coming immense odds to grasp it. The Divine will offers man many chances to gain immortality and these chances take place in many lives. Reincarnation within Gnostic thought is not the same as it is within eastern ph i- losophy. Reincarnation occurs within a limited period and offers the opportunity for immorta l- ity, it is not an immortal soul gaining experience but a mortal “self” being offered opportunity on opportunity to enter the spi ritual path. Reincarnation is also limited in time, while we do not know the number of lives or opportunities man is given, ther e is a limited time allotment after which the cycle is completed and unredeemed lifesparks cease to individually exist, unless t hey have been re - awakened by Transfiguration. The Bible and Reincarnation Now you may react by arguing that there is no Biblic al authority for reincarnation. However, I am afraid that you would be very, very wrong. In the early Christian Church there wer e many that taught reincarnation. Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Jerome, Gregoras, Augustine and Irenaeus - to name but a few. It was only during the Council of Nicea in 325 AD that the co n- cept of reincarnation became unpopular and this was coupled with the development of teac h- ings regarding the Trinity, Eternal Hellfire, purgatory and other dogma's which were imported into the Church for political reasons by Emperor Constantine. It was only in AD 553 at the Se c- ond Council of Constantinople that reincarnation was finally and formally condemned. In regards to Scripture itself it is obvious that Church copyists have removed many of the cla s- sic reincarnation references, however, references still do occur if you look closely and carefully analyse what you read. In th e Book of Revelation we have an exciting description of what will occur at the end of the earth cycle when the \"born again\", the spiritually transformed enter the New Kingdom. As part of the description the following is outlined.... Chapter Eight: Chapter Eight: Conditional Immortality & Conditional Immortality & Reincarnation Reincarnation"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 80 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the nam e of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. Revelation 3:12 This verse clearly explains that those who have overcome (that is those who com pleted their spiritual development), will become a pillar in the temple of God and he shall go out no more, that is, he will rei ncarnate no longer. This is obviously the message intended in this verse. Also when we examine the Gospels we find Jesus asking the disciples, who do they think I am ? You would think that when the disciples answer in terms of reincarnation that if this w as incorrect Jesus would certainly correct them ! Surely he would not let them continue in their i g- norance ! But no, Jesus accepts what they say but simply corrects them in regards to his own identity ! When Jesus came into th e coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, sa y ing, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others , Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the li v- ing God. Matthew 16:13 We can then continue and note that in Matthew 17:10 - 13 Jesus informs them that he could not be Elias as Elias has already returned as John the Baptist ! (But I say unto you that Elias is come already and they knew him not). This is very obviously a description of reincarnation. A n other excellent example is the commentary on Luke 12:58 - 59 offered by Carpocrates, a Gnostic leader from the Third Century. As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled to him on the way, or he may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. I tell you, you will not get out unt il you have paid the last penny. Luke 12:58,9. Carpocrates explains that the true meaning of this tale is that the opponent is the Demiurge, our perception of matter and that the jail is the body (the fallen material world) itself. No one can e s cape reincarnation until all earthly actions have been experienced.

Micah 5:2 I think from these references it becomes qui te clear that reincarnation was taught by the early Gnostic Christian church and even though the Bible has gone through constant editing and r e- writing reincarnation still survives into the modern translations. The Mechanism of Reincarnation To understand the way in which reincarnation works we have to examine the effects of our a c- tions. Now, in generally held Christian views there is a belief that actions do not have an effect, we ask for forgiveness and a ll is gone. This is obviously not correct, every action has an effect. Even if the moral (and the If is big !) punishment was removed from an act by asking for fo r- giveness the natural effect of that act remains ! (For example, I get Hepatitis from a heroin i n- jection, while I may be forgiven for damaging my temporal physical vehicle, I still have to deal with the disease !) This proces s of cause and effect is found in many different traditions, in some forms of eastern philosophy it is known as Sanskaras or Kar ma. If a soul when it has entered the body persists in evil it does not taste the fruits of life eternal, but is dragged back again, it reverses it courses and takes its way back to creeping things and that ill - fated soul having failed to know itself, li ves in servitude to uncouth and noxious bodies, in this doom are vicious souls co n- demned. Hermes . "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 82 In the western tradition it is figuratively called The Book of Judgement. This book is a balance sheet of the actions of the person as he reincarnates. As time progresses the positive and neg a- tive attributes of a person’s life weigh against each other and the person continues to reinca r- nate. At various stages the balance will reach a crucial stage and accordingly the circumstances of a persons life will drastically change to give them a further opportunity to enter Transfigur a- tion. These opportunities continue until the Omega Day when the cycle draws to a close. If the person has entered the spiritual life, then during these stages a slow and steady transformation of the Mind into True Self will occur (this process is called T ransfiguration) and the born again persons name is figuratively transferred to the Book of life. No longer is a record kept of a ction and reaction, but a record of growth and spiritual transformation. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in whit e raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before hi s angels.

The Coming Revolution, J.Van Rijckenborgh. The mechanism and aim of reincarnation is clear. Reincarnation is a process by which the D i- vine Will uses the experiences of our lives to awaken us to his spiritual truth. The opportunities for liberation are limited an d the clock of cause and effect (The Book of Judgement) is ticking away. If we ignore the opportunities enough, then at the Omeg a day we may end up simply cea s ing to exist. If we accept the opportunity, then our names are transferred to the Book of Life and our transformation begins. H eaven and Hell Having studied this far you still may have many questions regarding the Gnostic view of rei n- ca r nation, and you may wonder about the Judaic and Christian views regarding Heaven and Hell. Accordingly, we shall examine them f or a moment. Heaven and Hell are symbols, within the Bible there is clearly more than meets the eye when we consider the various Hebrew and Greek terms used for them. The problem that arises when critically considering Heaven and Hell in the Biblical text is the problem of textual distortion. One of the easiest ways to come to an honest understanding is to let the original terms s peak for themselves. For example, there are many different terms for Hell. Like the many differing names of God, the various modern copyists have tended to use one word in numerous locations, where in rea l-"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 83 ity there are multiple words in the original Hebrew or Greek, which each offer many possible i n terpretations. Hell on Earth The term Sheol is used a lot in the Bible and as used in the Old testament can be interchanged with Grave, Pit, and Abode of the Dead. It is used to describe the state of the dead in relation to earth. The dead have no con sciousness in relation to earth as they have returned to it ! The Grave or the state of being dead (without consciousness) is used to represent the lack of awar e- ness the reincarnating soul has of the earth sphere. Time and time again this term is used to r e- fer to cessation of activity and not in reference to an eternal fire or to any \" spiritual realm \". Hell - First it stands for the Hebrew Sheol of the Old Testament and the Greek Hades of the Septuagint and the New Testament. Sheol in Old Testament times referred simply to the abode of the dead and suggested no moral distinctions, the word Hell as understood today, is not a happy translation. Colliers Encyclopaedia, 1986 Vol. 12 PG 28. The Term Hades is the New Testament equivalent of the Hebrew Sheol a nd therefore has the same meaning - the Grave or in esoteric terms, the astral plane where a soul resides between i n- carnations and returns to earth again and again and again. The general tone of these Biblical terms are negative, that is, that the process of returning to the grave and returning back to earth is painful and destructive, from a Gnostic perspective this is certainly true. The other term reg u- larly used for hell explains this even better, Gehenna (used in the New Testament) has a very specific meaning and symbolism. I t literally refers to the valley of Hinnom and hence can only be understood in the context of what this valley represented. The Valley of Hinnom was located outside the walls of Jerusalem and was a large rubbish dump. Fires were triggered by the ad d- ing of sulphur so that the rubbish could be burnt up. It became the common lay stall of the city, where the dead bodies of crim inals and the carcasses of animals and every other kind of filth was cast.. Smith's Bible Dictionary. It is such an apt descrip tion of the how we experience the darker aspects of our world, into which we are forced to reincarnate - criminals, carcasses of animals and every kind of filth. When we die, the body is eaten by animals or burnt by sulphur, or in more modern terms, cr e- mated or buried and our soul then again must return. This sort of eternal re - occurance, “hell on earth” is the iconography of Ha des, Sheol and Gehenna, it is the real meaning of Hell.

Hell, then, is not some eternal location to which we are damned in the future, indeed, in the Gnostic trad i- tion, the end of those not awakened is simply oblivion, nothingness, ceasing to exist.

The Hebrew Shamayim (always used in the plural) is tr anslated ‘heavens’, but basically means high or lofty. It is used to refer to the atmosphere of earth (such as in Deut 4:17, P roverbs 30:19), outer space (Heb 11:12, Isa 13:10), the sky (Isa 45:8) and a range of other localities. The term is also used to refer to the higher worlds. In some ways it can be used to both refer to the astral worlds (the lower heavens) and the true hea vens (the Pleroma) above. "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"What is the Aim of this Spiritual Process ? To understand this is to focus on a central issue in the teachings of the Gnosis, that of the My s- teries . To appreciate the esoteric or Mystery teachings that are at the centre of Gnosticism we need to understand that the Gnos is is a progressive revelation. The Divine Will reveals to man knowledge (Gnosis) only as man is capable and willing to receive it. Certainly the knowledge that the Lord revealed to Moses was more advanced than that he revealed to Abraham and ce r- tainly the teachings of Jesus to his twelve disciples was different from that which he gave to the multitudes. In recent studies it has been discovered that Jesus laid the groundwork for the i m- parting of the Mysteries in the secret teachings he gave to his disciples, but even at his death did not believe they were ready for the inner mysteries. It now seems likely that these teachings, known as The Mysteries, were imparted to James, the Brother of Jesus and then to the other di s- ciples. Over and over again St.Paul intimates that there is a special knowledge: The Mystery (Ephesians 3.3), The Mystery of Chr ist (Ephesians 3:4), The Mystery of his Will (;9), The Great Mystery (5:32), The Mystery of Christ (Colossians 2;2), The fellows hip of the Mystery (Ephesians 3;9) and so on. Paul tells us in Ephesians 3:9 that the Mystery had been hid in God and that it h ad been a secret from the beginning of the world. The Mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now made manifest to his saints. Ephesians 1:26 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching o f Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, But now is made manifest, and by the Scri p- tures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith . Romans 16:25,6 This Mystery is the opportunity for the deification of man. It is the secret whereby man may b e- come part deified. He may return to the Pleroma awakened and in a state of divininity. It is clear that this path is not for all of Adam's children, but for a select number, the Psyhics and Pneumatics.

"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 87 The Nature of Theosis (Deification) Central to the Gnostic understanding of humanity is the belief that it is possible for man to b e- come part of the God - Family. While mankind as a whole may seem to be in a pretty dismal state at present, the Gnostics have alw ays taught that it is possible for the “particles of light” to be redeemed, and for those who seek, to find the Treasury of Ligh t. This doctrine of Theosis or deification has been a major part of the Mystery tradition since the earliest days and has su r- vived, albeit, in modified form, to the present in both the exoteric and esoteric traditions. The concept of deification is fou nd in the earliest religious systems, the rites of Kingship in both Sumeria and Egypt centred on the king being initiated throug h a secret rite of death and rebirth so that he could become a mediator between his people and God. As the mediator he was consi dered divine and was imputed with the symbols of divinity. In these early periods the way in which humanity contacted the higher worlds was through the Priest/King, in these th e- ocracies individuals could not be deified in their own right, but achieved the power to develop and grow through the mediatorshi p of the divine Priest/King. While certainly the morality of these kings varied and so did the focus of their mediatorship, the principle remained, neverth e- less, the same and the tradition continued. As the ages rolled on, mankind’s interaction with the spiritual worlds changed, rath er than theocracies non - theistic political systems developed and the role of mediator was replaced by the priest, shaman or wise person. Through death and rebirth rites the priest achieved a state of power whereby s/he was able to mediate between the spiri tual and physical worlds. At this stage we can see that individual Theosis was still far in the future, mediatorship was embodie d in the Prophet, Priest, Shaman or wise person. The rites of Kingship and priesthood were kept secret and at first only passed via brotherhoods, cults and orders, however later they were also transmitted to individual priests and shamans who qualified but were outside the “monastic” system. Theosis at these early stages involved collective as well as individual gnosis, the land and the king, for example, in the Celtic trad i- tion were intricately connected. In ancient Israel the people could only be cleansed by the Priest entering the Holy of Holies o nce a year and undertaking secret rites on behalf of his pe o ple. A natural development after the mediating priest was the achievement of the individual right to deification. However, th is involved spiritual as well as psychological changes. Man could not just develop the right to be deified, the Divine Will had to reach into the lower worlds and change the nature of the mystical path. Through the work of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, a r e- l i gious transformation occurred and mankind was given the right to enter the Kingdom of Light. In the past some individuals had be en able to achieve Theosis (Enoch walked with God and was not), but these were unique cases and were above and beyond the norm. In prepar a- tion for the work of Jesus and James, the Qumran community (the Essenes) had been formed, the teacher of righteousness began to outline the requirements for individual Theosis and this became the Mystery teachings of the Essenes. Other mystery cults undertook similar prepar a- tion."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 88 The Essenes rejecting the apostate forms of literalist Judaism, separated themselves into the d e- serts and began preparation for the great change which was to occur. They understood that there were to be two Messiahs, a King (Davidic) and a Priestly. Today these two Messiahs have been misunderstood and the concept of Messiah or Christ has been distort ed. In ancient Israel the Christ or Messiah was not one individual, it was a state of consciousness, a role and a task. The Davi dic Messiah was the King who was expected to liberate Israel from its prison, while the Priestly Messiah was to give Israel a ne w spiritual impetus. These two roles need to be carefully considered. In present scholarship there is a tendency to confuse lit eralist and fundamentalist forms of Judaism with the Gnostic forms of the Israelite Mysteries. Accordingly, the King Messiah ten ds to be seen in purely political and revolutionary terms, while certainly there is a political element to the message of the Da vidic Messiah we must realise that since matter is only a temporal manifestation, for the Messiah to save Israel as a whole (as a collective of particles of light), the physical world must be redeemed ! This is why there is such an apocalyptic emphasis in Essene and Gnostic literature, for the Davidic Me s siah to complete his task all matter must be trasnformed back to spirit. Accordingly, the role of the Davidic Messiah was to pre pare Israel for a new interpretation of the Kingdom of God, Jesus as the Davidic Messiah illustrated how individual Theosis was possible. For through individual Theosis the particles of light may be liberated and at the Omega Day all light r e- trieved from matter. By his deat and resurrection (whether literal or as a Mystery enactment) he embodied the old rites of Kings hip and taught how individuals through death and rebirth could become deified. During the life of Jesus, he prepared his discip les for this change in spiritual technology. He taught how they could come into contact with their Light selves but that only af ter his death could they receive the power of Sophia. It was only after he had conquered death that a path to individual Theosis became available and the task of those who followed such as Mary Ma g- daelne and Simon Magus. Later the Gnostic St.Paul offered a full revelation of the Mystery of Theosis. The new teachings as revealed by Jesus and Paul has two distinct aspects, the first is that of i n- d i vidual self discovery. This is the path of the Dove known to the Gnostics as the Psychic Path. It is the path outlined by Jesus. After the death of Jesus and outpouring of Sophia at Pentecost, James the Just revealed a second path, the path of the Serpent or the Pneumatic Path. This is the path of Theosis or deification. The concept of Theosis is found in the writings of many Churc h Fathers and is embodied in the initiations described in the Secret Gospel of Mark (refer works of Morton Smith). The path of t he Serpent involved secret training, occult techniques and death and rebirth rites, it was both a way of life and a ritualised p rocess. (As it is today). There were two paths of survival for the doctrine of Theosis. As the Gnostic cults came and"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 89 went the doctrine was passed from one to another and flowered in the Cathars and Knight Te m- plars. From the Knight Templars the doctrine passed to various esoteric orders and was tran s- mi t ted via Freemasonry and occult traditions. This form of the doctrine of deification sustained the technology and science, but lo st most of the ethical and religious teachings associated with it. On the other hand, the doctrine was also passed from the Gnostic cults to various Monastic o r- ders within the Orthodox Church. Here the doctrine took root and became an accepted teaching within the Orthodox traditions. It is still taught today within most Orthodox communions, ho w- ever, over the centuries it has lost it context, esotericism and technology and in such an exoteric form exists as little more t han a name. We also know that the esoteric form of Theosis was taught to Gurdjieff by various esoteric Christian bodies and made its way into modern Fourth Way Schools. A prime example is in the work of Boris Mouravieff (Praxis Institute) who co m- bines Orthodoxy with Fourth Way traditions. Theosis or deification is central to the Gnostic tradition. It represents the natu ral development of the inner transfigurative processes of Ancient Israel. We can see how the Divine Will r e- vealed knowledge to man first through Kingship in a theocracy, then through the Prophets and Shamans and finally directly to the human soul through initiation and Transfiguration. The e s- sence of the Transfiguration process is the ability of an individual to enter the path of rebirth and escape the Archons to retu rn home as a immortal member of the God - family. The Mystery The Mystery is central to our understanding of the real message of the Apostolic Gnosis. That is also why we tend to call True Christianity, Gnostic Christianity, as the term Gnosis means Knowledge. However, Gnosis represents more than theory, it represents the living experience of the knowledge or Mystery. The M ystery is more than ancient theory, it comprises a series of doctrines and practises that actually offer transformation of man i nto God. Jesus, our Elder Brother outlined a technology, a spiritual process whereby man may be sanctified and purified to such a level that he is transformed into child of the Treasury of Light. This process is that of Transfiguration and encompasses the idea of being Born again and is very different from what you may have been taught about being reborn.          To be Born Ag ain The actual nature of the process of Transfiguration is important to define, so is the way of ente r- ing into it. The fundamentalist Christian concept of simply giving your life to Jesus is utterly alien to the real teachings of the Master Jesus. The process of being born again is just that, a process . Just like a child takes nine months from conception to birth, so the process of being r e- born takes a long period of time, perhaps even many lives. It is an apt description, birth brings us into the fallen words, rebi rth takes us out of it ! The moment of conception is that time when"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 90 you decide to enter onto the Path of Transfiguration. From that conception you begin to grow and transform from a person of the flesh to a being of spirit, from a slave of the Archons to a centre of Light. The choice of reproductive imagery is deliberate, since the Gnostic tradition is anti - reproductive, in some sense to be born again is to be de - born as well as reborn, you have chosen to create a new self within yourself rather than perpetuate the cycle by reproducing an external self (a child). For mos t of us, this transformation is not completed within our life - span (s), and hence we have to wait until the end of the cosmic cyc le when the children of the Pleroma are finally reborn into the new Kingdom. The Nature of Transfiguration Transfiguration of fers the transformation of man. It offers liberation from the cycles of the World of the Archons and transfiguration into a new Being, a child of the Treasury of Light. Transfiguration is based on the example of Jesus who through his Ascension to become th e first Born of the Treasury of light opened the way so we can enter the spiritual Path. This Path is known as the Path(es) of t he Dove and Serpent or the Path of Transfiguration. When a person enters the Path, the Pneumatic Spark or Light Self that has been frozen in time awakens and b e- gins to grow once again. Sophia cleanses the Mind, instincts and other constituents of the ps y- chic apparatus and prepares the initiate for communion with the Logos or Mind of God. The process of rebirth is just that, a process. Nobody is immediately born again, the process of r e- birth takes much time (even lifetimes) from conception (entering the spiritual Path) to final r e- birth into the Kingdom of God. Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which livet h and abideth for ever. 1 Peter 1:23 Transfiguration involves both Grace and Works, Justification and Sanctification. These ar e loaded terms but important in understanding how the process of rebirth actually operates. The moment you enter the Spiritual p ath you are seen as reborn, that is, the Pleroma perceives you as a new creature, a new being. The Aeons see you as a child of t he Light. In this sense you are justified, that is, through Transfiguration you are seen as reborn. However, you must now live up to this commission and actually achieve this state. Many start the path but do not make it. There is a vast difference between the initial act of justification and the long process of purific a- tion or sanctification through which you must travel before you are actually reborn. By Grace you have entered the spiritual path, by works you make it to the moment of Rebirth. The pro c- ess of transformation is a difficult and demanding trek however by following the teachings of the Gnosis you will reach the goal . Just like there are many miscarriages in this world, there are many in the spiritual world. Being conceived on the Path of Tra nsfiguration is not enough, the Path itself must be traveled! "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 91 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. 1 Corin thians 5:17 The Two Paths The first Path is known as the Terrestrial Path or that of the Dove. There are actually two paths within the process of Transfiguration. Before anyone can enter the Path of the Serpent of Wi s- dom or the Celestial Path they must have passed through the Terrestrial first. The Terrestrial Path is the path of rebirth for most Gnostics, it is a demanding way which transforms the Di a- le c tic into the very substance of the Treasury of Light. In the New Testament it is the Path of the Called. In the secret teachings of Valentinus those who enter the Path of the Dove are known as Psychics, while those who follow the secret Path of the Serpent are known as Pne u- matics. The Path of the Dove has seven stages. These seven stages illustrate the process of the Terre s- trial path, after the Gnostic has worked through these stages he can rightly be called a Child of the Treasury of Light. At this point, depending on his destiny, he will reincarnate and teach and assist others or he will enter the Celestial or Secret Path. The destiny of those who remain as Children of the Dove is to be reborn as Immortal beings living on the restored Light world which will be the replacement for Earth. The Earth will be rectified and return to the Static Kingdom and will exist in a dimen sion of Light populated by those of the Terrestrial Path of R e birth. The Mysteries .....and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidde n in God, who created all things. Ephesians 3:9 The Word of God is now God as He had been man, in order to deify mankind t o- gether with himself. Eusebius, Demonstratio Evangelica IV:14 The Mysteries are a special teaching which is not covered in most Biblical studies. It is the final secret teaching revealed by Christ (after his ascension) to St.Paul and then onto the other Apo s- tles. The teaching was the last stage of the continuing development of the spiritual System given by Jesus. The Mysteries are de scribed in a range of New Testament books as the Mystery (Ephesians 3:3), The Mystery of Christ (Ephesians 3:4), The Great Myste ry (Ephesians 5:32), The Administration of the Mystery (Ephesians 3;9) and in many other verses. This teaching was"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 92 an esoteric Gnosis which was not available until its revealing after the death of Jesus. This teaching was a special wisdom for a certain class of initiate. The Divine Will would call certain people from the Path of Terrestrial Salvation to enter a new wa y, that of Celestial Deification. And that is the nexus of this new specialized teaching, that some of the initiates would be called to become Part of the God Family, in other worlds, Gods themselves ! This special Path is known as the Celestial Path, t he Path of the Serpent of Wisdom or The Path of the Chosen Ones. Initiates on this Path were known in some traditions as Parfait or Perfected Ones. This S e cret teaching has been known to the Orthodox Churches for some time but has been taught in radically divergent fashion. Gods es sence is inaccessible. His uncreated and eternal energies (Glory, Light, Love) permeate the universe and make possible a personal union with man. In its worship the Church offers thanksgiving that God has opened the way for man to come to him and has made u nion with him possible. This is the Orthodox Churches' teaching of the deification (theosis) of man, a do c trine based on the Incarnation, which revealed a new perfect humanity.....This union is the goal of prayer and participation in the Sacraments, it involves the co - operation of two wills, divine and human. In this union with God human beings become \" partak ers of the divine nature \" (II Peter 1:4) without ceasing to be cre a tures. Other New Testament writers expressed this union in terms of being or dwelling in Christ. The fathers of the Church as well as modern theologians recognised that deific a- tion as the goal of Christian life lies at the base of every important theological controversy in the history of the Orthodox Ch urches. Abingdon Dictionary of Living Religions, Page 553. In simple terms the Divine Will will call certain Gnostics on the Pa th of Transfiguration onto a special road. These will be few in number and the demands on them will be ever so great. Their firs t task will be the mastery of the Terrestrial Path, however, then rather than reincarnating si m ply to teach and assist, they will achieve perfection while doing the special tasks required by The Lord of Wisdom. Some of the se Perfect Ones will achieve some measure of perfection in the flesh and become emissaries of the divine in their lifetimes. T he Mysteries are very different from the more traditional Gnostic paths for they include no moral or ethical restrictions, for a s a man becomes part of God, he will act as the voice of God directs. These Perfected Ones or Parfait as the Cathars called them , are few and far between. As it is all too easy for a man to claim immortality and perfection, it is another thing to actually achieve it. In many cases the Ecclesia themselves \" administered the Mysteries \", that is, they"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 93 recognized or denied the state of Perfection to avoid charlatans and false prophets claiming the title without right. I said, `You are \"gods\"; you are all sons of the Most High.' Psalms 82:6 Mystery of the Melchisedek Priesthood Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchizedek. Hebrews 5:10 One of the ways we can see the differences between the two paths of Salvation is found in an u n- derstanding of the Priesthood of Melchizedek. This priesthood is a special, immortal Royal line which was founded by the Lord of Wisdom in the period before creation. It is a unique Pries t- hood and one available to all those of Israel. It comprises, however, various levels or hierarchies within it. The four levels of the Melchizedek Priesthood are: 1 First Born of Creation. 2 144,000 Elders. 3 Celestial Class. 4 Terrestrial Class. The Fi rst born of Creation is Michael who became Jesus himself. He is the Highest Priest of all. The 144,000 Elders are of a special class. They are the Overmen or Succeeders from the last c y- cle. They are a group who passed right through the seven phases of the previous Adamic evol u- tionary cycle. When they saw the destruction being reeked throughout our universe by our own ignorance and stupidity, they elect ed not to continue on with their own development but to return and incarnate on earth to assist the lost souls of our planet. Th ey are virginal in the sense that while they are incarnated in human bodies they were not of this cycle, they are the true first fruits from beyond earth. Throughout history they have reincarnated as teachers, leaders, warriors and priests, they were the bu ilders of the Great Pyramid in Egypt under Enoch and will lead the Lost tribes of Israel in the End times.

These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. Revelation 13:3 - 4 The Celestial Class are those who have reached perfection through the Path of Transfigur a- tion and achieved a state of Godhood. They continue to incarnate on earth working with the Will (Logos) of the Lord of Wisdom. In the end time the 144,000 in conjunction with the C e- lestial Class will fulfil the role of the \"Left Hand of God\" cleansing the planet in preparation for his return. The Celestial c lass will be deified and unit with the pleroma. The Terrestrial Class are those who achieve perfection at the resurrection. They apply and fo l- low the Gnostic principles in many lives as they transform from earthly to heavenly substance. The terrestrial class will contin ue their development in the next “Great Chain of Being “ (new heaven and new earth).

Each of which we shall examine in some detail... 1 First Steps. 2 Faith and Education. 3 Baptism. (Initiation). 4 Anointing. (Holy Spirit). 5 Overcoming The Dialectic System. 6 (Communion and Feasts). 7 Rebirth 8 Resurrection. First Steps: Repentance The word repentance rings in the ears of most of us who had the misfortune of being brought up in Christian traditions. The problem is that most people have no knowledg e of what the word really means ! The image of repentance in keeping with the traditions of most of western Chri s- t i anity, is simply to say you’re sorry, you can do whatever you want as long as you say sorry to God and get forgiven. However, this is not what the Gnostic tradition or for that matter the B i- ble really says. The actual term repentance means to turn about, to reverse, to change. It means a point where an individual dec ides his life is going the wrong way and turns it about and heads in another direction. The term repentance in the Gnostic sense means to awaken to the fact that one's life; being, mind and emotions are chained to the Dialectic field and whatever ones does , one cannot escape. Hence, only through Transfiguration can liberation be achieved. The first stage of Transfiguration is to turn away, to repent, to give - up the Path of the world (The Diale c- tic field) and begin the trek to Redemption. This change of direction starts with the simple acknowledgment of the Covenant and by a co n- scious effort to start living the life of a true Gnostic. Chapter Ten: Chapter Ten: The Seven Stages of Salvation The Seven Stages of Salvation"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 96 First Steps:Detachment and Controlled Awareness When Buddha said all life was suffering he wasn't joking ! The perceptiveness of Gautama Bu d- dha's understanding of how the Dialectic system is perpetuated cannot be underestimated. As Buddha expressed in his four Noble t ruthes, all life is suffering because we become attached to what happens to us and attachment leads to reaction and reaction to attachment. Buddha's sol u- tion is interpreted by modern scholars of the Buddhist traditions (Himayana and Mahayana) to be total detachment. There, however, is a problem. If we understand that the Dialectic system is su s- tained by action and reaction then total detachment and total attachment both will have ramific a- tions and by logic, reactions. If we see 0 or no linkage to the Dialectic system as the goal then D e tachment would be negative ( - 1) and attachment would be positive (+1). Both involve actions and reactions. Many Gnostic schools apply western versions of Buddha's logic the problem ho w- ever is that when we attempt to totally detach from the world, the reaction is normally so strong, we end up in total attachment ! One of the first steps in the Path is that of \"Controlled Awar e- ness\". Controlled Awareness is becoming totally aware of what is happening within us and around us. It involves realising that the process of rebirth involves the \"death\" of the old terre s- trial mind and emotions, and the rebuilding of a new Self. Transfiguration awakens the real self, a Self we have never experienced and one which is truly ‘us’ and yet so alien at first. Accor d- ingly the new Gnostic on the Path must become aware of the changes that are occurring within him and observe and understand the reactions and actions that occur. The \"controlled\" facet of awareness is in the fact that the Gnostic must slowly learn to make decisions about what occurs in his mind and emotions. A pause must be created before an action is taken; an emotion is e x- pressed; a behaviour is enacted and a decision made regarding its value in light of the Spiritual Path. In some situations attachment will be the answer, in others detachment, the key is awar e- ness and the focus is on controlled decision making. Full detachment and full attachment are o p- posites and hence lead further into the Dialectic rather than away from it. First Steps:Study, Conviction and Emotion The structure of the psyche must also be taken into consideration. How many of us focus on c a- reers, money, music, fame and so on. The true Gnostic must be focused on the Spiritual Path and nothing else. In the Gospels the allegory of giving up all is used, obviously you are not expected to give away everything but your sole goal must be to reach t he Treasury of Light. Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. Luke 18:22 Developing this thought we need to consider the role of the Mind and the Emotions in our lives. For most of us, prior to entering the Path, our Lords a re either the Mind or the emotions. Yet on the spiritual path this cannot be so, the mind is a good scribe but a bad master, the emotions and"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 97 the body are excellent followers but rotten leaders. The new Self which is awakening must take control of the body (\"Put your H ouse in Order\") and a restored Mind and Emotions will take their rightful place beneath it. In the life of the Gnostic there should be a simple set of princ i- ples... 1 Study should come first, study the Scriptures, study the Gnostic texts and the Restored Gnostic keys. 2 Secular thinking and belief come second ! Logic and belief must be based in a firm fou n- dation, the foundation of Self and the Lord of Wisdom. 3 Thirdly and definitely only third comes the body and the emotions. Su re, look after the body and enjoy the world, but do so with care ! Just because you wake up one morning feeling bad does not mea n you have fallen off the spiritual path. But remember, the world is a trap, a dialectic prison and hence indulgence (+1) or att achment and mortification ( - 1) or detachment are both actions and reactions and hence part of the prison we are caught in. Fait h and Education One of the most important steps on the Path is that of education or more correctly, re - education. When the Gnos tic begins to really study the Bible with the Keys of the Mysteries a whole new understanding arises and this new understanding (Gnosis) will change forever the way he looks at the world. Study is hence a major part of the Path of Transfiguration and it le ads to a whole new way of examining the world. This viewpoint is sometimes called faith but is better d e- scribed as Conviction. It is a worldview that grows out of the experience of the Gnosis. An e x- p e riential wisdom that the world is really a fallen place, and that we are being called home to a n other world, another dimension; another order of being. The process of re - education is co n- stant as it involves a battle, everyday we are programmed with garbage from the Dialectic sy s- tem, Television, radio, newspapers, novels, books, friends, family members...all offer us the wi s dom of the world. Accordingly, everything we are fed enters into our minds and conflicts with the new developing Self. But thi s is just the beginning ! Within everyone of us are false selves, little identities created out of desires and unconscious materials (internal Archons), these false selves like Gods demand a t- tention and control. These little selves are nodes of unconscious desires and experiences and hence are \"restricted\" in focus and knowledge, they are therefore extremely dangerous and d e- structive. Little Gods of Self hate, Lust, Narcissism, addictions etc. all control and cloud the mind and instincts. They refuse to allow us to live in the present replaying past events and cr e- a t ing false associations between present events and the past. They control the mind to such an extent that the Voice of God (the Logos) cannot be heard and we become lost within our inte r- nal fallen worlds. At the same time, the old Mind and emotions are also false Gods, for their place is in submission to the awa kened Self (True Self) not in domination of it. The structure of"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 98 the True Man is like a chariot, the body is the Chariot itself, riding in it is the True Self, the mind is the reins and the Ho rses are the emotions. Only when these constituents are in their rightful place does the chariot speed in the right direction. T he horses are good at their given task but very bad drivers ! So all things must be in their place and this is the task of Trans figuration. The process of re - education involves a long and arduous battle in which the old \" Gods \" die and a new God is reborn . The Mind and Emotions are destroyed in the Dark Nights of initiation and a new mind/emotion complex is formed under the direct ions of the True Self. Like Osiris we must rise from the death of our old selves into the new. Lord, I die daily. 1 Corinthian s 15:30 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. 2 Cor 5:17 Baptism, Initiation and The Anointing He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repe ntance for the forgiveness of sins. Luke 3:3 Baptism or immersion into water represents the first Initiation on the spiritual Path. It is a ritual recognition of the process of rebirth that has begun. The rite itself is not the same as the rite of Chris tening, there is no Biblical evidence for the initiation of minors. The rite of baptism is by full immersion into water and repr esents the descent of the Old man into death (the water) and r e birth as a new creation. This can be readily seen from Luke 3:3 where Baptism is specifically referred to as the Baptism of Repe ntance. Repentance as discussed earlier involves a radical change of life direction and hence can only be recognised in someone of mature age. Baptism is the first of the Seven Sacraments used by the Gnostic Church. The rite is only available to those who have entered the Path of Transfiguration. Baptism is one of three Initiations offered by the Gnostic Ecclesia: Baptism by Water, Anointing with the Holy Spirit and Celestial Confirmation (Consolomentum). As can be seen from the verse below there are two di stinct forms of Baptism, both of which are available to those on the Terrestrial Path. There is the Baptism of repentance (known scripturally as the Baptism of Water or John's Baptism), and there is the Baptism or Anointing with the Holy Spirit or Fire. (T he Baptism of the Holy Spirit). The Third Initiation, that of the Celestial Class is a unique rite (not a Baptism) and one we w ill not elaborate on in this study. "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 99 So Paul asked, \"Then what baptism did you receive?\" \"John's baptism,\" they r e- plied. Paul said, \"John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that i s, in Jesus.\" On hearing this, they were baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus. Acts 19:3 - 5 The Anointing of the Holy Spiri t is the Baptism with Fire. It is not given with the Baptism of r e pentance but is offered later on the spiritual Path. As the Baptism of repentance is recognition of starting the spiritual Path, the Baptism of Fire is recognition of a certain degree of achiev e- ment and is stimulus for further growth. The Baptism of water symbolises the start of the work of Sophia in cleansing the life o f the student, it also initiates the growth of the Light Spark in the Gnostic. The Baptism of fire recognises the growing Spark of Light and accelerates the d e- struction of the \"old man\" within the Gnostic being. As the Spark of Light grows it attempts to commune with the Mind of God (Lo gos) to which the Gnostic now has access, however, false perceptions and attachments block the way. As the initiate grows Sophia purifies and destroys the blockages between the Self and the Logos. This process is recognised and accelerated by the Initiatio n of Fire. The Spirit baptism also recognises the new Mind and emotion through which the New Man is being formed. Accordingly, a s Sophia acts new gifts and powers are activated. It should be noted that since this Baptism initiates new aspects of the Transf iguration process, it should be only offered to mature Gnostics. An initiate just on the path, so to speak, by taking this Bap tism can bring on internal experiences beyond his maturity, it is no use destroying the mind and emotion until you are ready to relinquish control of them to the New You ! There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men. Now to ea ch one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wi sdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, to another miraculous po w- ers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to s till another the interpretation of tongues. All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines. 1 Corinthians 12:4 - 11 When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 100 because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. Acts 8:15 - 17. Many may argue against separate B aptisms of water and fire and yet clearly in the Book of Acts we have a discussion of the difference between the Baptism in the name of Jesus and the ba p- tism of the Holy Spirit. This also leads us to an understanding of the esoteric meaning of the name Jesus and the Christ. Jesus in symbolism is the human principle. In Gnostic literature the name Jesus was symbolic of the spiritually disciplined life, henc e, Baptism in the name of Jesus is the first Baptism, that of water, that of Discipline, that of Repentance. The Second baptism (or anointing) is that of Fire, it is the Christ Baptism. At this baptism Sophia breaks down the barriers between the new awakened Self (Pneumatic Spark) and the Logos, and the Gnostic e n- ters into communion with the Mind of God. In other words, the Divine Will is present in his soul, he is Christed. Living the L ife of a Gnostic: Overcoming The Dialectic System In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be pers e- cuted, 2 Timothy 3:12 Of great significance on the Path of Transfiguration is actually ‘living the Life’. As part of the Path we offer some guide - lines, these include... 1 Following the Light Within 2 Separation from the World. 3 Fellowship. 4 Life on the Path Each of these offer assistance along the Path, following the Light within includes the guidance we recei ve from the Gnostic tradition. For example, in how we should deal with ourselves and those around us. Separation from the world is of paramount importance. While this is difficult to apply today it is abundantly clear that we are to keep to our own path, a void social contact with those not of the Gnosis, and keep ourselves focused on our own traditions. "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 101 The term fellowship means association, community, communion, joint participation, inte r- course, the share which one has in anything, participation, the right hand as a sign and pledge of fellowship (Strong's Exhausti ve Concordance). It is not simply a social gathering or friendships, but a communion of those of similar heritage and of similar belief. Fellowship certainly assists many on the Spiritual path who find the quest difficult and isolated, however, it is only of value insomuch that the fellowship itself conforms to the dictates of the Gnostic tradition. Life on the Path Life on the spiritual path is difficult, it is a battle between the false perceptions we have inside ourselves (and those outside) and the p ower of Light. In the Gnostic traditions there are many descriptions of this battle and what it entails. Within the modern esote ric traditions this battle is posited in terms of a force called the \" Dweller on the Threshold \". The dweller guards the cros s road between the World of the Archons and the Treasury of light and as the Gnostic a p- proaches this doorway attacks him without mercy, only those truly on the path survive. Some Gnostic systems image this process a s a cosmic trek through the planets where at each planet the soul needs special passwords and gestures to gain \" right of passag e \". For others this battle is seen in terms of an internal quest. For St.John of the cross this process was part of the ascent of Mount Carmel where the Soul would meet its maker. Along the way the soul experiences to r ments and immense pain as it is purified and prepared for the divine marriage with God. Hence the Dark night with its aridities and voids is the means to the knowledge of God and self, although the knowledge given in this night is not as plenteous and abu ndant as that of the other night of spirit, for the knowledge of this might is as it were, be the foundation of the other. (Th e soul experiencing the Dark Night) resembles one who is imprisoned in a dark dungeon, bound hands and feet and able neither to move, nor see, nor feel any favour from heaven or earth. Dark Night of the Soul, St.John of the Cross (N1:12,6 N2:7,3) In wh atever form the dark Night is experienced it is terrifying. It occurs in the spiritual growth of all who follow the Path. After the initial excitement of entering the Path and starting the spir i tual quest, doubts arise; fears; dreams; terrors; a feeling of abandonment, an inability to study, meditate or concentrate. It i s during this period that the \" old \" mind and emotions are d e stroyed, so feelings of death and rebirth are not uncommon. It is a truly shattering occurrence. However, it will be experienced many times along the spiritual path as the lower vehicles are transformed and the New Self grows. An excellent description of this process is found in the li t-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 102 erature of Alchemy. For the Alchemists the substance that was being transformed into Gold was themselves and the procedures refl ected the spiritual Path. The formula of IAO was used as a code to pass on the teachings to their students. The life of the Gn ostic involves the total transformation of the individual from one substance to another and accordingly involves the greatest revolution in consciousness possible. This tran s- formation cannot be readily expressed in words but needs to be experienced. An interesting d e- scription of the transformation is given by Nietszche when he discusses the process of \"overcoming man\" and becoming the Overman and compares the gap between Man and the Overman in the following terms.... I teach you the Overman. Man is something that sha ll be overcome. What have you done to overcome him ? All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flow and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man ? What is the ape to man ? A laughing stock or painful embarrassment. And man shall be just that for the Overman; A laughing stock or a painful emba r- rassment. You have made your way from worm to man; and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape. Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost. But do I bid you to become ghosts or plants ? Behold I teach you the Overman.

This verse prov ides an excellent introduction to the Path of Gnosis. In the Secret Gospel of Mark we have a record of a small segment of the in itiated tradition which survived beneath the gloss of early Christianity. As can readily be seen from the above quote, the inner training i n- volved days of tuition and education as well as a nocturnal initiation, where the teachings of the Kingdom were finally revealed . This certainly is not the Born Again experience of a Southern Baptist ! The Path of the Gnosis or Celestial Salvation is very different from what most people expect. It builds on the foundations of the terrestrial path but goes far beyond them. It is a path for a Chosen few in juxtaposition to that of the Path of the Called few. The Path to Salvation in general terms is only for a small number, therefore the Celestial Path is for an even more mi n- ute elect. It is a special elite Path for the chosen. Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to. Luke 13:24 In the early Gnostic Church the State of Perfection was well recogn ised. To avoid charlatans claiming the state, the church itself verified the achievement. This was known as the Admin i- str a tion of the Mysteries (Ephesians 3:9). This recognition was by a third form of Baptism, a s e- cret rite. This was known as the Consolamentum by the Cathari and could only be offered once in a lifetime. It is rumored that i f someone took this baptism and was not prepared for it, it would destroy them or send them mad.

In some groups they were known as the Living Saints or Perfected Ones. The Cathars knew them as the Parfait. This C e- lestial class, however, did not live like other Christians. Because they had achieved a new state of being they went far beyond the normal restrictions and confines of contemporary morality. As illustrated in the wineskins tale of the New Testament, the Ne w Wine of the Gnosis cannot be poured into old wineskins, according a totally New Man (Light Being, Parfait) must be formed befo re receiving the secret teachings. The New Wine or Esoteric teachings of Jesus were reserved for the Celestial class. And no on e pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out and the win e- skins will be ruined. No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. Luke 5:37,38 This system of graduated knowledge, differ ent teachings for different levels of Salvation is also clearly intimated in the work of Jesus himself. Jesus taught in a carefu lly structured hierarchy composed of The Twelve Disciples, The Seventy and the Multitudes. It can be readily seen that this structure of teaching is mirrored in the Multiple Paths to Salv a- tion. The Celestial path, the Terrestrial Path and the Multitudes who may follow the ethical codes but do not enter the Path. It is not simple to explain the nature of the Celestial Path nor the calling to it. However, it is imperative for the Gnostic to k now the voice when it comes, for the Celestial path is a special calling bringing unique opportunities as well as many dangers. Celestial Transfiguration Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth in me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my F a- ther. John 14:12 The calling to the Celestial Path is a special one. It echoes across lifetimes bringing the Parfait to higher and higher levels of development, until, at an appointed time perfection is achieved. This state of Perfection is a unique stat e of being. It is one where the Gnostic is in tune with the Mind of God (Logos) and his actions embody the Holy Spirit (Sophia). This state of \"Walking in the Light\" represents a special achievement of spiritual regeneration. It is the full manifest a- tion of the Covenant of the Mysteries and is represented by a very small group of humanity."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 105 Now it is fitting that the soul regenerate herself and become again as she fo r- merly was.

This is the way of the ascent to the Father. The Exegesis of the Soul. Nag Hammadi Library II 134:6 - 15. The process of achieving Celestial Transfiguration involves a range of complex spiritual tran s- formations. It begins with the traditional Terrestrial Path and after a period known as The Dark Night of the Soul, a special c alling is experienced. This calling is unique to each one called, and is a harrowing experience, which shakes the soul to its ve ry core. The Gnostic is then lead through secret and inner interpretations of Scripture and practise (by a teacher or Hierarch) and then into an experience of full regeneration. Usually this process is achieved over many lif e- times and in keeping with the coming End of Time many Parfait are now awakening into the C e lestial State. The amazing thing about this state is that it goes further than simply returning the \"soul \" to Pe r fection (Terrestrial Salvation) but actually transfigures the Self to become a member of the God family while in life ! This state of Perfection (Teleios) is inherent within the concept of spiritual rebirth and the n a- ture of the New Man in Christ. As a Gnostic is reborn in the image of God, then the implication is that it is possible to fully reflect the nature of God. This obviously entails perfection. Some Biblical references will help you get some background... Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. Matthew 5:48 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by t he mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable se r vice.

To be privy to the very mind of God is to be beyond all Law and M oral restrictions. For the Lord himself is not bound by any law or regulation, neither is the Perfected Parfait.

It is because of the unique nature of the Parfait and their missions for the Lord of Wisdom that a state of \" living beyond the Law \" must be achieved. The law is a product of the fallen world and is of some significance with in the earthly kingdoms. However, when a Parfait goes beyond the world and is living as a being in the Treasury of Light (only t emporarily in the lower world) then obviously he is not under earthly law.

This state of perfection and union with the Mind of God is imperative so the Pa r- fait can achieve the specials tasks the Lord of Wisdom requires of them. While those of Terre s- trial Salvation may continue to reincarnate to teach and assist until being resurrected unto pe r- fection.

If th erefore it be the Will of God that I should commit sin, my will must be the same, and I must not desire even to abstain from sin The Book of Nine Rocks. (Beghards) The fascinating thing about this Amorality is that it is a higher form of Ethics. As discu ssed in our earlier lessons with reference to Buddhism, both attachment and detachment are \"actions and reactions\" and hence gov erned by the Dialectic world. Real asceticism or Celestial ethics comes from being beyond all forms of morality and that include s attachment and detachment. This is embodied in the message found in many Gnostic Gospels. For example in the Gospel of Thomas we read....Whoever has come to understand the world has found a corpse, and wh o- ever has found a corpse is superior to the world. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. Galations 5:18 This state can be philosophically understood in the sense that the Laws of the lower world took the role of a schoolmaster and h ence when the Gnostic has graduated from school, the Law is no longer necessary, it has achieved its purpose. Other explanations could include that Morality is the raft left behind when you have crossed the river and achieved perfection and that after the Flames of Sophia have consumed all sin nothing is left but perfection.

Galations 3:24,5 The Parfait There are many groups thro ughout history whose legacy is still found today in the continuation of the Gnostic Ecclesia. One of the most important was the Cathari. The Cathars means \"The Pure Ones\" , the term comes from the Greek word Katharos which is translated the purified. Within western Europe these early Gnostics appeared in northern France and the Low Countries toward the late 11th or early 12th century. Persecuted and expelled from the north, the Cathars travelled south and found success in the semi - independent province of Languedoc and the su r- rounding areas. Here they became known as Albigenses. It is believed the Cathars originally d e- rived from sects such as the Bogomils and Paulicians who originated in such regions as Arm e- nia, Syria and Asia Minor. The Cathars or Albigenses were a distinctly Gnostic sect believing strongly in the Dualism between the Higher and lower worlds and identified the creator of ma t- ter with the Demiurge. This creator they called the Rex Mundi or King of the World. They ce n- tred their worship on God the Father and the manifestation of the Logos in his Son. They strongly opposed the ecclesiastical hie rarchy and they held that the traditional Christian church, with its corrupt clergy and its immense material wealth, was the age nt of Satan and was to be avoided. The Roman Catholic Church initially attempted to reconvert the Albigenses through subtle means. When every attempt failed, Pope Innocent III launched the Albigensian Crusade (circa 1209 - 29) that annihilated the Albig enses and desolated much of southern France. Small groups of Albigenses survived in isolated areas but were pursued by the Inqui sition. One of the central Cathari rituals was that of the Consolamentum, a special form of adult ba p- tism which could be administered only once. It was reserved only for those special Cathars who had attained the level of the \" P erfected Ones \". It is believed the rite was preceded by a fast, various ritual forms of preparation and given by the laying on of hands. This rite was taken so seriously that anyone who profaned it by returning to a \" material life \" was expelled from t he community. The Believers, or Credentes were those of the Terrestrial Path and followed a similar path to that of the Perfected Ones, however perfection was not r e- quired of them. The Cathari form a major link in the lineage of the Modern Mysteries and su s- tained the Esoteric teachings while under persecution from the apostate Church and transmitted them, via small sects and cults, to today's Gnostics. "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 109 Wisdom from India To give an example from Hinduism of the Amoral Path. We find in traditional Hindu (Tantric - Vedic) Tantra ther e are two distinct traditions, The Right and Left Hand Path. These have not h ing to do with White and Black magic as the ignorant suggest but are two distinct metho d- ologies of redemption. The Right hand Path is symbolic and the images regarding sexuality are applied symbolically with strict moral codes enforced. The Left Hand Path is literal and uses the very things that the Right Hand Path condemns to achieve liber ation. These two paths have many similarities to the Terrestrial and Celestial traditions. For more information we can turn to J ulius Evola's excellent text The Yoga of Power for details of the different traditions within the Buddhist Tantra's... There is a significant difference between the two Tantric paths, that of the Right hand and that of the Left hand. In the former the ad ept always experiences someone above him even at the hig h est level of realisation. In the latter he becomes the Ultimate Sovereign . In the Buddhist Tantras, Buddha paradoxically uphol ds the relativity of every moral precept, the uselessness of worship, the insignificance of the five precepts of early Buddhism, and even of the triple homage of the Buddhist tradition in terms so blunt that at monastic gatherings the Bodhisattvas who are on their way toward enlightenment faint (the terrestrial Path) while the Tathagatas (Celestial Path) the enlightened ones remain unmoved.

These discussions are also found in many other esoteric eastern works. For example the Manava - Dharmashatra, one of the older Indo - Aryan works, flaunts the great powers that a Brahman has and how far he has come bey ond the law. The example we earlier gave regarding the fire which removes all impurity is repeated many times with the resulting perfectionist state emphasised. This tradition of Amorality arising from total achievement of divinity is cha r acteristic of the inner Mystery tradition in both the east and the West. Throughout all per i- ods of Church history right up until today secret sects have upheld the perfectionist doctrine, these have ranged from the Brethren of the Free Spirit to the Cathars and modern Gnostic O r- ders. Certainly the Gnostic Gospels (Nag Hammadi) well illustrate the Perfectionist teaching. The focus on being beyond the Law also includes the sinless state, because, theoretically, if one is beyond the Law then there can be no sin as sin is recognised only by the conviction of the Law."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 110 Where there is no Law, there is no sin Romans 5:13 He who has knowledge of the Truth is a free man, but the free man does not s in, for who sins is the slave of sin Gospel of Phillip 1:20 While, of course, Celestial Transfiguration does not accept or condone the misuse of the pe r- fect state (perhaps that in itself is proof of a lack of perfection !), it is quite clear that many of the secret teachings incl uded within the technology of Transfiguration use methods that are way beyond the conventional morality of \" modern \" western Ch ristianity. While we realise this may come as a quite a shock for those accustomed to the morality of \" Fundamentalist Christians \", the evidence for such an inner tradition which leads to a state beyond Law is found in all early Gnostic teaching s. We are not however encouraging \" free for all \" morality since it is clear that the Celestial Path is for the few and far be tween and can destroy those who enter it unprepared. However, for those of a special calling a life beyond conventional Law and Ethics will be the result. The actual Path of Celestial Transfiguration involves a special spiritual technology which was revealed by Jesus after his resurrection to his disciples, with f i- nal revelations being given to Paul in what are now known as the Mysteries. The Secret of the Qadesh Jesus said \" When you m ake the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside, and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below an d when you make the male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be male nor the female female.....then you will e nter the Kingdom \". The Gospel of Thomas 2:38. Within the oldest Gnostic traditions we find that a further division is made wi thin the spiritual classes. The Psychic or Dove class are allowed to reproduce (though not encouraged) and in fulfil the role of creating children, however, those of the Serpent class are not permitted to r e- produce and in the many traditions were defined as gender - variant or homosexual. This fact alone explains a lot about descriptio ns of the Essenes and others being celibate, the meaning of course, was more non - reproductive than altogether non - sexual. This e arly tradition centred on a special priestclass known as the Qadesh or Holy ones, they sustained the Mysteries and were the inne rmost initiates. As the Bible fell into the hands of the extremist and literalist scribes this class was expunged from the text and homosexuals and the gender variant were turned into the most evil of all criminals. Of course, this was a simple way for the apostate scribes to write themselves into history and the original priestclass out !"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 111 There are so many examples of the Qadesh class hidden within the Old Testament, the \"coat of many colours\" for example, was a r itual garment worn by a Sumerian gender - variant priest, in the Bible the coat survives but the context does not. It seems clear for example that the story of Sodom and Gomorrah was actually a tale re - moulded by the scribes to suggest a battle between two r eligious traditions that of the town of Sodom or Qadesh and the warrior cult of Yahweh. There are many other Biblical examples, certainly the homo - erotic relationship between David and Jonathan in the Old Testament springs to mind. While we do not wish to belabour the point certainly all early Aryan traditions suggest a special elite homosexual (or at least gender var i- ant) priestly class. The Epic of Gilgamesh has a special relationship between Gilgamesh and E n kidu, the Druids and Celts were renowned for homosexual priest activity and certainly the Shaman traditions of early cultures fo cused on gender variant activity. This understanding of reproduction is central to the Gnostic view of sexuality. While reprodu c- tion may be necessary for the propagation of the species, it is by its very nature difficult as it tends to bring our focus back towards the material world. Accordingly, those who choose this path can only be initiated into the Path of the Dove, in future lives it was envisaged in the old texts they would reincarnate in forms suitable to enter the Qadesh priesthood. The reason be hind the Qadesh priesthood is quite simple. Reproduction has an energy field which gravitates towards propagation of the species and hence sustaining the material world. Accordingly though this field can be modified and a certain liberation achieved (the p ath of the Dove) only by total rejection of this field can full liberation be gained. While a heterosexual can certainly achieve this, it is probably more difficult for them to reject the reproductive urges pr o- grammed in their cellular structure than for a homosexual. At the same time the Path of the Se r- pent is non - discriminatory, reproduction and reproductive values are the issue, not sexual pre f- e r ence. The aim therefore, for those on the terrestrial path is to control the influence of the Di a- lectic field. If reproduction is necessary, and in the Kali Yuga we do have some doubts about it, then we should apply health rules to ensure the best possible bodies for the incarnation of f u- ture souls. The aim, however, of the Celestial Path and the Qadesh is obviously very different. The Bridal Chamber The aim of those on the celestial path is to achieve liberation in the body, accordingly the e n- ergy fields of the organism must be transformed to a point whereby they will survive the effect of the manifestation of the Pneu matic Spark from the Treasury of Light. Therefore many of the technologies of the Celestial path use methods which actually change the energy form of the o r- ganism One of the central techniques used is known as the Bridal Chamber.

The Bridal chamber is based on the process of Solve et coagula. After the instincts and mind have been \"destroyed\" and reformed, the two poles of the electrom agnetic organism (Astral Body) are stimulated and at their union the Shekinah awakens. (The Shekinah or presence is that part of God which is locked in the lower worlds and awaits redemption) As the Shekinah awakens it rises to the higher planes and re - uni tes with the Sophia. This rite is central to many Gnostic traditions and is the pre - requisite for the Consolamentum or The Sacrament of Perfe c- tion. Again, we understand that this new appreciation of sexuality and its practical use within the Celestial path may be diffic ult for those used to the straight - jacket morality of many modern religions. However, we can perhaps best defend our position in this regards, by repeating some of the d e- fences used by an Abbess in the trial of a 18th Century Dominician Order of Saint Catherine, which was accused of immoral conduc t.. As our spirit is free, it is only the intention that can make an action wicked. It is enough, therefore, to lift ourselves in our minds to God and then nothing is si n- ful. To practise that which we mistakenly call impurity is true purity, which God wishes and bids us to practise and without whi ch we have no way of finding God, who is Truth. Vie de Sciptone de Ricci . Brussels 1895     "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Restoring the Bible When we consider the Bible and the nature of the Gnostic tradition we need to grapple with many questions. The first major issue is the corruption and distortion that has crept into the B i- ble and the process of restoring it to its original Gnostic form. The process of restoring the B i- ble is a difficult task because it involves a wide range of problems. Obviously, there is the si m- ple issue of what books should be in the Bible, what books have been edited and changed and what texts have been tampered with. But there is far more, there are many sections in the Bible which have been added in, words have been translated in obscure and contradictory ways and terms which had specific applications at the time of writing have been twisted out of context. Still, thi s is a beginning, and the first step to Biblical understanding is context. So much of the Bible can only be comprehended in term s of the surrounding passages, the flow of the book and the period it was written in. The verse structure of the Bible is artifi cial, it was only added in for ease of reading with modern translations, hence, many of the stops, passage divisions and paragra ph forms, which we take for granted, are simply arbitrary. To give you a classic e x ample - what did the criminal on the cross actually say to Jesus in Luke 23:43 ? And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise or And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee To day, shalt thou be with me in paradise. There were no comma's in the original edition, so did Jesus say that the criminal would be in paradise today ( ie. ascend to heaven on his death) or did Jesus simply say the criminal would be in paradise sometime and simply use a turn of p hrase to intimate how he was speaking, \" I say unto thee today \". This is a clear example of how modern grammatical composition, when added into the Bible, can be used to produce misleading theology. In the above example, we see how certain denominations u sing modern translations are able to use the first form of the verse in an attempt to prove that we go straight to Heaven when we die. Even though this co n- cept is based on a dubious use of grammar, especially dubious if we understand that the gra m- mar was added in by translators for easy reading; nothing more, nothing less. Chapter Twelve: Chapter Twelve: Restoring the Bible Restoring the Bible"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 114 What about the Old Testament ? The Gnostic attitude towards the Old Testament is ambivalent to say the least. The major issue i s that it was written during the Babylonian captivity and edited to fit the prevailing Pharisaic form of Judaism that existed at that time. The fact is the Old Testament was written at the same time as the Babylonian Talmud and other questionable Edomite/Judaic texts. In this context it b e- comes clear that the Old Testament as we have it is not a Gnostic or Israelite text, but a text di s- torted to fit the Talmudic Jewish tradition. Accordingly, it mixes together accounts from a wide variety of sources and contexts with little thought to their integrity and original meaning. We can deduce that there are at least four Old Testament strands a nd these are in addition to the original Israelite Gnosis. This original gnosis was sustained by secrecy and taught mouth to ear (Kabbalah) by a small Pneumatic class, little of this tradition has been recorded in the Biblical a c counts. Accordingly, the Old Testament is of extremely limited value. Most of the terms, words and concepts used are based on th e original Israelite mystery language (Hebrew) and hence some of the esotericism may be coaxed out of the text, but this is not simple and is e x- tremely time consuming. Regardless of the Esotericism, we must be clear about the nature of the Old Testament in its cu r- rent form. The Gnostic view is that if you followed the traditions in the Old Testament as they presently are, you would be ensl aving yourself under Archons rather than liberating yourself through the Aeons. The Laws, Covenants and other agreements are sur e signs of the enslavement of mans spirit by the Archon Yahweh, they illustrate how distorted the Old Testament really is. From a historical perspective there is little of the original Israelite teachings in the Old Test a- ment. When we contemplate that Israel and environs had various religious traditions including Gnostic (Esotericism), the EL tradition (Canaanite Paganism), various strands of EL and Ya h- weh Worship and then later, the Priestclass of the Pharisees, one can start to get the picture of how distorted and confused th e Old Testament really is. It is a sign of extreme credulity if not st u pidity for Christians to try and interpret the whole Old Testament as a coherent early revel a- tion and it does little for their intellectual integrity. Bible Narratives Biblical criticism has shown that there are at lea st four intermingled narratives within the Old Testament, most of which specifically seem to be in conflict. The Epic tradition seems to date from the original Exodus while the Priestly tradition dates from the Babylonian captivity. This second narrative w as probably written by a literalist Priestclass who had little knowledge of the true meaning of the tradition. Therefore, it is clear that most sections of the Old Testament have been re - worked. A number of examples may help you to get the overall picture. In the Epic Tradition the original covenant includes the Ten Words or Ten commandments only,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 115 while the Priestly tradition includes the Covenant code laws. (These laws could not have been written at the Exodus as they inc lude agricultural regulations and references to the Canaanites which obviously originate after their settlement in Palestine). In the Epic Tradition the Covenant Code was an adaptation of the Ten Words into civil law yet we can show how this code has bee n re - written time and time again (producing the Priestly Ve r sion) and moved back into Scripture in an attempt to prove that the latest set of laws were actually written by Moses. In the Epic Tradition Moses crosses the Reed Sea (not the Red Sea) when the wind blows the waves apart (this still occurs today), the emphasis being on God using nature to achieve a mir a- cle. The Priestly tradition has Moses raising his arms and opening the Red Sea, this second tr a- d i tion emphasises the nearly magical power of Moses and hence, by inference, the occult power of the later Priesthood. In the Epi c Tradition there are eight plagues upon Egypt, in the Priestly tradition, Ten. These differences, and many others, are major a nd show that while in Babylon the Pharisees mixing Babylonian Paganism and Judaism not only wrote such texts as the Talmud but also e d- ited together the Old Testament. Hence, the task of restoration becomes even more daunting and reference to documents such as th e Dead Sea Scrolls becomes imperative. A further issue is with the clear intimation that the Bible has an inner meaning. Certain ly the oral tradition of the Israelites known as \" Kabbalah \" taught the Bible had at least three levels and the modern Biblical scholar Barbara Thiering outlines how the Essenes used a \" Pesher \" code to hide certain Mysteries from the profane. All these things must be considered when we start to quote the Bible or use Scripture to prove a certain viewpoint. The Gnostic Apostolic Church is working hard to help in the restoration of the Bible to its original purity and to rei n- state the esoteric or Mystery teachings that are central to real Christianity. Multiple Levels of Truth Inherent within the My stery teachings is the understanding that Truth is a complex and multi - faceted thing and cannot be reduced to simple doctrine or dogma. Accordingly, within the a n- cient Gnostic teachings there was a clear understanding that there were (and are) multiple levels on which Truth operates. When St.Paul discusses in Hebrews that there is Solid Food and there is milk or infant food in regards to Truth , he is simply re - ite rating the teaching of multiple truth levels. In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 116 food! Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil. Hebrews 5:12. The importance of these multiple levels cannot be underestimated, for inherent within them is the way in which the Lord of Wisdom reveals himself to man. Jesus certainly acknowledged these triple levels in the way in which he taught his message. There is clear evidence wit hin the New Testament that Jesus used Parables to reveal certain teachings to different classes of disc i- ples. In this structure of teaching there is wisdom for the Multitudes (the people of Israel), the Seventy and for the Twelve Di sciples and these levels clearly refer to the three degrees of truth. The disciples came to him and asked, \"Why do you speak to the people in pa r- ables?\" He replied, The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. Matthew 13: 10 - 12 The Bible is a part of ancient religion which was both exoteric and esoteric. The o logians fail to recognise that they have but the outer shell, although Jesus made the existence of an inner teaching very clear. Anciently, religion was d i- vided into three degrees and man spent his life mastering them. Dr.R.S.Clymer Traditionally, deeper levels of meaning are under stood as occurring in three different degrees, now, that doesn't mean a verse cannot have seven or ten different meanings (some definitely do), but that generally the Bible is focused on a triple level of interpretation. To help explain this I will give yo u a range of different examples showing how different Biblical verses and co n cepts can have multiple meanings and that even some of these multiple meanings can lead to other multiple meanings ! For exampl e, the Seven Churches may be studied on multiple levels.      Level One Seven Churches of Revelation as literal historical Ch urches. Level Two Seven Churches as seven periods in development of the Ecclesia (Church) on   Earth. "},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 117 Level Three Seven Churches as representation of the seven locations with the organism   (Chakras). With related associations t o the Seven Planes and Seven Bodies. Now, you may say, \" Come on ! you want us to believe that Scripture can apply on all the se levels \" .Well, just take a look at the Churches of Revelation. Not only do the specific descri p- tions regarding attributes of each Church (with very specific outlines of their good and bad points) fit perfectly into the fram ework of the seven periods of Church history which span from the first century to the present. But these attributes link perfect ly with both the traditional Hindu and western descriptions of the qualities and dangers found in each Chakra centre. Coinc i- dence ? Unlikely ! These multiple levels of truth are imperative for without them it is impossible to grasp the ove r- all picture. Just like you build a house in stages, Truth comes in stages and only when you have grasped Level One are you able to expand and deepen your understanding into Levels Two, Three and so on. In the many volumes published by the Church we follow the same principle, lesson will build on lesson, chapter on chapter. So, if some of the earlier material seems too si m ple or not to go far enough, wait until the building blocks are laid onto the foundation.

And lets be clear about it, without a firm foundatio n the house will fall ! Continuing Revelation One of the keynotes of the Gnostic system is the revelation is personal, that is to say, that Rev e- lation as found in the many thousands of sacred texts is only sacred to those people who accept that they are sacred. The variou s Gnostic Scriptures are useful to the modern Gnostic student but should not be treated as \"every word inspired by God\". One of the more important things when it comes to Scripture is mans reason. We need to study the historical basis for the Bible, Gnosti c Texts, Dead Sea Scrolls and Nag Hammadi Library so we can get a context for where Gnosticism has come from. At the same time w e must be aware of the great distortions that have occurred with all Old Testament, Judaic and Christian texts. The key concept within Gno s- ticism is continual revelation. We can also see the development of Gnostic doctrine and Th e- urgy in light of recent research and experience. Continual revelation while of significant impo r- tance always needs to be seen in the context of the Gnostic lineage, anybody can have a revel a- tion and they can come from any one of a million sources. The modern Gnostic tradition as e x- emplified in the Institute of Gnostic Studies carries on this line of spiritual and Gnostic revel a- tion valuing our heritage and traditions as well as well as recent refinements and revelations. Behind the Institute if the Gnostic Apostolic Church, this is our inspiration and the religious a p- plication of our work. We should consider some aspects of the Church as part of this study."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Churches and Temples In the Gnostic Apostolic Church we realise that a \"Temple of the Gnosis\" is a permanent doo r- way between the worlds and hence we create two distinct environments for use within the Church. The Actual term Church comes fro m the base word \"Ecclesia\" and means people and/ or community, hence within the Church we use the Church building as a meeting pl ace, a cou n seling centre and a nucleus for Church activity within the congregation. Our Churches are where services of a worshipful and cel ebratory nature are held. The Temple of the Gnosis is a different affair. In it both initiations and ritual are held which have special power as the Temple forms a permanent intersection between worlds. It is a place of great power and beauty and sho uld always be treated as such. In the Gnostic Apostolic Church both Churches and Temples are governed by ordained ministers of o ur tradition, even though laymen are encouraged to developed private \"Spiritual\" spaces within their own homes for their own use The Use of Ritualism Ritual is a means by which we can formulate an artificial world in which internal realities (and other s piritual worlds) can be explored. Through ritual the conscious mind is controlled and the unconscious is explored and conditione d so that external realities from beyond the physical plane can be investigated, other spiritual powers contacted and other dime nsions opened. The key to ritual is that it must have two distinct forms. The first must always be the training of the mind, th e exploration of the unconscious and a clear and precise understanding of the structure of your own psyche. Then and only then a re you ready to enter into work of a more advanced spiritual nature. Before ritual can become a doorway to other dimensions, it is i m- perative that the mind is trained and under control, otherwise, as is the case with so many u n- trained spiritual practitioners, obsession and delusion result. Beyond all these considerations is the simple issue of intent. W hile techniques of ritual and occultism can be remarkably similar across all traditions that does not make them qualitatively th e same. A knife can be used to heal and to kill, so can the occult traditions. The focus must be on Transfiguration and then r itual and related methodologies can be used, however, the intent must always be clear and pure.

The Monastic Life In the Gnostic Apostolic Church we have three levels of Priesthood. The basic minister or pa s- tor of the Church, the Senior Pastor who is a member of the Pneumatic Priesthood who has ho w ever decided to continue working within his or her pastoral duties and those of the Qadesh Priesthood. Members of the Qadesh Priesthood have vowed himself/herself to the Gnostic trad i- tion. They are celibate, but in a special sense, they are encouraged to have full sex lives but to keep focus on the True Self a nd the Lineage of the Gnosis. Spiritual and sexual partnerships are permitted, but the duties the priesthood must come first. A s discussed in early chapters, the Se n ior Pastors and Qadesh Priesthood are members of the Pneumatic priesthood and are non - reproductive, whether they be heterosexual or homosexual in orientation. Members of the Qadesh Priesthood are usually homosexual. The Gnostic Tradition: A Brief history of the Church It is difficult to encapsulate the history of the Gnostic tradition. However, it is fair to say that it began in the time of the great Sumerian and Egyptian kingdoms and was passed down, at first in oral form, (Cf.Kabbalah \" passed by mouth \") through esoteric brotherhoods. In the west this knowledge was passed onto the initiate (Jesus) in the Essene Sect, after hi s death his followers passed on the secret teachings. This new order centred around Ormus (46 A.D.) and continued through the Kn ights Templars, the Eleutherians, the Church of Carmel, the Rosicrucians and o n wards. In modern times the lineage continued in a variety of forms, the more ritually oriented line was continued in such organi sations as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the early Theosophical movements, the Astrum Argentinum, the Ordeo Templi Orientis and the Frate r- nity of Saturn (Germany). However, these organisations got bogged down in the technology of the spiritual processes and lost the vision and art of the Gnosis. Hence modern reresentatives of such organisations and others found in the \"ritual magic(k)\" commu nity have little in common with the real Gnostic legacy. Various mystical brotherhoods have also arisen claiming to follow the G nosis, but these have, in the most, tended to be Liberal Christian organisations who have still not realised the complete framework of the Gnostic system. Most are simply supposed Li b- eral minded Christians who are sick of modern Christianity but do not have the illumination of the Gnostic traditions. The Gnost ic Apostolic Church has developed out of the work of Pastor Robert Ledwidge who, after studying a wide range of spiritual tradi tions and systems, came to a realisation of the nature of the Gnostic legacy and its ramifications in religious, political and d e- velopmental fields. "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 121 The Role and Purpose of the Gnostic Apostolic Church The Gnostic Apostolic Church is a modern manifestation of the current which has been wor k- ing to redeem man from the prison of matter. Throughout history there has been a continuum of secret Churches or Ecclesias which have carried on the Mysteries of the Gnosis. The Gnostic Apostolic Church is representative of the Remnant Ecclesia that carrie s on the Gnosis in the Age of the Wolf. The Gnostic Apostolic Church is the title used for the general religious oper a- tions of the Brethren, it symbolizes our focus on the Restoration of the original Gnosis. The term Ecclesia or Church is not sim ply an organisation or a group of people aiming for the same goal though it includes these. It is a special spiritual nucleus w hich invigorates those who join it and motivates them in their quest for self awareness. The Institute for Gnostic Studies is us ed to further the educational aspects of the Church’s mission. Membership and Priesthood Membership in The Gnostic Apostolic C hurch can be divided into five classes; 1 Associate. 2 Full Membership. 3 Priesthood. 4 Senior and Monastic Priesthood. 5 Counc il Membership. These five classes represent the various levels of specialisation within the Church structure. Associate Membe rship is available to anyone who has a general interest in the Church. Full Membership can be divided into two classes: Full M embership (General). This is available to any present or past student of our Church’s training texts (such as this One) issued through the Institute for Gnostic Studies who has an interest in the Churches on going work. Full Membership (Initiate). This i s available to those who have completed Church training courses and have been initiated but do not wish to apply for ordination. "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 122 Due to recent changes in the flow of the ages (the acceleration of the Kali Age), our present p o s i- tion is that only those who agree to forgo reproduction can become full members of the Church. Those already with children can j oin as long as they agree to not have any further children. Those who already have families are eligible to join as full members (General or Initiate) but ca n not enter the priesthood without special permission from the Council. The Priesthood can also be divided into three classes: Priesthood (General).

Sacraments of the Church The Gnostic Apostolic Church acknowledges seven sacraments, these are: 1 Nam ing. 2 Baptism. 3 Ordination. 4 Union. 5 Illumination. 6 Rites of Passing. 7 Feasts and Festivals. "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" The Gnostic Handbook Page 123 In connection with these the Church also acknowledges Healing Sacraments and the Sacred Eucharist. Naming Rituals are similar t o Baptisms, they welcome a child into the world and give a special protection for that child. However, they do not lock a child into any specific form of religious practice or tradition. As our Church no longer encourages reproduction this rite is of limited i m- portance. Baptism recognises the great spiritual changes which take place during this period. These rites, sometimes known as \" Rites of Water and Fire\" are somewhat similar to confirmation however, they confirm a persons entry into adulthood as well as i nto a spiritual life. Ordination. Ordination is that special sacrament that confirms a persons spiritual calling. In the tradit ions of the Gnostic Apostolic Church it has two distinct forms, General and Qadesh. Each has its own specific vows and requirem ents. Rites of Union. These are the rites of Union (they are available for either heterosexual or hom o- sexual relationships of stability).. Illumination is the sacrament given to acknowledge the achieving of a state of spiritual enligh t- e n ment. It is a real sacrament of \" Sainthood \" not the frail imitation the apostate Church u p- holds. It is only given to the highest initiates of the Path of the Serpent. The Rite of Passing is the rite which guides a per son through the time of death into the afterlife, it has much in common with the rites of the Egyptian and Tibetan Books of the dead. In the Gno s tic traditions there are various rites of passing, including rituals for those left behind, rites for those passing away, rites for over the body, rites for just after death and so forth. Feasts and Festivals . These are various religious celebrations whic h occur during the year. Communion .
