Scarcely any department of theological science h as, in the last few d ecades, received such marked attent ion and cultivation as that branch for which the Germans hav e adopted the felicitous appe llatio n Neutestamentli che Zeit geschicht e, —the study of the a ge of Christ in its political, social, and rel igio us aspe cts. Observa nt readers will not have failed to detect that the tendency of modern ev angelical theol ogy i s t o transfer the centre of interest from the wo rk of Christ to the perso n of Chr ist. Ha nd in ha nd, and in clo se connection with this general tendenc y, certain auxiliary branches have assumed an importanc e hitherto not attributed to them. When the person of Christ forms the cynosu re of all eyes, his surroun dings proportionally grow in interest and i mportance; a nd hence it is not surp rising that so much acumen and l earning have been employed in the truly fascinating study of the Palestin e of Christ’s day in all its relations. The central su n casts its rays of respl endent light o n ever-day obj ects, a nd these become prom inent i n prop ortio n as the y refl ect this light. In more t han one respec t the Bo ok of Enoch is an i mpor tant f actor in thes e invest igat ions. Being one of the oldest speci mens of apoca lyptic literature ; reflecting in its different parts the convi ctions, feeling s, and longings of the peop le of God a t different stages of thei r development; written in i mitation of the spirit of the pr ophet s, with r eligi ous pur poses a nd spir itual object s; it c an saf ely be said t o be an inval uable a id to t he understanding of the religio us and moral a tmosphere in which the Saviour live d. It does not belong merely to the curiosities of literature, b ut is a book o f posi tive w orth, and the source of much infor mati on to the patient invest igator. This will suffic e as an apol ogy f or a ne w tra nslat ion of Enoch. In the translation the objec t has been to render as literally as possible, eve n if thereby the English should become a little harsh. Of course the not es do not pretend to u nravel all the mysteries in this mos t mysterious of books; but it is h oped they will be of some assistance in und erstanding these in tricacies. Natural ly, th e se and the Introductio n are, in par t, a compilat ion; but the thoughts of ot hers have been used with judgm ent and discrimina tion, and the sour ces are ind icated. In all questions the writer h as been independ ent, as will be seen by the fac t that he has freque ntly d epart ed fro m beat en pat hs. Much remains yet t o be done before t his book will be entirely underst ood. Both its co nnection in sentiment and expression with the O ld Testament, as well as its influen ce on Talmudic and Rabbinical lore, especially the latter, must, to a great extent, be the w ork o f futur e invest igat ions.

The first i s the oldest son o f Cain (Gen. iv. 17); the second, the son of Jar ed (Gen . v. 18); the thi rd, the son of Midian (Gen. x xv. 4); the fo urth, t he oldest son of Reuben (Gen. xlvi. 9; E x. vi. 14).¹ Of the se the second alone is of importance and interest for us, not o nly on accoun t of t he myst erious prominence gi ven him in Gen. v., but especially from the fact that an inspired writ er of the New Testa ment, Jude, in his letter ver. 14, mentions him as a prophet , and produces a quota tion f rom a book a ttrib uted to the patriarch. The existence of such a bo ok does not, however, rest on the authority of this statement alone; but in the early li terature of the church th ere is a whole chain of evidences to this effect. Nearly all of the churc h Fathers knew of an apocryphal Book o f Enoch, and their description of the work and citat ions fr om it prove satis facto rily that i t was v irtua lly t he same a s that which now lies be fore us . Amon g the A posto lic Fa thers, the Epi stle o f Barn abas r efers t o such a work.

Follow ing the first method, we natur ally begin w ith the comparison of the version o f the Bible, tra nslated in the early days of Christianity among the Eth iopians, not from the Hebrew, bu t from the Septuagint. Here only one authority has a right to speak, the edito r of the Octateuchus Aethiopicus, Prof . Dill mann. A s lat e as 1877, after years of dil igent resear ch on this subject, his judgm ent of this tr anslation a nd its relati on to the Gree k is as follow:¹ “With regard to the translat ion, it must be sa id that it is a ver y fait hful o ne, gen erall y givi ng the Greek text verbatim, often even the rel ative positi on of the wor ds; it abbreviat es only now a nd then whatever seemed superfluous, and m ust, on the whole , be called a successful and happy versio n. Notwithstanding its entire fidel ity to the Gr eek tex t it i s very r eadabl e and, e sp ec ially in t he historical bo oks, smooth, a nd fr equently coincides with the meaning and w ords of the Old Testa ment in a surpr ising manner. Of c ours e there is a difference i n this respect betw een the different bo oks. The Ethiopic translato rs were by no mea ns very lear ned men, and had not a n absol ute com mand o f the G reek l angua ge; esp ecial ly whe n they ha d t o translate rare words and technic al terms this clearly appears, and conse quently ¹ Cf. H erzog, Re al-E ncy klo pä die (2d edit ion), v ol. I . p. 204. 8 some misunderstandin gs and mistakes have cre pt i nto the text thro ugh the fault o f the transla tors.” This version of the Old Te stament is, then, on the whole, a faithful copy of the Septuagint. The same must be said of the trans lation of Pastor Hermae, although here “the sin s of omi ssion” are much more frequent, especially i n Similitudi nes iv., v., and vi., whi ch are rather an epitome of the Greek than a trans lati on. Po sitive mista kes do, indeed, now a nd then o ccur,¹ b ut the m ain dev iati ons fro m the Greek are found in the omissions . These are by no means of much importance as to contents, except possibly in Sim. v. 2, and it would be difficult t o decide who made these omissions, w hether they were a lready found in the original of the trans lato r, or i ntrodu ced by hi m, or are to be ascribed to a copyist.² A close c omparison between the Ethiopic and the Greek text proves conclusive ly that the former is what can be called a good translati on. As the Greek text of the Physiologus has nev er been issue d in a critical edition, a reliable examination of the fidelity of the old Et hiopic transl ation can scar cely be made, yet the evidences seem sufficient to justify an opinion eq ually as fa vorable as tha t passed on the versi on of the Bible and on Pastor Hermae.³ The Greek text of the Asce nsio Isaiae recently dis covered, and pub lished by Geghardt in Hilgen feld’s Zeitschri ft für wiss enschaft.

This opinion is co nfirmed by an examina tion of the r emaining fra gments of the G reek text. Comparing our text with that of Syncellus it is at once apparen t that they do not a lway s agre e.

As we are in t his examinati on restricted t o inner evidences alone, to the harmony or disharmony in style and sentiment, it will be necessar y to inquire w hat evidences the book itsel f furnishes for the solut ion of this problem. It is import ant to noti ce that certai n portions cl aim to be re velations not of Enoch, but of Noah, a nd this fact alo ne is sufficient to force the a cceptance of a different author, The book pretend s to be a revelation given to Eno ch, and as it cont ains revelati ons given to Noah after the death of Enoch, we must conclude that these latt er are part s fore ign to the or igina l wor k. Here we have first the whole of chap. 60 given “in the year five hundred of the lif e of Noah,”¹ co ncerning the flo od, as the most important ev ent in the life of that patr iarch. The difference in style and sentiment, such as the masculine a nd feminine wat er, the Behemoth and Leviathan, and others ,² are so characteristic that it wo uld be impo ssible for t he same mind t o have conceived this cha pter a nd the g roundw ork o f the bo ok. Wi th these indices, authorship, time, and sentiment on hand, it wil l be seen that 54:7-55:2, which ver ses ther e form an unex pected inter rupti on of t he connection, and the whole co nnected account in 65-69:25 form with 60 a separate el ement, that ha s very properly been called, The Noa chic additions or fragments. In a ddition, to m ake certaint y more certa in, the Para bles, i.e. 37-71, are expres sly quoted in 68:1 . To th ese additions undoubt edly m ust be r eckoned also 106-107, as the ¹ That it m ust be No ah, and n ot Eno ch, as the E thiopic text reads, is proved in the no tes on this chap ter. ² Cf. n otes. 27 similarity of subject-mat ter and of sty le point t o this fact.

It i s intro du ced wit h the words: “This is anoth er writing of Enoch,” as an independent tract. I t is a later, undoubtedly the last, portion of the book. The object is clear ; it is a rene wed exh orta tion t o fide lity and hop e to t hose dis appo inted o nes who might lose c onfide nce in t he prophecies of the old bo ok. We are, then, justifi ed in sep arat ing at least 54:7-55: 2; 60; 65- 69:25; 106- 108 from the ori ginal book . With equal, yes with greater, certainty c an this same thing be done with 37-71, which are not only distinguished in a marked m anner fr om the Noachi c fragments, but from 1-36 and 72-105 a lso. A mere perusal of thi s certa inly m ost bea utiful part of the whole work shows that it forms by itself a complet e whole, is introduced as a sep arate tra ct, divides itself into three Pa rables, treat s of a differ ent subject-mat ter, and this not simpl y as a c ompl ement t o the o ther p art.

Th e discuss ions o f the o ther cha racte risti cs of the groundwork and of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"the Pa rable s will be best given i n the sep arat e exam inati ons of both. The two appe llat ions o f God p eculia r to 37- 71 are “ Lord o f the sp irits ” and “ the Ancient of day s,” the latter of these, of course, be ing taken from the book of Daniel (cf. no te on 46 :1). The classi cal na me in t he Para bles, howeve r, is “ the Lor d of th e spir its” (cf. note on 37:1 sq.), and is an appellation that nicely harmonizes with the genera l spiritual and trans-munda ne character of this part, although there may be some doubt a s to th e exac t idea which the author in tended to convey in it. Ag ain, the Para bles lack at least one name of God character istic of 1-37 and 72- 105, i.e. The Holy and G reat one (cf. no te on 1:3). Certainly t his exclus ive use of different names in differ ent parts wo uld, if it wer e the only rea son, scarcely justify a separation of the book into two or mo re portions, but taken in connect ion with the o ther indice s it ha s considerable weight. A better reaso n for s uc h a separ ation we fi nd in the angelo logy and demo nology of the Parable s over agai nst the statements in this respect in the other par ts. In accordance wi th the more systematical character of the Parable s in general, t he classificati on of the ang els is a strict er one tha n in the first part . In 71:7 t hose that guard the throne of God are classified a Cherub im, Seraphim, and Ophanim; and 61:1 0, the w hole ho st of heaven are divided as Cherubim , Seraphim, Opha nim, angels o f power and of go vernmen t. A cer tain c lass, of which Mi chael, 71:3, 8, 1 3, is on e, are call ed archa ngels, and ar e prob ably t he same as t he f our angels before the thr one of God in chap. 4 0. The angel of peac e (cf. note on 40:8) i s peculiar to this part, a nd in general it wi ll be o bserved t hat it s angel olog y is of a high er, al most m ore ph iloso phical , chara cter t han in t he other portions. This i s apparent f rom the fact that the functio ns assigned them are al l of an ethi cal character (cf. notes on 39:13; 40:1 sqq., 47:4, et c.), regulated entirely by the relation t hey sustain to the de velopment of the Messianic kingdo m, and hence their co nnection with t he physical wor l d is not dwelt upon to any extent. Whether 1-37 an d 72-105 have a distin ct classification of angels is more than dou btful. Aside from chap. 2 0, which being o f doubt ful au thenti city ca nnot be used as eviden ce, the author seems only to know a class called Cherubim, 14: 11, and the numb er of a peculiar class given differen tly in 87:2; 90:2 1-31 do not admit of any conclu sion. Y et the g reate st diff erence e xists o n the subj ect of evi l spir its. The fir st par t cla ims, 15:8, that the spirits of the giants , the sons of the f allen angel s and of the wo men, are demons, w ho work vi olent destruction, and a fterwards becom e the objects of f alse worship, 99:7. A different a ccount is given in the Pa rable s. Here we meet with satans, 40:7, of w hom one, the Satan , is chie f, 53:3; 54:6. The fall of the angels consist ed in bec oming subject s of Sa tan, 54 : 6, i n whose service, 53:3, are the angels of punishment so frequently mentioned (cf. note on 53:3), w hose wo rk it is to p unish the kings and the power ful af ter th e final judgment. The ide a of placing over against the kingdom of God an oppo sing ki ngdom of Sat an, wi th a retinu e of servants such as God has in the angel s, can be traced back to the genera l plan of the author. His pole mics are directed against the kings of the earth, hence h e not only emphasizes the royalty of the Messiah as the fut ure conq ueror o f the se kings , but see s even in their future torm entor s the em issari es of a prince called Sata n. As the archangel s are the chosen instruments for the special p unishment of the fa llen beings of their own kind, on accoun t of the ter rible ness of their crimes , chap. 54, thus the kings, as spec ial si nners, shall have their special tormentors. The kingdom of Satan, alt hough opposed to God, still seems in some way dependent upon his will. The idea has a gre at sim ilar ity w ith tha t of Sa tan pr esented in the book of Job. This is but one of the m any differences exi sting between 1-36 a nd 72-105, but is sufficient to pr ove that the same ma n did not p en both, that conseq uently the Par ables are fro m a different author. How t his conclusion is strengthened and verified will be seen prese ntly in the separate examination of each part. But is the rest of t he book, i.e. 1 -37 and 72-105, from o ne hand? Here the fol lowing chap ters are probably inter pola tions: 20; 70; 75: 5; 82:9- 20, for the reaso ns assig ned in t he notes. Whether the a ccount of the world- weeks, 93 and 91 :12-17, is altog ether an interp olation, or only the a ccount of the la st three weeks, may be doubtful. That the account 91 :12-17, at least, is su ch, is manifest from the fact that it makes no mention whatever of a Messi ah, which w e have a right to ex pect i f it w ere wr itten by the a uthor o f 90:9. But as the whole accoun t is a connected one, it is b est to regard it as an addition made by some admirer of Daniel, and in imita tion o f him. The quest ion as to the authen ticit y of 105 is diff icult, as it is si mpl y"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"impo ssible to deci de what idea t he autho r desir ed to e xpress with t he “my son.” W e have no right to see it in a GTR nor to see in i t the o ne who i s GTR , the chi ef one of tho se who are the children of God, as Israel is frequently called, e.g. 2 Sam. vii. 14.

We can see no reasons for making any more separatio ns from the boo k.

In 105 not even a proba bility pro or con can be decided upon. § 4. T HE G ROUNDWORK 1-3 6 and 7 2-105. a. Object . —The author writ es out of his tim e and for his time, and hence, before learning what hi s object is, we must di scover t he chara cteris tics o f his pe riod, the grievances and wants of his peopl e, and the n what solut ions he has for the pr oblem s that were su ggest ed by the condit ion of affa irs. In the pur suit of this ef fort the pa reneti c chapt ers 94-1 05 furni sh us with the bes t material, and here again it is especially the add ress in 103:9 -15 that gives us the clearest idea. The author i s one of the faithful in Israel, one of the Chasidim, and hi s work is wri tten principa lly for t hem. He finds them a disappointe d and despondent pa rty. God’s pr omises given of old to tho se that would a dhere to his law were clear and defined. Although these did not distinct ly remove the vei l from ete rnity and off er retributio n and reward beyond the gr ave, t hey had o pened up to the just al l the glor ies and wealt h that this worl d affo rded. The retri bution taugh t by the Old Testament (at least as it was conce ived by the Jews) was a purely terrestrial one, and the degree of happiness on earth was made the index to moral worth and fidelity to God. External advant ages, fruitful harvests, vi ctory over enemies, qu iet possession of the land, lon g life, nu merous descenda nts, were what the faithful had a right to expect. For his faithfulness it “should be well with him in the land that the Lord his God had given him.” But how different was his condi tion at the time the author write s! In 103:11 the faithful co mplain, “We hoped to be the head, an d became the ta il, a nd the un right eous have made their yo ke heavy for us.” They are subjected to the will of their en emies, for ver. 12 laments that their haters had become their rulers, and they are the objects of the ra pine, i njustic e, and p ersecut ion of the sinners . The Chasidim are a perse cuted race; yes, th ey are often killed, and must des cend into Sheol in sorrow, 102:5. No ch arge is more frequently made than that of persecution and op pressi on of t he rig hteous by the unrighteous 94:6; 95:7; 96:7, 8; 97:6; 99:13, etc., and the undercurr ent of thoug ht is t his, tha t at t he time of the author the just were as a minority under the tyranny of the sinners as the dom inant p arty. It is important to notice this fact, not only because it explains why the period of the swo rd, the time of veng eance on the unrighteous, is so horribly pictur ed, but b ecause i t wil l give an imp orta nt hint as to the time when th e author wrote. In ot her respects the righteou s do not possess what had been promised, for in addi tion t o the political power al l the honor and wealth of t he ea rth b elong to the unrigh teous, so tha t they appea r as th e just, 96:4, i.e. they are i n possession of t hat which God had p romised to t he righteous. To thei r crimes of sin agai nst the fait hful is added t he great one ag ainst God, that o f revil ing him ; in fa ct “si nners” and “r eviler s” are almo st constantly spoken of in the same breath (cf. 5:4; 81:8; 91:7, 11; 94:9; 96:7; 97:6; 98:11 sq. (15); 99:1; 100:9, etc.), and they go so far as to betray the “inheritance of the fath ers,” 99:14, i.e. the God of Israel. With these da ta on hand it become s clear what t he writ er wan ted. Un der the heavy yoke o f the sup remac y and per secution of the sinn ers, and seeing the se “eat the marrow of the wheat and drink the root of th e fountain,” 96:5, they are beginning to doubt the promise s of God, to questi on the truth of God’s justice and his faithfulness in ca rrying out what had bee n prophesied by Moses and the prophets. That s uch doubt was beginning to grow in the hearts of the cruelly wrong ed band i s only too ce rtai n from 103:9-15. To wipe this"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"out, to def end the t ruth of the revealed pro mises, and to vindicate t he justice of Jehovah, that is the chief aim of the author. His object is , then, primarily an apologetical biblical one, but this only as the groundwork of the practical , exhortati ve one of admoni s hing them fait hfully and pa tiently to endure for the pr esent. His answer to the questi ons of his suff ering frien ds consists in directi ng them from the trials and tribulations of the HTR to the triumphs of the HTR , and t herefo re his a dmonit ions ce ntre i n the wo rds “ho pe” (9 6:1; 104: 2, 4) and “be lieve” (97:1), for t he day o f Je hovah would surely come. It is i naugur ated by “the p eriod of the sword,” of the destruc tion o f the si nners by the ri ghteo us; and t he vividne ss with which this period is p ictured in 99 and 100, especially 100:3, shows how impo rtant it was for the author. He is a Jew, wri tes for Jews, and his standard of retribution i s the Jewish one of “ an eye for an eye and a too th for a to oth.” The characte r of the sin shall determine the c haracter of the punishment, and t his terri ble scen e of ca rnage infli cted by the right eous on the unr ighte ous in t he day of vengeance, 95 :3; 90:19; 9 1:11, 12; 9 4:7, 9; 95:3 ; 98:12, etc., can only be regarded as the development from the su fferings of the righteous in the time of the au thor. It should be notic ed here t hat th e Para bles, w hich do n ot pr esu ppose a condition of persecution for th e faithful, say little or nothing concerning the period of the sword. But this fe ature of the author’s eschat ological hopes are like his Messianic idea, developments out of the immediate wants and longings of his time s. Here he meets an objection. The sin ners say that God does not regar d their actio ns, 104:7. The author knows better than this, for these acts a re known in heaven, 98 :6, 7, 8; 104 :7, written on the tablets of heav en (cf. note on 81:1), and are even reme mbered and related by the powers of nature, 100:1 0; 104:8. T his peculiar method of pole mics is prompt ed by the manner in which he received his revela tions as recorded chap. 12 sqq., and his intimate knowledge of the divine cou rse of nature. An object ion, however, more subtitle yet mee ts the author here that he must ref ute. The fulfilm ent of his pro phecies rests on the a ssumption that there is a retribution after death, and this t he sinners deny. They claim that death ends all, and no righti ng of the wro ngs of life can be expected aft er death. It must be es pecially noticed that the author nowhere presupposes the objection that there is no life af ter death, but onl y that there is no retributio n then. Thus, 102:6-11, the sinners do not boast that the souls di e with the bodies, but only that the fate of all is similar af ter dea th, and that t he darkne ss of Sheo l wil l recei ve both g ood an d bad. Th e same idea l ies in 10 3:5, 6. Therefore, too , in his exalt ed tone, the author emphasizes the fact, 103:1 s qq., that after death t he good will receive their rew ard, and the evil t heir punishm ent, 103: 7, sqq. T he simp le exi stence o f the so ul aft er deat h and th e resurr ectio n of th e departed are never mentio ned in a polemical spirit, but a lways as ack nowledged facts; but for the defens e of a retribution after death the auth or brings in all his power of persuasion, He s eems to appreciate the fact that he has the letter of the old co venant against him, that he must take a step beyond the Old Testam ent, and therefore, with a powerful appeal to the greatness of God 103: 1, he assures his readers of the truth of what he says. In this way, then, he has removed t he difficulties a nd cleared the way for the descrip tion o f the manner in whi ch this f uture r etribu tion s hall take p lace ; he can now proceed to what is his main intention—to a descriptio n of the worl d to come, to his peculi ar escha tolo gy. Hi stori call y, his o bject and its origin can be easily underst ood. It is a w ell-known fact that ever since the t ime when Ale xander and his successors attempted to establish G reek culture in t he East, there had been t wo parti es in Palestine also , the Helle nistic , or friends of progress, and t he Chasi dim, o r those that c lung t o the l aw and to al l Jewi sh peculi arit ies, and bore withi n their hearts a ll the hopes and promises of Israel. It is equ ally well known that this class of fait hful ones were genera lly in the mi nority and subject to the persecutio n of the oppo site party, Especially was this the case in the e ver memorable conflict between th e tyrannical and singular Antio chus (IV.) Epipha nes and t he Maccabean part y. That in this lo ng struggle be tween the conservat ive and advanced eleme nts the defeat and sufferings of the former, who knew that God had given them the promises, shou ld excite doubts in their hearts such as the au thor m eets is natural . To encourage them in their tort ured condition, to defend the promises given them, to pred ict the downfall of their enemies and the enemies of God, this was th e objec t and aim the author had in writing. It might b e called a proclamation or manifesto to the Chasidim, exhorting them to steadfastness , announcing that the long-delaye d retribution would surely and speedily com e."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"b. Contents . —As the author see ks to direct his rea ders fr om the tribulatio ns of their tim es to the glo ries of the future, his description will naturally be chiefly an esch atological one, embracing the topics of the period of the sword, the judgmen t, the punishment of the wicked, Sheol , hell, the rew ard of the ri ghteous, and the Messiah with his kingdo m. These topi cs are, in fac t, the object s of his prop hecies. During his tri p wit h the angel, Enoch, b y a hist orica l lap sus, sees Sheol already inhabited. It is the place of departed spirits both good and bad, f or the right eous desc end ther e also , 102:5. Although Sheol is but a temporary abode, to serv e till the time of the final judgment, the fate of its inhabitan ts is already foreshadowed by their condition while there. In chap . 22, which is devote d to it s descri ptio n, we l earn t hat it has fo ur apa rtmen ts: on e for t hose right eous who died at t he hands of sinners, the seco nd for the other saint s, the t hird fo r the sinners who were not punished on earth, the fourth for those whose re tribution was at least p artiall y given them befo re death.¹ The last class, ho wever, shall r emain here, and no t be subjected to a farther condemna tio n, ver. 13. This peculiar divis ion well refle cts the autho r’s ti me. Onl y one t hat ha d seen wi th his o wn eyes the num erous persecutions of the right eous could t hink of maki ng for them a specia l apa rtmen t in She ol wi th the prototype of martyrs, Abel, where they h ave the special privilege of continu ing their cry for vengeance . The inhabitants of three a part ments s hall rise agai n, the un right eous for punishment, the righteous to take part in the glori es of t he Messianic kin gdom. It should be notice d here that the author pres upposes in this conn ection th e resurrection of the wicked, a lthough in other places he ment ions o nly th e risin g of t he saint s, cf. 91: 10; 92:3; 100:5; 103:4. P recedin g the judgment of the living and dead , and also the period of the sword, the re will come the signs o f the l ast ti mes, of which we have a graphic description in chap. 80. Befo re the j udgmen t, as 90 :19 compared with sqq. shows, ther e will b e the terrible per iod of the swo rd of which we have already spo ken. Then comes t he judgm ent in w hich God himself judges, 1:9; 90:20; 91:7; 100:4. Altho ugh the judgment is stated to be u niversa l, emb racing the just al so, 1:7, it is e vident that i t is re strict ed to t hose who took activ e part in the conflict between the faithful and the unrigh teous, either a s foes or friends, and is thus not universa l in a n absol ute sense . Were i t such, i t woul d be imp ossibl e to co nceive ¹ W e sim ply give h ere an d in th e follow ing the results reac hed in the note s. 38 how the author can spe ak of an incr ease of the Messianic kingd om after the judgment through th e arrival of the hitherto neutra l heathen natio ns. The place o f judgme nt is P alest ine, or rathe r Jerusa lem, 9 0:20. The order is, first the fallen a ngels and the seventy shepherds 90:20 sqq., and then the renegades in Is rael. The condemnation of the sinners is eter nal. 5 :5, 6; 10:12; 12 :4, 5; 22:11 , sqq., and consis ts of burning, 10:14, in a pool of fi re, 10:6 ; 90:24, etc., or fiery abyss, 10 :13; 90:25 , etc., or in pri son, 10: 13, or i n a fie ry oven , 98:3, or in hell, 99:11. There are two p laces of punishme nt, one for t he fallen ang els, who are t emporaril y bound under the hil ls, 10:4 sqq., w hich is f ound “o n the end s of the earth,” 18:14 and chap. 2 1. It is the sam e pla ce that is descr ibed in 90:24, 25, where again no geograp hical local ity is assigned t o it. The pla ce of torture for the theocratic sinner s is better outl ined.

This chief characteri stic of the Messi ah, as tha t of a mili tary hero w ho wil l pro tect the just and est ablis h their rule o ver al l the n atio ns, was suggested to the author as the fi tting counterp art to the subjection of the righ teous to the supremacy of the sinn ers in hi s days.

But if Paul could q uote f rom t he Gentile poets, it is certainly har d to und ersta nd why Jude cou ld not cite a work that was evidently in high standing among the faithful. As, however, Jude quotes the book as a well- known work, its co mposi tion m ust fall quite a number of years before he wrote; but just when it was com posed can only b e deter mined b y internal evidenc e s. In chap. 90 th e author finishes h is survey of the world’s h istory, reaching his own time in 8-13, and passing o ver prophetical ly in 14 sqq. It has been shown i n the no tes tha t in al l pro babil ity th e “great horn” is not John Hyrcan us, but Jud as Maccabi, and tha t acco rding to the histor ical a ccount t here the book would be written before the death of Judas, i n other words , in the midst of the Maccab ean str uggle . It remains now t o be see n wheth er the o ther in terna l evide nce, the spirit of the boo k, best harmo nizes w ith the historical foundation furnis hed by t he event s of Juda s’s tim e or by those o f the r eign o f John H yrcanus .

The Ch asidim throughout appear as a persecuted and abase d band, while the sinners enjoy the political power and possess all the wealth and bless ings of the land. In see king to fix this to th e history of t he famous strugg le Josephus (Antiqq . xii. 5 sqq.) gi ves a fitt ing an d appr opria te answ er. It i s the time of the terrible persecutions un der the reign of Ant iochus ( IV.) Ep iphane s and th e upris ing of the fa ithful under the Mac cabees. And while the history pres upposed in the book entire ly suits this period, it does not at all that of John Hyrcanus. Here the historical facts were entirely th e reverse of what is here demanded. His reign, an eminently peaceful one, and n ot “full of war and rumor s of war,” a s 90:8-13 demands, was one characterized by the rule of t he Chasidim over the sinners. I t is a wel l-kno wn fac t that in no p eriod in the history of Isra el, fr om the exile on, the party that is represented here as the persecuted , enjoyed such absolute control and such perfect po litical a nd religious fr eedom as just in t his reign, and theref ore th e guess a t John Hyrcan us is the most u nlucky that c ould be made. Schürer (p. 117) closes his revi ew of this re ign wi th the signif icant words that since the days of David and Solomon no period had be en so glorio us and grand. We can, then, ha ve no hes itanc y in saying that a book prop hesying to the fa ithful what t hey really t hen possessed would be without meaning and purpose, while making it a product of the Maccabean s truggle, a word of encouragement to the litt le ban d of th e fait hful a midst their trial s, can alone ex plain its o rigin, object, and"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"peculiar contents. Just at what time i n this period it was writt en cannot be decided , but certainly, as chap. 90 shows, befor e the de ath of Judas, a nd aft er his f irst vi ctori es. This statement cannot be overthr own with the remark that it would bring its composition too near that of Daniel. Even accepting, wha t is by no means a n absol utely certa in resul t of i nvestig atio n, that the Book of Daniel was written during the stru ggle of the Maccabees, th is itself does not exclude the composition of Enoch during the same p eri od. T his par t of t he book now und er discu ssion do es not, as the Para bles so evidently do, sho w any pos itively certain depende nce on Daniel, not even in the account of the sev enty shepher ds.

I n some respec ts inde ed the g eneral trai n of th ought is the same, as might be expected from two authors writing about the same time and with almost the same object, but the dis crepancies and diffe rences are equally apparent.

T HE P ARABLES , 37-71 (wit h the exception of the interpol ations). a. Object . —The intimate connection betwee n the Parables and the Book of Daniel is apparent at a glance, and admits of no rational doubt. The fundamental idea of the c anonical writer, who sees in the rulers of his own times the radic ally opposites of the real ized id ea of theocr atic k ings, w ho must ther efore give wa y to the God- pleasing and predicted Messian ic king dom, i s copi ed thro ughout by his i mita tor i n the Pa rable s. The enemies this writer must oppo se and t he sins he must r eprove are en tirel y diff erent f rom t hose in the f irst p art. H ence his aim is a different one, although his ultima te object, the prediction of the speedy ar rival of t he long-pro mised kingdom, is the same as that of apocryphal writers in gener al, and of the author of the fi rst part a lso. His pole mics are no long er directed agai nst the cl ass of sinners in gene ral, but ar e part icula rly di rected agai nst the kings and the power ful, 38:4, 5; 46:4; 48:8; 53:5; 55:4; 62:1, 3, 6, 9; 63:1, 12, etc. Occasionall y, indeed, they are accused of injustice a nd actual persecut ion, 46:7; 47:4; but this st ate of affair s has by n o mea ns the prom inence that it occup ies in the first p art. This, too , will exp lain the fact that in the judg ment to come over the s inners the period of the sword i s not only not emphasized, as in the first par t, but there is even som e doubt whethe r the a uthor t eaches such a period at all. The passages that might be inter preted in this direction, 38:5; 39:2; 48:9; 46:4 sq.; 50:2, could a ll be well understood as ref erring in genera l to t he overthrow and destruction of the sin ners in the last judgmen t. The crimes of the auth or’s enemies are of a bloo d less character and centre in the g reat one of atheism; not i n a sin ag ainst the chil dren of God, w hich is the basis of the first part , but ra ther in a sin a gains t God hi mself . For they den y the Lo rd of t he spir its, 38: 2; 41:2; 45:1, 2; 46:7; 48:10 (cf. 43:4; 63: 4-8), a nd a heavenl y worl d, 45:1, a nd the Me ssiah, 4 8:10 (an d the Sp irit o f God, 67:10, and the just judgment , 60:6).

The au thor t hen dire cts his w ords a gains t the doings of the aristo cratic class a mong his people, who have deserted the God of the fathers and departed from the hope of Israel. The conne ction betwee n the au thor’ s ideas and the Old Testament idea of royalty, espec ially"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"as laid down i n the books since the da ys of David and Solomon, is apparent. The kin gs of Israel were not to be merely pol itical fig ure-heads but were, as theocratical rulers, the instr uments and deputies o f God, ruling the people in hi s name and in his spi rit. They had, then, a religious as well as a poli tical aim to foll ow, and they, consequentl y, above all others, were called upon to aid in the dev elopment of Israel to that ultimate aim, the rea lizat ion of the prom ises gi ven it i n the gl oriou s kingd om of the Messi ah.¹ In the fulfilm ent of this theocratic object, the rulers, in the author’s days, had signally failed; instead of being the leade rs of the faith and hope of Israe l, the royal ty and arist ocracy had beco me the h ome of rati onali sm and i nfidel ity. Th e perception of this fact, that there wa s “corruptio n in high places,” will exp lain the pecul iar apol ogy o f the writer, the judgment, the pre-emine ntly royal and judicial char acter of the Messi ah, and the final punishment of the sinners. His tor icall y, the status here pres upposed is easily und erstood. The Asmone ans, although originally faithful a dherents of the rel igion of Jehova h, soon after the assumption of royalty departed from the path of the Maccabean heroes . With the single exception of Alexand ra (78-69 B.C.) all the rulers from Arist obulus I. (105-104 B.C.) were wicked and god less, by no means real izing what a n e arnest Jew mi ght expect from theocr atic r ulers. This, to o, ma kes cle ar the autho r’s obj ect.

H e predi cts the downf all o f fal se roya lty a nd its un believ ing ad herents , and t he establishment of the true God-pleasing royalty through the Me ssiah as the hea d of th e congr egati on of s aints. b. The Messiah . —The contents centre in the Mess iah, as the proper theocrati c count erpar t of a false royalty, ¹ Cf. o n this subjec t, on w hich we cann ot en ter m ore m inute ly here , the artic le of D iestel, in Jahrbü cher f. D eutsch e Th eol., viii . 3, pp. 536-587. 46 and the Parables could well be called the b ook of the Messiah. The chief interest of t he book lies in hi s person and object. It has been a constant dispute among investi gators whet her the Messiah here is a Christian or a Jewish one, the latter position being generally held by old er inve stiga tors, the fo rmer b y the l ater o nes. The first glan ce may speak with s ome pr obabi lity for a Christ ian or igin, but a closer exa mination necessit ates the accept ance of a Jewi sh source. This con clusio n is al ready made p robabl e by the genera l char acter of the Messiah as the embodiment of the true theocra tic idea of t he Old Testament ro yalty, and he i s thus to be the realization of a pre-eminentl y Jew ish hope. The positi ve statements of the book mak e this probabil ity a certainty. The most impo rtant rema rk concerning the p erson of the Messiah i s found 48:3, where it is stated that before the sun and the signs and the stars were made his name had been called befor e the Lo rd of t he spiri ts; and, 48: 6, it i s said t hat he was chosen and hidden befo re the world w as created, and was hi dden, 62: 6, 7, but preserved and reveal ed to t he just, 48:7; 62:7. It is furth er stated that he “had arisen ,” 49:2; 51:5 , or “appeared,” 52:9; 38:2, and was “revea led,” 69:26. The author her e does not teach si mply a predestinatio n, but a pre -exis tence, or ra ther a pre-m undane e xiste nce, of the Messiah. For by his w ords “before the wo rld” and “be fore t he crea tion o f the sun” the author sh ows that he does not teach a pre-existen ce from eternity in an absolute and metaphysical sense, w ithout a begi nning o r orig in, but only i n the sen se in wh ich HTR is used in Hebrew, from a tim e the l imit of whi ch is fo r the w riter object ively beyond the horizon of his vi sion.¹ The writer, who manifestly does not des ire to give an exhaustive treatis e on the person of the Messiah, has a special object in emphasizing the pre-existen ce. By stating that the author of the glorious times to come is now alre ady pr epare d, and ha s been so befor e the creat ion of the world, he does not desire s imply to vindicate the certainty of the fulfilm ent of his pro phecy, but rather , by ascr ibing this sup ernat ural c haract er to t he Messiah , lays stress on t he fact that he w ill be able to judge and con demn eve n the po werful kings. That t he ability of the Messiah to carry out what is here stated of him is a thesis tha t the author m ust establish beyond all doubt, is only too manifest from 55:4 . In thus ascrib ing pre-existence to th e Messia h, the author does nothing more than is done in ot her respects by apocryphal writers in general.

The statement that the Messiah was bef ore th e sun and s tars w ere ma de find s its parallel in Prov. viii. 27, where wis dom is said to have been there “when he pr epared the heavens;” and the wo rds tha t the Me ssiah w as befo re the creation of the world fi nd their para llel in Pro v. viii . 22-26. The connection between the pre-existen t Messiah of Enoch and the pre-exist ent Wisdom of P roverbs is strengthened by the f act th at it is sta ted of him th at he ha m, 49:3, and in his days the fountains of wisdom shall flow and t he just dri nk fro m them , 48: 1; 49:1, a s well as by t he use of the wo rd HTR , unctus sum ,¹ in Prov. viii. 23, which corresponds to one of the classical appellations of this supernatural bein g, i.e. the name Messiah.² But if the occurr ence of pre-e xiste nce can c ause no surpri se when f ound in a wor k lik e the Para bles, which are based upon close exegetical study of the Old Tes tament, and if the author possib ly received some of the embellishm ents of the idea from Prov. vi ii., the idea it self he did not g et there. If it can be stat ed as a fact that the Parables in general are closely con nected with the Book of ¹Cf.

Cf. als o Mal. iii. 1; Isa. vi. 1; Berth oldt, Christol . p. 131. 49 Daniel, this can be said to be especially true concerning t he Messianic idea. What ever may be the final conviction of cri tics concerning the one “who was like a Son of man,” Dan. vii. 13 , whether, on the basis of ver. 18, 22, 27, he is to be regarded as the embod iment of the ideal Israel, or to be considered as the personal Messiah, so muc h is absolutely certain that for our autho r, as 46:1 sqq. shows beyo nd all doubt, he was t he personal Messiah . With this establ ished, the source of t he idea of pre- existence is given; it is a development from Dan. vi i. 13. The sudden a ppear ance th ere ind icate d an ex istence before that t ime, and the com ing in the clouds with the Ancie nt of days pointed to a supernatural being, and thus the a uthor’s exegesis on that passage finds expression in as cribing pre -exis tence t o the Me ssiah, a nd is a l egiti mate conclus ion fr om the premises there given. And the n our author bases his description of the Mess iah, to a great extent, on Isaiah and Micah, the two prophets who, more than others, e mphasize the personality of the Messiah and al low their descriptions to go beyond that which is te rrestrial i n both his person a nd his work.

As t o the supernatural character of the M essiah, it is, then , not only not necessary to go to the New Testament and Christianit y for an exp lanation, but it is even unlawful to do so, as the idea was developed from Dan. v ii. 13, and is jus ti f ied by an exegesis of other pass ages in the Old Testament. Altho ug h the nat ure of the Messi ah is t hus of a superna tural chara cter, a nd tra nscends t hat wh ich i s purely human, he is far from being equal to God. The author i s very p arti cular to sta te tha t he hol ds his of fice and performs his f unctions under the comm and and authorit y of God and i n his name. He has been chosen by God for this specia l wor k, and i s his dep uty; cf . 45:4; 46 :3; 48:6; 49:4; 51:3; 55:4; 61:8; 69:27; 71:17, etc., and is thus in reality a “serva nt of G od” (Is a.

In no pa ssage is divine honor bestowed on him. In 40:5 he is indeed pra ised by an angel , but as the chosen ones a re there place d in the same cat egory with the Chosen One, it is evident that no thing but the ¹ Cf.

The Messiah appear s under diffe rent na mes, so me of which a re tak en fro m the Ol d Testa ment, and the rest owe their orig in to t he speci al wo rk assi gned to him in the Pa rable s. He is call ed the Ju st or Ri ghteo us One, 38:2; 53:6; the Chosen One, the ti tle most fr equently used (cf. note on 40:5); Son of ma n, 46:2, 3, etc.; the Anointed, 48:10; 52:4; and once t he Son o f the w oman, 62:5. None of these, when co nsidered as coming from a Jewish source, oc casion any difficulty, with th e exception of the last. It is claimed that the union of th e divine and the human he re pre suppos ed coul d not ha ve been m ade by a ny one b efore the coming o f Christ into t he flesh, that consequ ently this name proves a Chris tian origin.¹ The objection would be vali d if we had a right to suppose the author u nderstood a GTR or a GTR or by this term.

That it should be so is easily un derstood from the chara cter o f the Is raeli tes, wh o knew themsel ves to be the children of God and the bearers of his prom ises. In this respect our author is a tr ue Jew; his main obje ct is the same tha t apocrypha l writers i n general have—the announ cement of th e speedy realization of he promises given of old; and th e Messiah’s importance lies in the fact that he is to be the m edium t hrough which this realiza tion shall t ake place, a nd after that s hall be the p rince and ruler of the est ablis hed new k ingdo m. And a s this e stabl ishment is in t he first place of such pri me imp orta nce, the perso n of it s medium is dwel t so largely upon.

This appearance is simultaneous with the appeara nc e of t he Messia h, and i s so intimately connected with him and his work that an account of these is also virtually a record of the fate of the former. The cong regation o f the holy is re pre sente d as al ready exist ing in heaven, like i ts head the Messiah , and both shall a ppear in the p roper time . The author assures his rea ders that both t he kingdom and its head are already rea lities, and t heir appearance is only a questi on of time. This spirituali stic view evinces a mind o f specul ative tendencies, and is a product of the continued disappointed hope of Israel, and a st rong apology for the pro mises of God. Just when this kingdom a nd king shall a ppear the aut hor nowhere definitely state s; but it is evident from the fact th at the rulers against whom he speaks shall be su rprised by their coming, that the immediat e future is the time. This is also clear from the sta tement s that the sai nts con tempo raneo us with the author shal l see them co ming. But whe n the pr ophecy is rea lized, the fi rst work of the Messiah shall be to ex ercise a just jud gment . He is GTR , judge . This fa ct has induced some, and a mong them Holtzmann, to claim a Chri stian origi n for the Messiah her e taught, as the Old Tes tament nowhere, while repeatedly attributing roya l and e ven pri estly and p ro phetic attri butes to the Messiah, ever represents him a s judge, whereas this is one of the chief offic es of Christ in the New T estament. The diffic ult y is, howev er, more seeming than real. The Mess iah is the realized ideal of a theocra tic king, and a s the royal a nd judicial pow er were united in the Old T estament, and are to this day in the Sem itic nations of the Orient, the Messiah could easily be conce ived as a judg e. The emphasis laid on this peculiar trait is explained by the fact that it was a matter of importance to the aut hor to show t hat, a bove al l thin gs, the wicke d and g odless kings, as the chief obstruction to the development of the Messianic ki ngdom, should be judg ed and condemned. Th e state of affairs in his d ays nece ssitat ed the attr ibutin g pre- eminen tly o f the o ffice of judg e to t he Messiah. The hearts of the faithful longed for a punishment of t he wicked rulers, a nd this longing finds expression in th e judicial character of the Coming One. The judgment that shall come i s to be held in a purely fo rensic spirit. It is universal, embra cing bo th rig hteous and unr ighte ous, 62:3, an d even th e dead sh all r ise fo r this p urpose , 51:1. That, however, this univ ersality is not an absolute one, bu t restricted to those who took part , eithe r as fr iends or foes, in the affairs of Israel, is not only clear from the general ch aracter of the book, whose horizon in this respect does not go bey ond the pale of Isra el on e arth, but al so fro m the f act th at af ter th e establishment of the kingdom it shall grow and increase by the addi tion of the hi therto neutral nationali ties around, 52:4 sqq.; 57:1 sqq. The same idea u nderlies 50:2 , where some of the sinne rs, on th e basis of rep entanc e, shal l be receive d. The criterion accordin g to which t he Messia h will judge i s the dee ds done i n the fl esh, fo r the de eds of all are we ighed, 41:1; 61: 8. The fi rst to be judg ed are the fa llen a ngels, 55:3, 4, and then the sinne rs. Both shall be condemned to be destroyed by fire, 4 8:9.

But this latter is encumbered with the gr eatest of dif ficult ies. Schürer has very correctly drawn attention to the fact th at a Christian would certainly not have pa ssed over the person of the his torical Christ without mentioning his death or resurrection. Drummond has fel t the full w eight of this di fficulty, and therefore invents h is curious theory of a Christian inter pola tion. He sees ve ry wel l that the whole idea a nd contents of the P arables pl ace it beyond doubt that they are a Jewish produc tion, but he is unwilling to sacrif ice his i dea of a Chri stian Messiah . But here the same diffi culties meet him ; a Christian interpolator would certainly, a s little a s a Christian aut hor, have avoid ed the r eferen ces to C hrist w hich we have a r ight, from the nat ur e of the case an d from the analogy of other interpolators, to expect. When he tries (p. 61) to excuse this by saying “that an interpolator would be careful not to depart too widely from the chara cter of the book i n which he made his insert ions,” this must be regarded as entire ly too fla t. His foundation o f sand will not bear the super structure of theo ry he has built on it. Interpolators are not so delicate conce rning their insertions, as many interpolations, e.g. the Christian ones i n the Sibylla and the Ascensio Isai ae , conclusively sh ow. The idea, too, of the kingdom is so peculiarly Jewis h that it excludes eve ry notion of a Christian source. The Messiah comes but once, and then to judge, and before that time he was h idden. B ut a Chr istia n, who knew of the histori cal Christ, coul d not ignore hi s first coming, and say that Chris t was hidden until he s hould come to judge. Even had he been a Chiliast, kno wing that Chri st had once come, a n event of p rim e impo rtance to al l Chri stians , wheth er ort hodox or het erodo x, he co uld not have passed over in sil ence the first coming. But our author, like all J ewish writers, k nows only of one coming o f the Messiah, and tha t in gl ory. Everything before that time be longs to HTR , while his comi ng shall ina ugurate the HTR , but for a Christian this latter perio d had al ready comme nced wi th the f irst co ming i nto th e flesh . Then it must no t be overlooked that t he quest ion co ncernin g the r elat ion bet ween Go d and th e Messia h, as to the nature of the latter, is treated in no place what ever in the Parabl es, while in the ea rly chu rch tha t was the question around which all inter est centred. There i s no phase of or thodoxy or het erodoxy in the early Christi an church in which w e could find a plac e for t he Messia h of th e Para bles. The conclusion, then, is that it is not only improbable but even impos sible to give a rational explanation of the Messianic ide a here developed by acc epting a Christian source, while it is perfectly inte lligible from a Jewish o rigin , and m ust be a ttrib uted to such. c. Age . —In trying to determine when t he Parables we re wri tte n we are again restricted to internal evidences alone. The only place where an his torical event could be regarde d as having been before the eyes of the writer is the prophesied inv asion of the Parthians and Med es in 56:5 sqq . It has been ar gued th at the author here had in his mind the invas ion of Parthians, 40-38 B .C., that consequ ently the book was not written until soon after that time, and that the time of composition would then fall somewhere in the reign of Herod the Great, 37-4 B. C.

The possib ility, however, that the author does r efer to this histor ical f act cannot be denied, as other th ings point to the composition of the Par ables about the time of Her od. The author ’s com plai nts of the unt heocra tic an d impi ous character of the rulers and the a ristocratic class of his day can best be explained from his period. It is a well-known fact that Herod, as an alien and not a true Jew, was a thor n in the eyes of the tr ue Israelites, while his introd uction and encourageme nt not only of Hel lenistic culture, but even of str ange g ods, and his alli ance wi th the f ree-t hinking weal thy cl ass of the Sad ducees, m ade him perfectly detestable. His government, in the eyes of all the faithful, was justly consi dered one that was the exact opposite of what it should be accordin g to the Old Testament idea of royalty, and con sequently it was endured with murmu rings that found express ion in conspiracy.¹ From such a histo rical basis, t he origin of the Pa rable s as wel l as t he pecul iar es chatol ogica l pro phecies i n them, espec iall y the cha racte r of t he Messiah , finds a suitable explanation, and it would probably not be far fr om the truth t o say that t hey were written some time during his or his immediate succe ssor’s reign.

The blessin g of Enoch is here introduced l ike the blessing o f Moses over Israel before his dea th (Deu t. xx xiii. 1). The writer pro poses a double o bject—to announce t he blessed condition of the just on the day of the final judgment, and the destruction of t he sinners. The former i s the more importa nt object; and t herefore he announces i t first, and a dds the second in a subordi nate manner. The removal of the sinners is not the ir annihilation, but, as will soon appea r, their removal from the earth to the place of punishment.—2. Cf. Num. xxiv. 3, 4, 15 . Apocryphal writers claim inspiration for their works , and thus seek to put a pia fraus on a level with the canonical books. T he character and sou rce of the vision entitles it t o the appel lation holy .

The speak ing an d conver sing w ith Go d is the author’s interpretation of Gen. v. 24.

With this cha pter t he book prop er begi ns, and i n the re cital of the fall of the angel s, with other attending circum stance s, gives t o chap.16 the historic al basis of the whole. This is based on the author’s interpretation of Gen. vi. 1 sqq., and is the s ame a s is fo und in Jo sephus Antiqq . I. 3, 1, and in Philo , De Gig . 1, 2.— Sons of heaven , being an imi tation of the appell ation sons of God applied t o angels Job I. 6; ii. 1; xxxvii i. 7; Ps. xxix. 1; lxxxix. 7 (cf. Heb. text), is common to both portio ns of this book a nd to the Para bles; cf. 13:8; 14:3; 39:1, and is expla ined by the author hi mself, 15:1-7. Lust is throughout the whole book represented as the gr eat si n of th e ange ls, 9:8; 10:11; 12: 4; 15:3; and thi s union w ith the daug h ters of men becam e a fruit ful source of specula tion for l ater Jewish wri ters. Cf. Langen, p . 321.—3. Semjaza ; cf. be low. —4. The belief that such an oat h would prove t rue seems not to ha ve been unpopular among the Hebre ws, as is testified by the implicit faith put in the bitter wate r in case a man suspected the chastity of his wife; cf. N um. v. 1 8 and Josephus, Antiqq . iii. 11, 6.—5. The number tw o hundred is repeat ed verse 8. Origen, Contra Celsum , remar ks that Celsus had heard that about sixty or sev enty angels had desc ended an d becom e wick ed. Syncel lus also gives the number as two hundred.—6. Ardis is a corrupt reading, and probably contrac ted from the GTR of Syn cellus ; the t ransl ator omit ting t he wor ds GTR ; for t he Gree k has GTR . Fam a alw ays pl aced th e fall of the angel s in the time of Jared. The book of the Jub ilees (chap. 4, ed. Dil lmann, p. 17) rem arks that Jar ed was so called beca use in his days t he ange ls desce nded ( HTR , to de scend) o n the ea rth; and Origen ( Comm. in Joan . tom . viii. p. 132, ed Hurt.) menti ons an e xpla natio n of th e word Jorda n as the desce naing , by bringing it in conn ectio n with the name Jared, and a dds: GTR ..... GTR . Epip hanius ( adv. Haer . I. 4, ed . Peta v. tom . I. p. 4) puts the origin of magic in the da ys of Jared. Hermon here taken from HTR or HTR . Hila rius ( Comm. in Ps . cxxxiii. 3) r emark s: Hermon mons est in Phoenice c ujus interpretatio anathema est: quod enim no bis anath ema nun cupatu r, id he braice Hermon dicitur. Fertur autem id, de quo etiam nes cio cujus liber extat, quod angel i concup iscente s fili as h ominum, cum de caelo des cenderunt, in h unc montem maxime convenirent excel sum. Thi s liber is undoubtedly the Bo ok of Enoch; cf. Jer ome on Ps. cxx xiii. 3. This passage proves that the original was wr itten in one of the Sem itic langua ges.—7. This verse mentio ns eighteen leade rs; the Gr. has twenty; a nd 69:2 sqq. has twenty- one; and the difference in the names in these th ree lists is considerable. Th e disharmony between 6:7 and 69 can eas ily be explained by the fact that these lists were furnished by diffe rent a uthors, for 69 is a po rtion of the Noachi c frag ments; and in so uncertain a subjec t as the names o f these angel s, which had to be drawn from imagination alone, this lack of agreement is natural and of li ttle momen t. The departure of the Ethiopic text from that of Syncellus is probably owing to a gradual corruption of the Ethiop ic. Dillma nn’s unnecessary attempt to harmonize these three lists is mor e ingen ious than successful. Cf. his Not es, p. 93 sqq. C HAP. 7. In this and the fol lowing chap ter the Greek and the Ethiopi c texts do not harmonize; the former presenting the longer, a nd in general, a lthough not a lways, the bett er, reading.—1. Sync ellus dates the even ts here recor ded as GTR , and sa ys it co ntinued GTR , which certainl y never was found in t he original book of Enoch, as this, after the manner of ap ocryp hal wr iting s, avoi ds such sp ecific limi tati ons. On t he use of roots as instru ments for magic Hoffmann (p. 116-1 20) treats extensive ly, and draws especial attention to th e in stances r ecorded by Josephus, Bel. Jud . vii. 6 , 3, and Antiqq . viii. 2, 5.—2. T he number three t housand , reduced by one MS. to thre e hundred and omitt ed in the Greek, is probably a n interpola tion. The great giants are stated by Syncell us to have been of t hree kinds, GTR —a statement that must have be en in the original, as it is presuppo sed in 86:4; 8 8:2, verses written by the same author . The book of the Jubilees (chap. 7, ed. Dillmann p. 31) divides them into Jerbâch, Naphâl, and Eljô.—4. The book of the Jubilees l. c. says that only the third class o f gia nts dest royed m ankind.—5. T hat the giant s (not men) sinned w ith the birds, etc. i s mentioned in almost the same words i n the book of t he Jubilee s . Their flesh, i.e. that of man, as, unlik e the book just quoted where t he cont est between the gia nts themselves goes on before the attack on man, the book of Enoch places this contest after the dest ructio n of ma nkind. The terr ible cr ime of drinki ng blo od fin ds its m ost vivid expression in the book of the Jubilees: “Take heed wi th blo od, ta ke much heed. Bury it in the ea rth, and"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"eat no bloo d, for it is t he soul ; never eat bl ood!” —6. Like Gen. i v. 10; cf . En. 8:4 ; 9:2. C HAP. 8, 1. Azazel; cf. Lev. xvi. 8, 10, 26; and G esenius, Thesaurus 1012-13; and Her zog-P litt , II. p. 23. That Azazel GTR (interpol ation? of Syncel lus), is mentio ned first is in ha rmony with 9 :6; 10:4; 13:1. To see what was behind them , corr ectly expl ained b y S. de Sacy: Edocuit artem specula faciendi. The Greek text and Tertullian (quot ed by Laurence, Prelim. Disc . p. xvi.) omi t this phrase. Cf. Test. Ruben , 5.—2. Cf. Book of the Jubilees , 7.—3. Amezarak is undoubtedly a co rruption of one of the names in ch ap. 6, possibly of Semjaza; cf. Dill mann a nd Syncel ius. Her e, pro bably , the Et hiopic text has omissions, and, not being abl e to render the distinction betw een GTR , the a rt of Baraq al, a nd GTR , that of Ko kabel , he translates the latter signs , i.e. of heaven, 48:3 . This verse is freely qu oted by Clemens Al ex. in Eclog. Proph. , ed. Sylburg, p. 808.—4. Cf. note o n 7:6. C HAP. 9. Surjan and Urjan are Sur iel a nd Urie l, fo ur of the highest a ngels. The canonical books (Dan.) know of Michael and Gabriel, but S uriel and especially Uriel are well known in later rabbinical theology as HTR ; cf. e.g. Talm. Bab yl . Berachoth, fol. 51ª. Generally, however, these four are Michael, Gabriel, U riel, and Raphael; cf. Bux torf, Lex. p . 27; an d Syncel lus gi ves this passag e twice with t hese last names, a nd undoubtedly correctly. These ange ls being constantly near God are the proper o nes to report the terrible fate of manki nd to hi m.—2. i s not i n the Gr . but mu st have been in the original . Emptied , i.e. o f mank ind, 67: 2; 84:5.—3. Holy ones , also a biblical name for angel s; cf. Job v. 1; xv. 15; Z ech. xiv. 5; Dan. iv. 14; viii. 13; cf. note on 15:2. Most-High or Highest God is found in the who le book.—4. A sim ilar pra yer is found 84:2 sqq., and is probably an enlargem ent of the Trisa gion. The characte r and wording of the pray e r is strictly determ i ned by the immedia te wants; cf. Schüre r in Zeitschri ft für prot. Theol. , 1876, p. 176.—6. F rom 9: 8; 10:7, and especiall y 16:3 we are al lowed to unde rstand that t hese secr ets ar e the o nes ref erred t o 8:1. Witho ut the assistance of t he fallen angels men would never hav e learned charms and conjuratio ns.—7. Here the Gr. omits the most imp ortant wo rds, made known conjurat ions .—8. H ow they defil ed themselves is stat ed 15:3 sqq.—10. They are not able , i.e. t he soul s; the p lural in the E thiop ic is de cidedl y bett er tha t the singular GTR with GTR as subject. The cries of those that died ca n be heard in heaven, 22:5 sqq. C HAP. 10. Arsjalâljûr, for which th e Gr. has Uriel, is probably, as Dillmann remarks, a combination of HTR and HTR (sun-god, lig ht-god), and i s about the same a s the name Uriel . The son of Lamech , as the Gr. state s, is Noah. The record here of an event t hat occurred aft er the death of Enoch doe s not demand that this chapter be ascribed to a new a uthor; such chronolo gical mist akes could easil y happed to o ne writing thousa nds of yea rs lat er tha n the events here mentioned.—2. Hide thyself is a comma nd to Noah, as Mo ses hides on receiving a r evelation, Ex . iii. 6; cf. En. 12:1; cha p. 81.—3. The additions t o the Gr. in this verse are probably by Syncellus hims elf.—4. Rufael, the same as Raphae l, mentioned here for the first time, is an angel intro duced by a pocry phal l itera ture, b eing f ound fi rst Tob . xii. 15. Azaz el, as the chief o f these sinful beings, receives a separa te punishment. Dudael is HTR , i.e. God’s ket tle; cf. Jude 6; 2 Pet. ii. 4; Ir enaeus, adv. Haer . iv. 30. T h e d esert as the place of his punishme nt is taken from Lev. xvi. 10 , 22. The des ert was freque ntly p icture d as the abidi ng-pl ace of demons ; cf. LXX o n Isa. x iii. 21 ; xxxi v. 13, 14; and Tob . viii. 3. This judgment is not the last, but o nly a tempo rary one, as t he next verse alr eady in dicates. This fir st judgment, although sta ted in verse 5 as one fo rever , is modified in verse 12 as seventy generat ions, and in 14:5, as for all the days o f the world . —5. As light is t he picture of happiness (1 :8, etc), darkness sig nifies misery. One of the chief horrors of Sheol is dark ness; cf . Lam. iii. 6 ; Ps. cx liii . 3; Job x. 21, 22 ; xviii. 18; and in general, Ps. cvii. 10, 14; Isa. xlii. 7.—6. Great day , i.e. the final judgment, 22:11. The punishment by fire, vs. 13; 18:11; 21:7-10, and often.—7. Heal , in the s ense of Isa. vi . 10, as could b e expe cted fr om one whose name is from HTR . The action of the angel and that of God here run tog ether as in G en. xix . 17-22; xxxi . 3, 11, 13; Ex . xiii . 21 wit h xiv. 19 . This hea ling, howeve r, can o nly ta ke pla ce by fi rst ri dding t he eart h of th e ulcero us giants.—8. All wicked deeds are recorded , 81:2, and the angels le arn them, 100:10.—9. Bastards , i.e. the giant s, the product of t he union of two different kinds o f beings, 15:3-7. The manne r of this destruction shall be self -sla ughter , as is also state d in the book o f the Jubilees (ch. 5, p. 20): “ And he sent among t hem his sword that each one shou ld kill his neighbor; and t hey comme nced to kill each ot her, ti ll th ey all fell by"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"the sword, and were destroyed from the earth. But thei r fathers loo ked on, and aft er that were bound i n the abysses of the earth till the day of the great judgme nt”; c f. En. 12 :6; 14:6; 87:1; 88:2 . From men, i.e. born of men.—10. The pet ition of the fall en ange ls is i n vain, 12:6; 13: 4 sqq.; 1 4:4, 7. Eternal life , i.e. long life, as the five hundred shows.—11. Michael , as the greatest of the angels, is t o punish Semjaza a nd the rest of the fallen, with the exception of Azazel.—12 . This punish ment consists in first seeing t he destruction of t heir children, and then being bound under the hills for se venty g enerat ions; c f. not e on ver se 4 and c hap. 91 and 93. Th e idea here expressed does no t require to be derived from the Greek fables of the Titans, but c ould very easily have been deduced by a Hebrew mi nd from passages like Job xi. 8; xxvi. 5; cf. Isa. xiii. 16. This p unishment is exceptionally heavy, as the family- ties were especia lly strong among the Jew s.—13. Abyss o f fire , 90:25, 26 .

Long life was one of the greatest blessings in the Old Testament; cf. note on 5:7, and En. 25:5, 6; 58:3, 6; 71:17, etc. Sabbath , the l ast ye ars of their lives, as the Sabbat h is the last and resting-day of the week.

In the Ascensio Isai ae , chap. vii., viii., in whi ch Isaia h ascends up to the seventh thro ugh the other six hea vens, the manner of the ascent is not stated, except that the angels cau sed it.

This stream of fire empties into the Okeanos, an idea indeed strang e to the Greeks, who, however, l ocate Hades near the Okeanos; cf.

One vo ice is e specia lly no ticea ble, a nd that is Abel ’s, according to Gen. i v. 10. As t he sins o f the p arent s are vi sited up on the c hildre n, justi ce wil l not have been done to Abel until his brother’s descendant s are destroyed.—8. We see by this verse t hat th e spir its of the dead are not all in one place , but ar e separ ated; and now foll ows th e descri ptio n of th e other apar tment s.—9. Of these (other) apartments there are three. Th e reason for this septation is probably the auth or’s conviction that the di fference in the moral character produces a diffe rent fate after death, even b efore the final judgment. The apartment here (if indee d not identical with 7 and 8) is for the souls of the other jus t, i.e. for those who were just, but unlike A be l did not die a violent and unde served death.— 10.

Although t he location w ould answer, it is more than probable that t he author did not mean Mount Sin ai of 1:4 here, for God desc ends on Mount Sin ai to judge, but here, as is shown by the context a nd expre ssed by the words, to visit the earth with goodness , cf. 77: 1.

In the Messianic times t his tree is to be transp lanted from the south, where it is now kept, to the north, to the New Jerusalem, which is to stand on the site of the old, cf. chap. 26, 27.

As the G reeks t hought Delph i, the c entre o f thei r wor ship, t he midd le of the earth, the Jewish seer her e rega rds Jerusalem as such, as i t is possibly a lready done, Ezek. xxxviii. 12; v. 5; Isa. ii. 2, and book of the Jubil ees, viii. 2, where Zion is called the navel of the earth , like the term GTR , used of the round stone in the t emple at Del phi as the cent re of t he eart h in Pin dar P. 4, 13 1; 6, 3. Early ori ental Christia ns entertained the same views, cf. Ter tulli an and Jerome on Ezek . v. 5, a nd the former Contra Marcion II. 196. In En. 90:26 Gehenna is in the m iddle of the ea rth, and in the Ethi opic Sy naxaria, de Melch isedec (Dill. Chrest . p. 16) Mount Calva ry is regarded as such. Fruitfulness is constantly a characterist ic of the Messianic times . The tree is Isra el; it was cut as a punishment for i ts sins; the branches are the faithful, who will enjoy the Messianic kingdom .—2. The follow ing is simpl e: the hill is Zion, the wa ter is the brook of Sil oah.—3. The other hill is the Mount of Olives , which is in reality but a few feet higher than Mount Zio n.

As this valley is an important eleme nt in the Messianic times the author describes it more minutely, especially as the Old Testament statem en ts on t he subject are ver y indef inite. This val ley is , according to the first par t of Enoch, the pl ace where the sinners are p unished, 90:26, 27, cf. 4 Ezr a vi. 1- 3.

Then the punis hment in Gehenna, ac cording to 90:23-27 , is restricted to the unfait hful in Israel, and the scope of the verse before us is evidently no broader, while in 54 and 56 altog ether different persons are puni shed “in the vall ey,” cf. 38, 1. The author ’s statements her e are a t least partially drawn from Old Test ament premi ses.

With this c hapter commences the mos t interesting and most important part of the whole book, the second para ble, w hich extends to chap ter 57, and gives an account of the Messia h,—his person, his judgme nt, wi th its conseque nces fo r both right eous an d unrig hteous. The fir st verse, which is manifestly intended as a superscription, has been the cause of some trouble, as it does not seem to ind icate the contents of th e para ble, a nd Drum mond, p . 63, has made us e of t his app arent discrep ancy fo r his cur ious theory o f inte rpolati on. Yet a prop er under standi ng of t he wor d concerning will pr obably clear up the matter . T h e original word is dîba , and is a preposition very frequ ently used in an adve rsative and inimical sense, like GTR , adversus, contra, in . It is so used in our own book 10:9; 56:7, and often in the Ethiopic versio n of the Bible, e.g. Ex. xvii. 3; Num. xvi. 3; Deut. x v. 9; Ps. xiv. 4; Ezek. x xxii. 9, 10; Mat t. xii . 32; xx iv. 7; A cts xx iii. 5, 30; Mark iii. 29, etc; cf. D illmann, Lexicon Aethiopico-Latin . col. 1104, and Aethiopis . Gramm . p. 313. The au thor does not so much desire to give a descript ion of the unhap py fate of the unjust, but rather in a general manner directs his polemics against those who will not believ e in a Messianic rule and judgment; it is h is defe nse of HTR against tho se who accept onl y HTR . That t his obj ect as s tated here is in str ict co nform ity w ith th e contents of the para ble is appa rent at fir st glance.—2. Cf. no tes on 38:1; 41:2.—3. Chosen One , the m ost frequent name of the Messia h in the Parabl es; cf. note on 40:5. Throne of glor y , 51:3; 62 :1-9; 69 :27-29, also throne of God , 47:3; 55:4 ; 62:1-9. In th e first part God himself is judge, but here it is t he Messia h, 51:3; 5 5:4; 69:27; but according to 47:3; 62: 2 it ma y seem a s if Go d himsel f wil l judg e. The diffi culty is sol ved in 69: 27, where we learn that although God is in rea lity the judg e he has e mpow ered th e Messiah to act i n his name; what is done by God’s deputy is virtuall y done by himself; cf. note on 10:7.

The follow ing is larg ely based on Dan. vii., and the Ancient of days becomes here the Head of days , 47:3; 48 :2; 55:1; (60:2;) 71:10, 12, 13, and i s conseq uently peculi ar to the Pa rable s. He is call ed thus as the one who wa s from the beg inning , and a s in the first para ble the eyes of t he seer are mainly directed to the completed Messia nic kingdom, a nd not to its process of development, the omission of this designation of God in that p ortion is easily understood. White , cf. Da n. vii. 9. With this An cient o f days there i s joine d, as in Dan. vii. 13, one who is l ike a son of m an (not lik e the son of man, a s the Authorized Ver sion gives it). Whatever may be the true interp retation o f Daniel’s ex pression, be it the pe rsonal ity o f the Me ssiah, o r be it the ideal Israe l, it is certa in that our a uthor, perhaps f rom Ps. cx. 1, underst ood by that di fficult cla use a certain person, and that person w as the Messiah. Son of man the Messiah is frequ ently call ed in th e Para bles; cf. 46:2, 3, 4 ; 48:2; 6 2:7, 9, 14; 63:11; 69: 26, 27; 70:1; 71 :17. His coun tenance is like an angel’s; cf. 1 Sam. xxix. 9; Tob. v. 5, 11, 1 4; Acts vi. 15; G al. i v. 14; Col. ii. 18.—2. As Da niel, vii. 16, asks for an explanation of his mysterious visio n Enoch here asks his guide; cf. note on 40:2.—3. As his chief office is that of a judge, his most important attribute is that of justice; he is i dealized justice, f or he possesses it as his own, and abides with it, based on pa ssages like Isa. i x. 6; xi. 3-5; Jer . xxiii. 5, 6; x xxiii. 15; Isa. liii . 11; Ze ch. ix. 9; Ps. xl v. 4-8; lxxii. In this capacity as just ju dge he will reveal all the treasu res of secrecy , a cla use prim aril y refer ring t o the fact that he will know a ll sec rets so as to judge aright, but manifestly he re used as referring to ev erything that his coming wil l reveal, but w hich is unknown at p resent. Chosen , cf. no te on 40 :5; he does not, then, hold his office by any right of his own , but God has chos en him, 51:3.—4. Overcomes ; none shall be superior to him, or be able to oppose him; cf. 48:5; 49:1, 2; 51:4, etc.—5. Having received such a destiny fr om God, even the mighty of this earth (against whom the author is contin ually directing his polemics) sh all be overcome. The idea of a l ast attack and defeat of the combined enemie s of the new kingdom, an idea based on statements in Ezekiel and Daniel, and promulgated by many apocryphal writ ers, an d also by the writ er of t he first part in 90:16, does no t lie in this or the fo llowing verses, nor in 52:4-9, but the se rat her pic ture t he effe ct of the Messianic jud gment on these sinne rs, and any other interpretation would not be in har mony w ith the strictly fo rensic character of this judgment as taught in the Pa rable s; cf. n ote on 41:1, an d Schürer , p. 587; cf.

Sap. vi. 2; Rom. xiii. 1. But ag ainst whom is this sin commit ted, God or t he Messiah? and who is the s ource o f this p ower? It wo uld be st range if it were t he lat ter pe rson, a nd as in verses 6, 7, and 8 this unbelief is direct ed against Go d, we are constr ained to beli eve that the him after exalt , and the he implied in whence is God and not the Messiah. Then he will e xpel , from 47:3; 62:2 , would also indicate Go d as the subject, for it seems a s if the Messiah is to ha ve the purely fo rensic part of the judgment , but the punishment is infli cted ei ther by God or throug h the ag ency of his ang els.—6.

The resurrection of the dead, first p lainly anno unced by Dan. xii. 2 , is to the autho r a universal one, t hus agr eeing w ith 2 Macc. vi i. 9, 14, 23, 36; x ii. 43, 44; Psa lt. Sa lom. iii. 1 6; xiv. 2; Josep hus, Antiqq . xviii. 1, 3; Bel. Jud . ii. 8, 14; Bar uch xxx . 1-5; l . 1-li . 6; 4 Ezra vii. 32. Th e first part of Enoch clearly teaches the resurrection of the just (cf. notes on 22:12 , 13), but also that certain s inners shall not rise, while here the writer sa ys that earth, Sheol, and hell will return their contents. T he Old Testament idea of Sheol is here split into two no tions—a pla ce of departed spiri ts and o f hell . The or igina l of t he lat ter te rm is haguel , i.e. de struction, and is co nsequently the same as the Abaddon used by the Old Testament as synony mou s with Sheol, e.g. Jo b xxvi . 6; xx viii. 2 2; Pro v. xv. 11 . But th en it i s possi ble tha t the w ord hell here has been added by the tr ansla tor, a s he ll, t he pla ce of f iery t ormen t, is, accord ing to both P art I. and the Para bles, uninhabited until after the judg ment. The pass age 61: 5 does no t co ntradict the idea of a univers al resurrection. Whether the bodies will rise with the souls is not said, b ut seems probable from the use of t he word earth . —2. Out of thi s mult itude he (i.e. the Messiah) will chose his holy ones. The wor ding is adapt ed to the forensic character of the judgment.—3. Wisdom , cf. no te on 49 :1, 3. Thi s verse i s to cha racte rize him as regent and p otentate, a role he is to assume after t he judgment is over. The just will be the recipients of this wisdom, 48:1; 49:1; 61:7, 11. Here again it i s said that he has t hese powers only as a gift of God.—4. Skip , cf. Ps. cxiv. 4, 6. The happiness w ill be lik e that of the heavenly angel s; cf. 104:4, 6.— 5. Cf.

He is for the pres ent done with the Messi anic ki ngdom as such, but still desires to give some facts concerning it that could not well have been interwoven in th e above, and with this partial change of subjects the scene of observat ion is somewhat shift ed towards the w est. He is car ried t o his de stinat ion by the wind, according to the sentiments of both authors; cf . 14:8 and 39:3. At that place , i.e. from hea ven, for there he was.—2. The metal hills belong to the secrets of heaven, i.e. it is known only in heaven that hills which now, indeed, have no exist ence shall exist in the Messianic tim es. Soft metal , or flowing metal; Dillmann has Tropfmetal , but just what is m eant is uncertai n ; bu t cf. 65 :7, 8. Ho ffma nn thoug ht of q uicksil ver, but Dillmann rightly op poses this idea.—3. In secret , I, and no one else. —4. The applicat ion of the al legory and object of the m etallic hills follows. They are for the bene fit of the Anointed; but not for the i ncrease of his power and wealth, a s 6-9 exegetical ly expla in. Anointed , 48:10.—5. Patience is enjo ined on Enoch that he may learn still mo re secrets; a promise which is fulfilled in ch ap. 53 sqq.—6 Now follows the tru e object of these mountains. They ar e symbolical of the enemies o f the Messiah, and his power will be shown by their complete disap pearance. The term mountains probably plays on the fact that the chief offen ders in th e Parables are the might y of the eart h. These mountains wil l melt; cf . Mic. I. 3; Ps. xcvii. 5, and like water that flow s, cf. Mic . I. 4, and become weak that they cannot stan d in his presenc e.—7. There fore, too, these metals will have no value to sav e in the time of the Messiah, as the judg ment then wil l be according to other standa rds; cf. Zeph. I. 18; Ezek. vi i. 19; Ps. xlix . 7-10; Jer. iv. 30; Isa. x iii. 7. Flee ; it will be impossible t o escape justice by buying the judg e.—8. No r wil l the c oarse r meta ls be o f any v alue whate ver in d efense a gains t this judgment; no human w eapon s of def ense can wa rd off the sure destruc tion. —9. In pl ain wo rds say s the author, these instruments of war will disappear when the prince of peace arrives ; cf. Hos. ii. 20; Is a. ii. 4; ix. 6; Zech. ix. 10; Ps. xl vi. 10; M ic. v. 9."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"C HAP. 53.

As in 53:5, and in nearly al l these passag es (with the possible excep tion o f 56:1), these angels are p repar ing to punish t he king s and th e powerful. Cf. 46:4. It se ems that the author, who states that the fallen ang els as special sinners had special tormentor s in the higher angel s, 54:6, c onceive d that the mighty of this earth should f ind their special tormentor s in the persons of these angel s of punishment. They are in the service of Satan (cf. note on 40:7), and may possibly be identical with the s atans, cf. Dillmann, p. 147.—6. House , cf. 38-39 and 4 6:8.—7. All things s hall be changed, is probably the meaning o f this verse. Cf. Isa . xxix . 17; xx x. 25; xl. 4. It is hi ghly p robabl e that the aut hor, o n the ba sis of Ezek. x l.-x lviii .; Isa. liv. 11 sqq.; lx.; Hag. ii. 7-9; Zech. ii. 6-17, thinks of the n ew Jerusale m to be brou ght down fro m heaven, although he nowh ere, ex cept p ossibl y in cha p. 56, definitely st ates that the Messianic kin gdom shall have its centre in Jerus alem . Cf. Sc hürer, p . 588 and En. 56:6; 61. C HAP. 54. In the third sketch h e sees th e execut ion of the judgment. This v alley with the burning fire is hell. It is not the val ley of Hinnom ; cf. notes on 27:1 sqq. and 38:1.—3. Instruments , cf. 53: 3, intended for Azazel and his host, for the for them in vs. 2 refers forward and b ackward.—5. The Messiah is also judge of the angels, 55:4; 90:24. This is t heir final p unishment, after the tempora l one described chap. 10.—6. As the expression oven of fire shows, these ve rses ref er not to the first , but to the final judgment. The same sin that occasioned the tem pora l wil l als o occa sion t he fina l puni shment, and the same a gents w ill i nflic t both; cf . 40:7.—7. With this verse com mences an interpo lation, and ends at 55:2. It is one o f the No achic f ragm ents; cf. Introd. The occas ion of its introduction was the mention mad e of the fallen angels just previous. It treats of the del uge. Th e designation of the waters abo ve as masculine and the waters bel ow as femini ne is altogether unlike the sentiments in eit her of the two main part s, but suits the gnost ically ta inted ideas of this fragmentist; cf. 60:7, 8 , 16.—10. I nterpreting they as referring to men gives t he best sense. C HAP. 55. As we have po sitive evidenc e, 68:1, t hat th e Noach ic fra gment ist ma de use of the Para bles, we can unde rstand why he he re chan ges the subject in Gen. viii. 21, and uses the term Head of days instead of God.—2 . The sig n is, of course, the rainbow.—3 . This continue s the account of 54:6, and therefore angel is here collectively used .—4. To increase the torments of the pun ishment the ki ngs must first behold the terrors of the fallen angels, as these had to se e the death of the ir ow n child ren, 10: 12. If he judges the angels and overpowers them, how muc h more easily will the kings of the earth be pu nished by him? C HAP. 56. Angels of punishme nt , cf. no te on 53 :3, from which it also app ears that tho se here punished are the kings themselves, for that their t urn is next fol lows from chap. 55.

The chosen and beloved of these angel s are then probably the mighty kings, as it would be too extravagant to suppose that all the sinners were t o be bound by special officers.—4. Will not be cou nted , because they have ended.—5 . This verse is important as it may furni sh an historical hint as to the time when the Pa rables were writ ten.

In the general indefinite character of the description here it is just as easy to u nderstand by this valley Gehinnom, even if this was east and not west o f Jerusa lem.— 5. We see we ar e stil l in t he tim e of t he deluge .—6-8. The picture drawn by the author is t his: There is a vall ey in which is medicin al water, used for the purpo se of he alth b y the po werful of the earth . But this valley shall through er uptions become a river of fire, and with that the place wher e the fallen angels wil l be punished. For a subterranean f ire in Gehenna cf. note on chap. 27. And as t he water-pl ace Dillma nn refers to Kallirrhoe mentioned by Josep hus, Antiqq . xvii. 6, 5; Bel. Jud . I. 33, 5. Th is is indeed open to the objection that Joseph us in the last passage quoted expressly states that these waters we re sweet enough fo r drinking purp oses, hence were not sul phurous as stated in vs. 6. But not only w as sulphur often f ound in Palestine, especially in the region from Jerusale m to the Dead Sea (cf. Josephus, Bel. Jud . vii. 6 ,3), but is al so in t he Old Testament a standard med ium of punishment for the wicked (cf. Deut. xxi x. 23; Job xv iii. 15 ; Ezek. xxxvi ii. 22; Ps. xi . 6); a nd that an aut hor li ke ours , so characterized by inaccuracy, should fail in his ch emist ry when the fa ilure was ea sily su ggest ed by num erous Scripture passages is not surprising. Hil genfeld and ot hers have deemed it nece ssary t o insis t on t he bath s at Baiae and the eruption of Vesuviu s, A.D. 79, as the only legitimate explanation of this passage. Hence , too, at least the pr esent co mpil atio n of th e Book o f Enoch c ould no t have t aken p lace before that da te. But even if we must do what the author permits us now here else,—go to the far west, and seek the baths of Bai ae,—it is therefore by no means necessary to think of the e ruption of Vesuvius. As Holtzma nn has already r emarked ( Jahrbücher für Deutsch e Theol. , vol. xii. p . 391), Mt. Epomeo on the island of Isch ia, much nearer Baiae than Vesuvius , suffered eruptions in the years 46 and 3 5 B.C., an d the n not again until 1301 A.D. This explanati on is also reco mmended by the fact that Enoch pict ures these phenomena a s repeated. In verse 8 the so-called Tr ichotomy is dist inctly taught .—9. Their spiri ts will change , will no l ong er re main s o pro ud, haughty, and Go d-deny ing; t heir pr ide wi ll be broken .—11. But after the ang els have been removed f or their final punishment from this place of temporal punishment, then those warm waters wil l grow col d. This makes it clear that the author imagined those s prings heated by the fire u nderneath where th e fallen angels were enduring their temporal torture. T he author evident ly doe s not t rouble himsel f abou t the f act th at the first part plai nly ta ught t hat th e tempo ral p unishme nt cons isted i n being bound und er the h ills; cf. cha p. 10.—12 . The moral of his account is that this temporal torture of the fallen a ngels in such a manne r that i ts evide nce is constantly before the eyes of the rich who are luxuriating in the bathing- places is a w arning for t hem. In making the powerful the object of his wa rning he agai n connec ts wit h the Pa rable s.—13. The stress is a lies on angels; they were healed, i.e. as Dillmann r emarks, proba bly repent; but it does no t pro duce a si mila r effe ct on the rulers and powerful.

As the Parabl es treat mai nly of the second j udgment it is probable t hat the frag mentist desires to do so t oo in t he fol lowi ng.

With t his vers e the co urse of the sun i s comm enced. Th e author’s system is briefly thi s: There are twel ve portals, six in the east, and six in the we st. The s un ascend s and des cends fr om the time of the shorte st day in the year in the first portal to the time of the longest d ay in the sixth portal, in each one of them one month; all the time the days i ncrease. Returning , he begins his course in the sixth, and returns by monthly changing his portal , and daily decreasi ng the length of the day, to t he first port al. Thus the sun ascends in one portal, and descends in the corresp onding oppo site one for two m onths every year. Ther efore, too, each porta l in the east and its correspon ding one in the west repres ent two signs of the zodiac. From the firs t to the sixth they are respectively Capricornu s, Aquarius, Pisc es, Aries, Tauru s, and Gemini; and return ing from the sixth to the f irst, respectivel y Cancer, Leo , Virgo, Libr a, Scorpio, a nd Sagittar ius. The months are nominally thirt y days; but in o rder t o at l east a ppro ach a sol ar yea r, the a uthor m akes t he thir d, sixt h, nint h, and twelfth, or the months of the vernal and a utumnal equinox es, and of the summer and wi nter so lstic es, have thirt y-one days “ on acco unt of its si gn,” vs . 13, 19; but cf. 25:31 .

Tideman, foll owing the example of Seiffert, has decl ared chapters 83-91 a production of a new Essenic writer, bu t without good reason. There is no interruption of the connec tion here, for the fact that he does not deal minutely wi th the contents of the tablets o f heaven until 92, af ter having ment ioned them in 81, has its para llels throug hout the book, w here certain subjects are m entio ned, an d then t reate d in extenso in late r chapt ers. In fact, these drea m visions-for m a necessary part of t he book. The author ha d announced the coming judgment , but had given no answ er to t he all-important when . To det ermine this is the obj ect of 83-91. And as he always associates the two judgments , the first of the deluge and th e final, it is but natural that he should mention bo th here. That the revel ation is gi ven to Eno ch t hrough a dream is no argument whatev e r for attributing these chapters to a different author, for, then, 1 3:8 would fall under the same condemnation. In fact, it was necessary to state that thes e revelations were receiv ed through dreams, and not through immediate a ssociation wi th the angels a nd a tri p t hrough the upp er reg ions, i n which m anner t he other revelations were usually rec eived, not only on accoun t of t he natu re of t he cont ents, but ma inly b ecause they were received in his y ounger days, befo re the privil ege of moving in super-terre strial wo rlds was accor ded him.

It almost seems as if the dif ferent inter prete rs vied w ith ea ch other in misund e rstanding the object and character of these sh epherds. Acce pting as self-evident that shepherds must mean men, and in this connection rulers, th e commentators have sough t high and low , i n Israel and out of Isra el, in Egypt, Chaldea, Babyl onia, Greece, and other countr ies fo r sevent y shephe rds who superintended the op pressi on of t he chosen people. Othe rs, again, have thought of seventy periods of time or periods of government, and, b ased on their respective sugges tions, have placed the origin of th e book at all times from the period of Judas Maccabi to t he revolution o f Bar-chochbas. It is impossible to mention all the vario us theor ies cir culat ing on these se venty sh epherds , for that w ould require to o much space; it is al so unnecessary to do so and to ref ute the m, for this ha s be en done to the sati sfaction of all candid seekers of truth by Gebhardt in Merx’s Archiv , II. 2, p. 163-246, w ho has m ade these seventy shepherds a sp ecial topi c of inquiry, and has conclusive ly shown the utter i mpossibilit y of accepting any of the exp lanations t hat make them leaders or rulers of heathen nations. We therefore tur n immediatel y to the only true, legitima te, and satisfactor y expl anati on. This was fi rst me ntion ed by Ho fmann (Schri ftbew eis, I. p . 42 2) , accepted and strengthened by Schüre r, p. 53 1, and l atel y adop ted by D rummo nd, p. 40 . Accor ding t o them these she pherds are not men, not rulers of heathen nations, but they are angels . There c an be no doubt w hateve r of t he truth of this interpretation, for the follo wing reasons: 1. Throughout all this symbolism men are alwa ys represented as animals, and the heathen n ations as wild beasts or birds of p rey. That Noah a nd Moses are pictured as men in 89:1, 9, 36 finds its expl anation in t he peculiar obje ct in which they are engaged. Besides , it is expressly stated that t hey became men; cf. notes. Now, in contrad istinction from men sym bolized by animals, angels are symbolized by m en, as 87:2; 90:14 clearl y d em onstrate. Angels alone are dignified as men; and what possible reason could there be for c alling the leaders of the wild beasts and of the birds men, and thus gi ving them a name even mor e d ignifi ed than the names g iven to the Israel ites? 2. Before they go out to pasture they all app ear contemporaneous ly before the Lor d, 89:59, and how could that suit succe ssive rulers? Schürer ironically asks if these rule rs were to be re garded as pre- existing? 3. In the l ast judgment t hey are associat ed with the fallen angels , 90:20 sqq. 4. The angel who keeps the record of the de eds of the shephe rds is simply called another , 89:61, thus signifying their one ness of bei ng wit h him. 5. The sheph erds ar e app ointe d, according to 89:75, to protect the sheep from the wild anim als, i.e. fro m the heathen nati ons, Interpreting the shepher ds as hea then rul ers wo uld gi ve the se nseless sentenc e that the hea then rul ers wer e to p rotec t the Israelites from themselves , i.e. f rom t hese rul ers! The author’s idea is simple and plain. During the time that Israel, by the w ill o f God, was to be oppressed and overcome by the nations a round her, he had pla ced them in the hands of seve nty shepherds , as guardians, who shou ld watch that Israel sho uld not suffer a nd endure more than was God’s will. This the sh epherds neglect to do, and deliver to the wild beasts and birds of prey more than t hey shoul d have done; hence these shepherds shal l be punished, and be cast with the fal len angel s, who ha d also prove d fait hless, i nto th e fier y abyss . The ide a tha t Israel s uffered more tha n her sins deserved is not stran ge or unexpe cted. It is the author’s exeg esis of passag es like Isa. xl . 2 b (acco rding to the"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"true interpretation of the Targumim, Luth er, Authorized Vers ion, Delitzsch, and oth ers), Isa. lxi. 7 and Jer. xvi. 18, where it is stated th at Israel has receive d doubl e for a ll her sins.

Alth ough a ll th ese shep herds appear contemporaneously befor e the Lo rd when they re ceive t he commission, t hey shall not p asture toge ther, b ut one after the other.

An au thor w ho but o nce (14:24 permits even the sacred person of Enoch to go into the presence of Go d , could under no circum stances have imag ined heathen rulers, the opp ressors of God’ s children, as standi ng before him, and receiving their o rders from his own mouth. —60. According to numb er , i.e. a certa in numbe r. These shepher ds were not t o act independently, but, like the ang els in the Old Testam ent and in Enoch, were simpl y execut ors of God’s will and com mand. These are functions that a Jew, writ ing no t in th e time of the return from the Exi le whe n the hea then Cyr us had appe ared a s the instrument in Go d’s hand for the benef it of his peo ple, but in a tim e when e xperi ence had exhibited the surrou nding heath en nati ons a s the most bitt er haters and revi lers of Israel ’s God and persecutors and tormento rs of the peop le, in the tim e when th e cruel s cenes in augura ted by A ntioch us Epiphanes were st ill v ivid bef ore th e author—these are fun ctions, we say, that a Jew at that time could never have ascribed to Gentile ru lers.—61. God calls anothe r shepherd, i.e. angel, to keep record of the deeds of these seventy sheph erds. The “ot her on e” is cl early and evi dently an ang el, as is seen f rom 90: 22 and 14, proba bly the archangel Michael, the pat ron angel o f Israel; cf. D an. x. 4 sqq.—62.

Give them ove r , i.e. to punishment .—64. These shepherds knowing God’s will that only a certain number shou ld be destroyed are not to be disturbed or advised in their labor. Bu t how could we suppose that, e.g. Antio chus Epip hanes sho uld hav e a kno wledg e of t he fact that he was to be an instrument to punish Israel, and should also be able to determin e how far the divine will would allow him to go? For this kno wledge, presupposed here as the basis of the just ju dgment of God over t he shephe rds for the transgression of Go d’s la w, is cl early in pos session of the se shepher ds, according to vs. 59 and 60.—65. Sh ows that the killing of the sheep co nsisted in giv ing th em over into t he hands of the wild beasts, as al so tha t the shepher ds were beings entir ely di fferen t fro m the lions. Did the r idiculous incongrui ty of call ing princes and leaders of wild beasts “shepherds” nev er st rike the advocat es of the heathen p otentate theo ry? As the lions are in all probability the Assyrians, the auth or evidently places the be ginning of the rei gn of t he shephe rds in the time of the struggle of the northern kingdom with Assyria.—66 . The fall of th e two king doms is summed up in the a ttack of the lions and the tiger s, the l atter being t he Chal deans. T he wil d boar s are t he Edomites (cf. vs. 12), who also took part in the destruction of Jeru salem; cf.

Cf. also Jer. xii. 9; Ezek. xxxiv. 5 , 8; Isa. lvi. 9.—71. Wi th the s ealin g of t he book the first scene is closed.

Embraces the whole period of the capti vity, w hich is s tated in rou nd numbe rs to h ave been twelve hours. T hat these twelve hours are to designate the time of the captivity alone is as clear as dayli ght from th e after that , i.e. after the events to the destruction of Jerus alem, just mentioned, had transp ired, then a certain numbe r of shepher ds past ured till the time when three she ep returned. How Dillmann can say that these hours embrace th e time from Jojaqim to Cyrus is incomprehensi ble. Cyrus is certainly the terminus ad q uem , but that Jojaq im is not the terminus a quo is equally cer tain. Three retur ned; Dillmann thinks this a corruption for two , i.e. Zerubable and Jos hua. If the w ord three is a cha nge ma de by the Ethiopic tra nslator, he pr o bably means by t his thi rd one n ot Nehe miah o r Ezra, but Jer emiah . The Ethiopic church has in many of her biblical co dices a unique Book of Baruch , that claims inspiration and was"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"exten sivel y used in Ethiopia; in which book it is expressly st ated that Jerem iah returned to Jerusalem, and a record is made o f his labors a nd death there.

The reas on why this second temple was unclean was because even after the captivity the Israelites w ere still blinde d, i.e. had not return ed to G od.

T he seer sum s up his v ision i n the words that so far thirty-five sheph erds, includin g those that had ruled t welve hours, 8 9:72, had governed. Like the first; as those governi ng twelve hours co mpleted their times , thus di d also the rest of the thirty-five.—2. Introduces a new per iod and new enemi es. They are pictured as birds of pr ey to show tha t they are dist inct from the previously ment ioned enemies , from an altogether different sto ck or famil y. It is the peri od of the invasi on of the Greek s and their allies. The eagles leading the rest are natur ally the Greeks, or, mo re specifical ly, the Macedonia ns. The crows , accor ding t o vs. 8, 9, and 12, a re the S yrian s. Who t he vultures and buzzards are does not a ppear; mo st probably these are general terms to designate the other nations allied with t he Greeks, so that the au thor did not intend to designate any particular nations wit h these names. Pick out the eyes and devour their flesh , because they were birds . The statements of the auth or are so broad that it is impossible to fix them to any particular historical events, except in gene ral t hat th e fate of the peopl e under A lexa nder the Great and hi s suc cessors are port rayed. —4. Who the dogs are cannot be determ ined; but cf. Tidema n, p. 281. Above, 89:46, 47, they were the Philistines, w ho cannot, even wi th Sir. l. 26 on ha nd, be meant here. He m entions the dogs, a domestic animal, hence belonging to a class of ene mies of th e peri od pre ce ding t he Grec ian, si nce the p eriod of the birds of prey and t he eagles designate the enemies of the period just und er cons idera tion, to sho w that at the end of t he Greek perio d Israel had to suffer from bo th their form er and their present enemies , an idea well suiting the str uggle s betwe en the various successors of A lexander the G reat in the East and in the West; cf. M ic. iii. 2 , 3.—5. Thi s Greek perio d was su perint ended by twent y-thr ee sheph erds, a nd thus a ll fr om the beginning, the thirty-f ive of vs. 1 and the twent y-thr ee here, had com plet ed fif ty-ei ght ti mes. Her e we see the necessity of correcting the thirty -six or thirty- seven of vs. 1 into thi rty-five. Thus, then, e ach shepherd completes one time, and i n 89:72, then, there m ust have been tw elve she pherds for the twelve hours. With this another period closes. It is interesting to see what mart yrdom histor y must s uffer t o furni sh the advocates of the heathen rulers t heory with king s enough to sati sfy the demands of this verse.— 6. The last period of heathen rule. This epoch is marked by the birth of small lam bs, or, more l itera lly, small male lamb s, who began to open their eyes, i.e. began to return to the God of Israel. He designa tes by this name t hose in Israel who, about this time, especially in the day s of An tiochu s Epip hanes, w hen the l eaders of the peopl e and t he sheep themselves began t o adopt Gr eek ideas and manners (cf. 1 Macc. I. 11-15), took a f irm posit ion fo r the religion and law of their fathers. In short, they are the well -known HTR , 1 Macc. vii. 13; 2 Macc. x iv. 6, the pious. They ar e call ed small on acc ount o f thei r smal l numbe r, and lambs because they were th e generation of the future, destin ed to grow and increase. They crie d to the sheep . i.e. t o the r enegad e Israe lites ; warned them, and appeal ed to them for help.—7. But this cry was in vain, the Greek party would not d epart from its erring ways o r assis t the fa ithful .—8. The crows , i.e. the Syrians, attack these l ambs and kill one. Who this one is will be seen in verse 9. But they al one are not t he sufferers, the sheep t oo, the other unf ait hfu l"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Israel ites, are “broken.” In this vers e he pictures the b eginning of the struggle of the faithful under M attathias and his sons .—9. The pre ceding has bro ught us to the beginning of the strugg le between the Chasi dim and the Greek part y. Nat urall y we sho uld the n expect that the great h orn would be no one else but the great Judas Maccabi. To this, ho wever, Ewald, Dillm ann, and nearly all other investigato rs object, and fi nd this horn in John Hyr canus. The onl y reason for doing so is acknowledged to be the fact that the time from Antio chus Epipha nes, wi th whom this l ast period commences, to Judas is too sh ort a perio d for e ither t welve foreign, heathen kings, or for the rule o f twelve ang el shepherds (Schürer). This objection is, however, not valid , for it should be espec ially noted—what has been so far overlooked entirely— that the writer does not consider the period of the last twelv e shephe rds clos ed with t he comi ng of t he grea t horn, but onl y by the inauguration of the Messianic ki ngdom. The great horn, and with i t the w riter , is in t he middle and midst of this last epoch, t he rule of the l ast shepher ds. Just how many of the se had g overne d befor e the ri se of t he horn, and how ma ny were to ar ise yet until the new kingdo m was e stabl ished, is nowhere stat ed. The horn itself is historical ly not the terminus ad q uem for this rule, but only an import ant factor in the events of this rule. We are, then, not even allowe d to seek twelve periods from Antiochus Epiphanes to the gr eat ho rn, but must place the hor n rather early in thi s last perio d, as great st ruggles are still expected before the un godly rule of the shepherds will end. The period will be short, for only twel ve shall rule, and the character of this period is reflected in the words “that these last shepherds ha d slain more than the rest,” and thu s certainly points to the eventful days of Ju das Maccabi, and not to the c omparatively peaceful days of John Hyrcanus. Then the specific number twelve further than indi cating a short period, should have littl e weight in det ermining who the gr eat ho rn was , as thi s twelve is sim ply t he comp letio n of th e autho r’s ar bitrary and unhistorical system of the rule o f the shepher ds in Isr ael, e nigma tical ly divi ding t hem int o four perio ds of 12+23_ 23+12 shepher ds. Other r easons , too , poin t to Ju das, an d not t o John Hyrcan us. 1. It is impossible that an author like ours, reciting the w eal a nd woe of the f aithful, should have passed over in si lence, or in insig nificant words, the even ts of t he Macca bean pe riod, which w as so important just for him, the establis hment of relig ious and political freedom , puri fica tion o f the t emple , the p ower o f the Ch asidim in the d ays of John Hyrcan us. 2.

This appea rs here as a stru ggle for the very exist ence o f that hor n, and he nce cann ot fi nd an ex plana tion i n the ra ther in signif icant two w ars of John Hyrcan us agai nst the Antio chus Side tes and Antio chus Cyzicen us, espe ciall y as the latt er was an ag gressi ve measure of Joh n Hyrcanus in which he was not even present,—s omething that is demanded b y the context. The words can be p roper ly unde rstoo d and a pprec iated only b y referring them to the ever-memorable events in the ti mes of Judas Ma ccabi, and reg arding them a s a ref lex o f those bloo dy, but glor ious days. Dillmann himself admits that in this manner vs. 13 could aptly find its expl anation in 1 Ma cc. iii. 7; vi. 53; v.; t hen 2 Macc. vi. 8 sqq., 13, 14; 1 Macc. vii. 41, 42; and in 2 Mac c. xv. 8 sqq. In this struggl e against so many foes Judas is represent ed as bei ng assi sted by the ma n, i.e. angel , who w rote t he name s of th e unfai thful shepherds.—15. In the midst of this contest the Lord hi mself comes to take part in the struggl e. With this the author goes from an hist orica l basi s into a pro phetic vision of the future , and w hat fo llow s canno t be regarded as historical, but only as showing how the writer thought, from the present stat e of affai rs, the future would shape itself. We see, then, the au thor stands in the mids t of the Maccabean struggle. th e horn Judas has already conq uered in battle; his enemies are preparing to cru sh him. So far the author’s knowl edge g oes. Of the death of Judas he knows nothing. The expe cted assistance from God h imself, to gether with what foll ows, is the prophet ic picture he draw s of th e futur e fate of thi s grea t horn. —16.

But before proceeding to his admonition s the author gives a brief survey of the develop ment of the world’s hi story in ten w orld-weeks, e ach consisting of seven part s. We ha ve then a gain t he myst erious number seventy. Of these ten we eks seven belong to history, and thr ee to the future. Out of the books; Enoch, the scribe, writes down his revelations, and reads th em to his children; proba bly the books w ritten during hi s tour by himself or the angel; cf . 33:3, 4; 74:2; 81:1 sqq. (Para bles 40:8).—2. The sources of his know ledge, as written in these books, were visions, angels, and tablets of heaven, 81:1; cf. 103:2 (106:19; 107:1; 108:7). Plant , cf. 10:16.—3. The first week goes from t he creation to Enoch’s time. Seventh , not l ike Jude 14, but with Dillmann and Ewald, in t he seventh part of the first week , counting seven generations for this week. Retarded , i.e. the period closed before th e deluge.—4. Th e second week goe s to the deluge and the cov enant with Noah, Gen. viii. 21-ix. 17. —5. The third wee k ends with the call to Abraham. Plant of the judgment of justice , i.e. the pe ople among whom G od wil l hol d his judg ment.— 6. The fo urth we ek ends w ith t he givi ng of t he law on Mount Sinai. Visions , et c., i.e . revelations will be made to the holy and ju st, referring GTR to the"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"revelation of the Torah. Court , scarcely Pal estine, 89:2, because the gi ving of the law wa s already in the end thereof , but rather a cen tral plac e of w orship , the t aberna cle, 89: 34, 35.—7. The fif th week ends wi th the building of Solomon’s t emple. Supremacy , referring t o the templ e; cf. next verse; i.e. of reli gious supremacy, as the temple i s the house of the Gr eat King, 91:13. To eterni ty , for in the Messi anic t imes i t shal l be rebuil t.—8. The sixt h week e nds with t he burni ng of t he temp le and the Cap tivit y. It i s the pe riod o f reli gious degeneration, 89:51 sqq. A man shall ascend , i.e. Elijah; cf. 89:5 2. Forgetting true wisdom is synon ymous with departure from God.—9 . The seve nth is t he week in whi ch the author lived, a nd hence he characterizes i t more minutely; it is a rebelli ous age, i.e. rebel lious not po liticall y, but against Go d and his laws; cf . 89:73-75. —10. As according to the whole spirit and letter of the book the con ditio n of th e just sha ll no t be ameliora ted until after the judgment and the condemnatio n of the sinners, the r eward here spoke n of, and the seven portions of learning mus t refer to something given them d uring t he Me ssianic reign. It is in all probability the much-lauded wi sdom that is t o form one of the blessings o f this reign, e.g . 91:10; 92:1, and often. To see in vs. 11 -14 an epexegesis of this verse, so that the seve nfold lear ning co nsists i n the instruction on the physical world (Dillmann), or that this learni ng should refer to the book of Enoc h itself, is certainly a mistake. Even if our author is not overburdened with modesty, he would scarc ely dare to put a sevenfold higher estim ate o n his ins tructi ons tha n on the bibli cal. B esides, the author has been treating the history of his people solely and alone from a purely religious stand-point , and now to sum up a ll wisdom and warning in the strange, and by no means genial statements of the next verse s is not only an improbability, but an impossibili ty. If thes e word s are f rom t he autho r of t he prev ious pa rts, they certainly do not belon g here; but it is mo re probable t hat they are t he product of som e imaginat ive interpol ator. The att empts made t o determine from the know n leng ths of the fi rst six weeks t he unkno wn len gth of the seve nth, ei ther by counting the yea rs, or by reckoning, af ter the biblica l manner, by g enerations have a ll proved m ere guesswork, and have only the me rit of inge nious and interesti ng hyp othese s.—11. Voice of the Holy One , i.e. thunder; cf. Job xxxvi i. 4, 5; Ps. xx ix.; x lvi. 7; lxxvii. 17, 18. Th e incomprehensibi lity of God’s thoughts, Job xx xviii. 33; Ps. xl. 5; xci i. 5, 6.—12. Cf.

The eighth week, the first one of the Messianic perio d, is that of justi ce, the time of the sword, 90:19 (cf. vs. 34); 91: 11. Into the hands of the just , 38:5; 92:4; 95:7; 96:1; 98:12. The end of this period wil l be marked by th e rebuilding of Jerusalem a nd of the templ e; cf. in gene ral Ex . I. 21; 2 Sam. vi i. 11; Is a. lx . 21, 22; lxv. 2 0-23. Great King , 84:5.—14 . The ninth week is the week of the judgment, however not of the final o ne. Dillma nn expla ins it from 50:2-5; 90:3 0, 33, 35, as referring to the time when the true religion will proceed from Jerusalem to the so far neutra l heat hen nat ions t o tea ch them to ack nowle dge the true G od, and this certainly best harmonizes wit h the last cla use. Will de part , 10:16, 20, 21; 92:5; cf. Ps. cii. 26, sq.; Isa. lxv. 17; lx vi. 22.—15. The tenth week ends with the final judgment . Watchmen , of co urse the fall en ange ls. Even with this differ ence that the judgment over thes e watchmen is elsewhere placed in th e begi nning of the Messia nic times , 90:21 sqq ., 10:12; and 16:1 , the l engthy expos ition of the future times occasi ons a do ubt as t o the authenticity of these verses.
