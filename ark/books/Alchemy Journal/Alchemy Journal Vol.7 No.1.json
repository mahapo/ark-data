Both spagyrics and homeopathics are valuable healing tools, and they can work together to heal effectively and gently, as many of our clients can attest. But their differences far outnumber their similarities, and it has been something of a crusade of ours to explain these differences and clarify this issue in the minds of the public and healers, especially as spagyrics become better - known. First, we shoul d examine some of the history of both systems. Spagyric, as a word and process, was invented by Paracelsus, the great 16th century physician. As many of you know, it means separate and recombine, and can be used to make herbal extracts of great power and e nergetic force. After studying Paracelsus, Samuel Hahnemann applied a small slice of Paracelsus' work to create a new system, homeopathy. Homeopathy is an effective holistic healing system, but it was not part of Paracelsus' work, being invented more than 200 years later. Homeopathy has gotten laid over Paracelsus' work for so long and by so many that many people equate the two; an unfortunate misunderstanding that overlooks the fine points of both systems. When you realize that these systems were invented by two different people centuries apart, it becomes more apparent that they are different modalities, and that even if one was inspired by the other, calling them the same is incorrect. But, besides these historical differences, there are great differences in the systems themselves. Homeopathic remedies are created by extracting a substance in a menstruum, usually alcohol, then using successive dilutions and succussions of this \"mother tincture\" to create a remedy which is charged with a static or frozen vi brational signature of the original material used, but with none of its physical characteristics. It is true that Paracelsus used some methods of dilution to render some of his medicines safely potable or more gentle, but the total annihilation of the subs tance's physical being is from Hahnemann's work. Paracelsus repeatedly stressed the importance of working with all three levels of the plant's being - the obvious physical of the Salt, the life force and intelligence of the Mercury, and the eternal core of the Sulfur. All of these levels are accessed, purified, and incorporated into the final spagyric through processes of concentration, and the final result in a properly made spagyric will be a very concentrated extract with the deep color, intense flavor, and low dosage typical of our products. The difference between our spagyrics and any homeopathics, then, is even apparent to the ordinary senses.

The four key steps of Spagyrics are: separation, purification, incineration and re - unification. After studying Paracelsus,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"To treat at the cause of the disease, not just the symptom, requires that all three levels be present in the spagyric to operate on the patient, who also has these three levels of being. Stripping away all but a reflection of the Mercury level of a substance (the homeopathic process), therefore, is not Paracelsian, and by definition, not spagyric. We should also note here that we are the only company to truly implement the Paracelsian philosophy in this regard, and uniquely offer three different levels of Spagyric medicines. That the original substance is changed so much as to be no longer its original self can be easily seen by looking at such homeopathic remedies as Hydrophobinum, Anthracinum, Belladonna, or Arsenicum Metallicum. If one ingested rabid dog's saliva, anthrax, deadly nightshade, or arsenic in their natural state, illness or death would result; as ho meopathics, these substances are used to great healing effect. The crux of homeopathy is this taking of a deleterious substance and, in effect, flipping or reversing it into a healing remedy. The homeopathic processing overrides the original substance - it is no longer anthrax, etc., but a homeopathic remedy. The same mechanism occurs with spagyrics treated homeopathically - the end results are homeopathics, and no longer spagyrics. This \"flipping\" was strongly demonstrated to us by a healer we work with who had been treating several patients with our spagyrics, and seeing great improvements in their illnesses. After running out of stock of our spagyrics, she obtained homeopathic preparations which another company had made from our spagyrics (unauthorized and against our advice), thinking they would be the same. This healer quickly discovered that, not only did they not heal as well, they actually made the patients' ailments worse in most cases! She called us in a panic, not knowing what to do, but after only a few treatments with new stock of our true spagyrics, her patients were again back on their course of improvement and healing. This case shows how, just as something harmful can be reversed into a medicine, so, too, can the opposite occur, creating a rea ction much like a homeopathic proving. That event, and other experiments we have done, are why we never recommend dilution of our spagyrics in any way. Spagyrics are made following a continuum of process and energy, and that continuum should be kept intact in their use. But they do work very effectively when used in conjunction with homeopathics, and many of our clients work this way. Homeopathics do a great job of smoothing out layers of symptom and imbalance, to allow the patient to become more clear, rec eptive, and open to the deeper long - term work that spagyrics can then be brought in for. We hope that this has been enlightening for you. We encounter this misunderstanding frequently, and are dedicated to ensuring that the alchemical healing lineage we fo llow is presented truthfully and completely. This misperception occurs more and more often as large European pharmaceutical companies realize the profitability of taking labour - intensive spagyric mother solutions and stretching them into sometimes thousand s of gallons of sellable homeopathic product. We are perhaps old - school purists in this regard, but profitability is not the motive for our work -- the facilitation of physical and spiritual healing is.

Since then, we have provided discriminating clients with a complete Alchemical and Spagyric apothecary, including not only products, but a practical system for their u se. Our system, based on our research into alchemical texts from many centuries, has led us to a truly holistic understanding of health and wellness, an understanding which we have applied to create a line of products to promote health and longevity at all levels of being. In ancient times, alchemists were often called Philosophers of Nature because their method of work consisted of observing natures operations and then applying them in the laboratory. This crucial link, between the rhythms and processes of nature and the healing work of mankind, has been largely forgotten by most of today’s physicians. In our work we seek to revive this ancient spiritual chemistry for healing and wisdom in the modern world. Website: www .al - kemi.com . Email: alkemi@al - kemi.com Return to Top Electrohomoeopathy: A Revolution in Medical Science B y Dr. Ajit Singh Inventor and Invention  The medical system of Electrohomoeopathy is an art of healing through herbs only. The inventor, Grafen Ceasre Mattei (Count Ceasre Mattei,1809 - 1896), who was an Italian to whom the title of Count was Bestowed by Pope Pius IX, was very impressed with the he aling effects of Spagyrism and Homoeopathy. So, Mattei started to treat patients by making medicine with a unique process of cohobation and ultimately discovered a new theory and concept of health and disease after the 30 year of experiments. It is stated in the form of the principle that: “Life is in Blood and Lymph and disease in its Vitiations, and the medicine is placed between two classes of phenomenon: disease and the normal state of the organism.” The result of its intervention is, at first, to lesse n then gradually destroy and finally expel the “evil.” So, in this way Mattei declared his new invention in 1865. Why the Name Electrohomoeopathy? Is it Different from Homoeopathy? Due to the rapid effects of the medicines, Mattei gave it the name Elec trohomoeopathy. In Mattei’s own words he stated that “These electric phenomenon strike me as very remarkable, and from them I have given the name of Electrohomoeopathy to the medicine which Providence has made known to me. By this word, I desire to express the fact that these remedies are a class of Electroids conforming to the law of similars and that they posses a power and promptness which allows them to be compared to electricity.” Mattei further stated that from this new phenomenon and especially from the changes in the organism that follow a state of health is created. He also said; “I contend that my discovery supplies what was wanting in the Materia Medica of Hahnemann.” This is only one reason to use the word homoeopathy in Electrohomoeopathy. Othe r specific differences between Homoeopathy and Electrohomoeopathy are as follows: 1) Hahnemann (inventor of homoeopathy), tried the effects of his remedies on the healthy man and afterwards, from his observations of their effects, he founded what homoeop aths call the “pathological genesis of homoeopathic medicines” which made known the sphere of their action on invalids. 2) According to Mattei (inventor of Electrohomoeopathy), there is only one straight way to arrive at the knowledge of medicinal power and that is to try remedies on the sick man and to note the class of diseases they are fit to cure. placed between two classes of phenomenon: disease and the normal state of the organism.  ARTICLES Spagyrical Homeopathy Electro - Homeopathy Alchemical Transmutation FEATURES New Releases From the Fire Announcements Lectures EDITORIAL From the Editor Submissions Subscriptions"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"3) Mattei, like Hahnemann, did not recommend subdivisions of remedies, that is dynamisation, to produce the real effects by almost infinitesimal doses . Law of Dosology Mattei said that the: “Dose should be given in an inverse ratio to the gravity of the disease.” As per Electrohomoeopathy philosophy that a cure is simply the result of organico - vital reactions caused by agents which we call remedies , and that such reactions are lessened in proportions as less vitality remains in the centre of the organism and to the inveteracy of the disease, it will be seen why it is necessary to diminish the quantity of medicine in ratio to the intensity of the mal a d y . To do otherwise would be contradicted to the general law of nature, namely that: “Reaction is always equal and opposite to action.” Electrohomoeopathy Pharmacy Electrohomoeopathy medicines are known as the Spagyric essences, which are prepared fr om 114 medicinal herbs by a very delicate process of cohobation. In alchemy, cohobation is the reassembling of the purified elements obtained by means of spagyrism. It is not concerned with the act of passing a solvent again and again over a substance to o pen it and to dissolve it as per the definition given by Glaser. A spagyric essence is clearly colorless to yellowish and smells very intensively aromatically. Pharmacodynamics of Electrohomoeopathy Spagyric Essences The active ingredients in Electrohomeopathic medicines are the mineral salts which function by stimulating neuro immuno endocrine system. The ways that this stimulation is brought about are: (i) By direct activation of certain pathways. (ii) By correcting malfunction in absorption , transportation and excretion. (iii) By redistributing mineral salts, trace elements, etc., which due to stress, disease or medication, have become locked up in the wrong place. For instance, infection and cortisone treatment induce the transport of zinc and iron to the liver and the release of copper to the bloodstream. In edema, sodium in excess quantity enters the cells. Electrohomeopathic medicines restore cell membrane integrity and restore proper absorption, transportation and excretion, which are es sential in accordance with “transformation of matter” as per physiology. (iv) By compensating for a deficiency induced inactive pathway, it means redistributing any scarce element to the tissues at potential risk or activating some alternative pathway. Fo r instance, vitamin E and selenium have a number of overlapping roles. If vitamin E synthesis is stimulated, selenium deficiency would be less critical. Safety of Electrohomoeopathy Spagyric Medicines: Spagyric medicines are produced in such a way that no alkaloids or toxic molecules can be found in the final products. Though pure and undiluted, their efficacy may be compared with the “highly diluted” homoeopathic remedies. They have no known side effects. The advantage of these spagyric essences is tha t they contain organic and inorganic materials, small alcohol content and, used in the recommend dosage, are very compatible with normal conditions. The active substances of the essence can be proven with modern analytic technology, both in quality and qua ntity. These plant life concentrates contain a unique ability to: 1) Alkalise the PH, neutralizing acidity 2) Remove many toxins and toxic molecules from the body 3) Cleanse and purify the liver within 28 days 4) Oxygenate the cells, allowing more oxygen into the cell and brain 5) Destroy harmful free radicals 6) Rid the body of harmful bacteria 7) Purify and regulate the blood, effecting blood circulation and sugar levels 8) Build the immune system 9) Relieve pain caused by acidosis and inflammatory proc esses Electrohomoeopathy is very different from the system of “the similar and the pathogeny” of Hahneman. It is true that Hanneman’s system is attractive on intellectual grounds, but it is very easy to get lost in it, even for a confirmed homeopath. The b ig dilemma, and the center of homoeopath discussions, is to know if a high dilution rather than a low dilution is to be used.

The spagyric experience demonstrates this easily. Classification of Electrohomoeopathy Medicines. Mattei gave eight specific groups of medicine in addition to five “electricities”, also known as the electric fluids, which are mostly used in making a compress for the body points. Mattei classified the medicines in groups as follows: Name of Medicine  Action 1. Antiscrofoloso Group For purification of the lymph 2. Antiangitico Group  For purification of the blood 3. Antilymphatico Group For lymph metabolism disorders 4. Pettorale Group  For respiratory probl ems 5. Vermifugo Group  For all kinds of infective germs and worms 6. Antivenereo Group  For constitutional disorders, venereal disease 7. Febrifugo Group  For all kinds of fevers and as nerve remedy 8. Anticanceroso Group For all kinds of cancers, benign and malignant 9. Five Electric Fluids a) Red Electricity Stimulant b) W hite Electricity Sedative c) Blue Electricity Antihaemorrhagic d) Green Electricity Pain killer e) Yellow Electricity Intestinal remedy In addition to these medicines, there are 36 Electrohomeopathy injections that were prepared by Theodore Krauss, one of the great followers of Mattei. He further manipulated true Electrohomoeopathy and created Electro - Complex Homoeopathy in Germany. Production of this medicine was begun by the ISO - Arzneimittel Company under the name of Ho moeopathy Medicines and the formulation was also listed in the official German Homoeopathy Pharamacopiea as the “Spagyric after Krauss.” Dr. Ajit Singh practices electrohomeopathy and acupuncture as well as conducts research on medicinal plants in Punja b, India.

Alchemical Transmutation, Spiritual Transformation, and the Artistic Creative Process B y Lisa Falk In my late 30's I found myself at the end of my tether and with no other alternative than to return to what felt right for the sake of my sanity and the freedom of my soul, which was to draw.

"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"allowing myself to be thus used. I had become a dead object, a tool, a trophy – of various people and systems. My first exhibition I titled \"Meditating on Rock.” During the process of producing the 9 drawings that composed this body of work, I unde rtook an investigation into the nature of the human ego, thought and desire, assisted by a man described as a humanist philosopher – Jiddu Krishnamurti. (1) This was a journey into myself; a journey of understanding and self - knowledge based on ruthless hon esty. I had nothing to lose, after all, I was already lost. Physical and psychological trauma had created a wound that was in need of healing but it had also annihilated my ego's cunning defences and thus I was ripe for this undertaking and the confrontati on with my shadow and my soul. As I drew, I saw a mysterious process emerging in my artwork of which I had not previously been aware. I first noticed it in hindsight as I looked back at what I had done; there were metaphors and symbols and apt revealing re ferences in the landscapes I had chosen to depict, and also in the titles I had assigned to them. These things reflected my psyche like an open sunlit window into my heart and mind, or a mercurial mirror through which I could walk into my very soul. This b oth fascinated and unsettled me much as it did the early alchemists, whom in order to understand the nature of matter and the chemicals with which they were experimenting, involuntarily projected yet another mystery into it – their own psychic background. Drawing became a wholistic process of re - integration where virtually all of my activities and actions - even the music I was listening to at the time - became dynamically involved and relevant in relation to the understanding of myself. This was a “truth m editation” and not a honing of concentration or a consolidation of consciousness, nor a “zoning out” that involved suppression and resistance. There was a synthesis occurring - of conscious and unconscious elements of knowledge and action - and a transform ation of “me.” I was breaking free and sprouting wings to meet my destiny. \"When meditation is concerned with the objective products of the unconscious that reach consciousness spontaneously, it unites the conscious with contents that proceed not from a co nscious causal chain but from an essentially unconscious process.\" (2) Later, I realized that the centre of my personality was shifting from the ego to the Self. Carl Jung describes the Self as comprising the totality of the psyche altogether i.e., the conscious and the unconscious – the ego is only the point of reference for consciousness. (3) \" If the secret psychic Person can come forward into the front and, replacing the desire - soul, govern overtly and entirely and not only partially and from behi nd the veil of this outer nature of mind, life and body, then these can be cast into soul images of what is true, right and beautiful and in the end the whole nature can be turned towards the real aim of life, the supreme victory, the ascent into spiritual existence.\" (4) I was undergoing “individuation” – a spiritual transformation whereby a person becomes a psychological ”in - dividual” – a separate, indivisible unity. But whilst meditating on rock, I was not yet aware of this as the process was immediate a nd my knowledge and understanding for the purposes of conscious definition were still lacking. My next body of work, Exhibition 2, I titled \"Reflection, Illusion and Reality.\" Here, I delved deeper into issues of thought, memory, conditioning, war, peace, bliss, meditation, belief systems, seeking, death and disillusionment – the latter two topics seeming especially poignant as I found myself poised on the brink of a precarious, precancerous prognosis. I survived to mount Exhibition 3, which I playfully t itled \" Drawing Out the Spirit,\" simply because, firstly, I draw and secondly because I am interested in understanding the natural essence of all things. Little did I expect what unfolded as I flexed my new found wings. After exploring the nature of ritual , fear, conformity and beauty with the first three pieces, I found myself drawn to a mountainous alpine region of Tasmania called The Labyrinth. On the way there, at sunset, I was mesmerized by a shocking - pink cloud swirling swiftly around the top of a mou ntain like a snaking dragon chasing its tail. Interestingly the origin of the word “dragon” comes from derkesthai , which means “to see.” And the next day, whilst descending The Acropolis, I had a premonition of a friend’s death which was confirmed on my re turn from the wilderness many days later. To date, I had been exploring issues from a very rational base but from this point on I seemed to enter another realm - that of the irrational and the psychic.

Amos, o ne of three small mountains collectively called The Hazards on the east coast. This was the day of the transit of Venus when Venus (love) and the Sun (light) united as one. Only later did I discover the possible significance of Venus transits for global un ity in relation to major breakthroughs in communication. (6) Both Carl - Johan Calleman and Sri Aurobindo propose the next possible and necessary evolutionary step will involve the mind and psychic connections of oneness. Approximately one month later on my 44 th birthday whilst still learning to fly, I came upon an ancient soul. I was resting, perched high on a rocky outcrop surrounded by thigh deep snow and inhaling a 360 degree highland vista. It was the middle of winter in the south - west wilderness, the su n was shining and I was being served “high tea” - I felt like the Queen of Sheba. The ancient Egyptians called the soul the Ba. \"The Ba comes to the place it knows; It does not miss the path of its former life. No form of magic holds it back; It comes to those who offer it water.\" (7) The next three drawings were rock and seascapes. The sea is an excellent symbol of the unconscious realm and a likely place for the birth of visions and invasion by unconscious contents. These drawings came under the title of \"The Gold Nugget Trilogy,\" and are various depictions of The Nuggets, four little islands off the east coast of the bigger island of Tasmania, which lies south of the mainland of Australia. Some alchemists hoped to produce actual gold in their exploration of the chemical world: others hoped to find the “philosophical gold,” the elixir, the panacea, divinity, immortality, God. All I knew was - the more I drew, the more meaningful coincidences occurred in my life and the more it felt like I was being led alo ng by something far greater and more powerful than my petty, conscious ego's apparent needs and desires. I began to have dreams like none that I had ever experienced before – extremely vivid and numinous. These were Oneiros - dreams as originally described by Artemidorus - dreams that awaken and excite the soul. I told no one, but, after having had the first few of these bewildering dreams, I fortunately found myself in possession of a manuscript written by a friend of a friend and based around numinous dre ams that they themselves had had.

This drawing is of a sandstone rock - face with water - rock reflections from the edges of a lake, which I turned side - on and placed like theriomorphic guardians at the gates to the unconscious realm. Delirium is defined as “rapture, enthusiasm and ecstasy,” or “unreal delusions, illusions and hallucinations.” Here also the opposites are united in a tense balance of, and for, reflection – the line between the rock and the water is tenuous, as it is between madness and religious ecstasy, between real ity and illusion, between the real and the surreal. I tread this fine line in the process of individuation. I pass through these gates in the process of understanding and self - knowledge. A phase transition of consciousness occurs at the critical point when the opposites are indistinct, free of conflict, at one and harmonious. The coniunctio is the mystical marriage, the union of the soul with God, of Shiva with Shakti, the male with the female, the conscious with the unconscious. “10” is the goal of the opu s - wholeness through the mirror of wisdom - \" the unity of personality projected into the unity of the stone.\" (2) I draw from a state of love with a clear and open mind and so my drawings are spiritual revelations. I draw out the spirit and the spirit dr aws me, in a dynamic cycle of inspiration and reanimation; this is spiritual transformation akin to alchemical transmutation. I follow Alisanos, my nose, my instincts and my intuition, and then I sweep up the flowers that fall from the heavens. My Kundalin i serpent has awoken and Nataraja dances. The Green Man (11), the archetype of our oneness with the earth, has manifested and is stirring. I am in love with life, and my opalescent soul is soaring untethered and free. _______________________ References: (1) J. Krishnamurti. Commentaries on Living. 1 s t , 2 nd , 3 rd , series.

Return to Top From the Fire b y Dennis William Hauck Daniel Schmidt has alerted me to the fact that someone has patented the ancient alchemical recipe for Oil of Egg. This appears to be an arrogant and flagrant attempt to control ancient wisdom to make money. We all know the miraculous healing powers of Oil of Egg. According to medieval alchemists, Oil of Egg contains highly purified life force energy that can be applied to many ailments. The formula has always been in the public domain, but as of today it is \"illegal\" to make it without a license from a Germ an company. This is an outrage! Frater Albertus' Paralab sold it and making it was part of the the curriculum at Paracelsus College. PON taught it as well. It has been part of the Alchemy Home Study Program through Flamel College for five years. Now, Jurge n Roehmig of Pohlheim, Germany, has taken out a patent on the formulation in 34 countries that makes criminals of us all. Check out the clever way their product is presented at www.roehm ig.com/davinci/html/uk/uk_eggoil_01.htm . Could this be the start of a trend? I have to wonder how long it will be before corporations realize the potential of alchemical preparations and take their production out of the public domain. The basic tenet of p ractical alchemy is that anyone can make tinctures and oils in the privacy of their own homes. Alchemy is a grass roots effort that must remain in the control of people who serve nothing else but the very life force they carry in themselves. We are courtin g disaster if we work with alchemical preparations in any other way but on the personal level. Sorry, I'm just not ready for the Great Work Inc.

I am really curious about the range and variety of answers that appeared in your mind and the minds of other readers when seeing this question. We all have an image or idea that first comes into our consciousness when presented with this question. And yet, because alchemy is a complex, ancient, esoteric concept for most of us, my hunch is that your first idea or picture was a traditional or stereotypical one - perhaps an old man dressed in medieval attire, surrounded by odd utensils, staring into a small furnace – but it changed into a kaleidoscope of other images and concepts. This flux of mental constructs, pict ures, and feelings intrigues me. Somewhere along the broad continuum of definitions of alchemy that is created by each of our various contributions to this question is the answer. And, at some point along this continuum what alchemy truly is becomes a form of alchemy as it is applied or experienced in the world. The three contributors to this issue share descriptions or examples of their work that are related to alchemical processes and can have a direct affect on the experience of our daily lives. Micah Ni lsson makes a distinction between spagyrics and homoeopathy. Both approaches are related to alchemy and create products that directly affect the functioning of our bodies. Dr. Ajit Singh describes Electrohomoeopathy, a method that uses a special technique related to cohobation – a fundamental procedure of alchemy – to create spagyrical treatments. Lisa Falk reveals the unique, personal, transformative process she experiences and uses in her drawings I am certain will affect how you see and feel. Are these i ndividuals alchemists? I can tell you they would not describe themselves as such. Are they practicing alchemy? You tell me. Retur n to Top Submissions Submit your articles on any aspect of alchemy.
