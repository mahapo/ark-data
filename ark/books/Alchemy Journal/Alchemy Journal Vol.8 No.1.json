The medicines, tinctures or essences, if prepared by following the procedures of Separation, Purification and Recombination are called the Spagyric way of making a medicine. By the methods of Separation an d Purification we get the three purified elements of the Plants (Herbs) and then recombine these, which is also called “Cohobation” (Reassembling of the three purified elements of the Plant by means of Spagyrism). It is proved by various researchers that i t is mostly Spagyric essences that are the true medicines and also only the Spagyric essences that are able to overcome the “Vitiation of Blood and Lymph.” H o w a n d W h y ? While making Spagyric essences, they get empowered with the three things: a) Organic compounds basically of lower molecular weight that can easily diffuse through the semi permeable membranes of the cells of tissues, b) Inorganic elements such as macro, micro and trace elements, c) Energy that can also be described as a chain of ato ms bearing the properties of cations and anions, that is ions with positive or negative charges, that are able to take part in the biochemical process or reactions happening within the body’s cells. Thus, we can conclude ultimately that a Spagyric essence is rich in inorganic material, i.e. plant derived minerals salts which can be easily absorbed by the body of living organisms. Physiology revealed that mineral salts are important for all types of biochemistry or biochemical reactions that occur w ithin the cells or tissues. Similarly, trace elements found in very small quantity in living organisms are very crucial for life, play an important role in metabolic reactions and act as catalysts. Now what is the “Vitiation of Blood and Lymph” and how doe s it occur? How are Spagyric Essences Suitable for De - vitiation? We know our body is a result or made up of 24 different elements, but just four of these make up the major part of our body weight. These four are: oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and carbon (C). Hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water. The balance of chemicals in our body depends on our age. Chemical Make up of Our Body or Living Organisms Chemicals are carried around the body dissolved in water. The most important of these is salt o r sodium chloride ( NaCl ). The chemical make up of the body consists of three basic elements: major or macro elements, minor or micro elements and trace elements. The body needs specific amounts of chemicals so that essential chemical reactions can take pl ace to keep the body in good working order. 1) Major elements are: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen. 2) Minor elements are: calcium (1.5%), phosphorus (1.0%), potassium (0.4%), sulfur (0.3%), sodium (6.2%), chlorine (0.2%) and magnesium (0.1%).  M e dicines, tinctures or essences, if prepared by following the procedures of Separation, Purification and Recombination are called the Spagyric way o f m a k i n g a medicine. By the methods of Separation and Purification we get the three purified elements of the Plants (Herbs) and then recombine these, which is also called “Cohobation” (Reassembling of the three purified elements of the Plant by means of Spagyrism). "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3) Trace elements are 0.1% of the body’s weight but are very crucial for life. The main trace elements are: chromium, cobalt, copper, fluoride, iodine, magnese, molbedinum, selenium, silicon, tin and vanedium. The need for water is one of the strongest human driving forces. Water is a transport system and a laboratory for vital chemical reactions. A drop in body water content of 5% causes strong thirst and a drop of around 20% results in death. The human body is composed of many different types of molecu les. Molecules consist of one or more atoms of one or more elements joined by chemicals bonds. So Then What is “Vitiation of Blood and Lymph?” We know that the formation of specific proteins - enzymes may be hampered by the known availability of specific ami no acids/elements in the body and this may cause the stopping or malfunctioning of a specific physiological activity which, if not overcome early, may lead to pathology of the cells and tissues. Blood and lymph are the only two channels to provide all kind s of transportation of the precursors of biomolecules required for biochemical reactions and, if hampered, may cause the stopping or malfunctioning of a specific physiological activity in specific cells and tissues. Thus we can say that if the precursors o f biomolecules required for the proper metabolism of cells and tissues get deficient during transportation through the blood and lymph “Vitiation of Blood and Lymph” occurs. Therefore, only Spagyric medicines, which are rich in precursors of required biome olecules, can overcome the problem of this deficiency of cells and tissue. So, when they are prescribed for the ody, they are able to de - vitiate the blood and lymph by supplying the required deficient precursors of the biomolecules to the body cells for th eir normal structure and function. Are Spagyric Essences Rich in Precursors of Biomolecules? Yes, biomolecules play an important role in living systems and are made up of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen as major constituents. These major constituents are possible to get naturally only by means of Spagyrism. This process is widely used in the system of elect rohomoepathy medicine that believes in the cure of diseases by de - vitiation of the blood and lymph.

Most people couldn't care less about either artform, and yet both house so much of value to humanity. Poets, like alchemists, are dwellers on the fringe; o ften characterized, somewhat tragically, as undesirables, freaks or lunatics. Poets are interpreters of, as A.E. Waite put it in his little - known masterpiece, Azoth; or The Star in the East , “the unrealizable beauty of that which is behind the veil,” doin g so ‘by the graciousness of the veil.” As he so eloquently states: “In this matter the poets are our only interpreters – that is, legitimately – because the problem is outside science, which is concerned with the veil alone; and it is outside ordinary philosophy, because ordinary philosophy has affirmed that the reality is unknowable; and the best conclusions from analogy are to be learned of the masters of analogy, of the kings of interpretation, of those who see furthest, who possess that intuition wh ich is the deepest instrument of supersensual research, and is in fact that higher faculty, that sixth sense, at which we have already hinted, which we now openly affirm is par excellence the mystical instrument. Those only who are in touch with poetry ca n have part in the life to come. It is therefore eminently, and before all things necessary, that we should see after the manner of the poets, and the mystical philosophy of Nature is to be found in them.” Writing poetry for more than ten years, I have explored poetic styles, starting with early lyrical and confessional works, and gradually drifting across the dream - sea towards less sentimental shores, to the sometimes chilly intellectual islands of language poetry (langpo) and other post - modern, non - tra ditional and non - narrative forms where the reader plays the significant role of extracting – or perhaps even allocating – meaning from a poem. The ‘true’ meaning of the poem is often hidden or encoded within multi - layered, largely unpunctuated, stream - o f - consciousness - esque flow of allusive words and sentences and phrases and images ... not always images, but with my own poems, I tend towards image - scapes. One might call them image - puzzles; telling some kind of exoteric 'story' on the surface, but obfusca ting the true meaning. In this sense, my poems are acts of the occult, whereby I tantalize and stimulate language lovers (i.e. the mind) but shield or disguise the truth (i.e. the pearl, the heart) – a kind of poetic 'Green Language' tapping into various traditions and lineages in contemporary Australian and North American poetics. My exploration of the Language of Thoth, the Gay Speech, the Language of the Birds, the Language of God – call it what you will – intensified significantly during the time of the protracted deaths of both my mother and father. During this nineteen - month period I began to think about magic and alchemy, reconnecting with a life - long fascination that had slipped for some years. The spirit of poetry still burned within me, but it had been joined by something else. I became overtaken with the desire to realize the Stone – not simply to understand it conceptually or philosophically, but to facilitate its manifestation.  Poetry has been my gateway to alchemy, as has the death of my solar and lunar progenitors. It hasn't been an easy path, but I am happy with what I have seen and learnt and felt along the way, and where my path seems to be heading in the future. And why not? As Waite put it, “ T h e possession of the spirit of poetry is ... an indispensable condition of achievement; it is the agent of transfiguration; it is the ph ilosophic stone which transmutes the world and man.” "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"As both my parents crept closer to their time to sleep with the earth, the Universal essence flung alchemy before me, every step of the way ... so many markers along an apparent path, so long as I kept myself ‘open’ and didn't try to force anything . There was a transmutation of this matter known as 'me’ whereby a poetic - alchemical product was created ... for the Hermetic Child of Sun and Moon to be born, both parents must die. This is a painful birth, to be certain. I honestly see myself as a living alchemical product, heading towards the Stone. The poems in li ber xix: differentia liber record this transmutation process, this evening of myself to include more 'heart' to balance all of my out - o f - control intellectualism. The nineteen x nineteen - line poems that comprise the suite also document the difference be tween modern man, the immature Adam (45) and God (26). It took nineteen months to write the nineteen - poem suite; nineteen months for both parents to die, and indeed, there are many other nuances of nineteen of significance, both inside and out, above and below. Writing each poem required me to establish contact with the source, the essence , which wasn't always easy or pleasant. These poems changed me, and I know that neither my self nor my writing will be the same again. Coinciding with the agonizing demise of my mother and father, and with my desire for manifesting the Stone (spiritual and physical), I had a chance meeting with an alchemist/spagyricist who quickly became like a brother to me. I read more and more, discussing the Hermetic arts with m y long - time partner and soror mystica , and my newfound brother. I was soon introduced to his alchemical mentor, and since that time, I have had the pleasure of knowing other aspirants to the Stone. All the while, my poetry and alchemy became united toget her, as one art for interpreting Nature. Poetry has been my gateway to alchemy, as has the death of my solar and lunar progenitors. It hasn't been an easy path, but I am happy with what I have seen and learnt and felt along the way, and where my path seems to be heading in the future. And why not?

Return to Top Planetary Attributions of Plants III: A Compilation According to Eleven Bibliographic Sources Currently in Print. B y Johann F. W. Hasler Editor’s Note : The previous two issues of the Alchemy Journal featured the bibliographic research conducted by Johann Hasler with the publication of the first two parts of a series identifying the planetary attributions of plants. The first part included the table for the Sun. The second part included the publication of the next three tables for the Moon, Mercury and Venus. Thi s issue includes the third and final part with  ARTICLES Spagyric Medicine Three Poems Planetary Attributions of Plants III FEATURES New Releases From the Fire Announcements Lectures EDITORIAL From the Editor Submissions Subscriptions Resources Retur n t o T o p "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the publication of the tables for Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. The Introduction to the Series, Notes to the Tables and the Bibliographic Key, published in the previous issues, are included again for easy referenc e. Introduction to the Series During the several years in which I have been studying the magical and alchemical properties of plants according to the Wiccan and Hermetic traditions, I have several times faced at first the confusion, and later the frustrat ion, of noticing that different sources assign different planetary attributions and correspondences to the same plants. One is often faced, while preparing a recipe or determining the components which are more appropriate for a certain working, with the possibility of a certain plant one wishes to work with being assigned to the influence of three, four, and sometimes even five different planets, according to different authors. When these planets are somehow related (like Mars and Saturn being considere d in the past as ‘evil’ or of detrimental, limiting energy), one might attribute this to the development of astrological understanding through time and consequently consider them of the same general limiting intention in light of the more current knowledge . But when the possibilities offered can not be so clearly grouped into one general aura or type of energy, one is left with no other solution than to make an almost random choice based more on the preference one might have for a certain author, publisher, tradition or period of the history of magic than on any other data, especially if one has limited previous experience in working with the problematic plants in question. In time I have come to accept this as a rather typical – and actually something to be expected – o f spiritual sciences such as the Hermetic or Occult sciences, in which personal insight and individual discoveries through meditation, contemplation, or actual communion and communication with the spiritual essences or patron spirits of the plants are considered as valid sources of information as their pharmacological constituents would be. As a matter of fact several of the sources that cite the planetary attributions of plants are well aware of this fact and specifically list more than one planetary correspondence in the entries for some plants, pointing out this fact clearly in their prefaces, footnotes or correspondence tables. In this series of seven compiled tables of correspondences I do not wish to comment or establish a judgment ove r the validity of this and other problematic and strongly criticized epistemological approaches of the alchemy, magical herbalism, Hermeticism and other occult sciences. Yet as a complement to the existing qualitative data which such approaches yield, and which exist profusely, I present here some quantitative data, in this case of a bibliographical nature, so that a decision on the planetary correspondences of plants may be taken by the practitioner based on his or her preference of certain well - known auth ors in the field. I have gotten a hold of eleven recently printed sources that include if not whole tables at least a mention of the planetary correspondences of plants. They include a manual of evocation of spirits, a manual on planetary magic, a comment ed and edited re - print of Agrippa, a manual on the construction of talismans, two manuals on practical alchemy and several magical reference works, either specifically devoted to botanical magic, magical herbalism and magical aromatherapy, or of a wider sc ope. Apart from Donald Tyson’s reprint of Agrippa’s Three Books of Occult Philosophy (first appeared in Antwerp in 1531) all of the sources are modern, and most are still in print and easily obtainable through bookstores or the Internet. I have chosen the se types of sources because the intention of this series is to be an aid to practicing spargyricists, rather than a bibliographical referencing source for historical studies. I have included the Agrippa not only because it is perhaps the single most import ant original source of contemporary natural magic (magia naturalis) but also because, as the rest of the sources I refer to, it is readily available commercially, having been reprinted by    "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Llewellyn in 2004. Notes to the Tables All types, parts and compon ents of plants (trees, shrubs, herbs, seeds, fruits, barks, roots, etc.) have been included in the same table. Likewise, what authors divide in their books into categories such as trees, herbs, oils, essences or incenses/perfumes, has been included in the same table. There is one table for each of the seven ancient planets of alchemy. The plants that different authors assign to each of the planets are listed here, alphabetically. After the name or variations of the name of plants, a list of superscript le tters appears. The key is the first letter of the surname of author or authors of the specific books surveyed, listed below under “Bibliographic Key”. When there are variations in spelling but it is clearly the same plant, the bibliographic key specifies w hich author uses what spelling. For example, CamomileFA, D&Ph, Z, ChamomileW means that Frater Albertus, Denning & Phillips and Zalewski spell the plant camomile, but Whitcomb spells is chamomile. When there are variations in spelling, as listed above (c amomile and chamomile, hellbore and hellebore and so forth), all variations have been listed, usually one after the other in the same line of the table, but sometimes also separately, in alphabetical order. No attempt of correcting possible errors or incon sistencies in this respect has been attempted; the tables simply refer to which book refers to what in what way. If Zalewski, for example, writes celadine while most other authors write celandine, this has been duly noted but not expurgated or corrected in any way. As these tables are thought as an aid for practicing spargyricists, they are designed as a practical directory for quick reference. This is why, for easier location of particular plants, some have been entered twice, always in alphabetical orde r. For example, black pepper appears both as Black pepper but also as Pepper, black. The same rule applies to all plants with composite names, or in the case when spelling varies so greatly as to warrant a different line in the table.

This book contains various forms of divinatio n in general outlines (the author has also written The Complete Guide to Divination ), several forms of psychic protection, as well as lists of crystals, basic universal meanings of symbols, gems, oils, incense and smudge sticks, as well as color meanings.

International Alchemy Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. The International Alchemy Guild (IAG) is currently organizing what looks to be the largest gathering of alchemists and alchemical practitioners in 500 years. The goal is to represent all aspects of alchemy, including the practical and spiritual paths, East and West, and modern perspectives such as transpersonal psychology. The event is scheduled to take place over the Columbus Day weekend, October 5 - 7, 2007, in Las Vegas. Complete information can be found at w ww.AlchemyConference.com .

Return to Top EDITORIAL From the Editor (b y Duane Saari ) For much of its history, alchemy has been a secret, a guarded and obscure way of interacting with the world. It is famous, as well as infamous, for its intentionally hidden writings, laboratory practices and the names of its most important practitioners. There are reasons. Originally, it was considered knowle dge suitable only for an elite ruling or priest class. For a time, this powerful and “dangerous in the hands of the uninitiated” knowledge was shared with only initiates fully committed to its use for the greater good. Later, the Roman Catholic Church incl uded it among the practices of the occult that lead unsuspecting souls to hell rather than heaven and persecuted its practitioners and teachers. Then, many alchemists were used by kings, rulers and the politically powerful for their personal ambitions. Eve ntually, this secret knowledge was driven almost completely into the dark, underground, unexplored side of developing societies and lost to most of us. However, over the last several hundred years, individual alchemists, working alone with the preserved in formation and practices have kept this inheritance alive in their writings and laboratories across the globe. Alchemy is an understanding of the Light and, therefore, cannot be completely hidden away. It seeps out of the dark in myriad ways through the wor k of individual alchemists such as Isaac Newton or in some of the miracles of modern medicine. Its message is also being tapped by poets, songwriters and performers. Examples of how alchemy permeates our culture are all around us. The Secret , a book and D VD published in 2006, is now a world wide phenomenon. According to its creators, the Emerald Tablet is the first statement of the Law of Attraction on which The Secret is based. Recently, I was approached by an individual who is planning a documentary on t he relationship between The Secret and the Emerald Tablet. Just last week, I took the time to review an excerpt from Al Gore’s new book: The Assault on Reason at www.Time.com and came across his use of the word alchemy. Gore was referred to Marshall McLuhan’s description of TV as a cool medium compared to the hot medium of print. Gore says it was hard for him “...to understand when I read it 40 years ago, because the source of “ heat” in his metaphor is the mental work required in the alchemy of reading.” This is a very appropriate and revealing use of the term alchemy, not just a convenient use of the word. Fundamental to the work of alchemy is the use of heat; in some instances it comes from the worldly fire that can burn and in others the Fire of True Imagination – “the fire that does not burn.” Last year, two conferences devoted to alchemy and its teachings were held. One, sponsored by the New York Open Center and co - sponsored by the Alchemy Museum in Kutna Hora and the Lumen Foundation,  For much of its history, alchemy has been a secret, a guarded and obscure way of interacting with the world.

Many of the presenters at this conference spoke about the history of alchemy and its relationship to science. Another alchemy conference will be held in Las Vegas this year on October 6 and 7. This one is sponsored by the International Alchemy Guild. It is attracting a world wide, eclectic group o f individuals using alchemy in many different ways. One of the articles in this issue of the Journal is by Dennis Hauck who is central to the conference’s conception and development. Dennis writes about the purpose of the gathering and his vision for its i mpact. We are surrounded by the influence of alchemy: its use in our public discourse, the expression of our deepest feelings in poetry such as that of Paul Hardacre’s in this issue, global conferences dedicated to it and the world wide response to the publication of The Secret. Lying at the core of the Great Work is the use of light, whether from the fire of calcination or our imagination. Alchemy cannot stay hidden. I believe it is time to bring alchemy out of the dark and reveal its treasures. Let me know if you agree or you don’t. Email me at: alchemyeditor@yahoo.com .
