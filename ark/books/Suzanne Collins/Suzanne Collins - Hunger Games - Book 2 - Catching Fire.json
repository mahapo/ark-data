My muscles are clenched tight against thecold. If a pack of wild dogs were to appear at this moment, the odds of scalinga tree before they attacked are not in my favor. I should get up, move around,and work the stiffness from my limbs. But instead I sit, as motionless as therock beneath me, while the dawn begins to lighten the woods. I can’t fight thesun. I can only watch helplessly as it drags me into a day that I’ve beendreading for months.By noon they will all be at my new house in the Victor’s Village. The reporters,the camera crews, even Effie Trinket, my old escort, will have made their way toDistrict 12 from the Capitol. I wonder if Effie will still be wearing that sillypink wig, or if she’ll be sporting some other unnatural color especially for theVictory Tour. There will be others waiting, too. A staff to cater to my everyneed on the long train trip. A prep team to beautify me for public appearances.My stylist and friend, Cinna, who designed the gorgeous outfits that first madethe audience take notice of me in the Hunger Games.If it were up to me, I would try to forget the Hunger Games entirely. Neverspeak of them. Pretend they were nothing but a bad dream. But the Victory Tourmakes that impossible. Strategically placed almost midway between the annualGames, it is the Capitol’s way of keeping the horror fresh and immediate. Notonly are we in the districts forced to remember the iron grip of the Capitol’spower each year, we are forced to celebrate it. And this year, I am one of thestars of the show. I will have to travel from district to district, to standbefore the cheering crowds who secretly loathe me, to look down into the facesof the families whose children I have killed. . . .The sun persists in rising, so I make myself stand. All my joints complain andmy left leg has been asleep for so long that it takes several minutes of pacingto bring the feeling back into it. I’ve been in the woods three hours, but asI’ve made no real attempt at hunting, I have nothing to show for it. It doesn’tmatter for my mother and little sister, Prim, anymore. They can afford to buybutcher meat in town, although none of us likes it any better than fresh game.But my best friend, Gale Hawthorne, and his family will be depending on today’shaul and I can’t let them down. I start the hour-and-a-half trek it will take tocover our snare line. Back when we were in school, we had time in the afternoonsto check the line and hunt and gather and still get back to trade in town. Butnow that Gale has gone to work in the coal mines — and I have nothing to do allday — I’ve taken over the job.By this time Gale will have clocked in at the mines, taken the stomach-churningelevator ride into the depths of the earth, and be pounding away at a coal seam.I know what it’s like down there. Every year in school, as part of our training,my class had to tour the mines. When I was little, it was just unpleasant. Theclaustrophobic tunnels, foul air, suffocating darkness on all sides. But aftermy father and several other miners were killed in an explosion, I could barelyforce myself onto the elevator. The annual trip became an enormous source ofanxiety. Twice I made myself so sick in anticipation of it that my mother keptme home because she thought I had contracted the flu.I think of Gale, who is only really alive in the woods, with its fresh air andsunlight and clean, flowing water. I don’t know how he stands it. Well . . .yes, I do. He stands it because it’s the way to feed his mother and two youngerbrothers and sister. And here I am with buckets of money, far more than enoughto feed both our families now, and he won’t take a single coin. It’s even hardfor him to let me bring in meat, although he’d surely have kept my mother andPrim supplied if I’d been killed in the Games. I tell him he’s doing me a favor,that it drives me nuts to sit around all day. Even so, I never drop off the gamewhile he’s at home. Which is easy since he works twelve hours a day.The only time I really get to see Gale now is on Sundays, when we meet up in thewoods to hunt together. It’s still the best day of the week, but it’s not likeit used to be before, when we could tell each other anything. The Games havespoiled even that. I keep hoping that as time passes we’ll regain the easebetween us, but part of me knows it’s futile. There’s no going back.I get a good haul from the traps — eight rabbits, two squirrels, and a beaverthat swam into a wire contraption Gale designed himself. He’s something of awhiz with snares, rigging them to bent saplings so they pull the kill out of thereach of predators, balancing logs on delicate stick triggers, weavinginescapable baskets to capture fish. As I go along, carefully resetting eachsnare, I know I can never quite replicate his eye for balance, his instinct forwhere the prey will cross the path. It’s more than experience. It’s a naturalgift. Like the way I can shoot at an animal in almost complete darkness andstill take it down with one arrow.By the time I make it back to the fence that surrounds District 12, the sun iswell up. As always, I listen a moment, but there’s no telltale hum of electricalcurrent running through the chain link. There hardly ever is, even though thething is supposed to be charged full-time. I wriggle through the opening at thebottom of the fence and come up in the Meadow, just a stone’s throw from myhome. My old home. We still get to keep it since officially it’s the designateddwelling of my mother and sister. If I should drop dead right now, they wouldhave to return to it. But at present, they’re both happily installed in the newhouse in the Victor’s Village, and I’m the only one who uses the squat littleplace where I was raised. To me, it’s my real home.I go there now to switch my clothes. Exchange my father’s old leather jacket fora fine wool coat that always seems too tight in the shoulders. Leave my soft,worn hunting boots for a pair of expensive machine-made shoes that my motherthinks are more appropriate for someone of my status. I’ve already stowed my bowand arrows in a hollow log in the woods. Although time is ticking away, I allowmyself a few minutes to sit in the kitchen. It has an abandoned quality with nofire on the hearth, no cloth on the table. I mourn my old life here. We barelyscraped by, but I knew where I fit in, I knew what my place was in the tightlyinterwoven fabric that was our life. I wish I could go back to it because, inretrospect, it seems so secure compared with now, when I am so rich and sofamous and so hated by the authorities in the Capitol.A wailing at the back door demands my attention. I open it to find Buttercup,Prim’s scruffy old tomcat. He dislikes the new house almost as much as I do andalways leaves it when my sister’s at school. We’ve never been particularly fondof each other, but now we have this new bond. I let him in, feed him a chunk ofbeaver fat, and even rub him between the ears for a bit. “You’re hideous, youknow that, right?” I ask him. Buttercup nudges my hand for more petting, but wehave to go. “Come on, you.” I scoop him up with one hand, grab my game bag withthe other, and haul them both out onto the street. The cat springs free anddisappears under a bush.The shoes pinch my toes as I crunch along the cinder street. Cutting down alleysand through backyards gets me to Gale’s house in minutes. His mother, Hazelle,sees me through the window, where she’s bent over the kitchen sink. She driesher hands on her apron and disappears to meet me at the door.I like Hazelle. Respect her. The explosion that killed my father took out herhusband as well, leaving her with three boys and a baby due any day. Less than aweek after she gave birth, she was out hunting the streets for work. The minesweren’t an option, what with a baby to look after, but she managed to getlaundry from some of the merchants in town. At fourteen, Gale, the eldest of thekids, became the main supporter of the family. He was already signed up fortesserae, which entitled them to a meager supply of grain and oil in exchangefor his entering his name extra times in the drawing to become a tribute. On topof that, even back then, he was a skilled trapper. But it wasn’t enough to keepa family of five without Hazelle working her fingers to the bone on thatwashboard. In winter her hands got so red and cracked, they bled at theslightest provocation. Still would if it wasn’t for a salve my mother concocted.But they are determined, Hazelle and Gale, that the other boys, twelve-year-oldRory and ten-year-old Vick, and the baby, four-year-old Posy, will never have tosign up for tesserae.Hazelle smiles when she sees the game. She takes the beaver by the tail, feelingits weight. “He’s going to make a nice stew.” Unlike Gale, she has no problemwith our hunting arrangement.“Good pelt, too,” I answer. It’s comforting here with Hazelle. Weighing themerits of the game, just as we always have. She pours me a mug of herb tea,which I wrap my chilled fingers around gratefully. “You know, when I get backfrom the tour, I was thinking I might take Rory out with me sometimes. Afterschool. Teach him to shoot.”Hazelle nods. “That’d be good. Gale means to, but he’s only got his Sundays, andI think he likes saving those for you.”I can’t stop the redness that floods my cheeks. It’s stupid, of course. Hardlyanybody knows me better than Hazelle. Knows the bond I share with Gale. I’m sureplenty of people assumed that we’d eventually get married even if I never gaveit any thought. But that was before the Games. Before my fellow tribute, PeetaMellark, announced he was madly in love with me. Our romance became a keystrategy for our survival in the arena. Only it wasn’t just a strategy forPeeta. I’m not sure what it was for me. But I know now it was nothing butpainful for Gale. My chest tightens as I think about how, on the Victory Tour,Peeta and I will have to present ourselves as lovers again.I gulp my tea even though it’s too hot and push back from the table. “I betterget going. Make myself presentable for the cameras.”Hazelle hugs me. “Enjoy the food.”“Absolutely,” I say.My next stop is the Hob, where I’ve traditionally done the bulk of my trading.Years ago it was a warehouse to store coal, but when it fell into disuse, itbecame a meeting place for illegal trades and then blossomed into a full-timeblack market. If it attracts a somewhat criminal element, then I belong here, Iguess. Hunting in the woods surrounding District 12 violates at least a dozenlaws and is punishable by death.Although they never mention it, I owe the people who frequent the Hob. Gale toldme that Greasy Sae, the old woman who serves up soup, started a collection tosponsor Peeta and me during the Games. It was supposed to be just a Hob thing,but a lot of other people heard about it and chipped in. I don’t know exactlyhow much it was, and the price of any gift in the arena was exorbitant. But forall I know, it made the difference between my life and death.It’s still odd to drag open the front door with an empty game bag, with nothingto trade, and instead feel the heavy pocket of coins against my hip. I try tohit as many stalls as possible, spreading out my purchases of coffee, buns,eggs, yarn, and oil. As an afterthought, I buy three bottles of white liquorfrom a one-armed woman named Ripper, a victim of a mine accident who was smartenough to find a way to stay alive.The liquor isn’t for my family. It’s for Haymitch, who acted as mentor for Peetaand me in the Games. He’s surly, violent, and drunk most of the time. But he didhis job — more than his job — because for the first time in history, twotributes were allowed to win. So no matter who Haymitch is, I owe him, too. Andthat’s for always. I’m getting the white liquor because a few weeks ago he ranout and there was none for sale and he had a withdrawal, shaking and screamingat terrifying things only he could see. He scared Prim to death and, frankly, itwasn’t much fun for me to see him like that, either. Ever since then I’ve beensort of stockpiling the stuff just in case there’s a shortage again.Cray, our Head Peacekeeper, frowns when he sees me with the bottles. He’s anolder man with a few strands of silver hair combed sideways above his bright redface. “That stuff’s too strong for you, girl.” He should know. Next to Haymitch,Cray drinks more than anyone I’ve ever met.“Aw, my mother uses it in medicines,” I say indifferently.“Well, it’d kill just about anything,” he says, and slaps down a coin for abottle.When I reach Greasy Sae’s stall, I boost myself up to sit on the counter andorder some soup, which looks to be some kind of gourd and bean mixture. APeacekeeper named Darius comes up and buys a bowl while I’m eating. As lawenforcers go, he’s one of my favorites. Never really throwing his weight around,usually good for a joke. He’s probably in his twenties, but he doesn’t seem mucholder than I do. Something about his smile, his red hair that sticks out everywhich way, gives him a boyish quality.“Aren’t you supposed to be on a train?” he asks me.“They’re collecting me at noon,” I answer.“Shouldn’t you look better?” he asks in a loud whisper. I can’t help smiling athis teasing, in spite of my mood. “Maybe a ribbon in your hair or something?” Heflicks my braid with his hand and I brush him away.“Don’t worry. By the time they get through with me I’ll be unrecognizable,” Isay.“Good,” he says. “Let’s show a little district pride for a change, MissEverdeen. Hm?” He shakes his head at Greasy Sae in mock disapproval and walksoff to join his friends.“I’ll want that bowl back,” Greasy Sae calls after him, but since she’slaughing, she doesn’t sound particularly stern. “Gale going to see you off?” sheasks me.“No, he wasn’t on the list,” I say. “I saw him Sunday, though.”“Think he’d have made the list. Him being your cousin and all,” she says wryly.It’s just one more part of the lie the Capitol has concocted. When Peeta and Imade it into the final eight in the Hunger Games, they sent reporters to dopersonal stories about us. When they asked about my friends, everyone directedthem to Gale. But it wouldn’t do, what with the romance I was playing out in thearena, to have my best friend be Gale. He was too handsome, too male, and notthe least bit willing to smile and play nice for the cameras. We do resembleeach other, though, quite a bit. We have that Seam look. Dark straight hair,olive skin, gray eyes. So some genius made him my cousin. I didn’t know about ituntil we were already home, on the platform at the train station, and my mothersaid, “Your cousins can hardly wait to see you!” Then I turned and saw Gale andHazelle and all the kids waiting for me, so what could I do but go along?Greasy Sae knows we’re not related, but even some of the people who have knownus for years seem to have forgotten.“I just can’t wait for the whole thing to be over,” I whisper.“I know,” says Greasy Sae. “But you’ve got to go through it to get to the end ofit. Better not be late.”A light snow starts to fall as I make my way to the Victor’s Village. It’s abouta half-mile walk from the square in the center of town, but it seems likeanother world entirely. It’s a separate community built around a beautifulgreen, dotted with flowering bushes. There are twelve houses, each large enoughto hold ten of the one I was raised in. Nine stand empty, as they always have.The three in use belong to Haymitch, Peeta, and me.The houses inhabited by my family and Peeta give off a warm glow of life. Litwindows, smoke from the chimneys, bunches of brightly colored corn affixed tothe front doors as decoration for the upcoming Harvest Festival. However,Haymitch’s house, despite the care taken by the grounds-keeper, exudes an air ofabandonment and neglect. I brace myself at his front door, knowing it will befoul, then push inside.My nose immediately wrinkles in disgust. Haymitch refuses to let anyone in toclean and does a poor job himself. Over the years the odors of liquor and vomit,boiled cabbage and burned meat, unwashed clothes and mouse droppings haveintermingled into a stench that brings tears to my eyes. I wade through a litterof discarded wrappings, broken glass, and bones to where I know I will findHaymitch. He sits at the kitchen table, his arms sprawled across the wood, hisface in a puddle of liquor, snoring his head off.I nudge his shoulder. “Get up!” I say loudly, because I’ve learned there’s nosubtle way to wake him. His snoring stops for a moment, questioningly, and thenresumes. I push him harder. “Get up, Haymitch. It’s tour day!” I force thewindow up, inhaling deep breaths of the clean air outside. My feet shift throughthe garbage on the floor, and I unearth a tin coffeepot and fill it at the sink.The stove isn’t completely out and I manage to coax the few live coals into aflame. I pour some ground coffee into the pot, enough to make sure the resultingbrew will be good and strong, and set it on the stove to boil.Haymitch is still dead to the world. Since nothing else has worked, I fill abasin with icy cold water, dump it on his head, and spring out of the way. Aguttural animal sound comes from his throat. He jumps up, kicking his chair tenfeet behind him and wielding a knife. I forgot he always sleeps with oneclutched in his hand. I should have pried it from his fingers, but I’ve had alot on my mind. Spewing profanity, he slashes the air a few moments beforecoming to his senses. He wipes his face on his shirtsleeve and turns to thewindowsill where I perch, just in case I need to make a quick exit.“What are you doing?” he sputters.“You told me to wake you an hour before the cameras come,” I say.“What?” he says.“Your idea,” I insist.He seems to remember. “Why am I all wet?”“I couldn’t shake you awake,” I say. “Look, if you wanted to be babied, youshould have asked Peeta.”“Asked me what?” Just the sound of his voice twists my stomach into a knot ofunpleasant emotions like guilt, sadness, and fear. And longing. I might as welladmit there’s some of that, too. Only it has too much competition to ever winout.I watch as Peeta crosses to the table, the sunlight from the window picking upthe glint of fresh snow in his blond hair. He looks strong and healthy, sodifferent from the sick, starving boy I knew in the arena, and you can barelyeven notice his limp now. He sets a loaf of fresh-baked bread on the table andholds out his hand to Haymitch.“Asked you to wake me without giving me pneumonia,” says Haymitch, passing overhis knife. He pulls off his filthy shirt, revealing an equally soiledundershirt, and rubs himself down with the dry part.Peeta smiles and douses Haymitch’s knife in white liquor from a bottle on thefloor. He wipes the blade clean on his shirttail and slices the bread. Peetakeeps all of us in fresh baked goods. I hunt. He bakes. Haymitch drinks. We haveour own ways to stay busy, to keep thoughts of our time as contestants in theHunger Games at bay. It’s not until he’s handed Haymitch the heel that he evenlooks at me for the first time. “Would you like a piece?”“No, I ate at the Hob,” I say. “But thank you.” My voice doesn’t sound like myown, it’s so formal. Just as it’s been every time I’ve spoken to Peeta since thecameras finished filming our happy homecoming and we returned to our real lives.“You’re welcome,” he says back stiffly.Haymitch tosses his shirt somewhere into the mess. “Brrr. You two have got a lotof warming up to do before showtime.”He’s right, of course. The audience will be expecting the pair of lovebirds whowon the Hunger Games. Not two people who can barely look each other in the eye.But all I say is, “Take a bath, Haymitch.” Then I swing out the window, drop tothe ground, and head across the green to my house.The snow has begun to stick and I leave a trail of footprints behind me. At thefront door, I pause to knock the wet stuff from my shoes before I go in. Mymother’s been working day and night to make everything perfect for the cameras,so it’s no time to be tracking up her shiny floors. I’ve barely stepped insidewhen she’s there, holding my arm as if to stop me.“Don’t worry, I’m taking them off here,” I say, leaving my shoes on the mat.My mother gives an odd, breathy laugh and removes the game bag loaded withsupplies from my shoulder. “It’s just snow. Did you have a nice walk?”“Walk?” She knows I’ve been in the woods half the night. Then I see the manstanding behind her in the kitchen doorway. One look at his tailored suit andsurgically perfected features and I know he’s from the Capitol. Something iswrong. “It was more like skating. It’s really getting slippery out there.”“Someone’s here to see you,” says my mother. Her face is too pale and I can hearthe anxiety she’s trying to hide.“I thought they weren’t due until noon.” I pretend not to notice her state. “DidCinna come early to help me get ready?”“No, Katniss, it’s —” my mother begins.“This way, please, Miss Everdeen,” says the man. He gestures down the hallway.It’s weird to be ushered around your own home, but I know better than to commenton it.As I go, I give my mother a reassuring smile over my shoulder. “Probably moreinstructions for the tour.” They’ve been sending me all kinds of stuff about myitinerary and what protocol will be observed in each district. But as I walktoward the door of the study, a door I have never even seen closed until thismoment, I can feel my mind begin to race. Who is here? What do they want? Why ismy mother so pale?“Go right in,” says the Capitol man, who has followed me down the hallway.I twist the polished brass knob and step inside. My nose registers theconflicting scents of roses and blood. A small, white-haired man who seemsvaguely familiar is reading a book. He holds up a finger as if to say, “Give mea moment.” Then he turns and my heart skips a beat.I’m staring into the snakelike eyes of President Snow."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00037.jpg]In my mind, President Snow should be viewed in front of marble pillars hung withoversized flags. It’s jarring to see him surrounded by the ordinary objects inthe room. Like taking the lid off a pot and finding a fanged viper instead ofstew.What could he be doing here? My mind rushes back to the opening days of otherVictory Tours. I remember seeing the winning tributes with their mentors andstylists. Even some high government officials have made appearancesoccasionally. But I have never seen President Snow. He attends celebrations inthe Capitol. Period.If he’s made the journey all the way from his city, it can only mean one thing.I’m in serious trouble. And if I am, so is my family. A shiver goes through mewhen I think of the proximity of my mother and sister to this man who despisesme. Will always despise me. Because I outsmarted his sadistic Hunger Games, madethe Capitol look foolish, and consequently undermined his control.All I was doing was trying to keep Peeta and myself alive. Any act of rebellionwas purely coincidental. But when the Capitol decrees that only one tribute canlive and you have the audacity to challenge it, I guess that’s a rebellion initself. My only defense was pretending that I was driven insane by a passionatelove for Peeta. So we were both allowed to live. To be crowned victors. To gohome and celebrate and wave good-bye to the cameras and be left alone. Untilnow.Perhaps it is the newness of the house or the shock of seeing him or the mutualunderstanding that he could have me killed in a second that makes me feel likethe intruder. As if this is his home and I’m the uninvited party. So I don’twelcome him or offer him a chair. I don’t say anything. In fact, I treat him asif he’s a real snake, the venomous kind. I stand motionless, my eyes locked ohim, considering plans of retreat.“I think we’ll make this whole situation a lot simpler by agreeing not to lie toeach other,” he says. “What do you think?”I think my tongue has frozen and speech will be impossible, so I surprise myselfby answering back in a steady voice, “Yes, I think that would save time.”President Snow smiles and I notice his lips for the first time. I’m expectingsnake lips, which is to say none. But his are overly full, the skin stretchedtoo tight. I have to wonder if his mouth has been altered to make him moreappealing. If so, it was a waste of time and money, because he’s not appealingat all. “My advisors were concerned you would be difficult, but you’re notplanning on being difficult, are you?” he asks.“No,” I answer.“That’s what I told them. I said any girl who goes to such lengths to preserveher life isn’t going to be interested in throwing it away with both hands. Andthen there’s her family to think of. Her mother, her sister, and all those . . .cousins.” By the way he lingers on the word “cousins,” I can tell he knows thatGale and I don’t share a family tree.Well, it’s all on the table now. Maybe that’s better. I don’t do well withambiguous threats. I’d much rather know the score.“Let’s sit.” President Snow takes a seat at the large desk of polished woodwhere Prim does her homework and my mother her budgets. Like our home, this is aplace that he has no right, but ultimately every right, to occupy. I sit infront of the desk on one of the carved, straight-backed chairs. It’s made forsomeone taller than I am, so only my toes rest on the ground.“I have a problem, Miss Everdeen,” says President Snow. “A problem that beganthe moment you pulled out those poisonous berries in the arena.”That was the moment when I guessed that if the Gamemakers had to choose betweenwatching Peeta and me commit suicide — which would mean having no victor — andletting us both live, they would take the latter.“If the Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane, had had any brains, he’d have blown you todust right then. But he had an unfortunate sentimental streak. So here you are.Can you guess where he is?” he asks.I nod because, by the way he says it, it’s clear that Seneca Crane has beenexecuted. The smell of roses and blood has grown stronger now that only a deskseparates us. There’s a rose in President Snow’s lapel, which at least suggestsa source of the flower perfume, but it must be genetically enhanced, because noreal rose reeks like that. As for the blood . . . I don’t know.“After that, there was nothing to do but let you play out your little scenario.And you were pretty good, too, with the love-crazed schoolgirl bit. The peoplein the Capitol were quite convinced. Unfortunately, not everyone in thedistricts fell for your act,” he says.My face must register at least a flicker of bewilderment, because he addressesit.“This, of course, you don’t know. You have no access to information about themood in other districts. In several of them, however, people viewed your littletrick with the berries as an act of defiance, not an act of love. And if a girlfrom District Twelve of all places can defy the Capitol and walk away unharmed,what is to stop them from doing the same?” he says. “What is to prevent, say, anuprising?”It takes a moment for his last sentence to sink in. Then the full weight of ithits me. “There have been uprisings?” I ask, both chilled and somewhat elated bythe possibility.“Not yet. But they’ll follow if the course of things doesn’t change. Anduprisings have been known to lead to revolution.” President Snow rubs a spotover his left eyebrow, the very spot where I myself get headaches. “Do you haveany idea what that would mean? How many people would die? What conditions thoseleft would have to face? Whatever problems anyone may have with the Capitol,believe me when I say that if it released its grip on the districts for even ashort time, the entire system would collapse.”I’m taken aback by the directness and even the sincerity of this speech. As ifhis primary concern is the welfare of the citizens of Panem, when nothing couldbe further from the truth. I don’t know how I dare to say the next words, but Ido. “It must be very fragile, if a handful of berries can bring it down.”There’s a long pause while he examines me. Then he simply says, “It is fragile,but not in the way that you suppose.”There’s a knock at the door, and the Capitol man sticks his head in. “Her motherwants to know if you want tea.”“I would. I would like tea,” says the president. The door opens wider, and therestands my mother, holding a tray with a china tea set she brought to the Seamwhen she married. “Set it here, please.” He places his book on the corner of thedesk and pats the center.My mother sets the tray on the desk. It holds a china teapot and cups, cream andsugar, and a plate of cookies. They are beautifully iced with softly coloredflowers. The frosting work can only be Peeta’s.“What a welcome sight. You know, it’s funny how often people forget thatpresidents need to eat, too,” President Snow says charmingly. Well, it seems torelax my mother a bit, anyway.“Can I get you anything else? I can cook something more substantial if you’rehungry,” she offers.“No, this could not be more perfect. Thank you,” he says, clearly dismissingher. My mother nods, shoots me a glance, and goes. President Snow pours tea forboth of us and fills his with cream and sugar, then takes a long time stirring.I sense he has had his say and is waiting for me to respond.“I didn’t mean to start any uprisings,” I tell him.“I believe you. It doesn’t matter. Your stylist turned out to be prophetic inhis wardrobe choice. Katniss Everdeen, the girl who was on fire, you haveprovided a spark that, left unattended, may grow to an inferno that destroysPanem,” he says.“Why don’t you just kill me now?” I blurt out.“Publicly?” he asks. “That would only add fuel to the flames.”“Arrange an accident, then,” I say.“Who would buy it?” he asks. “Not you, if you were watching.”“Then just tell me what you want me to do. I’ll do it,” I say.“If only it were that simple.” He picks up one of the flowered cookies andexamines it. “Lovely. Your mother made these?”“Peeta.” And for the first time, I find I can’t hold his gaze. I reach for mytea but set it back down when I hear the cup rattling against the saucer. Tocover I quickly take a cookie.“Peeta. How is the love of your life?” he asks.“Good,” I say.“At what point did he realize the exact degree of your indifference?” he asks,dipping his cookie in his tea.“I’m not indifferent,” I say.“But perhaps not as taken with the young man as you would have the countrybelieve,” he says.“Who says I’m not?” I say.“I do,” says the president. “And I wouldn’t be here if I were the only personwho had doubts. How’s the handsome cousin?”“I don’t know . . . I don’t . . .” My revulsion at this conversation, atdiscussing my feelings for two of the people I care most about with PresidentSnow, chokes me off.“Speak, Miss Everdeen. Him I can easily kill off if we don’t come to a happyresolution,” he says. “You aren’t doing him a favor by disappearing into thewoods with him each Sunday.”If he knows this, what else does he know? And how does he know it? Many peoplecould tell him that Gale and I spend our Sundays hunting. Don’t we show up atthe end of each one loaded down with game? Haven’t we for years? The realquestion is what he thinks goes on in the woods beyond District 12. Surely theyhaven’t been tracking us in there. Or have they? Could we have been followed?That seems impossible. At least by a person. Cameras? That never crossed my minduntil this moment. The woods have always been our place of safety, our placebeyond the reach of the Capitol, where we’re free to say what we feel, be who weare. At least before the Games. If we’ve been watched since, what have theyseen? Two people hunting, saying treasonous things against the Capitol, yes. Butnot two people in love, which seems to be President Snow’s implication. We aresafe on that charge. Unless . . . unless . . .It only happened once. It was fast and unexpected, but it did happen.After Peeta and I got home from the Games, it was several weeks before I sawGale alone. First there were the obligatory celebrations. A banquet for thevictors that only the most high-ranking people were invited to. A holiday forthe whole district with free food and entertainers brought in from the Capitol.Parcel Day, the first of twelve, in which food packages were delivered to everyperson in the district. That was my favorite. To see all those hungry kids inthe Seam running around, waving cans of applesauce, tins of meat, even candy.Back home, too big to carry, would be bags of grain, cans of oil. To know thatonce a month for a year they would all receive another parcel. That was one ofthe few times I actually felt good about winning the Games.So between the ceremonies and events and the reporters documenting my every moveas I presided and thanked and kissed Peeta for the audience, I had no privacy atall. After a few weeks, things finally died down. The camera crews and reporterspacked up and went home. Peeta and I assumed the cool relationship we’ve hadever since. My family settled into our house in the Victor’s Village. Theeveryday life of District 12 — workers to the mines, kids to school — resumedits usual pace. I waited until I thought the coast was really clear, and thenone Sunday, without telling anyone, I got up hours before dawn and took off forthe woods.The weather was still warm enough that I didn’t need a jacket. I packed along abag filled with special foods, cold chicken and cheese and bakery bread andoranges. Down at my old house, I put on my hunting boots. As usual, the fencewas not charged and it was simple to slip into the woods and retrieve my bow andarrows. I went to our place, Gale’s and mine, where we had shared breakfast themorning of the reaping that sent me into the Games.I waited at least two hours. I’d begun to think that he’d given up on me in theweeks that had passed. Or that he no longer cared about me. Hated me even. Andthe idea of losing him forever, my best friend, the only person I’d ever trustedwith my secrets, was so painful I couldn’t stand it. Not on top of everythingelse that had happened. I could feel my eyes tearing up and my throat startingto close the way it does when I get upset.Then I looked up and there he was, ten feet away, just watching me. Without eventhinking, I jumped up and threw my arms around him, making some weird sound thatcombined laughing, choking, and crying. He was holding me so tightly that Icouldn’t see his face, but it was a really long time before he let me go andthen he didn’t have much choice, because I’d gotten this unbelievably loud caseof the hiccups and had to get a drink.We did what we always did that day. Ate breakfast. Hunted and fished andgathered. Talked about people in town. But not about us, his new life in themines, my time in the arena. Just about other things. By the time we were at thehole in the fence that’s nearest the Hob, I think I really believed that thingscould be the same. That we could go on as we always had. I’d given all the gameto Gale to trade since we had so much food now. I told him I’d skip the Hob,even though I was looking forward to going there, because my mother and sisterdidn’t even know I’d gone hunting and they’d be wondering where I was. Thensuddenly, as I was suggesting I take over the daily snare run, he took my facein his hands and kissed me.I was completely unprepared. You would think that after all the hours I’d spentwith Gale — watching him talk and laugh and frown — that I would know all therewas to know about his lips. But I hadn’t imagined how warm they would feelpressed against my own. Or how those hands, which could set the most intricateof snares, could as easily entrap me. I think I made some sort of noise in theback of my throat, and I vaguely remember my fingers, curled tightly closed,resting on his chest. Then he let go and said, “I had to do that. At leastonce.” And he was gone.Despite the fact that the sun was setting and my family would be worried, I satby a tree next to the fence. I tried to decide how I felt about the kiss, if Ihad liked it or resented it, but all I really remembered was the pressure ofGale’s lips and the scent of the oranges that still lingered on his skin. It waspointless comparing it with the many kisses I’d exchanged with Peeta. I stillhadn’t figured out if any of those counted. Finally I went home.That week I managed the snares and dropped off the meat with Hazelle. But Ididn’t see Gale until Sunday. I had this whole speech worked out, about how Ididn’t want a boyfriend and never planned on marrying, but I didn’t end up usingit. Gale acted as if the kiss had never happened. Maybe he was waiting for me tosay something. Or kiss him back. Instead I just pretended it had never happened,either. But it had. Gale had shattered some invisible barrier between us and,with it, any hope I had of resuming our old, uncomplicated friendship. WhateverI pretended, I could never look at his lips in quite the same way.This all flashes through my head in an instant as President Snow’s eyes boreinto me on the heels of his threat to kill Gale. How stupid I’ve been to thinkthe Capitol would just ignore me once I’d returned home! Maybe I didn’t knowabout the potential uprisings. But I knew they were angry with me. Instead ofacting with the extreme caution the situation called for, what have I done? Fromthe president’s point of view, I’ve ignored Peeta and flaunted my preference forGale’s company before the whole district. And by doing so made it clear I was,in fact, mocking the Capitol. Now I’ve endangered Gale and his family and myfamily and Peeta, too, by my carelessness.“Please don’t hurt Gale,” I whisper. “He’s just my friend. He’s been my friendfor years. That’s all that’s between us. Besides, everyone thinks we’re cousinsnow.”“I’m only interested in how it affects your dynamic with Peeta, therebyaffecting the mood in the districts,” he says.“It will be the same on the tour. I’ll be in love with him just as I was,” Isay.“Just as you are,” corrects President Snow.“Just as I am,” I confirm.“Only you’ll have to do even better if the uprisings are to be averted,” hesays. “This tour will be your only chance to turn things around.”“I know. I will. I’ll convince everyone in the districts that I wasn’t defyingthe Capitol, that I was crazy with love,” I say.President Snow rises and dabs his puffy lips with a napkin. “Aim higher in caseyou fall short.”“What do you mean? How can I aim higher?” I ask.“Convince"},{"pageContent":"me,” he says. He drops the napkin and retrieves his book. I don’t watch him ashe heads for the door, so I flinch when he whispers in my ear. “By the way, Iknow about the kiss.” Then the door clicks shut behind him."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00007.jpg]The smell of blood . . . it was on his breath.What does he do? I think. Drink it? I imagine him sipping it from a teacup.Dipping a cookie into the stuff and pulling it out dripping red.Outside the window, a car comes to life, soft and quiet like the purr of a cat,then fades away into the distance. It slips off as it arrived, unnoticed.The room seems to be spinning in slow, lopsided circles, and I wonder if I mightblack out. I lean forward and clutch the desk with one hand. The other stillholds Peeta’s beautiful cookie. I think it had a tiger lily on it, but now it’sbeen reduced to crumbs in my fist. I didn’t even know I was crushing it, but Iguess I had to hold on to something while my world veered out of control.A visit from President Snow. Districts on the verge of uprisings. A direct deaththreat to Gale, with others to follow. Everyone I love doomed. And who knows whoelse will pay for my actions? Unless I turn things around on this tour. Quietthe discontent and put the president’s mind at rest. And how? By proving to thecountry beyond any shadow of a doubt that I love Peeta Mellark.I can’t do it, I think. I’m not that good. Peeta’s the good one, the likableone. He can make people believe anything. I’m the one who shuts up and sits backand lets him do as much of the talking as possible. But it isn’t Peeta who hasto prove his devotion. It’s me.I hear my mother’s light, quick tread in the hall. She can’t know, I think. Notabout any of this. I reach my hands over the tray and quickly brush the bits ofcookie from my palm and fingers. I take a shaky sip of my tea.“Is everything all right, Katniss?” she asks.“It’s fine. We never see it on television, but the president always visits thevictors before the tour to wish them luck,” I say brightly.My mother’s face floods with relief. “Oh. I thought there was some kind oftrouble.”“No, not at all,” I say. “The trouble will start when my prep team sees how I’velet my eyebrows grow back in.” My mother laughs, and I think about how there wasno going back after I took over caring for the family when I was eleven. How Iwill always have to protect her.“Why don’t I start your bath?” she asks.“Great,” I say, and I can see how pleased she is by my response.Since I’ve been home I’ve been trying hard to mend my relationship with mymother. Asking her to do things for me instead of brushing aside any offer ofhelp, as I did for years out of anger. Letting her handle all the money I won.Returning her hugs instead of tolerating them. My time in the arena made merealize how I needed to stop punishing her for something she couldn’t help,specifically the crushing depression she fell into after my father’s death.Because sometimes things happen to people and they’re not equipped to deal withthem.Like me, for instance. Right now.Besides, there’s one wonderful thing she did when I arrived back in thedistrict. After our families and friends had greeted Peeta and me at the trainstation, there were a few questions allowed from reporters. Someone asked mymother what she thought of my new boyfriend, and she replied that, while Peetawas the very model of what a young man should be, I wasn’t old enough to haveany boyfriend at all. She followed this with a pointed look at Peeta. There wasa lot of laughter and comments like “Somebody’s in trouble” from the press, andPeeta dropped my hand and sidestepped away from me. That didn’t last long —there was too much pressure to act otherwise — but it gave us an excuse to be alittle more reserved than we’d been in the Capitol. And maybe it can helpaccount for how little I’ve been seen in Peeta’s company since the cameras left.I go upstairs to the bathroom, where a steaming tub awaits. My mother has addeda small bag of dried flowers that perfumes the air. None of us are used to theluxury of turning on a tap and having a limitless supply of hot water at ourfingertips. We had only cold at our home in the Seam, and a bath meant boilingthe rest over the fire. I undress and lower myself into the silky water — mymother has poured in some kind of oil as well — and try to get a grip on things.The first question is who to tell, if anyone. Not my mother or Prim, obviously;they’d only become sick with worry. Not Gale. Even if I could get word to him.What would he do with the information, anyway? If he were alone, I might try topersuade him to run away. Certainly he could survive in the woods. But he’s notalone and he’d never leave his family. Or me. When I get home I’ll have to tellhim something about why our Sundays are a thing of the past, but I can’t thinkabout that now. Only about my next move. Besides, Gale’s already so angry andfrustrated with the Capitol that I sometimes think he’s going to arrange his ownuprising. The last thing he needs is an incentive. No, I can’t tell anyone I’mleaving behind in District 12.There are still three people I might confide in, starting with Cinna, mystylist. But my guess is Cinna might already be at risk, and I don’t want topull him into any more trouble by closer association with me. Then there’sPeeta, who will be my partner in this deception, but how do I begin thatconversation? Hey, Peeta, remember how I told you I was kind of faking being inlove with you? Well, I really need you to forget about that now and act extra inlove with me or the president might kill Gale. I can’t do it. Besides, Peetawill perform well whether he knows what’s at stake or not. That leaves Haymitch.Drunken, cranky, confrontational Haymitch, who I just poured a basin of icewater on. As my mentor in the Games it was his duty to keep me alive. I onlyhope he’s still up for the job.I slide down into the water, letting it block out the sounds around me. I wishthe tub would expand so I could go swimming, like I used to on hot summerSundays in the woods with my father. Those days were a special treat. We wouldleave early in the morning and hike farther into the woods than usual to a smalllake he’d found while hunting. I don’t even remember learning to swim, I was soyoung when he taught me. I just remember diving, turning somersaults, andpaddling around. The muddy bottom of the lake beneath my toes. The smell ofblossoms and greenery. Floating on my back, as I am now, staring at the blue skywhile the chatter of the woods was muted by the water. He’d bag the waterfowlthat nested around the shore, I’d hunt for eggs in the grasses, and we’d bothdig for katniss roots, the plant for which he named me, in the shallows. Atnight, when we got home, my mother would pretend not to recognize me because Iwas so clean. Then she’d cook up an amazing dinner of roasted duck and bakedkatniss tubers with gravy.I never took Gale to the lake. I could have. It’s time-consuming to get there,but the waterfowl are such easy pickings you can make up for lost hunting time.It’s a place I’ve never really wanted to share with anyone, though, a place thatbelonged only to my father and me. Since the Games, when I’ve had little tooccupy my days, I’ve gone there a couple of times. The swimming was still nice,but mostly the visits depressed me. Over the course of the last five years, thelake’s remarkably unchanged and I’m almost unrecognizable.Even underwater I can hear the sounds of commotion. Honking car horns, shouts ofgreeting, doors banging shut. It can only mean my entourage has arrived. I justhave time to towel off and slip into a robe before my prep team bursts into thebathroom. There’s no question of privacy. When it comes to my body, we have nosecrets, these three people and me.“Katniss, your eyebrows!” Venia shrieks right off, and even with the black cloudhanging over me, I have to stifle a laugh. Her aqua hair has been styled so itsticks out in sharp points all over her head, and the gold tattoos that used tobe confined above her brows have curled around under her eyes, all contributingto the impression that I’ve literally shocked her.Octavia comes up and pats Venia’s back soothingly, her curvy body lookingplumper than usual next to Venia’s thin, angular one. “There, there. You can fixthose in no time. But what am I going to do with these nails?” She grabs my handand pins it flat between her two pea green ones. No, her skin isn’t exactly peagreen now. It’s more of a light evergreen. The shift in shade is no doubt anattempt to stay abreast of the capricious fashion trends of the Capitol.“Really, Katniss, you could have left me something to work with!” she wails.It’s true. I’ve bitten my nails to stubs in the past couple of months. I thoughtabout trying to break the habit but couldn’t think of a good reason I should.“Sorry,” I mutter. I hadn’t really been spending much time worrying about how itmight affect my prep team.Flavius lifts a few strands of my wet, tangled hair. He gives his head adisapproving shake, causing his orange corkscrew curls to bounce around. “Hasanyone touched this since you last saw us?” he asks sternly. “Remember, wespecifically asked you to leave your hair alone.”“Yes!” I say, grateful that I can show I haven’t totally taken them for granted.“I mean, no, no one’s cut it. I did remember that.” No, I didn’t. It’s more likethe issue never came up. Since I’ve been home, all I’ve done is stick it in itsusual old braid down my back.This seems to mollify them, and they all kiss me, set me on a chair in mybedroom, and, as usual, start talking nonstop without bothering to notice if I’mlistening. While Venia reinvents my eyebrows and Octavia gives me fake nails andFlavius massages goo into my hair, I hear all about the Capitol. What a hit theGames were, how dull things have been since, how no one can wait until Peeta andI visit again at the end of the Victory Tour. After that, it won’t be longbefore the Capitol begins gearing up for the Quarter Quell.“Isn’t it thrilling?”“Don’t you feel so lucky?”“In your very first year of being a victor, you get to be a mentor in a QuarterQuell!”Their words overlap in a blur of excitement.“Oh, yes,” I say neutrally. It’s the best I can do. In a normal year, being amentor to the tributes is the stuff of nightmares. I can’t walk by the schoolnow without wondering what kid I’ll have to coach. But to make things evenworse, this is the year of the Seventy-fifth Hunger Games, and that means it’salso a Quarter Quell. They occur every twenty-five years, marking theanniversary of the districts’ defeat with over-the-top celebrations and, forextra fun, some miserable twist for the tributes. I’ve never been alive for one,of course. But in school I remember hearing that for the second Quarter Quell,the Capitol demanded that twice the number of tributes be provided for thearena. The teachers didn’t go into much more detail, which is surprising,because that was the year District 12’s very own Haymitch Abernathy won thecrown.“Haymitch better be preparing himself for a lot of attention!” squeals Octavia.Haymitch has never mentioned his personal experience in the arena to me. I wouldnever ask. And if I ever saw his Games televised in reruns, I must’ve been tooyoung to remember it. But the Capitol won’t let him forget it this year. In away, it’s a good thing Peeta and I will both be available as mentors during theQuell, because it’s a sure bet that Haymitch will be wasted.After they’ve exhausted the topic of the Quarter Quell, my prep team launchesinto a whole lot of stuff about their incomprehensibly silly lives. Who saidwhat about someone I’ve never heard of and what sort of shoes they just boughtand a long story from Octavia about what a mistake it was to have everyone wearfeathers to her birthday party.Soon my brows are stinging, my hair’s smooth and silky, and my nails are readyto be painted. Apparently they’ve been given instruction to prepare only myhands and face, probably because everything else will be covered in the coldweather. Flavius badly wants to use his own trademark purple lipstick on me butresigns himself to a pink as they begin to color my face and nails. I can see bythe palette Cinna has assigned that we’re going for girlish, not sexy. Good.I’ll never convince anyone of anything if I’m trying to be provocative. Haymitchmade that very clear when he was coaching me for my interview for the Games.My mother comes in, somewhat shyly, and says that Cinna has asked her to showthe preps how she did my hair the day of the reaping. They respond withenthusiasm and then watch, thoroughly engrossed, as she breaks down the processof the elaborate braided hairdo. In the mirror, I can see their earnest facesfollowing her every move, their eagerness when it is their turn to try a step.In fact, all three are so readily respectful and nice to my mother that I feelbad about how I go around feeling so superior to them. Who knows who I would beor what I would talk about if I’d been raised in the Capitol? Maybe my biggestregret would be having feathered costumes at my birthday party, too.When my hair is done, I find Cinna downstairs in the living room, and just thesight of him makes me feel more hopeful. He looks the same as always, simpleclothes, short brown hair, just a hint of gold eyeliner. We embrace, and I canbarely keep from spilling out the entire episode with President Snow. But no,I’ve decided to tell Haymitch first. He’ll know best who to burden with it. It’sso easy to talk to Cinna, though. Lately we’ve been speaking a lot on thetelephone that came with the house. It’s sort of a joke, because almost no oneelse we know owns one. There’s Peeta, but obviously I don’t call him. Haymitchtore his out of the wall years ago. My friend Madge, the mayor’s daughter, has atelephone in her house, but if we want to talk, we do it in person. At first,the thing barely ever got used. Then Cinna started to call to work on my talent.Every victor is supposed to have one. Your talent is the activity you take upsince you don’t have to work either in school or your district’s industry. Itcan be anything, really, anything that they can interview you about. Peeta, itturns out, actually has a talent, which is painting. He’s been frosting thosecakes and cookies for years in his family’s bakery. But now that he’s rich, hecan afford to smear real paint on canvases. I don’t have a talent, unless youcount hunting illegally, which they don’t. Or maybe singing, which I wouldn’t dofor the Capitol in a million years. My mother tried to interest me in a varietyof suitable alternatives from a list Effie Trinket sent her. Cooking, flowerarranging, playing the flute. None of them took, although Prim had a knack forall three. Finally Cinna stepped in and offered to help me develop my passionfor designing clothes, which really required development since it wasnonexistent. But I said yes because it meant getting to talk to Cinna, and hepromised he’d do all the work.Now he’s arranging things around my living room: clothing, fabrics, andsketchbooks with designs he’s drawn. I pick up one of the sketchbooks andexamine a dress I supposedly created. “You know, I think I show a lot ofpromise,” I say.“Get dressed, you worthless thing,” he says, tossing a bundle of clothes at me.I may have no interest in designing clothes but I do love the ones Cinna makesfor me. Like these. Flowing black pants made of a thick, warm material. Acomfortable white shirt. A sweater woven from green and blue and gray strands ofkitten-soft wool. Laced leather boots that don’t pinch my toes.“Did I design my outfit?” I ask.“No, you aspire to design your outfit and be like me, your fashion hero,” saysCinna. He hands me a small stack of cards. “You’ll read these off camera whilethey’re filming the clothes. Try to sound like you care.”Just then, Effie Trinket arrives in a pumpkin orange wig to remind everyone,“We’re on a schedule!” She kisses me on both cheeks while waving in the cameracrew, then orders me into position. Effie’s the only reason we got anywhere ontime in the Capitol, so I try to accommodate her. I start bobbing around like apuppet, holding up outfits and saying meaningless things like “Don’t you loveit?” The sound team records me reading from my cards in a chirpy voice so theycan insert it later, then I’m tossed out of the room so they can film my/Cinna’sdesigns in peace.Prim got out early from school for the event. Now she stands in the kitchen,being interviewed by another crew. She looks lovely in a sky blue frock thatbrings out her eyes, her blond hair pulled back in a matching ribbon. She’sleaning a bit forward on the toes of her shiny white boots like she’s about totake flight, like —Bam! It’s like someone actually hits me in the chest. No one has, of course, butthe pain is so real I take a step back. I squeeze my eyes shut and I don’t seePrim — I see Rue, the twelve-year-old girl from District 11 who was my ally inthe arena. She could fly, birdlike, from tree to tree, catching on to theslenderest branches. Rue, who I didn’t save. Who I let die. I picture her lyingon the ground with the spear still wedged in her stomach. . . .Who else will I fail to save from the Capitol’s vengeance? Who else will be deadif I don’t satisfy President Snow?I realize Cinna’s trying to put a coat on me, so I raise my arms. I feel fur,inside and out, encasing me. It’s from no animal I’ve ever seen. “Ermine,” hetells me as I stroke the white sleeve. Leather gloves. A bright red scarf.Something furry covers my ears. “You’re bringing earmuffs back in style.”I hate earmuffs, I think. They make it hard to hear, and since I was blasteddeaf in one ear in the arena, I dislike them even more. After I won, the Capitolrepaired my ear, but I still find myself testing it.My mother hurries up with something cupped in her hand. “For good luck,” shesays.It’s the pin Madge gave me before I left for the Games. A mockingjay flying in acircle of gold. I tried to give it to Rue but she wouldn’t take it. She said thepin was the reason she’d decided to trust me. Cinna fixes it on the knot in thescarf.Effie Trinket’s nearby, clapping her hands. “Attention, everyone! We’re about todo the first outdoor shot, where the victors greet each other at the beginningof their marvelous trip. All right, Katniss, big smile, you’re very excited,right?” I don’t exaggerate when I say she shoves me out the door.For a moment I can’t quite see right because of the snow, which is now comingdown in earnest. Then I make out Peeta coming through his front door. In my headI hear President Snow’s directive, “Convince me.” And I know I must.My face breaks into a huge smile and I start walking in Peeta’s direction. Then,as if I can’t stand it another second, I start running. He catches me and spinsme around and then he slips — he still isn’t entirely in command of hisartificial leg — and we fall into the snow, me on top of him, and that’s wherewe have our first kiss in months. It’s full of fur and snowflakes and lipstick,but underneath all that, I can feel the steadiness that Peeta brings toeverything. And I know I’m not alone. As badly as I have hurt him, he won’texpose me in front of the cameras. Won’t condemn me with a halfhearted kiss.He’s still looking out for me. Just as he did in the arena. Somehow the thoughtmakes me want to cry. Instead I pull him to his feet, tuck my glove through thecrook of his arm, and merrily pull him on our way.The rest of the day is a blur of getting to the station, bidding everyonegood-bye, the train pulling out, the old team — Peeta and me, Effie andHaymitch, Cinna and Portia, Peeta’s stylist — dining on an indescribablydelicious meal I don’t remember. And then I’m swathed in pajamas and avoluminous robe, sitting in my plush compartment, waiting for the others to goto sleep. I know Haymitch will be up for hours. He doesn’t like to sleep whenit’s dark out.When the train seems quiet, I put on my slippers and pad down to his door. Ihave to knock several times before he answers, scowling, as if he’s certain I’vebrought bad news.“What do you want?” he says, nearly knocking me out with a cloud of wine fumes.“I have to talk to you,” I whisper.“Now?” he says. I nod. “This better be good.” He waits, but I feel certain everyword we utter on a Capitol train is being recorded. “Well?” he barks.The train starts to brake and for a second I think President Snow is watching meand doesn’t approve of my confiding in Haymitch and has decided to go ahead andkill me now. But we’re just stopping for fuel.“The train’s so stuffy,” I say.It’s a harmless phrase, but I see Haymitch’s eyes narrow in understanding. “Iknow what you need.” He pushes past me and lurches down the hall to a door. Whenhe wrestles it open, a blast of snow hits us. He trips out onto the ground.A Capitol attendant rushes to help, but Haymitch waves her away good-naturedlyas he staggers off. “Just want some fresh air. Only be a minute.”“Sorry. He’s drunk,” I say apologetically. “I’ll get him.” I hop down andstumble along the track behind him, soaking my slippers with snow, as he leadsme beyond the end of the train so we will not be overheard. Then he turns on me.“What?”I tell him everything. About the president’s visit, about Gale, about how we’reall going to die if I fail.His face sobers, grows older in the glow of the red taillights. “Then you can’tfail.”“If you could just help me get through this trip —” I begin.“No, Katniss, it’s not just this trip,” he says.“What do you mean?” I say.“Even if you pull it off, they’ll be back in another few months to take us allto the Games. You and Peeta, you’ll be mentors now, every year from here on out.And every year they’ll revisit the romance and broadcast the details of yourprivate life, and you’ll never, ever be able to do anything but live happilyever after with that boy.”The full impact of what he’s saying hits me. I will never have a life with Gale,even if I want to. I will never be allowed to live alone. I will have to beforever in love with Peeta. The Capitol will insist on it. I’ll have a few yearsmaybe, because I’m still only sixteen, to stay with my mother and Prim. And then. . . and then . . .“Do you understand what I mean?” he presses me.I nod. He means there’s only one future, if I want to keep those I love aliveand stay alive myself. I’ll have to marry Peeta."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00011.jpg]We slog back to the train in silence. In the hallway outside my door, Haymitchgives my shoulder a pat and says, “You could do a lot worse, you know.” He headsoff to his compartment, taking the smell of wine with him.In my room, I remove my sodden slippers, my wet robe and pajamas. There are morein the drawers but I just crawl between the covers of my bed in my underclothes.I stare into the darkness, thinking about my conversation with Haymitch.Everything he said was true about the Capitol’s expectations, my future withPeeta, even his last comment. Of course, I could do a lot worse than Peeta. Thatisn’t really the point, though, is it? One of the few freedoms we have inDistrict 12 is the right to marry who we want or not marry at all. And now eventhat has been taken away from me. I wonder if President Snow will insist we havechildren. If we do, they’ll have to face the reaping each year. And wouldn’t itbe something to see the child of not one but two victors chosen for the arena?Victors’ children have been in the ring before. It always causes a lot ofexcitement and generates talk about how the odds are not in that family’s favor.But it happens too frequently to just be about odds. Gale’s convinced theCapitol does it on purpose, rigs the drawings to add extra drama. Given all thetrouble I’ve caused, I’ve probably guaranteed any child of mine a spot in theGames.I think of Haymitch, unmarried, no family, blotting out the world with drink. Hecould have had his choice of any woman in the district. And he chose solitude.Not solitude — that sounds too peaceful. More like solitary confinement. Was itbecause, having been in the arena, he knew it was better than risking thealternative? I had a taste of that alternative when they called Prim’s name onreaping day and I watched her walk to the stage to her death. But as her sisterI could take her place, an option forbidden to our mother.My mind searches frantically for a way out. I can’t let President Snow condemnme to this. Even if it means taking my own life. Before that, though, I’d try torun away. What would they do if I simply vanished? Disappeared into the woodsand never came out? Could I even manage to take everyone I love with me, start anew life deep in the wild? Highly unlikely but not impossible.I shake my head to clear it. This is not the time to be making wild escapeplans. I must focus on the Victory Tour. Too many people’s fates depend on mygiving a good show.Dawn comes before sleep does, and there’s Effie rapping on my door. I pull onwhatever clothes are at the top of the drawer and drag myself down to the diningcar. I don’t see what difference it makes when I get up, since this is a travelday, but then it turns out that yesterday’s makeover was just to get me to thetrain station. Today I’ll get the works from my prep team.“Why? It’s too cold for anything to show,” I grumble.“Not in District Eleven,” says Effie.District 11. Our first stop. I’d rather start in any other district, since thiswas Rue’s home. But that’s not how the Victory Tour works. Usually it kicks offin 12 and then goes in descending district order to 1, followed by the Capitol.The victor’s district is skipped and saved for very last. Since 12 puts on theleast fabulous celebration — usually just a dinner for the tributes and avictory rally in the square, where nobody looks like they’re having any fun —it’s probably best to get us out of the way as soon as possible. This year, forthe first time since Haymitch won, the final stop on the tour will be 12, andthe Capitol will spring for the festivities.I try to enjoy the food like Hazelle said. The kitchen staff clearly wants toplease me. They’ve prepared my favorite, lamb stew with dried plums, among otherdelicacies. Orange juice and a pot of steaming hot chocolate wait at my place atthe table. So I eat a lot, and the meal is beyond reproach, but I can’t say I’menjoying it. I’m also annoyed that no one but Effie and I has shown up.“Where’s everybody else?” I ask.“Oh, who knows where Haymitch is,” says Effie. I didn’t really expect Haymitch,because he’s probably just getting to bed. “Cinna was up late working onorganizing your garment car. He must have over a hundred outfits for you. Yourevening clothes are exquisite. And Peeta’s team is probably still asleep.”“Doesn’t he need prepping?” I ask.“Not the way you do,” Effie replies.What does this mean? It means I get to spend the morning having the hair rippedoff my body while Peeta sleeps in. I hadn’t thought about it much, but in thearena at least some of the boys got to keep their body hair whereas none of thegirls did. I can remember Peeta’s now, as I bathed him by the stream. Very blondin the sunlight, once the mud and blood had been washed away. Only his faceremained completely smooth. Not one of the boys grew a beard, and many were oldenough to. I wonder what they did to them.If I feel ragged, my prep team seems in worse condition, knocking back coffeeand sharing brightly colored little pills. As far as I can tell, they never getup before noon unless there’s some sort of national emergency, like my leg hair.I was so happy when it grew back in, too. As if it were a sign that things mightbe returning to normal. I run my fingers along the soft, curly down on my legsand give myself over to the team. None of them are up to their usual chatter, soI can hear every strand being yanked from its follicle. I have to soak in a tubfull of a thick, unpleasant-smelling solution, while my face and hair areplastered with creams. Two more baths follow in other, less offensive,concoctions. I’m plucked and scoured and massaged and anointed until I’m raw.Flavius tilts up my chin and sighs. “It’s a shame Cinna said no alterations onyou.”“Yes, we could really make you something special,” says Octavia.“When she’s older,” says Venia almost grimly. “Then he’ll have to let us.”Do what? Blow my lips up like President Snow’s? Tattoo my breasts? Dye my skinmagenta and implant gems in it? Cut decorative patterns in my face? Give mecurved talons? Or cat’s whiskers? I saw all these things and more on the peoplein the Capitol. Do they really have no idea how freakish they look to the restof us?The thought of being left to my prep team’s fashion whims only adds to themiseries competing for my attention — my abused body, my lack of sleep, mymandatory marriage, and the terror of being unable to satisfy President Snow’sdemands. By the time I reach lunch, where Effie, Cinna, Portia, Haymitch, andPeeta have started without me, I’m too weighed down to talk. They’re ravingabout the food and how well they sleep on trains. Everyone’s all full ofexcitement about the tour. Well, everyone but Haymitch. He’s nursing a hangoverand picking at a muffin. I’m not really hungry, either, maybe because I loadedup on too much rich stuff this morning or maybe because I’m so unhappy. I playaround with a bowl of broth, eating only a spoonful or two. I can’t even look atPeeta — my designated future husband — although I know none of this is hisfault.People notice, try to bring me into the conversation, but I just brush them off.At some point, the train stops. Our server reports it will not just be for afuel stop — some part has malfunctioned and must be replaced. It will require atleast an hour. This sends Effie into a state. She pulls out her schedule andbegins to work out how the delay will impact every event for the rest of ourlives. Finally I just can’t stand to listen to her anymore.“No one cares, Effie!” I snap. Everyone at the table stares at me, evenHaymitch, who you’d think would be on my side in this matter since Effie driveshim nuts. I’m immediately put on the defensive. “Well, no one does!” I say, andget up and leave the dining car.The train suddenly seems stifling and I’m definitely queasy now. I find the exitdoor, force it open — triggering some sort of alarm, which I ignore — and jumpto the ground, expecting to land in snow. But the air’s warm and balmy againstmy skin. The trees still wear green leaves. How far south have we come in a day?I walk along the track, squinting against the bright sunlight, alreadyregretting my words to Effie. She’s hardly to blame for my current predicament.I should go back and apologize. My outburst was the height of bad manners, andmanners matter deeply to her. But my feet continue on along the track, past theend of the train, leaving it behind. An hour’s delay. I can walk at least twentyminutes in one direction and make it back with plenty of time to spare. Instead,after a couple hundred yards, I sink to the ground and sit there, looking intothe distance. If I had a bow and arrows, would I just keep going?After a while I hear footsteps behind me. It’ll be Haymitch, coming to chew meout. It’s not like I don’t deserve it, but I still don’t want to hear it. “I’mnot in the mood for a lecture,” I warn the clump of weeds by my shoes.“I’ll try to keep it brief.” Peeta takes a seat beside me.“I thought you were Haymitch,” I say.“No, he’s still working on that muffin.” I watch as Peeta positions hisartificial leg. “Bad day, huh?”“It’s nothing,” I say.He takes a deep breath. “Look, Katniss, I’ve been wanting to talk to you aboutthe way I acted on the train. I mean, the last train. The one that brought ushome. I knew you had something with Gale. I was jealous of him before I evenofficially met you. And it wasn’t fair to hold you to anything that happened inthe Games. I’m sorry.”His apology takes me by surprise. It’s true that Peeta froze me out after Iconfessed that my love for him during the Games was something of an act. But Idon’t hold that against him. In the arena, I’d played that romance angle for allit was worth. There had been times when I didn’t honestly know how I felt abouthim. I still don’t, really.“I’m sorry, too,” I say. I’m not sure for what exactly. Maybe because there’s areal chance I’m about to destroy him.“There’s nothing for you to be sorry about. You were just keeping us alive. ButI don’t want us to go on like this, ignoring each other in real life and fallinginto the snow every time there’s a camera around. So I thought if I stoppedbeing so, you know, wounded, we could take a shot at just being friends,” hesays.All my friends are probably going to end up dead, but refusing Peeta wouldn’tkeep him safe. “Okay,” I say. His offer does make me feel better. Lessduplicitous somehow. It would be nice if he’d come to me with this earlier,before I knew that President Snow had other plans and just being friends was notan option for us anymore. But either way, I’m glad we’re speaking again.“So what’s wrong?” he asks.I can’t tell him. I pick at the clump of weeds.“Let’s start with something more basic. Isn’t it strange that I know you’d riskyour life to save mine . . . but I don’t know what your favorite color is?” hesays.A smile creeps onto my lips. “Green. What’s yours?”“Orange,” he says.“Orange? Like Effie’s hair?” I say.“A bit more muted,” he says. “More like . . . sunset.”Sunset. I can see it immediately, the rim of the descending sun, the skystreaked with soft shades of orange. Beautiful. I remember the tiger lily cookieand, now that Peeta is talking to me again, it’s all I can do not to recount thewhole story about President Snow. But I know Haymitch wouldn’t want me to. I’dbetter stick to small talk.“You know, everyone’s always raving about your paintings. I feel bad I haven’tseen them,” I say.“Well, I’ve got a whole train car full.” He rises and offers me his hand. “Comeon.”It’s good to feel his fingers entwined with mine again, not for show but inactual friendship. We walk back to the train hand in hand. At the door, Iremember. “I’ve got to apologize to Effie first.”“Don’t be afraid to lay it on thick,” Peeta tells me.So when we go back to the dining car, where the others are still at lunch, Igive Effie an apology that I think is overkill but in her mind probably justmanages to compensate for my breach of etiquette. To her credit, Effie acceptsgra-ciously. She says it’s clear I’m under a lot of pressure. And her commentsabout the necessity of someone attending to the schedule only last about fiveminutes. Really, I’ve gotten off easily.When Effie finishes, Peeta leads me down a few cars to see his paintings. Idon’t know what I expected. Larger versions of the flower cookies maybe. Butthis is something entirely different. Peeta has painted the Games.Some you wouldn’t get right away, if you hadn’t been with him in the arenayourself. Water dripping through the cracks in our cave. The dry pond bed. Apair of hands, his own, digging for roots. Others any viewer would recognize.The golden horn called the Cornucopia. Clove arranging the knives inside herjacket. One of the mutts, unmistakably the blond, green-eyed one meant to beGlimmer, snarling as it makes its way toward us. And me. I am everywhere. Highup in a tree. Beating a shirt against the stones in the stream. Lyingunconscious in a pool of blood. And one I can’t place — perhaps this is how Ilooked when his fever was high — emerging from a silver gray mist that matchesmy eyes exactly.“What do you think?” he asks.“I hate them,” I say. I can almost smell the blood, the dirt, the unnaturalbreath of the mutt. “All I do is go around trying to forget the arena and you’vebrought it back to life. How do you remember these things so exactly?”“I see them every night,” he says.I know what he means. Nightmares — which I was no stranger to before the Games —now plague me whenever I sleep. But the old standby, the one of my father beingblown to bits in the mines, is rare. Instead I relive versions of what happenedin the arena. My worthless attempt to save Rue. Peeta bleeding to death.Glimmer’s bloated body disintegrating in my hands. Cato’s horrific end with themuttations. These are the most frequent visitors. “Me, too. Does it help? Topaint them out?”“I don’t know. I think I’m a little less afraid of going to sleep at night, or Itell myself I am,” he says. “But they haven’t gone anywhere.”“Maybe they won’t. Haymitch’s haven’t.” Haymitch doesn’t say so, but I’m surethis is why he doesn’t like to sleep in the dark.“No. But for me, it’s better to wake up with a paintbrush than a knife in myhand,” he says. “So you really hate them?”“Yes. But they’re extraordinary. Really,” I say. And they are. But I don’t wantto look at them anymore. “Want to see my talent? Cinna did a great job on it.”Peeta laughs. “Later.” The train lurches forward, and I can see the land movingpast us through the window. “Come on, we’re almost to District Eleven. Let’s gotake a look at it.”We go down to the last car on the train. There are chairs and couches to sit on,but what’s wonderful is that the back windows retract into the ceiling so you’reriding outside, in the fresh air, and you can see a wide sweep of the landscape.Huge open fields with herds of dairy cattle grazing in them. So unlike our ownheavily wooded home. We slow slightly and I think we might be coming in foranother stop, when a fence rises up before us. Towering at least thirty-fivefeet in the air and topped with wicked coils of barbed wire, it makes ours backin District 12 look childish. My eyes quickly inspect the base, which is linedwith enormous metal plates. There would be no burrowing under those, no escapingto hunt. Then I see the watchtowers, placed evenly apart, manned with armedguards, so out of place among the fields of wildflowers around them.“That’s something different,” says Peeta.Rue did give me the impression that the rules in District 11 were more harshlyenforced. But I never imagined something like this.Now the crops begin, stretched out as far as the eye can see. Men, women, andchildren wearing straw hats to keep off the sun straighten up, turn our way,take a moment to stretch their backs as they watch our train go by. I can seeorchards in the distance, and I wonder if that’s where Rue would have worked,collecting the fruit from the slimmest branches at the tops of the trees. Smallcommunities of shacks — by comparison the houses in the Seam are upscale —spring up here and there, but they’re all deserted. Every hand must be neededfor the harvest.On and on it goes. I can’t believe the size of District 11. “How many people doyou think live here?” Peeta asks. I shake my head. In school they refer to it asa large district, that’s all. No actual figures on the population. But thosekids we see on camera waiting for the reaping each year, they can’t be but asampling of the ones who actually live here. What do they do? Have preliminarydrawings? Pick the winners ahead of time and make sure they’re in the crowd? Howexactly did Rue end up on that stage with nothing but the wind offering to takeher place?I begin to weary of the vastness, the endlessness of this place. When Effiecomes to tell us to dress, I don’t object. I go to my compartment and let theprep team do my hair and makeup. Cinna comes in with a pretty orange frockpatterned with autumn leaves. I think how much Peeta will like the color.Effie gets Peeta and me together and goes through the day’s program one lasttime. In some districts the victors ride through the city while the residentscheer. But in 11 — maybe because there’s not much of a city to begin with,things being so spread out, or maybe because they don’t want to waste so manypeople while the harvest is on — the public appearance is confined to thesquare. It takes place before their Justice Building, a huge marble structure.Once, it must have been a thing of beauty, but time has taken its toll. Even ontelevision you can see ivy overtaking the crumbling facade, the sag of the roof.The square itself is ringed with run-down storefronts, most of which areabandoned. Wherever the well-to-do live in District 11, it’s not here.Our entire public performance will be staged outside on what Effie refers to asthe verandah, the tiled expanse between the front doors and the stairs that’sshaded by a roof supported by columns. Peeta and I will be introduced, the mayorof 11 will read a speech in our honor, and we’ll respond with a scriptedthank-you provided by the Capitol. If a victor had any special allies among thedead tributes, it is considered good form to add a few personal comments aswell. I should say something about Rue, and Thresh, too, really, but every timeI tried to write it at home, I ended up with a blank paper staring me in theface. It’s hard for me to talk about them without getting emotional.Fortunately, Peeta has a little something worked up, and with some slightalterations, it can count for both of us. At the end of the ceremony, we’ll bepresented with some sort of plaque, and then we can withdraw to the JusticeBuilding, where a special dinner will be served.As the train is pulling into the District 11 station, Cinna puts the finishingtouches on my outfit, switching my orange hairband for one of metallic gold andsecuring the mockingjay pin I wore in the arena to my dress. There’s nowelcoming committee on the platform, just a squad of eight Peacekeepers whodirect us into the back of an armored truck. Effie sniffs as the door clanksclosed behind us. “Really, you’d think we were all criminals,” she says.Not all of us, Effie. Just me, I think.The truck lets us out at the back of the Justice Building. We’re hurried inside.I can smell an excellent meal being prepared, but it doesn’t block out the odorsof mildew and rot. They’ve left us no time to look around. As we make a beelinefor the front entrance, I can hear the anthem beginning outside in the square.Someone clips a microphone on me. Peeta takes my left hand. The mayor’sintroducing us as the massive doors open with a groan.“Big smiles!” Effie says, and gives us a nudge. Our feet start moving forward.This is it. This is where I have to convince everybody how in love I am withPeeta, I think. The solemn ceremony is pretty tightly mapped out, so I’m notsure how to do it. It’s not a time for kissing, but maybe I can work one in.There’s loud applause, but none of the other responses we got in the Capitol,the cheers and whoops and whistles. We walk across the shaded verandah until theroof runs out and we’re standing at the top of a big flight of marble stairs inthe glaring sun. As my eyes adjust, I see the buildings on the square have beenhung with banners that help cover up their neglected state. It’s packed withpeople, but again, just a fraction of the number who live here.As usual, a special platform has been constructed at the bottom of the stage forthe families of the dead tributes. On Thresh’s side, there’s only an old womanwith a hunched back and a tall, muscular girl I’m guessing is his sister. OnRue’s . . . I’m not prepared for Rue’s family. Her parents, whose faces arestill fresh with sorrow. Her five younger siblings, who resemble her so closely.The slight builds, the luminous brown eyes. They form a flock of small darkbirds.The applause dies out and the mayor gives the speech in our honor. Two littlegirls come up with tremendous bouquets of flowers. Peeta does his part of thescripted reply and then I find my lips moving to conclude it. Fortunately mymother and Prim have drilled me so I can do it in my sleep.Peeta had his personal comments written on a card, but he doesn’t pull it out.Instead he speaks in his simple, winning style about Thresh and Rue making it tothe final eight, about how they both kept me alive — thereby keeping him alive —and about how this is a debt we can never repay. And then he hesitates beforeadding something that wasn’t written on the card. Maybe because he thought Effiemight make him remove it. “It can in no way replace your losses, but as a tokenof our thanks we’d like for each of the tributes’ families from District Elevento receive one month of our winnings every year for the duration of our lives.”The crowd can’t help but respond with gasps and murmurs. There is no precedentfor what Peeta has done. I don’t even know if it’s legal. He probably doesn’tknow, either, so he didn’t ask in case it isn’t. As for the families, they juststare at us in shock. Their lives were changed forever when Thresh and Rue werelost, but this gift will change them again. A month of tribute winnings caneasily provide for a family for a year. As long as we live, they will nothunger.I look at Peeta and he gives me a sad smile. I hear Haymitch’s voice. “You coulddo a lot worse.” At this moment, it’s impossible to imagine how I could do anybetter. The gift . . . it is perfect. So when I rise up on tiptoe to kiss him,it doesn’t seem forced at all.The mayor steps forward and presents us each with a plaque that’s so large Ihave to put down my bouquet to hold it. The ceremony’s about to end when Inotice one of Rue’s sisters staring at me. She must be about nine and is almostan exact replica of Rue, down to the way she stands with her arms slightlyextended. Despite the good news about the winnings, she’s not happy. In fact,her look is reproachful. Is it because I didn’t save Rue?No. It’s because I still haven’t thanked her, I think.A wave of shame rushes through me. The girl is right. How can I stand here,passive and mute, leaving all the words to Peeta? If she had won, Rue wouldnever have let my death go unsung. I remember how I took care in the arena tocover her with flowers, to make sure her loss did not go unnoticed. But thatgesture will mean nothing if I don’t support it now.“Wait!” I stumble forward, pressing the plaque to my chest. My allotted time forspeaking has come and gone, but I must say something. I owe too much. And evenif I had pledged all my winnings to the families, it would not excuse my silencetoday. “Wait, please.” I don’t know how to start, but once I do, the words rushfrom my lips as if they’ve been forming in the back of my mind for a long time.“I want to give my thanks to the tributes of District Eleven,” I say. I look atthe pair of women on Thresh’s side. “I only ever spoke to Thresh one time. Justlong enough for him to spare my life. I didn’t know him, but I always respectedhim. For his power. For his refusal to play the Games on anyone’s terms but hisown. The Careers wanted him to team up with them from the beginning, but hewouldn’t do it. I respected him for that.”For the first time the old hunched woman — is she Thresh’s grandmother? — raisesher head and the trace of a smile plays on her lips.The crowd has fallen silent now, so silent that I wonder how they manage it.They must all be holding their breath.I turn to Rue’s family. “But I feel as if I did know Rue, and she’ll always bewith me. Everything beautiful brings her to mind. I see her in the yellowflowers that grow in the Meadow by my house. I see her in the mockingjays thatsing in the trees. But most of all, I see her in my sister, Prim.” My voice isundependable, but I am almost finished. “Thank you for your children.” I raisemy chin to address the crowd. “And thank you all for the bread.”I stand there, feeling broken and small, thousands of eyes trained on me.There’s a long pause. Then, from somewhere in the crowd, someone whistles Rue’sfour-note mockingjay tune. The one that signaled the end of the workday in theorchards. The one that meant safety in the arena. By the end of the tune, I havefound the whistler, a wizened old man in a faded red shirt and overalls. Hiseyes meet mine.What happens next is not an accident. It is too well executed to be spontaneous,because it happens in complete unison. Every person in the crowd presses thethree middle fingers of their left hand against their lips and extends them tome. It’s our sign from District 12, the last good-bye I gave Rue in the arena.If I hadn’t spoken to President Snow, this gesture might move me to tears. Butwith his recent orders to calm the districts fresh in my ears, it fills me withdread. What will he think of this very public salute to the girl who defied theCapitol?The full impact of what I’ve done hits me. It was not intentional — I only meantto express my thanks — but I have elicited something dangerous. An act ofdissent from the people of District 11. This is exactly the kind of thing I amsupposed to be defusing!I try to think of something to say to undermine what has just happened, tonegate it, but I can hear the slight burst of static indicating my microphonehas been cut off and the mayor has taken over. Peeta and I acknowledge a finalround of applause. He leads me back toward the doors, unaware that anything hasgone wrong.I feel funny and have to stop for a moment. Little bits of bright sunshine dancebefore my eyes. “Are you all right?” Peeta asks.“Just dizzy. The sun was so bright,” I say. I see his bouquet. “I forgot myflowers,” I mumble.“I’ll get them,” he says.“I can,” I answer.We would be safe inside the Justice Building by now, if I hadn’t stopped, if Ihadn’t left my flowers. Instead, from the deep shade of the verandah, we see thewhole thing.A pair of Peacekeepers dragging the old man who whistled to the top of thesteps. Forcing him to his knees before the crowd. And putting a bullet throughhis head."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00012.jpg]The man has only just crumpled to the ground when a wall of white Peacekeeperuniforms blocks our view. Several of the soldiers have automatic weapons heldlengthwise as they push us back toward the door.“We’re going!” says Peeta, shoving the Peacekeeper who’s pressing on me. “We getit, all right? Come on, Katniss.” His arm encircles me and guides me back intothe Justice Building. The Peacekeepers follow a pace or two behind us. Themoment we’re inside, the doors slam shut and we hear the Peacekeepers’ bootsmoving back toward the crowd.Haymitch, Effie, Portia, and Cinna wait under a static-filled screen that’smounted on the wall, their faces tight with anxiety.“What happened?” Effie hurries over. “We lost the feed just after Katniss’sbeautiful speech, and then Haymitch said he thought he heard a gun fire, and Isaid it was ridiculous, but who knows? There are lunatics everywhere!”“Nothing happened, Effie. An old truck backfired,” says Peeta evenly.Two more shots. The door doesn’t muffle their sound much. Who was that? Thresh’sgrandmother? One of Rue’s little sisters?“Both of you. With me,” says Haymitch. Peeta and I follow him, leaving theothers behind. The Peacekeepers who are stationed around the Justice Buildingtake little interest in our movements now that we are safely inside. We ascend amagnificent curved marble staircase. At the top, there’s a long hall with worncarpet on the floor. Double doors stand open, welcoming us into the first roomwe encounter. The ceiling must be twenty feet high. Designs of fruit and flowersare carved into the molding and small, fat children with wings look down at usfrom every angle. Vases of blossoms give off a cloying scent that makes my eyesitch. Our evening clothes hang on racks against the wall. This room has beenprepared for our use, but we’re barely there long enough to drop off our gifts.Then Haymitch yanks the microphones from our chests, stuffs them beneath a couchcushion, and waves us on.As far as I know, Haymitch has only been here once, when he was on his VictoryTour decades ago. But he must have a remarkable memory or reliable instincts,because he leads us up through a maze of twisting staircases and increasinglynarrow halls. At times he has to stop and force a door. By the protesting squeakof the hinges you can tell it’s been a long time since it was opened. Eventuallywe climb a ladder to a trapdoor. When Haymitch pushes it aside, we findourselves in the dome of the Justice Building. It’s a huge place filled withbroken furniture, piles of books and ledgers, and rusty weapons. The coat ofdust blanketing everything is so thick it’s clear it hasn’t been disturbed foryears. Light struggles to filter in through four grimy square windows set in thesides of the dome. Haymitch kicks the trapdoor shut and turns on us.“What happened?” he asks.Peeta relates all that occurred in the square. The whistle, the salute, ourhesitation on the verandah, the murder of the old man. “What’s going on,Haymitch?”“It will be better coming from you,” Haymitch says to me.I don’t agree. I think it will be a hundred times worse coming from me. But Itell Peeta everything as calmly as I can. About President Snow, the unrest inthe districts. I don’t even omit the kiss with Gale. I lay out how we are all injeopardy, how the whole country is in jeopardy because of my trick with theberries. “I was supposed to fix things on this tour. Make everyone who haddoubted believe I acted out of love. Calm things down. But obviously, all I’vedone today is get three people killed, and now everyone in the square will bepunished.” I feel so sick that I have to sit down on a couch, despite theexposed springs and stuffing.“Then I made things worse, too. By giving the money,” says Peeta. Suddenly hestrikes out at a lamp that sits precariously on a crate and knocks it across theroom, where it shatters against the floor. “This has to stop. Right now. This —this — game you two play, where you tell each other secrets but keep them fromme like I’m too inconsequential or stupid or weak to handle them.”“It’s not like that, Peeta —” I begin.“It’s exactly like that!” he yells at me. “I have people I care about, too,Katniss! Family and friends back in District Twelve who will be just as dead asyours if we don’t pull this thing off. So, after all we went through in thearena, don’t I even rate the truth from you?”“You’re always so reliably good, Peeta,” says Haymitch. “So smart about how youpresent yourself before the cameras. I didn’t want to disrupt that.”“Well, you overestimated me. Because I really screwed up today. What do youthink is going to happen to Rue’s and Thresh’s families? Do you think they’llget their share of our winnings? Do you think I gave them a bright future?Because I think they’ll be lucky if they survive the day!” Peeta sends somethingelse flying, a statue. I’ve never seen him like this.“He’s right, Haymitch,” I say. “We were wrong not to tell him. Even back in theCapitol.”“Even in the arena, you two had some sort of system worked out, didn’t you?”asks Peeta. His voice is quieter now. “Something I wasn’t part of.”“No. Not officially. I just could tell what Haymitch wanted me to do by what hesent, or didn’t send,” I say.“Well, I never had that opportunity. Because he never sent me anything until youshowed up,” says Peeta.I haven’t thought much about this. How it must have looked from Peeta’sperspective when I appeared in the arena having received burn medicine and breadwhen he, who was at death’s door, had gotten nothing. Like Haymitch was keepingme alive at his expense.“Look, boy —” Haymitch begins.“Don’t bother, Haymitch. I know you had to choose one of us. And I’d have wantedit to be her. But this is something different. People are dead out there. Morewill follow unless we’re very good. We all know I’m better than Katniss in frontof the cameras. No one needs to coach me on what to say. But I have to know whatI’m walking into,” says Peeta.“From now on, you’ll be fully informed,” Haymitch promises.“I better be,” says Peeta. He doesn’t even bother to look at me before heleaves.The dust he disrupted billows up and looks for new places to land. My hair, myeyes, my shiny gold pin.“Did you choose me, Haymitch?” I ask.“Yeah,” he says.“Why? You like him better,” I say.“That’s true. But remember, until they changed the rules, I could only hope toget one of you out of there alive,” he says. “I thought since he was determinedto protect you, well, between the three of us, we might be able to bring youhome.”“Oh” is all I can think to say.“You’ll see, the choices you’ll have to make. If we survive this,” saysHaymitch. “You’ll learn.”Well, I’ve learned one thing today. This place is not a larger version ofDistrict 12. Our fence is unguarded and rarely charged. Our Peacekeepers areunwelcome but less brutal. Our hardships evoke more fatigue than fury. Here in11, they suffer more acutely and feel more desperation. President Snow is right.A spark could be enough to set them ablaze.Everything is happening too fast for me to process it. The warning, theshootings, the recognition that I may have set something of great consequence inmotion. The whole thing is so improbable. And it would be one thing if I hadplanned to stir things up, but given the circumstances . . . how on earth did Icause so much trouble?“Come on. We’ve got a dinner to attend,” says Haymitch.I stand in the shower as long as they let me before I have to come out to bereadied. The prep team seems oblivious to the events of the day. They’re allexcited about the dinner. In the districts they’re important enough to attend,whereas back in the Capitol they almost never score invitations to prestigiousparties. While they try to predict what dishes will be served, I keep seeing theold man’s head being blown off. I don’t even pay attention to what anyone isdoing to me until I’m about to leave and I see myself in the mirror. A pale pinkstrapless dress brushes my shoes. My hair is pinned back from my face andfalling down my back in a shower of ringlets.Cinna comes up behind me and arranges a shimmering silver wrap around myshoulders. He catches my eye in the mirror. “Like it?”“It’s beautiful. As always,” I say.“Let’s see how it looks with a smile,” he says gently. It’s his reminder that ina minute, there will be cameras again. I manage to raise the corners of my lips.“There we go.”When we all assemble to go down to the dinner, I can see Effie is out of sorts.Surely, Haymitch hasn’t told her about what happened in the square. I wouldn’tbe surprised if Cinna and Portia know, but there seems to be an unspokenagreement to leave Effie out of the bad-news loop. It doesn’t take long to hearabout the problem, though.Effie runs through the evening’s schedule, then tosses it aside. “And then,thank goodness, we can all get on that train and get out of here,” she says.“Is something wrong, Effie?” asks Cinna.“I don’t like the way we’ve been treated. Being stuffed into trucks and barredfrom the platform. And then, about an hour ago, I decided to look around theJustice Building. I’m something of an expert in architectural design, you know,”she says.“Oh, yes, I’ve heard that,” says Portia before the pause gets too long.“So, I was just having a peek around because district ruins are going to be allthe rage this year, when two Peacemakers showed up and ordered me back to ourquarters. One of them actually poked me with her gun!” says Effie.I can’t help thinking this is the direct result of Haymitch, Peeta, and medisappearing earlier in the day. It’s a little reassuring, actually, to thinkthat Haymitch might have been right. That no one would have been monitoring thedusty dome where we talked. Although I bet they are now.Effie looks so distressed that I spontaneously give her a hug. “That’s awful,Effie. Maybe we shouldn’t go to the dinner at all. At least until they’veapologized.” I know she’ll never agree to this, but she brightens considerablyat the suggestion, at the validation of her complaint.“No, I’ll manage. It’s part of my job to weather the ups and downs. And we can’tlet you two miss your dinner,” she says. “But thank you for the offer, Katniss.”Effie arranges us in formation for our entrance. First the prep teams, then her,the stylists, Haymitch. Peeta and I, of course, bring up the rear.Somewhere below, musicians begin to play. As the first wave of our littleprocession begins down the steps, Peeta and I join hands.“Haymitch says I was wrong to yell at you. You were only operating under hisinstructions,” says Peeta. “And it isn’t as if I haven’t kept things from you inthe past.”I remember the shock of hearing Peeta confess his love for me in front of all ofPanem. Haymitch had known about that and not told me. “I think I broke a fewthings myself after that interview.”“Just an urn,” he says.“And your hands. There’s no point to it anymore, though, is there? Not beingstraight with each other?” I say.“No point,” says Peeta. We stand at the top of the stairs, giving Haymitch afifteen-step lead as Effie directed. “Was that really the only time you kissedGale?”I’m so startled I answer. “Yes.” With all that has happened today, has thatquestion actually been preying on him?“That’s fifteen. Let’s do it,” he says.A light hits us, and I put on the most dazzling smile I can.We descend the steps and are sucked into what becomes an indistinguishable roundof dinners, ceremonies, and train rides. Each day it’s the same. Wake up. Getdressed. Ride through cheering crowds. Listen to a speech in our honor. Give athank-you speech in return, but only the one the Capitol gave us, never anypersonal additions now. Sometimes a brief tour: a glimpse of the sea in onedistrict, towering forests in another, ugly factories, fields of wheat, stinkingrefineries. Dress in evening clothes. Attend dinner. Train.During ceremonies, we are solemn and respectful but always linked together, byour hands, our arms. At dinners, we are borderline delirious in our love foreach other. We kiss, we dance, we get caught trying to sneak away to be alone.On the train, we are quietly miserable as we try to assess what effect we mightbe having.Even without our personal speeches to trigger dissent — needless to say the oneswe gave in District 11 were edited out before the event was broadcast — you canfeel something in the air, the rolling boil of a pot about to run over. Noteverywhere. Some crowds have the weary-cattle feel that I know District 12usually projects at the victors’ ceremonies. But in others — particularly 8, 4,and 3 — there is genuine elation in the faces of the people at the sight of us,and under the elation, fury. When they chant my name, it is more of a cry forvengeance than a cheer. When the Peacekeepers move in to quiet an unruly crowd,it presses back instead of retreating. And I know that there’s nothing I couldever do to change this. No show of love, however believable, will turn thistide. If my holding out those berries was an act of temporary insanity, thenthese people will embrace insanity, too.Cinna begins to take in my clothes around the waist. The prep team frets overthe circles under my eyes. Effie starts giving me pills to sleep, but they don’twork. Not well enough. I drift off only to be roused by nightmares that haveincreased in number and intensity. Peeta, who spends much of the night roamingthe train, hears me screaming as I struggle to break out of the haze of drugsthat merely prolong the horrible dreams. He manages to wake me and calm me down.Then he climbs into bed to hold me until I fall back to sleep. After that, Irefuse the pills. But every night I let him into my bed. We manage the darknessas we did in the arena, wrapped in each other’s arms, guarding against dangersthat can descend at any moment. Nothing else happens, but our arrangementquickly becomes a subject of gossip on the train.When Effie brings it up to me, I think, Good. Maybe it will get back toPresident Snow. I tell her we’ll make an effort to be more discreet, but wedon’t.The back-to-back appearances in 2 and 1 are their own special kind of awful.Cato and Clove, the tributes from District 2, might have both made it home ifPeeta and I hadn’t. I personally killed the girl, Glimmer, and the boy fromDistrict 1. As I try to avoid looking at his family, I learn that his name wasMarvel. How did I never know that? I suppose that before the Games I didn’t payattention, and afterward I didn’t want to know.By the time we reach the Capitol, we are desperate. We make endless appearancesto adoring crowds. There is no danger of an uprising here among the privileged,among those whose names are never placed in the reaping balls, whose childrennever die for the supposed crimes committed generations ago. We don’t need toconvince anybody in the Capitol of our love but hold to the slim hope that wecan still reach some of those we failed to convince in the districts. Whateverwe do seems too little, too late.Back in our old quarters in the Training Center, I’m the one who suggests thepublic marriage proposal. Peeta agrees to do it but then disappears to his roomfor a long time. Haymitch tells me to leave him alone.“I thought he wanted it, anyway,” I say.“Not like this,” Haymitch says. “He wanted it to be real.”I go back to my room and lie under the covers, trying not to think of Gale andthinking of nothing else.That night, on the stage before the Training Center, we bubble our way through alist of questions. Caesar Flickerman, in his twinkling midnight blue suit, hishair, eyelids, and lips still dyed powder blue, flawlessly guides us through theinterview. When he asks us about the future, Peeta gets down on one knee, poursout his heart, and begs me to marry him. I, of course, accept. Caesar is besidehimself, the Capitol audience is hysterical, shots of crowds around Panem show acountry besotted with happiness.President Snow himself makes a surprise visit to congratulate us. He claspsPeeta’s hand and gives him an approving slap on the shoulder. He embraces me,enfolding me in the smell of blood and roses, and plants a puffy kiss on mycheek. When he pulls back, his fingers digging into my arms, his face smilinginto mine, I dare to raise my eyebrows. They ask what my lips can’t. Did I doit? Was it enough? Was giving everything over to you, keeping up the game,promising to marry Peeta enough?In answer, he gives an almost imperceptible shake of his head."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00015.jpg]In that one slight motion, I see the end of hope, the beginning of thedestruction of everything I hold dear in the world. I can’t guess what form mypunishment will take, how wide the net will be cast, but when it is finished,there will most likely be nothing left. So you would think that at this moment,I would be in utter despair. Here’s what’s strange. The main thing I feel is asense of relief. That I can give up this game. That the question of whether Ican succeed in this venture has been answered, even if that answer is aresounding no. That if desperate times call for desperate measures, then I amfree to act as desperately as I wish.Only not here, not quite yet. It’s essential to get back to District 12, becausethe main part of any plan will include my mother and sister, Gale and hisfamily. And Peeta, if I can get him to come with us. I add Haymitch to the list.These are the people I must take with me when I escape into the wild. How I willconvince them, where we will go in the dead of winter, what it will take toevade capture are unanswered questions. But at least now I know what Imust do.So instead of crumpling to the ground and weeping, I find myself standing upstraighter and with more confidence than I have in weeks. My smile, whilesomewhat insane, is not forced. And when President Snow silences the audienceand says, “What do you think about us throwing them a wedding right here in theCapitol?” I pull off girl-almost-catatonic-with-joy without a hitch.Caesar Flickerman asks if the president has a date in mind.“Oh, before we set a date, we better clear it with Katniss’s mother,” says thepresident. The audience gives a big laugh and the president puts his arm aroundme. “Maybe if the whole country puts its mind to it, we can get you marriedbefore you’re thirty.”“You’ll probably have to pass a new law,” I say with a giggle.“If that’s what it takes,” says the president with conspiratorial good humor.Oh, the fun we two have together.The party, held in the banquet room of President Snow’s mansion, has no equal.The forty-foot ceiling has been transformed into the night sky, and the starslook exactly as they do at home. I suppose they look the same from the Capitol,but who would know? There’s always too much light from the city to see the starshere. About halfway between the floor and the ceiling, musicians float on whatlook like fluffy white clouds, but I can’t see what holds them aloft.Traditional dining tables have been replaced by innumerable stuffed sofas andchairs, some surrounding fireplaces, others beside fragrant flower gardens orponds filled with exotic fish, so that people can eat and drink and do whateverthey please in the utmost comfort. There’s a large tiled area in the center ofthe room that serves as everything from a dance floor, to a stage for theperformers who come and go, to another spot to mingle with the flamboyantlydressed guests.But the real star of the evening is the food. Tables laden with delicacies linethe walls. Everything you can think of, and things you have never dreamed of,lie in wait. Whole roasted cows and pigs and goats still turning on spits. Hugeplatters of fowl stuffed with savory fruits and nuts. Ocean creatures drizzledin sauces or begging to be dipped in spicy concoctions. Countless cheeses,breads, vegetables, sweets, waterfalls of wine, and streams of spirits thatflicker with flames.My appetite has returned with my desire to fight back. After weeks of feelingtoo worried to eat, I’m famished.“I want to taste everything in the room,” I tell Peeta.I can see him trying to read my expression, to figure out my transformation.Since he doesn’t know that President Snow thinks I have failed, he can onlyassume that I think we have succeeded. Perhaps even that I have some genuinehappiness at our engagement. His eyes reflect his puzzlement but only briefly,because we’re on camera. “Then you’d better pace yourself,” he says.“Okay, no more than one bite of each dish,” I say. My resolve is almostimmediately broken at the first table, which has twenty or so soups, when Iencounter a creamy pumpkin brew sprinkled with slivered nuts and tiny blackseeds. “I could just eat this all night!” I exclaim. But I don’t. I weaken againat a clear green broth that I can only describe as tasting like springtime, andagain when I try a frothy pink soup dotted with raspberries.Faces appear, names are exchanged, pictures taken, kisses brushed on cheeks.Apparently my mockingjay pin has spawned a new fashion sensation, becauseseveral people come up to show me their accessories. My bird has been replicatedon belt buckles, embroidered into silk lapels, even tattooed in intimate places.Everyone wants to wear the winner’s token. I can only imagine how nuts thatmakes President Snow. But what can he do? The Games were such a hit here, wherethe berries were only a symbol of a desperate girl trying to save her lover.Peeta and I make no effort to find company but are constantly sought out. We arewhat no one wants to miss at the party. I act delighted, but I have zerointerest in these Capitol people. They are only distractions from the food.Every table presents new temptations, and even on my restrictedone-taste-per-dish regimen, I begin filling up quickly. I pick up a smallroasted bird, bite into it, and my tongue floods with orange sauce. Delicious.But I make Peeta eat the remainder because I want to keep tasting things, andthe idea of throwing away food, as I see so many people doing so casually, isabhorrent to me. After about ten tables I’m stuffed, and we’ve only sampled asmall number of the dishes available.Just then my prep team descends on us. They’re nearly incoherent between thealcohol they’ve consumed and their ecstasy at being at such a grand affair.“Why aren’t you eating?” asks Octavia.“I have been, but I can’t hold another bite,” I say. They all laugh as if that’sthe silliest thing they’ve ever heard.“No one lets that stop them!” says Flavius. They lead us over to a table thatholds tiny stemmed wineglasses filled with clear liquid. “Drink this!”Peeta picks one up to take a sip and they lose it.“Not here!” shrieks Octavia.“You have to do it in there,” says Venia, pointing to doors that lead to thetoilets. “Or you’ll get it all over the floor!”Peeta looks at the glass again and puts it together. “You mean this will make mepuke?”My prep team laughs hysterically. “Of course, so you can keep eating,” saysOctavia. “I’ve been in there twice already. Everyone does it, or else how wouldyou have any fun at a feast?”I’m speechless, staring at the pretty little glasses and all they imply. Peetasets his back on the table with such precision you’d think it might detonate.“Come on, Katniss, let’s dance.”Music filters down from the clouds as he leads me away from the team, the table,and out onto the floor. We know only a few dances at home, the kind that go withfiddle and flute music and require a good deal of space. But Effie has shown ussome that are popular in the Capitol. The music’s slow and dreamlike, so Peetapulls me into his arms and we move in a circle with practically no steps at all.You could do this dance on a pie plate. We’re quiet for a while. Then Peetaspeaks in a strained voice.“You go along, thinking you can deal with it, thinking maybe they’re not so bad,and then you —” He cuts himself off.All I can think of is the emaciated bodies of the children on our kitchen tableas my mother prescribes what the parents can’t give. More food. Now that we’rerich, she’ll send some home with them. But often in the old days, there wasnothing to give and the child was past saving, anyway. And here in the Capitolthey’re vomiting for the pleasure of filling their bellies again and again. Notfrom some illness of body or mind, not from spoiled food. It’s what everyonedoes at a party. Expected. Part of the fun.One day when I dropped by to give Hazelle the game, Vick was home sick with abad cough. Being part of Gale’s family, the kid has to eat better than ninetypercent of the rest of District 12. But he still spent about fifteen minutestalking about how they’d opened a can of corn syrup from Parcel Day and each hada spoonful on bread and were going to maybe have more later in the week. HowHazelle had said he could have a bit in a cup of tea to soothe his cough, but hewouldn’t feel right unless the others had some, too. If it’s like that atGale’s, what’s it like in the other houses?“Peeta, they bring us here to fight to the death for their entertainment,” Isay. “Really, this is nothing by comparison.”“I know. I know that. It’s just sometimes I can’t stand it anymore. To the pointwhere . . . I’m not sure what I’ll do.” He pauses, then whispers, “Maybe we werewrong, Katniss.”“About what?” I ask.“About trying to subdue things in the districts,” he says.My head turns swiftly from side to side, but no one seems to have heard. Thecamera crew got sidetracked at a table of shellfish, and the couples dancingaround us are either too drunk or too self-involved to notice.“Sorry,” he says. He should be. This is no place to be voicing such thoughts.“Save it for home,” I tell him.Just then Portia appears with a large man who looks vaguely familiar. Sheintroduces him as Plutarch Heavensbee, the new Head Gamemaker. Plutarch asksPeeta if he can steal me for a dance. Peeta’s recovered his camera face andgood-naturedly passes me over, warning the man not to get too attached.I don’t want to dance with Plutarch Heavensbee. I don’t want to feel his hands,one resting against mine, one on my hip. I’m not used to being touched, exceptby Peeta or my family, and I rank Gamemakers somewhere below maggots in terms ofcreatures I want in contact with my skin. But he seems to sense this and holdsme almost at arm’s length as we turn on the floor.We chitchat about the party, about the entertainment, about the food, and thenhe makes a joke about avoiding punch since training. I don’t get it, and then Irealize he’s the man who tripped backward into the punch bowl when I shot anarrow at the Gamemakers during the training session. Well, not really. I wasshooting an apple out of their roast pig’s mouth. But I made them jump.“Oh, you’re one who —” I laugh, remembering him splashing back into the punchbowl.“Yes. And you’ll be pleased to know I’ve never recovered,” says Plutarch.I want to point out that twenty-two dead tributes will never recover from theGames he helped create, either. But I only say, “Good. So, you’re the HeadGamemaker this year? That must be a big honor.”“Between you and me, there weren’t many takers for the job,” he says. “So muchresponsibility as to how the Games turn out.”Yeah, the last guy’s dead, I think. He must know about Seneca Crane, but hedoesn’t look the least bit concerned. “Are you planning the Quarter Quell Gamesalready?” I say.“Oh, yes. Well, they’ve been in the works for years, of course. Arenas aren’tbuilt in a day. But the, shall we say, flavor of the Games is being determinednow. Believe it or not, I’ve got a strategy meeting tonight,” he says.Plutarch steps back and pulls out a gold watch on a chain from a vest pocket. Heflips open the lid, sees the time, and frowns. “I’ll have to be going soon.” Heturns the watch so I can see the face. “It starts at midnight.”“That seems late for —” I say, but then something distracts me. Plutarch has runhis thumb across the crystal face of the watch and for just a moment an imageappears, glowing as if lit by candlelight. It’s another mockingjay. Exactly likethe pin on my dress. Only this one disappears. He snaps the watch closed.“That’s very pretty,” I say.“Oh, it’s more than pretty. It’s one of a kind,” he says. “If anyone asks aboutme, say I’ve gone home to bed. The meetings are supposed to be kept secret. ButI thought it’d be safe to tell you.”“Yes. Your secret’s safe with me,” I say.As we shake hands, he gives a small bow, a common gesture here in the Capitol.“Well, I’ll see you next summer at the Games, Katniss. Best wishes on yourengagement, and good luck with your mother.”“I’ll need it,” I say.Plutarch disappears and I wander through the crowd, looking for Peeta, asstrangers congratulate me. On my engagement, on my victory at the Games, on mychoice of lipstick. I respond, but really I’m thinking about Plutarch showingoff his pretty, one-of-a-kind watch to me. There was something strange about it.Almost clandestine. But why? Maybe he thinks someone else will steal his idea ofputting a disappearing mockingjay on a watch face. Yes, he probably paid afortune for it and now he can’t show it to anyone because he’s afraid someonewill make a cheap, knockoff version. Only in the Capitol.I find Peeta admiring a table of elaborately decorated cakes. Bakers have comein from the kitchen especially to talk frosting with him, and you can see themtripping over one another to answer his questions. At his request, they assemblean assortment of little cakes for him to take back to District 12, where he canexamine their work in quiet.“Effie said we have to be on the train at one. I wonder what time it is,” hesays, glancing around.“Almost midnight,” I reply. I pluck a chocolate flower from a cake with myfingers and nibble on it, so beyond worrying about manners.“Time to say thank you and farewell!” trills Effie at my elbow. It’s one ofthose moments when I just love her compulsive punctuality. We collect Cinna andPortia, and she escorts us around to say good-bye to important people, thenherds us to the door.“Shouldn’t we thank President Snow?” asks Peeta. “It’s his house.”“Oh, he’s not a big one for parties. Too busy,” says Effie. “I’ve alreadyarranged for the necessary notes and gifts to be sent to him tomorrow. There youare!” Effie gives a little wave to two Capitol attendants who have an inebriatedHaymitch propped up between them.We travel through the streets of the Capitol in a car with darkened windows.Behind us, another car brings the prep teams. The throngs of people celebratingare so thick it’s slow going. But Effie has this all down to a science, and atexactly one o’clock we are back on the train and it’s pulling out of thestation.Haymitch is deposited in his room. Cinna orders tea and we all take seats aroundthe table while Effie rattles her schedule papers and reminds us we’re still ontour. “There’s the Harvest Festival in District Twelve to think about. So Isuggest we drink our tea and head straight to bed.” No one argues.When I open my eyes, it’s early afternoon. My head rests on Peeta’s arm. I don’tremember him coming in last night. I turn, being careful not to disturb him, buthe’s already awake.“No nightmares,” he says.“What?” I ask.“You didn’t have any nightmares last night,” he says.He’s right. For the first time in ages I’ve slept through the night. “I had adream, though,” I say, thinking back. “I was following a mockingjay through thewoods. For a long time. It was Rue, really. I mean, when it sang, it had hervoice.”“Where did she take you?” he says, brushing my hair off my forehead.“I don’t know. We never arrived,” I say. “But I felt happy.”“Well, you slept like you were happy,” he says.“Peeta, how come I never know when you’re having a nightmare?” I say.“I don’t know. I don’t think I cry out or thrash around or anything. I just cometo, paralyzed with terror,” he says.“You should wake me,” I say, thinking about how I can interrupt his sleep two orthree times on a bad night. About how long it can take to calm me down.“It’s not necessary. My nightmares are usually about losing you,” he says. “I’mokay once I realize you’re here.”Ugh. Peeta makes comments like this in such an offhand way, and it’s like beinghit in the gut. He’s only answering my question honestly. He’s not pressing meto reply in kind, to make any declaration of love. But I still feel awful, as ifI’ve been using him in some terrible way. Have I? I don’t know. I only know thatfor the first time, I feel immoral about him being here in my bed. Which isironic since we’re officially engaged now.“Be worse when we’re home and I’m sleeping alone again,” he says.That’s right, we’re almost home.The agenda for District 12 includes a dinner at Mayor Undersee’s house tonightand a victory rally in the square during the Harvest Festival tomorrow. Wealways celebrate the Harvest Festival on the final day of the Victory Tour, butusually it means a meal at home or with a few friends if you can afford it. Thisyear it will be a public affair, and since the Capitol will be throwing it,everyone in the whole district will have full bellies.Most of our prepping will take place at the mayor’s house, since we’re back tobeing covered in furs for outdoor appearances. We’re only at the train stationbriefly, to smile and wave as we pile into our car. We don’t even get to see ourfamilies until the dinner tonight.I’m glad it will be at the mayor’s house instead of at the Justice Building,where the memorial for my father was held, where they took me after the reapingfor those wrenching good-byes to my family. The Justice Building is too full ofsadness.But I like Mayor Undersee’s house, especially now that his daughter, Madge, andI are friends. We always were, in a way. It became official when she came to saygood-bye to me before I left for the Games. When she gave me the mockingjay pinfor luck. After I got home, we started spending time together. It turns outMadge has plenty of empty hours to fill, too. It was a little awkward at firstbecause we didn’t know what to do. Other girls our age, I’ve heard them talkingabout boys, or other girls, or clothes. Madge and I aren’t gossipy and clothesbore me to tears. But after a few false starts, I realized she was dying to gointo the woods, so I’ve taken her a couple of times and showed her how to shoot.She’s trying to teach me the piano, but mostly I like to listen to her play.Sometimes we eat at each other’s houses. Madge likes mine better. Her parentsseem nice but I don’t think she sees a whole lot of them. Her father hasDistrict 12 to run and her mother gets fierce headaches that force her to stayin bed for days.“Maybe you should take her to the Capitol,” I said during one of them. Weweren’t playing the piano that day, because even two floors away the soundcaused her mother pain. “They can fix her up, I bet.”“Yes. But you don’t go to the Capitol unless they invite you,” said Madgeunhappily. Even the mayor’s privileges are limited.When we reach the mayor’s house, I only have time to give Madge a quick hugbefore Effie hustles me off to the third floor to get ready. After I’m preppedand dressed in a full-length silver gown, I’ve still got an hour to kill beforethe dinner, so I slip off to find her.Madge’s bedroom is on the second floor along with several guest rooms and herfather’s study. I stick my head in the study to say hello to the mayor but it’sempty. The television’s droning on, and I stop to watch shots of Peeta and me atthe Capitol party last night. Dancing, eating, kissing. This will be playing inevery household in Panem right now. The audience must be sick to death of thestar-crossed lovers from District 12. I know I am.I’m leaving the room when a beeping noise catches my attention. I turn back tosee the screen of the television go black. Then the words “UPDATE ON DISTRICT 8”start flashing. Instinctively I know this is not for my eyes but somethingintended only for the mayor. I should go. Quickly. Instead I find myselfstepping closer to the television.An announcer I’ve never seen before appears. It’s a woman with graying hair anda hoarse, authoritative voice. She warns that conditions are worsening and aLevel 3 alert has been called. Additional forces are being sent into District 8,and all textile production has ceased.They cut away from the woman to the main square in District 8. I recognize itbecause I was there only last week. There are still banners with my face wavingfrom the rooftops. Below them, there’s a mob scene. The square’s packed withscreaming people, their faces hidden with rags and homemade masks, throwingbricks. Buildings burn. Peacekeepers shoot into the crowd, killing at random.I’ve never seen anything like it, but I can only be witnessing one thing. Thisis what President Snow calls an uprising."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00017.jpg]A leather bag filled with food and a flask of hot tea. A pair of fur-linedgloves that Cinna left behind. Three twigs, broken from the naked trees, lyingin the snow, pointing in the direction I will travel. This is what I leave forGale at our usual meeting place on the first Sunday after the Harvest Festival.I have continued on through the cold, misty woods, breaking a path that will beunfamiliar to Gale but is simple for my feet to find. It leads to the lake. I nolonger trust that our regular rendezvous spot offers privacy, and I’ll need thatand more to spill my guts to Gale today. But will he even come? If he doesn’t,I’ll have no choice but to risk going to his house in the dead of night. Thereare things he has to know . . . things I need him to help me figure out. . . .Once the implications of what I was seeing on Mayor Undersee’s television hitme, I made for the door and started down the hall. Just in time, too, becausethe mayor came up the steps moments later. I gave him a wave.“Looking for Madge?” he said in a friendly tone.“Yes. I want to show her my dress,” I said.“Well, you know where to find her.” Just then, another round of beeping camefrom his study. His face turned grave. “Excuse me,” he said. He went into hisstudy and closed the door tightly.I waited in the hall until I had composed myself. Reminded myself I must actnaturally. Then I found Madge in her room, sitting at her dressing table,brushing out her wavy blond hair before a mirror. She was in the same prettywhite dress she’d worn on reaping day. She saw my reflection behind her andsmiled. “Look at you. Like you came right off the streets of the Capitol.”I stepped in closer. My fingers touched the mockingjay. “Even my pin now.Mockingjays are all the rage in the Capitol, thanks to you. Are you sure youdon’t want it back?” I asked.“Don’t be silly, it was a gift,” said Madge. She tied back her hair in a festivegold ribbon.“Where did you get it, anyway?” I asked.“It was my aunt’s,” she said. “But I think it’s been in the family a long time.”“It’s a funny choice, a mockingjay,” I said. “I mean, because of what happenedin the rebellion. With the jabberjays backfiring on the Capitol and all.”The jabberjays were muttations, genetically enhanced male birds created by theCapitol as weapons to spy on rebels in the districts. They could remember andrepeat long passages of human speech, so they were sent into rebel areas tocapture our words and return them to the Capitol. The rebels caught on andturned them against the Capitol by sending them home loaded with lies. When thiswas discovered, the jabberjays were left to die. In a few years, they becameextinct in the wild, but not before they had mated with female mockingbirds,creating an entirely new species.“But mockingjays were never a weapon,” said Madge. “They’re just songbirds.Right?”“Yeah, I guess so,” I said. But it’s not true. A mockingbird is just a songbird.A mockingjay is a creature the Capitol never intended to exist. They hadn’tcounted on the highly controlled jabberjay having the brains to adapt to thewild, to pass on its genetic code, to thrive in a new form. They hadn’tanticipated its will to live.Now, as I trudge through the snow, I see the mockingjays hopping about onbranches as they pick up on other birds’ melodies, replicate them, and thentransform them into something new. As always, they remind me of Rue. I think ofthe dream I had the last night on the train, where I followed her in mockingjayform. I wish I could have stayed asleep just a bit longer and found out whereshe was trying to take me.It’s a hike to the lake, no question. If he decides to follow me at all, Gale’sgoing to be put out by this excessive use of energy that could be better spentin hunting. He was conspicuously absent from the dinner at the mayor’s house,although the rest of his family came. Hazelle said he was home sick, which wasan obvious lie. I couldn’t find him at the Harvest Festival, either. Vick toldme he was out hunting. That was probably true.After a couple of hours, I reach an old house near the edge of the lake. Maybe“house” is too big a word for it. It’s only one room, about twelve feet square.My father thought that a long time ago there were a lot of buildings — you canstill see some of the foundations — and people came to them to play and fish inthe lake. This house outlasted the others because it’s made of concrete. Floor,roof, ceiling. Only one of four glass windows remains, wavy and yellowed bytime. There’s no plumbing and no electricity, but the fireplace still works andthere’s a woodpile in the corner that my father and I collected years ago. Istart a small fire, counting on the mist to obscure any telltale smoke. Whilethe fire catches, I sweep out the snow that has accumulated under the emptywindows, using a twig broom my father made me when I was about eight and Iplayed house here. Then I sit on the tiny concrete hearth, thawing out by thefire and waiting for Gale.It’s a surprisingly short time before he appears. A bow slung over his shoulder,a dead wild turkey he must have encountered along the way hanging from his belt.He stands in the doorway as if considering whether or not to enter. He holds theunopened leather bag of food, the flask, Cinna’s gloves. Gifts he will notaccept because of his anger at me. I know exactly how he feels. Didn’t I do thesame thing to my mother?I look in his eyes. His temper can’t quite mask the hurt, the sense of betrayalhe feels at my engagement to Peeta. This will be my last chance, this meetingtoday, to not lose Gale forever. I could take hours trying to explain, and eventhen have him refuse me. Instead I go straight to the heart of my defense.“President Snow personally threatened to have you killed,” I say.Gale raises his eyebrows slightly, but there’s no real show of fear orastonishment. “Anyone else?”“Well, he didn’t actually give me a copy of the list. But it’s a good guess itincludes both our families,” I say.It’s enough to bring him to the fire. He crouches before the hearth and warmshimself. “Unless what?”“Unless nothing, now,” I say. Obviously this requires more of an explanation,but I have no idea where to start, so I just sit there staring gloomily into thefire.After about a minute of this, Gale breaks the silence. “Well, thanks for theheads-up.”I turn to him, ready to snap, but I catch the glint in his eye. I hate myselffor smiling. This is not a funny moment, but I guess it’s a lot to drop onsomeone. We’re all going to be obliterated no matter what. “I do have a plan,you know.”“Yeah, I bet it’s a stunner,” he says. He tosses the gloves on my lap. “Here. Idon’t want your fiancé’s old gloves.”“He’s not my fiancé. That’s just part of the act. And these aren’t his gloves.They were Cinna’s,” I say.“Give them back, then,” he says. He pulls on the gloves, flexes his fingers, andnods in approval. “At least I’ll die in comfort.”“That’s optimistic. Of course, you don’t know what’s happened,” I say.“Let’s have it,” he says.I decide to begin with the night Peeta and I were crowned victors of the HungerGames, and Haymitch warned me of the Capitol’s fury. I tell him about theuneasiness that dogged me even once I was back home, President Snow’s visit tomy house, the murders in District 11, the tension in the crowds, the last-ditcheffort of the engagement, the president’s indication that it hadn’t been enough,my certainty that I’ll have to pay.Gale never interrupts. While I talk, he tucks the gloves in his pocket andoccupies himself with turning the food in the leather bag into a meal for us.Toasting bread and cheese, coring apples, placing chestnuts in the fire toroast. I watch his hands, his beautiful, capable fingers. Scarred, as mine werebefore the Capitol erased all marks from my skin, but strong and deft. Handsthat have the power to mine coal but the precision to set a delicate snare.Hands I trust.I pause to take a drink of tea from the flask before I tell him about myhomecoming.“Well, you really made a mess of things,” he says.“I’m not even done,” I tell him.“I’ve heard enough for the moment. Let’s skip ahead to this plan of yours,” hesays.I take a deep breath. “We run away.”“What?” he asks. This has actually caught him off guard.“We take to the woods and make a run for it,” I say. His face is impossible toread. Will he laugh at me, dismiss this as foolishness? I rise in agitation,preparing for an argument. “You said yourself you thought that we could do it!That morning of the reaping. You said —”He steps in and I feel myself lifted off the ground. The room spins, and I haveto lock my arms around Gale’s neck to brace myself. He’s laughing, happy.“Hey!” I protest, but I’m laughing, too.Gale sets me down but doesn’t release his hold on me. “Okay, let’s run away,” hesays.“Really? You don’t think I’m mad? You’ll go with me?” Some of the crushingweight begins to lift as it transfers to Gale’s shoulders.“I do think you’re mad and I’ll still go with you,” he says. He means it. Notonly means it but welcomes it. “We can do it. I know we can. Let’s get out ofhere and never come back!”“You’re sure?” I say. “Because it’s going to be hard, with the kids and all. Idon’t want to get five miles into the woods and have you —”“I’m sure. I’m completely, entirely, one hundred percent sure.” He tilts hisforehead down to rest against mine and pulls me closer. His skin, his wholebeing, radiates heat from being so near the fire, and I close my eyes, soakingin his warmth. I breathe in the smell of snow-dampened leather and smoke andapples, the smell of all those wintry days we shared before the Games. I don’ttry to move away. Why should I, anyway? His voice drops to a whisper. “I loveyou.”That’s why.I never see these things coming. They happen too fast. One second you’reproposing an escape plan and the next . . . you’re expected to deal withsomething like this. I come up with what must be the worst possible response. “Iknow.”It sounds terrible. Like I assume he couldn’t help loving me but that I don’tfeel anything in return. Gale starts to draw away, but I grab hold of him. “Iknow! And you . . . you know what you are to me.” It’s not enough. He breaks mygrip. “Gale, I can’t think about anyone that way now. All I can think about,every day, every waking minute since they drew Prim’s name at the reaping, ishow afraid I am. And there doesn’t seem to be room for anything else. If wecould get somewhere safe, maybe I could be different. I don’t know.”I can see him swallowing his disappointment. “So, we’ll go. We’ll find out.” Heturns back to the fire, where the chestnuts are beginning to burn. He flips themout onto the hearth. “My mother’s going to take some convincing.”I guess he’s still going, anyway. But the happiness has fled, leaving anall-too-familiar strain in its place. “Mine, too. I’ll just have to make her seereason. Take her for a long walk. Make sure she understands we won’t survive thealternative.”“She’ll understand. I watched a lot of the Games with her and Prim. She won’tsay no to you,” says Gale.“I hope not.” The temperature in the house seems to have dropped twenty degreesin a matter of seconds. “Haymitch will be the real challenge.”“Haymitch?” Gale abandons the chestnuts. “You’re not asking him to come withus?”“I have to, Gale. I can’t leave him and Peeta because they’d —” His scowl cutsme off. “What?”“I’m sorry. I didn’t realize how large our party was,” he snaps at me.“They’d torture them to death, trying to find out where I was,” I say.“What about Peeta’s family? They’ll never come. In fact, they probably couldn’twait to inform on us. Which I’m sure he’s smart enough to realize. What if hedecides to stay?” he asks.I try to sound indifferent, but my voice cracks. “Then he stays.”“You’d leave him behind?” Gale asks.“To save Prim and my mother, yes,” I answer. “I mean, no! I’ll get him to come.”“And me, would you leave me?” Gale’s expression is rock hard now. “Just if, forinstance, I can’t convince my mother to drag three young kids into thewilderness in winter.”“Hazelle won’t refuse. She’ll see sense,” I say.“Suppose she doesn’t, Katniss. What then?” he demands.“Then you have to force her, Gale. Do you think I’m making this stuff up?” Myvoice is rising in anger as well.“No. I don’t know. Maybe the president’s just manipulating you. I mean, he’sthrowing your wedding. You saw how the Capitol crowd reacted. I don’t think hecan afford to kill you. Or Peeta. How’s he going to get out of that one?” saysGale.“Well, with an uprising in District Eight, I doubt he’s spending much timechoosing my wedding cake!” I shout.The instant the words are out of my mouth I want to reclaim them. Their effecton Gale is immediate — the flush on his cheeks, the brightness of his gray eyes.“There’s an uprising in Eight?” he says in a hushed voice.I try to backpedal. To defuse him, as I tried to defuse the districts. “I don’tknow if it’s really an uprising. There’s unrest. People in the streets — ” Isay.Gale grabs my shoulders. “What did you see?”“Nothing! In person. I just heard something.” As usual, it’s too little, toolate. I give up and tell him. “I saw something on the mayor’s television. Iwasn’t supposed to. There was a crowd, and fires, and the Peacekeepers weregunning people down but they were fighting back. . . .” I bite my lip andstruggle to continue describing the scene. Instead I say aloud the words thathave been eating me up inside. “And it’s my fault, Gale. Because of what I didin the arena. If I had just killed myself with those berries, none of thiswould’ve happened. Peeta could have come home and lived, and everyone else wouldhave been safe, too.”“Safe to do what?” he says in a gentler tone. “Starve? Work like slaves? Sendtheir kids to the reaping? You haven’t hurt people — you’ve given them anopportunity. They just have to be brave enough to take it. There’s already beentalk in the mines. People who want to fight. Don’t you see? It’s happening! It’sfinally happening! If there’s an uprising in District Eight, why not here? Whynot everywhere? This could be it, the thing we’ve been —”“Stop it! You don’t know what you’re saying. The Peacekeepers outside of Twelve,they’re not like Darius, or even Cray! The lives of district people — they meanless than nothing to them!” I say.“That’s why we have to join the fight!” he answers harshly.“No! We have to leave here before they kill us and a lot of other people, too!”I’m yelling again, but I can’t understand why he’s doing this. Why doesn’t hesee what’s so undeniable?Gale pushes me roughly away from him. “You leave, then. I’d never go in amillion years.”“You were happy enough to go before. I don’t see how an uprising in DistrictEight does anything but make it more important that we leave. You’re just madabout —” No, I can’t throw Peeta in his face. “What about your family?”“What about the other families, Katniss? The ones who can’t run away? Don’t yousee? It can’t be about just saving us anymore. Not if the rebellion’s begun!”Gale shakes his head, not hiding his disgust with me. “You could do so much.” Hethrows Cinna’s gloves at my feet. “I changed my mind. I don’t want anything theymade in the Capitol.” And he’s gone.I look down at the gloves. Anything they made in the Capitol? Was that directedat me? Does he think I am now just another product of the Capitol and thereforesomething untouchable? The unfairness of it all fills me with rage. But it’smixed up with fear over what kind of crazy thing he might do next.I sink down next to the fire, desperate for comfort, to work out my next move. Icalm myself by thinking that rebellions don’t happen in a day. Gale can’t talkto the miners until tomorrow. If I can get to Hazelle before then, she mightstraighten him out. But I can’t go now. If he’s there, he’ll lock me out. Maybetonight, after everyone else is asleep . . . Hazelle often works late into thenight finishing up laundry. I could go then, tap at the window, tell her thesituation so she’ll keep Gale from doing anything foolish.My conversation with President Snow in the study comes back to me.“My advisors were concerned you would be difficult, but you’re not planning onbeing difficult at all, are you?”“No.”“That’s what I told them. I said any girl who goes to such lengths to preserveher life isn’t going to be interested in throwing it away with both hands.”I think of how hard Hazelle has worked to keep that family alive. Surely she’llbe on my side in this matter. Or won’t she?It must be getting on toward noon now and the days are so short. No point inbeing in the woods after dark if you don’t have to. I stamp out the remains ofmy little fire, clear up the scraps of food, and tuck Cinna’s gloves in my belt.I guess I’ll hang on to them for a while. In case Gale has a change of heart. Ithink of the look on his face when he flung them to the ground. How repelled hewas by them, by me . . .I trudge through the woods and reach my old house while there’s still light. Myconversation with Gale was an obvious setback, but I’m still determined to carryon with my plan to escape District 12. I decide to find Peeta next. In a strangeway, since he’s seen some of what I’ve seen on the tour, he may be an easiersell than Gale was. I run into him as he’s leaving the Victor’s Village.“Been hunting?” he asks. You can see he doesn’t think it’s a good idea.“Not really. Going to town?” I ask.“Yes. I’m supposed to eat dinner with my family,” he says.“Well, I can at least walk you in.” The road from the Victor’s Village to thesquare gets little use. It’s a safe enough place to talk. But I can’t seem toget the words out. Proposing it to Gale was such a disaster. I gnaw on mychapped lips. The square gets closer with every step. I may not have anopportunity again soon. I take a deep breath and let the words rush out. “Peeta,if I asked you to run away from the district with me, would you?”Peeta takes my arm, bringing me to a stop. He doesn’t need to check my face tosee if I’m serious. “Depends on why you’re asking.”“President Snow wasn’t convinced by me. There’s an uprising in District Eight.We have to get out,” I say.“By ‘we’ do you mean just you and me? No. Who else would be going?” he asks.“My family. Yours, if they want to come. Haymitch, maybe,” I say.“What about Gale?” he says.“I don’t know. He might have other plans,” I say.Peeta shakes his head and gives me a rueful smile. “I bet he does. Sure,Katniss, I’ll go.”I feel a slight twinge of hope. “You will?”“Yeah. But I don’t think for a minute you will,” he says.I jerk my arm away. “Then you don’t know me. Be ready. It could be any time.” Itake off walking and he follows a pace or two behind.“Katniss,” Peeta says. I don’t slow down. If he thinks it’s a bad idea, I don’twant to know, because it’s the only one I have. “Katniss, hold up.” I kick adirty, frozen chunk of snow off the path and let him catch up. The coal dustmakes everything look especially ugly. “I really will go, if you want me to. Ijust think we better talk it through with Haymitch. Make sure we won’t be makingthings worse for everyone.” He raises his head. “What’s that?”I lift my chin. I’ve been so consumed with my own worries, I haven’t noticed thestrange noise coming from the square. A whistling, the sound of an impact, theintake of breath from a crowd.“Come on,” Peeta says, his face suddenly hard. I don’t know why. I can’t placethe sound, even guess at the situation. But it means something bad to him.When we reach the square, it’s clear something’s happening, but the crowd’s toothick to see. Peeta steps up on a crate against the wall of the sweetshop andoffers me a hand while he scans the square. I’m halfway up when he suddenlyblocks my way. “Get down. Get out of here!” He’s whispering, but his voice isharsh with insistence.“What?” I say, trying to force my way back up.“Go home, Katniss! I’ll be there in a minute, I swear!” he says.Whatever it is, it’s terrible. I yank away from his hand and begin to push myway through the crowd. People see me, recognize my face, and then look panicked.Hands shove me back. Voices hiss.“Get out of here, girl.”“Only make it worse.”“What do you want to do? Get him killed?”But at this point, my heart is beating so fast and fierce I hardly hear them. Ionly know that whatever waits in the middle of the square is meant for me. WhenI finally break through to the cleared space, I see I am right. And Peeta wasright. And those voices were right, too.Gale’s wrists are bound to a wooden post. The wild turkey he shot earlier hangsabove him, the nail driven through its neck. His jacket’s been cast aside on theground, his shirt torn away. He slumps unconscious on his knees, held up only bythe ropes at his wrists. What used to be his back is a raw, bloody slab of meat.Standing behind him is a man I’ve never seen, but I recognize his uniform. It’sthe one designated for our Head Peacekeeper. This isn’t old Cray, though. Thisis a tall, muscular man with sharp creases in his pants.The pieces of the picture do not quite come together until I see his arm raisethe whip."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00020.jpg]“No!” I cry, and spring forward. It’s too late to stop the arm from descending,and I instinctively know I won’t have the power to block it. Instead I throwmyself directly between the whip and Gale. I’ve flung out my arms to protect asmuch of his broken body as possible, so there’s nothing to deflect the lash. Itake the full force of it across the left side of my face.The pain is blinding and instantaneous. Jagged flashes of light cross my visionand I fall to my knees. One hand cups my cheek while the other keeps me fromtipping over. I can already feel the welt rising up, the swelling closing myeye. The stones beneath me are wet with Gale’s blood, the air heavy with itsscent. “Stop it! You’ll kill him!” I shriek.I get a glimpse of my assailant’s face. Hard, with deep lines, a cruel mouth.Gray hair shaved almost to nonexistence, eyes so black they seem all pupils, along, straight nose reddened by the freezing air. The powerful arm lifts again,his sights set on me. My hand flies to my shoulder, hungry for an arrow, but, ofcourse, my weapons are stashed in the woods. I grit my teeth in anticipation ofthe next lash.“Hold it!” a voice barks. Haymitch appears and trips over a Peacekeeper lying onthe ground. It’s Darius. A huge purple lump pushes through the red hair on hisforehead. He’s knocked out but still breathing. What happened? Did he try tocome to Gale’s aid before I got here?Haymitch ignores him and pulls me to my feet roughly. “Oh, excellent.” His handlocks under my chin, lifting it. “She’s got a photo shoot next week modelingwedding dresses. What am I supposed to tell her stylist?”I see a flicker of recognition in the eyes of the man with the whip. Bundledagainst the cold, my face free of makeup, my braid tucked carelessly under mycoat, it wouldn’t be easy to identify me as the victor of the last Hunger Games.Especially with half my face swelling up. But Haymitch has been showing up ontelevision for years, and he’d be difficult to forget.The man rests the whip on his hip. “She interrupted the punishment of aconfessed criminal.”Everything about this man, his commanding voice, his odd accent, warns of anunknown and dangerous threat. Where has he come from? District 11? 3? From theCapitol itself?“I don’t care if she blew up the blasted Justice Building! Look at her cheek!Think that will be camera ready in a week?” Haymitch snarls.The man’s voice is still cold, but I can detect a slight edge of doubt. “That’snot my problem.”“No? Well, it’s about to be, my friend. The first call I make when I get home isto the Capitol,” says Haymitch. “Find out who authorized you to mess up myvictor’s pretty little face!”“He was poaching. What business is it of hers, anyway?” says the man.“He’s her cousin.” Peeta’s got my other arm now, but gently. “And she’s myfiancée. So if you want to get to him, expect to go through both of us.”Maybe we’re it. The only three people in the district who could make a standlike this. Although it’s sure to be temporary. There will be repercussions. Butat the moment, all I care about is keeping Gale alive. The new Head Peacekeeperglances over at his backup squad. With relief, I see they’re familiar faces, oldfriends from the Hob. You can tell by their expressions that they’re notenjoying the show.One, a woman named Purnia who eats regularly at Greasy Sae’s, steps forwardstiffly. “I believe, for a first offense, the required number of lashes has beendispensed, sir. Unless your sentence is death, which we would carry out byfiring squad.”“Is that the standard protocol here?” asks the Head Peacekeeper.“Yes, sir,” Purnia says, and several others nod in agreement. I’m sure none ofthem actually know because, in the Hob, the standard protocol for someoneshowing up with a wild turkey is for everybody to bid on the drumsticks.“Very well. Get your cousin out of here, then, girl. And if he comes to, remindhim that the next time he poaches off the Capitol’s land, I’ll assemble thatfiring squad personally.” The Head Peacekeeper wipes his hand along the lengthof the whip, splattering us with blood. Then he coils it into quick, neat loopsand walks off.Most of the other Peacekeepers fall in an awkward formation behind him. A smallgroup stays behind and hoists Darius’s body up by the arms and legs. I catchPurnia’s eye and mouth the word “Thanks” before she goes. She doesn’t respond,but I’m sure she understood.“Gale.” I turn, my hands fumbling at the knots binding his wrists. Someonepasses forward a knife and Peeta cuts the ropes. Gale collapses to the ground.“Better get him to your mother,” says Haymitch.There’s no stretcher, but the old woman at the clothing stall sells us the boardthat serves as her countertop. “Just don’t tell where you got it,” she says,packing up the rest of her goods quickly. Most of the square has emptied, feargetting the better of compassion. But after what just happened, I can’t blameanyone.By the time we’ve laid Gale facedown on the board, there’s only a handful ofpeople left to carry him. Haymitch, Peeta, and a couple of miners who work onthe same crew as Gale lift him up.Leevy, a girl who lives a few houses down from mine in the Seam, takes my arm.My mother kept her little brother alive last year when he caught the measles.“Need help getting back?” Her gray eyes are scared but determined.“No, but can you get Hazelle? Send her over?” I ask.“Yeah,” says Leevy, turning on her heel.“Leevy!” I say. “Don’t let her bring the kids.”“No. I’ll stay with them myself,” she says.“Thanks.” I grab Gale’s jacket and hurry after the others.“Get some snow on that,” Haymitch orders over his shoulder. I scoop up a handfulof snow and press it against my cheek, numbing a bit of the pain. My left eye’stearing heavily now, and in the dimming light it’s all I can do to follow theboots in front of me.As we walk I hear Bristel and Thom, Gale’s crewmates, piece together the storyof what happened. Gale must’ve gone to Cray’s house, as he’s done a hundredtimes, knowing Cray always pays well for a wild turkey. Instead he found the newHead Peacekeeper, a man they heard someone call Romulus Thread. No one knowswhat happened to Cray. He was buying white liquor in the Hob just this morning,apparently still in command of the district, but now he’s nowhere to be found.Thread put Gale under immediate arrest and, of course, since he was standingthere holding a dead turkey, there was little Gale could say in his own defense.Word of his predicament spread quickly. He was brought to the square, forced toplead guilty to his crime, and sentenced to a whipping to be carried outimmediately. By the time I showed up, he’d been lashed at least forty times. Hepassed out around thirty.“Lucky he only had the turkey on him,” says Bristel. “If he’d had his usualhaul, would’ve been much worse.”“He told Thread he found it wandering around the Seam. Said it got over thefence and he’d stabbed it with a stick. Still a crime. But if they’d known he’dbeen in the woods with weapons, they’d have killed him for sure,” says Thom.“What about Darius?” Peeta asks.“After about twenty lashes, he stepped in, saying that was enough. Only hedidn’t do it smart and official, like Purnia did. He grabbed Thread’s arm andThread hit him in the head with the butt of the whip. Nothing good waiting forhim,” says Bristel.“Doesn’t sound like much good for any of us,” says Haymitch.Snow begins, thick and wet, making visibility even more difficult. I stumble upthe walk to my house behind the others, using my ears more than my eyes to guideme. A golden light colors the snow as the door opens. My mother, who was nodoubt waiting for me after a long day of unexplained absence, takes in thescene.“New Head,” Haymitch says, and she gives him a curt nod as if no otherexplanation is needed.I’m filled with awe, as I always am, as I watch her transform from a woman whocalls me to kill a spider to a woman immune to fear. When a sick or dying personis brought to her . . . this is the only time I think my mother knows who sheis. In moments, the long kitchen table has been cleared, a sterile white clothspread across it, and Gale hoisted onto it. My mother pours water from a kettleinto a basin while ordering Prim to pull a series of her remedies from themedicine cabinet. Dried herbs and tinctures and store-bought bottles. I watchher hands, the long, tapered fingers crumbling this, adding drops of that, intothe basin. Soaking a cloth in the hot liquid as she gives Prim instructions toprepare a second brew.My mother glances my way. “Did it cut your eye?”“No, it’s just swelled shut,” I say.“Get more snow on it,” she instructs. But I am clearly not a priority.“Can you save him?” I ask my mother. She says nothing as she wrings out thecloth and holds it in the air to cool somewhat.“Don’t worry,” says Haymitch. “Used to be a lot of whipping before Cray. She’sthe one we took them to.”I can’t remember a time before Cray, a time when there was a Head Peacekeeperwho used the whip freely. But my mother must have been around my age and stillworking at the apothecary shop with her parents. Even back then, she must havehad healer’s hands.Ever so gently, she begins to clean the mutilated flesh on Gale’s back. I feelsick to my stomach, useless, the remaining snow dripping from my glove into apuddle on the floor. Peeta puts me in a chair and holds a cloth filled withfresh snow to my cheek.Haymitch tells Bristel and Thom to get home, and I see him press coins intotheir hands before they leave. “Don’t know what will happen with your crew,” hesays. They nod and accept the money.Hazelle arrives, breathless and flushed, fresh snow in her hair. Wordlessly, shesits on a stool next to the table, takes Gale’s hand, and holds it against herlips. My mother doesn’t acknowledge even her. She’s gone into that special zonethat includes only herself and the patient and occasionally Prim. The rest of uscan wait.Even in her expert hands, it takes a long time to clean the wounds, arrange whatshredded skin can be saved, apply a salve and a light bandage. As the bloodclears, I can see where every stroke of the lash landed and feel it resonate inthe single cut on my face. I multiply my own pain once, twice, forty times andcan only hope that Gale remains unconscious. Of course, that’s too much to askfor. As the final bandages are being placed, a moan escapes his lips. Hazellestrokes his hair and whispers something while my mother and Prim go throughtheir meager store of painkillers, the kind usually accessible only to doctors.They are hard to come by, expensive, and always in demand. My mother has to savethe strongest for the worst pain, but what is the worst pain? To me, it’s alwaysthe pain that is present. If I were in charge, those painkillers would be gonein a day because I have so little ability to watch suffering. My mother tries tosave them for those who are actually in the process of dying, to ease them outof the world.Since Gale is regaining consciousness, they decide on an herbal concoction hecan take by mouth. “That won’t be enough,” I say. They stare at me. “That won’tbe enough, I know how it feels. That will barely knock out a headache.”“We’ll combine it with sleep syrup, Katniss, and he’ll manage it. The herbs aremore for the inflammation —” my mother begins calmly.“Just give him the medicine!” I scream at her. “Give it to him! Who are you,anyway, to decide how much pain he can stand!”Gale begins stirring at my voice, trying to reach me. The movement causes freshblood to stain his bandages and an agonized sound to come from his mouth.“Take her out,” says my mother. Haymitch and Peeta literally carry me from theroom while I shout obscenities at her. They pin me down on a bed in one of theextra bedrooms until I stop fighting.While I lie there, sobbing, tears trying to squeeze out of the slit of my eye, Ihear Peeta whisper to Haymitch about President Snow, about the uprising inDistrict 8. “She wants us all to run,” he says, but if Haymitch has an opinionon this, he doesn’t offer it.After a while, my mother comes in and treats my face. Then she holds my hand,stroking my arm, while Haymitch fills her in on what happened with Gale.“So it’s starting again?” she says. “Like before?”“By the looks of it,” he answers. “Who’d have thought we’d ever be sorry to seeold Cray go?”Cray would have been disliked, anyway, because of the uniform he wore, but itwas his habit of luring starving young women into his bed for money that madehim an object of loathing in the district. In really bad times, the hungriestwould gather at his door at nightfall, vying for the chance to earn a few coinsto feed their families by selling their bodies. Had I been older when my fatherdied, I might have been among them. Instead I learned to hunt.I don’t know exactly what my mother means by things starting again, but I’m tooangry and hurting to ask. It’s registered, though, the idea of worse timesreturning, because when the doorbell rings, I shoot straight out of bed. Whocould it be at this hour of the night? There’s only one answer. Peacekeepers.“They can’t have him,” I say.“Might be you they’re after,” Haymitch reminds me.“Or you,” I say.“Not my house,” Haymitch points out. “But I’ll get the door.”“No, I’ll get it,” says my mother quietly.We all go, though, following her down the hallway to the insistent ring of thebell. When she opens it, there’s not a squad of Peacekeepers but a single,snow-caked figure. Madge. She holds out a small, damp cardboard box to me.“Use these for your friend,” she says. I take off the lid of the box, revealinghalf a dozen vials of clear liquid. “They’re my mother’s. She said I could takethem. Use them, please.” She runs back into the storm before we can stop her.“Crazy girl,” Haymitch mutters as we follow my mother into the kitchen.Whatever my mother had given Gale, I was right, it isn’t enough. His teeth aregritted and his flesh shines with sweat. My mother fills a syringe with theclear liquid from one of the vials and shoots it into his arm. Almostimmediately, his face begins to relax.“What is that stuff?” asks Peeta.“It’s from the Capitol. It’s called morphling,” my mother answers.“I didn’t even know Madge knew Gale,” says Peeta.“We used to sell her strawberries,” I say almost angrily. What am I angry about,though? Not that she has brought the medicine, surely.“She must have quite a taste for them,” says Haymitch.That’s what nettles me. It’s the implication that there’s something going onbetween Gale and Madge. And I don’t like it.“She’s my friend” is all I say.Now that Gale has drifted away on the painkiller, everyone seems to deflate.Prim makes us each eat some stew and bread. A room is offered to Hazelle, butshe has to go home to the other kids. Haymitch and Peeta are both willing tostay, but my mother sends them home to bed as well. She knows it’s pointless totry this with me and leaves me to tend Gale while she and Prim rest.Alone in the kitchen with Gale, I sit on Hazelle’s stool, holding his hand.After a while, my fingers find his face. I touch parts of him I have never hadcause to touch before. His heavy, dark eyebrows, the curve of his cheek, theline of his nose, the hollow at the base of his neck. I trace the outline ofstubble on his jaw and finally work my way to his lips. Soft and full, slightlychapped. His breath warms my chilled skin.Does everyone look younger asleep? Because right now he could be the boy I raninto in the woods years ago, the one who accused me of stealing from his traps.What a pair we were — fatherless, frightened, but fiercely committed, too, tokeeping our families alive. Desperate, yet no longer alone after that day,because we’d found each other. I think of a hundred moments in the woods, lazyafternoons fishing, the day I taught him to swim, that time I twisted my kneeand he carried me home. Mutually counting on each other, watching each other’sbacks, forcing each other to be brave.For the first time, I reverse our positions in my head. I imagine watching Galevolunteering to save Rory in the reaping, having him torn from my life, becomingsome strange girl’s lover to stay alive, and then coming home with her. Livingnext to her. Promising to marry her.The hatred I feel for him, for the phantom girl, for everything, is so real andimmediate that it chokes me. Gale is mine. I am his. Anything else isunthinkable. Why did it take him being whipped within an inch of his life to seeit?Because I’m selfish. I’m a coward. I’m the kind of girl who, when she mightactually be of use, would run to stay alive and leave those who couldn’t followto suffer and die. This is the girl Gale met in the woods today.No wonder I won the Games. No decent person ever does.You saved Peeta, I think weakly.But now I question even that. I knew good and well that my life back in District12 would be unlivable if I let that boy die.I rest my head forward on the edge of the table, overcome with loathing formyself. Wishing I had died in the arena. Wishing Seneca Crane had blown me tobits the way President Snow said he should have when I held out the berries.The berries. I realize the answer to who I am lies in that handful of poisonousfruit. If I held them out to save Peeta because I knew I would be shunned if Icame back without him, then I am despicable. If I held them out because I lovedhim, I am still self-centered, although forgivable. But if I held them out todefy the Capitol, I am someone of worth. The trouble is, I don’t know exactlywhat was going on inside me at that moment.Could it be the people in the districts are right? That it was an act ofrebellion, even if it was an unconscious one? Because, deep down, I must know itisn’t enough to keep myself, or my family, or my friends alive by running away.Even if I could. It wouldn’t fix anything. It wouldn’t stop people from beinghurt the way Gale was today.Life in District 12 isn’t really so different from life in the arena. At somepoint, you have to stop running and turn around and face whoever wants you dead.The hard thing is finding the courage to do it. Well, it’s not hard for Gale. Hewas born a rebel. I’m the one making an escape plan.“I’m so sorry,” I whisper. I lean forward and kiss him.His eyelashes flutter and he looks at me through a haze of opiates. “Hey,Catnip.”“Hey, Gale,” I say.“Thought you’d be gone by now,” he says.My choices are simple. I can die like quarry in the woods or I can die herebeside Gale. “I’m not going anywhere. I’m going to stay right here and cause allkinds of trouble.”“Me, too,” Gale says. He just manages a smile before the drugs pull him backunder."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00025.jpg]Someone gives my shoulder a shake and I sit up. I’ve fallen asleep with my faceon the table. The white cloth has left creases on my good cheek. The other, theone that took the lash from Thread, throbs painfully. Gale’s dead to the world,but his fingers are locked around mine. I smell fresh bread and turn my stiffneck to find Peeta looking down at me with such a sad expression. I get thesense that he’s been watching us awhile.“Go on up to bed, Katniss. I’ll look after him now,” he says.“Peeta. About what I said yesterday, about running —” I begin.“I know,” he says. “There’s nothing to explain.”I see the loaves of bread on the counter in the pale, snowy morning light. Theblue shadows under his eyes. I wonder if he slept at all. Couldn’t have beenlong. I think of his agreeing to go with me yesterday, his stepping up beside meto protect Gale, his willingness to throw his lot in with mine entirely when Igive him so little in return. No matter what I do, I’m hurting someone. “Peeta—”“Just go to bed, okay?” he says.I feel my way up the stairs, crawl under the covers, and fall asleep at once. Atsome point, Clove, the girl from District 2, enters my dreams. She chases me,pins me to the ground, and pulls out a knife to cut my face. It digs deeply intomy cheek, opening a wide gash. Then Clove begins to transform, her faceelongating into a snout, dark fur sprouting from her skin, her fingernailsgrowing into long claws, but her eyes remain unchanged. She becomes themuttation form of herself, the wolflike creation of the Capitol that terrorizedus the last night in the arena. Tossing back her head, she lets out a long,eerie howl that is picked up by other mutts nearby. Clove begins to lap theblood flowing from my wound, each lick sending a new wave of pain through myface. I give a strangled cry and wake with a start, sweating and shivering atonce. Cradling my damaged cheek in my hand, I remind myself that it was notClove but Thread who gave me this wound. I wish that Peeta were here to hold me,until I remember I’m not supposed to wish that anymore. I have chosen Gale andthe rebellion, and a future with Peeta is the Capitol’s design, not mine.The swelling around my eye has gone down and I can open it a bit. I push asidethe curtains and see the snowstorm has strengthened to a full-out blizzard.There’s nothing but whiteness and the howling wind that sounds remarkably likethe muttations.I welcome the blizzard, with its ferocious winds and deep, drifting snow. Thismay be enough to keep the real wolves, also known as the Peacekeepers, from mydoor. A few days to think. To work out a plan. With Gale and Peeta and Haymitchall at hand. This blizzard is a gift.Before I go down to face this new life, though, I take some time making myselfacknowledge what it will mean. Less than a day ago, I was prepared to head intothe wilderness with my loved ones in midwinter, with the very real possibilityof the Capitol pursuing us. A precarious venture at best. But now I amcommitting to something even more risky. Fighting the Capitol assures theirswift retaliation. I must accept that at any moment I can be arrested. Therewill be a knock on the door, like the one last night, a band of Peacekeepers tohaul me away. There might be torture. Mutilation. A bullet through my skull inthe town square, if I’m fortunate enough to go that quickly. The Capitol has noend of creative ways to kill people. I imagine these things and I’m terrified,but let’s face it: They’ve been lurking in the back of my brain, anyway. I’vebeen a tribute in the Games. Been threatened by the president. Taken a lashacross my face. I’m already a target.Now comes the harder part. I have to face the fact that my family and friendsmight share this fate. Prim. I need only to think of Prim and all my resolvedisintegrates. It’s my job to protect her. I pull the blanket up over my head,and my breathing is so rapid I use up all the oxygen and begin to choke for air.I can’t let the Capitol hurt Prim.And then it hits me. They already have. They have killed her father in thosewretched mines. They have sat by as she almost starved to death. They havechosen her as a tribute, then made her watch her sister fight to the death inthe Games. She has been hurt far worse than I had at the age of twelve. And eventhat pales in comparison with Rue’s life.I shove off the blanket and suck in the cold air that seeps through thewindowpanes.Prim . . . Rue . . . aren’t they the very reason I have to try to fight? Becausewhat has been done to them is so wrong, so beyond justification, so evil thatthere is no choice? Because no one has the right to treat them as they have beentreated?Yes. This is the thing to remember when fear threatens to swallow me up. What Iam about to do, whatever any of us are forced to endure, it is for them. It’stoo late to help Rue, but maybe not too late for those five little faces thatlooked up at me from the square in District 11. Not too late for Rory and Vickand Posy. Not too late for Prim.Gale is right. If people have the courage, this could be an opportunity. He’salso right that, since I have set it in motion, I could do so much. Although Ihave no idea what exactly that should be. But deciding not to run away is acrucial first step.I take a shower, and this morning my brain is not assembling lists of suppliesfor the wild, but trying to figure out how they organized that uprising inDistrict 8. So many, so clearly acting in defiance of the Capitol. Was it evenplanned, or something that simply erupted out of years of hatred and resentment?How could we do that here? Would the people of District 12 join in or lock theirdoors? Yesterday the square emptied so quickly after Gale’s whipping. But isn’tthat because we all feel so impotent and have no idea what to do? We needsomeone to direct us and reassure us this is possible. And I don’t think I’mthat person. I may have been a catalyst for rebellion, but a leader should besomeone with conviction, and I’m barely a convert myself. Someone withunflinching courage, and I’m still working hard at even finding mine. Someonewith clear and persuasive words, and I’m so easily tongue-tied.Words. I think of words and I think of Peeta. How people embrace everything hesays. He could move a crowd to action, I bet, if he chose to. Would find thethings to say. But I’m sure the idea has never crossed his mind.Downstairs, I find my mother and Prim tending to a subdued Gale. The medicinemust be wearing off, by the look on his face. I brace myself for another fightbut try to keep my voice calm. “Can’t you give him another shot?”“I will, if it’s needed. We thought we’d try the snow coat first,” says mymother. She has removed his bandages. You can practically see the heat radiatingoff his back. She lays a clean cloth across his angry flesh and nods to Prim.Prim comes over, stirring what appears to be a large bowl of snow. But it’stinted a light green and gives off a sweet, clean scent. Snow coat. Shecarefully begins to ladle the stuff onto the cloth. I can almost hear the sizzleof Gale’s tormented skin meeting the snow mixture. His eyes flutter open,perplexed, and then he lets out a sound of relief.“It’s lucky we have snow,” says my mother.I think of what it must be like to recover from a whipping in midsummer, withthe searing heat and the tepid water from the tap. “What did you do in warmmonths?” I ask.A crease appears between my mother’s eyebrows as she frowns. “Tried to keep theflies away.”My stomach turns at the thought. She fills a handkerchief with the snow-coatmixture and I hold it to the weal on my cheek. Instantly the pain withdraws.It’s the coldness of the snow, yes, but whatever mix of herbal juices my motherhas added numbs as well. “Oh. That’s wonderful. Why didn’t you put this on himlast night?”“I needed the wound to set first,” she says.I don’t know what that means exactly, but as long as it works, who am I toquestion her? She knows what she’s doing, my mother. I feel a pang of remorseabout yesterday, the awful things I yelled at her as Peeta and Haymitch draggedme from the kitchen. “I’m sorry. About screaming at you yesterday.”“I’ve heard worse,” she says. “You’ve seen how people are, when someone theylove is in pain.”Someone they love. The words numb my tongue as if it’s been packed in snow coat.Of course, I love Gale. But what kind of love does she mean? What do I mean whenI say I love Gale? I don’t know. I did kiss him last night, in a moment when myemotions were running so high. But I’m sure he doesn’t remember it. Does he? Ihope not. If he does, everything will just get more complicated and I reallycan’t think about kissing when I’ve got a rebellion to incite. I give my head alittle shake to clear it. “Where’s Peeta?” I say.“He went home when we heard you stirring. Didn’t want to leave his houseunattended during the storm,” says my mother.“Did he get back all right?” I ask. In a blizzard, you can get lost in a matterof yards and wander off course into oblivion.“Why don’t you give him a call and check?” she says.I go into the study, a room I’ve pretty much avoided since my meeting withPresident Snow, and dial Peeta’s number. After a few rings he answers.“Hey. I just wanted to make sure you got home,” I say.“Katniss, I live three houses away from you,” he says.“I know, but with the weather and all,” I say.“Well, I’m fine. Thank you for checking.” There’s a long pause. “How’s Gale?”“All right. My mother and Prim are giving him snow coat now,” I say.“And your face?” he asks.“I’ve got some, too,” I say. “Have you seen Haymitch today?”“I checked in on him. Dead drunk. But I built up his fire and left him somebread,” he says.“I wanted to talk to — to both of you.” I don’t dare add more, here on my phone,which is surely tapped.“Probably have to wait until after the weather calms down,” he says. “Nothingmuch will happen before that, anyway.”“No, nothing much,” I agree.It takes two days for the storm to blow itself out, leaving us with driftshigher than my head. Another day before the path is cleared from the Victor’sVillage to the square. During this time I help tend to Gale, apply snow coat tomy cheek, try to remember everything I can about the uprising in District 8, incase it will help us. The swelling in my face goes down, leaving me with anitchy, healing wound and a very black eye. But still, the first chance I get, Icall Peeta to see if he wants to go into town with me.We rouse Haymitch and drag him along with us. He complains, but not as much asusual. We all know we need to discuss what happened and it can’t be anywhere asdangerous as our homes in the Victor’s Village. In fact, we wait until thevillage is well behind us to even speak. I spend the time studying the ten-footwalls of snow piled up on either side of the narrow path that has been cleared,wondering if they will collapse in on us.Finally Haymitch breaks the silence. “So we’re all heading off into the greatunknown, are we?” he asks me.“No,” I say. “Not anymore.”“Worked through the flaws in that plan, did you, sweetheart?” he asks. “Any newideas?”“I want to start an uprising,” I say.Haymitch just laughs. It’s not even a mean laugh, which is more troubling. Itshows he can’t even take me seriously. “Well, I want a drink. You let me knowhow that works out for you, though,” he says.“Then what’s your plan?” I spit back at him.“My plan is to make sure everything is just perfect for your wedding,” saysHaymitch. “I called and rescheduled the photo shoot without giving too manydetails.”“You don’t even have a phone,” I say.“Effie had that fixed,” he says. “Do you know she asked me if I’d like to giveyou away? I told her the sooner the better.”“Haymitch.” I can hear the pleading creeping into my voice.“Katniss.” He mimics my tone. “It won’t work.”We shut up as a team of men with shovels passes us, headed out to the Victor’sVillage. Maybe they can do something about those ten-foot walls. And by the timethey’re out of earshot, the square is too close. We step into it and all come toa stop simultaneously.Nothing much will happen during the blizzard. That’s what Peeta and I hadagreed. But we couldn’t have been more wrong. The square has been transformed. Ahuge banner with the seal of Panem hangs off the roof of the Justice Building.Peacekeepers, in pristine white uniforms, march on the cleanly sweptcobblestones. Along the rooftops, more of them occupy nests of machine guns.Most unnerving is a line of new constructions — an official whipping post,several stockades, and a gallows — set up in the center of the square.“Thread’s a quick worker,” says Haymitch.Some streets away from the square, I see a blaze flare up. None of us has to sayit. That can only be the Hob going up in smoke. I think of Greasy Sae, Ripper,all my friends who make their living there.“Haymitch, you don’t think everyone was still in — ” I can’t finish thesentence.“Nah, they’re smarter than that. You’d be, too, if you’d been around longer,” hesays. “Well, I better go see how much rubbing alcohol the apothecary can spare.”He trudges off across the square and I look at Peeta. “What’s he want that for?”Then I realize the answer. “We can’t let him drink it. He’ll kill himself, or atthe very least go blind. I’ve got some white liquor put away at home.”“Me, too. Maybe that will hold him until Ripper finds a way to be back inbusiness,” says Peeta. “I need to check on my family.”“I have to go see Hazelle.” I’m worried now. I thought she’d be on our doorstepthe moment the snow was cleared. But there’s been no sign of her.“I’ll go, too. Drop by the bakery on my way home,” he says.“Thanks.” I’m suddenly very scared at what I might find.The streets are almost deserted, which would not be so unusual at this time ofday if people were at the mines, kids at school. But they’re not. I see facespeeking at us out of doorways, through cracks in shutters.An uprising, I think. What an idiot I am. There’s an inherent flaw in the planthat both Gale and I were too blind to see. An uprising requires breaking thelaw, thwarting authority. We’ve done that our whole lives, or our families have.Poaching, trading on the black market, mocking the Capitol in the woods. But formost people in District 12, a trip to buy something at the Hob would be toorisky. And I expect them to assemble in the square with bricks and torches? Eventhe sight of Peeta and me is enough to make people pull their children away fromthe windows and draw the curtains tightly.We find Hazelle in her house, nursing a very sick Posy. I recognize the measlesspots. “I couldn’t leave her,” she says. “I knew Gale’d be in the best possiblehands.”“Of course,” I say. “He’s much better. My mother says he’ll be back in the minesin a couple of weeks.”“May not be open until then, anyway,” says Hazelle. “Word is they’re closeduntil further notice.” She gives a nervous glance at her empty washtub.“You closed down, too?” I ask.“Not officially,” says Hazelle. “But everyone’s afraid to use me now.”“Maybe it’s the snow,” says Peeta.“No, Rory made a quick round this morning. Nothing to wash, apparently,” shesays.Rory wraps his arms around Hazelle. “We’ll be all right.”I take a handful of money from my pocket and lay it on the table. “My motherwill send something for Posy.”When we’re outside, I turn to Peeta. “You go on back. I want to walk by theHob.”“I’ll go with you,” he says.“No. I’ve dragged you into enough trouble,” I tell him.“And avoiding a stroll by the Hob . . . that’s going to fix things for me?” Hesmiles and takes my hand. Together we wind through the streets of the Seam untilwe reach the burning building. They haven’t even bothered to leave Peacekeepersaround it. They know no one would try to save it.The heat from the flames melts the surrounding snow and a black trickle runsacross my shoes. “It’s all that coal dust, from the old days,” I say. It was inevery crack and crevice. Ground into the floorboards. It’s amazing the placedidn’t go up before. “I want to check on Greasy Sae.”“Not today, Katniss. I don’t think we’d be helping anyone by dropping in onthem,” he says.We go back to the square. I buy some cakes from Peeta’s father while theyexchange small talk about the weather. No one mentions the ugly tools of torturejust yards from the front door. The last thing I notice as we leave the squareis that I do not recognize even one of the Peacekeepers’ faces.As the days pass, things go from bad to worse. The mines stay shut for twoweeks, and by that time half of District 12 is starving. The number of kidssigning up for tesserae soars, but they often don’t receive their grain. Foodshortages begin, and even those with money come away from stores empty-handed.When the mines reopen, wages are cut, hours extended, miners sent into blatantlydangerous work sites. The eagerly awaited food promised for Parcel Day arrivesspoiled and defiled by rodents. The installations in the square see plenty ofaction as people are dragged in and punished for offenses so long overlookedwe’ve forgotten they are illegal.Gale goes home with no more talk of rebellion between us. But I can’t helpthinking that everything he sees will only strengthen his resolve to fight back.The hardships in the mines, the tortured bodies in the square, the hunger on thefaces of his family. Rory has signed up for tesserae, something Gale can’t evenspeak about, but it’s still not enough with the inconsistent availability andthe ever-increasing price of food.The only bright spot is, I get Haymitch to hire Hazelle as a housekeeper,resulting in some extra money for her and greatly increasing Haymitch’s standardof living. It’s weird going into his house, finding it fresh and clean, foodwarming on the stove. He hardly notices because he’s fighting a whole differentbattle. Peeta and I tried to ration what white liquor we had, but it’s almostrun out, and the last time I saw Ripper, she was in the stocks.I feel like a pariah when I walk through the streets. Everyone avoids me inpublic now. But there’s no shortage of company at home. A steady supply of illand injured is deposited in our kitchen before my mother, who has long sincestopped charging for her services. Her stocks of remedies are running so low,though, that soon all she’ll have to treat the patients with is snow.The woods, of course, are forbidden. Absolutely. No question. Even Gale doesn’tchallenge this now. But one morning, I do. And it isn’t the house full of thesick and dying, the bleeding backs, the gaunt-faced children, the marchingboots, or the omnipresent misery that drives me under the fence. It’s thearrival of a crate of wedding dresses one night with a note from Effie sayingthat President Snow approved these himself.The wedding. Is he really planning to go through with it? What, in his twistedbrain, will that achieve? Is it for the benefit of those in the Capitol? Awedding was promised, a wedding will be given. And then he’ll kill us? As alesson to the districts? I don’t know. I can’t make sense of it. I toss and turnin bed until I can’t stand it anymore. I have to get out of here. At least for afew hours.My hands dig around in my closet until I find the insulated winter gear Cinnamade for me for recreational use on the Victory Tour. Waterproof boots, asnowsuit that covers me from head to toe, thermal gloves. I love my old huntingstuff, but the trek I have in mind today is more suited to this high-techclothing. I tiptoe downstairs, load my game bag with food, and sneak out of thehouse. Slinking along side streets and back alleys, I make my way to the weakspot in the fence closest to Rooba the butcher’s. Since many workers cross thisway to get to the mines, the snow’s pockmarked with footprints. Mine will not benoticed. With all his security upgrades, Thread has paid little attention to thefence, perhaps feeling harsh weather and wild animals are enough to keepeveryone safely inside. Even so, once I’m under the chain link, I cover mytracks until the trees conceal them for me.Dawn is just breaking as I retrieve a set of bow and arrows and begin to force apath through the drifted snow in the woods. I’m determined, for some reason, toget to the lake. Maybe to say good-bye to the place, to my father and the happytimes we spent there, because I know I’ll probably never return. Maybe just so Ican draw a complete breath again. Part of me doesn’t really care if they catchme, if I can see it one more time.The trip takes twice as long as usual. Cinna’s clothes hold in the heat allright, and I arrive soaked with sweat under the snowsuit while my face is numbwith cold. The glare of the winter sun off the snow has played games with myvision, and I am so exhausted and wrapped up in my own hopeless thoughts that Idon’t notice the signs. The thin stream of smoke from the chimney, theindentations of recent footprints, the smell of steaming pine needles. I amliterally a few yards from the door of the cement house when I pull up short.And that’s not because of the smoke or the prints or the smell. That’s becauseof the unmistakable click of a weapon behind me.Second nature. Instinct. I turn, drawing back the arrow, although I know alreadythat the odds are not in my favor. I see the white Peacekeeper uniform, thepointed chin, the light brown iris where my arrow will find a home. But theweapon is dropping to the ground and the unarmed woman is holding something outto me in her gloved hand.“Stop!” she cries.I waver, unable to process this turn in events. Perhaps they have orders tobring me in alive so they can torture me into incriminating every person I everknew. Yeah, good luck with that, I think. My fingers have all but decided torelease the arrow when I see the object in the glove. It’s a small white circleof flat bread. More of a cracker, really. Gray and soggy around the edges. Butan image is clearly stamped in the center of it.It’s my mockingjay."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00027.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00032.jpg]It makes no sense. My bird baked into bread. Unlike the stylish renderings I sawin the Capitol, this is definitely not a fashion statement. “What is it? Whatdoes that mean?” I ask harshly, still prepared to kill.“It means we’re on your side,” says a tremulous voice behind me.I didn’t see her when I came up. She must have been in the house. I don’t takemy eyes off my current target. Probably the newcomer is armed, but I’m bettingshe won’t risk letting me hear the click that would mean my death was imminent,knowing I would instantly kill her companion. “Come around where I can see you,”I order.“She can’t, she’s —” begins the woman with the cracker.“Come around!” I shout. There’s a step and a dragging sound. I can hear theeffort the movement requires. Another woman, or maybe I should call her a girlsince she looks about my age, limps into view. She’s dressed in an ill-fittingPeacekeeper’s uniform complete with the white fur cloak, but it’s several sizestoo large for her slight frame. She carries no visible weapon. Her hands areoccupied with steadying a rough crutch made from a broken branch. The toe of herright boot can’t clear the snow, hence the dragging.I examine the girl’s face, which is bright red from the cold. Her teeth arecrooked and there’s a strawberry birthmark over one of her chocolate brown eyes.This is no Peacekeeper. No citizen of the Capitol, either.“Who are you?” I ask warily but less belligerently.“My name’s Twill,” says the woman. She’s older. Maybe thirty-five or so. “Andthis is Bonnie. We’ve run away from District Eight.”District 8! Then they must know about the uprising!“Where’d you get the uniforms?” I ask.“I stole them from the factory,” says Bonnie. “We make them there. Only Ithought this one would be for . . . for someone else. That’s why it fits sopoorly.”“The gun came from a dead Peacekeeper,” says Twill, following my eyes.“That cracker in your hand. With the bird. What’s that about?” I ask.“Don’t you know, Katniss?” Bonnie appears genuinely surprised.They recognize me. Of course they recognize me. My face is uncovered and I’mstanding here outside of District 12 pointing an arrow at them. Who else would Ibe? “I know it matches the pin I wore in the arena.”“She doesn’t know,” says Bonnie softly. “Maybe not about any of it.”Suddenly I feel the need to appear on top of things. “I know you had an uprisingin Eight.”“Yes, that’s why we had to get out,” says Twill.“Well, you’re good and out now. What are you going to do?” I ask.“We’re headed for District Thirteen,” Twill replies.“Thirteen?” I say. “There’s no Thirteen. It got blown off the map.”“Seventy-five years ago,” says Twill.Bonnie shifts on her crutch and winces.“What’s wrong with your leg?” I ask.“I twisted my ankle. My boots are too big,” says Bonnie.I bite my lip. My instinct tells me they’re telling the truth. And behind thattruth is a whole lot of information I’d like to get. I step forward and retrieveTwill’s gun before lowering my bow, though. Then I hesitate a moment, thinkingof another day in this woods, when Gale and I watched a hovercraft appear out ofthin air and capture two escapees from the Capitol. The boy was speared andkilled. The redheaded girl, I found out when I went to the Capitol, wasmutilated and turned into a mute servant called an Avox. “Anyone after you?”“We don’t think so. We think they believe we were killed in a factoryexplosion,” says Twill. “Only a fluke that we weren’t.”“All right, let’s go inside,” I say, nodding at the cement house. I follow themin, carrying the gun.Bonnie makes straight for the hearth and lowers herself onto a Peacekeeper’scloak that has been spread before it. She holds her hands to the feeble flamethat burns on one end of a charred log. Her skin is so pale as to be translucentand I can see the fire glow through her flesh. Twill tries to arrange the cloak,which must have been her own, around the shivering girl.A tin gallon can has been cut in half, the lip ragged and dangerous. It sits inthe ashes, filled with a handful of pine needles steaming in water.“Making tea?” I ask.“We’re not sure, really. I remember seeing someone do this with pine needles onthe Hunger Games a few years back. At least, I think it was pine needles,” saysTwill with a frown.I remember District 8, an ugly urban place stinking of industrial fumes, thepeople housed in run-down tenements. Barely a blade of grass in sight. Noopportunity, ever, to learn the ways of nature. It’s a miracle these two havemade it this far.“Out of food?” I ask.Bonnie nods. “We took what we could, but food’s been so scarce. That’s been gonefor a while.” The quaver in her voice melts my remaining defenses. She is just amalnourished, injured girl fleeing the Capitol.“Well, then this is your lucky day,” I say, dropping my game bag on the floor.People are starving all over the district and we still have more than enough. SoI’ve been spreading things around a little. I have my own priorities: Gale’sfamily, Greasy Sae, some of the other Hob traders who were shut down. My motherhas other people, patients mostly, who she wants to help. This morning Ipurposely overstuffed my game bag with food, knowing my mother would see thedepleted pantry and assume I was making my rounds to the hungry. I was actuallybuying time to go to the lake without her worrying. I intended to deliver thefood this evening on my return, but now I can see that won’t be happening.From the bag I pull two fresh buns with a layer of cheese baked into the top. Wealways seem to have a supply of these since Peeta found out they were myfavorite. I toss one to Twill but cross over and place the other on Bonnie’s lapsince her hand-eye coordination seems a little questionable at the moment and Idon’t want the thing ending up in the fire.“Oh,” says Bonnie. “Oh, is this all for me?”Something inside me twists as I remember another voice. Rue. In the arena. WhenI gave her the leg of groosling. “Oh, I’ve never had a whole leg to myselfbefore.” The disbelief of the chronically hungry.“Yeah, eat up,” I say. Bonnie holds the bun as if she can’t quite believe it’sreal and then sinks her teeth into it again and again, unable to stop. “It’sbetter if you chew it.” She nods, trying to slow down, but I know how hard it iswhen you’re that hollow. “I think your tea’s done.” I scoot the tin can from theashes. Twill finds two tin cups in her pack and I dip out the tea, setting it onthe floor to cool. They huddle together, eating, blowing on their tea, andtaking tiny, scalding sips as I build up the fire. I wait until they are suckingthe grease from their fingers to ask, “So, what’s your story?” And they tell me.Ever since the Hunger Games, the discontent in District 8 had been growing. Itwas always there, of course, to some degree. But what differed was that talk wasno longer sufficient, and the idea of taking action went from a wish to areality. The textile factories that service Panem are loud with machinery, andthe din also allowed word to pass safely, a pair of lips close to an ear, wordsunnoticed, unchecked. Twill taught at school, Bonnie was one of her pupils, andwhen the final bell had rung, both of them spent a four-hour shift at thefactory that specialized in the Peacekeeper uniforms. It took months for Bonnie,who worked in the chilly inspection dock, to secure the two uniforms, a boothere, a pair of pants there. They were intended for Twill and her husbandbecause it was understood that, once the uprising began, it would be crucial toget word of it out beyond District 8 if it were to spread and be successful.The day Peeta and I came through and made our Victory Tour appearance wasactually a rehearsal of sorts. People in the crowd positioned themselvesaccording to their teams, next to the buildings they would target when therebellion broke out. That was the plan: to take over the centers of power in thecity like the Justice Building, the Peacekeepers’ Headquarters, and theCommunication Center in the square. And at other locations in the district: therailroad, the granary, the power station, and the armory.The night of my engagement, the night Peeta fell to his knees and proclaimed hisundying love for me in front of the cameras in the Capitol, was the night theuprising began. It was an ideal cover. Our Victory Tour interview with CaesarFlickerman was mandatory viewing. It gave the people of District 8 a reason tobe out on the streets after dark, gathering either in the square or in variouscommunity centers around the city to watch. Ordinarily such activity would havebeen too suspicious. Instead everyone was in place by the appointed hour, eighto’clock, when the masks went on and all hell broke loose.Taken by surprise and overwhelmed by sheer numbers, the Peacekeepers wereinitially overcome by the crowds. The Communication Center, the granary, and thepower station were all secured. As the Peacekeepers fell, weapons wereappropriated for the rebels. There was hope that this had not been an act ofmadness, that in some way, if they could get the word out to other districts, anactual overthrow of the government in the Capitol might be possible.But then the ax fell. Peacekeepers began to arrive by the thousands. Hovercraftbombed the rebel strongholds into ashes. In the utter chaos that followed, itwas all people could do to make it back to their homes alive. It took less thanforty-eight hours to subdue the city. Then, for a week, there was a lockdown. Nofood, no coal, everyone forbidden to leave their homes. The only time thetelevision showed anything but static was when the suspected instigators werehanged in the square. Then one night, as the whole district was on the brink ofstarvation, came the order to return to business as usual.That meant school for Twill and Bonnie. A street made impassable by the bombscaused them to be late for their factory shift, so they were still a hundredyards away when it exploded, killing everyone inside — including Twill’s husbandand Bonnie’s entire family.“Someone must have told the Capitol that the idea for the uprising had startedthere,” Twill tells me faintly.The two fled back to Twill’s, where the Peacekeeper suits were still waiting.They scraped together what provisions they could, stealing freely from neighborsthey now knew to be dead, and made it to the railroad station. In a warehousenear the tracks, they changed into the Peacekeeper outfits and, disguised, wereable to make it onto a boxcar full of fabric on a train headed to District 6.They fled the train at a fuel stop along the way and traveled on foot. Concealedby woods, but using the tracks for guidance, they made it to the outskirts ofDistrict 12 two days ago, where they were forced to stop when Bonnie twisted herankle.“I understand why you’re running, but what do you expect to find in DistrictThirteen?” I ask.Bonnie and Twill exchange a nervous glance. “We’re not sure exactly,” Twillsays.“It’s nothing but rubble,” I say. “We’ve all seen the footage.”“That’s just it. They’ve been using the same footage for as long as anyone inDistrict Eight can remember,” says Twill.“Really?” I try to think back, to call up the images of 13 I’ve seen ontelevision.“You know how they always show the Justice Building?” Twill continues. I nod.I’ve seen it a thousand times. “If you look very carefully, you’ll see it. Up inthe far right-hand corner.”“See what?” I ask.Twill holds out her cracker with the bird again. “A mockingjay. Just a glimpseof it as it flies by. The same one every time.”“Back home, we think they keep reusing the old footage because the Capitol can’tshow what’s really there now,” says Bonnie.I give a grunt of disbelief. “You’re going to District Thirteen based on that? Ashot of a bird? You think you’re going to find some new city with peoplestrolling around in it? And that’s just fine with the Capitol?”“No,” Twill says earnestly. “We think the people moved underground wheneverything on the surface was destroyed. We think they’ve managed to survive.And we think the Capitol leaves them alone because, before the Dark Days,District Thirteen’s principal industry was nuclear development.”“They were graphite miners,” I say. But then I hesitate, because that’sinformation I got from the Capitol.“They had a few small mines, yes. But not enough to justify a population of thatsize. That, I guess, is the only thing we know for sure,” says Twill.My heart’s beating too quickly. What if they’re right? Could it be true? Couldthere be somewhere to run besides the wilderness? Somewhere safe? If a communityexists in District 13, would it be better to go there, where I might be able toaccomplish something, instead of waiting here for my death? But then . . . ifthere are people in District 13, with powerful weapons . . .“Why haven’t they helped us?” I say angrily. “If it’s true, why do they leave usto live like this? With the hunger and the killings and the Games?” And suddenlyI hate this imaginary underground city of District 13 and those who sit by,watching us die. They’re no better than the Capitol.“We don’t know,” Bonnie whispers. “Right now, we’re just holding on to the hopethat they exist.”That snaps me to my senses. These are delusions. District 13 doesn’t existbecause the Capitol would never let it exist. They’re probably mistaken aboutthe footage. Mockingjays are about as rare as rocks. And about as tough. If theycould survive the initial bombing of 13, they’re probably doing better than evernow.Bonnie has no home. Her family is dead. Returning to District 8 or assimilatinginto another district would be impossible. Of course the idea of an independent,thriving District 13 draws her. I can’t bring myself to tell her she’s chasing adream as insubstantial as a wisp of smoke. Perhaps she and Twill can carve out alife somehow in the woods. I doubt it, but they’re so pitiful I have to try tohelp.First I give them all the food in my pack, grain and dried beans mostly, butthere’s enough to hold them for a while if they’re careful. Then I take Twillout in the woods and try to explain the basics of hunting. She’s got a weaponthat if necessary can convert solar energy into deadly rays of power, so thatcould last indefinitely. When she manages to kill her first squirrel, the poorthing is mostly a charred mess because it took a direct hit to the body. But Ishow her how to skin and clean it. With some practice, she’ll figure it out. Icut a new crutch for Bonnie. Back at the house, I peel off an extra layer ofsocks for the girl, telling her to stuff them in the toes of her boots to walk,then wear them on her feet at night. Finally I teach them how to build a properfire.They beg me for details of the situation in District 12 and I tell them aboutlife under Thread. I can see they think this is important information thatthey’ll be bringing to those who run District 13, and I play along so as not todestroy their hopes. But when the light signals late afternoon, I’m out of timeto humor them.“I have to go now,” I say.They pour out thanks and embrace me.Tears spill from Bonnie’s eyes. “I can’t believe we actually got to meet you.You’re practically all anyone’s talked about since —”“I know. I know. Since I pulled out those berries,” I say tiredly.I hardly notice the walk home even though a wet snow begins to fall. My mind isspinning with new information about the uprising in District 8 and the unlikelybut tantalizing possibility of District 13.Listening to Bonnie and Twill confirmed one thing: President Snow has beenplaying me for a fool. All the kisses and endearments in the world couldn’t havederailed the momentum building up in District 8. Yes, my holding out the berrieshad been the spark, but I had no way to control the fire. He must have knownthat. So why visit my home, why order me to persuade the crowd of my love forPeeta? It was obviously a ploy to distract me and keep me from doing anythingelse inflammatory in the districts. And to entertain the people in the Capitol,of course. I suppose the wedding is just a necessary extension of that.I’m nearing the fence when a mockingjay lights on a branch and trills at me. Atthe sight of it I realize I never got a full explanation of the bird on thecracker and what it signifies.“It means we’re on your side.” That’s what Bonnie said. I have people on myside? What side? Am I unwittingly the face of the hoped-for rebellion? Has themockingjay on my pin become a symbol of resistance? If so, my side’s not doingtoo well. You only have to look at what happened in 8 to know that.I stash my weapons in the hollow log nearest my old home in the Seam and headfor the fence. I’m crouched on one knee, preparing to enter the Meadow, but I’mstill so preoccupied with the day’s events that it takes a sudden screech of anowl to bring me to my senses.In the fading light, the chain links look as innocuous as usual. But what makesme jerk back my hand is the sound, like the buzz of a tree full of trackerjacker nests, indicating the fence is alive with electricity."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00036.jpg]My feet back up automatically and I blend into the trees. I cover my mouth withmy glove to disperse the white of my breath in the icy air. Adrenaline coursesthrough me, wiping all the concerns of the day from my mind as I focus on theimmediate threat before me. What is going on? Has Thread turned on the fence asan additional security precaution? Or does he somehow know I’ve escaped his nettoday? Is he determined to strand me outside District 12 until he can apprehendand arrest me? Drag me to the square to be locked in the stockade or whipped orhanged?Calm down, I order myself. It’s not as if this is the first time I’ve beencaught outside of the district by an electrified fence. It’s happened a fewtimes over the years, but Gale was always with me. The two of us would just picka comfortable tree to hang out in until the power shut off, which it always dideventually. If I was running late, Prim even got in the habit of going to theMeadow to check if the fence was charged, to spare my mother worry.But today my family would never imagine I’d be in the woods. I’ve even takensteps to mislead them. So if I don’t show up, worry they will. And there’s apart of me that’s worried, too, because I’m not sure it’s just a coincidence,the power coming on the very day I return to the woods. I thought no one saw mesneak under the fence, but who knows? There are always eyes for hire. Someonereported Gale kissing me in that very spot. Still, that was in daylight andbefore I was more careful about my behavior. Could there be surveillancecameras? I’ve wondered about this before. Is this the way President Snow knowsabout the kiss? It was dark when I went under and my face was bundled in ascarf. But the list of suspects likely to be trespassing into the woods isprobably very short.My eyes peer through the trees, past the fence, into the Meadow. All I can seeis the wet snow illuminated here and there by the light from the windows on theedge of the Seam. No Peacekeepers in sight, no signs I am being hunted. WhetherThread knows I left the district today or not, I realize my course of actionmust be the same: to get back inside the fence unseen and pretend I never left.Any contact with the chain link or the coils of barbed wire that guard the topwould mean instant electrocution. I don’t think I can burrow under the fencewithout risking detection, and the ground’s frozen hard, anyway. That leavesonly one choice. Somehow I’m going to have to go over it.I begin to skirt along the tree line, searching for a tree with a branch highand long enough to fit my needs. After about a mile, I come upon an old maplethat might do. The trunk is too wide and icy to shinny up, though, and there areno low branches. I climb a neighboring tree and leap precariously into themaple, almost losing my hold on the slick bark. But I manage to get a grip andslowly inch my way out on a limb that hangs above the barbed wire.As I look down, I remember why Gale and I always waited in the woods rather thantry to tackle the fence. Being high enough to avoid getting fried means you’vegot to be at least twenty feet in the air. I guess my branch must betwenty-five. That’s a dangerously long drop, even for someone who’s had years ofpractice in trees. But what choice do I have? I could look for another branch,but it’s almost dark now. The falling snow will obscure any moonlight. Here, atleast, I can see I’ve got a snowbank to cushion my landing. Even if I could findanother, which is doubtful, who knows what I’d be jumping into? I throw my emptygame bag around my neck and slowly lower myself until I’m hanging by my hands.For a moment, I gather my courage. Then I release my fingers.There’s the sensation of falling, then I hit the ground with a jolt that goesright up my spine. A second later, my rear end slams the ground. I lie in thesnow, trying to assess the damage. Without standing, I can tell by the pain inmy left heel and my tailbone that I’m injured. The only question is how badly.I’m hoping for bruises, but when I force myself onto my feet, I suspect I’vebroken something as well. I can walk, though, so I get moving, trying to hide mylimp as best I can.My mother and Prim can’t know I was in the woods. I need to work up some sort ofalibi, no matter how thin. Some of the shops in the square are still open, so Igo in one and purchase white cloth for bandages. We’re running low, anyway. Inanother, I buy a bag of sweets for Prim. I stick one of the candies in my mouth,feeling the peppermint melt on my tongue, and realize it’s the first thing I’veeaten all day. I meant to make a meal at the lake, but once I saw Twill andBonnie’s condition, it seemed wrong to take a single mouthful from them.By the time I reach my house, my left heel will bear no weight at all. I decideto tell my mother I was trying to mend a leak in the roof of our old house andslid off. As for the missing food, I’ll just be vague about who I handed it outto. I drag myself in the door, all ready to collapse in front of the fire. Butinstead I get another shock.Two Peacekeepers, a man and a woman, are standing in the doorway to our kitchen.The woman remains impassive, but I catch the flicker of surprise on the man’sface. I am unanticipated. They know I was in the woods and should be trappedthere now.“Hello,” I say in a neutral voice.My mother appears behind them, but keeps her distance. “Here she is, just intime for dinner,” she says a little too brightly. I’m very late for dinner.I consider removing my boots as I normally would but doubt I can manage itwithout revealing my injuries. Instead I just pull off my wet hood and shake thesnow from my hair. “Can I help you with something?” I ask the Peacekeepers.“Head Peacekeeper Thread sent us with a message for you,” says the woman.“They’ve been waiting for hours,” my mother adds.They’ve been waiting for me to fail to return. To confirm I got electrocuted bythe fence or trapped in the woods so they could take my family in forquestioning.“Must be an important message,” I say.“May we ask where you’ve been, Miss Everdeen?” the woman asks.“Easier to ask where I haven’t been,” I say with a sound of exasperation. Icross into the kitchen, forcing myself to use my foot normally even though everystep is excruciating. I pass between the Peacekeepers and make it to the tableall right. I fling my bag down and turn to Prim, who’s standing stiffly by thehearth. Haymitch and Peeta are there as well, sitting in a pair of matchingrockers, playing a game of chess. Were they here by chance or “invited” by thePeacekeepers? Either way, I’m glad to see them.“So where haven’t you been?” says Haymitch in a bored voice.“Well, I haven’t been talking to the Goat Man about getting Prim’s goatpregnant, because someone gave me completely inaccurate information as to wherehe lives,” I say to Prim emphatically.“No, I didn’t,” says Prim. “I told you exactly.”“You said he lives beside the west entrance to the mine,” I say.“The east entrance,” Prim corrects me.“You distinctly said the west, because then I said, ‘Next to the slag heap?’ andyou said, ‘Yeah,’ ” I say.“The slag heap next to the east entrance,” says Prim patiently.“No. When did you say that?” I demand.“Last night,” Haymitch chimes in.“It was definitely the east,” adds Peeta. He looks at Haymitch and they laugh. Iglare at Peeta and he tries to look contrite. “I’m sorry, but it’s what I’vebeen saying. You don’t listen when people talk to you.”“Bet people told you he didn’t live there today and you didn’t listen again,”says Haymitch.“Shut up, Haymitch,” I say, clearly indicating he’s right.Haymitch and Peeta crack up and Prim allows herself a smile.“Fine. Somebody else can arrange to get the stupid goat knocked up,” I say,which makes them laugh more. And I think, This is why they’ve made it this far,Haymitch and Peeta. Nothing throws them.I look at the Peacekeepers. The man’s smiling but the woman is unconvinced.“What’s in the bag?” she asks sharply.I know she’s hoping for game or wild plants. Something that clearly condemns me.I dump the contents on the table. “See for yourself.”“Oh, good,” says my mother, examining the cloth. “We’re running low onbandages.”Peeta comes to the table and opens the candy bag. “Ooh, peppermints,” he says,popping one in his mouth.“They’re mine.” I take a swipe for the bag. He tosses it to Haymitch, who stuffsa fistful of sweets in his mouth before passing the bag to a giggling Prim.“None of you deserves candy!” I say.“What, because we’re right?” Peeta wraps his arms around me. I give a small yelpof pain as my tailbone objects. I try to turn it into a sound of indignation,but I can see in his eyes that he knows I’m hurt. “Okay, Prim said west. Idistinctly heard west. And we’re all idiots. How’s that?”“Better,” I say, and accept his kiss. Then I look at the Peacekeepers as if I’msuddenly remembering they’re there. “You have a message for me?”“From Head Peacekeeper Thread,” says the woman. “He wanted you to know that thefence surrounding District Twelve will now have electricity twenty-four hours aday.”“Didn’t it already?” I ask, a little too innocently.“He thought you might be interested in passing this information on to yourcousin,” says the woman.“Thank you. I’ll tell him. I’m sure we’ll all sleep a little more soundly nowthat security has addressed that lapse.” I’m pushing things, I know it, but thecomment gives me a sense of satisfaction.The woman’s jaw tightens. None of this has gone as planned, but she has nofurther orders. She gives me a curt nod and leaves, the man trailing in herwake. When my mother has locked the door behind them, I slump against the table.“What is it?” says Peeta, holding me steadily.“Oh, I banged up my left foot. The heel. And my tailbone’s had a bad day, too.”He helps me over to one of the rockers and I lower myself onto the paddedcushion.My mother eases off my boots. “What happened?”“I slipped and fell,” I say. Four pairs of eyes look at me with disbelief. “Onsome ice.” But we all know the house must be bugged and it’s not safe to talkopenly. Not here, not now.Having stripped off my sock, my mother’s fingers probe the bones in my left heeland I wince. “There might be a break,” she says. She checks the other foot.“This one seems all right.” She judges my tailbone to be badly bruised.Prim’s dispatched to get my pajamas and robe. When I’m changed, my mother makesa snow pack for my left heel and props it up on a hassock. I eat three bowls ofstew and half a loaf of bread while the others dine at the table. I stare at thefire, thinking of Bonnie and Twill, hoping that the heavy, wet snow has erasedmy tracks.Prim comes and sits on the floor next to me, leaning her head against my knee.We suck on peppermints as I brush her soft blond hair back behind her ear. “Howwas school?” I ask.“All right. We learned about coal by-products,” she says. We stare at the firefor a while. “Are you going to try on your wedding dresses?”“Not tonight. Tomorrow probably,” I say.“Wait until I get home, okay?” she says.“Sure.” If they don’t arrest me first.My mother gives me a cup of chamomile tea with a dose of sleep syrup, and myeyelids begin to droop immediately. She wraps my bad foot, and Peeta volunteersto get me to bed. I start out by leaning on his shoulder, but I’m so wobbly hejust scoops me up and carries me upstairs. He tucks me in and says good nightbut I catch his hand and hold him there. A side effect of the sleep syrup isthat it makes people less inhibited, like white liquor, and I know I have tocontrol my tongue. But I don’t want him to go. In fact, I want him to climb inwith me, to be there when the nightmares hit tonight. For some reason that Ican’t quite form, I know I’m not allowed to ask that.“Don’t go yet. Not until I fall asleep,” I say.Peeta sits on the side of the bed, warming my hand in both of his. “Almostthought you’d changed your mind today. When you were late for dinner.”I’m foggy but I can guess what he means. With the fence going on and me showingup late and the Peacekeepers waiting, he thought I’d made a run for it, maybewith Gale.“No, I’d have told you,” I say. I pull his hand up and lean my cheek against theback of it, taking in the faint scent of cinnamon and dill from the breads hemust have baked today. I want to tell him about Twill and Bonnie and theuprising and the fantasy of District 13, but it’s not safe to and I can feelmyself slipping away, so I just get out one more sentence. “Stay with me.”As the tendrils of sleep syrup pull me down, I hear him whisper a word back, butI don’t quite catch it.My mother lets me sleep until noon, then rouses me to examine my heel. I’mordered to a week of bed rest and I don’t object because I feel so lousy. Notjust my heel and my tailbone. My whole body aches with exhaustion. So I let mymother doctor me and feed me breakfast in bed and tuck another quilt around me.Then I just lie there, staring out my window at the winter sky, pondering how onearth this will all turn out. I think a lot about Bonnie and Twill, and the pileof white wedding dresses downstairs, and if Thread will figure out how I gotback in and arrest me. It’s funny, because he could just arrest me, anyway,based on past crimes, but maybe he has to have something really irrefutable todo it, now that I’m a victor. And I wonder if President Snow’s in contact withThread. I think it’s unlikely he ever acknowledged that old Cray existed, butnow that I’m such a nationwide problem, is he carefully instructing Thread whatto do? Or is Thread acting on his own? At any rate, I’m sure they’d both agreeon keeping me locked up here inside the district with that fence. Even if Icould figure out some way to escape — maybe get a rope up to that maple treebranch and climb out — there’d be no escaping with my family and friends now. Itold Gale I would stay and fight, anyway.For the next few days, I jump every time there’s a knock on the door. NoPeacekeepers show up to arrest me, though, so eventually I begin to relax. I’mfurther reassured when Peeta casually tells me the power is off in sections ofthe fence because crews are out securing the base of the chain link to theground. Thread must believe I somehow got under the thing, even with that deadlycurrent running through it. It’s a break for the district, having thePeacekeepers busy doing something besides abusing people.Peeta comes by every day to bring me cheese buns and begins to help me work onthe family book. It’s an old thing, made of parchment and leather. Someherbalist on my mother’s side of the family started it ages ago. The book’scomposed of page after page of ink drawings of plants with descriptions of theirmedical uses. My father added a section on edible plants that was my guidebookto keeping us alive after his death. For a long time, I’ve wanted to record myown knowledge in it. Things I learned from experience or from Gale, and then theinformation I picked up when I was training for the Games. I didn’t because I’mno artist and it’s so crucial that the pictures are drawn in exact detail.That’s where Peeta comes in. Some of the plants he knows already, others we havedried samples of, and others I have to describe. He makes sketches on scrappaper until I’m satisfied they’re right, then I let him draw them in the book.After that, I carefully print all I know about the plant.It’s quiet, absorbing work that helps take my mind off my troubles. I like towatch his hands as he works, making a blank page bloom with strokes of ink,adding touches of color to our previously black and yellowish book. His facetakes on a special look when he concentrates. His usual easy expression isreplaced by something more intense and removed that suggests an entire worldlocked away inside him. I’ve seen flashes of this before: in the arena, or whenhe speaks to a crowd, or that time he shoved the Peacekeepers’ guns away from mein District 11. I don’t know quite what to make of it. I also become a littlefixated on his eyelashes, which ordinarily you don’t notice much because they’reso blond. But up close, in the sunlight slanting in from the window, they’re alight golden color and so long I don’t see how they keep from getting alltangled up when he blinks.One afternoon Peeta stops shading a blossom and looks up so suddenly that Istart, as though I were caught spying on him, which in a strange way maybe Iwas. But he only says, “You know, I think this is the first time we’ve ever doneanything normal together.”“Yeah,” I agree. Our whole relationship has been tainted by the Games. Normalwas never a part of it. “Nice for a change.”Each afternoon he carries me downstairs for a change of scenery and I unnerveeveryone by turning on the television. Usually we only watch when it’smandatory, because the mixture of propaganda and displays of the Capitol’s power— including clips from seventy-four years of Hunger Games — is so odious. Butnow I’m looking for something special. The mockingjay that Bonnie and Twill arebasing all their hopes on. I know it’s probably foolishness, but if it is, Iwant to rule it out. And erase the idea of a thriving District 13 from my mindfor good.My first sighting is in a news story referencing the Dark Days. I see thesmoldering remains of the Justice Building in District 13 and just catch theblack-and-white underside of a mockingjay’s wing as it flies across the upperright-hand corner. That doesn’t prove anything, really. It’s just an old shotthat goes with an old tale.However, several days later, something else grabs my attention. The mainnewscaster is reading a piece about a shortage of graphite affecting themanufacturing of items in District 3. They cut to what is supposed to be livefootage of a female reporter, encased in a protective suit, standing in front ofthe ruins of the Justice Building in 13. Through her mask, she reports thatunfortunately a study has just today determined that the mines of District 13are still too toxic to approach. End of story. But just before they cut back tothe main newscaster, I see the unmistakable flash of that same mockingjay’swing.The reporter has simply been incorporated into the old footage. She’s not inDistrict 13 at all. Which begs the question,"},{"pageContent":"What is?"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00003.jpg]Staying quietly in bed is harder after that. I want to be doing something,finding out more about District 13 or helping in the cause to bring down theCapitol. Instead I sit around stuffing myself with cheese buns and watchingPeeta sketch. Haymitch stops by occasionally to bring me news from town, whichis always bad. More people being punished or dropping from starvation.Winter has begun to withdraw by the time my foot is deemed usable. My mothergives me exercises to do and lets me walk on my own a bit. I go to sleep onenight, determined to go into town the next morning, but I awake to find Venia,Octavia, and Flavius grinning down at me.“Surprise!” they squeal. “We’re here early!”After I took that lash in the face, Haymitch got their visit pushed back severalmonths so I could heal up. I wasn’t expecting them for another three weeks. ButI try to act delighted that my bridal photo shoot is here at last. My motherhung up all the dresses, so they’re ready to go, but to be honest, I haven’teven tried one on.After the usual histrionics about the deteriorated state of my beauty, they getright down to business. Their biggest concern is my face, although I think mymother did a pretty remarkable job healing it. There’s just a pale pink stripacross my cheekbone. The whipping’s not common knowledge, so I tell them Islipped on the ice and cut it. And then I realize that’s my same excuse forhurting my foot, which is going to make walking in high heels a problem. ButFlavius, Octavia, and Venia aren’t the suspicious types, so I’m safe there.Since I only have to look hairless for a few hours instead of several weeks, Iget to be shaved instead of waxed. I still have to soak in a tub of something,but it isn’t vile, and we’re on to my hair and makeup before I know it. Theteam, as usual, is full of news, which I usually do my best to tune out. Butthen Octavia makes a comment that catches my attention. It’s a passing remark,really, about how she couldn’t get shrimp for a party, but it tugs at me.“Why couldn’t you get shrimp? Is it out of season?” I ask.“Oh, Katniss, we haven’t been able to get any seafood for weeks!” says Octavia.“You know, because the weather’s been so bad in District Four.”My mind starts buzzing. No seafood. For weeks. From District 4. The barelyconcealed rage in the crowd during the Victory Tour. And suddenly I amabsolutely sure that District 4 has revolted.I begin to question them casually about what other hardships this winter hasbrought them. They are not used to want, so any little disruption in supplymakes an impact on them. By the time I’m ready to be dressed, their complaintsabout the difficulty of getting different products — from crabmeat to musicchips to ribbons — has given me a sense of which districts might actually berebelling. Seafood from District 4. Electronic gadgets from District 3. And, ofcourse, fabrics from District 8. The thought of such widespread rebellion has mequivering with fear and excitement.I want to ask them more, but Cinna appears to give me a hug and check my makeup.His attention goes right to the scar on my cheek. Somehow I don’t think hebelieves the slipping-on-the-ice story, but he doesn’t question it. He simplyadjusts the powder on my face, and what little you can see of the lash markvanishes.Downstairs, the living room has been cleared and lit for the photo shoot.Effie’s having a fine time ordering everybody around, keeping us all onschedule. It’s probably a good thing, because there are six gowns and each onerequires its own headpiece, shoes, jewelry, hair, makeup, setting, and lighting.Creamy lace and pink roses and ringlets. Ivory satin and gold tattoos andgreenery. A sheath of diamonds and jeweled veil and moonlight. Heavy white silkand sleeves that fall from my wrist to the floor, and pearls. The moment oneshot has been approved, we move right into preparing for the next. I feel likedough, being kneaded and reshaped again and again. My mother manages to feed mebits of food and sips of tea while they work on me, but by the time the shoot isover, I’m starving and exhausted. I’m hoping to spend some time with Cinna now,but Effie whisks everybody out the door and I have to make do with the promiseof a phone call.Evening has fallen and my foot hurts from all the crazy shoes, so I abandon anythoughts of going into town. Instead I go upstairs and wash away the layers ofmakeup and conditioners and dyes and then go down to dry my hair by the fire.Prim, who came home from school in time to see the last two dresses, chatters onabout them with my mother. They both seem overly happy about the photo shoot.When I fall into bed, I realize it’s because they think it means I’m safe. Thatthe Capitol has overlooked my interference with the whipping since no one isgoing to go to such trouble and expense for someone they plan on killing,anyway. Right.In my nightmare, I’m dressed in the silk bridal gown, but it’s torn and muddy.The long sleeves keep getting caught on thorns and branches as I run through thewoods. The pack of muttation tributes draws closer and closer until it overcomesme with hot breath and dripping fangs and I scream myself awake.It’s too close to dawn to bother trying to get back to sleep. Besides, today Ireally have to get out and talk to someone. Gale will be unreachable in themines. But I need Haymitch or Peeta or somebody to share the burden of all thathas happened to me since I went to the lake. Fleeing outlaws, electrifiedfences, an independent District 13, shortages in the Capitol. Everything.I eat breakfast with my mother and Prim and head out in search of a confidant.The air’s warm with hopeful hints of spring in it. Spring would be a good timefor an uprising, I think. Everyone feels less vulnerable once winter passes.Peeta’s not home. I guess he’s already gone into town. I’m surprised to seeHaymitch moving around his kitchen so early, though. I walk into his housewithout knocking. I can hear Hazelle upstairs, sweeping the floors of thenow-spotless house. Haymitch isn’t flat-out drunk, but he doesn’t look toosteady, either. I guess the rumors about Ripper being back in business are true.I’m thinking maybe I better let him just go to bed, when he suggests a walk totown.Haymitch and I can speak in a kind of shorthand now. In a few minutes I’veupdated him and he’s told me about rumors of uprisings in Districts 7 and 11 aswell. If my hunches are right, this would mean almost half the districts have atleast attempted to rebel.“Do you still think it won’t work here?” I ask.“Not yet. Those other districts, they’re much larger. Even if half the peoplecower in their homes, the rebels stand a chance. Here in Twelve, it’s got to beall of us or nothing,” he says.I hadn’t thought of that. How we lack strength of numbers. “But maybe at somepoint?” I insist.“Maybe. But we’re small, we’re weak, and we don’t develop nuclear weapons,” saysHaymitch with a touch of sarcasm. He didn’t get too excited over my District 13story.“What do you think they’ll do, Haymitch? To the districts that are rebelling?” Iask.“Well, you’ve heard what they did in Eight. You’ve seen what they did here, andthat was without provocation,” says Haymitch. “If things really do get out ofhand, I think they’d have no problem killing off another district, same as theydid Thirteen. Make an example of it, you know?”“So you think Thirteen was really destroyed? I mean, Bonnie and Twill were rightabout the footage of the mockingjay,” I say.“Okay, but what does that prove? Nothing, really. There are plenty of reasonsthey could be using old footage. Probably it looks more impressive. And it’s alot simpler, isn’t it? To just press a few buttons in the editing room than tofly all the way out there and film it?” he says. “The idea that Thirteen hassomehow rebounded and the Capitol is ignoring it? That sounds like the kind ofrumor desperate people cling to.”“I know. I was just hoping,” I say.“Exactly. Because you’re desperate,” says Haymitch.I don’t argue because, of course, he’s right.Prim comes home from school bubbling over with excitement. The teachersannounced there was mandatory programming tonight. “I think it’s going to beyour photo shoot!”“It can’t be, Prim. They only did the pictures yesterday,” I tell her.“Well, that’s what somebody heard,” she says.I’m hoping she’s wrong. I haven’t had time to prepare Gale for any of this.Since the whipping, I only see him when he comes to the house for my mother tocheck how he’s healing. He’s often scheduled seven days a week in the mine. Inthe few minutes of privacy we’ve had, with me walking him back to town, I gatherthat the rumblings of an uprising in 12 have been subdued by Thread’s crackdown.He knows I’m not going to run. But he must also know that if we don’t revolt in12, I’m destined to be Peeta’s bride. Seeing me lounging around in gorgeousgowns on his television . . . what can he do with that?When we gather around the television at seven-thirty, I discover that Prim isright. Sure enough, there’s Caesar Flickerman, speaking before astanding-room-only crowd in front of the Training Center, talking to anappreciative crowd about my upcoming nuptials. He introduces Cinna, who becamean overnight star with his costumes for me in the Games, and after a minute ofgood-natured chitchat, we’re directed to turn our attention to a giant screen.I see now how they could photograph me yesterday and present the specialtonight. Initially, Cinna designed two dozen wedding gowns. Since then, there’sbeen the process of narrowing down the designs, creating the dresses, andchoosing the accessories. Apparently, in the Capitol, there were opportunitiesto vote for your favorites at each stage. This is all culminating with shots ofme in the final six dresses, which I’m sure took no time at all to insert in theshow. Each shot is met with a huge reaction from the crowd. People screaming andcheering for their favorites, booing the ones they don’t like. Having voted, andprobably bet on the winner, people are very invested in my wedding gown. It’sbizarre to watch when I think how I never even bothered to try one on before thecameras arrived. Caesar announces that interested parties must cast their finalvote by noon on the following day.“Let’s get Katniss Everdeen to her wedding in style!” he hollers to the crowd.I’m about to shut off the television, but then Caesar is telling us to staytuned for the other big event of the evening. “That’s right, this year will bethe seventy-fifth anniversary of the Hunger Games, and that means it’s time forour third Quarter Quell!”“What will they do?” asks Prim. “It isn’t for months yet.”We turn to our mother, whose expression is solemn and distant, as if she’sremembering something. “It must be the reading of the card.”The anthem plays, and my throat tightens with revulsion as President Snow takesthe stage. He’s followed by a young boy dressed in a white suit, holding asimple wooden box. The anthem ends, and President Snow begins to speak, toremind us all of the Dark Days from which the Hunger Games were born. When thelaws for the Games were laid out, they dictated that every twenty-five years theanniversary would be marked by a Quarter Quell. It would call for a glorifiedversion of the Games to make fresh the memory of those killed by the districts’rebellion.These words could not be more pointed, since I suspect several districts arerebelling right now.President Snow goes on to tell us what happened in the previous Quarter Quells.“On the twenty-fifth anniversary, as a reminder to the rebels that theirchildren were dying because of their choice to initiate violence, every districtwas made to hold an election and vote on the tributes who would represent it.”I wonder how that would have felt. Picking the kids who had to go. It is worse,I think, to be turned over by your own neighbors than have your name drawn fromthe reaping ball.“On the fiftieth anniversary,” the president continues, “as a reminder that tworebels died for each Capitol citizen, every district was required to send twiceas many tributes.”I imagine facing a field of forty-seven instead of twenty-three. Worse odds,less hope, and ultimately more dead kids. That was the year Haymitch won. . . .“I had a friend who went that year,” says my mother quietly. “Maysilee Donner.Her parents owned the sweetshop. They gave me her songbird after. A canary.”Prim and I exchange a look. It’s the first we’ve ever heard of Maysilee Donner.Maybe because my mother knew we would want to know how she died.“And now we honor our third Quarter Quell,” says the president. The little boyin white steps forward, holding out the box as he opens the lid. We can see thetidy, upright rows of yellowed envelopes. Whoever devised the Quarter Quellsystem had prepared for centuries of Hunger Games. The president removes anenvelope clearly marked with a 75. He runs his finger under the flap and pullsout a small square of paper. Without hesitation, he reads, “On the seventy-fifthanniversary, as a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among themcannot overcome the power of the Capitol, the male and female tributes will bereaped from their existing pool of victors.”My mother gives a faint shriek and Prim buries her face in her hands, but I feelmore like the people I see in the crowd on television. Slightly baffled. Whatdoes it mean? Existing pool of victors?Then I get it, what it means. At least, for me. District 12 only has threeexisting victors to choose from. Two male. One female . . .I am going back into the arena."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00006.jpg]My body reacts before my mind does and I’m running out the door, across thelawns of the Victor’s Village, into the dark beyond. Moisture from the soddenground soaks my socks and I’m aware of the sharp bite of the wind, but I don’tstop. Where? Where to go? The woods, of course. I’m at the fence before the hummakes me remember how very trapped I am. I back away, panting, turn on my heel,and take off again.The next thing I know I’m on my hands and knees in the cellar of one of theempty houses in the Victor’s Village. Faint shafts of moonlight come in throughthe window wells above my head. I’m cold and wet and winded, but my escapeattempt has done nothing to subdue the hysteria rising up inside me. It willdrown me unless it’s released. I ball up the front of my shirt, stuff it into mymouth, and begin to scream. How long this continues, I don’t know. But when Istop, my voice is almost gone.I curl up on my side and stare at the patches of moonlight on the cement floor.Back in the arena. Back in the place of nightmares. That’s where I am going. Ihave to admit I didn’t see it coming. I saw a multitude of other things. Beingpublicly humiliated, tortured, and executed. Fleeing through the wilderness,pursued by Peacekeepers and hovercraft. Marriage to Peeta with our childrenforced into the arena. But never that I myself would have to be a player in theGames again. Why? Because there’s no precedent for it. Victors are out of thereaping for life. That’s the deal if you win. Until now.There’s some kind of sheeting, the kind they put down when they paint. I pull itover me like a blanket. In the distance, someone is calling my name. But at themoment, I excuse myself from thinking about even those I love most. I think onlyof me. And what lies ahead.The sheeting’s stiff but holds warmth. My muscles relax, my heart rate slows. Isee the wooden box in the little boy’s hands, President Snow drawing out theyellowed envelope. Is it possible that this was really the Quarter Quell writtendown seventy-five years ago? It seems unlikely. It’s just too perfect an answerfor the troubles that face the Capitol today. Getting rid of me and subduing thedistricts all in one neat little package.I hear President Snow’s voice in my head. “On the seventy-fifth anniversary, asa reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome thepower of the Capitol, the male and female tributes will be reaped from theirexisting pool of victors.”Yes, victors are our strongest. They’re the ones who survived the arena andslipped the noose of poverty that strangles the rest of us. They, or should Isay we, are the very embodiment of hope where there is no hope. And nowtwenty-three of us will be killed to show how even that hope was an illusion.I’m glad I won only last year. Otherwise I’d know all the other victors, notjust because I see them on television but because they’re guests at every Games.Even if they’re not mentoring like Haymitch always has to, most return to theCapitol each year for the event. I think a lot of them are friends. Whereas theonly friend I’ll have to worry about killing will be either Peeta or Haymitch.Peeta or Haymitch!I sit straight up, throwing off the sheeting. What just went through my mind?There’s no situation in which I would ever kill Peeta or Haymitch. But one ofthem will be in the arena with me, and that’s a fact. They may have even decidedbetween them who it will be. Whoever is picked first, the other will have theoption of volunteering to take his place. I already know what will happen. Peetawill ask Haymitch to let him go into the arena with me no matter what. For mysake. To protect me.I stumble around the cellar, looking for an exit. How did I even get into thisplace? I feel my way up the steps to the kitchen and see the glass window in thedoor has been shattered. Must be why my hand seems to be bleeding. I hurry backinto the night and head straight to Haymitch’s house. He’s sitting alone at thekitchen table, a half-emptied bottle of white liquor in one fist, his knife inthe other. Drunk as a skunk.“Ah, there she is. All tuckered out. Finally did the math, did you, sweetheart?Worked out you won’t be going in alone? And now you’re here to ask me . . .what?” he says.I don’t answer. The window’s wide open and the wind cuts through me just as if Iwere outside.“I’ll admit, it was easier for the boy. He was here before I could snap the sealon a bottle. Begging me for another chance to go in. But what can you say?” Hemimics my voice. “ ‘Take his place, Haymitch, because all things being equal,I’d rather Peeta had a crack at the rest of his life than you?’ ”I bite my lip because once he’s said it, I’m afraid that’s what I do want. ForPeeta to live, even if it means Haymitch’s death. No, I don’t. He’s dreadful, ofcourse, but Haymitch is my family now. What did I come for? I think. What couldI possibly want here?“I came for a drink,” I say.Haymitch bursts out laughing and slams the bottle on the table before me. I runmy sleeve across the top and take a couple gulps before I come up choking. Ittakes a few minutes to compose myself, and even then my eyes and nose are stillstreaming. But inside me, the liquor feels like fire and I like it.“Maybe it should be you,” I say matter-of-factly as I pull up a chair. “You hatelife, anyway.”“Very true,” says Haymitch. “And since last time I tried to keep you alive . . .seems like I’m obligated to save the boy this time.”“That’s another good point,” I say, wiping my nose and tipping up the bottleagain.“Peeta’s argument is that since I chose you, I now owe him. Anything he wants.And what he wants is the chance to go in again to protect you,” says Haymitch.I knew it. In this way, Peeta’s not hard to predict. While I was wallowingaround on the floor of that cellar, thinking only of myself, he was here,thinking only of me. Shame isn’t a strong enough word for what I feel.“You could live a hundred lifetimes and not deserve him, you know,” Haymitchsays.“Yeah, yeah,” I say brusquely. “No question, he’s the superior one in this trio.So, what are you going to do?”“I don’t know.” Haymitch sighs. “Go back in with you maybe, if I can. If myname’s drawn at the reaping, it won’t matter. He’ll just volunteer to take myplace.”We sit for a while in silence. “It’d be bad for you in the arena, wouldn’t it?Knowing all the others?” I ask.“Oh, I think we can count on it being unbearable wherever I am.” He nods at thebottle. “Can I have that back now?”“No,” I say, wrapping my arms around it. Haymitch pulls another bottle out fromunder the table and gives the top a twist. But I realize I am not just here fora drink. There’s something else I want from Haymitch. “Okay, I figured out whatI’m asking,” I say. “If it is Peeta and me in the Games, this time we try tokeep him alive.”Something flickers across his bloodshot eyes. Pain.“Like you said, it’s going to be bad no matter how you slice it. And whateverPeeta wants, it’s his turn to be saved. We both owe him that.” My voice takes ona pleading tone. “Besides, the Capitol hates me so much, I’m as good as deadnow. He still might have a chance. Please, Haymitch. Say you’ll help me.”He frowns at his bottle, weighing my words. “All right,” he says finally.“Thanks,” I say. I should go see Peeta now, but I don’t want to. My head’sspinning from the drink, and I’m so wiped out, who knows what he could get me toagree to? No, now I have to go home to face my mother and Prim.As I stagger up the steps to my house, the front door opens and Gale pulls meinto his arms. “I was wrong. We should have gone when you said,” he whispers.“No,” I say. I’m having trouble focusing, and liquor keeps sloshing out of mybottle and down the back of Gale’s jacket, but he doesn’t seem to care.“It’s not too late,” he says.Over his shoulder, I see my mother and Prim clutching each other in the doorway.We run. They die. And now I’ve got Peeta to protect. End of discussion. “Yeah,it is.” My knees give way and he’s holding me up. As the alcohol overcomes mymind, I hear the glass bottle shatter on the floor. This seems appropriate sinceI have obviously lost my grip on everything.When I wake up, I barely get to the toilet before the white liquor makes itsreappearance. It burns just as much coming up as it did going down, and tastestwice as bad. I’m trembling and sweaty when I finish vomiting, but at least mostof the stuff is out of my system. Enough made it into my bloodstream, though, toresult in a pounding headache, parched mouth, and boiling stomach.I turn on the shower and stand under the warm rain for a minute before I realizeI’m still in my underclothes. My mother must have just stripped off my filthyouter ones and tucked me in bed. I throw the wet undergarments into the sink andpour shampoo on my head. My hands sting, and that’s when I notice the stitches,small and even, across one palm and up the side of the other hand. Vaguely Iremember breaking that glass window last night. I scrub myself from head to toe,only stopping to throw up again right in the shower. It’s mostly just bile andgoes down the drain with the sweet-smelling bubbles.Finally clean, I pull on my robe and head back to bed, ignoring my drippinghair. I climb under the blankets, sure this is what it must feel like to bepoisoned. The footsteps on the stairs renew my panic from last night. I’m notready to see my mother and Prim. I have to pull myself together to be calm andreassuring, the way I was when we said our good-byes the day of the lastreaping. I have to be strong. I struggle into an upright position, push my wethair off my throbbing temples, and brace myself for this meeting. They appear inthe doorway, holding tea and toast, their faces filled with concern. I open mymouth, planning to start off with some kind of joke, and burst into tears.So much for being strong.My mother sits on the side of the bed and Prim crawls right up next to me andthey hold me, making quiet soothing sounds, until I am mostly cried out. ThenPrim gets a towel and dries my hair, combing out the knots, while my mothercoaxes tea and toast into me. They dress me in warm pajamas and layer moreblankets on me and I drift off again.I can tell by the light it’s late afternoon when I come round again. There’s aglass of water on my bedside table and I gulp it down thirstily. My stomach andhead still feel rocky, but much better than they did earlier. I rise, dress, andbraid back my hair. Before I go down, I pause at the top of the stairs, feelingslightly embarrassed about the way I’ve handled the news of the Quarter Quell.My erratic flight, drinking with Haymitch, weeping. Given the circumstances, Iguess I deserve one day of indulgence. I’m glad the cameras weren’t here for it,though.Downstairs, my mother and Prim embrace me again, but they’re not overlyemotional. I know they’re holding things in to make it easier on me. Looking atPrim’s face, it’s hard to imagine she’s the same frail little girl I left behindon reaping day nine months ago. The combination of that ordeal and all that hasfollowed — the cruelty in the district, the parade of sick and wounded that sheoften treats by herself now if my mother’s hands are too full — these thingshave aged her years. She’s grown quite a bit, too; we’re practically the sameheight now, but that isn’t what makes her seem so much older.My mother ladles out a mug of broth for me, and I ask for a second mug to taketo Haymitch. Then I walk across the lawn to his house. He’s only just waking upand accepts the mug without comment. We sit there, almost peacefully, sippingour broth and watching the sun set through his living room window. I hearsomeone walking around upstairs and I assume it’s Hazelle, but a few minuteslater Peeta comes down and tosses a cardboard box of empty liquor bottles on thetable with finality.“There, it’s done,” he says.It’s taking all of Haymitch’s resources to focus his eyes on the bottles, so Ispeak up. “What’s done?”“I’ve poured all the liquor down the drain,” says Peeta.This seems to jolt Haymitch out of his stupor, and he paws through the box indisbelief. “You what?”“I tossed the lot,” says Peeta.“He’ll just buy more,” I say.“No, he won’t,” says Peeta. “I tracked down Ripper this morning and told her I’dturn her in the second she sold to either of you. I paid her off, too, just forgood measure, but I don’t think she’s eager to be back in the Peacekeepers’custody.”Haymitch takes a swipe with his knife but Peeta deflects it so easily it’spathetic. Anger rises up in me. “What business is it of yours what he does?”“It’s completely my business. However it falls out, two of us are going to be inthe arena again with the other as mentor. We can’t afford any drunkards on thisteam. Especially not you, Katniss,” says Peeta to me.“What?” I sputter indignantly. It would be more convincing if I weren’t still sohungover. “Last night’s the only time I’ve ever even been drunk.”“Yeah, and look at the shape you’re in,” says Peeta.I don’t know what I expected from my first meeting with Peeta after theannouncement. A few hugs and kisses. A little comfort maybe. Not this. I turn toHaymitch. “Don’t worry, I’ll get you more liquor.”“Then I’ll turn you both in. Let you sober up in the stocks,” says Peeta.“What’s the point to this?” asks Haymitch.“The point is that two of us are coming home from the Capitol. One mentor andone victor,” says Peeta. “Effie’s sending me recordings of all the livingvictors. We’re going to watch their Games and learn everything we can about howthey fight. We’re going to put on weight and get strong. We’re going to startacting like Careers. And one of us is going to be victor again whether you twolike it or not!” He sweeps out of the room, slamming the front door.Haymitch and I wince at the bang.“I don’t like self-righteous people,” I say.“What’s to like?” says Haymitch, who begins sucking the dregs out of the emptybottles.“You and me. That’s who he plans on coming home,” I say.“Well, then the joke’s on him,” says Haymitch.But after a few days, we agree to act like Careers, because this is the best wayto get Peeta ready as well. Every night we watch the old recaps of the Gamesthat the remaining victors won. I realize we never met any of them on theVictory Tour, which seems odd in retrospect. When I bring it up, Haymitch saysthe last thing President Snow would’ve wanted was to show Peeta and me —especially me — bonding with other victors in potentially rebellious districts.Victors have a special status, and if they appeared to be supporting my defianceof the Capitol, it would’ve been dangerous politically. Adjusting for age, Irealize some of our opponents may be elderly, which is both sad and reassuring.Peeta takes copious notes, Haymitch volunteers information about the victors’personalities, and slowly we begin to know our competition.Every morning we do exercises to strengthen our bodies. We run and lift thingsand stretch our muscles. Every afternoon we work on combat skills, throwingknives, fighting hand to hand; I even teach them to climb trees. Officially,tributes aren’t supposed to train, but no one tries to stop us. Even in regularyears, the tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4 show up able to wield spears andswords. This is nothing by comparison.After all the years of abuse, Haymitch’s body resists improvement. He’s stillremarkably strong, but the shortest run winds him. And you’d think a guy whosleeps every night with a knife might actually be able to hit the side of ahouse with one, but his hands shake so badly it takes weeks for him to achieveeven that.Peeta and I excel under the new regimen, though. It gives me something to do. Itgives us all something to do besides accept defeat. My mother puts us on aspecial diet to gain weight. Prim treats our sore muscles. Madge sneaks us herfather’s Capitol newspapers. Predictions on who will be victor of the victorsshow us among the favorites. Even Gale steps into the picture on Sundays,although he’s got no love for Peeta or Haymitch, and teaches us all he knowsabout snares. It’s weird for me, being in conversations with both Peeta andGale, but they seem to have set aside whatever issues they have about me.One night, as I’m walking Gale back into town, he even admits, “It’d be betterif he were easier to hate.”“Tell me about it,” I say. “If I could’ve just hated him in the arena, we allwouldn’t be in this mess now. He’d be dead, and I’d be a happy little victor allby myself.”“And where would we be, Katniss?” asks Gale.I pause, not knowing what to say. Where would I be with my pretend cousin whowouldn’t be my cousin if it weren’t for Peeta? Would he have still kissed me andwould I have kissed him back had I been free to do so? Would I have let myselfopen up to him, lulled by the security of money and food and the illusion ofsafety being a victor could bring under different circumstances? But there wouldstill always be the reaping looming over us, over our children. No matter what Iwanted . . .“Hunting. Like every Sunday,” I say. I know he didn’t mean the questionliterally, but this is as much as I can honestly give. Gale knows I chose himover Peeta when I didn’t make a run for it. To me, there’s no point in talkingabout things that might have been. Even if I had killed Peeta in the arena, Istill wouldn’t have wanted to marry anyone. I only got engaged to save people’slives, and that completely backfired.I’m afraid, anyway, that any kind of emotional scene with Gale might cause himto do something drastic. Like start that uprising in the mines. And as Haymitchsays, District 12 isn’t ready for that. If anything, they’re less ready thanbefore the Quarter Quell announcement, because the following morning anotherhundred Peacekeepers arrived on the train.Since I don’t plan on making it back alive a second time, the sooner Gale letsme go, the better. I do plan on saying one or two things to him after thereaping, when we’re allowed an hour for good-byes. To let Gale know howessential he’s been to me all these years. How much better my life has been forknowing him. For loving him, even if it’s only in the limited way that I canmanage.But I never get the chance.The day of the reaping’s hot and sultry. The population of District 12 waits,sweating and silent, in the square with machine guns trained on them. I standalone in a small roped-off area with Peeta and Haymitch in a similar pen to theright of me. The reaping takes only a minute. Effie, shining in a wig ofmetallic gold, lacks her usual verve. She has to claw around the girls’ reapingball for quite a while to snag the one piece of paper that everyone alreadyknows has my name on it. Then she catches Haymitch’s name. He barely has time toshoot me an unhappy look before Peeta has volunteered to take his place.We are immediately marched into the Justice Building to find Head PeacekeeperThread waiting for us. “New procedure,” he says with a smile. We’re ushered outthe back door, into a car, and taken to the train station. There are no camerason the platform, no crowd to send us on our way. Haymitch and Effie appear,escorted by guards. Peacekeepers hurry us all onto the train and slam the door.The wheels begin to turn.And I’m left staring out the window, watching District 12 disappear, with all mygood-byes still hanging on my lips."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00009.jpg]I remain at the window long after the woods have swallowed up the last glimpseof my home. This time I don’t have even the slightest hope of return. Before myfirst Games, I promised Prim I would do everything I could to win, and now I’vesworn to myself to do all I can to keep Peeta alive. I will never reverse thisjourney again.I’d actually figured out what I wanted my last words to my loved ones to be. Howbest to close and lock the doors and leave them sad but safely behind. And nowthe Capitol has stolen that as well.“We’ll write letters, Katniss,” says Peeta from behind me. “It will be better,anyway. Give them a piece of us to hold on to. Haymitch will deliver them for usif . . . they need to be delivered.”I nod and go straight to my room. I sit on the bed, knowing I will never writethose letters. They will be like the speech I tried to write to honor Rue andThresh in District 11. Things seemed clear in my head and even when I talkedbefore the crowd, but the words never came out of the pen right. Besides, theywere meant to go with embraces and kisses and a stroke of Prim’s hair, a caressof Gale’s face, a squeeze of Madge’s hand. They cannot be delivered with awooden box containing my cold, stiff body.Too heartsick to cry, all I want is to curl up on the bed and sleep until wearrive in the Capitol tomorrow morning. But I have a mission. No, it’s more thana mission. It’s my dying wish. Keep Peeta alive. And as unlikely as it seemsthat I can achieve it in the face of the Capitol’s anger, it’s important that Ibe at the top of my game. This won’t happen if I’m mourning for everyone I loveback home. Let them go, I tell myself. Say good-bye and forget them. I do mybest, thinking of them one by one, releasing them like birds from the protectivecages inside me, locking the doors against their return.By the time Effie knocks on my door to call me to dinner, I’m empty. But thelightness isn’t entirely unwelcome.The meal’s subdued. So subdued, in fact, that there are long periods of silencerelieved only by the removal of old dishes and presentation of new ones. A coldsoup of pureed vegetables. Fish cakes with creamy lime paste. Those little birdsfilled with orange sauce, with wild rice and watercress. Chocolate custarddotted with cherries.Peeta and Effie make occasional attempts at conversation that quickly die out.“I love your new hair, Effie,” Peeta says.“Thank you. I had it especially done to match Katniss’s pin. I was thinking wemight get you a golden ankle band and maybe find Haymitch a gold bracelet orsomething so we could all look like a team,” says Effie.Evidently, Effie doesn’t know that my mockingjay pin is now a symbol used by therebels. At least in District 8. In the Capitol, the mockingjay is still a funreminder of an especially exciting Hunger Games. What else could it be? Realrebels don’t put a secret symbol on something as durable as jewelry. They put iton a wafer of bread that can be eaten in a second if necessary.“I think that’s a great idea,” says Peeta. “How about it, Haymitch?”“Yeah, whatever,” says Haymitch. He’s not drinking but I can tell he’d like tobe. Effie had them take her own wine away when she saw the effort he was making,but he’s in a miserable state. If he were the tribute, he would have owed Peetanothing and could be as drunk as he liked. Now it’s going to take all he’s gotto keep Peeta alive in an arena full of his old friends, and he’ll probablyfail.“Maybe we could get you a wig, too,” I say in an attempt at lightness. He justshoots me a look that says to leave him alone, and we all eat our custard insilence.“Shall we watch the recap of the reapings?” says Effie, dabbing at the cornersof her mouth with a white linen napkin.Peeta goes off to retrieve his notebook on the remaining living victors, and wegather in the compartment with the television to see who our competition will bein the arena. We are all in place as the anthem begins to play and the annualrecap of the reaping ceremonies in the twelve districts begins.In the history of the Games, there have been seventy-five victors. Fifty-nineare still alive. I recognize many of their faces, either from seeing them astributes or mentors at previous Games or from our recent viewing of the victors’tapes. Some are so old or wasted by illness, drugs, or drink that I can’t placethem. As one would expect, the pools of Career tributes from Districts 1, 2, and4 are the largest. But every district has managed to scrape up at least onefemale and one male victor.The reapings go by quickly. Peeta studiously puts stars by the names of thechosen tributes in his notebook. Haymitch watches, his face devoid of emotion,as friends of his step up to take the stage. Effie makes hushed, distressedcomments like “Oh, not Cecelia” or “Well, Chaff never could stay out of afight,” and sighs frequently.For my part, I try to make some mental record of the other tributes, but likelast year, only a few really stick in my head. There’s the classically beautifulbrother and sister from District 1 who were victors in consecutive years when Iwas little. Brutus, a volunteer from District 2, who must be at least forty andapparently can’t wait to get back in the arena. Finnick, the handsomebronze-haired guy from District 4 who was crowned ten years ago at the age offourteen. A hysterical young woman with flowing brown hair is also called from4, but she’s quickly replaced by a volunteer, an eighty-year-old woman who needsa cane to walk to the stage. Then there’s Johanna Mason, the only living femalevictor from 7, who won a few years back by pretending she was a weakling. Thewoman from 8 who Effie calls Cecelia, who looks about thirty, has to detachherself from the three kids who run up to cling to her. Chaff, a man from 11 whoI know to be one of Haymitch’s particular friends, is also in.I’m called. Then Haymitch. And Peeta volunteers. One of the announcers actuallygets teary because it seems the odds will never be in our favor, we star-crossedlovers of District 12. Then she pulls herself together to say she bets that“these will be the best Games ever!”Haymitch leaves the compartment without a word, and Effie, after making a fewunconnected comments about this tribute or that, bids us good night. I just sitthere watching Peeta rip out the pages of the victors who were not picked.“Why don’t you get some sleep?” he says.Because I can’t handle the nightmares. Not without you, I think. They are sureto be dreadful tonight. But I can hardly ask Peeta to come sleep with me. We’vebarely touched since that night Gale was whipped. “What are you going to do?” Iask.“Just review my notes awhile. Get a clear picture of what we’re up against. ButI’ll go over it with you in the morning. Go to bed, Katniss,” he says.So I go to bed and, sure enough, within a few hours I awake from a nightmarewhere that old woman from District 4 transforms into a large rodent and gnaws onmy face. I know I was screaming, but no one comes. Not Peeta, not even one ofthe Capitol attendants. I pull on a robe to try to calm the gooseflesh crawlingover my body. Staying in my compartment is impossible, so I decide to go findsomeone to make me tea or hot chocolate or anything. Maybe Haymitch is still up.Surely he isn’t asleep.I order warm milk, the most calming thing I can think of, from an attendant.Hearing voices from the television room, I go in and find Peeta. Beside him onthe couch is the box Effie sent of tapes of the old Hunger Games. I recognizethe episode in which Brutus became victor.Peeta rises and flips off the tape when he sees me. “Couldn’t sleep?”“Not for long,” I say. I pull the robe more securely around me as I remember theold woman transforming into the rodent.“Want to talk about it?” he asks. Sometimes that can help, but I just shake myhead, feeling weak that people I haven’t even fought yet already haunt me.When Peeta holds out his arms, I walk straight into them. It’s the first timesince they announced the Quarter Quell that he’s offered me any sort ofaffection. He’s been more like a very demanding trainer, always pushing, alwaysinsisting Haymitch and I run faster, eat more, know our enemy better. Lover?Forget about that. He abandoned any pretense of even being my friend. I wrap myarms tightly around his neck before he can order me to do push-ups or something.Instead he pulls me in close and buries his face in my hair. Warmth radiatesfrom the spot where his lips just touch my neck, slowly spreading through therest of me. It feels so good, so impossibly good, that I know I will not be thefirst to let go.And why should I? I have said good-bye to Gale. I’ll never see him again, that’sfor certain. Nothing I do now can hurt him. He won’t see it or he’ll think I amacting for the cameras. That, at least, is one weight off my shoulders.The arrival of the Capitol attendant with the warm milk is what breaks us apart.He sets a tray with a steaming ceramic jug and two mugs on a table. “I broughtan extra cup,” he says.“Thanks,” I say.“And I added a touch of honey to the milk. For sweetness. And just a pinch ofspice,” he adds. He looks at us like he wants to say more, then gives his head aslight shake and backs out of the room.“What’s with him?” I say.“I think he feels bad for us,” says Peeta.“Right,” I say, pouring the milk.“I mean it. I don’t think the people in the Capitol are going to be all thathappy about our going back in,” says Peeta. “Or the other victors. They getattached to their champions.”“I’m guessing they’ll get over it once the blood starts flowing,” I say flatly.Really, if there’s one thing I don’t have time for, it’s worrying about how theQuarter Quell will affect the mood in the Capitol. “So, you’re watching all thetapes again?”“Not really. Just sort of skipping around to see people’s different fightingtechniques,” says Peeta.“Who’s next?” I ask.“You pick,” says Peeta, holding out the box.The tapes are marked with the year of the Games and the name of the victor. Idig around and suddenly find one in my hand that we have not watched. The yearof the Games is fifty. That would make it the second Quarter Quell. And the nameof the victor is Haymitch Abernathy.“We never watched this one,” I say.Peeta shakes his head. “No. I knew Haymitch didn’t want to. The same way wedidn’t want to relive our own Games. And since we’re all on the same team, Ididn’t think it mattered much.”“Is the person who won in twenty-five in here?” I ask.“I don’t think so. Whoever it was must be dead by now, and Effie only sent mevictors we might have to face.” Peeta weighs Haymitch’s tape in his hand. “Why?You think we ought to watch it?”“It’s the only Quell we have. We might pick up something valuable about how theywork,” I say. But I feel weird. It seems like some major invasion of Haymitch’sprivacy. I don’t know why it should, since the whole thing was public. But itdoes. I have to admit I’m also extremely curious. “We don’t have to tellHaymitch we saw it.”“Okay,” Peeta agrees. He puts in the tape and I curl up next to him on the couchwith my milk, which is really delicious with the honey and spices, and losemyself in the Fiftieth Hunger Games. After the anthem, they show President Snowdrawing the envelope for the second Quarter Quell. He looks younger but just asrepellent. He reads from the square of paper in the same onerous voice he usedfor ours, informing Panem that in honor of the Quarter Quell, there will betwice the number of tributes. The editors smash cut right into the reapings,where name after name after name is called.By the time we get to District 12, I’m completely overwhelmed by the sheernumber of kids going to certain death. There’s a woman, not Effie, calling thenames in 12, but she still begins with “Ladies first!” She calls out the name ofa girl who’s from the Seam, you can tell by the look of her, and then I hear thename “Maysilee Donner.”“Oh!” I say. “She was my mother’s friend.” The camera finds her in the crowd,clinging to two other girls. All blond. All definitely merchants’ kids.“I think that’s your mother hugging her,” says Peeta quietly. And he’s right. AsMaysilee Donner bravely disengages herself and heads for the stage, I catch aglimpse of my mother at my age, and no one has exaggerated her beauty. Holdingher hand and weeping is another girl who looks just like Maysilee. But a lotlike someone else I know, too.“Madge,” I say.“That’s her mother. She and Maysilee were twins or something,” Peeta says. “Mydad mentioned it once.”I think of Madge’s mother. Mayor Undersee’s wife. Who spends half her life inbed immobilized with terrible pain, shutting out the world. I think of how Inever realized that she and my mother shared this connection. Of Madge showingup in that snowstorm to bring the painkiller for Gale. Of my mockingjay pin andhow it means something completely different now that I know that its formerowner was Madge’s aunt, Maysilee Donner, a tribute who was murdered in thearena.Haymitch’s name is called last of all. It’s more of a shock to see him than mymother. Young. Strong. Hard to admit, but he was something of a looker. His hairdark and curly, those gray Seam eyes bright and, even then, dangerous.“Oh. Peeta, you don’t think he killed Maysilee, do you?” I burst out. I don’tknow why, but I can’t stand the thought.“With forty-eight players? I’d say the odds are against it,” says Peeta.The chariot rides — in which the District 12 kids are dressed in awful coalminers’ outfits — and the interviews flash by. There’s little time to focus onanyone. But since Haymitch is going to be the victor, we get to see one fullexchange between him and Caesar Flickerman, who looks exactly as he always doesin his twinkling midnight blue suit. Only his dark green hair, eyelids, and lipsare different.“So, Haymitch, what do you think of the Games having one hundred percent morecompetitors than usual?” asks Caesar.Haymitch shrugs. “I don’t see that it makes much difference. They’ll still beone hundred percent as stupid as usual, so I figure my odds will be roughly thesame.”The audience bursts out laughing and Haymitch gives them a half smile. Snarky.Arrogant. Indifferent.“He didn’t have to reach far for that, did he?” I say.Now it’s the morning the Games begin. We watch from the point of view of one ofthe tributes as she rises up through the tube from the Launch Room and into thearena. I can’t help but give a slight gasp. Disbelief is reflected on the facesof the players. Even Haymitch’s eyebrows lift in pleasure, although they almostimmediately knit themselves back into a scowl.It’s the most breathtaking place imaginable. The golden Cornucopia sits in themiddle of a green meadow with patches of gorgeous flowers. The sky is azure bluewith puffy white clouds. Bright songbirds flutter overhead. By the way some ofthe tributes are sniffing, it must smell fantastic. An aerial shot shows thatthe meadow stretches for miles. Far in the distance, in one direction, thereseems to be a woods, in the other, a snowcapped mountain.The beauty disorients many of the players, because when the gong sounds, most ofthem seem like they’re trying to wake from a dream. Not Haymitch, though. He’sat the Cornucopia, armed with weapons and a backpack of choice supplies. Heheads for the woods before most of the others have stepped off their plates.Eighteen tributes are killed in the bloodbath that first day. Others begin todie off and it becomes clear that almost everything in this pretty place — theluscious fruit dangling from the bushes, the water in the crystalline streams,even the scent of the flowers when inhaled too directly — is deadly poisonous.Only the rainwater and the food provided at the Cornucopia are safe to consume.There’s also a large, well-stocked Career pack of ten tributes scouring themountain area for victims.Haymitch has his own troubles over in the woods, where the fluffy goldensquirrels turn out to be carnivorous and attack in packs, and the butterflystings bring agony if not death. But he persists in moving forward, alwayskeeping the distant mountain at his back.Maysilee Donner turns out to be pretty resourceful herself, for a girl wholeaves the Cornucopia with only a small backpack. Inside she finds a bowl, somedried beef, and a blowgun with two dozen darts. Making use of the readilyavailable poisons, she soon turns the blowgun into a deadly weapon by dippingthe darts in lethal substances and directing them into her opponents’ flesh.Four days in, the picturesque mountain erupts in a volcano that wipes outanother dozen players, including all but five of the Career pack. With themountain spewing liquid fire, and the meadow offering no means of concealment,the remaining thirteen tributes — including Haymitch and Maysilee — have nochoice but to confine themselves to the woods.Haymitch seems bent on continuing in the same direction, away from the nowvolcanic mountain, but a maze of tightly woven hedges forces him to circle backinto the center of the woods, where he encounters three of the Careers and pullshis knife. They may be much bigger and stronger, but Haymitch has remarkablespeed and has killed two when the third disarms him. That Career is about toslit his throat when a dart drops him to the ground.Maysilee Donner steps out of the woods. “We’d live longer with two of us.”“Guess you just proved that,” says Haymitch, rubbing his neck. “Allies?”Maysilee nods. And there they are, instantly drawn into one of those pacts you’dbe hard-pressed to break if you ever expect to go home and face your district.Just like Peeta and me, they do better together. Get more rest, work out asystem to salvage more rainwater, fight as a team, and share the food from thedead tributes’ packs. But Haymitch is still determined to keep moving on.“Why?” Maysilee keeps asking, and he ignores her until she refuses to move anyfarther without an answer.“Because it has to end somewhere, right?” says Haymitch. “The arena can’t go onforever.”“What do you expect to find?” Maysilee asks.“I don’t know. But maybe there’s something we can use,” he says.When they finally do make it through that impossible hedge, using a blowtorchfrom one of the dead Careers’ packs, they find themselves on flat, dry earththat leads to a cliff. Far below, you can see jagged rocks.“That’s all there is, Haymitch. Let’s go back,” says Maysilee.“No, I’m staying here,” he says.“All right. There’s only five of us left. May as well say good-bye now, anyway,”she says. “I don’t want it to come down to you and me.”“Okay,” he agrees. That’s all. He doesn’t offer to shake her hand or even lookat her. And she walks away.Haymitch skirts along the edge of the cliff as if trying to figure somethingout. His foot dislodges a pebble and it falls into the abyss, apparently goneforever. But a minute later, as he sits to rest, the pebble shoots back upbeside him. Haymitch stares at it, puzzled, and then his face takes on a strangeintensity. He lobs a rock the size of his fist over the cliff and waits. When itflies back out and right into his hand, he starts laughing.That’s when we hear Maysilee begin to scream. The alliance is over and she brokeit off, so no one could blame him for ignoring her. But Haymitch runs for her,anyway. He arrives only in time to watch the last of a flock of candy pinkbirds, equipped with long, thin beaks, skewer her through the neck. He holds herhand while she dies, and all I can think of is Rue and how I was too late tosave her, too.Later that day, another tribute is killed in combat and a third gets eaten by apack of those fluffy squirrels, leaving Haymitch and a girl from District 1 tovie for the crown. She’s bigger than he is and just as fast, and when theinevitable fight comes, it’s bloody and awful and both have received what couldwell be fatal wounds, when Haymitch is finally disarmed. He staggers through thebeautiful woods, holding his intestines in, while she stumbles after him,carrying the ax that should deliver his deathblow. Haymitch makes a beeline forhis cliff and has just reached the edge when she throws the ax. He collapses onthe ground and it flies into the abyss. Now weaponless as well, the girl juststands there, trying to staunch the flow of blood pouring from her empty eyesocket. She’s thinking perhaps that she can outlast Haymitch, who’s starting toconvulse on the ground. But what she doesn’t know, and what he does, is that theax will return. And when it flies back over the ledge, it buries itself in herhead. The cannon sounds, her body is removed, and the trumpets blow to announceHaymitch’s victory.Peeta clicks off the tape and we sit there in silence for a while.Finally Peeta says, “That force field at the bottom of the cliff, it was likethe one on the roof of the Training Center. The one that throws you back if youtry to jump off and commit suicide. Haymitch found a way to turn it into aweapon.”“Not just against the other tributes, but the Capitol, too,” I say. “You knowthey didn’t expect that to happen. It wasn’t meant to be part of the arena. Theynever planned on anyone using it as a weapon. It made them look stupid that hefigured it out. I bet they had a good time trying to spin that one. Bet that’swhy I don’t remember seeing it on television. It’s almost as bad as us and theberries!”I can’t help laughing, really laughing, for the first time in months. Peeta justshakes his head like I’ve lost my mind — and maybe I have, a little.“Almost, but not quite,” says Haymitch from behind us. I whip around, afraidhe’s going to be angry over us watching his tape, but he just smirks and takes aswig from a bottle of wine. So much for sobriety. I guess I should be upset he’sdrinking again, but I’m preoccupied with another feeling.I’ve spent all these weeks getting to know who my competitors are, without eventhinking about who my teammates are. Now a new kind of confidence is lighting upinside of me, because I think I finally know who Haymitch is. And I’m beginningto know who I am. And surely, two people who have caused the Capitol so muchtrouble can think of a way to get Peeta home alive."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00005.jpg]Having been through prep with Flavius, Venia, and Octavia numerous times, itshould just be an old routine to survive. But I haven’t anticipated theemotional ordeal that awaits me. At some point during the prep, each of thembursts into tears at least twice, and Octavia pretty much keeps up a runningwhimper throughout the morning. It turns out they really have become attached tome, and the idea of my returning to the arena has undone them. Combine that withthe fact that by losing me they’ll be losing their ticket to all kinds of bigsocial events, particularly my wedding, and the whole thing becomes unbearable.The idea of being strong for someone else having never entered their heads, Ifind myself in the position of having to console them. Since I’m the persongoing in to be slaughtered, this is somewhat annoying.It’s interesting, though, when I think of what Peeta said about the attendant onthe train being unhappy about the victors having to fight again. About people inthe Capitol not liking it. I still think all of that will be forgotten once thegong sounds, but it’s something of a revelation that those in the Capitol feelanything at all about us. They certainly don’t have a problem watching childrenmurdered every year. But maybe they know too much about the victors, especiallythe ones who’ve been celebrities for ages, to forget we’re human beings. It’smore like watching your own friends die. More like the Games are for those of usin the districts.By the time Cinna shows up, I am irritable and exhausted from comforting theprep team, especially because their constant tears are reminding me of the onesundoubtedly being shed at home. Standing there in my thin robe with my stingingskin and heart, I know I can’t bear even one more look of regret. So the momenthe walks in the door I snap, “I swear if you cry, I’ll kill you here and now.”Cinna just smiles. “Had a damp morning?”“You could wring me out,” I reply.Cinna puts his arm around my shoulder and leads me into lunch. “Don’t worry. Ialways channel my emotions into my work. That way I don’t hurt anyone butmyself.”“I can’t go through that again,” I warn him.“I know. I’ll talk to them,” says Cinna.Lunch makes me feel a bit better. Pheasant with a selection of jewel-coloredjellies, and tiny versions of real vegetables swimming in butter, and potatoesmashed with parsley. For dessert we dip chunks of fruit in a pot of meltedchocolate, and Cinna has to order a second pot because I start just eating thestuff with a spoon.“So, what are we wearing for the opening ceremonies?” I finally ask as I scrapethe second pot clean. “Headlamps or fire?” I know the chariot ride will requirePeeta and me to be dressed in something coal related.“Something along that line,” he says.When it’s time to get in costume for the opening ceremonies, my prep team showsup but Cinna sends them away, saying they’ve done such a spectacular job in themorning, there’s nothing left to do. They go off to recover, thankfully leavingme in Cinna’s hands. He puts up my hair first, in the braided style my motherintroduced him to, then proceeds with my makeup. Last year he used little sothat the audience would recognize me when I landed in the arena. But now my faceis almost obscured by the dramatic highlights and dark shadows. High archingeyebrows, sharp cheekbones, smoldering eyes, deep purple lips. The costume looksdeceptively simple at first, just a fitted black jumpsuit that covers me fromthe neck down. He places a half crown like the one I received as victor on myhead, but it’s made of a heavy black metal, not gold. Then he adjusts the lightin the room to mimic twilight and presses a button just inside the fabric on mywrist. I look down, fascinated, as my ensemble slowly comes to life, first witha soft golden light but gradually transforming to the orange-red of burningcoal. I look as if I have been coated in glowing embers — no, that I am aglowing ember straight from our fireplace. The colors rise and fall, shift andblend, in exactly the way the coals do.“How did you do this?” I say in wonder.“Portia and I spent a lot of hours watching fires,” says Cinna. “Now look atyourself.”He turns me toward a mirror so that I can take in the entire effect. I do notsee a girl, or even a woman, but some unearthly being who looks like she mightmake her home in the volcano that destroyed so many in Haymitch’s Quell. Theblack crown, which now appears red-hot, casts strange shadows on my dramaticallymade-up face. Katniss, the girl on fire, has left behind her flickering flamesand bejeweled gowns and soft candlelight frocks. She is as deadly as fireitself.“I think . . . this is just what I needed to face the others,” I say.“Yes, I think your days of pink lipstick and ribbons are behind you,” saysCinna. He touches the button on my wrist again, extinguishing my light. “Let’snot run down your power pack. When you’re on the chariot this time, no waving,no smiling. I just want you to look straight ahead, as if the entire audience isbeneath your notice.”“Finally something I’ll be good at,” I say.Cinna has a few more things to attend to, so I decide to head down to the groundfloor of the Remake Center, which houses the huge gathering place for thetributes and their chariots before the opening ceremonies. I’m hoping to findPeeta and Haymitch, but they haven’t arrived yet. Unlike last year, when all thetributes were practically glued to their chariots, the scene is very social. Thevictors, both this year’s tributes and their mentors, are standing around insmall groups, talking. Of course, they all know one another and I don’t knowanyone, and I’m not really the sort of person to go around introducing myself.So I just stroke the neck of one of my horses and try not to be noticed.It doesn’t work.The crunching hits my ear before I even know he’s beside me, and when I turn myhead, Finnick Odair’s famous sea green eyes are only inches from mine. He pops asugar cube in his mouth and leans against my horse.“Hello, Katniss,” he says, as if we’ve known each other for years, when in factwe’ve never met.“Hello, Finnick,” I say, just as casually, although I’m feeling uncomfortable athis closeness, especially since he’s got so much bare skin exposed.“Want a sugar cube?” he says, offering his hand, which is piled high. “They’resupposed to be for the horses, but who cares? They’ve got years to eat sugar,whereas you and I . . . well, if we see something sweet, we better grab itquick.”Finnick Odair is something of a living legend in Panem. Since he won theSixty-fifth Hunger Games when he was only fourteen, he’s still one of theyoungest victors. Being from District 4, he was a Career, so the odds werealready in his favor, but what no trainer could claim to have given him was hisextraordinary beauty. Tall, athletic, with golden skin and bronze-colored hairand those incredible eyes. While other tributes that year were hard-pressed toget a handful of grain or some matches for a gift, Finnick never wanted foranything, not food or medicine or weapons. It took about a week for hiscompetitors to realize that he was the one to kill, but it was too late. He wasalready a good fighter with the spears and knives he had found in theCornucopia. When he received a silver parachute with a trident — which may bethe most expensive gift I’ve ever seen given in the arena — it was all over.District 4’s industry is fishing. He’d been on boats his whole life. The tridentwas a natural, deadly extension of his arm. He wove a net out of some kind ofvine he found, used it to entangle his opponents so he could spear them with thetrident, and within a matter of days the crown was his.The citizens of the Capitol have been drooling over him ever since.Because of his youth, they couldn’t really touch him for the first year or two.But ever since he turned sixteen, he’s spent his time at the Games being doggedby those desperately in love with him. No one retains his favor for long. He cango through four or five in his annual visit. Old or young, lovely or plain, richor very rich, he’ll keep them company and take their extravagant gifts, but henever stays, and once he’s gone he never comes back.I can’t argue that Finnick isn’t one of the most stunning, sensuous people onthe planet. But I can honestly say he’s never been attractive to me. Maybe he’stoo pretty, or maybe he’s too easy to get, or maybe it’s really that he’d justbe too easy to lose.“No, thanks,” I say to the sugar. “I’d love to borrow your outfit sometime,though.”He’s draped in a golden net that’s strategically knotted at his groin so that hecan’t technically be called naked, but he’s about as close as you can get. I’msure his stylist thinks the more of Finnick the audience sees, the better.“You’re absolutely terrifying me in that getup. What happened to the prettylittle-girl dresses?” he asks. He wets his lips just ever so slightly with histongue. Probably this drives most people crazy. But for some reason all I canthink of is old Cray, salivating over some poor, starving young woman.“I outgrew them,” I say.Finnick takes the collar of my outfit and runs it between his fingers. “It’s toobad about this Quell thing. You could have made out like a bandit in theCapitol. Jewels, money, anything you wanted.”“I don’t like jewels, and I have more money than I need. What do you spend allyours on, anyway, Finnick?” I say.“Oh, I haven’t dealt in anything as common as money for years,” says Finnick.“Then how do they pay you for the pleasure of your company?” I ask.“With secrets,” he says softly. He tips his head in so his lips are almost incontact with mine. “What about you, girl on fire? Do you have any secrets worthmy time?”For some stupid reason, I blush, but I force myself to hold my ground. “No, I’man open book,” I whisper back. “Everybody seems to know my secrets before I knowthem myself.”He smiles. “Unfortunately, I think that’s true.” His eyes flicker off to theside. “Peeta is coming. Sorry you have to cancel your wedding. I know howdevastating that must be for you.” He tosses another sugar cube in his mouth andsaunters off.Peeta’s beside me, dressed in an outfit identical to mine. “What did FinnickOdair want?” he asks.I turn and put my lips close to Peeta’s and drop my eyelids in imitation ofFinnick. “He offered me sugar and wanted to know all my secrets,” I say in mybest seductive voice.Peeta laughs. “Ugh. Not really.”“Really,” I say. “I’ll tell you more when my skin stops crawling.”“Do you think we’d have ended up like this if only one of us had won?” he asks,glancing around at the other victors. “Just another part of the freak show?”“Sure. Especially you,” I say.“Oh. And why especially me?” he says with a smile.“Because you have a weakness for beautiful things and I don’t,” I say with anair of superiority. “They would lure you into their Capitol ways and you’d belost entirely.”“Having an eye for beauty isn’t the same thing as a weakness,” Peeta points out.“Except possibly when it comes to you.” The music is beginning and I see thewide doors opening for the first chariot, hear the roar of the crowd. “Shallwe?” He holds out a hand to help me into the chariot.I climb up and pull him up after me. “Hold still,” I say, and straighten hiscrown. “Have you seen your suit turned on? We’re going to be fabulous again.”“Absolutely. But Portia says we’re to be very above it all. No waving oranything,” he says. “Where are they, anyway?”“I don’t know.” I eye the procession of chariots. “Maybe we better go ahead andswitch ourselves on.” We do, and as we begin to glow, I can see people pointingat us and chattering, and I know that, once again, we’ll be the talk of theopening ceremonies. We’re almost at the door. I crane my head around, butneither Portia nor Cinna, who were with us right up to the final second lastyear, are anywhere in sight. “Are we supposed to hold hands this year?” I ask.“I guess they’ve left it up to us,” says Peeta.I look up into those blue eyes that no amount of dramatic makeup can make trulydeadly and remember how, just a year ago, I was prepared to kill him. Convincedhe was trying to kill me. Now everything is reversed. I’m determined to keep himalive, knowing the cost will be my own life, but the part of me that is not sobrave as I could wish is glad that it’s Peeta, not Haymitch, beside me. Ourhands find each other without further discussion. Of course we will go into thisas one.The voice of the crowd rises into one universal scream as we roll into thefading evening light, but neither one of us reacts. I simply fix my eyes on apoint far in the distance and pretend there is no audience, no hysteria. I can’thelp catching glimpses of us on the huge screens along the route, and we are notjust beautiful, we are dark and powerful. No, more. We star-crossed lovers fromDistrict 12, who suffered so much and enjoyed so little the rewards of ourvictory, do not seek the fans’ favor, grace them with our smiles, or catch theirkisses. We are unforgiving.And I love it. Getting to be myself at last.As we curve around into the loop of the City Circle, I can see that a couple ofthe other stylists have tried to steal Cinna and Portia’s idea of illuminatingtheir tributes. The electric-light-studded outfits from District 3, where theymake electronics, at least make sense. But what are the livestock keepers fromDistrict 10, who are dressed as cows, doing with flaming belts? Broilingthemselves? Pathetic.Peeta and I, on the other hand, are so mesmerizing with our ever-changing coalcostumes that most of the other tributes are staring at us. We seem particularlyriveting to the pair from District 6, who are known morphling addicts. Both bonethin, with sagging yellowish skin. They can’t tear their overlarge eyes away,even when President Snow begins to speak from his balcony, welcoming us all tothe Quell. The anthem plays, and as we make our final trip around the circle, amI wrong? Or do I see the president fixated on me as well?Peeta and I wait until the doors of the Training Center have closed behind us torelax. Cinna and Portia are there, pleased with our performance, and Haymitchhas made an appearance this year as well, only he’s not at our chariot, he’sover with the tributes of District 11. I see him nod in our direction and thenthey follow him over to greet us.I know Chaff by sight because I’ve spent years watching him pass a bottle backand forth with Haymitch on television. He’s dark skinned, about six feet tall,and one of his arms ends in a stump because he lost his hand in the Games he wonthirty years ago. I’m sure they offered him some artificial replacement, likethey did Peeta when they had to amputate his lower leg, but I guess he didn’ttake it.The woman, Seeder, looks almost like she could be from the Seam, with her oliveskin and straight black hair streaked with silver. Only her golden brown eyesmark her as from another district. She must be around sixty, but she still looksstrong, and there’s no sign she’s turned to liquor or morphling or any otherchemical form of escape over the years. Before either of us says a word, sheembraces me. I know somehow it must be because of Rue and Thresh. Before I canstop myself, I whisper, “The families?”“They’re alive,” she says back softly before letting me go.Chaff throws his good arm around me and gives me a big kiss right on the mouth.I jerk back, startled, while he and Haymitch guffaw.That’s about all the time we get before the Capitol attendants are firmlydirecting us toward the elevators. I get the distinct feeling they’re notcomfortable with the camaraderie among the victors, who couldn’t seem to careless. As I walk toward the elevators, my hand still linked with Peeta’s, someoneelse rustles up to my side. The girl pulls off a headdress of leafy branches andtosses it behind her without bothering to look where it falls.Johanna Mason. From District 7. Lumber and paper, thus the tree. She won by veryconvincingly portraying herself as weak and helpless so that she would beignored. Then she demonstrated a wicked ability to murder. She ruffles up herspiky hair and rolls her wide-set brown eyes. “Isn’t my costume awful? Mystylist’s the biggest idiot in the Capitol. Our tributes have been trees forforty years under her. Wish I’d gotten Cinna. You look fantastic.”Girl talk. That thing I’ve always been so bad at. Opinions on clothes, hair,makeup. So I lie. “Yeah, he’s been helping me design my own clothing line. Youshould see what he can do with velvet.” Velvet. The only fabric I could think ofoff the top of my head.“I have. On your tour. That strapless number you wore in District Two? The deepblue one with the diamonds? So gorgeous I wanted to reach through the screen andtear it right off your back,” says Johanna.I bet you did, I think. With a few inches of my flesh.While we wait for the elevators, Johanna unzips the rest of her tree, letting itdrop to the floor, and then kicks it away in disgust. Except for her forestgreen slippers, she doesn’t have on a stitch of clothing. “That’s better.”We end up on the same elevator with her, and she spends the whole ride to theseventh floor chatting to Peeta about his paintings while the light of hisstill-glowing costume reflects off her bare breasts. When she leaves, I ignorehim, but I just know he’s grinning. I toss aside his hand as the doors closebehind Chaff and Seeder, leaving us alone, and he breaks out laughing.“What?” I say, turning on him as we step out on our floor.“It’s you, Katniss. Can’t you see?” he says.“What’s me?” I say.“Why they’re all acting like this. Finnick with his sugar cubes and Chaffkissing you and that whole thing with Johanna stripping down.” He tries to takeon a more serious tone, unsuccessfully. “They’re playing with you because you’reso . . . you know.”“No, I don’t know,” I say. And I really have no idea what he’s talking about.“It’s like when you wouldn’t look at me naked in the arena even though I washalf dead. You’re so . . . pure,” he says finally.“I am not!” I say. “I’ve been practically ripping your clothes off every timethere’s been a camera for the last year!”“Yeah, but . . . I mean, for the Capitol, you’re pure,” he says, clearly tryingto mollify me. “For me, you’re perfect. They’re just teasing you.”“No, they’re laughing at me, and so are you!” I say.“No.” Peeta shakes his head, but he’s still suppressing a smile. I’m seriouslyrethinking the question of who should get out of these Games alive when theother elevator opens.Haymitch and Effie join us, looking pleased about something. Then Haymitch’sface grows hard.What did I do now? I almost say, but I see he’s staring behind me at theentrance to the dining room.Effie blinks in the same direction, then says brightly, “Looks like they’ve gotyou a matched set this year.”I turn around and find the redheaded Avox girl who tended to me last year untilthe Games began. I think how nice it is to have a friend here. I notice that theyoung man beside her, another Avox, also has red hair. That must be what Effiemeant by a matched set.Then a chill runs through me. Because I know him, too. Not from the Capitol butfrom years of having easy conversations in the Hob, joking over Greasy Sae’ssoup, and that last day watching him lie unconscious in the square while thelife bled out of Gale.Our new Avox is Darius."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00024.jpg]Haymitch grips my wrist as if anticipating my next move, but I am as speechlessas the Capitol’s torturers have rendered Darius. Haymitch once told me they didsomething to Avoxes’ tongues so they could never talk again. In my head I hearDarius’s voice, playful and bright, ringing across the Hob to tease me. Not asmy fellow victors make fun of me now, but because we genuinely liked each other.If Gale could see him . . .I know any move I would make toward Darius, any act of recognition, would onlyresult in punishment for him. So we just stare into each other’s eyes. Darius,now a mute slave; me, now headed to death. What would we say, anyway? That we’resorry for the other’s lot? That we ache for the other’s pain? That we’re glad wehad the chance to know each other?No, Darius shouldn’t be glad he knew me. If I had been there to stop Thread, hewouldn’t have stepped forward to save Gale. Wouldn’t be an Avox. And morespecifically, wouldn’t be my Avox, because President Snow has so obviously hadhim placed here for my benefit.I twist my wrist from Haymitch’s grasp and head down to my old bedroom, lockingthe door behind me. I sit on the side of my bed, elbows on my knees, forehead onmy fists, and watch my glowing suit in the darkness, imagining I am in my oldhome in District 12, huddled beside the fire. It slowly fades back to black asthe power pack dies out.When Effie eventually knocks on the door to summon me to dinner, I get up andtake off my suit, fold it neatly, and set it on the table with my crown. In thebathroom, I wash the dark streaks of makeup from my face. I dress in a simpleshirt and pants and go down the hall to the dining room.I’m not aware of much at dinner except that Darius and the redheaded Avox girlare our servers. Effie, Haymitch, Cinna, Portia, and Peeta are all there,talking about the opening ceremonies, I suppose. But the only time I really feelpresent is when I purposely knock a dish of peas to the floor and, before anyonecan stop me, crouch down to clean them up. Darius is right by me when I send thedish over, and we two are briefly side by side, obscured from view, as we scoopup the peas. For just one moment our hands meet. I can feel his skin, roughunder the buttery sauce from the dish. In the tight, desperate clench of ourfingers are all the words we will never be able to say. Then Effie’s clucking atme from behind about how “That isn’t your job, Katniss!” and he lets go.When we go in to watch the recap of the opening cere-monies, I wedge myself inbetween Cinna and Haymitch on the couch because I don’t want to be next toPeeta. This awfulness with Darius belongs to me and Gale and maybe evenHaymitch, but not to Peeta. He might’ve known Darius to nod hello, but Peetawasn’t Hob the way the rest of us were. Besides, I’m still angry with him forlaughing at me along with the other victors, and the last thing I want is hissympathy and comfort. I haven’t changed my mind about saving him in the arena,but I don’t owe him more than that.As I watch the procession to the City Circle, I think how it’s bad enough thatthey dress us all up in costumes and parade us through the streets in chariotson a regular year. Kids in costumes are silly, but aging victors, it turns out,are pitiful. A few who are on the younger side, like Johanna and Finnick, orwhose bodies haven’t fallen into disrepair, like Seeder and Brutus, can stillmanage to maintain a little dignity. But the majority, who are in the clutchesof drink or morphling or illness, look grotesque in their costumes, depictingcows and trees and loaves of bread. Last year we chattered away about eachcontestant, but tonight there’s only the occasional comment. Small wonder thecrowd goes wild when Peeta and I appear, looking so young and strong andbeautiful in our brilliant costumes. The very image of what tributes should be.As soon as it’s over, I stand up and thank Cinna and Portia for their amazingwork and head off to bed. Effie calls a reminder to meet early for breakfast towork out our training strategy, but even her voice sounds hollow. Poor Effie.She finally had a decent year in the Games with Peeta and me, and now it’s allbroken down into a mess that even she can’t put a positive spin on. In Capitolterms, I’m guessing this counts as a true tragedy.Soon after I go to bed, there’s a quiet knock on my door, but I ignore it. Idon’t want Peeta tonight. Especially not with Darius around. It’s almost as badas if Gale were here. Gale. How am I supposed to let him go with Darius hauntingthe hallways?Tongues figure prominently in my nightmares. First I watch frozen and helplesswhile gloved hands carry out the bloody dissection in Darius’s mouth. Then I’mat a party where everyone wears masks and someone with a flicking, wet tongue,who I suppose is Finnick, stalks me, but when he catches me and pulls off hismask, it’s President Snow, and his puffy lips are dripping in bloody saliva.Finally I’m back in the arena, my own tongue as dry as sandpaper, while I try toreach a pool of water that recedes every time I’m about to touch it.When I wake, I stumble to the bathroom and gulp water from the faucet until Ican hold no more. I strip off my sweaty clothes and fall back into bed, naked,and somehow find sleep again.I delay going down to breakfast as long as possible the next morning because Ireally don’t want to discuss our training strategy. What’s to discuss? Everyvictor already knows what everybody else can do. Or used to be able to do,anyway. So Peeta and I will continue to act in love and that’s that. Somehow I’mjust not up to talking about it, especially with Darius standing mutely by. Itake a long shower, dress slowly in the outfit Cinna has left for training, andorder food from the menu in my room by speaking into a mouthpiece. In a minute,sausage, eggs, potatoes, bread, juice, and hot chocolate appear. I eat my fill,trying to drag out the minutes until ten o’clock, when we have to go down to theTraining Center. By nine-thirty, Haymitch is pounding on my door, obviously fedup with me, ordering me to the dining room NOW! Still, I brush my teeth beforemeandering down the hall, effectively killing another five minutes.The dining room’s empty except for Peeta and Haymitch, whose face is flushedwith drink and anger. On his wrist he wears a solid-gold bangle with a patternof flames — this must be his concession to Effie’s matching-token plan — that hetwists unhappily. It’s a very handsome bangle, really, but the movement makes itseem like something confining, a shackle, rather than a piece of jewelry.“You’re late,” he snarls at me.“Sorry. I slept in after the mutilated-tongue nightmares kept me up half thenight.” I mean to sound hostile, but my voice catches at the end of thesentence.Haymitch gives me a scowl, then relents. “All right, never mind. Today, intraining, you’ve got two jobs. One, stay in love.”“Obviously,” I say.“And two, make some friends,” says Haymitch.“No,” I say. “I don’t trust any of them, I can’t stand most of them, and I’drather operate with just the two of us.”“That’s what I said at first, but —” Peeta begins.“But it won’t be enough,” Haymitch insists. “You’re going to need more alliesthis time around.”“Why?” I ask.“Because you’re at a distinct disadvantage. Your competitors have known eachother for years. So who do you think they’re going to target first?” he says.“Us. And nothing we’re going to do is going to override any old friendship,” Isay. “So why bother?”“Because you can fight. You’re popular with the crowd. That could still make youdesirable allies. But only if you let the others know you’re willing to team upwith them,” says Haymitch.“You mean you want us in the Career pack this year?” I ask, unable to hide mydistaste. Traditionally the tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4 join forces,possibly taking in a few other exceptional fighters, and hunt down the weakercompetitors.“That’s been our strategy, hasn’t it? To train like Careers?” counters Haymitch.“And who makes up the Career pack is generally agreed upon before the Gamesbegin. Peeta barely got in with them last year.”I think of the loathing I felt when I discovered Peeta was with the Careersduring the last Games. “So we’re to try to get in with Finnick and Brutus — isthat what you’re saying?”“Not necessarily. Everyone’s a victor. Make your own pack if you’d rather.Choose who you like. I’d suggest Chaff and Seeder. Although Finnick’s not to beignored,” says Haymitch. “Find someone to team up with who might be of some useto you. Remember, you’re not in a ring full of trembling children anymore. Thesepeople are all experienced killers, no matter what shape they appear to be in.”Maybe he’s right. Only who could I trust? Seeder maybe. But do I really want tomake a pact with her, only to possibly have to kill her later? No. Still, I madea pact with Rue under the same circumstances. I tell Haymitch I’ll try, eventhough I think I’ll be pretty bad at the whole thing.Effie shows up a bit early to take us down because last year, even though wewere on time, we were the last two tributes to show up. But Haymitch tells herhe doesn’t want her taking us down to the gym. None of the other victors will beshowing up with a babysitter, and being the youngest, it’s even more importantwe look self-reliant. So she has to satisfy herself with taking us to theelevator, fussing over our hair, and pushing the button for us.It’s such a short ride that there’s no real time for conversation, but whenPeeta takes my hand, I don’t pull it away. I may have ignored him last night inprivate, but in training we must appear as an inseparable team.Effie needn’t have worried about us being the last to arrive. Only Brutus andthe woman from District 2, Enobaria, are present. Enobaria looks to be aboutthirty and all I can remember about her is that, in hand-to-hand combat, shekilled one tribute by ripping open his throat with her teeth. She became sofamous for this act that, after she was a victor, she had her teeth cosmeticallyaltered so each one ends in a sharp point like a fang and is inlaid with gold.She has no shortage of admirers in the Capitol.By ten o’clock, only about half of the tributes have shown up. Atala, the womanwho runs training, begins her spiel right on time, unfazed by the poorattendance. Maybe she expected it. I’m sort of relieved, because that meansthere are a dozen people I don’t have to pretend to make friends with. Atalaruns through the list of stations, which include both combat and survivalskills, and releases us to train.I tell Peeta I think we’d do best to split up, thus covering more territory.When he goes off to chuck spears with Brutus and Chaff, I head over to theknot-tying station. Hardly anyone ever bothers to visit it. I like the trainerand he remembers me fondly, maybe because I spent time with him last year. He’spleased when I show him I can still set the trap that leaves an enemy danglingby a leg from a tree. Clearly he took note of my snares in the arena last yearand now sees me as an advanced pupil, so I ask him to review every kind of knotthat might come in handy and a few that I’ll probably never use. I’d be contentto spend the morning alone with him, but after about an hour and a half, someoneputs his arms around me from behind, his fingers easily finishing thecomplicated knot I’ve been sweating over. Of course it’s Finnick, who seems tohave spent his childhood doing nothing but wielding tridents and manipulatingropes into fancy knots for nets, I guess. I watch for a minute while he picks upa length of rope, makes a noose, and then pretends to hang himself for myamusement.Rolling my eyes, I head over to another vacant station where tributes can learnto build fires. I already make excellent fires, but I’m still pretty dependenton matches for starting them. So the trainer has me work with flint, steel, andsome charred cloth. This is much harder than it looks, and even working asintently as I can, it takes me about an hour to get a fire going. I look up witha triumphant smile only to find I have company.The two tributes from District 3 are beside me, struggling to start a decentfire with matches. I think about leaving, but I really want to try using theflint again, and if I have to report back to Haymitch that I tried to makefriends, these two might be a bearable choice. Both are small in stature withashen skin and black hair. The woman, Wiress, is probably around my mother’s ageand speaks in a quiet, intelligent voice. But right away I notice she has ahabit of dropping off her words in mid-sentence, as if she’s forgotten you’rethere. Beetee, the man, is older and somewhat fidgety. He wears glasses butspends a lot of time looking under them. They’re a little strange, but I’mpretty sure neither of them is going to try to make me uncomfortable bystripping naked. And they’re from District 3. Maybe they can even confirm mysuspicions of an uprising there.I glance around the Training Center. Peeta is at the center of a ribald circleof knife throwers. The morphlings from District 6 are in the camouflage station,painting each other’s faces with bright pink swirls. The male tribute fromDistrict 5 is vomiting wine on the sword-fighting floor. Finnick and the oldwoman from his district are using the archery station. Johanna Mason is nakedagain and oiling her skin down for a wrestling lesson. I decide to stay put.Wiress and Beetee make decent company. They seem friendly enough but don’t pry.We talk about our talents; they tell me they both invent things, which makes mysupposed interest in fashion seem pretty weak. Wiress brings up some sort ofstitching device she’s working on.“It senses the density of the fabric and selects the strength,” she says, andthen becomes absorbed in a bit of dry straw before she can go on.“The strength of the thread,” Beetee finishes explaining. “Automatically. Itrules out human error.” Then he talks about his recent success creating amusical chip that’s tiny enough to be concealed in a flake of glitter but canhold hours of songs. I remember Octavia talking about this during the weddingshoot, and I see a possible chance to allude to the uprising.“Oh, yeah. My prep team was all upset a few months ago, I think, because theycouldn’t get hold of that,” I say casually. “I guess a lot of orders fromDistrict Three were getting backed up.”Beetee examines me under his glasses. “Yes. Did you have any similar backups incoal production this year?” he asks.“No. Well, we lost a couple of weeks when they brought in a new Head Peacekeeperand his crew, but nothing major,” I say. “To production, I mean. Two weekssitting around your house doing nothing just means two weeks of being hungry formost people.”I think they understand what I’m trying to say. That we’ve had no uprising. “Oh.That’s a shame,” says Wiress in a slightly disappointed voice. “I found yourdistrict very . . .” She trails off, distracted by something in her head.“Interesting,” fills in Beetee. “We both did.”I feel bad, knowing that their district must have suffered much worse than ours.I feel I have to defend my people. “Well, there aren’t very many of us inTwelve,” I say. “Not that you’d know it nowadays by the size of the Peacekeepingforce. But I guess we’re interesting enough.”As we move over to the shelter station, Wiress stops and gazes up at the standswhere the Gamemakers are roaming around, eating and drinking, sometimes takingnotice of us. “Look,” she says, giving her head a slight nod in their direction.I look up and see Plutarch Heavensbee in the magnificent purple robe with thefur-trimmed collar that designates him as Head Gamemaker. He’s eating a turkeyleg.I don’t see why this merits comment, but I say, “Yes, he’s been promoted to HeadGamemaker this year.”“No, no. There by the corner of the table. You can just . . .” says Wiress.Beetee squints under his glasses. “Just make it out.”I stare in that direction, perplexed. But then I see it. A patch of space aboutsix inches square at the corner of the table seems almost to be vibrating. It’sas if the air is rippling in tiny visible waves, distorting the sharp edges ofthe wood and a goblet of wine someone has set there.“A force field. They’ve set one up between the Gamemakers and us. I wonder whatbrought that on,” Beetee says.“Me, probably,” I confess. “Last year I shot an arrow at them during my privatetraining session.” Beetee and Wiress look at me curiously. “I was provoked. So,do all force fields have a spot like that?”“Chink,” says Wiress vaguely.“In the armor, as it were,” finishes Beetee. “Ideally it’d be invisible,wouldn’t it?”I want to ask them more, but lunch is announced. I look for Peeta, but he’shanging with a group of about ten other victors, so I decide just to eat withDistrict 3. Maybe I can get Seeder to join us.When we make our way into the dining area, I see some of Peeta’s gang have otherideas. They’re dragging all the smaller tables to form one large table so thatwe all have to eat together. Now I don’t know what to do. Even at school I usedto avoid eating at a crowded table. Frankly, I’d probably have sat alone ifMadge hadn’t made a habit of joining me. I guess I’d have eaten with Galeexcept, being two grades apart, our lunch never fell at the same time.I take a tray and start making my way around the food-laden carts that ring theroom. Peeta catches up with me at the stew. “How’s it going?”“Good. Fine. I like the District Three victors,” I say. “Wiress and Beetee.”“Really?” he asks. “They’re something of a joke to the others.”“Why does that not surprise me?” I say. I think of how Peeta was alwayssurrounded at school by a crowd of friends. It’s amazing, really, that he evertook any notice of me except to think I was odd.“Johanna’s nicknamed them Nuts and Volts,” he says. “I think she’s Nuts and he’sVolts.”“And so I’m stupid for thinking they might be useful. Because of somethingJohanna Mason said while she was oiling up her breasts for wrestling,” I retort.“Actually I think the nickname’s been around for years. And I didn’t mean thatas an insult. I’m just sharing information,” he says.“Well, Wiress and Beetee are smart. They invent things. They could tell by sightthat a force field had been put up between us and the Gamemakers. And if we haveto have allies, I want them.” I toss the ladle back in a pot of stew,splattering us both with the gravy.“What are you so angry about?” Peeta asks, wiping the gravy from his shirtfront.“Because I teased you on the elevator? I’m sorry. I thought you would just laughabout it.”“Forget it,” I say with a shake of my head. “It’s a lot of things.”“Darius,” he says.“Darius. The Games. Haymitch making us team up with the others,” I say.“It can just be you and me, you know,” he says.“I know. But maybe Haymitch is right,” I say. “Don’t tell him I said so, but heusually is, where the Games are concerned.”“Well, you can have final say about our allies. But right now, I’m leaningtoward Chaff and Seeder,” says Peeta.“I’m okay with Seeder, not Chaff,” I say. “Not yet, anyway.”“Come on and eat with him. I promise, I won’t let him kiss you again,” saysPeeta.Chaff doesn’t seem as bad at lunch. He’s sober, and while he talks too loud andmakes bad jokes a lot, most of them are at his own expense. I can see why hewould be good for Haymitch, whose thoughts run so darkly. But I’m still not sureI’m ready to team up with him.I try hard to be more sociable, not just with Chaff but with the group at large.After lunch I do the edible-insect station with the District 8 tributes —Cecelia, who’s got three kids at home, and Woof, a really old guy who’s hard ofhearing and doesn’t seem to know what’s going on since he keeps trying to stuffpoisonous bugs in his mouth. I wish I could mention meeting Twill and Bonnie inthe woods, but I can’t figure out how. Cashmere and Gloss, the sister andbrother from District 1, invite me over and we make hammocks for a while.They’re polite but cool, and I spend the whole time thinking about how I killedboth the tributes from their district, Glimmer and Marvel, last year, and thatthey probably knew them and might even have been their mentors. Both my hammockand my attempt to connect with them are mediocre at best. I join Enobaria atsword training and exchange a few comments, but it’s clear neither of us wantsto team up. Finnick appears again when I’m picking up fishing tips, but mostlyjust to introduce me to Mags, the elderly woman who’s also from District 4.Between her district accent and her garbled speech — possibly she’s had a stroke— I can’t make out more than one in four words. But I swear she can make adecent fishhook out of anything — a thorn, a wishbone, an earring. After a whileI tune out the trainer and simply try to copy whatever Mags does. When I make apretty good hook out of a bent nail and fasten it to some strands of my hair,she gives me a toothless smile and an unintelligible comment I think might bepraise. Suddenly I remember how she volunteered to replace the young, hystericalwoman in her district. It couldn’t be because she thought she had any chance ofwinning. She did it to save the girl, just like I volunteered last year to savePrim. And I decide I want her on my team.Great. Now I have to go back and tell Haymitch I want an eighty-year-old andNuts and Volts for my allies. He’ll love that.So I give up trying to make friends and go over to the archery range for somesanity. It’s wonderful there, getting to try out all the different bows andarrows. The trainer, Tax, seeing that the standing targets offer no challengefor me, begins to launch these silly fake birds high into the air for me to hit.At first it seems stupid, but it turns out to be kind of fun. Much more likehunting a moving creature. Since I’m hitting everything he throws up, he startsincreasing the number of birds he sends airborne. I forget the rest of the gymand the victors and how miserable I am and lose myself in the shooting. When Imanage to take down five birds in one round, I realize it’s so quiet I can heareach one hit the floor. I turn and see the majority of the victors have stoppedto watch me. Their faces show everything from envy to hatred to admiration.After training, Peeta and I hang out, waiting for Haymitch and Effie to show upfor dinner. When we’re called to eat, Haymitch pounces on me immediately. “So atleast half the victors have instructed their mentors to request you as an ally.I know it can’t be your sunny personality.”“They saw her shoot,” says Peeta with a smile. “Actually, I saw her shoot, forreal, for the first time. I’m about to put in a formal request myself.”“You’re that good?” Haymitch asks me. “So good that Brutus wants you?”I shrug. “But I don’t want Brutus. I want Mags and District Three.”“Of course you do.” Haymitch sighs and orders a bottle of wine. “I’ll telleverybody you’re still making up your mind.”After my shooting exhibition, I still get teased some, but I no longer feel likeI’m being mocked. In fact, I feel as if I’ve somehow been initiated into thevictors’ circle. During the next two days, I spend time with almost everybodyheaded for the arena. Even the morphlings, who, with Peeta’s help, paint me intoa field of yellow flowers. Even Finnick, who gives me an hour of trident lessonsin exchange for an hour of archery instruction. And the more I come to knowthese people, the worse it is. Because, on the whole, I don’t hate them. Andsome I like. And a lot of them are so damaged that my natural instinct would beto protect them. But all of them must die if I’m to save Peeta.The final day of training ends with our private sessions. We each get fifteenminutes before the Gamemakers to amaze them with our skills, but I don’t knowwhat any of us might have to show them. There’s a lot of kidding about it atlunch. What we might do. Sing, dance, strip, tell jokes. Mags, who I canunderstand a little better now, decides she’s just going to take a nap. I don’tknow what I’m going to do. Shoot some arrows, I guess. Haymitch said to surprisethem if we could, but I’m fresh out of ideas.As the girl from 12, I’m scheduled to go last. The dining room gets quieter andquieter as the tributes file out to go perform. It’s easier to keep up theirreverent, invincible manner we’ve all adopted when there are more of us. Aspeople disappear through the door, all I can think is that they have a matter ofdays to live.Peeta and I are finally left alone. He reaches across the table to take myhands. “Decided what to do for the Gamemakers yet?”I shake my head. “I can’t really use them for target practice this year, withthe force field up and all. Maybe make some fishhooks. What about you?”“Not a clue. I keep wishing I could bake a cake or something,” he says.“Do some more camouflage,” I suggest.“If the morphlings have left me anything to work with,” he says wryly. “They’vebeen glued to that station since training started.”We sit in silence awhile and then I blurt out the thing that’s on both ourminds. “How are we going to kill these people, Peeta?”“I don’t know.” He leans his forehead down on our entwined hands.“I don’t want them as allies. Why did Haymitch want us to get to know them?” Isay. “It’ll make it so much harder than last time. Except for Rue maybe. But Iguess I never really could’ve killed her, anyway. She was just too much likePrim.”Peeta looks up at me, his brow creased in thought. “Her death was the mostdespicable, wasn’t it?”“None of them were very pretty,” I say, thinking of Glimmer’s and Cato’s ends.They call Peeta, so I wait by myself. Fifteen minutes pass. Then half an hour.It’s close to forty minutes before I’m called.When I go in, I smell the sharp odor of cleaner and notice that one of the matshas been dragged to the center of the room. The mood is very different from lastyear’s, when the Gamemakers were half drunk and distractedly picking at tidbitsfrom the banquet table. They whisper among themselves, looking somewhat annoyed.What did Peeta do? Something to upset them?I feel a pang of worry. That isn’t good. I don’t want Peeta singling himself outas a target for the Gamemakers’ anger. That’s part of my job. To draw fire awayfrom Peeta. But how did he upset them? Because I’d love to do just that andmore. To break through the smug veneer of those who use their brains to findamusing ways to kill us. To make them realize that while we’re vulnerable to theCapitol’s cruelties, they are as well.Do you have any idea how much I hate you? I think. You, who have given yourtalents to the Games?I try to catch Plutarch Heavensbee’s eye, but he seems to be intentionallyignoring me, as he has the entire training period. I remember how he sought meout for a dance, how pleased he was to show me the mockingjay on his watch. Hisfriendly manner has no place here. How could it, when I’m a mere tribute andhe’s the Head Gamemaker? So powerful, so removed, so safe . . .Suddenly I know just what I’m going to do. Something that will blow anythingPeeta did right out of the water. I go over to the knot-tying station and get alength of rope. I start to manipulate it, but it’s hard because I’ve never madethis actual knot myself. I’ve only watched Finnick’s clever fingers, and theymoved so fast. After about ten minutes, I’ve come up with a respectable noose. Idrag one of the target dummies out into the middle of the room and, using somechinning bars, hang it so it dangles by the neck. Tying its hands behind itsback would be a nice touch, but I think I might be running out of time. I hurryover to the camouflage station, where some of the other tributes, undoubtedlythe morphlings, have made a colossal mess. But I find a partial container ofbloodred berry juice that will serve my needs. The flesh-colored fabric of thedummy’s skin makes a good, absorbent canvas. I carefully finger paint the wordson its body, concealing them from view. Then I step away quickly to watch thereaction on the Gamemakers’ faces as they read the name on the dummy."},{"pageContent":"SENECA CRANE."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00019.jpg]The effect on the Gamemakers is immediate and satisfying. Several let out smallshrieks. Others lose their grips on their wineglasses, which shatter musicallyagainst the ground. Two seem to be considering fainting. The look of shock isunanimous.Now I have Plutarch Heavensbee’s attention. He stares steadily at me as thejuice from the peach he crushed in his hand runs through his fingers. Finally heclears his throat and says, “You may go now, Miss Everdeen.”I give a respectful nod and turn to go, but at the last moment I can’t resisttossing the container of berry juice over my shoulder. I can hear the contentssplatter against the dummy while a couple more wineglasses break. As theelevator doors close before me, I see no one has moved.That surprised them, I think. It was rash and dangerous and no doubt I will payfor it ten times over. But for the moment, I feel something close to elation andI let myself savor it.I want to find Haymitch immediately and tell him about my session, but no one’saround. I guess they’re getting ready for dinner and I decide to go take ashower myself, since my hands are stained from the juice. As I stand in thewater, I begin to wonder about the wisdom of my latest trick. The question thatshould now always be my guide is “Will this help Peeta stay alive?” Indirectly,this might not. What happens in training is highly secretive, so there’s nopoint in taking action against me when no one will know what my transgressionwas. In fact, last year I was rewarded for my brashness. This is a differentsort of crime, though. If the Gamemakers are angry with me and decide to punishme in the arena, Peeta could get caught up in the attack as well. Maybe it wastoo impulsive. Still . . . I can’t say I’m sorry I did it.As we all gather for dinner, I notice Peeta’s hands are faintly stained with avariety of colors, even though his hair is still damp from bathing. He must havedone some form of camouflage after all. Once the soup is served, Haymitch getsright to the issue on everyone’s mind. “All right, so how did your privatesessions go?”I exchange a look with Peeta. Somehow I’m not that eager to put what I did intowords. In the calm of the dining room, it seems very extreme. “You first,” I sayto him. “It must have been really special. I had to wait for forty minutes to goin.”Peeta seems to be struck with the same reluctance I’m experiencing. “Well, I — Idid the camouflage thing, like you suggested, Katniss.” He hesitates. “Notexactly camouflage. I mean, I used the dyes.”“To do what?” asks Portia.I think of how ruffled the Gamemakers were when I entered the gym for mysession. The smell of cleaners. The mat pulled over that spot in the center ofthe gym. Was it to conceal something they were unable to wash away? “You paintedsomething, didn’t you? A picture.”“Did you see it?” Peeta asks.“No. But they’d made a real point of covering it up,” I say.“Well, that would be standard. They can’t let one tribute know what anotherdid,” says Effie, unconcerned. “What did you paint, Peeta?” She looks a littlemisty. “Was it a picture of Katniss?”“Why would he paint a picture of me, Effie?” I ask, somehow annoyed.“To show he’s going to do everything he can to defend you. That’s what everyonein the Capitol’s expecting, anyway. Didn’t he volunteer to go in with you?”Effie says, as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world.“Actually, I painted a picture of Rue,” Peeta says. “How she looked afterKatniss had covered her in flowers.”There’s a long pause at the table while everyone absorbs this. “And what exactlywere you trying to accomplish?” Haymitch asks in a very measured voice.“I’m not sure. I just wanted to hold them accountable, if only for a moment,”says Peeta. “For killing that little girl.”“This is dreadful.” Effie sounds like she’s about to cry. “That sort of thinking. . . it’s forbidden, Peeta. Absolutely. You’ll only bring down more trouble onyourself and Katniss.”“I have to agree with Effie on this one,” says Haymitch. Portia and Cinna remainsilent, but their faces are very serious. Of course, they’re right. But eventhough it worries me, I think what he did was amazing.“I guess this is a bad time to mention I hung a dummy and painted Seneca Crane’sname on it,” I say. This has the desired effect. After a moment of disbelief,all the disapproval in the room hits me like a ton of bricks.“You . . . hung . . . Seneca Crane?” says Cinna.“Yes. I was showing off my new knot-tying skills, and he somehow ended up at theend of the noose,” I say.“Oh, Katniss,” says Effie in a hushed voice. “How do you even know about that?”“Is it a secret? President Snow didn’t act like it was. In fact, he seemed eagerfor me to know,” I say. Effie leaves the table with her napkin pressed to herface. “Now I’ve upset Effie. I should have lied and said I shot some arrows.”“You’d have thought we planned it,” says Peeta, giving me just the hint of asmile.“Didn’t you?” asks Portia. Her fingers press her eyelids closed as if she’swarding off a very bright light.“No,” I say, looking at Peeta with a new sense of appreciation. “Neither of useven knew what we were going to do before we went in.”“And, Haymitch?” says Peeta. “We decided we don’t want any other allies in thearena.”“Good. Then I won’t be responsible for you killing off any of my friends withyour stupidity,” he says.“That’s just what we were thinking,” I tell him.We finish the meal in silence, but when we rise to go into the sitting room,Cinna puts his arm around me and gives me a squeeze. “Come on and let’s go getthose training scores.”We gather around the television set and a red-eyed Effie rejoins us. Thetributes’ faces come up, district by district, and their scores flash undertheir pictures. One through twelve. Predictably high scores for Cashmere, Gloss,Brutus, Enobaria, and Finnick. Low to medium for the rest.“Have they ever given a zero?” I ask.“No, but there’s a first time for everything,” Cinna answers.And it turns out he’s right. Because when Peeta and I each pull a twelve, wemake Hunger Games history. No one feels like celebrating, though.“Why did they do that?” I ask.“So that the others will have no choice but to target you,” says Haymitchflatly. “Go to bed. I can’t stand to look at either one of you.”Peeta walks me down to my room in silence, but before he can say good night, Iwrap my arms around him and rest my head against his chest. His hands slide upmy back and his cheek leans against my hair. “I’m sorry if I made things worse,”I say.“No worse than I did. Why did you do it, anyway?” he says.“I don’t know. To show them that I’m more than just a piece in their Games?” Isay.He laughs a little, no doubt remembering the night before the Games last year.We were on the roof, neither of us able to sleep. Peeta had said something ofthe sort then, but I hadn’t understood what he meant. Now I do.“Me, too,” he tells me. “And I’m not saying I’m not going to try. To get youhome, I mean. But if I’m perfectly honest about it . . .”“If you’re perfectly honest about it, you think President Snow has probablygiven them direct orders to make sure we die in the arena anyway,” I say.“It’s crossed my mind,” says Peeta.It’s crossed my mind, too. Repeatedly. But while I know I’ll never leave thatarena alive, I’m still holding on to the hope that Peeta will. After all, hedidn’t pull out those berries, I did. No one has ever doubted that Peeta’sdefiance was motivated by love. So maybe President Snow will prefer keeping himalive, crushed and heartbroken, as a living warning to others.“But even if that happens, everyone will know we’ve gone out fighting, right?”Peeta asks.“Everyone will,” I reply. And for the first time, I distance myself from thepersonal tragedy that has consumed me since they announced the Quell. I rememberthe old man they shot in District 11, and Bonnie and Twill, and the rumoreduprisings. Yes, everyone in the districts will be watching me to see how Ihandle this death sentence, this final act of President Snow’s dominance. Theywill be looking for some sign that their battles have not been in vain. If I canmake it clear that I’m still defying the Capitol right up to the end, theCapitol will have killed me . . . but not my spirit. What better way to givehope to the rebels?The beauty of this idea is that my decision to keep Peeta alive at the expenseof my own life is itself an act of defiance. A refusal to play the Hunger Gamesby the Capitol’s rules. My private agenda dovetails completely with my publicone. And if I really could save Peeta . . . in terms of a revolution, this wouldbe ideal. Because I will be more valuable dead. They can turn me into some kindof martyr for the cause and paint my face on banners, and it will do more torally people than anything I could do if I was living. But Peeta would be morevaluable alive, and tragic, because he will be able to turn his pain into wordsthat will transform people.Peeta would lose it if he knew I was thinking any of this, so I only say, “Sowhat should we do with our last few days?”“I just want to spend every possible minute of the rest of my life with you,”Peeta replies.“Come on, then,” I say, pulling him into my room.It feels like such a luxury, sleeping with Peeta again. I didn’t realize untilnow how starved I’ve been for human closeness. For the feel of him beside me inthe darkness. I wish I hadn’t wasted the last couple of nights shutting him out.I sink down into sleep, enveloped in his warmth, and when I open my eyes again,daylight’s streaming through the windows.“No nightmares,” he says.“No nightmares,” I confirm. “You?”“None. I’d forgotten what a real night’s sleep feels like,” he says.We lie there for a while, in no rush to begin the day. Tomorrow night will bethe televised interview, so today Effie and Haymitch should be coaching us. Morehigh heels and sarcastic comments, I think. But then the redheaded Avox girlcomes in with a note from Effie saying that, given our recent tour, both she andHaymitch have agreed we can handle ourselves adequately in public. The coachingsessions have been canceled.“Really?” says Peeta, taking the note from my hand and examining it. “Do youknow what this means? We’ll have the whole day to ourselves.”“It’s too bad we can’t go somewhere,” I say wistfully.“Who says we can’t?” he asks.The roof. We order a bunch of food, grab some blankets, and head up to the rooffor a picnic. A daylong picnic in the flower garden that tinkles with windchimes. We eat. We lie in the sun. I snap off hanging vines and use my newfoundknowledge from training to practice knots and weave nets. Peeta sketches me. Wemake up a game with the force field that surrounds the roof — one of us throwsan apple into it and the other person has to catch it.No one bothers us. By late afternoon, I lie with my head on Peeta’s lap, makinga crown of flowers while he fiddles with my hair, claiming he’s practicing hisknots. After a while, his hands go still. “What?” I ask.“I wish I could freeze this moment, right here, right now, and live in itforever,” he says.Usually this sort of comment, the kind that hints of his undying love for me,makes me feel guilty and awful. But I feel so warm and relaxed and beyondworrying about a future I’ll never have, I just let the word slip out. “Okay.”I can hear the smile in his voice. “Then you’ll allow it?”“I’ll allow it,” I say.His fingers go back to my hair and I doze off, but he rouses me to see thesunset. It’s a spectacular yellow and orange blaze behind the skyline of theCapitol. “I didn’t think you’d want to miss it,” he says.“Thanks,” I say. Because I can count on my fingers the number of sunsets I haveleft, and I don’t want to miss any of them.We don’t go and join the others for dinner, and no one summons us.“I’m glad. I’m tired of making everyone around me so miserable,” says Peeta.“Everybody crying. Or Haymitch . . .”He doesn’t need to go on.We stay on the roof until bedtime and then quietly slip down to my room withoutencountering anyone.The next morning, we’re roused by my prep team. The sight of Peeta and mesleeping together is too much for Octavia, because she bursts into tears rightaway. “You remember what Cinna told us,” Venia says fiercely. Octavia nods andgoes out sobbing.Peeta has to return to his room for prep, and I’m left alone with Venia andFlavius. The usual chatter has been suspended. In fact, there’s little talk atall, other than to have me raise my chin or comment on a makeup technique. It’snearly lunch when I feel something dripping on my shoulder and turn to findFlavius, who’s snipping away at my hair with silent tears running down his face.Venia gives him a look, and he gently sets the scissors on the table and leaves.Then it’s just Venia, whose skin is so pale her tattoos appear to be leaping offit. Almost rigid with determination, she does my hair and nails and makeup,fingers flying swiftly to compensate for her absent teammates. The whole time,she avoids my gaze. It’s only when Cinna shows up to approve me and dismiss herthat she takes my hands, looks me straight in the eye, and says, “We would alllike you to know what a . . . privilege it has been to make you look your best.”Then she hastens from the room.My prep team. My foolish, shallow, affectionate pets, with their obsessions withfeathers and parties, nearly break my heart with their good-bye. It’s certainfrom Venia’s last words that we all know I won’t be returning. Does the wholeworld know it? I wonder. I look at Cinna. He knows, certainly. But as hepromised, there’s no danger of tears from him.“So, what am I wearing tonight?” I ask, eyeing the garment bag that holds mydress.“President Snow put in the dress order himself,” says Cinna. He unzips the bag,revealing one of the wedding dresses I wore for the photo shoot. Heavy whitesilk with a low neckline and tight waist and sleeves that fall from my wrists tothe floor. And pearls. Everywhere pearls. Stitched into the dress and in ropesat my throat and forming the crown for the veil. “Even though they announced theQuarter Quell the night of the photo shoot, people still voted for theirfavorite dress, and this was the winner. The president says you’re to wear ittonight. Our objections were ignored.”I rub a bit of the silk between my fingers, trying to figure out PresidentSnow’s reasoning. I suppose since I was the greatest offender, my pain and lossand humiliation should be in the brightest spotlight. This, he thinks, will makethat clear. It’s so barbaric, the president turning my bridal gown into myshroud, that the blow strikes home, leaving me with a dull ache inside. “Well,it’d be a shame to waste such a pretty dress” is all I say.Cinna helps me carefully into the gown. As it settles on my shoulders, theycan’t help giving a shrug of complaint. “Was it always this heavy?” I ask. Iremember several of the dresses being dense, but this one feels like it weighs aton.“I had to make some slight alterations because of the lighting,” says Cinna. Inod, but I can’t see what that has to do with anything. He decks me out in theshoes and the pearl jewelry and the veil. Touches up my makeup. Has me walk.“You’re ravishing,” he says. “Now, Katniss, because this bodice is so fitted, Idon’t want you raising your arms above your head. Well, not until you twirl,anyway.”“Will I be twirling again?” I ask, thinking of my dress last year.“I’m sure Caesar will ask you. And if he doesn’t, you suggest it yourself. Onlynot right away. Save it for your big finale,” Cinna instructs me.“You give me a signal so I know when,” I say.“All right. Any plans for your interview? I know Haymitch left you two to yourown devices,” he says.“No, this year I’m just winging it. The funny thing is, I’m not nervous at all.”And I’m not. However much President Snow may hate me, this Capitol audience ismine.We meet up with Effie, Haymitch, Portia, and Peeta at the elevator. Peeta’s inan elegant tuxedo and white gloves. The sort of thing grooms wear to get marriedin, here in the Capitol.Back home everything is so much simpler. A woman usually rents a white dressthat’s been worn hundreds of times. The man wears something clean that’s notmining clothes. They fill out some forms at the Justice Building and areassigned a house. Family and friends gather for a meal or bit of cake, if it canbe afforded. Even if it can’t, there’s always a traditional song we sing as thenew couple crosses the threshold of their home. And we have our own littleceremony, where they make their first fire, toast a bit of bread, and share it.Maybe it’s old-fashioned, but no one really feels married in District 12 untilafter the toasting.The other tributes have already gathered offstage and are talking softly, butwhen Peeta and I arrive, they fall silent. I realize everyone’s staring daggersat my wedding dress. Are they jealous of its beauty? The power it might have tomanipulate the crowd?Finally Finnick says, “I can’t believe Cinna put you in that thing.”“He didn’t have any choice. President Snow made him,” I say, somewhatdefensively. I won’t let anyone criticize Cinna.Cashmere tosses her flowing blond curls back and spits out, “Well, you lookridiculous!” She grabs her brother’s hand and pulls him into place to lead ourprocession onto the stage. The other tributes begin to line up as well. I’mconfused because, while they all are angry, some are giving us sympathetic patson the shoulder, and Johanna Mason actually stops to straighten my pearlnecklace.“Make him pay for it, okay?” she says.I nod, but I don’t know what she means. Not until we’re all sitting out onstageand Caesar Flickerman, hair and face highlighted in lavender this year, has donehis opening spiel and the tributes begin their interviews. This is the firsttime I realize the depth of betrayal felt among the victors and the rage thataccompanies it. But they are so smart, so wonderfully smart about how they playit, because it all comes back to reflect on the government and President Snow inparticular. Not everyone. There are the old throwbacks, like Brutus andEnobaria, who are just here for another Games, and those too baffled or druggedor lost to join in on the attack. But there are enough victors who still havethe wits and the nerve to come out fighting.Cashmere starts the ball rolling with a speech about how she just can’t stopcrying when she thinks of how much the people in the Capitol must be sufferingbecause they will lose us. Gloss recalls the kindness shown here to him and hissister. Beetee questions the legality of the Quell in his nervous, twitchy way,wondering if it’s been fully examined by experts of late. Finnick recites a poemhe wrote to his one true love in the Capitol, and about a hundred people faintbecause they’re sure he means them. By the time Johanna Mason gets up, she’sasking if something can’t be done about the situation. Surely the creators ofthe Quarter Quell never anticipated such love forming between the victors andthe Capitol. No one could be so cruel as to sever such a deep bond. Seederquietly ruminates about how, back in District 11, everyone assumes PresidentSnow is all-powerful. So if he’s all-powerful, why doesn’t he change the Quell?And Chaff, who comes right on her heels, insists the president could change theQuell if he wanted to, but he must not think it matters much to anyone.By the time I’m introduced, the audience is an absolute wreck. People have beenweeping and collapsing and even calling for change. The sight of me in my whitesilk bridal gown practically causes a riot. No more me, no more star-crossedlovers living happily ever after, no more wedding. I can see even Caesar’sprofessionalism showing some cracks as he tries to quiet them so I can speak,but my three minutes are ticking quickly away.Finally there’s a lull and he gets out, “So, Katniss, obviously this is a veryemotional night for everyone. Is there anything you’d like to say?”My voice trembles as I speak. “Only that I’m so sorry you won’t get to be at mywedding . . . but I’m glad you at least get to see me in my dress. Isn’t it just. . . the most beautiful thing?” I don’t have to look at Cinna for a signal. Iknow this is the right time. I begin to twirl slowly, raising the sleeves of myheavy gown above my head.When I hear the screams of the crowd, I think it’s because I must look stunning.Then I notice something is rising up around me. Smoke. From fire. Not theflickery stuff I wore last year in the chariot, but something much more realthat devours my dress. I begin to panic as the smoke thickens. Charred bits ofblack silk swirl into the air, and pearls clatter to the stage. Somehow I’mafraid to stop because my flesh doesn’t seem to be burning and I know Cinna mustbe behind whatever is happening. So I keep spinning and spinning. For a splitsecond I’m gasping, completely engulfed in the strange flames. Then all at once,the fire is gone. I slowly come to a stop, wondering if I’m naked and why Cinnahas arranged to burn away my wedding dress.But I’m not naked. I’m in a dress of the exact design of my wedding dress, onlyit’s the color of coal and made of tiny feathers. Wonderingly, I lift my long,flowing sleeves into the air, and that’s when I see myself on the televisionscreen. Clothed in black except for the white patches on my sleeves. Or should Isay my wings.Because Cinna has turned me into a mockingjay."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00023.jpg]I’m still smoldering a little, so it’s with a tentative hand that Caesar reachesout to touch my headpiece. The white has burned away, leaving a smooth, fittedveil of black that drapes into the neckline of the dress in the back.“Feathers,” says Caesar. “You’re like a bird.”“A mockingjay, I think,” I say, giving my wings a small flap. “It’s the bird onthe pin I wear as a token.”A shadow of recognition flickers across Caesar’s face, and I can tell he knowsthat the mockingjay isn’t just my token. That it’s come to symbolize so muchmore. That what will be seen as a flashy costume change in the Capitol isresonating in an entirely different way throughout the districts. But he makesthe best of it.“Well, hats off to your stylist. I don’t think anyone can argue that that’s notthe most spectacular thing we’ve ever seen in an interview. Cinna, I think youbetter take a bow!” Caesar gestures for Cinna to rise. He does, and makes asmall, gracious bow. And suddenly I am so afraid for him. What has he done?Something terribly dangerous. An act of rebellion in itself. And he’s done itfor me. I remember his words . . .“Don’t worry. I always channel my emotions into my work. That way I don’t hurtanyone but myself.”. . . and I’m afraid he has hurt himself beyond repair. The significance of myfiery transformation will not be lost on President Snow.The audience, who’s been stunned into silence, breaks into wild applause. I canbarely hear the buzzer that indicates that my three minutes are up. Caesarthanks me and I go back to my seat, my dress now feeling lighter than air.As I pass Peeta, who’s headed for his interview, he doesn’t meet my eyes. I takemy seat carefully, but aside from the puffs of smoke here and there, I seemunharmed, so I turn my attention to him.Caesar and Peeta have been a natural team since they first appeared together ayear ago. Their easy give-and-take, comic timing, and ability to segue intoheart-wrenching moments, like Peeta’s confession of love for me, have made thema huge success with the audience. They effortlessly open with a few jokes aboutfires and feathers and overcooking poultry. But anyone can see that Peeta ispreoccupied, so Caesar directs the conversation right into the subject that’s oneveryone’s minds.“So, Peeta, what was it like when, after all you’ve been through, you found outabout the Quell?” asks Caesar.“I was in shock. I mean, one minute I’m seeing Katniss looking so beautiful inall these wedding gowns, and the next . . .” Peeta trails off.“You realized there was never going to be a wedding?” asks Caesar gently.Peeta pauses for a long moment, as if deciding something. He looks out at thespellbound audience, then at the floor, then finally up at Caesar. “Caesar, doyou think all our friends here can keep a secret?”An uncomfortable laugh emanates from the audience. What can he mean? Keep asecret from who? Our whole world is watching.“I feel quite certain of it,” says Caesar.“We’re already married,” says Peeta quietly. The crowd reacts in astonishment,and I have to bury my face in the folds of my skirt so they can’t see myconfusion. Where on earth is he going with this?“But . . . how can that be?” asks Caesar.“Oh, it’s not an official marriage. We didn’t go to the Justice Building oranything. But we have this marriage ritual in District Twelve. I don’t know whatit’s like in the other districts. But there’s this thing we do,” says Peeta, andhe briefly describes the toasting.“Were your families there?” asks Caesar.“No, we didn’t tell anyone. Not even Haymitch. And Katniss’s mother would neverhave approved. But you see, we knew if we were married in the Capitol, therewouldn’t be a toasting. And neither of us really wanted to wait any longer. Soone day, we just did it,” Peeta says. “And to us, we’re more married than anypiece of paper or big party could make us.”“So this was before the Quell?” says Caesar.“Of course before the Quell. I’m sure we’d never have done it after we knew,”says Peeta, starting to get upset. “But who could’ve seen it coming? No one. Wewent through the Games, we were victors, everyone seemed so thrilled to see ustogether, and then out of nowhere — I mean, how could we anticipate a thing likethat?”“You couldn’t, Peeta.” Caesar puts an arm around his shoulders. “As you say, noone could’ve. But I have to confess, I’m glad you two had at least a few monthsof happiness together.”Enormous applause. As if encouraged, I look up from my feathers and let theaudience see my tragic smile of thanks. The residual smoke from the feathers hasmade my eyes teary, which adds a very nice touch.“I’m not glad,” says Peeta. “I wish we had waited until the whole thing was doneofficially.”This takes even Caesar aback. “Surely even a brief time is better than no time?”“Maybe I’d think that, too, Caesar,” says Peeta bitterly, “if it weren’t for thebaby.”There. He’s done it again. Dropped a bomb that wipes out the efforts of everytribute who came before him. Well, maybe not. Maybe this year he has only litthe fuse on a bomb that the victors themselves have been building. Hopingsomeone would be able to detonate it. Perhaps thinking it would be me in mybridal gown. Not knowing how much I rely on Cinna’s talents, whereas Peeta needsnothing more than his wits.As the bomb explodes, it sends accusations of injustice and barbarism andcruelty flying out in every direction. Even the most Capitol-loving,Games-hungry, bloodthirsty person out there can’t ignore, at least for a moment,how horrific the whole thing is.I am pregnant.The audience can’t absorb the news right away. It has to strike them and sink inand be confirmed by other voices before they begin to sound like a herd ofwounded animals, moaning, shrieking, calling for help. And me? I know my face isprojected in a tight close-up on the screen, but I don’t make any effort to hideit. Because for a moment, even I am working through what Peeta has said. Isn’tit the thing I dreaded most about the wedding, about the future — the loss of mychildren to the Games? And it could be true now, couldn’t it? If I hadn’t spentmy life building up layers of defenses until I recoil at even the suggestion ofmarriage or a family?Caesar can’t rein in the crowd again, not even when the buzzer sounds. Peetanods his good-bye and comes back to his seat without any more conversation. Ican see Caesar’s lips moving, but the place is in total chaos and I can’t hear aword. Only the blast of the anthem, cranked up so loud I can feel it vibratingthrough my bones, lets us know where we stand in the program. I automaticallyrise and, as I do, I sense Peeta reaching out for me. Tears run down his face asI take his hand. How real are the tears? Is this an acknowledgment that he hasbeen stalked by the same fears that I have? That every victor has? Every parentin every district in Panem?I look back to the crowd, but the faces of Rue’s mother and father swim beforemy eyes. Their sorrow. Their loss. I turn spontaneously to Chaff and offer myhand. I feel my fingers close around the stump that now completes his arm andhold fast.And then it happens. Up and down the row, the victors begin to join hands. Someright away, like the morphlings, or Wiress and Beetee. Others unsure but caughtup in the demands of those around them, like Brutus and Enobaria. By the timethe anthem plays its final strains, all twenty-four of us stand in one unbrokenline in what must be the first public show of unity among the districts sincethe Dark Days. You can see the realization of this as the screens begin to popinto blackness. It’s too late, though. In the confusion they didn’t cut us offin time. Everyone has seen.There’s disorder on the stage now, too, as the lights go out and we’re left tostumble back into the Training Center. I’ve lost hold of Chaff, but Peeta guidesme into an elevator. Finnick and Johanna try to join us, but a harriedPeacekeeper blocks their way and we shoot upward alone.The moment we step off the elevator, Peeta grips my shoulders. “There isn’t muchtime, so tell me. Is there anything I have to apologize for?”“Nothing,” I say. It was a big leap to take without my okay, but I’m just asglad I didn’t know, didn’t have time to second-guess him, to let any guilt overGale detract from how I really feel about what Peeta did. Which is empowered.Somewhere, very far off, is a place called District 12, where my mother andsister and friends will have to deal with the fallout from this night. Just abrief hovercraft ride away is an arena where, tomorrow, Peeta and I and theother tributes will face our own form of punishment. But even if all of us meetterrible ends, something happened on that stage tonight that can’t be undone. Wevictors staged our own uprising, and maybe, just maybe, the Capitol won’t beable to contain this one.We wait for the others to return, but when the elevator opens, only Haymitchappears. “It’s madness out there. Everyone’s been sent home and they’ve canceledthe recap of the interviews on television.”Peeta and I hurry to the window and try to make sense of the commotion far belowus on the streets. “What are they saying?” Peeta asks. “Are they asking thepresident to stop the Games?”“I don’t think they know themselves what to ask. The whole situation isunprecedented. Even the idea of opposing the Capitol’s agenda is a source ofconfusion for the people here,” says Haymitch. “But there’s no way Snow wouldcancel the Games. You know that, right?”I do. Of course, he could never back down now. The only option left to him is tostrike back, and strike back hard. “The others went home?” I ask.“They were ordered to. I don’t know how much luck they’re having getting throughthe mob,” says Haymitch.“Then we’ll never see Effie again,” says Peeta. We didn’t see her on the morningof the Games last year. “You’ll give her our thanks.”“More than that. Really make it special. It’s Effie, after all,” I say. “Tellher how appreciative we are and how she was the best escort ever and tell her .. . tell her we send our love.”For a while we just stand there in silence, delaying the inevitable. ThenHaymitch says it. “I guess this is where we say our good-byes as well.”“Any last words of advice?” Peeta asks.“Stay alive,” Haymitch says gruffly. That’s almost an old joke with us now. Hegives us each a quick embrace, and I can tell it’s all he can stand. “Go to bed.You need your rest.”I know I should say a whole bunch of things to Haymitch, but I can’t think ofanything he doesn’t already know, really, and my throat is so tight I doubtanything would come out, anyway. So, once again, I let Peeta speak for us both.“You take care, Haymitch,” he says.We cross the room, but in the doorway, Haymitch’s voice stops us. “Katniss, whenyou’re in the arena,” he begins. Then he pauses. He’s scowling in a way thatmakes me sure I’ve already disappointed him.“What?” I ask defensively.“You just remember who the enemy is,” Haymitch tells me. “That’s all. Now go on.Get out of here.”We walk down the hallway. Peeta wants to stop by his room to shower off themakeup and meet me in a few minutes, but I won’t let him. I’m certain that if adoor shuts between us, it will lock and I’ll have to spend the night withouthim. Besides, I have a shower in my room. I refuse to let go of his hand.Do we sleep? I don’t know. We spend the night holding each other, in somehalfway land between dreams and waking. Not talking. Both afraid to disturb theother in the hope that we’ll be able to store up a few precious minutes of rest.Cinna and Portia arrive with the dawn, and I know Peeta will have to go.Tributes enter the arena alone. He gives me a light kiss. “See you soon,” hesays.“See you soon,” I answer.Cinna, who will help dress me for the Games, accompanies me to the roof. I’mabout to mount the ladder to the hovercraft when I remember. “I didn’t saygood-bye to Portia.”“I’ll tell her,” says Cinna.The electric current freezes me in place on the ladder until the doctor injectsthe tracker into my left forearm. Now they will always be able to locate me inthe arena. The hovercraft takes off, and I look out the windows until they blackout. Cinna keeps pressing me to eat and, when that fails, to drink. I manage tokeep sipping water, thinking of the days of dehydration that almost killed melast year. Thinking of how I will need my strength to keep Peeta alive.When we reach the Launch Room at the arena, I shower. Cinna braids my hair downmy back and helps me dress over simple undergarments. This year’s tribute outfitis a fitted blue jumpsuit, made of very sheer material, that zippers up thefront. A six-inch-wide padded belt covered in shiny purple plastic. A pair ofnylon shoes with rubber soles.“What do you think?” I ask, holding the fabric out for Cinna to examine.He frowns as he rubs the thin stuff between his fingers. “I don’t know. It willoffer little in the way of protection from cold or water.”“Sun?” I ask, picturing a burning sun over a barren desert.“Possibly. If it’s been treated,” he says. “Oh, I almost forgot this.” He takesmy gold mockingjay pin from his pocket and fixes it to the jumpsuit.“My dress was fantastic last night,” I say. Fantastic and reckless. But Cinnamust know that.“I thought you might like it,” he says with a tight smile.We sit, as we did last year, holding hands until the voice tells me to preparefor the launch. He walks me over to the circular metal plate and zips up theneck of my jumpsuit securely. “Remember, girl on fire,” he says, “I’m stillbetting on you.” He kisses my forehead and steps back as the glass cylinderslides down around me.“Thank you,” I say, although he probably can’t hear me. I lift my chin, holdingmy head high the way he always tells me to, and wait for the plate to rise. Butit doesn’t. And it still doesn’t.I look at Cinna, raising my eyebrows for an explanation. He just gives his heada slight shake, as perplexed as I am. Why are they delaying this?Suddenly the door behind him bursts open and three Peacekeepers spring into theroom. Two pin Cinna’s arms behind him and cuff him while the third hits him inthe temple with such force he’s knocked to his knees. But they keep hitting himwith metal-studded gloves, opening gashes on his face and body. I’m screaming myhead off, banging on the unyielding glass, trying to reach him. The Peacekeepersignore me completely as they drag Cinna’s limp body from the room. All that’sleft are the smears of blood on the floor.Sickened and terrified, I feel the plate begin to rise. I’m still leaningagainst the glass when the breeze catches my hair and I force myself tostraighten up. Just in time, too, because the glass is retreating and I’mstanding free in the arena. Something seems to be wrong with my vision. Theground is too bright and shiny and keeps undulating. I squint down at my feetand see that my metal plate is surrounded by blue waves that lap up over myboots. Slowly I raise my eyes and take in the water spreading out in everydirection.I can only form one clear thought.This is no place for a girl on fire."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00026.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00029.jpg]“Ladies and gentlemen, let the Seventy-fifth Hunger Games begin!” The voice ofClaudius Templesmith, the Hunger Games announcer, hammers my ears. I have lessthan a minute to get my bearings. Then the gong will sound and the tributes willbe free to move off their metal plates. But move where?I can’t think straight. The image of Cinna, beaten and bloody, consumes me.Where is he now? What are they doing to him? Torturing him? Killing him? Turninghim into an Avox? Obviously his assault was staged to unhinge me, the same wayDarius’s presence in my quarters was. And it has unhinged me. All I want to dois collapse on my metal plate. But I can hardly do that after what I justwitnessed. I must be strong. I owe it to Cinna, who risked everything byundermining President Snow and turning my bridal silk into mockingjay plumage.And I owe it to the rebels who, emboldened by Cinna’s example, might be fightingto bring down the Capitol at this moment. My refusal to play the Games on theCapitol’s terms is to be my last act of rebellion. So I grit my teeth and willmyself to be a player.Where are you? I can still make no sense of my surroundings. Where are you?! Idemand an answer from myself and slowly the world comes into focus. Blue water.Pink sky. White-hot sun beating down. All right, there’s the Cornucopia, theshining gold metal horn, about forty yards away. At first, it appears to besitting on a circular island. But on closer examination, I see the thin stripsof land radiating from the circle like the spokes on a wheel. I think there areten to twelve, and they seem equidistant from one another. Between the spokes,all is water. Water and a pair of tributes.That’s it, then. There are twelve spokes, each with two tributes balanced onmetal plates between them. The other tribute in my watery wedge is old Woof fromDistrict 8. He’s about as far to my right as the land strip on my left. Beyondthe water, wherever you look, a narrow beach and then dense greenery. I scan thecircle of tributes, looking for Peeta, but he must be blocked from my view bythe Cornucopia.I catch a handful of water as it washes in and smell it. Then I touch the tip ofmy wet finger to my tongue. As I suspected, it’s saltwater. Just like the wavesPeeta and I encountered on our brief tour of the beach in District 4. But atleast it seems clean.There are no boats, no ropes, not even a bit of driftwood to cling to. No,there’s only one way to get to the Cornucopia. When the gong sounds, I don’teven hesitate before I dive to my left. It’s a longer distance than I’m used to,and navigating the waves takes a little more skill than swimming across my quietlake at home, but my body seems oddly light and I cut through the watereffortlessly. Maybe it’s the salt. I pull myself, dripping, onto the land stripand sprint down the sandy stretch for the Cornucopia. I can see no one elseconverging from my side, although the gold horn blocks a good portion of myview. I don’t let the thought of adversaries slow me down, though. I’m thinkinglike a Career now, and the first thing I want is to get my hands on a weapon.Last year, the supplies were spread out quite a distance around the Cornucopia,with the most valuable closest to the horn. But this year, the booty seems to bepiled at the twenty-foot-high mouth. My eyes instantly home in on a golden bowjust in arm’s reach and I yank it free.There’s someone behind me. I’m alerted by, I don’t know, a soft shift of sand ormaybe just a change in the air currents. I pull an arrow from the sheath that’sstill wedged in the pile and arm my bow as I turn.Finnick, glistening and gorgeous, stands a few yards away, with a trident poisedto attack. A net dangles from his other hand. He’s smiling a little, but themuscles in his upper body are rigid in anticipation. “You can swim, too,” hesays. “Where did you learn that in District Twelve?”“We have a big bathtub,” I answer.“You must,” he says. “You like the arena?”“Not particularly. But you should. They must have built it especially for you,”I say with an edge of bitterness. It seems like it, anyway, with all the water,when I bet only a handful of the victors can swim. And there was no pool in theTraining Center, no chance to learn. Either you came in here a swimmer or you’dbetter be a really fast learner. Even participation in the initial bloodbathdepends on being able to cover twenty yards of water. That gives District 4 anenormous advantage.For a moment we’re frozen, sizing each other up, our weapons, our skill. ThenFinnick suddenly grins. “Lucky thing we’re allies. Right?”Sensing a trap, I’m about to let my arrow fly, hoping it finds his heart beforethe trident impales me, when he shifts his hand and something on his wristcatches the sunlight. A solid-gold bangle patterned with flames. The same one Iremember on Haymitch’s wrist the morning I began training. I briefly considerthat Finnick could have stolen it to trick me, but somehow I know this isn’t thecase. Haymitch gave it to him. As a signal to me. An order, really. To trustFinnick.I can hear other footsteps approaching. I must decide at once. “Right!” I snap,because even though Haymitch is my mentor and trying to keep me alive, thisangers me. Why didn’t he tell me he’d made this arrangement before? Probablybecause Peeta and I had ruled out allies. Now Haymitch has chosen one on hisown.“Duck!” Finnick commands in such a powerful voice, so different from his usualseductive purr, that I do. His trident goes whizzing over my head and there’s asickening sound of impact as it finds its target. The man from District 5, thedrunk who threw up on the sword-fighting floor, sinks to his knees as Finnickfrees the trident from his chest. “Don’t trust One and Two,” Finnick says.There’s no time to question this. I work the sheath of arrows free. “Each takeone side?” I say. He nods, and I dart around the pile. About four spokes apart,Enobaria and Gloss are just reaching land. Either they’re slow swimmers or theythought the water might be laced with other dangers, which it might well be.Sometimes it’s not good to consider too many scenarios. But now that they’re onthe sand, they’ll be here in a matter of seconds.“Anything useful?” I hear Finnick shout.I quickly scan the pile on my side and find maces, swords, bows and arrows,tridents, knives, spears, axes, metallic objects I have no name for . . . andnothing else.“Weapons!” I call back. “Nothing but weapons!”“Same here,” he confirms. “Grab what you want and let’s go!”I shoot an arrow at Enobaria, who’s gotten in too close for comfort, but she’sexpecting it and dives back into the water before it can find its mark. Glossisn’t quite as swift, and I sink an arrow into his calf as he plunges into thewaves. I sling an extra bow and a second sheath of arrows over my body, slidetwo long knives and an awl into my belt, and meet up with Finnick at the frontof the pile.“Do something about that, would you?” he says. I see Brutus barreling toward us.His belt is undone and he has it stretched between his hands as a kind ofshield. I shoot at him and he manages to block the arrow with his belt before itcan skewer his liver. Where it punctures the belt, a purple liquid spews forth,coating his face. As I reload, Brutus flattens on the ground, rolls the few feetto the water, and submerges. There’s a clang of metal falling behind me. “Let’sclear out,” I say to Finnick.This last altercation has given Enobaria and Gloss time to reach the Cornucopia.Brutus is within shooting distance and somewhere, certainly, Cashmere is nearby,too. These four classic Careers will no doubt have a prior alliance. If I hadonly my own safety to consider, I might be willing to take them on with Finnickby my side. But it’s Peeta I’m thinking about. I spot him now, still stranded onhis metal plate. I take off and Finnick follows without question, as if knowingthis will be my next move. When I’m as close as I can get, I start removingknives from my belt, preparing to swim out to reach him and somehow bring himin.Finnick drops a hand on my shoulder. “I’ll get him.”Suspicion flickers up inside me. Could this all just be a ruse? For Finnick towin my trust and then swim out and drown Peeta? “I can,” I insist.But Finnick has dropped all his weapons to the ground. “Better not exertyourself. Not in your condition,” he says, and reaches down and pats my abdomen.Oh, right. I’m supposed to be pregnant, I think. While I’m trying to think whatthat means and how I should act — maybe throw up or something — Finnick haspositioned himself at the edge of the water.“Cover me,” he says. He disappears with a flawless dive.I raise my bow, warding off any attackers from the Cornucopia, but no one seemsinterested in pursuing us. Sure enough, Gloss, Cashmere, Enobaria, and Brutushave gathered, their pack formed already, picking over the weapons. A quicksurvey of the rest of the arena shows that most of the tributes are stilltrapped on their plates. Wait, no, there’s someone standing on the spoke to myleft, the one opposite Peeta. It’s Mags. But she neither heads for theCornucopia nor tries to flee. Instead she splashes into the water and startspaddling toward me, her gray head bobbing above the waves. Well, she’s old, butI guess after eighty years of living in District 4 she can keep afloat.Finnick has reached Peeta now and is towing him back, one arm across his chestwhile the other propels them through the water with easy strokes. Peeta ridesalong without resisting. I don’t know what Finnick said or did that convincedhim to put his life in his hands — showed him the bangle, maybe. Or just thesight of me waiting might have been enough. When they reach the sand, I helphaul Peeta up onto dry land.“Hello, again,” he says, and gives me a kiss. “We’ve got allies.”“Yes. Just as Haymitch intended,” I answer.“Remind me, did we make deals with anyone else?” Peeta asks.“Only Mags, I think,” I say. I nod toward the old woman doggedly making her waytoward us.“Well, I can’t leave Mags behind,” says Finnick. “She’s one of the few peoplewho actually likes me.”“I’ve got no problem with Mags,” I say. “Especially now that I see the arena.Her fishhooks are probably our best chance of getting a meal.”“Katniss wanted her on the first day,” says Peeta.“Katniss has remarkably good judgment,” says Finnick. With one hand he reachesinto the water and scoops out Mags like she weighs no more than a puppy. Shemakes some remark that I think includes the word “bob,” then pats her belt.“Look, she’s right. Someone figured it out.” Finnick points to Beetee. He’sflailing around in the waves but managing to keep his head above water.“What?” I say.“The belts. They’re flotation devices,” says Finnick. “I mean, you have topropel yourself, but they’ll keep you from drowning.”I almost ask Finnick to wait, to get Beetee and Wiress and take them with us,but Beetee’s three spokes over and I can’t even see Wiress. For all I know,Finnick would kill them as quickly as he did the tribute from 5, so instead Isuggest we move on. I hand Peeta a bow, a sheath of arrows, and a knife, keepingthe rest for myself. But Mags tugs on my sleeve and babbles on until I’ve giventhe awl to her. Pleased, she clamps the handle between her gums and reaches herarms up to Finnick. He tosses his net over his shoulder, hoists Mags on top ofit, grips his tridents in his free hand, and we run away from the Cornucopia.Where the sand ends, woods begin to rise sharply. No, not really woods. At leastnot the kind I know. Jungle. The foreign, almost obsolete word comes to mind.Something I heard from another Hunger Games or learned from my father. Most ofthe trees are unfamiliar, with smooth trunks and few branches. The earth is veryblack and spongy underfoot, often obscured by tangles of vines with colorfulblossoms. While the sun’s hot and bright, the air’s warm and heavy withmoisture, and I get the feeling I will never really be dry here. The thin bluefabric of my jumpsuit lets the seawater evaporate easily, but it’s already begunto cling to me with sweat.Peeta takes the lead, cutting through the patches of dense vegetation with hislong knife. I make Finnick go second because even though he’s the most powerful,he’s got his hands full with Mags. Besides, while he’s a whiz with that trident,it’s a weapon less suited to the jungle than my arrows. It doesn’t take long,between the steep incline and the heat, to become short of breath. Peeta and Ihave been training intensely, though, and Finnick’s such an amazing physicalspecimen that even with Mags over his shoulder, we climb rapidly for about amile before he requests a rest. And then I think it’s more for Mags’s sake thanhis own.The foliage has hidden the wheel from sight, so I scale a tree with rubberylimbs to get a better view. And then wish that I hadn’t.Around the Cornucopia, the ground appears to be bleeding; the water has purplestains. Bodies lie on the ground and float in the sea, but at this distance,with everyone dressed exactly the same, I can’t tell who lives or dies. All Ican tell is that some of the tiny blue figures still battle. Well, what did Ithink? That the victors’ chain of locked hands last night would result in somesort of universal truce in the arena? No, I never believed that. But I guess Ihad hoped people might show some . . . what? Restraint? Reluctance, at least.Before they jumped right into massacre mode. And you all knew each other, Ithink. You acted like friends.I have only one real friend in here. And he isn’t from District 4.I let the slight, soupy breeze cool my cheeks while I come to a decision.Despite the bangle, I should just get it over with and shoot Finnick. There’sreally no future in this alliance. And he’s too dangerous to let go. Now, whenwe have this tentative trust, may be my only chance to kill him. I could easilyshoot him in the back as we walk. It’s despicable, of course, but will it be anymore despicable if I wait? Know him better? Owe him more? No, this is the time.I take one last look at the battling figures, the bloody ground, to harden myresolve, and then slide to the ground.But when I land, I find Finnick’s kept pace with my thoughts. As if he knowswhat I have seen and how it will have affected me. He has one of his tridentsraised in a casually defensive position.“What’s going on down there, Katniss? Have they all joined hands? Taken a vow ofnonviolence? Tossed the weapons in the sea in defiance of the Capitol?” Finnickasks.“No,” I say.“No,” Finnick repeats. “Because whatever happened in the past is in the past.And no one in this arena was a victor by chance.” He eyes Peeta for a moment.“Except maybe Peeta.”Finnick knows then what Haymitch and I know. About Peeta. Being truly, deep-downbetter than the rest of us. Finnick took out that tribute from 5 withoutblinking an eye. And how long did I take to turn deadly? I shot to kill when Itargeted Enobaria and Gloss and Brutus. Peeta would at least have attemptednegotiations first. Seen if some wider alliance was possible. But to what end?Finnick’s right. I’m right. The people in this arena weren’t crowned for theircompassion.I hold his gaze, weighing his speed against my own. The time it will take tosend an arrow through his brain versus the time his trident will reach my body.I can see him, waiting for me to make the first move. Calculating if he shouldblock first or go directly for an attack. I can feel we’ve both about worked itout when Peeta steps deliberately between us.“So how many are dead?” he asks.Move, you idiot, I think. But he remains planted firmly between us.“Hard to say,” I answer. “At least six, I think. And they’re still fighting.”“Let’s keep moving. We need water,” he says.So far there’s been no sign of a freshwater stream or pond, and the saltwater’sundrinkable. Again, I think of the last Games, where I nearly died ofdehydration.“Better find some soon,” says Finnick. “We need to be undercover when the otherscome hunting us tonight.”We. Us. Hunting. All right, maybe killing Finnick would be a little premature.He’s been helpful so far. He does have Haymitch’s stamp of approval. And whoknows what the night will hold? If worse comes to worst, I can always kill himin his sleep. So I let the moment pass. And so does Finnick.The absence of water intensifies my thirst. I keep a sharp eye out as wecontinue our trek upward, but with no luck. After about another mile, I can seean end to the tree line and assume we’re reaching the crest of the hill. “Maybewe’ll have better luck on the other side. Find a spring or something.”But there is no other side. I know this before anyone else, even though I amfarthest from the top. My eyes catch on a funny, rippling square hanging like awarped pane of glass in the air. At first I think it’s the glare from the sun orthe heat shimmering up off the ground. But it’s fixed in space, not shiftingwhen I move. And that’s when I connect the square with Wiress and Beetee in theTraining Center and realize what lies before us. My warning cry is just reachingmy lips when Peeta’s knife swings out to slash away some vines.There’s a sharp zapping sound. For an instant, the trees are gone and I see openspace over a short stretch of bare earth. Then Peeta’s flung back from the forcefield, bringing Finnick and Mags to the ground.I rush over to where he lies, motionless in a web of vines. “Peeta?” There’s afaint smell of singed hair. I call his name again, giving him a little shake,but he’s unresponsive. My fingers fumble across his lips, where there’s no warmbreath although moments ago he was panting. I press my ear against his chest, tothe spot where I always rest my head, where I know I will hear the strong andsteady beat of his heart.Instead, I find silence."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00033.jpg]“Peeta!” I scream. I shake him harder, even resort to slapping his face, butit’s no use. His heart has failed. I am slapping emptiness. “Peeta!”Finnick props Mags against a tree and pushes me out of the way. “Let me.” Hisfingers touch points at Peeta’s neck, run over the bones in his ribs and spine.Then he pinches Peeta’s nostrils shut.“No!” I yell, hurling myself at Finnick, for surely he intends to make certainthat Peeta’s dead, to keep any hope of life from returning to him. Finnick’shand comes up and hits me so hard, so squarely in the chest that I go flyingback into a nearby tree trunk. I’m stunned for a moment, by the pain, by tryingto regain my wind, as I see Finnick close off Peeta’s nose again. From where Isit, I pull an arrow, whip the notch into place, and am about to let it fly whenI’m stopped by the sight of Finnick kissing Peeta. And it’s so bizarre, even forFinnick, that I stay my hand. No, he’s not kissing him. He’s got Peeta’s noseblocked off but his mouth tilted open, and he’s blowing air into his lungs. Ican see this, I can actually see Peeta’s chest rising and falling. Then Finnickunzips the top of Peeta’s jumpsuit and begins to pump the spot over his heartwith the heels of his hands. Now that I’ve gotten through my shock, I understandwhat he’s trying to do.Once in a blue moon, I’ve seen my mother try something similar, but not often.If your heart fails in District 12, it’s unlikely your family could get you tomy mother in time, anyway. So her usual patients are burned or wounded or ill.Or starving, of course.But Finnick’s world is different. Whatever he’s doing, he’s done it before.There’s a very set rhythm and method. And I find the arrow tip sinking to theground as I lean in to watch, desperately, for some sign of success. Agonizingminutes drag past as my hopes diminish. Around the time that I’m deciding it’stoo late, that Peeta’s dead, moved on, unreachable forever, he gives a smallcough and Finnick sits back.I leave my weapons in the dirt as I fling myself at him. “Peeta?” I say softly.I brush the damp blond strands of hair back from his forehead, find the pulsedrumming against my fingers at his neck.His lashes flutter open and his eyes meet mine. “Careful,” he says weakly.“There’s a force field up ahead.”I laugh, but there are tears running down my cheeks.“Must be a lot stronger than the one on the Training Center roof,” he says. “I’mall right, though. Just a little shaken.”“You were dead! Your heart stopped!” I burst out, before really considering ifthis is a good idea. I clap my hand over my mouth because I’m starting to makethose awful choking sounds that happen when I sob.“Well, it seems to be working now,” he says. “It’s all right, Katniss.” I nod myhead but the sounds aren’t stopping. “Katniss?” Now Peeta’s worried about me,which adds to the insanity of it all.“It’s okay. It’s just her hormones,” says Finnick. “From the baby.” I look upand see him, sitting back on his knees but still panting a bit from the climband the heat and the effort of bringing Peeta back from the dead.“No. It’s not —” I get out, but I’m cut off by an even more hysterical round ofsobbing that seems only to confirm what Finnick said about the baby. He meets myeyes and I glare at him through my tears. It’s stupid, I know, that his effortsmake me so vexed. All I wanted was to keep Peeta alive, and I couldn’t andFinnick could, and I should be nothing but grateful. And I am. But I am alsofurious because it means that I will never stop owing Finnick Odair. Ever. Sohow can I kill him in his sleep?I expect to see a smug or sarcastic expression on his face, but his look isstrangely quizzical. He glances between Peeta and me, as if trying to figuresomething out, then gives his head a slight shake as if to clear it. “How areyou?” he asks Peeta. “Do you think you can move on?”“No, he has to rest,” I say. My nose is running like crazy and I don’t even havea shred of fabric to use as a handkerchief. Mags rips off a handful of hangingmoss from a tree limb and gives it to me. I’m too much of a mess to evenquestion it. I blow my nose loudly and mop the tears off my face. It’s nice, themoss. Absorbent and surprisingly soft.I notice a gleam of gold on Peeta’s chest. I reach out and retrieve the diskthat hangs from a chain around his neck. My mockingjay has been engraved on it.“Is this your token?” I ask.“Yes. Do you mind that I used your mockingjay? I wanted us to match,” he says.“No, of course I don’t mind.” I force a smile. Peeta showing up in the arenawearing a mockingjay is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it shouldgive a boost to the rebels in the district. On the other, it’s hard to imaginePresident Snow will overlook it, and that makes the job of keeping Peeta aliveharder.“So you want to make camp here, then?” Finnick asks.“I don’t think that’s an option,” Peeta answers. “Staying here. With no water.No protection. I feel all right, really. If we could just go slowly.”“Slowly would be better than not at all.” Finnick helps Peeta to his feet whileI pull myself together. Since I got up this morning I’ve watched Cinna beaten toa pulp, landed in another arena, and seen Peeta die. Still, I’m glad Finnickkeeps playing the pregnancy card for me, because from a sponsor’s point of view,I’m not handling things all that well.I check over my weapons, which I know are in perfect condition, because it makesme seem more in control. “I’ll take the lead,” I announce.Peeta starts to object but Finnick cuts him off. “No, let her do it.” He frownsat me. “You knew that force field was there, didn’t you? Right at the lastsecond? You started to give a warning.” I nod. “How did you know?”I hesitate. To reveal that I know Beetee and Wiress’s trick of recognizing aforce field could be dangerous. I don’t know if the Gamemakers made note of thatmoment during training when the two pointed it out to me or not. One way or theother, I have a very valuable piece of information. And if they know I have it,they might do something to alter the force field so I can’t see the aberrationanymore. So I lie. “I don’t know. It’s almost as if I could hear it. Listen.” Weall become still. There’s the sound of insects, birds, the breeze in thefoliage.“I don’t hear anything,” says Peeta.“Yes,” I insist, “it’s like when the fence around District Twelve is on, onlymuch, much quieter.” Everyone listens again intently. I do, too, althoughthere’s nothing to hear. “There!” I say. “Can’t you hear it? It’s coming fromright where Peeta got shocked.”“I don’t hear it, either,” says Finnick. “But if you do, by all means, take thelead.”I decide to play this for all it’s worth. “That’s weird,” I say. I turn my headfrom side to side as if puzzled. “I can only hear it out of my left ear.”“The one the doctors reconstructed?” asks Peeta.“Yeah,” I say, then give a shrug. “Maybe they did a better job than theythought. You know, sometimes I do hear funny things on that side. Things youwouldn’t ordinarily think have a sound. Like insect wings. Or snow hitting theground.” Perfect. Now all the attention will turn to the surgeons who fixed mydeaf ear after the Games last year, and they’ll have to explain why I can hearlike a bat.“You,” says Mags, nudging me forward, so I take the lead. Since we’re to bemoving slowly, Mags prefers to walk with the aid of a branch Finnick quicklyfashions into a cane for her. He makes a staff for Peeta as well, which is goodbecause, despite his protestations, I think all Peeta really wants to do is liedown. Finnick brings up the rear, so at least someone alert has our backs.I walk with the force field on my left, because that’s supposed to be the sidewith my superhuman ear. But since that’s all made up, I cut down a bunch of hardnuts that hang like grapes from a nearby tree and toss them ahead of me as I go.It’s good I do, too, because I have a feeling I’m missing the patches thatindicate the force field more often than I’m spotting them. Whenever a nut hitsthe force field, there’s a puff of smoke before the nut lands, blackened andwith a cracked shell, on the ground at my feet.After a few minutes I become aware of a smacking sound behind me and turn to seeMags peeling the shell off one of the nuts and popping it in her already-fullmouth. “Mags!” I cry. “Spit that out. It could be poisonous.”She mumbles something and ignores me, licking her lips with apparent relish. Ilook to Finnick for help but he just laughs. “I guess we’ll find out,” he says.I go forward, wondering about Finnick, who saved old Mags but will let her eatstrange nuts. Who Haymitch has stamped with his seal of approval. Who broughtPeeta back from the dead. Why didn’t he just let him die? He would have beenblameless. I never would have guessed it was in his power to revive him. Whycould he possibly have wanted to save Peeta? And why was he so determined toteam up with me? Willing to kill me, too, if it comes to that. But leaving thechoice of if we fight to me.I keep walking, tossing my nuts, sometimes catching a glimpse of the forcefield, trying to press to the left to find a spot where we can break through,get away from the Cornucopia, and hopefully find water. But after another houror so of this I realize it’s futile. We’re not making any progress to the left.In fact, the force field seems to be herding us along a curved path. I stop andlook back at Mags’s limping form, the sheen of sweat on Peeta’s face. “Let’stake a break,” I say. “I need to get another look from above.”The tree I choose seems to jut higher into the air than the others. I make myway up the twisting boughs, staying as close to the trunk as possible. Notelling how easily these rubbery branches will snap. Still I climb beyond goodsense because there’s something I have to see. As I cling to a stretch of trunkno wider than a sapling, swaying back and forth in the humid breeze, mysuspicions are confirmed. There’s a reason we can’t turn to the left, will neverbe able to. From this precarious vantage point, I can see the shape of the wholearena for the first time. A perfect circle. With a perfect wheel in the middle.The sky above the circumference of the jungle is tinged a uniform pink. And Ithink I can make out one or two of those wavy squares, chinks in the armor,Wiress and Beetee called them, because they reveal what was meant to be hiddenand are therefore a weakness. Just to make absolutely sure, I shoot an arrowinto the empty space above the tree line. There’s a spurt of light, a flash ofreal blue sky, and the arrow’s thrown back into the jungle. I climb down to givethe others the bad news.“The force field has us trapped in a circle. A dome, really. I don’t know howhigh it goes. There’s the Cornucopia, the sea, and then the jungle all around.Very exact. Very symmetrical. And not very large,” I say.“Did you see any water?” asks Finnick.“Only the saltwater where we started the Games,” I say.“There must be some other source,” says Peeta, frowning. “Or we’ll all be deadin a matter of days.”“Well, the foliage is thick. Maybe there are ponds or springs somewhere,” I saydoubtfully. I instinctively feel the Capitol might want these unpopular Gamesover as soon as possible. Plutarch Heavensbee might have already been givenorders to knock us off. “At any rate, there’s no point in trying to find outwhat’s over the edge of this hill, because the answer is nothing.”“There must be drinkable water between the force field and the wheel,” Peetainsists. We all know what this means. Heading back down. Heading back to theCareers and the bloodshed. With Mags hardly able to walk and Peeta too weak tofight.We decide to move down the slope a few hundred yards and continue circling. Seeif maybe there’s some water at that level. I stay in the lead, occasionallychucking a nut to my left, but we’re well out of range of the force field now.The sun beats down on us, turning the air to steam, playing tricks on our eyes.By midafternoon, it’s clear Peeta and Mags can’t go on.Finnick chooses a campsite about ten yards below the force field, saying we canuse it as a weapon by deflecting our enemies into it if attacked. Then he andMags pull blades of the sharp grass that grows in five-foot-high tufts and beginto weave them together into mats. Since Mags seems to have no ill effects fromthe nuts, Peeta collects bunches of them and fries them by bouncing them off theforce field. He methodically peels off the shells, piling the meats on a leaf. Istand guard, fidgety and hot and raw with the emotions of the day.Thirsty. I am so thirsty. Finally I can’t stand it anymore. “Finnick, why don’tyou stand guard and I’ll hunt around some more for water,” I say. No one’sthrilled with the idea of me going off alone, but the threat of dehydrationhangs over us.“Don’t worry, I won’t go far,” I promise Peeta.“I’ll go, too,” he says.“No, I’m going to do some hunting if I can,” I tell him. I don’t add, “And youcan’t come because you’re too loud.” But it’s implied. He would both scare offprey and endanger me with his heavy tread. “I won’t be long.”I move stealthily through the trees, happy to find that the ground lends itselfto soundless footsteps. I work my way down at a diagonal, but I find nothingexcept more lush, green plant life.The sound of the cannon brings me to a halt. The initial bloodbath at theCornucopia must be over. The death toll of the tributes is now available. Icount the shots, each representing one dead victor. Eight. Not as many as lastyear. But it seems like more since I know most of their names.Suddenly weak, I lean against a tree to rest, feeling the heat draw the moisturefrom my body like a sponge. Already, swallowing is difficult and fatigue iscreeping up on me. I try rubbing my hand across my belly, hoping somesympathetic pregnant woman will become my sponsor and Haymitch can send in somewater. No luck. I sink to the ground.In my stillness, I begin to notice the animals: strange birds with brilliantplumage, tree lizards with flickering blue tongues, and something that lookslike a cross between a rat and a possum clinging on the branches close to thetrunk. I shoot one of the latter out of a tree to get a closer look.It’s ugly, all right, a big rodent with a fuzz of mottled gray fur and twowicked-looking gnawing teeth protruding over its lower lip. As I’m gutting andskinning it, I notice something else. Its muzzle is wet. Like an animal that’sbeen drinking from a stream. Excited, I start at its home tree and move slowlyout in a spiral. It can’t be far, the creature’s water source.Nothing. I find nothing. Not so much as a dewdrop. Eventually, because I knowPeeta will be worried about me, I head back to the camp, hotter and morefrustrated than ever.When I arrive, I see the others have transformed the place. Mags and Finnickhave created a hut of sorts out of the grass mats, open on one side but withthree walls, a floor, and a roof. Mags has also plaited several bowls that Peetahas filled with roasted nuts. Their faces turn to me hopefully, but I give myhead a shake. “No. No water. It’s out there, though. He knew where it was,” Isay, hoisting the skinned rodent up for all to see. “He’d been drinking recentlywhen I shot him out of a tree, but I couldn’t find his source. I swear, Icovered every inch of ground in a thirty-yard radius.”“Can we eat him?” Peeta asks.“I don’t know for sure. But his meat doesn’t look that different from asquirrel’s. He ought to be cooked. . . .” I hesitate as I think of trying tostart a fire out here from complete scratch. Even if I succeed, there’s thesmoke to think about. We’re all so close together in this arena, there’s nochance of hiding it.Peeta has another idea. He takes a cube of rodent meat, skewers it on the tip ofa pointed stick, and lets it fall into the force field. There’s a sharp sizzleand the stick flies back. The chunk of meat is blackened on the outside but wellcooked inside. We give him a round of applause, then quickly stop, rememberingwhere we are.The white sun sinks in the rosy sky as we gather in the hut. I’m still leeryabout the nuts, but Finnick says Mags recognized them from another Games. Ididn’t bother spending time at the edible-plants station in training because itwas so effortless for me last year. Now I wish I had. For surely there wouldhave been some of the unfamiliar plants surrounding me. And I might have guesseda bit more about where I was headed. Mags seems fine, though, and she’s beeneating the nuts for hours. So I pick one up and take a small bite. It has amild, slightly sweet flavor that reminds me of a chestnut. I decide it’s allright. The rodent’s strong and gamey but surprisingly juicy. Really, it’s not abad meal for our first night in the arena. If only we had something to wash itdown with.Finnick asks a lot of questions about the rodent, which we decide to call a treerat. How high was it, how long did I watch it before I shot, and what was itdoing? I don’t remember it doing much of anything. Snuffling around for insectsor something.I’m dreading the night. At least the tightly woven grass offers some protectionfrom whatever slinks across the jungle floor after hours. But a short timebefore the sun slips below the horizon, a pale white moon rises, making thingsjust visible enough. Our conversation trails off because we know what’s coming.We position ourselves in a line at the mouth of the hut and Peeta slips his handinto mine.The sky brightens when the seal of the Capitol appears as if floating in space.As I listen to the strains of the anthem I think, It will be harder for Finnickand Mags. But it turns out to be plenty hard for me as well. Seeing the faces ofthe eight dead victors projected into the sky.The man from District 5, the one Finnick took out with his trident, is the firstto appear. That means that all the tributes in 1 through 4 are alive — the fourCareers, Beetee and Wiress, and, of course, Mags and Finnick. The man fromDistrict 5 is followed by the male morphling from 6, Cecelia and Woof from 8,both from 9, the woman from 10, and Seeder from 11. The Capitol seal is backwith a final bit of music and then the sky goes dark except for the moon.No one speaks. I can’t pretend I knew any of them well. But I’m thinking ofthose three kids hanging on to Cecelia when they took her away. Seeder’skindness to me at our meeting. Even the thought of the glazed-eyed morphlingpainting my cheeks with yellow flowers gives me a pang. All dead. All gone.I don’t know how long we might have sat here if it weren’t for the arrival ofthe silver parachute, which glides down through the foliage to land before us.No one reaches for it.“Whose is it, do you think?” I say finally.“No telling,” says Finnick. “Why don’t we let Peeta claim it, since he diedtoday?”Peeta unties the cord and flattens out the circle of silk. On the parachute sitsa small metal object that I can’t place. “What is it?” I ask. No one knows. Wepass it from hand to hand, taking turns examining it. It’s a hollow metal tube,tapered slightly at one end. On the other end a small lip curves downward. It’svaguely familiar. A part that could have fallen off a bicycle, a curtain rod,anything, really.Peeta blows on one end to see if it makes a sound. It doesn’t. Finnick slideshis pinkie into it, testing it out as a weapon. Useless.“Can you fish with it, Mags?” I ask. Mags, who can fish with almost anything,shakes her head and grunts.I take it and roll it back and forth on my palm. Since we’re allies, Haymitchwill be working with the District 4 mentors. He had a hand in choosing thisgift. That means it’s valuable. Lifesaving, even. I think back to last year,when I wanted water so badly, but he wouldn’t send it because he knew I couldfind it if I tried. Haymitch’s gifts, or lack thereof, carry weighty messages. Ican almost hear him growling at me, Use your brain if you have one. What is it?I wipe the sweat from my eyes and hold the gift out in the moonlight. I move itthis way and that, viewing it from different angles, covering portions and thenrevealing them. Trying to make it divulge its purpose to me. Finally, infrustration, I jam one end into the dirt. “I give up. Maybe if we hook up withBeetee or Wiress they can figure it out.”I stretch out, pressing my hot cheek on the grass mat, staring at the thing inaggravation. Peeta rubs a tense spot between my shoulders and I let myself relaxa little. I wonder why this place hasn’t cooled off at all now that the sun’sgone down. I wonder what’s going on back home.Prim. My mother. Gale. Madge. I think of them watching me from home. At least Ihope they’re at home. Not taken into custody by Thread. Being punished as Cinnais. As Darius is. Punished because of me. Everybody.I begin to ache for them, for my district, for my woods. A decent woods withsturdy hardwood trees, plentiful food, game that isn’t creepy. Rushing streams.Cool breezes. No, cold winds to blow this stifling heat away. I conjure up sucha wind in my mind, letting it freeze my cheeks and numb my fingers, and all atonce, the piece of metal half buried in the black earth has a name.“A spile!” I exclaim, sitting bolt upright.“What?” asks Finnick.I wrestle the thing from the ground and brush it clean. Cup my hand around thetapered end, concealing it, and look at the lip. Yes, I’ve seen one of thesebefore. On a cold, windy day long ago, when I was out in the woods with myfather. Inserted snugly into a hole drilled in the side of a maple. A pathwayfor the sap to follow as it flowed into our bucket. Maple syrup could make evenour dull bread a treat. After my father died, I didn’t know what happened to thehandful of spiles he had. Hidden out in the woods somewhere, probably. Never tobe found.“It’s a spile. Sort of like a faucet. You put it in a tree and sap comes out.” Ilook at the sinewy green trunks around me. “Well, the right sort of tree.”“Sap?” asks Finnick. They don’t have the right kind of trees by the sea, either.“To make syrup,” says Peeta. “But there must be something else inside thesetrees.”We’re all on our feet at once. Our thirst. The lack of springs. The tree rat’ssharp front teeth and wet muzzle. There can only be one thing worth havinginside these trees. Finnick goes to hammer the spile into the green bark of amassive tree with a rock, but I stop him. “Wait. You might damage it. We need todrill a hole first,” I say.There’s nothing to drill with, so Mags offers her awl and Peeta drives itstraight into the bark, burying the spike two inches deep. He and Finnick taketurns opening up the hole with the awl and the knives until it can hold thespile. I wedge it in carefully and we all stand back in anticipation. At firstnothing happens. Then a drop of water rolls down the lip and lands in Mags’spalm. She licks it off and holds out her hand for more.By wiggling and adjusting the spile, we get a thin stream running out. We taketurns holding our mouths under the tap, wetting our parched tongues. Mags bringsover a basket, and the grass is so tightly woven it holds water. We fill thebasket and pass it around, taking deep gulps and, later, luxuriously, splashingour faces clean. Like everything here, the water’s on the warm side, but this isno time to be picky.Without our thirst to distract us, we’re all aware of how exhausted we are andmake preparations for the night. Last year, I always tried to have my gear readyin case I had to make a speedy retreat in the night. This year, there’s nobackpack to prepare. Just my weapons, which won’t leave my grasp, anyway. Then Ithink of the spile and wrest it from the tree trunk. I strip a tough vine of itsleaves, thread it through the hollow center, and tie the spile securely to mybelt.Finnick offers to take the first watch and I let him, knowing it has to be oneof the two of us until Peeta’s rested up. I lie down beside Peeta on the floorof the hut, telling Finnick to wake me when he’s tired. Instead I find myselfjarred from sleep a few hours later by what seems to be the tolling of a bell.Bong! Bong! It’s not exactly like the one they ring in the Justice Building onNew Year’s but close enough for me to recognize it. Peeta and Mags sleep throughit, but Finnick has the same look of attentiveness I feel. The tolling stops.“I counted twelve,” he says.I nod. Twelve. What does that signify? One ring for each district? Maybe. Butwhy? “Mean anything, do you think?”“No idea,” he says.We wait for further instructions, maybe a message from Claudius Templesmith. Aninvitation to a feast. The only thing of note appears in the distance. Adazzling bolt of electricity strikes a towering tree and then a lightning stormbegins. I guess it’s an indication of rain, of a water source for those whodon’t have mentors as smart as Haymitch.“Go to sleep, Finnick. It’s my turn to watch, anyway,” I say.Finnick hesitates, but no one can stay awake forever. He settles down at themouth of the hut, one hand gripped around a trident, and drifts into a restlesssleep.I sit with my bow loaded, watching the jungle, which is ghostly pale and greenin the moonlight. After an hour or so, the lightning stops. I can hear the raincoming in, though, pattering on the leaves a few hundred yards away. I keepwaiting for it to reach us but it never does.The sound of the cannon startles me, although it makes little impression on mysleeping companions. There’s no point in awakening them for this. Another victordead. I don’t even allow myself to wonder who it is.The elusive rain shuts off suddenly, like the storm did last year in the arena.Moments after it stops, I see the fog sliding softly in from the direction ofthe recent downpour. Just a reaction. Cool rain on the steaming ground, I think.It continues to approach at a steady pace. Tendrils reach forward and then curllike fingers, as if they are pulling the rest behind them. As I watch, I feelthe hairs on my neck begin to rise. Something’s wrong with this fog. Theprogression of the front line is too uniform to be natural. And if it’s notnatural . . .A sickeningly sweet odor begins to invade my nostrils and I reach for theothers, shouting for them to wake up.In the few seconds it takes to rouse them, I begin to blister."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00002.jpg]Tiny, searing stabs. Wherever the droplets of mist touch my skin.“Run!” I scream at the others. “Run!”Finnick snaps awake instantly, rising to counter an enemy. But when he sees thewall of fog, he tosses a still-sleeping Mags onto his back and takes off. Peetais on his feet but not as alert. I grab his arm and begin to propel him throughthe jungle after Finnick.“What is it? What is it?” he says in bewilderment.“Some kind of fog. Poisonous gas. Hurry, Peeta!” I urge. I can tell that howevermuch he denied it during the day, the aftereffects of hitting the force fieldhave been significant. He’s slow, much slower than usual. And the tangle ofvines and undergrowth, which unbalance me occasionally, trip him at every step.I look back at the wall of fog extending in a straight line as far as I can seein either direction. A terrible impulse to flee, to abandon Peeta and savemyself, shoots through me. It would be so simple, to run full out, perhaps toeven climb a tree above the fog line, which seems to top out at about fortyfeet. I remember how I did just this when the muttations appeared in the lastGames. Took off and only thought of Peeta when I’d reached the Cornucopia. Butthis time, I trap my terror, push it down, and stay by his side. This time mysurvival isn’t the goal. Peeta’s is. I think of the eyes glued to the televisionscreens in the districts, seeing if I will run, as the Capitol wishes, or holdmy ground.I lock my fingers tightly into his and say, “Watch my feet. Just try to stepwhere I step.” It helps. We seem to move a little faster, but never enough toafford a rest, and the mist continues to lap at our heels. Droplets spring freeof the body of vapor. They burn, but not like fire. Less a sense of heat andmore of intense pain as the chemicals find our flesh, cling to it, and burrowdown through the layers of skin. Our jumpsuits are no help at all. We may aswell be dressed in tissue paper, for all the protection they give.Finnick, who bounded off initially, stops when he realizes we’re havingproblems. But this is not a thing you can fight, only evade. He shoutsencouragement, trying to move us along, and the sound of his voice acts as aguide, though little more.Peeta’s artificial leg catches in a knot of creepers and he sprawls forwardbefore I can catch him. As I help him up, I become aware of something scarierthan the blisters, more debilitating than the burns. The left side of his facehas sagged, as if every muscle in it has died. The lid droops, almost concealinghis eye. His mouth twists in an odd angle toward the ground. “Peeta —” I begin.And that’s when I feel the spasms run up my arm.Whatever chemical laces the fog does more than burn — it targets our nerves. Awhole new kind of fear shoots through me and I yank Peeta forward, which onlycauses him to stumble again. By the time I get him to his feet, both of my armsare twitching uncontrollably. The fog has moved in on us, the body of it lessthan a yard away. Something is wrong with Peeta’s legs; he’s trying to walk butthey move in a spastic, puppetlike fashion.I feel him lurch forward and realize Finnick has come back for us and is haulingPeeta along. I wedge my shoulder, which still seems under my control, underPeeta’s arm and do my best to keep up with Finnick’s rapid pace. We put aboutten yards between us and the fog when Finnick stops.“It’s no good. I’ll have to carry him. Can you take Mags?” he asks me.“Yes,” I say stoutly, although my heart sinks. It’s true that Mags can’t weighmore than about seventy pounds, but I’m not very big myself. Still, I’m sureI’ve carried heavier loads. If only my arms would stop jumping around. I squatdown and she positions herself over my shoulder, the way she rides on Finnick. Islowly straighten my legs and, with my knees locked, I can manage her. Finnickhas Peeta slung across his back now and we move forward, Finnick leading, mefollowing in the trail he breaks through the vines.On the fog comes, silent and steady and flat, except for the grasping tendrils.Although my instinct is to run directly away from it, I realize Finnick ismoving at a diagonal down the hill. He’s trying to keep a distance from the gaswhile steering us toward the water that surrounds the Cornucopia. Yes, water, Ithink as the acid droplets bore deeper into me. Now I’m so thankful I didn’tkill Finnick, because how would I have gotten Peeta out of here alive? Sothankful to have someone else on my side, even if it’s only temporarily.It’s not Mags’s fault when I begin falling. She’s doing everything she can to bean easy passenger, but the fact is, there is only so much weight I can handle.Especially now that my right leg seems to be going stiff. The first two times Icrash to the ground, I manage to make it back on my feet, but the third time, Icannot get my leg to cooperate. As I struggle to get up, it gives out and Magsrolls off onto the ground before me. I flail around, trying to use vines andtrunks to right myself.Finnick’s back by my side, Peeta hanging over him. “It’s no use,” I say. “Canyou take them both? Go on ahead, I’ll catch up.” A somewhat doubtful proposal,but I say it with as much surety as I can muster.I can see Finnick’s eyes, green in the moonlight. I can see them as clear asday. Almost like a cat’s, with a strange reflective quality. Maybe because theyare shiny with tears. “No,” he says. “I can’t carry them both. My arms aren’tworking.” It’s true. His arms jerk uncontrollably at his sides. His hands areempty. Of his three tridents, only one remains, and it’s in Peeta’s hands. “I’msorry, Mags. I can’t do it.”What happens next is so fast, so senseless, I can’t even move to stop it. Magshauls herself up, plants a kiss on Finnick’s lips, and then hobbles straightinto the fog. Immediately, her body is seized by wild contortions and she fallsto the ground in a horrible dance.I want to scream, but my throat is on fire. I take one futile step in herdirection when I hear the cannon blast, know her heart has stopped, that she isdead. “Finnick?” I call out hoarsely, but he has already turned from the scene,already continued his retreat from the fog. Dragging my useless leg behind me, Istagger after him, having no idea what else to do.Time and space lose meaning as the fog seems to invade my brain, muddling mythoughts, making everything unreal. Some deep-rooted animal desire for survivalkeeps me stumbling after Finnick and Peeta, continuing to move, although I’mprobably dead already. Parts of me are dead, or clearly dying. And Mags is dead.This is something I know, or maybe just think I know, because it makes no senseat all.Moonlight glinting on Finnick’s bronze hair, beads of searing pain peppering me,a leg turned to wood. I follow Finnick until he collapses on the ground, Peetastill on top of him. I seem to have no ability to stop my own forward motion andsimply propel myself onward until I trip over their prone bodies, just one moreon the heap. This is where and how and when we all die, I think. But the thoughtis abstract and far less alarming than the current agonies of my body. I hearFinnick groan and manage to drag myself off the others. Now I can see the wallof fog, which has taken on a pearly white quality. Maybe it’s my eyes playingtricks, or the moonlight, but the fog seems to be transforming. Yes, it’sbecoming thicker, as if it has pressed up against a glass window and is beingforced to condense. I squint harder and realize the fingers no longer protrudefrom it. In fact, it has stopped moving forward entirely. Like other horrors Ihave witnessed in the arena, it has reached the end of its territory. Eitherthat or the Gamemakers have decided not to kill us just yet.“It’s stopped,” I try to say, but only an awful croaking sound comes from myswollen mouth. “It’s stopped,” I say again, and this time I must be clearer,because both Peeta and Finnick turn their heads to the fog. It begins to riseupward now, as if being slowly vacuumed into the sky. We watch until it has allbeen sucked away and not the slightest wisp remains.Peeta rolls off Finnick, who turns over onto his back. We lie there gasping,twitching, our minds and bodies invaded by the poison. After a few minutes pass,Peeta vaguely gestures upward. “Mon-hees.” I look up and spot a pair of what Iguess are monkeys. I have never seen a live monkey — there’s nothing like thatin our woods at home. But I must have seen a picture, or one in the Games,because when I see the creatures, the same word comes to my mind. I think thesehave orange fur, although it’s hard to tell, and are about half the size of afull-grown human. I take the monkeys for a good sign. Surely they would not hangaround if the air was deadly. For a while, we quietly observe one another,humans and monkeys. Then Peeta struggles to his knees and crawls down the slope.We all crawl, since walking now seems as remarkable a feat as flying; we crawluntil the vines turn to a narrow strip of sandy beach and the warm water thatsurrounds the Cornucopia laps our faces. I jerk back as if I’ve touched an openflame.Rubbing salt in a wound. For the first time I truly appreciate the expression,because the salt in the water makes the pain of my wounds so blinding I nearlyblack out. But there’s another sensation, of drawing out. I experiment bygingerly placing only my hand in the water. Torturous, yes, but then less so.And through the blue layer of water, I see a milky substance leaching out of thewounds on my skin. As the whiteness diminishes, so does the pain. I unbuckle mybelt and strip off my jumpsuit, which is little more than a perforated rag. Myshoes and undergarments are inexplicably unaffected. Little by little, one smallportion of a limb at a time, I soak the poison out of my wounds. Peeta seems tobe doing the same. But Finnick backed away from the water at first touch andlies facedown on the sand, either unwilling or unable to purge himself.Finally, when I have survived the worst, opening my eyes underwater, sniffingwater into my sinuses and snorting it out, and even gargling repeatedly to washout my throat, I’m functional enough to help Finnick. Some feeling has returnedto my leg, but my arms are still riddled with spasms. I can’t drag Finnick intothe water, and possibly the pain would kill him, anyway. So I scoop up shakyhandfuls and empty them on his fists. Since he’s not underwater, the poisoncomes out of his wounds just as it went in, in wisps of fog that I take greatcare to steer clear of. Peeta recovers enough to help me. He cuts away Finnick’sjumpsuit. Somewhere he finds two shells that work much better than our hands do.We concentrate on soaking Finnick’s arms first, since they have been so badlydamaged, and even though a lot of white stuff pours out of them, he doesn’tnotice.He just lies there, eyes shut, giving an occasional moan.I look around with growing awareness of how dangerous a position we’re in. It’snight, yes, but this moon gives off too much light for concealment. We’re luckyno one’s attacked us yet. We could see them coming from the Cornucopia, but ifall four Careers attacked, they’d overpower us. If they didn’t spot us at first,Finnick’s moans would give us away soon.“We’ve got to get more of him into the water,” I whisper. But we can’t put himin face-first, not while he’s in this condition. Peeta nods to Finnick’s feet.We each take one, pull him one hundred and eighty degrees around, and start todrag him into the saltwater. Just a few inches at a time. His ankles. Wait a fewminutes. Up to his midcalf. Wait. His knees. Clouds of white swirl out from hisflesh and he groans. We continue to detoxify him, bit by bit. What I find isthat the longer I sit in the water, the better I feel. Not just my skin, but mybrain and muscle control continue to improve. I can see Peeta’s face beginningto return to normal, his eyelid opening, the grimace leaving his mouth.Finnick slowly begins to revive. His eyes open, focus on us, and registerawareness that he’s being helped. I rest his head on my lap and we let him soakabout ten minutes with everything immersed from the neck down. Peeta and Iexchange a smile as Finnick lifts his arms above the seawater.“There’s just your head left, Finnick. That’s the worst part, but you’ll feelmuch better after, if you can bear it,” Peeta says. We help him to sit up andlet him grip our hands as he purges his eyes and nose and mouth. His throat isstill too raw to speak.“I’m going to try to tap a tree,” I say. My fingers fumble at my belt and findthe spile still hanging from its vine.“Let me make the hole first,” says Peeta. “You stay with him. You’re thehealer.”That’s a joke, I think. But I don’t say it out loud, since Finnick has enough todeal with. He got the worst of the fog, although I’m not sure why. Maybe becausehe’s the biggest or maybe because he had to exert himself the most. And then, ofcourse, there’s Mags. I still don’t understand what happened there. Why heessentially abandoned her to carry Peeta. Why she not only didn’t question it,but ran straight to her death without a moment’s hesitation. Was it because shewas so old that her days were numbered, anyway? Did they think that Finnickwould stand a better chance of winning if he had Peeta and me as allies? Thehaggard look on Finnick’s face tells me that now is not the moment to ask.Instead I try to put myself back together. I rescue my mockingjay pin from myruined jumpsuit and pin it to the strap of my undershirt. The flotation beltmust be acid resistant, since it looks as good as new. I can swim, so theflotation belt’s not really necessary, but Brutus blocked my arrow with his, soI buckle it back on, thinking it might offer some protection. I undo my hair andcomb it with my fingers, thinning it out considerably since the fog dropletsdamaged it. Then I braid back what’s left of it.Peeta has found a good tree about ten yards from the narrow strip of beach. Wecan hardly see him, but the sound of his knife against the wooden trunk iscrystal clear. I wonder what happened to the awl. Mags must’ve either dropped itor taken it into the fog with her. Anyway, it’s gone.I have moved out a bit farther into the shallows, floating alternately on mybelly and back. If the seawater healed Peeta and me, it seems to be transformingFinnick altogether. He begins to move slowly, just testing his limbs, andgradually begins to swim. But it’s not like me swimming, the rhythmic strokes,the even pace. It’s like watching some strange sea animal coming back to life.He dives and surfaces, spraying water out of his mouth, rolls over and over insome bizarre corkscrew motion that makes me dizzy even to watch. And then, whenhe’s been underwater so long I feel certain he’s drowned, his head pops up rightnext to me and I start.“Don’t do that,” I say.“What? Come up or stay under?” he says.“Either. Neither. Whatever. Just soak in the water and behave,” I say. “Or ifyou feel this good, let’s go help Peeta.”In just the short time it takes to cross to the edge of the jungle, I becomeaware of the change. Put it down to years of hunting, or maybe my reconstructedear does work a little better than anyone intended. But I sense the mass of warmbodies poised above us. They don’t need to chatter or scream. The mere breathingof so many is enough.I touch Finnick’s arm and he follows my gaze upward. I don’t know how theyarrived so silently. Perhaps they didn’t. We’ve all been absorbed in restoringour bodies. During that time they’ve assembled. Not five or ten but scores ofmonkeys weigh down the limbs of the jungle trees. The pair we spotted when wefirst escaped the fog felt like a welcoming committee. This crew feels ominous.I arm my bow with two arrows and Finnick adjusts the trident in his hand.“Peeta,” I say as calmly as possible. “I need your help with something.”“Okay, just a minute. I think I’ve just about got it,” he says, still occupiedwith the tree. “Yes, there. Have you got the spile?”“I do. But we’ve found something you’d better take a look at,” I continue in ameasured voice. “Only move toward us quietly, so you don’t startle it.” For somereason, I don’t want him to notice the monkeys, or even glance their way. Thereare creatures that interpret mere eye contact as aggression.Peeta turns to us, panting from his work on the tree. The tone of my request isso odd that it’s alerted him to some irregularity. “Okay,” he says casually. Hebegins to move through the jungle, and although I know he’s trying hard to bequiet, this has never been his strong suit, even when he had two sound legs. Butit’s all right, he’s moving, the monkeys are holding their positions. He’s justfive yards from the beach when he senses them. His eyes only dart up for asecond, but it’s as if he’s triggered a bomb. The monkeys explode into ashrieking mass of orange fur and converge on him.I’ve never seen any animal move so fast. They slide down the vines as if thethings were greased. Leap impossible distances from tree to tree. Fangs bared,hackles raised, claws shooting out like switchblades. I may be unfamiliar withmonkeys, but animals in nature don’t act like this. “Mutts!” I spit out asFinnick and I crash into the greenery.I know every arrow must count, and they do. In the eerie light, I bring downmonkey after monkey, targeting eyes and hearts and throats, so that each hitmeans a death. But still it wouldn’t be enough without Finnick spearing thebeasts like fish and flinging them aside, Peeta slashing away with his knife. Ifeel claws on my leg, down my back, before someone takes out the attacker. Theair grows heavy with trampled plants, the scent of blood, and the musty stink ofthe monkeys. Peeta and Finnick and I position ourselves in a triangle, a fewyards apart, our backs to one another. My heart sinks as my fingers draw back mylast arrow. Then I remember Peeta has a sheath, too. And he’s not shooting, he’shacking away with that knife. My own knife is out now, but the monkeys arequicker, can spring in and out so fast you can barely react.“Peeta!” I shout. “Your arrows!”Peeta turns to see my predicament and is sliding off his sheath when it happens.A monkey lunges out of a tree for his chest. I have no arrow, no way to shoot. Ican hear the thud of Finnick’s trident finding another mark and know his weaponis occupied. Peeta’s knife arm is disabled as he tries to remove the sheath. Ithrow my knife at the oncoming mutt but the creature somersaults, evading theblade, and stays on its trajectory.Weaponless, defenseless, I do the only thing I can think of. I run for Peeta, toknock him to the ground, to protect his body with mine, even though I know Iwon’t make it in time.She does, though. Materializing, it seems, from thin air. One moment nowhere,the next reeling in front of Peeta. Already bloody, mouth open in a high-pitchedscream, pupils enlarged so her eyes seem like black holes.The insane morphling from District 6 throws up her skeletal arms as if toembrace the monkey, and it sinks its fangs into her chest."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00016.jpg]Peeta drops the sheath and buries his knife into the monkey’s back, stabbing itagain and again until it releases its jaw. He kicks the mutt away, bracing formore. I have his arrows now, a loaded bow, and Finnick at my back, breathinghard but not actively engaged.“Come on, then! Come on!” shouts Peeta, panting with rage. But something hashappened to the monkeys. They are withdrawing, backing up trees, fading into thejungle, as if some unheard voice calls them away. A Gamemaker’s voice, tellingthem this is enough.“Get her,” I say to Peeta. “We’ll cover you.”Peeta gently lifts up the morphling and carries her the last few yards to thebeach while Finnick and I keep our weapons at the ready. But except for theorange carcasses on the ground, the monkeys are gone. Peeta lays the morphlingon the sand. I cut away the material over her chest, revealing the four deeppuncture wounds. Blood slowly trickles from them, making them look far lessdeadly than they are. The real damage is inside. By the position of theopenings, I feel certain the beast ruptured something vital, a lung, maybe evenher heart.She lies on the sand, gasping like a fish out of water. Sagging skin, sicklygreen, her ribs as prominent as a child’s dead of starvation. Surely she couldafford food, but turned to the morphling just as Haymitch turned to drink, Iguess. Everything about her speaks of waste — her body, her life, the vacantlook in her eyes. I hold one of her twitching hands, unclear whether it movesfrom the poison that affected our nerves, the shock of the attack, or withdrawalfrom the drug that was her sustenance. There is nothing we can do. Nothing butstay with her while she dies.“I’ll watch the trees,” Finnick says before walking away. I’d like to walk away,too, but she grips my hand so tightly I would have to pry off her fingers, and Idon’t have the strength for that kind of cruelty. I think of Rue, how maybe Icould sing a song or something. But I don’t even know the morphling’s name, letalone if she likes songs. I just know she’s dying.Peeta crouches down on the other side of her and strokes her hair. When hebegins to speak in a soft voice, it seems almost nonsensical, but the wordsaren’t for me. “With my paint box at home, I can make every color imaginable.Pink. As pale as a baby’s skin. Or as deep as rhubarb. Green like spring grass.Blue that shimmers like ice on water.”The morphling stares into Peeta’s eyes, hanging on to his words.“One time, I spent three days mixing paint until I found the right shade forsunlight on white fur. You see, I kept thinking it was yellow, but it was muchmore than that. Layers of all sorts of color. One by one,” says Peeta.The morphling’s breathing is slowing into shallow catch-breaths. Her free handdabbles in the blood on her chest, making the tiny swirling motions she so lovedto paint with.“I haven’t figured out a rainbow yet. They come so quickly and leave so soon. Inever have enough time to capture them. Just a bit of blue here or purple there.And then they fade away again. Back into the air,” says Peeta.The morphling seems mesmerized by Peeta’s words. Entranced. She lifts up atrembling hand and paints what I think might be a flower on Peeta’s cheek.“Thank you,” he whispers. “That looks beautiful.”For a moment, the morphling’s face lights up in a grin and she makes a smallsqueaking sound. Then her blood-dappled hand falls back onto her chest, shegives one last huff of air, and the cannon fires. The grip on my hand releases.Peeta carries her out into the water. He returns and sits beside me. Themorphling floats out toward the Cornucopia for a while, then the hovercraftappears and a four-pronged claw drops, encases her, carries her into the nightsky, and she’s gone.Finnick rejoins us, his fist full of my arrows still wet with monkey blood. Hedrops them beside me on the sand. “Thought you might want these.”“Thanks,” I say. I wade into the water and wash off the gore, from my weapons,my wounds. By the time I return to the jungle to gather some moss to dry them,all the monkeys’ bodies have vanished.“Where did they go?” I ask.“We don’t know exactly. The vines shifted and they were gone,” says Finnick.We stare at the jungle, numb and exhausted. In the quiet, I notice that thespots where the fog droplets touched my skin have scabbed over. They’ve stoppedhurting and begun to itch. Intensely. I try to think of this as a good sign.That they are healing. I glance over at Peeta, at Finnick, and see they’re bothscratching at their damaged faces. Yes, even Finnick’s beauty has been marred bythis night.“Don’t scratch,” I say, wanting badly to scratch myself. But I know it’s theadvice my mother would give. “You’ll only bring infection. Think it’s safe totry for the water again?”We make our way back to the tree Peeta was tapping. Finnick and I stand with ourweapons poised while he works the spile in, but no threat appears. Peeta’s founda good vein and the water begins to gush from the spile. We slake our thirst,let the warm water pour over our itching bodies. We fill a handful of shellswith drinking water and go back to the beach.It’s still night, though dawn can’t be too many hours away. Unless theGamemakers want it to be. “Why don’t you two get some rest?” I say. “I’ll watchfor a while.”“No, Katniss, I’d rather,” says Finnick. I look in his eyes, at his face, andrealize he’s barely holding back tears. Mags. The least I can do is give him theprivacy to mourn her.“All right, Finnick, thanks,” I say. I lie down on the sand with Peeta, whodrifts off at once. I stare into the night, thinking of what a difference a daymakes. How yesterday morning, Finnick was on my kill list, and now I’m willingto sleep with him as my guard. He saved Peeta and let Mags die and I don’t knowwhy. Only that I can never settle the balance owed between us. All I can do atthe moment is go to sleep and let him grieve in peace. And so I do.It’s midmorning when I open my eyes again. Peeta’s still out beside me. Aboveus, a mat of grass suspended on branches shields our faces from the sunlight. Isit up and see that Finnick’s hands have not been idle. Two woven bowls arefilled with fresh water. A third holds a mess of shellfish.Finnick sits on the sand, cracking them open with a stone. “They’re betterfresh,” he says, ripping a chunk of flesh from a shell and popping it into hismouth. His eyes are still puffy but I pretend not to notice.My stomach begins to growl at the smell of food and I reach for one. The sightof my fingernails, caked with blood, stops me. I’ve been scratching my skin rawin my sleep.“You know, if you scratch you’ll bring on infection,” says Finnick.“That’s what I’ve heard,” I say. I go into the saltwater and wash off the blood,trying to decide which I hate more, pain or itching. Fed up, I stomp back ontothe beach, turn my face upward, and snap, “Hey, Haymitch, if you’re not toodrunk, we could use a little something for our skin.”It’s almost funny how quickly the parachute appears above me. I reach up and thetube lands squarely in my open hand. “About time,” I say, but I can’t keep thescowl on my face. Haymitch. What I wouldn’t give for five minutes ofconversation with him.I plunk down on the sand next to Finnick and screw the lid off the tube. Insideis a thick, dark ointment with a pungent smell, a combination of tar and pineneedles. I wrinkle my nose as I squeeze a glob of the medicine onto my palm andbegin to massage it into my leg. A sound of pleasure slips out of my mouth asthe stuff eradicates my itching. It also stains my scabby skin a ghastlygray-green. As I start on the second leg I toss the tube to Finnick, who eyes medoubtfully.“It’s like you’re decomposing,” says Finnick. But I guess the itching wins out,because after a minute Finnick begins to treat his own skin, too. Really, thecombination of the scabs and the ointment looks hideous. I can’t help enjoyinghis distress.“Poor Finnick. Is this the first time in your life you haven’t looked pretty?” Isay.“It must be. The sensation’s completely new. How have you managed it all theseyears?” he asks.“Just avoid mirrors. You’ll forget about it,” I say.“Not if I keep looking at you,” he says.We slather ourselves down, even taking turns rubbing the ointment into eachother’s backs where the undershirts don’t protect our skin. “I’m going to wakePeeta,” I say.“No, wait,” says Finnick. “Let’s do it together. Put our faces right in front ofhis.”Well, there’s so little opportunity for fun left in my life, I agree. Weposition ourselves on either side of Peeta, lean over until our faces are inchesfrom his nose, and give him a shake. “Peeta. Peeta, wake up,” I say in a soft,singsong voice.His eyelids flutter open and then he jumps like we’ve stabbed him. “Aa!”Finnick and I fall back in the sand, laughing our heads off. Every time we tryto stop, we look at Peeta’s attempt to maintain a disdainful expression and itsets us off again. By the time we pull ourselves together, I’m thinking thatmaybe Finnick Odair is all right. At least not as vain or self-important as I’dthought. Not so bad at all, really. And just as I’ve come to this conclusion, aparachute lands next to us with a fresh loaf of bread. Remembering from lastyear how Haymitch’s gifts are often timed to send a message, I make a note tomyself. Be friends with Finnick. You’ll get food.Finnick turns the bread over in his hands, examining the crust. A bit toopossessively. It’s not necessary. It’s got that green tint from seaweed that thebread from District 4 always has. We all know it’s his. Maybe he’s just realizedhow precious it is, and that he may never see another loaf again. Maybe somememory of Mags is associated with the crust. But all he says is, “This will gowell with the shellfish.”While I help Peeta coat his skin with the ointment, Finnick deftly cleans themeat from the shellfish. We gather round and eat the delicious sweet flesh withthe salty bread from District 4.We all look monstrous — the ointment seems to be causing some of the scabs topeel — but I’m glad for the medicine. Not just because it gives relief from theitching, but also because it acts as protection from that blazing white sun inthe pink sky. By its position, I estimate it must be going on ten o’clock, thatwe’ve been in the arena for about a day. Eleven of us are dead. Thirteen alive.Somewhere in the jungle, ten are concealed. Three or four are the Careers. Idon’t really feel like trying to remember who the others are.For me, the jungle has quickly evolved from a place of protection to a sinistertrap. I know at some point we’ll be forced to reenter its depths, either to huntor be hunted, but for right now I’m planning to stick to our little beach. And Idon’t hear Peeta or Finnick suggesting we do otherwise. For a while the jungleseems almost static, humming, shimmering, but not flaunting its dangers. Then,in the distance, comes screaming. Across from us, a wedge of the jungle beginsto vibrate. An enormous wave crests high on the hill, topping the trees androaring down the slope. It hits the existing seawater with such force that, eventhough we’re as far as we can get from it, the surf bubbles up around our knees,setting our few possessions afloat. Among the three of us, we manage to collecteverything before it’s carried off, except for our chemical-riddled jumpsuits,which are so eaten away no one cares if we lose them.A cannon fires. We see the hovercraft appear over the area where the wave beganand pluck a body from the trees. Twelve, I think.The circle of water slowly calms down, having absorbed the giant wave. Werearrange our things back on the wet sand and are about to settle down when Isee them. Three figures, about two spokes away, stumbling onto the beach.“There,” I say quietly, nodding in the newcomers’ direction. Peeta and Finnickfollow my gaze. As if by previous agreement, we all fade back into the shadowsof the jungle.The trio’s in bad shape — you can see that right off. One is being practicallydragged out by a second, and the third wanders in loopy circles, as if deranged.They’re a solid brick-red color, as if they’ve been dipped in paint and left outto dry.“Who is that?” asks Peeta. “Or what? Muttations?”I draw back an arrow, readying for an attack. But all that happens is that theone who was being dragged collapses on the beach. The dragger stamps the groundin frustration and, in an apparent fit of temper, turns and shoves the circling,deranged one over.Finnick’s face lights up. “Johanna!” he calls, and runs for the red things.“Finnick!” I hear Johanna’s voice reply.I exchange a look with Peeta. “What now?” I ask.“We can’t really leave Finnick,” he says.“Guess not. Come on, then,” I say grouchily, because even if I’d had a list ofallies, Johanna Mason would definitely not have been on it. The two of us trompdown the beach to where Finnick and Johanna are just meeting up. As we move incloser, I see her companions, and confusion sets in. That’s Beetee on the groundon his back and Wiress who’s regained her feet to continue making loops. “She’sgot Wiress and Beetee.”“Nuts and Volts?” says Peeta, equally puzzled. “I’ve got to hear how thishappened.”When we reach them, Johanna’s gesturing toward the jungle and talking very fastto Finnick. “We thought it was rain, you know, because of the lightning, and wewere all so thirsty. But when it started coming down, it turned out to be blood.Thick, hot blood. You couldn’t see, you couldn’t speak without getting amouthful. We just staggered around, trying to get out of it. That’s when Blighthit the force field.”“I’m sorry, Johanna,” says Finnick. It takes a moment to place Blight. I thinkhe was Johanna’s male counterpart from District 7, but I hardly remember seeinghim. Come to think of it, I don’t even think he showed up for training.“Yeah, well, he wasn’t much, but he was from home,” she says. “And he left mealone with these two.” She nudges Beetee, who’s barely conscious, with her shoe.“He got a knife in the back at the Cornucopia. And her — ”We all look over at Wiress, who’s circling around, coated in dried blood, andmurmuring, “Tick, tock. Tick, tock.”“Yeah, we know. Tick, tock. Nuts is in shock,” says Johanna. This seems to drawWiress in her direction and she careens into Johanna, who harshly shoves her tothe beach. “Just stay down, will you?”“Lay off her,” I snap.Johanna narrows her brown eyes at me in hatred. “Lay off her?” she hisses. Shesteps forward before I can react and slaps me so hard I see stars. “Who do youthink got them out of that bleeding jungle for you? You — ” Finnick tosses herwrithing body over his shoulder and carries her out into the water andrepeatedly dunks her while she screams a lot of really insulting things at me.But I don’t shoot. Because she’s with Finnick and because of what she said,about getting them for me.“What did she mean? She got them for me?” I ask Peeta.“I don’t know. You did want them originally,” he reminds me.“Yeah, I did. Originally.” But that answers nothing. I look down at Beetee’sinert body. “But I won’t have them long unless we do something.”Peeta lifts Beetee up in his arms and I take Wiress by the hand and we go backto our little beach camp. I sit Wiress in the shallows so she can get washed upa bit, but she just clutches her hands together and occasionally mumbles, “Tick,tock.” I unhook Beetee’s belt and find a heavy metal cylinder attached to theside with a rope of vines. I can’t tell what it is, but if he thought it wasworth saving, I’m not going to be the one who loses it. I toss it up on thesand. Beetee’s clothes are glued to him with blood, so Peeta holds him in thewater while I loosen them. It takes some time to get the jumpsuit off, and thenwe find his under-garments are saturated with blood as well. There’s no choicebut to strip him naked to get him clean, but I have to say this doesn’t makemuch of an impression on me anymore. Our kitchen table’s been full of so manynaked men this year. You kind of get used to it after a while.We put down Finnick’s mat and lay Beetee on his stomach so we can examine hisback. There’s a gash about six inches long running from his shoulder blade tobelow his ribs. Fortunately it’s not too deep. He’s lost a lot of blood, though— you can tell by the pallor of his skin — and it’s still oozing out of thewound.I sit back on my heels, trying to think. What do I have to work with? Seawater?I feel like my mother when her first line of defense for treating everything wassnow. I look over at the jungle. I bet there’s a whole pharmacy in there if Iknew how to use it. But these aren’t my plants. Then I think about the moss Magsgave me to blow my nose. “Be right back,” I tell Peeta. Fortunately the stuffseems to be pretty common in the jungle. I rip an armful from the nearby treesand carry it back to the beach. I make a thick pad out of the moss, place it onBeetee’s cut, and secure it by tying vines around his body. We get some waterinto him and then pull him into the shade at the edge of the jungle.“I think that’s all we can do,” I say.“It’s good. You’re good with this healing stuff,” he says. “It’s in your blood.”“No,” I say, shaking my head. “I got my father’s blood.” The kind that quickensduring a hunt, not an epidemic. “I’m going to see about Wiress.”I take a handful of the moss to use as a rag and join Wiress in the shallows.She doesn’t resist as I work off her clothing, scrub the blood from her skin.But her eyes are dilated with fear, and when I speak, she doesn’t respond exceptto say with ever-increasing urgency, “Tick, tock.” She does seem to be trying totell me something, but with no Beetee to explain her thoughts, I’m at a loss.“Yes, tick, tock. Tick, tock,” I say. This seems to calm her down a little. Iwash out her jumpsuit until there’s hardly a trace of blood, and help her backinto it. It’s not damaged like ours were. Her belt’s fine, so I fasten that on,too. Then I pin her undergarments, along with Beetee’s, under some rocks and letthem soak.By the time I’ve rinsed out Beetee’s jumpsuit, a shiny clean Johanna and peelingFinnick have joined us. For a while, Johanna gulps water and stuffs herself withshellfish while I try to coax something into Wiress. Finnick tells about the fogand the monkeys in a detached, almost clinical voice, avoiding the mostimportant detail of the story.Everybody offers to guard while the others rest, but in the end, it’s Johannaand I who stay up. Me because I’m really rested, she because she simply refusesto lie down. The two of us sit in silence on the beach until the others havegone to sleep.Johanna glances over at Finnick, to be sure, then turns to me. “How’d you loseMags?”“In the fog. Finnick had Peeta. I had Mags for a while. Then I couldn’t lifther. Finnick said he couldn’t take them both. She kissed him and walked rightinto the poison,” I say.“She was Finnick’s mentor, you know,” Johanna says accusingly.“No, I didn’t,” I say.“She was half his family,” she says a few moments later, but there’s less venombehind it.We watch the water lap up over the undergarments. “So what were you doing withNuts and Volts?” I ask.“I told you — I got them for you. Haymitch said if we were to be allies I had tobring them to you,” says Johanna. “That’s what you told him, right?”No, I think. But I nod my head in assent. “Thanks. I appreciate it.”“I hope so.” She gives me a look filled with loathing, like I’m the biggest dragpossible on her life. I wonder if this is what it’s like to have an older sisterwho really hates you.“Tick, tock,” I hear behind me. I turn and see Wiress has crawled over. Her eyesare focused on the jungle.“Oh, goody, she’s back. Okay, I’m going to sleep. You and Nuts can guardtogether,” Johanna says. She goes over and flings herself down beside Finnick.“Tick, tock,” whispers Wiress. I guide her in front of me and get her to liedown, stroking her arm to soothe her. She drifts off, stirring restlessly,occasionally sighing out her phrase. “Tick, tock.”“Tick, tock,” I agree softly. “It’s time for bed. Tick, tock. Go to sleep.”The sun rises in the sky until it’s directly over us. It must be noon, I thinkabsently. Not that it matters. Across the water, off to the right, I see theenormous flash as the lightning bolt hits the tree and the electrical stormbegins again. Right in the same area it did last night. Someone must have movedinto its range, triggered the attack. I sit for a while watching the lightning,keeping Wiress calm, lulled into a sort of peacefulness by the lapping of thewater. I think of last night, how the lightning began just after the belltolled. Twelve bongs.“Tick, tock,” Wiress says, surfacing to consciousness for a moment and thengoing back under.Twelve bongs last night. Like it was midnight. Then lightning. The sun overheadnow. Like it’s noon. And lightning.Slowly I rise up and survey the arena. The lightning there. In the next piewedge over came the blood rain, where Johanna, Wiress, and Beetee were caught.We would have been in the third section, right next to that, when the fogappeared. And as soon as it was sucked away, the monkeys began to gather in thefourth. Tick, tock. My head snaps to the other side. A couple of hours ago, ataround ten, that wave came out of the second section to the left of where thelightning strikes now. At noon. At midnight. At noon.“Tick, tock,” Wiress says in her sleep. As the lightning ceases and the bloodrain begins just to the right of it, her words suddenly make sense.“Oh,” I say under my breath. “Tick, tock.” My eyes sweep around the full circleof the arena and I know she’s right. “Tick, tock. This is a clock.”"},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00008.jpg]A clock. I can almost see the hands ticking around the twelve-sectioned face ofthe arena. Each hour begins a new horror, a new Gamemaker weapon, and ends theprevious. Lightning, blood rain, fog, monkeys — those are the first four hourson the clock. And at ten, the wave. I don’t know what happens in the otherseven, but I know Wiress is right.At present, the blood rain’s falling and we’re on the beach below the monkeysegment, far too close to the fog for my liking. Do the various attacks staywithin the confines of the jungle? Not necessarily. The wave didn’t. If that fogleaches out of the jungle, or the monkeys return . . .“Get up,” I order, shaking Peeta and Finnick and Johanna awake. “Get up — wehave to move.” There’s enough time, though, to explain the clock theory to them.About Wiress’s tick-tocking and how the movements of the invisible hands triggera deadly force in each section.I think I’ve convinced everyone who’s conscious except Johanna, who’s naturallyopposed to liking anything I suggest. But even she agrees it’s better to be safethan sorry.While the others collect our few possessions and get Beetee back into hisjumpsuit, I rouse Wiress. She awakes with a panicked “tick, tock!”“Yes, tick, tock, the arena’s a clock. It’s a clock, Wiress, you were right,” Isay. “You were right.”Relief floods her face — I guess because somebody has finally understood whatshe’s known probably from the first tolling of the bells. “Midnight.”“It starts at midnight,” I confirm.A memory struggles to surface in my brain. I see a clock. No, it’s a watch,resting in Plutarch Heavensbee’s palm. “It starts at midnight,” Plutarch said.And then my mockingjay lit up briefly and vanished. In retrospect, it’s like hewas giving me a clue about the arena. But why would he? At the time, I was nomore a tribute in these Games than he was. Maybe he thought it would help me asa mentor. Or maybe this had been the plan all along.Wiress nods at the blood rain. “One-thirty,” she says.“Exactly. One-thirty. And at two, a terrible poisonous fog begins there,” I say,pointing at the nearby jungle. “So we have to move somewhere safe now.” Shesmiles and stands up obediently. “Are you thirsty?” I hand her the woven bowland she gulps down about a quart. Finnick gives her the last bit of bread andshe gnaws on it. With the inability to communicate overcome, she’s functioningagain.I check my weapons. Tie up the spile and the tube of medicine in the parachuteand fix it to my belt with vine.Beetee’s still pretty out of it, but when Peeta tries to lift him, he objects.“Wire,” he says.“She’s right here,” Peeta tells him. “Wiress is fine. She’s coming, too.”But still Beetee struggles. “Wire,” he insists.“Oh, I know what he wants,” says Johanna impatiently. She crosses the beach andpicks up the cylinder we took from his belt when we were bathing him. It’scoated in a thick layer of congealed blood. “This worthless thing. It’s somekind of wire or something. That’s how he got cut. Running up to the Cornucopiato get this. I don’t know what kind of weapon it’s supposed to be. I guess youcould pull off a piece and use it as a garrote or something. But really, can youimagine Beetee garroting somebody?”“He won his Games with wire. Setting up that electrical trap,” says Peeta. “It’sthe best weapon he could have.”There’s something odd about Johanna not putting this together. Something thatdoesn’t quite ring true. Suspicious. “Seems like you’d have figured that out,” Isay. “Since you nicknamed him Volts and all.”Johanna’s eyes narrow at me dangerously. “Yeah, that was really stupid of me,wasn’t it?” she says. “I guess I must have been distracted by keeping yourlittle friends alive. While you were . . . what, again? Getting Mags killedoff?”My fingers tighten on the knife handle at my belt.“Go ahead. Try it. I don’t care if you are knocked up, I’ll rip your throatout,” says Johanna.I know I can’t kill her right now. But it’s just a matter of time with Johannaand me. Before one of us offs the other.“Maybe we all had better be careful where we step,” says Finnick, shooting me alook. He takes the coil and sets it on Beetee’s chest. “There’s your wire,Volts. Watch where you plug it.”Peeta picks up the now-unresisting Beetee. “Where to?”“I’d like to go to the Cornucopia and watch. Just to make sure we’re right aboutthe clock,” says Finnick. It seems as good a plan as any. Besides, I wouldn’tmind the chance of going over the weapons again. And there are six of us now.Even if you count Beetee and Wiress out, we’ve got four good fighters. It’s sodifferent from where I was last year at this point, doing everything on my own.Yes, it’s great to have allies as long as you can ignore the thought that you’llhave to kill them.Beetee and Wiress will probably find some way to die on their own. If we have torun from something, how far would they get? Johanna, frankly, I could easilykill if it came down to protecting Peeta. Or maybe even just to shut her up.What I really need is for someone to take out Finnick for me, since I don’tthink I can do it personally. Not after all he’s done for Peeta. I think aboutmaneuvering him into some kind of encounter with the Careers. It’s cold, I know.But what are my options? Now that we know about the clock, he probably won’t diein the jungle, so someone’s going to have to kill him in battle.Because this is so repellent to think about, my mind frantically tries to changetopics. But the only thing that distracts me from my current situation isfantasizing about killing President Snow. Not very pretty daydreams for aseventeen-year-old girl, I guess, but very satisfying.We walk down the nearest sand strip, approaching the Cornucopia with care, justin case the Careers are concealed there. I doubt they are, because we’ve been onthe beach for hours and there’s been no sign of life. The area’s abandoned, as Iexpected. Only the big golden horn and the picked-over pile of weapons remain.When Peeta lays Beetee in the bit of shade the Cornucopia provides, he calls outto Wiress. She crouches beside him and he puts the coil of wire in her hands.“Clean it, will you?” he asks.Wiress nods and scampers over to the water’s edge, where she dunks the coil inthe water. She starts quietly singing some funny little song, about a mouserunning up a clock. It must be for children, but it seems to make her happy.“Oh, not the song again,” says Johanna, rolling her eyes. “That went on forhours before she started tick-tocking.”Suddenly Wiress stands up very straight and points to the jungle. “Two,” shesays.I follow her finger to where the wall of fog has just begun to seep out onto thebeach. “Yes, look, Wiress is right. It’s two o’clock and the fog has started.”“Like clockwork,” says Peeta. “You were very smart to figure that out, Wiress.”Wiress smiles and goes back to singing and dunking her coil. “Oh, she’s morethan smart,” says Beetee. “She’s intuitive.” We all turn to look at Beetee, whoseems to be coming back to life. “She can sense things before anyone else. Likea canary in one of your coal mines.”“What’s that?” Finnick asks me.“It’s a bird that we take down into the mines to warn us if there’s bad air,” Isay.“What’s it do, die?” asks Johanna.“It stops singing first. That’s when you should get out. But if the air’s toobad, it dies, yes. And so do you.” I don’t want to talk about dying songbirds.They bring up thoughts of my father’s death and Rue’s death and MaysileeDonner’s death and my mother inheriting her songbird. Oh, great, and now I’mthinking of Gale, deep down in that horrible mine, with President Snow’s threathanging over his head. So easy to make it look like an accident down there. Asilent canary, a spark, and nothing more.I go back to imagining killing the president.Despite her annoyance at Wiress, Johanna’s as happy as I’ve seen her in thearena. While I’m adding to my stock of arrows, she pokes around until she comesup with a pair of lethal-looking axes. It seems an odd choice until I see herthrow one with such force it sticks in the sun-softened gold of the Cornucopia.Of course. Johanna Mason. District 7. Lumber. I bet she’s been tossing aroundaxes since she could toddle. It’s like Finnick with his trident. Or Beetee withhis wire. Rue with her knowledge of plants. I realize it’s just anotherdisadvantage the District 12 tributes have faced over the years. We don’t godown in the mines until we’re eighteen. It looks like most of the other tributeslearn something about their trades early on. There are things you do in a minethat could come in handy in the Games. Wielding a pick. Blowing things up. Giveyou an edge. The way my hunting did. But we learn them too late.While I’ve been messing with the weapons, Peeta’s been squatting on the ground,drawing something with the tip of his knife on a large, smooth leaf he broughtfrom the jungle. I look over his shoulder and see he’s creating a map of thearena. In the center is the Cornucopia on its circle of sand with the twelvestrips branching out from it. It looks like a pie sliced into twelve equalwedges. There’s another circle representing the waterline and a slightly largerone indicating the edge of the jungle. “Look how the Cornucopia’s positioned,”he says to me.I examine the Cornucopia and see what he means. “The tail points toward twelveo’clock,” I say.“Right, so this is the top of our clock,” he says, and quickly scratches thenumbers one through twelve around the clock face. “Twelve to one is thelightning zone.” He writes lightning in tiny print in the corresponding wedge,then works clockwise adding blood, fog, and monkeys in the following sections.“And ten to eleven is the wave,” I say. He adds it. Finnick and Johanna join usat this point, armed to the teeth with tridents, axes, and knives.“Did you notice anything unusual in the others?” I ask Johanna and Beetee, sincethey might have seen something we didn’t. But all they’ve seen is a lot ofblood. “I guess they could hold anything.”“I’m going to mark the ones where we know the Gamemakers’ weapon follows us outpast the jungle, so we’ll stay clear of those,” says Peeta, drawing diagonallines on the fog and wave beaches. Then he sits back. “Well, it’s a lot morethan we knew this morning, anyway.”We all nod in agreement, and that’s when I notice it. The silence. Our canaryhas stopped singing.I don’t wait. I load an arrow as I twist and get a glimpse of a dripping-wetGloss letting Wiress slide to the ground, her throat slit open in a bright redsmile. The point of my arrow disappears into his right temple, and in theinstant it takes to reload, Johanna has buried an ax blade in Cashmere’s chest.Finnick knocks away a spear Brutus throws at Peeta and takes Enobaria’s knife inhis thigh. If there wasn’t a Cornucopia to duck behind, they’d be dead, both ofthe tributes from District 2. I spring forward in pursuit. Boom! Boom! Boom! Thecannon confirms there’s no way to help Wiress, no need to finish off Gloss orCashmere. My allies and I are rounding the horn, starting to give chase toBrutus and Enobaria, who are sprinting down a sand strip toward the jungle.Suddenly the ground jerks beneath my feet and I’m flung on my side in the sand.The circle of land that holds the Cornucopia starts spinning fast, really fast,and I can see the jungle going by in a blur. I feel the centrifugal forcepulling me toward the water and dig my hands and feet into the sand, trying toget some purchase on the unstable ground. Between the flying sand and thedizziness, I have to squeeze my eyes shut. There is literally nothing I can dobut hold on until, with no deceleration, we slam to a stop.Coughing and queasy, I sit up slowly to find my companions in the samecondition. Finnick, Johanna, and Peeta have hung on. The three dead bodies havebeen tossed out into the seawater.The whole thing, from missing Wiress’s song to now, can’t have taken more than aminute or two. We sit there panting, scraping the sand out of our mouths.“Where’s Volts?” says Johanna. We’re on our feet. One wobbly circle of theCornucopia confirms he’s gone. Finnick spots him about twenty yards out in thewater, barely keeping afloat, and swims out to haul him in.That’s when I remember the wire and how important it was to him. I lookfrantically around. Where is it? Where is it? And then I see it, still clutchedin Wiress’s hands, far out in the water. My stomach contracts at the thought ofwhat I must do next. “Cover me,” I say to the others. I toss aside my weaponsand race down the strip closest to her body. Without slowing down, I dive intothe water and start for her. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see thehovercraft appearing over us, the claw starting to descend to take her away. ButI don’t stop. I just keep swimming as hard as I can and end up slamming into herbody. I come up gasping, trying to avoid swallowing the bloodstained water thatspreads out from the open wound in her neck. She’s floating on her back, borneup by her belt and death, staring into that relentless sun. As I tread water, Ihave to wrench the coil of wire from her fingers, because her final grip on itis so tight. There’s nothing I can do then but close her eyelids, whispergood-bye, and swim away. By the time I swing the coil up onto the sand and pullmyself from the water, her body’s gone. But I can still taste her blood mingledwith the sea salt.I walk back to the Cornucopia. Finnick’s gotten Beetee back alive, although alittle waterlogged, sitting up and snorting out water. He had the good sense tohang on to his glasses, so at least he can see. I place the reel of wire on hislap. It’s sparkling clean, no blood left at all. He unravels a piece of the wireand runs it through his fingers. For the first time I see it, and it’s unlikeany wire I know. A pale golden color and as fine as a piece of hair. I wonderhow long it is. There must be miles of the stuff to fill the large spool. But Idon’t ask, because I know he’s thinking of Wiress.I look at the others’ sober faces. Now Finnick, Johanna, and Beetee have alllost their district partners. I cross to Peeta and wrap my arms around him, andfor a while we all stay silent.“Let’s get off this stinking island,” Johanna says finally. There’s only thematter of our weapons now, which we’ve largely retained. Fortunately the vineshere are strong and the spile and tube of medicine wrapped in the parachute arestill secured to my belt. Finnick strips off his undershirt and ties it aroundthe wound Enobaria’s knife made in his thigh; it’s not deep. Beetee thinks hecan walk now, if we go slowly, so I help him up. We decide to head to the beachat twelve o’clock. That should provide hours of calm and keep us clear of anypoisonous residue. And then Peeta, Johanna, and Finnick head off in threedifferent directions.“Twelve o’clock, right?” says Peeta. “The tail points at twelve.”“Before they spun us,” says Finnick. “I was judging by the sun.”“The sun only tells you it’s going on four, Finnick,” I say.“I think Katniss’s point is, knowing the time doesn’t mean you necessarily knowwhere four is on the clock. You might have a general idea of the direction.Unless you consider that they may have shifted the outer ring of jungle aswell,” says Beetee.No, Katniss’s point was a lot more basic than that. Beetee’s articulated atheory far beyond my comment on the sun. But I just nod my head like I’ve beenon the same page all along. “Yes, so any one of these paths could lead to twelveo’clock,” I say.We circle around the Cornucopia, scrutinizing the jungle. It has a bafflinguniformity. I remember the tall tree that took the first lightning strike attwelve o’clock, but every sector has a similar tree. Johanna thinks to followEnobaria’s and Brutus’s tracks, but they have been blown or washed away. There’sno way to tell where anything is. “I should have never mentioned the clock,” Isay bitterly. “Now they’ve taken that advantage away as well.”“Only temporarily,” says Beetee. “At ten, we’ll see the wave again and be backon track.”“Yes, they can’t redesign the whole arena,” says Peeta.“It doesn’t matter,” says Johanna impatiently. “You had to tell us or we neverwould have moved our camp in the first place, brainless.” Ironically, herlogical, if demeaning, reply is the only one that comforts me. Yes, I had totell them to get them to move. “Come on, I need water. Anyone have a good gutfeeling?”We randomly choose a path and take it, having no idea what number we’re headedfor. When we reach the jungle, we peer into it, trying to decipher what may bewaiting inside.“Well, it must be monkey hour. And I don’t see any of them in there,” saysPeeta. “I’m going to try to tap a tree.”“No, it’s my turn,” says Finnick.“I’ll at least watch your back,” Peeta says.“Katniss can do that,” says Johanna. “We need you to make another map. The otherwashed away.” She yanks a large leaf off a tree and hands it to him.For a moment, I’m suspicious they’re trying to divide and kill us. But itdoesn’t make sense. I’ll have the advantage on Finnick if he’s dealing with thetree and Peeta’s much bigger than Johanna. So I follow Finnick about fifteenyards into the jungle, where he finds a good tree and starts stabbing to make ahole with his knife.As I stand there, weapons ready, I can’t lose the uneasy feeling that somethingis going on and that it has to do with Peeta. I retrace our steps, starting fromthe moment the gong rang out, searching for the source of my discomfort. Finnicktowing Peeta in off his metal plate. Finnick reviving Peeta after the forcefield stopped his heart. Mags running into the fog so that Finnick could carryPeeta. The morphling hurling herself in front of him to block the monkey’sattack. The fight with the Careers was so quick, but didn’t Finnick blockBrutus’s spear from hitting Peeta even though it meant taking Enobaria’s knifein his leg? And even now Johanna has him drawing a map on a leaf rather thanrisking the jungle. . . .There is no question about it. For reasons completely unfathomable to me, someof the other victors are trying to keep him alive, even if it means sacrificingthemselves.I’m dumbfounded. For one thing, that’s my job. For another, it doesn’t makesense. Only one of us can get out. So why have they chosen Peeta to protect?What has Haymitch possibly said to them, what has he bargained with to make themput Peeta’s life above their own?I know my own reasons for keeping Peeta alive. He’s my friend, and this is myway to defy the Capitol, to subvert its terrible Games. But if I had no realties to him, what would make me want to save him, to choose him over myself?Certainly he is brave, but we have all been brave enough to survive a Games.There is that quality of goodness that’s hard to overlook, but still . . . andthen I think of it, what Peeta can do so much better than the rest of us. He canuse words. He obliterated the rest of the field at both interviews. And maybeit’s because of that underlying goodness that he can move a crowd — no, acountry — to his side with the turn of a simple sentence.I remember thinking that was the gift the leader of our revolution should have.Has Haymitch convinced the others of this? That Peeta’s tongue would have fargreater power against the Capitol than any physical strength the rest of uscould claim? I don’t know. It still seems like a really long leap for some ofthe tributes. I mean, we’re talking about Johanna Mason here. But what otherexplanation can there be for their decided efforts to keep him alive?“Katniss, got that spile?” Finnick asks, snapping me back to reality. I cut thevine that ties the spile to my belt and hold the metal tube out to him.That’s when I hear the scream. So full of fear and pain it ices my blood. And sofamiliar. I drop the spile, forget where I am or what lies ahead, only know Imust reach her, protect her. I run wildly in the direction of the voice,heedless of danger, ripping through vines and branches, through anything thatkeeps me from reaching her.From reaching my little sister."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00028.jpg]Where is she? What are they doing to her? “Prim!” I cry out. “Prim!” Onlyanother agonized scream answers me. How did she get here? Why is she part of theGames? “Prim!”Vines cut into my face and arms, creepers grab my feet. But I am getting closerto her. Closer. Very close now. Sweat pours down my face, stinging the healingacid wounds. I pant, trying to get some use out of the warm, moist air thatseems empty of oxygen. Prim makes a sound — such a lost, irretrievable sound —that I can’t even imagine what they have done to evoke it.“Prim!” I rip through a wall of green into a small clearing and the soundrepeats directly above me. Above me? My head whips back. Do they have her up inthe trees?I desperately search the branches but see nothing. “Prim?” I saypleadingly. I hear her but can’t see her. Her next wail rings out, clear as abell, and there’s no mistaking the source. It’s coming from the mouth of asmall, crested black bird perched on a branch about ten feet over my head. Andthen I understand.It’s a jabberjay.I’ve never seen one before — I thought they no longer existed — and for amoment, as I lean against the trunk of the tree, clutching the stitch in myside, I examine it. The muttation, the forerunner, the father. I pull up amental image of a mockingbird, fuse it with the jabberjay, and yes, I can seehow they mated to make my mockingjay. There is nothing about the bird thatsuggests it’s a mutt. Nothing except the horribly lifelike sounds of Prim’svoice streaming from its mouth. I silence it with an arrow in its throat. Thebird falls to the ground. I remove my arrow and wring its neck for good measure.Then I hurl the revolting thing into the jungle. No degree of hunger would evertempt me to eat it.It wasn’t real, I tell myself. The same way the muttation wolves last yearweren’t really the dead tributes. It’s just a sadistic trick of the Gamemakers.Finnick crashes into the clearing to find me wiping my arrow clean with somemoss. “Katniss?”“It’s okay. I’m okay,” I say, although I don’t feel okay at all. “I thought Iheard my sister but —” The piercing shriek cuts me off. It’s another voice, notPrim’s, maybe a young woman’s. I don’t recognize it. But the effect on Finnickis instantaneous. The color vanishes from his face and I can actually see hispupils dilate in fear. “Finnick, wait!” I say, reaching out to reassure him, buthe’s bolted away. Gone off in pursuit of the victim, as mindlessly as I pursuedPrim. “Finnick!” I call, but I know he won’t turn back and wait for me to give arational explanation. So all I can do is follow him.It’s no effort to track him, even though he’s moving so fast, since he leaves aclear, trampled path in his wake. But the bird is at least a quarter mile away,most of it uphill, and by the time I reach him, I’m winded. He’s circling arounda giant tree. The trunk must be four feet in diameter and the limbs don’t evenbegin until twenty feet up. The woman’s shrieks emanate from somewhere in thefoliage, but the jabberjay’s concealed. Finnick’s screaming as well, over andover. “Annie! Annie!” He’s in a state of panic and completely unreachable, so Ido what I would do anyway. I scale an adjacent tree, locate the jabberjay, andtake it out with an arrow. It falls straight down, landing right at Finnick’sfeet. He picks it up, slowly making the connection, but when I slide down tojoin him, he looks more despairing than ever.“It’s all right, Finnick. It’s just a jabberjay. They’re playing a trick on us,”I say. “It’s not real. It’s not your . . . Annie.”“No, it’s not Annie. But the voice was hers. Jabberjays mimic what they hear.Where did they get those screams, Katniss?” he says.I can feel my own cheeks grow pale as I understand his meaning. “Oh, Finnick,you don’t think they . . .”“Yes. I do. That’s exactly what I think,” he says.I have an image of Prim in a white room, strapped to a table, while masked,robed figures elicit those sounds from her. Somewhere they are torturing her, ordid torture her, to get those sounds. My knees turn to water and I sink to theground. Finnick is trying to tell me something, but I can’t hear him. What I dofinally hear is another bird starting up somewhere off to my left. And thistime, the voice is Gale’s.Finnick catches my arm before I can run. “No. It’s not him.” He starts pullingme downhill, toward the beach. “We’re getting out of here!” But Gale’s voice isso full of pain I can’t help struggling to reach it. “It’s not him, Katniss!It’s a mutt!” Finnick shouts at me. “Come on!” He moves me along, half dragging,half carrying me, until I can process what he said. He’s right, it’s justanother jabberjay. I can’t help Gale by chasing it down. But that doesn’t changethe fact that it is Gale’s voice, and somewhere, sometime, someone has made himsound like this.I stop fighting Finnick, though, and like the night in the fog, I flee what Ican’t fight. What can only do me harm. Only this time it’s my heart and not mybody that’s disintegrating. This must be another weapon of the clock. Fouro’clock, I guess. When the hands tick-tock onto the four, the monkeys go homeand the jabberjays come out to play. Finnick is right — getting out of here isthe only thing to do. Although there will be nothing Haymitch can send in aparachute that will help either Finnick or me recover from the wounds the birdshave inflicted.I catch sight of Peeta and Johanna standing at the tree line and I’m filled witha mixture of relief and anger. Why didn’t Peeta come to help me? Why did no onecome after us? Even now he hangs back, his hands raised, palms toward us, lipsmoving but no words reaching us. Why?The wall is so transparent, Finnick and I run smack into it and bounce back ontothe jungle floor. I’m lucky. My shoulder took the worst of the impact, whereasFinnick hit face-first and now his nose is gushing blood. This is why Peeta andJohanna and even Beetee, who I see sadly shaking his head behind them, have notcome to our aid. An invisible barrier blocks the area in front of us. It’s not aforce field. You can touch the hard, smooth surface all you like. But Peeta’sknife and Johanna’s ax can’t make a dent in it. I know, without checking morethan a few feet to one side, that it encloses the entire four-to-five-o’clockwedge. That we will be trapped like rats until the hour passes.Peeta presses his hand against the surface and I put my own up to meet it, as ifI can feel him through the wall. I see his lips moving but I can’t hear him,can’t hear anything outside our wedge. I try to make out what he’s saying, but Ican’t focus, so I just stare at his face, doing my best to hang on to my sanity.Then the birds begin to arrive. One by one. Perching in the surroundingbranches. And a carefully orchestrated chorus of horror begins to spill out oftheir mouths. Finnick gives up at once, hunching on the ground, clenching hishands over his ears as if he’s trying to crush his skull. I try to fight for awhile. Emptying my quiver of arrows into the hated birds. But every time onedrops dead, another quickly takes its place. And finally I give up and curl upbeside Finnick, trying to block out the excruciating sounds of Prim, Gale, mymother, Madge, Rory, Vick, even Posy, helpless little Posy. . . .I know it’s stopped when I feel Peeta’s hands on me, feel myself lifted from theground and out of the jungle. But I stay eyes squeezed shut, hands over my ears,muscles too rigid to release. Peeta holds me on his lap, speaking soothingwords, rocking me gently. It takes a long time before I begin to relax the irongrip on my body. And when I do, the trembling begins.“It’s all right, Katniss,” he whispers.“You didn’t hear them,” I answer.“I heard Prim. Right in the beginning. But it wasn’t her,” he says. “It was ajabberjay.”“It was her. Somewhere. The jabberjay just recorded it,” I say.“No, that’s what they want you to think. The same way I wondered if Glimmer’seyes were in that mutt last year. But those weren’t Glimmer’s eyes. And thatwasn’t Prim’s voice. Or if it was, they took it from an interview or somethingand distorted the sound. Made it say whatever she was saying,” he says.“No, they were torturing her,” I answer. “She’s probably dead.”“Katniss, Prim isn’t dead. How could they kill Prim? We’re almost down to thefinal eight of us. And what happens then?” Peeta says.“Seven more of us die,” I say hopelessly.“No, back home. What happens when they reach the final eight tributes in theGames?” He lifts my chin so I have to look at him. Forces me to make eyecontact. “What happens? At the final eight?”I know he’s trying to help me, so I make myself think. “At the final eight?” Irepeat. “They interview your family and friends back home.”“That’s right,” says Peeta. “They interview your family and friends. And canthey do that if they’ve killed them all?”“No?” I ask, still unsure.“No. That’s how we know Prim’s alive. She’ll be the first one they interview,won’t she?” he asks.I want to believe him. Badly. It’s just . . . those voices . . .“First Prim. Then your mother. Your cousin, Gale. Madge,” he continues. “It wasa trick, Katniss. A horrible one. But we’re the only ones who can be hurt by it.We’re the ones in the Games. Not them.”“You really believe that?” I say.“I really do,” says Peeta. I waver, thinking of how Peeta can make anyonebelieve anything. I look over at Finnick for confirmation, see he’s fixated onPeeta, his words.“Do you believe it, Finnick?” I ask.“It could be true. I don’t know,” he says. “Could they do that, Beetee? Takesomeone’s regular voice and make it . . .”“Oh, yes. It’s not even that difficult, Finnick. Our children learn a similartechnique in school,” says Beetee.“Of course Peeta’s right. The whole country adores Katniss’s little sister. Ifthey really killed her like this, they’d probably have an uprising on theirhands,” says Johanna flatly. “Don’t want that, do they?” She throws back herhead and shouts, “Whole country in rebellion? Wouldn’t want anything like that!”My mouth drops open in shock. No one, ever, says anything like this in theGames. Absolutely, they’ve cut away from Johanna, are editing her out. But Ihave heard her and can never think about her again in the same way. She’ll neverwin any awards for kindness, but she certainly is gutsy. Or crazy. She picks upsome shells and heads toward the jungle. “I’m getting water,” she says.I can’t help catching her hand as she passes me. “Don’t go in there. The birds—” I remember the birds must be gone, but I still don’t want anyone in there.Not even her.“They can’t hurt me. I’m not like the rest of you. There’s no one left I love,”Johanna says, and frees her hand with an impatient shake. When she brings meback a shell of water, I take it with a silent nod of thanks, knowing how muchshe would despise the pity in my voice.While Johanna collects water and my arrows, Beetee fiddles with his wire, andFinnick takes to the water. I need to clean up, too, but I stay in Peeta’s arms,still too shaken to move.“Who did they use against Finnick?” he asks.“Somebody named Annie,” I say.“Must be Annie Cresta,” he says.“Who?” I ask.“Annie Cresta. She was the girl Mags volunteered for. She won about five yearsago,” says Peeta.That would have been the summer after my father died, when I first began feedingmy family, when my whole being was occupied with battling starvation. “I don’tremember those Games much,” I say. “Was that the earthquake year?”“Yeah. Annie’s the one who went mad when her district partner got beheaded. Ranoff by herself and hid. But an earthquake broke a dam and most of the arena gotflooded. She won because she was the best swimmer,” says Peeta.“Did she get better after?” I ask. “I mean, her mind?”“I don’t know. I don’t remember ever seeing her at the Games again. But shedidn’t look too stable during the reaping this year,” says Peeta.So that’s who Finnick loves, I think. Not his string of fancy lovers in theCapitol. But a poor, mad girl back home.A cannon blast brings us all together on the beach. A hovercraft appears in whatwe estimate to be the six-to-seven-o’clock zone. We watch as the claw dips downfive different times to retrieve the pieces of one body, torn apart. It’simpossible to tell who it was. Whatever happens at six o’clock, I never want toknow.Peeta draws a new map on a leaf, adding a JJ for jabber-jays in thefour-to-five-o’clock section and simply writing beast in the one where we sawthe tribute collected in pieces. We now have a good idea of what seven of thehours will bring. And if there’s any positive to the jabberjay attack, it’s thatit let us know where we are on the clock face again.Finnick weaves yet another water basket and a net for fishing. I take a quickswim and put more ointment on my skin. Then I sit at the edge of the water,cleaning the fish Finnick catches and watching the sun drop below the horizon.The bright moon is already on the rise, filling the arena with that strangetwilight. We’re about to settle down to our meal of raw fish when the anthembegins. And then the faces . . .Cashmere. Gloss. Wiress. Mags. The woman from District 5. The morphling who gaveher life for Peeta. Blight. The man from 10.Eight dead. Plus eight from the first night. Two-thirds of us gone in a day anda half. That must be some kind of record.“They’re really burning through us,” says Johanna.“Who’s left? Besides us five and District Two?” asks Finnick.“Chaff,” says Peeta, without needing to think about it. Perhaps he’s beenkeeping an eye out for him because of Haymitch.A parachute comes down with a pile of bite-sized square-shaped rolls. “These arefrom your district, right, Beetee?” Peeta asks.“Yes, from District Three,” he says. “How many are there?”Finnick counts them, turning each one over in his hands before he sets it in aneat configuration. I don’t know what it is with Finnick and bread, but he seemsobsessed with handling it. “Twenty-four,” he says.“An even two dozen, then?” says Beetee.“Twenty-four on the nose,” says Finnick. “How should we divide them?”“Let’s each have three, and whoever is still alive at breakfast can take a voteon the rest,” says Johanna. I don’t know why this makes me laugh a little. Iguess because it’s true. When I do, Johanna gives me a look that’s almostapproving. No, not approving. But maybe slightly pleased.We wait until the giant wave has flooded out of the ten-to-eleven-o’clocksection, wait for the water to recede, and then go to that beach to make camp.Theoretically, we should have a full twelve hours of safety from the jungle.There’s an unpleasant chorus of clicking, probably from some evil type ofinsect, coming from the eleven-to-twelve-o’clock wedge. But whatever is makingthe sound stays within the confines of the jungle and we keep off that part ofthe beach in case they’re just waiting for a carelessly placed footfall to swarmout.I don’t know how Johanna’s still on her feet. She’s only had about an hour ofsleep since the Games started. Peeta and I volunteer for the first watch becausewe’re better rested, and because we want some time alone. The others go outimmediately, although Finnick’s sleep is restless. Every now and then I hear himmurmuring Annie’s name.Peeta and I sit on the damp sand, facing away from each other, my right shoulderand hip pressed against his. I watch the water as he watches the jungle, whichis better for me. I’m still haunted by the voices of the jabberjays, whichunfortunately the insects can’t drown out. After a while I rest my head againsthis shoulder. Feel his hand caress my hair.“Katniss,” he says softly, “it’s no use pretending we don’t know what the otherone is trying to do.” No, I guess there isn’t, but it’s no fun discussing it,either. Well, not for us, anyway. The Capitol viewers will be glued to theirsets so they don’t miss one wretched word.“I don’t know what kind of deal you think you’ve made with Haymitch, but youshould know he made me promises as well.” Of course, I know this, too. He toldPeeta they could keep me alive so that he wouldn’t be suspicious. “So I think wecan assume he was lying to one of us.”This gets my attention. A double deal. A double promise. With only Haymitchknowing which one is real. I raise my head, meet Peeta’s eyes. “Why are yousaying this now?”“Because I don’t want you forgetting how different our circumstances are. If youdie, and I live, there’s no life for me at all back in District Twelve. You’remy whole life,” he says. “I would never be happy again.” I start to object buthe puts a finger to my lips. “It’s different for you. I’m not saying it wouldn’tbe hard. But there are other people who’d make your life worth living.”Peeta pulls the chain with the gold disk from around his neck. He holds it inthe moonlight so I can clearly see the mockingjay. Then his thumb slides along acatch I didn’t notice before and the disk pops open. It’s not solid, as I hadthought, but a locket. And within the locket are photos. On the right side, mymother and Prim, laughing. And on the left, Gale. Actually smiling.There is nothing in the world that could break me faster at this moment thanthese three faces. After what I heard this afternoon . . . it is the perfectweapon.“Your family needs you, Katniss,” Peeta says.My family. My mother. My sister. And my pretend cousin Gale. But Peeta’sintention is clear. That Gale really is my family, or will be one day, if Ilive. That I’ll marry him. So Peeta’s giving me his life and Gale at the sametime. To let me know I shouldn’t ever have doubts about it. Everything. That’swhat Peeta wants me to take from him.I wait for him to mention the baby, to play to the cameras, but he doesn’t. Andthat’s how I know that none of this is part of the Games. That he is telling methe truth about what he feels.“No one really needs me,” he says, and there’s no self-pity in his voice. It’strue his family doesn’t need him. They will mourn him, as will a handful offriends. But they will get on. Even Haymitch, with the help of a lot of whiteliquor, will get on. I realize only one person will be damaged beyond repair ifPeeta dies. Me.“I do,” I say. “I need you.” He looks upset, takes a deep breath as if to begina long argument, and that’s no good, no good at all, because he’ll start goingon about Prim and my mother and everything and I’ll just get confused. So beforehe can talk, I stop his lips with a kiss.I feel that thing again. The thing I only felt once before. In the cave lastyear, when I was trying to get Haymitch to send us food. I kissed Peeta about athousand times during those Games and after. But there was only one kiss thatmade me feel something stir deep inside. Only one that made me want more. But myhead wound started bleeding and he made me lie down.This time, there is nothing but us to interrupt us. And after a few attempts,Peeta gives up on talking. The sensation inside me grows warmer and spreads outfrom my chest, down through my body, out along my arms and legs, to the tips ofmy being. Instead of satisfying me, the kisses have the opposite effect, ofmaking my need greater. I thought I was something of an expert on hunger, butthis is an entirely new kind.It’s the first crack of the lightning storm — the bolt hitting the tree atmidnight — that brings us to our senses. It rouses Finnick as well. He sits upwith a sharp cry. I see his fingers digging into the sand as he reassureshimself that whatever nightmare he inhabited wasn’t real.“I can’t sleep anymore,” he says. “One of you should rest.” Only then does heseem to notice our expressions, the way we’re wrapped around each other. “Orboth of you. I can watch alone.”Peeta won’t let him, though. “It’s too dangerous,” he says. “I’m not tired. Youlie down, Katniss.” I don’t object because I do need to sleep if I’m to be ofany use keeping him alive. I let him lead me over to where the others are. Heputs the chain with the locket around my neck, then rests his hand over the spotwhere our baby would be. “You’re going to make a great mother, you know,” hesays. He kisses me one last time and goes back to Finnick.His reference to the baby signals that our time-out from the Games is over. Thathe knows the audience will be wondering why he hasn’t used the most persuasiveargument in his arsenal. That sponsors must be manipulated.But as I stretch out on the sand I wonder, could it be more? Like a reminder tome that I could still one day have kids with Gale? Well, if that was it, it wasa mistake. Because for one thing, that’s never been part of my plan. And foranother, if only one of us can be a parent, anyone can see it should be Peeta.As I drift off, I try to imagine that world, somewhere in the future, with noGames, no Capitol. A place like the meadow in the song I sang to Rue as shedied. Where Peeta’s child could be safe."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00013.jpg]When I wake, I have a brief, delicious feeling of happiness that is somehowconnected with Peeta. Happiness, of course, is a complete absurdity at thispoint, since at the rate things are going, I’ll be dead in a day. And that’s thebest-case scenario, if I’m able to eliminate the rest of the field, includingmyself, and get Peeta crowned as the winner of the Quarter Quell. Still, thesensation’s so unexpected and sweet I cling to it, if only for a few moments.Before the gritty sand, the hot sun, and my itching skin demand a return toreality.Everyone’s already up and watching the descent of a parachute to the beach. Ijoin them for another delivery of bread. It’s identical to the one we receivedthe night before. Twenty-four rolls from District 3. That gives us thirty-threein all. We each take five, leaving eight in reserve. No one says it, but eightwill divide up perfectly after the next death. Somehow, in the light of day,joking about who will be around to eat the rolls has lost its humor.How long can we keep this alliance? I don’t think anyone expected the number oftributes to drop so quickly. What if I am wrong about the others protectingPeeta? If things were simply coincidental, or it’s all been a strategy to winour trust to make us easy prey, or I don’t understand what’s actually going on?Wait, there’s no ifs about that. I don’t understand what’s going on. And if Idon’t, it’s time for Peeta and me to clear out of here.I sit next to Peeta on the sand to eat my rolls. For some reason, it’s difficultto look at him. Maybe it was all that kissing last night, although the two of uskissing isn’t anything new. It might not even have felt any different for him.Maybe it’s knowing the brief amount of time we have left. And how we’re workingat such cross-purposes when it comes to who should survive these Games.After we eat, I take his hand and tug him toward the water. “Come on. I’ll teachyou how to swim.” I need to get him away from the others where we can discussbreaking away. It will be tricky, because once they realize we’re severing thealliance, we’ll be instant targets.If I was really teaching him to swim, I’d make him take off the belt since itkeeps him afloat, but what does it matter now? So I just show him the basicstroke and let him practice going back and forth in waist-high water. At first,I notice Johanna keeping a careful eye on us, but eventually she loses interestand goes to take a nap. Finnick’s weaving a new net out of vines and Beeteeplays with his wire. I know the time has come.While Peeta has been swimming, I’ve discovered something. My remaining scabs arestarting to peel off. By gently rubbing a handful of sand up and down my arm, Iclean off the rest of the scales, revealing fresh new skin underneath. I stopPeeta’s practice, on the pretext of showing him how to rid himself of the itchyscabs, and as we scrub ourselves, I bring up our escape.“Look, the pool is down to eight. I think it’s time we took off,” I say under mybreath, although I doubt any of the tributes can hear me.Peeta nods, and I can see him considering my proposition. Weighing if the oddswill be in our favor. “Tell you what,” he says. “Let’s stick around until Brutusand Enobaria are dead. I think Beetee’s trying to put together some kind of trapfor them now. Then, I promise, we’ll go.”I’m not entirely convinced. But if we leave now, we’ll have two sets ofadversaries after us. Maybe three, because who knows what Chaff’s up to? Plusthe clock to contend with. And then there’s Beetee to think of. Johanna onlybrought him for me, and if we leave she’ll surely kill him. Then I remember. Ican’t protect Beetee, too. There can only be one victor and it has to be Peeta.I must accept this. I must make decisions based on his survival only.“All right,” I say. “We’ll stay until the Careers are dead. But that’s the endof it.” I turn and wave to Finnick. “Hey, Finnick, come on in! We figured outhow to make you pretty again!”The three of us scour all the scabs from our bodies, helping with the others’backs, and come out the same pink as the sky. We apply another round of medicinebecause the skin seems too delicate for the sunlight, but it doesn’t look halfas bad on smooth skin and will be good camouflage in the jungle.Beetee calls us over, and it turns out that during all those hours of fiddlingwith wire, he has indeed come up with a plan. “I think we’ll all agree our nextjob is to kill Brutus and Enobaria,” he says mildly. “I doubt they’ll attack usopenly again, now that they’re so outnumbered. We could track them down, Isuppose, but it’s dangerous, exhausting work.”“Do you think they’ve figured out about the clock?” I ask.“If they haven’t, they’ll figure it out soon enough. Perhaps not as specificallyas we have. But they must know that at least some of the zones are wired forattacks and that they’re reoccurring in a circular fashion. Also, the fact thatour last fight was cut off by Gamemaker intervention will not have goneunnoticed by them. We know it was an attempt to disorient us, but they must beasking themselves why it was done, and this, too, may lead them to therealization that the arena’s a clock,” says Beetee. “So I think our best betwill be setting our own trap.”“Wait, let me get Johanna up,” says Finnick. “She’ll be rabid if she thinks shemissed something this important.”“Or not,” I mutter, since she’s always pretty much rabid, but I don’t stop him,because I’d be angry myself if I was excluded from a plan at this point.When she’s joined us, Beetee shoos us all back a bit so he can have room to workin the sand. He swiftly draws a circle and divides it into twelve wedges. It’sthe arena, not rendered in Peeta’s precise strokes but in the rough lines of aman whose mind is occupied by other, far more complex things. “If you wereBrutus and Enobaria, knowing what you do now about the jungle, where would youfeel safest?” Beetee asks. There’s nothing patronizing in his voice, and yet Ican’t help thinking he reminds me of a schoolteacher about to ease children intoa lesson. Perhaps it’s the age difference, or simply that Beetee is probablyabout a million times smarter than the rest of us.“Where we are now. On the beach,” says Peeta. “It’s the safest place.”“So why aren’t they on the beach?” says Beetee.“Because we’re here,” says Johanna impatiently.“Exactly. We’re here, claiming the beach. Now where would you go?” says Beetee.I think about the deadly jungle, the occupied beach. “I’d hide just at the edgeof the jungle. So I could escape if an attack came. And so I could spy on us.”“Also to eat,” Finnick says. “The jungle’s full of strange creatures and plants.But by watching us, I’d know the seafood’s safe.”Beetee smiles at us as if we’ve exceeded his expectations. “Yes, good. You dosee. Now here’s what I propose: a twelve o’clock strike. What happens exactly atnoon and at midnight?”“The lightning bolt hits the tree,” I say.“Yes. So what I’m suggesting is that after the bolt hits at noon, but before ithits at midnight, we run my wire from that tree all the way down into thesaltwater, which is, of course, highly conductive. When the bolt strikes, theelectricity will travel down the wire and into not only the water but also thesurrounding beach, which will still be damp from the ten o’clock wave. Anyone incontact with those surfaces at that moment will be electrocuted,” says Beetee.There’s a long pause while we all digest Beetee’s plan. It seems a bitfantastical to me, impossible even. But why? I’ve set thousands of snares. Isn’tthis just a larger snare with a more scientific component? Could it work? Howcan we even question it, we tributes trained to gather fish and lumber and coal?What do we know about harnessing power from the sky?Peeta takes a stab at it. “Will that wire really be able to conduct that muchpower, Beetee? It looks so fragile, like it would just burn up.”“Oh, it will. But not until the current has passed through it. It will actsomething like a fuse, in fact. Except the electricity will travel along it,”says Beetee.“How do you know?” asks Johanna, clearly not convinced.“Because I invented it,” says Beetee, as if slightly surprised. “It’s notactually wire in the usual sense. Nor is the lightning natural lightning nor thetree a real tree. You know trees better than any of us, Johanna. It would bedestroyed by now, wouldn’t it?”“Yes,” she says glumly.“Don’t worry about the wire — it will do just what I say,” Beetee assures us.“And where will we be when this happens?” asks Finnick.“Far enough up in the jungle to be safe,” Beetee replies.“The Careers will be safe, too, then, unless they’re in the vicinity of thewater,” I point out.“That’s right,” says Beetee.“But all the seafood will be cooked,” says Peeta.“Probably more than cooked,” says Beetee. “We will most likely be eliminatingthat as a food source for good. But you found other edible things in the jungle,right, Katniss?”“Yes. Nuts and rats,” I say. “And we have sponsors.”“Well, then. I don’t see that as a problem,” says Beetee. “But as we are alliesand this will require all our efforts, the decision of whether or not to attemptit is up to you four.”We are like schoolchildren. Completely unable to dispute his theory withanything but the most elementary concerns. Most of which don’t even haveanything to do with his actual plan. I look at the others’ disconcerted faces.“Why not?” I say. “If it fails, there’s no harm done. If it works, there’s adecent chance we’ll kill them. And even if we don’t and just kill the seafood,Brutus and Enobaria lose it as a food source, too.”“I say we try it,” says Peeta. “Katniss is right.”Finnick looks at Johanna and raises his eyebrows. He will not go forward withouther. “All right,” she says finally. “It’s better than hunting them down in thejungle, anyway. And I doubt they’ll figure out our plan, since we can barelyunderstand it ourselves.”Beetee wants to inspect the lightning tree before he has to rig it. Judging bythe sun, it’s about nine in the morning. We have to leave our beach soon,anyway. So we break camp, walk over to the beach that borders the lightningsection, and head into the jungle. Beetee’s still too weak to hike up the slopeon his own, so Finnick and Peeta take turns carrying him. I let Johanna leadbecause it’s a pretty straight shot up to the tree, and I figure she can’t getus too lost. Besides, I can do a lot more damage with a sheath of arrows thanshe can with two axes, so I’m the best one to bring up the rear.The dense, muggy air weighs on me. There’s been no break from it since the Gamesbegan. I wish Haymitch would stop sending us that District 3 bread and get ussome more of that District 4 stuff, because I’ve sweated out buckets in the lasttwo days, and even though I’ve had the fish, I’m craving salt. A piece of icewould be another good idea. Or a cold drink of water. I’m grateful for the fluidfrom the trees, but it’s the same temperature as the seawater and the air andthe other tributes and me. We’re all just one big, warm stew.As we near the tree, Finnick suggests I take the lead. “Katniss can hear theforce field,” he explains to Beetee and Johanna.“Hear it?” asks Beetee.“Only with the ear the Capitol reconstructed,” I say. Guess who I’m not foolingwith that story? Beetee. Because surely he remembers that he showed me how tospot a force field, and probably it’s impossible to hear force fields, anyway.But, for whatever reason, he doesn’t question my claim.“Then by all means, let Katniss go first,” he says, pausing a moment to wipe thesteam off his glasses. “Force fields are nothing to play around with.”The lightning tree’s unmistakable as it towers so high above the others. I finda bunch of nuts and make everybody wait while I move slowly up the slope,tossing the nuts ahead of me. But I see the force field almost immediately, evenbefore a nut hits it, because it’s only about fifteen yards away. My eyes, whichare sweeping the greenery before me, catch sight of the rippled square high upand to my right. I throw a nut directly in front of me and hear it sizzle inconfirmation.“Just stay below the lightning tree,” I tell the others.We divide up duties. Finnick guards Beetee while he examines the tree, Johannataps for water, Peeta gathers nuts, and I hunt nearby. The tree rats don’t seemto have any fear of humans, so I take down three easily. The sound of the teno’clock wave reminds me I should get back, and I return to the others and cleanmy kill. Then I draw a line in the dirt a few feet from the force field as areminder to keep back, and Peeta and I settle down to roast nuts and sear cubesof rat.Beetee is still messing around the tree, doing I don’t know what, takingmeasurements and such. At one point he snaps off a sliver of bark, joins us, andthrows it against the force field. It bounces back and lands on the ground,glowing. In a few moments it returns to its original color. “Well, that explainsa lot,” says Beetee. I look at Peeta and can’t help biting my lip to keep fromlaughing since it explains absolutely nothing to anyone but Beetee.About this time we hear the sound of clicks rising from the sector adjacent tous. That means it’s eleven o’clock. It’s far louder in the jungle than it was onthe beach last night. We all listen intently.“It’s not mechanical,” Beetee says decidedly.“I’d guess insects,” I say. “Maybe beetles.”“Something with pincers,” adds Finnick.The sound swells, as if alerted by our quiet words to the proximity of liveflesh. Whatever is making that clicking, I bet it could strip us to the bone inseconds.“We should get out of here, anyway,” says Johanna. “There’s less than an hourbefore the lightning starts.”We don’t go that far, though. Only to the identical tree in the blood-rainsection. We have a picnic of sorts, squatting on the ground, eating our junglefood, waiting for the bolt that signals noon. At Beetee’s request, I climb upinto the canopy as the clicking begins to fade out. When the lightning strikes,it’s dazzling, even from here, even in this bright sunlight. It completelyencompasses the distant tree, making it glow a hot blue-white and causing thesurrounding air to crackle with electricity. I swing down and report my findingsto Beetee, who seems satisfied, even if I’m not terribly scientific.We take a circuitous route back to the ten o’clock beach. The sand is smooth anddamp, swept clean by the recent wave. Beetee essentially gives us the afternoonoff while he works with the wire. Since it’s his weapon and the rest of us haveto defer to his knowledge so entirely, there’s the odd feeling of being let outof school early. At first we take turns having naps in the shadowy edge of thejungle, but by late afternoon everyone is awake and restless. We decide, sincethis might be our last chance for seafood, to make a sort of feast of it. UnderFinnick’s guidance we spear fish and gather shellfish, even dive for oysters. Ilike this last part best, not because I have any great appetite for oysters. Ionly ever tasted them once, in the Capitol, and I couldn’t get around thesliminess. But it’s lovely, deep down under the water, like being in a differentworld. The water’s very clear, and schools of bright-hued fish and strange seaflowers decorate the sand floor.Johanna keeps watch while Finnick, Peeta, and I clean and lay out the seafood.Peeta’s just pried open an oyster when I hear him give a laugh. “Hey, look atthis!” He holds up a glistening, perfect pearl about the size of a pea. “Youknow, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls,” he says earnestlyto Finnick.“No, it doesn’t,” says Finnick dismissively. But I crack up, remembering that’show a clueless Effie Trinket presented us to the people of the Capitol lastyear, before anyone knew us. As coal pressured into pearls by our weightyexistence. Beauty that arose out of pain.Peeta rinses the pearl off in the water and hands it to me. “For you.” I hold itout on my palm and examine its iridescent surface in the sunlight. Yes, I willkeep it. For the few remaining hours of my life I will keep it close. This lastgift from Peeta. The only one I can really accept. Perhaps it will give mestrength in the final moments.“Thanks,” I say, closing my fist around it. I look coolly into the blue eyes ofthe person who is now my greatest opponent, the person who would keep me aliveat his own expense. And I promise myself I will defeat his plan.The laughter drains from those eyes, and they are staring so intensely intomine, it’s like they can read my thoughts. “The locket didn’t work, did it?”Peeta says, even though Finnick is right there. Even though everyone can hearhim. “Katniss?”“It worked,” I say.“But not the way I wanted it to,” he says, averting his glance. After that hewill look at nothing but oysters.Just as we’re about to eat, a parachute appears bearing two supplements to ourmeal. A small pot of spicy red sauce and yet another round of rolls fromDistrict 3. Finnick, of course, immediately counts them. “Twenty-four again,” hesays.Thirty-two rolls, then. So we each take five, leaving seven, which will neverdivide equally. It’s bread for only one.The salty fish flesh, the succulent shellfish. Even the oysters seem tasty,vastly improved by the sauce. We gorge ourselves until no one can hold anotherbite, and even then there are leftovers. They won’t keep, though, so we toss allthe remaining food back into the water so the Careers won’t get it when weleave. No one bothers about the shells. The wave should clear those away.There’s nothing to do now but wait. Peeta and I sit at the edge of the water,hand in hand, wordless. He gave his speech last night but it didn’t change mymind, and nothing I can say will change his. The time for persuasive gifts isover.I have the pearl, though, secured in a parachute with the spile and the medicineat my waist. I hope it makes it back to District 12.Surely my mother and Prim will know to return it to Peeta before they bury mybody."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00030.jpg]The anthem begins, but there are no faces in the sky tonight. The audience willbe restless, thirsting for blood. Beetee’s trap holds enough promise, though,that the Gamemakers haven’t sent in other attacks. Perhaps they are simplycurious to see if it will work.At what Finnick and I judge to be about nine, we leave our shell-strewn camp,cross to the twelve o’clock beach, and begin to quietly hike up to the lightningtree in the light of the moon. Our full stomachs make us more uncomfortable andbreathless than we were on the morning’s climb. I begin to regret those lastdozen oysters.Beetee asks Finnick to assist him, and the rest of us stand guard. Before heeven attaches any wire to the tree, Beetee unrolls yards and yards of the stuff.He has Finnick secure it tightly around a broken branch and lay it on theground. Then they stand on either side of the tree, passing the spool back andforth as they wrap the wire around and around the trunk. At first it seemsarbitrary, then I see a pattern, like an intricate maze, appearing in themoonlight on Beetee’s side. I wonder if it makes any difference how the wire’splaced, or if this is merely to add to the speculation of the audience. I betmost of them know as much about electricity as I do.The work on the trunk’s completed just as we hear the wave begin. I’ve neverreally worked out at what point in the ten o’clock hour it erupts. There must besome buildup, then the wave itself, then the aftermath of the flooding. But thesky tells me ten-thirty.This is when Beetee reveals the rest of the plan. Since we move most swiftlythrough the trees, he wants Johanna and me to take the coil down through thejungle, unwinding the wire as we go. We are to lay it across the twelve o’clockbeach and drop the metal spool, with whatever is left, deep into the water,making sure it sinks. Then run for the jungle. If we go now, right now, weshould make it to safety.“I want to go with them as a guard,” Peeta says immediately. After the momentwith the pearl, I know he’s less willing than ever to let me out of his sight.“You’re too slow. Besides, I’ll need you on this end. Katniss will guard,” saysBeetee. “There’s no time to debate this. I’m sorry. If the girls are to get outof there alive, they need to move now.” He hands the coil to Johanna.I don’t like the plan any more than Peeta does. How can I protect him at adistance? But Beetee’s right. With his leg, Peeta is too slow to make it downthe slope in time. Johanna and I are the fastest and most sure-footed on thejungle floor. I can’t think of any alternative. And if I trust anyone herebesides Peeta, it’s Beetee.“It’s okay,” I tell Peeta. “We’ll just drop the coil and come straight back up.”“Not into the lightning zone,” Beetee reminds me. “Head for the tree in theone-to-two-o’clock sector. If you find you’re running out of time, move over onemore. Don’t even think about going back on the beach, though, until I can assessthe damage.”I take Peeta’s face in my hands. “Don’t worry. I’ll see you at midnight.” I givehim a kiss and, before he can object any further, I let go and turn to Johanna.“Ready?”“Why not?” says Johanna with a shrug. She’s clearly no happier about beingteamed up than I am. But we’re all caught up in Beetee’s trap. “You guard, I’llunwind. We can trade off later.”Without further discussion, we head down the slope. In fact there’s very littlediscussion between us at all. We move at a pretty good clip, one manning thecoil, the other keeping watch. About halfway down, we hear the clickingbeginning to rise, indicating it’s after eleven.“Better hurry,” Johanna says. “I want to put a lot of distance between me andthat water before the lightning hits. Just in case Volts miscalculatedsomething.”“I’ll take the coil for a while,” I say. It’s harder work laying out the wirethan guarding, and she’s had a long turn.“Here,” Johanna says, passing me the coil.Both of our hands are still on the metal cylinder when there’s a slightvibration. Suddenly the thin golden wire from above springs down at us, bunchingin tangled loops and curls around our wrists. Then the severed end snakes up toour feet.It only takes a second to register this rapid turn of events. Johanna and I lookat each other, but neither of us has to say it. Someone not far above us has cutthe wire. And they will be on us at any moment.My hand frees itself from the wire and has just closed on the feathers of anarrow when the metal cylinder smashes into the side of my head. The next thing Iknow, I’m lying on my back in the vines, a terrible pain in my left temple.Something’s wrong with my eyes. My vision blurs in and out of focus as I strainto make the two moons floating up in the sky into one. It’s hard to breathe, andI realize Johanna’s sitting on my chest, pinning me at the shoulders with herknees.There’s a stab in my left forearm. I try to jerk away but I’m still tooincapacitated. Johanna’s digging something, I guess the point of her knife, intomy flesh, twisting it around. There’s an excruciating ripping sensation andwarmth runs down my wrist, filling my palm. She swipes down my arm and coatshalf my face with my blood.“Stay down!” she hisses. Her weight leaves my body and I’m alone.Stay down? I think. What? What is happening? My eyes shut, blocking out theinconsistent world, as I try to make sense of my situation.All I can think of is Johanna shoving Wiress to the beach. “Just stay down, willyou?” But she didn’t attack Wiress. Not like this. I’m not Wiress, anyway. I’mnot Nuts. “Just stay down, will you?” echoes around inside my brain.Footsteps coming. Two pairs. Heavy, not trying to conceal their whereabouts.Brutus’s voice. “She’s good as dead! Come on, Enobaria!” Feet moving into thenight.Am I? I drift in and out of consciousness looking for an answer. Am I as good asdead? I’m in no position to make an argument to the contrary. In fact, rationalthinking is a struggle. This much I know. Johanna attacked me. Smashed thatcylinder into my head. Cut my arm, probably doing irreparable damage to veinsand arteries, and then Brutus and Enobaria showed up before she had time tofinish me off.The alliance is over. Finnick and Johanna must have had an agreement to turn onus tonight. I knew we should have left this morning. I don’t know where Beeteestands. But I’m fair game, and so is Peeta.Peeta! My eyes fly open in panic. Peeta is waiting up by the tree, unsuspectingand off guard. Maybe Finnick has even killed him already. “No,” I whisper. Thatwire was cut from a short distance away by the Careers. Finnick and Beetee andPeeta — they can’t know what’s going on down here. They can only be wonderingwhat has happened, why the wire has gone slack or maybe even sprung back to thetree. This, in itself, can’t be a signal to kill, can it? Surely this was justJohanna deciding the time had come to break with us. Kill me. Escape from theCareers. Then bring Finnick into the fight as soon as possible.I don’t know. I don’t know. I only know that I must get back to Peeta and keephim alive. It takes every ounce of will I have to push up into a sittingposition and drag myself up the side of a tree to my feet. It’s lucky I havesomething to hold on to because the jungle’s tilting back and forth. Without anywarning, I lean forward and vomit up the seafood feast, heaving until therecan’t possibly be an oyster left in my body. Trembling and slick with sweat, Iassess my physical condition.As I lift up my damaged arm, blood sprays me in the face and the world makesanother alarming shift. I squeeze my eyes shut and cling to the tree untilthings steady a little. Then I take a few careful steps to a neighboring tree,pull off some moss, and without examining the wound further, tightly bandage myarm. Better. Definitely better not to see it. Then I allow my hand totentatively touch my head wound. There’s a huge lump but not too much blood.Obviously I’ve got some internal damage, but I don’t seem in danger of bleedingto death. At least not through my head.I dry my hands on moss and get a shaky grip on my bow with my damaged left arm.Secure the notch of an arrow to the string. Make my feet move up the slope.Peeta. My dying wish. My promise. To keep him alive. My heart lifts a bit when Irealize he must be alive because no cannon has fired. Maybe Johanna was actingalone, knowing Finnick would side with her once her intentions were clear.Although it’s hard to guess what goes on between those two. I think of how helooked to her for confirmation before he’d agree to help set Beetee’s trap.There’s a much deeper alliance based on years of friendship and who knows whatelse. Therefore, if Johanna has turned on me, I should no longer trust Finnick.I reach this conclusion only seconds before I hear someone running down theslope toward me. Neither Peeta nor Beetee could move at this pace. I duck behinda curtain of vines, concealing myself just in time. Finnick flies by me, hisskin shadowy with medicine, leaping through the undergrowth like a deer. He soonreaches the site of my attack, must see the blood. “Johanna! Katniss!” he calls.I stay put until he goes in the direction Johanna and the Careers took.I move as quickly as I can without sending the world into a whirl. My headthrobs with the rapid beat of my heart. The insects, possibly excited by thesmell of blood, have increased their clicking until it’s a continuous roar in myears. No, wait. Maybe my ears are actually ringing from the hit. Until theinsects shut up, it will be impossible to tell. But when the insects go silent,the lightning will start. I have to move faster. I have to get to Peeta.The boom of a cannon pulls me up short. Someone has died. I know that witheveryone running around armed and scared right now, it could be anybody. Butwhoever it is, I believe the death will trigger a kind of free-for-all out herein the night. People will kill first and wonder about their motives later. Iforce my legs into a run.Something snags my feet and I sprawl out on the ground. I feel it wrappingaround me, entwining me in sharp fibers. A net! This must be one of Finnick’sfancy nets, positioned to trap me, and he must be nearby, trident in hand. Iflail around for a moment, only working the web more tightly around me, and thenI catch a glimpse of it in the moonlight. Confused, I lift my arm and see it’sentangled in shimmering golden threads. It’s not one of Finnick’s nets at all,but Beetee’s wire. I carefully rise to my feet and find I’m in a patch of thestuff that caught on a trunk on its way back to the lightning tree. Slowly Idisengage myself from the wire, step out of its reach, and continue uphill.On the good side, I’m on the right path and have not been so disoriented by thehead injury as to lose my sense of direction. On the bad side, the wire hasreminded me of the oncoming lightning storm. I can still hear the insects, butare they starting to fade?I keep the loops of wire a few feet to my left as a guide as I run but takegreat care not to touch them. If those insects are fading and the first bolt isabout to strike the tree, then all its power will come surging down that wireand anyone in contact with it will die.The tree swims into view, its trunk festooned with gold. I slow down, try tomove with some stealth, but I’m really just lucky to be upright. I look for asign of the others. No one. No one is there. “Peeta?” I call softly. “Peeta?”A soft moan answers me and I whip around to find a figure lying higher up on theground. “Beetee!” I exclaim. I hurry and kneel beside him. The moan must havebeen involuntary. He’s not conscious, although I can see no wound except a gashbelow the crook of his elbow. I grab a nearby handful of moss and clumsily wrapit while I try to rouse him. “Beetee! Beetee, what’s going on! Who cut you?Beetee!” I shake him in the way you should never shake an injured person, but Idon’t know what else to do. He moans again and briefly raises a hand to ward meoff.This is when I notice he’s holding a knife, one Peeta was carrying earlier, Ithink, which is wrapped loosely in wire. Perplexed, I stand and lift the wire,confirming it’s attached back at the tree. It takes me a moment to remember thesecond, much shorter strand that Beetee wound around a branch and left on theground before he even began his design on the tree. I’d thought it had someelectrical significance, had been set aside to be used later. But it never was,because there’s probably a good twenty, twenty-five yards here.I squint hard up the hill and realize we’re only a few paces from the forcefield. There’s the telltale square, high up and to my right, just as it was thismorning. What did Beetee do? Did he actually try to drive the knife into theforce field the way Peeta did by accident? And what’s the deal with the wire?Was this his backup plan? If electrifying the water failed, did he mean to sendthe lightning bolt’s energy into the force field? What would that do, anyway?Nothing? A great deal? Fry us all? The force field must mostly be energy, too, Iguess. The one in the Training Center was invisible. This one seems to somehowmirror the jungle. But I’ve seen it falter when Peeta’s knife struck it and whenmy arrows hit. The real world lies right behind it.My ears are not ringing. It was the insects after all. I know that now becausethey are dying out quickly and I hear nothing but the jungle sounds. Beetee isuseless. I can’t rouse him. I can’t save him. I don’t know what he was trying todo with the knife and the wire and he’s incapable of explaining. The mossbandage on my arm is soaked and there’s no use fooling myself. I’m solight-headed I’ll black out in a matter of minutes. I’ve got to get away fromthis tree and —“Katniss!” I hear his voice though he’s a far distance away. But what is hedoing? Peeta must have figured out that everyone is hunting us by now.“Katniss!”I can’t protect him. I can’t move fast or far and my shooting abilities arequestionable at best. I do the one thing I can to draw the attackers away fromhim and over to me. “Peeta!” I scream out. “Peeta! I’m here! Peeta!” Yes, I willdraw them in, any in my vicinity, away from Peeta and over to me and thelightning tree that will soon be a weapon in and of itself. “I’m here! I’mhere!” He won’t make it. Not with that leg in the night. He will never make itin time. “Peeta!”It’s working. I can hear them coming. Two of them. Crashing through the jungle.My knees start to give out and I sink down next to Beetee, resting my weight onmy heels. My bow and arrow lift into position. If I can take them out, willPeeta survive the rest?Enobaria and Finnick reach the lightning tree. They can’t see me, sitting abovethem on the slope, my skin camouflaged in ointment. I home in on Enobaria’sneck. With any luck, when I kill her, Finnick will duck behind the tree forcover just as the lightning bolt strikes. And it will be any second. There’sonly a faint insect click here and there. I can kill them now. I can kill themboth.Another cannon.“Katniss!” Peeta’s voice howls for me. But this time I don’t answer. Beeteestill breathes faintly beside me. He and I will soon die. Finnick and Enobariawill die. Peeta is alive. Two cannons have sounded. Brutus, Johanna, Chaff. Twoof them are already dead. That will leave Peeta with only one tribute to kill.And that is the very best I can do. One enemy.Enemy. Enemy. The word is tugging at a recent memory. Pulling it into thepresent. The look on Haymitch’s face. “Katniss, when you’re in the arena . . .”The scowl, the misgiving. “What?” I hear my own voice tighten as I bristle atsome unspoken accusation. “You just remember who the enemy is,” Haymitch says.“That’s all.”Haymitch’s last words of advice to me. Why would I need reminding? I have alwaysknown who the enemy is. Who starves and tortures and kills us in the arena. Whowill soon kill everyone I love.My bow drops as his meaning registers. Yes, I know who the enemy is. And it’snot Enobaria.I finally see Beetee’s knife with clear eyes. My shaking hands slide the wirefrom the hilt, wind it around the arrow just above the feathers, and secure itwith a knot picked up in training.I rise, turning to the force field, fully revealing myself but no longer caring.Only caring about where I should direct my tip, where Beetee would have driventhe knife if he’d been able to choose. My bow tilts up at the wavering square,the flaw, the . . . what did he call it that day? The chink in the armor. I letthe arrow fly, see it hit its mark and vanish, pulling the thread of gold behindit.My hair stands on end and the lightning strikes the tree.A flash of white runs up the wire, and for just a moment, the dome bursts into adazzling blue light. I’m thrown backward to the ground, body useless, paralyzed,eyes frozen wide, as feathery bits of matter rain down on me. I can’t reachPeeta. I can’t even reach my pearl. My eyes strain to capture one last image ofbeauty to take with me.Right before the explosions begin, I find a star."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/00031.jpg]Everything seems to erupt at once. The earth explodes into showers of dirt andplant matter. Trees burst into flames. Even the sky fills with brightly coloredblossoms of light. I can’t think why the sky’s being bombed until I realize theGamemakers are shooting off fireworks up there, while the real destructionoccurs on the ground. Just in case it’s not enough fun watching the obliterationof the arena and the remaining tributes. Or perhaps to illuminate our gory ends.Will they let anyone survive? Will there be a victor of the Seventy-fifth HungerGames? Maybe not. After all, what is this Quarter Quell but . . . what was itPresident Snow read from the card?“. . . a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannotovercome the power of the Capitol . . .”Not even the strongest of the strong will triumph. Perhaps they never intendedto have a victor in these Games at all. Or perhaps my final act of rebellionforced their hand.I’m sorry, Peeta, I think. I’m sorry I couldn’t save you. Save him? More likelyI stole his last chance at life, condemned him, by destroying the force field.Maybe, if we had all played by the rules, they might have let him live.The hovercraft materializes above me without warning. If it was quiet, and amockingjay perched close at hand, I would have heard the jungle go silent andthen the bird’s call that precedes the appearance of the Capitol’s aircraft. Butmy ears could never make out anything so delicate in this bombardment.The claw drops from the underside until it’s directly overhead. The metal talonsslide under me. I want to scream, run, smash my way out of it but I’m frozen,helpless to do anything but fervently hope I’ll die before I reach the shadowyfigures awaiting me above. They have not spared my life to crown me victor butto make my death as slow and public as possible.My worst fears are confirmed when the face that greets me inside the hovercraftbelongs to Plutarch Heavensbee, Head Gamemaker. What a mess I have made of hisbeautiful Games with the clever ticking clock and the field of victors. He willsuffer for his failure, probably lose his life, but not before he sees mepunished. His hand reaches for me, I think to strike me, but he does somethingworse. With his thumb and his forefinger, he slides my eyelids shut, sentencingme to the vulnerability of darkness. They can do anything to me now and I willnot even see it coming.My heart pounds so hard the blood begins to stream from beneath my soaked mossbandage. My thoughts grow foggy. Possibly I can bleed to death before they canrevive me after all. In my mind, I whisper a thank-you to Johanna Mason for theexcellent wound she inflicted as I black out.When I swim back into semiconsciousness, I can feel I’m lying on a padded table.There’s the pinching sensation of tubes in my left arm. They are trying to keepme alive because, if I slide quietly, privately into death, it will be avictory. I’m still largely unable to move, open my eyelids, raise my head. Butmy right arm has regained a little motion. It flops across my body, feeling likea flipper, no, something less animated, like a club. I have no real motorcoordination, no proof that I even still have fingers. Yet I manage to swing myarm around until I rip the tubes out. A beeping goes off but I can’t stay awaketo find out who it will summon.The next time I surface, my hands are tied down to the table, the tubes back inmy arm. I can open my eyes and lift my head slightly, though. I’m in a largeroom with low ceilings and a silvery light. There are two rows of beds facingeach other. I can hear the breathing of what I assume are my fellow victors.Directly across from me I see Beetee with about ten different machines hooked upto him. Just let us die! I scream in my mind. I slam my head back hard on thetable and go out again.When I finally, truly, wake up, the restraints are gone. I raise my hand andfind I have fingers that can move at my command again. I push myself to asitting position and hold on to the padded table until the room settles intofocus. My left arm is bandaged but the tubes dangle off stands by the bed.I’m alone except for Beetee, who still lies in front of me, being sustained byhis army of machines. Where are the others, then? Peeta, Finnick, Enobaria, and. . . and . . . one more, right? Either Johanna or Chaff or Brutus was stillalive when the bombs began. I’m sure they’ll want to make an example of us all.But where have they taken them? Moved them from hospital to prison?“Peeta . . .” I whisper. I so wanted to protect him. Am still resolved to. SinceI have failed to keep him safe in life, I must find him, kill him now before theCapitol gets to choose the agonizing means of his death. I slide my legs off thetable and look around for a weapon. There are a few syringes sealed in sterileplastic on a table near Beetee’s bed. Perfect. All I’ll need is air and a clearshot at one of his veins.I pause for a moment, consider killing Beetee. But if I do, the monitors willstart beeping and I’ll be caught before I get to Peeta. I make a silent promiseto return and finish him off if I can.I’m naked except for a thin nightgown, so I slip the syringe under the bandagethat covers the wound on my arm. There are no guards at the door. No doubt I’mmiles beneath the Training Center or in some Capitol stronghold, and thepossibility of my escape is nonexistent. It doesn’t matter. I’m not escaping,just finishing a job.I creep down a narrow hallway to a metal door that stands slightly ajar. Someoneis behind it. I take out the syringe and grip it in my hand. Flattening myselfagainst the wall, I listen to the voices inside.“Communications are down in Seven, Ten, and Twelve. But Eleven has control oftransportation now, so there’s at least a hope of them getting some food out.”Plutarch Heavensbee. I think. Although I’ve only really spoken with him once. Ahoarse voice asks a question.“No, I’m sorry. There’s no way I can get you to Four. But I’ve given specialorders for her retrieval if possible. It’s the best I can do, Finnick.”Finnick. My mind struggles to make sense of the conversation, of the fact thatit’s taking place between Plutarch Heavensbee and Finnick. Is he so near anddear to the Capitol that he’ll be excused his crimes? Or did he really have noidea what Beetee intended? He croaks out something else. Something heavy withdespair.“Don’t be stupid. That’s the worst thing you could do. Get her killed for sure.As long as you’re alive, they’ll keep her alive for bait,” says Haymitch.Says Haymitch! I bang through the door and stumble into the room. Haymitch,Plutarch, and a very beat-up Finnick sit around a table laid with a meal no oneis eating. Daylight streams in the curved windows, and in the distance I see thetop of a forest of trees. We are flying.“Done knocking yourself out, sweetheart?” says Haymitch, the annoyance clear inhis voice. But as I careen forward he steps up and catches my wrists, steadyingme. He looks at my hand. “So it’s you and a syringe against the Capitol? See,this is why no one lets you make the plans.” I stare at him uncomprehendingly.“Drop it.” I feel the pressure increase on my right wrist until my hand isforced to open and I release the syringe. He settles me in a chair next toFinnick.Plutarch puts a bowl of broth in front of me. A roll. Slips a spoon into myhand. “Eat,” he says in a much kinder voice than Haymitch used.Haymitch sits directly in front of me. “Katniss, I’m going to explain whathappened. I don’t want you to ask any questions until I’m through. Do youunderstand?”I nod numbly. And this is what he tells me.There was a plan to break us out of the arena from the moment the Quell wasannounced. The victor tributes from 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 11 had varying degrees ofknowledge about it. Plutarch Heavensbee has been, for several years, part of anundercover group aiming to overthrow the Capitol. He made sure the wire wasamong the weapons. Beetee was in charge of blowing a hole in the force field.The bread we received in the arena was code for the time of the rescue. Thedistrict where the bread originated indicated the day. Three. The number ofrolls the hour. Twenty-four. The hovercraft belongs to District 13. Bonnie andTwill, the women I met in the woods from 8, were right about its existence andits defense capabilities. We are currently on a very roundabout journey toDistrict 13. Meanwhile, most of the districts in Panem are in full-scalerebellion.Haymitch stops to see if I am following. Or maybe he is done for the moment.It’s an awful lot to take in, this elaborate plan in which I was a piece, justas I was meant to be a piece in the Hunger Games. Used without consent, withoutknowledge. At least in the Hunger Games, I knew I was being played with.My supposed friends have been a lot more secretive.“You didn’t tell me.” My voice is as ragged as Finnick’s.“Neither you nor Peeta were told. We couldn’t risk it,” says Plutarch. “I waseven worried you might mention my indiscretion with the watch during the Games.”He pulls out his pocket watch and runs his thumb across the crystal, lighting upthe mockingjay. “Of course, when I showed you this, I was merely tipping you offabout the arena. As a mentor. I thought it might be a first step toward gainingyour trust. I never dreamed you’d be a tribute again.”“I still don’t understand why Peeta and I weren’t let in on the plan,” I say.“Because once the force field blew, you’d be the first ones they’d try tocapture, and the less you knew, the better,” says Haymitch.“The first ones? Why?” I say, trying to hang on to the train of thought.“For the same reason the rest of us agreed to die to keep you alive,” saysFinnick.“No, Johanna tried to kill me,” I say.“Johanna knocked you out to cut the tracker from your arm and lead Brutus andEnobaria away from you,” says Haymitch.“What?” My head aches so and I want them to stop talking in circles. “I don’tknow what you’re —”“We had to save you because you’re the mockingjay, Katniss,” says Plutarch.“While you live, the revolution lives.”The bird, the pin, the song, the berries, the watch, the cracker, the dress thatburst into flames. I am the mockingjay. The one that survived despite theCapitol’s plans. The symbol of the rebellion.It’s what I suspected in the woods when I found Bonnie and Twill escaping.Though I never really understood the magnitude. But then, I wasn’t meant tounderstand. I think of Haymitch’s sneering at my plans to flee District 12,start my own uprising, even the very notion that District 13 could exist.Subterfuges and deceptions. And if he could do that, behind his mask of sarcasmand drunkenness, so convincingly and for so long, what else has he lied about? Iknow what else.“Peeta,” I whisper, my heart sinking.“The others kept Peeta alive because if he died, we knew there’d be no keepingyou in an alliance,” says Haymitch. “And we couldn’t risk leaving youunprotected.” His words are matter-of-fact, his expression unchanged, but hecan’t hide the tinge of gray that colors his face.“Where is Peeta?” I hiss at him.“He was picked up by the Capitol along with Johanna and Enobaria,” saysHaymitch. And finally he has the decency to drop his gaze.Technically, I am unarmed. But no one should ever underestimate the harm thatfingernails can do, especially if the target is unprepared. I lunge across thetable and rake mine down Haymitch’s face, causing blood to flow and damage toone eye. Then we are both screaming terrible, terrible things at each other, andFinnick is trying to drag me out, and I know it’s all Haymitch can do not to ripme apart, but I’m the mockingjay. I’m the mockingjay and it’s too hard keepingme alive as it is.Other hands help Finnick and I’m back on my table, my body restrained, my wriststied down, so I slam my head in fury again and again against the table. A needlepokes my arm and my head hurts so badly I stop fighting and simply wail in ahorrible, dying-animal way, until my voice gives out.The drug causes sedation, not sleep, so I am trapped in fuzzy, dully achingmisery for what seems like always. They reinsert their tubes and talk to me insoothing voices that never reach me. All I can think of is Peeta, lying on asimilar table somewhere, while they try to break him for information he doesn’teven have.“Katniss. Katniss, I’m sorry.” Finnick’s voice comes from the bed next to me andslips into my consciousness. Perhaps because we’re in the same kind of pain. “Iwanted to go back for him and Johanna, but I couldn’t move.”I don’t answer. Finnick Odair’s good intentions mean less than nothing.“It’s better for him than Johanna. They’ll figure out he doesn’t know anythingpretty fast. And they won’t kill him if they think they can use him againstyou,” says Finnick.“Like bait?” I say to the ceiling. “Like how they’ll use Annie for bait,Finnick?”I can hear him weeping but I don’t care. They probably won’t even bother toquestion her, she’s so far gone. Gone right off the deep end years ago in herGames. There’s a good chance I’m headed in the same direction. Maybe I’m alreadygoing crazy and no one has the heart to tell me. I feel crazy enough.“I wish she was dead,” he says. “I wish they were all dead and we were, too. Itwould be best.”Well, there’s no good response to that. I can hardly dispute it since I waswalking around with a syringe to kill Peeta when I found them. Do I really wanthim dead? What I want . . . what I want is to have him back. But I’ll never gethim back now. Even if the rebel forces could somehow overthrow the Capitol, youcan be sure President Snow’s last act would be to cut Peeta’s throat. No. I willnever get him back. So then dead is best.But will Peeta know that or will he keep fighting? He’s so strong and such agood liar. Does he think he has a chance of surviving? Does he even care if hedoes? He wasn’t planning on it, anyway. He had already signed off on life.Maybe, if he knows I was rescued, he’s even happy. Feels he fulfilled hismission to keep me alive.I think I hate him even more than I do Haymitch.I give up. Stop speaking, responding, refuse food and water. They can pumpwhatever they want into my arm, but it takes more than that to keep a persongoing once she’s lost the will to live. I even have a funny notion that if I dodie, maybe Peeta will be allowed to live. Not as a free person but as an Avox orsomething, waiting on the future tributes of District 12. Then maybe he couldfind some way to escape. My death could, in fact, still save him.If it can’t, no matter. It’s enough to die of spite. To punish Haymitch, who, ofall the people in this rotting world, has turned Peeta and me into pieces in hisGames. I trusted him. I put what was precious in Haymitch’s hands. And he hasbetrayed me.“See, this is why no one lets you make the plans,” he said.That’s true. No one in their right mind would let me make the plans. Because Iobviously can’t tell a friend from an enemy.A lot of people come by to talk to me, but I make all their words sound like theclicking of the insects in the jungle. Meaningless and distant. Dangerous, butonly if approached. Whenever the words start to become distinct, I moan untilthey give me more painkiller and that fixes things right up.Until one time, I open my eyes and find someone I cannot block out looking downat me. Someone who will not plead, or explain, or think he can alter my designwith entreaties, because he alone really knows how I operate.“Gale,” I whisper.“Hey, Catnip.” He reaches down and pushes a strand of hair out of my eyes. Oneside of his face has been burned fairly recently. His arm is in a sling, and Ican see bandages under his miner’s shirt. What has happened to him? How is heeven here? Something very bad has happened back home.It is not so much a question of forgetting Peeta as remembering the others. Allit takes is one look at Gale and they come surging into the present, demandingto be acknowledged.“Prim?” I gasp.“She’s alive. So is your mother. I got them out in time,” he says.“They’re not in District Twelve?” I ask.“After the Games, they sent in planes. Dropped firebombs.” He hesitates. “Well,you know what happened to the Hob.”I do know. I saw it go up. That old warehouse embedded with coal dust. The wholedistrict’s covered with the stuff. A new kind of horror begins to rise up insideme as I imagine firebombs hitting the Seam.“They’re not in District Twelve?” I repeat. As if saying it will somehow fendoff the truth.“Katniss,” Gale says softly.I recognize that voice. It’s the same one he uses to approach wounded animalsbefore he delivers a deathblow. I instinctively raise my hand to block his wordsbut he catches it and holds on tightly.“Don’t,” I whisper.But Gale is not one to keep secrets from me. “Katniss, there is no DistrictTwelve.”END OF BOOK TWO"},{"pageContent":"About the AuthorSuzanne Collins is the author of the bestselling Underland Chronicles series,which started with"},{"pageContent":"Gregor the Overlander.
