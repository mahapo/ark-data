This is where the bed I shared with my sister, Prim, stood. Over therewas the kitchen table. The bricks of the chimney, which collapsed in a charredheap, provide a point of reference for the rest of the house. How else could Iorient myself in this sea of gray?Almost nothing remains of District 12. A month ago, the Capitol’s firebombsobliterated the poor coal miners’ houses in the Seam, the shops in the town,even the Justice Building. The only area that escaped incineration was theVictor’s Village. I don’t know why exactly. Perhaps so anyone forced to comehere on Capitol business would have somewhere decent to stay. The odd reporter.A committee assessing the condition of the coal mines. A squad of Peacekeeperschecking for returning refugees.But no one is returning except me. And that’s only for a brief visit. Theauthorities in District 13 were against my coming back. They viewed it as acostly and pointless venture, given that at least a dozen invisible hovercraftare circling overhead for my protection and there’s no intelligence to begained. I had to see it, though. So much so that I made it a condition of mycooperating with any of their plans.Finally, Plutarch Heavensbee, the Head Gamemaker who had organized the rebels inthe Capitol, threw up his hands. “Let her go. Better to waste a day than anothermonth. Maybe a little tour of Twelve is just what she needs to convince herwe’re on the same side.”The same side. A pain stabs my left temple and I press my hand against it. Righton the spot where Johanna Mason hit me with the coil of wire. The memories swirlas I try to sort out what is true and what is false. What series of events ledme to be standing in the ruins of my city? This is hard because the effects ofthe concussion she gave me haven’t completely subsided and my thoughts stillhave a tendency to jumble together. Also, the drugs they use to control my painand mood sometimes make me see things. I guess. I’m still not entirely convincedthat I was hallucinating the night the floor of my hospital room transformedinto a carpet of writhing snakes.I use a technique one of the doctors suggested. I start with the simplest thingsI know to be true and work toward the more complicated. The list begins to rollin my head….My name is Katniss Everdeen. I am seventeen years old. My home is District 12. Iwas in the Hunger Games. I escaped. The Capitol hates me. Peeta was takenprisoner. He is thought to be dead. Most likely he is dead. It is probably bestif he is dead….“Katniss. Should I come down?” My best friend Gale’s voice reaches me throughthe headset the rebels insisted I wear. He’s up in a hovercraft, watching mecarefully, ready to swoop in if anything goes amiss. I realize I’m crouched downnow, elbows on my thighs, my head braced between my hands. I must look on theverge of some kind of breakdown. This won’t do. Not when they’re finally weaningme off the medication.I straighten up and wave his offer away. “No. I’m fine.” To reinforce this, Ibegin to move away from my old house and in toward the town. Gale asked to bedropped off in 12 with me, but he didn’t force the issue when I refused hiscompany. He understands I don’t want anyone with me today. Not even him. Somewalks you have to take alone.The summer’s been scorching hot and dry as a bone. There’s been next to no rainto disturb the piles of ash left by the attack. They shift here and there, inreaction to my footsteps. No breeze to scatter them. I keep my eyes on what Iremember as the road, because when I first landed in the Meadow, I wasn’tcareful and I walked right into a rock. Only it wasn’t a rock—it was someone’sskull. It rolled over and over and landed faceup, and for a long time I couldn’tstop looking at the teeth, wondering whose they were, thinking of how mine wouldprobably look the same way under similar circumstances.I stick to the road out of habit, but it’s a bad choice, because it’s full ofthe remains of those who tried to flee. Some were incinerated entirely. Butothers, probably overcome with smoke, escaped the worst of the flames and nowlie reeking in various states of decomposition, carrion for scavengers,blanketed by flies. I killed you, I think as I pass a pile. And you. And you.Because I did. It was my arrow, aimed at the chink in the force fieldsurrounding the arena, that brought on this firestorm of retribution. That sentthe whole country of Panem into chaos.In my head I hear President Snow’s words, spoken the morning I was to begin theVictory Tour. “Katniss Everdeen, the girl who was on fire, you have provided aspark that, left unattended, may grow to an inferno that destroys Panem.” Itturns out he wasn’t exaggerating or simply trying to scare me. He was, perhaps,genuinely attempting to enlist my help. But I had already set something inmotion that I had no ability to control.Burning. Still burning, I think numbly. The fires at the coal mines belch blacksmoke in the distance. There’s no one left to care, though. More than ninetypercent of the district’s population is dead. The remaining eight hundred or soare refugees in District 13—which, as far as I’m concerned, is the same thing asbeing homeless forever.I know I shouldn’t think that; I know I should be grateful for the way we havebeen welcomed. Sick, wounded, starving, and empty-handed. Still, I can never getaround the fact that District 13 was instrumental in 12’s destruction. Thisdoesn’t absolve me of blame—there’s plenty of blame to go around. But withoutthem, I would not have been part of a larger plot to overthrow the Capitol orhad the wherewithal to do it.The citizens of District 12 had no organized resistance movement of their own.No say in any of this. They only had the misfortune to have me. Some survivorsthink it’s good luck, though, to be free of District 12 at last. To have escapedthe endless hunger and oppression, the perilous mines, the lash of our finalHead Peacekeeper, Romulus Thread. To have a new home at all is seen as a wondersince, up until a short time ago, we hadn’t even known that District 13 stillexisted.The credit for the survivors’ escape has landed squarely on Gale’s shoulders,although he’s loath to accept it. As soon as the Quarter Quell was over—as soonas I had been lifted from the arena—the electricity in District 12 was cut, thetelevisions went black, and the Seam became so silent, people could hear oneanother’s heartbeats. No one did anything to protest or celebrate what hadhappened in the arena. Yet within fifteen minutes, the sky was filled withhoverplanes and the bombs were raining down.It was Gale who thought of the Meadow, one of the few places not filled with oldwooden homes embedded with coal dust. He herded those he could in its direction,including my mother and Prim. He formed the team that pulled down the fence—nowjust a harmless chain-link barrier, with the electricity off—and led the peopleinto the woods. He took them to the only place he could think of, the lake myfather had shown me as a child. And it was from there they watched the distantflames eat up everything they knew in the world.By dawn the bombers were long gone, the fires dying, the final stragglersrounded up. My mother and Prim had set up a medical area for the injured andwere attempting to treat them with whatever they could glean from the woods.Gale had two sets of bows and arrows, one hunting knife, one fishing net, andover eight hundred terrified people to feed. With the help of those who wereable-bodied, they managed for three days. And that’s when the hovercraftunexpectedly arrived to evacuate them to District 13, where there were more thanenough clean, white living compartments, plenty of clothing, and three meals aday. The compartments had the disadvantage of being underground, the clothingwas identical, and the food was relatively tasteless, but for the refugees of12, these were minor considerations. They were safe. They were being cared for.They were alive and eagerly welcomed.This enthusiasm was interpreted as kindness. But a man named Dalton, a District10 refugee who’d made it to 13 on foot a few years ago, leaked the real motiveto me. “They need you. Me. They need us all. Awhile back, there was some sort ofpox epidemic that killed a bunch of them and left a lot more infertile. Newbreeding stock. That’s how they see us.” Back in 10, he’d worked on one of thebeef ranches, maintaining the genetic diversity of the herd with theimplantation of long-frozen cow embryos. He’s very likely right about 13,because there don’t seem to be nearly enough kids around. But so what? We’re notbeing kept in pens, we’re being trained for work, the children are beingeducated. Those over fourteen have been given entry-level ranks in the militaryand are addressed respectfully as “Soldier.” Every single refugee was grantedautomatic citizenship by the authorities of 13.Still, I hate them. But, of course, I hate almost everybody now. Myself morethan anyone.The surface beneath my feet hardens, and under the carpet of ash, I feel thepaving stones of the square. Around the perimeter is a shallow border of refusewhere the shops stood. A heap of blackened rubble has replaced the JusticeBuilding. I walk to the approximate site of the bakery Peeta’s family owned.Nothing much left but the melted lump of the oven. Peeta’s parents, his twoolder brothers—none of them made it to 13. Fewer than a dozen of what passed forDistrict 12’s well-to-do escaped the fire. Peeta would have nothing to come hometo, anyway. Except me…I back away from the bakery and bump into something, lose my balance, and findmyself sitting on a hunk of sun-heated metal. I puzzle over what it might havebeen, then remember Thread’s recent renovations of the square. Stocks, whippingposts, and this, the remains of the gallows. Bad. This is bad. It brings on theflood of images that torments me, awake or asleep. Peeta being tortured—drowned,burned, lacerated, shocked, maimed, beaten—as the Capitol tries to getinformation about the rebellion that he doesn’t know. I squeeze my eyes shut andtry to reach for him across the hundreds and hundreds of miles, to send mythoughts into his mind, to let him know he is not alone. But he is. And I can’thelp him.Running. Away from the square and to the one place the fire did not destroy. Ipass the wreckage of the mayor’s house, where my friend Madge lived. No word ofher or her family. Were they evacuated to the Capitol because of her father’sposition, or left to the flames? Ashes billow up around me, and I pull the hemof my shirt up over my mouth. It’s not wondering what I breathe in, but who,that threatens to choke me.The grass has been scorched and the gray snow fell here as well, but the twelvefine houses of the Victor’s Village are unscathed. I bolt into the house I livedin for the past year, slam the door closed, and lean back against it. The placeseems untouched. Clean. Eerily quiet. Why did I come back to 12? How can thisvisit help me answer the question I can’t escape?“What am I going to do?” I whisper to the walls. Because I really don’t know.People keep talking at me, talking, talking, talking. Plutarch Heavensbee. Hiscalculating assistant, Fulvia Cardew. A mishmash of district leaders. Militaryofficials. But not Alma Coin, the president of 13, who just watches. She’s fiftyor so, with gray hair that falls in an unbroken sheet to her shoulders. I’msomewhat fascinated by her hair, since it’s so uniform, so without a flaw, awisp, even a split end. Her eyes are gray, but not like those of people from theSeam. They’re very pale, as if almost all the color has been sucked out of them.The color of slush that you wish would melt away.What they want is for me to truly take on the role they designed for me. Thesymbol of the revolution. The Mockingjay. It isn’t enough, what I’ve done in thepast, defying the Capitol in the Games, providing a rallying point. I must nowbecome the actual leader, the face, the voice, the embodiment of the revolution.The person who the districts—most of which are now openly at war with theCapitol—can count on to blaze the path to victory. I won’t have to do it alone.They have a whole team of people to make me over, dress me, write my speeches,orchestrate my appearances—as if that doesn’t sound horribly familiar—and all Ihave to do is play my part. Sometimes I listen to them and sometimes I justwatch the perfect line of Coin’s hair and try to decide if it’s a wig.Eventually, I leave the room because my head starts to ache or it’s time to eator if I don’t get aboveground I might start screaming. I don’t bother to sayanything. I simply get up and walk out.Yesterday afternoon, as the door was closing behind me, I heard Coin say, “Itold you we should have rescued the boy first.” Meaning Peeta. I couldn’t agreemore. He would’ve been an excellent mouthpiece.And who did they fish out of the arena instead? Me, who won’t cooperate. Beetee,an older inventor from 3, who I rarely see because he was pulled into weaponsdevelopment the minute he could sit upright. Literally, they wheeled hishospital bed into some top secret area and now he only occasionally shows up formeals. He’s very smart and very willing to help the cause, but not reallyfirebrand material. Then there’s Finnick Odair, the sex symbol from the fishingdistrict, who kept Peeta alive in the arena when I couldn’t. They want totransform Finnick into a rebel leader as well, but first they’ll have to get himto stay awake for more than five minutes. Even when he is conscious, you have tosay everything to him three times to get through to his brain. The doctors sayit’s from the electrical shock he received in the arena, but I know it’s a lotmore complicated than that. I know that Finnick can’t focus on anything in 13because he’s trying so hard to see what’s happening in the Capitol to Annie, themad girl from his district who’s the only person on earth he loves.Despite serious reservations, I had to forgive Finnick for his role in theconspiracy that landed me here. He, at least, has some idea of what I’m goingthrough. And it takes too much energy to stay angry with someone who cries somuch.I move through the downstairs on hunter’s feet, reluctant to make any sound. Ipick up a few remembrances: a photo of my parents on their wedding day, a bluehair ribbon for Prim, the family book of medicinal and edible plants. The bookfalls open to a page with yellow flowers and I shut it quickly because it wasPeeta’s brush that painted them.What am I going to do?Is there any point in doing anything at all? My mother, my sister, and Gale’sfamily are finally safe. As for the rest of 12, people are either dead, which isirreversible, or protected in 13. That leaves the rebels in the districts. Ofcourse, I hate the Capitol, but I have no confidence that my being theMockingjay will benefit those who are trying to bring it down. How can I helpthe districts when every time I make a move, it results in suffering and loss oflife? The old man shot in District 11 for whistling. The crackdown in 12 after Iintervened in Gale’s whipping. My stylist, Cinna, being dragged, bloody andunconscious, from the Launch Room before the Games. Plutarch’s sources believehe was killed during interrogation. Brilliant, enigmatic, lovely Cinna is deadbecause of me. I push the thought away because it’s too impossibly painful todwell on without losing my fragile hold on the situation entirely.What am I going to do?To become the Mockingjay…could any good I do possibly outweigh the damage? Whocan I trust to answer that question? Certainly not that crew in 13. I swear, nowthat my family and Gale’s are out of harm’s way, I could run away. Except forone unfinished piece of business. Peeta. If I knew for sure that he was dead, Icould just disappear into the woods and never look back. But until I do, I’mstuck.I spin on my heel at the sound of a hiss. In the kitchen doorway, back arched,ears flattened, stands the ugliest tomcat in the world. “Buttercup,” I say.Thousands of people are dead, but he has survived and even looks well fed. Onwhat? He can get in and out of the house through a window we always left ajar inthe pantry. He must have been eating field mice. I refuse to consider thealternative.I squat down and extend a hand. “Come here, boy.” Not likely. He’s angry at hisabandonment. Besides, I’m not offering food, and my ability to provide scrapshas always been my main redeeming quality to him. For a while, when we used tomeet up at the old house because we both disliked this new one, we seemed to bebonding a little. That’s clearly over. He blinks those unpleasant yellow eyes.“Want to see Prim?” I ask. Her name catches his attention. Besides his own, it’sthe only word that means anything to him. He gives a rusty meow and approachesme. I pick him up, stroking his fur, then go to the closet and dig out my gamebag and unceremoniously stuff him in. There’s no other way I’ll be able to carryhim on the hovercraft, and he means the world to my sister. Her goat, Lady, ananimal of actual value, has unfortunately not made an appearance.In my headset, I hear Gale’s voice telling me we must go back. But the game baghas reminded me of one more thing that I want. I sling the strap of the bag overthe back of a chair and dash up the steps to my bedroom. Inside the closet hangsmy father’s hunting jacket. Before the Quell, I brought it here from the oldhouse, thinking its presence might be of comfort to my mother and sister when Iwas dead. Thank goodness, or it’d be ash now.The soft leather feels soothing and for a moment I’m calmed by the memories ofthe hours spent wrapped in it. Then, inexplicably, my palms begin to sweat. Astrange sensation creeps up the back of my neck. I whip around to face the roomand find it empty. Tidy. Everything in its place. There was no sound to alarmme. What, then?My nose twitches. It’s the smell. Cloying and artificial. A dab of white peeksout of a vase of dried flowers on my dresser. I approach it with cautious steps.There, all but obscured by its preserved cousins, is a fresh white rose.Perfect. Down to the last thorn and silken petal.And I know immediately who’s sent it to me.President Snow.When I begin to gag at the stench, I back away and clear out. How long has itbeen here? A day? An hour? The rebels did a security sweep of the Victor’sVillage before I was cleared to come here, checking for explosives, bugs,anything unusual. But perhaps the rose didn’t seem noteworthy to them. Only tome.Downstairs, I snag the game bag off the chair, bouncing it along the floor untilI remember it’s occupied. On the lawn, I frantically signal to the hovercraftwhile Buttercup thrashes. I jab him with my elbow, but this only infuriates him.A hovercraft materializes and a ladder drops down. I step on and the currentfreezes me until I’m lifted on board.Gale helps me from the ladder. “You all right?”“Yeah,” I say, wiping the sweat off my face with my sleeve.He left me a rose! I want to scream, but it’s not information I’m sure I shouldshare with someone like Plutarch looking on. First of all, because it will makeme sound crazy. Like I either imagined it, which is quite possible, or I’moverreacting, which will buy me a trip back to the drug-induced dreamland I’mtrying so hard to escape. No one will fully understand—how it’s not just aflower, not even just President Snow’s flower, but a promise of revenge—becauseno one else sat in the study with him when he threatened me before the VictoryTour.Positioned on my dresser, that white-as-snow rose is a personal message to me.It speaks of unfinished business. It whispers, I can find you. I can reach you.Perhaps I am watching you now."},{"pageContent":"2 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_02]Are there Capitol hoverplanes speeding in to blow us out of the sky? As wetravel over District 12, I watch anxiously for signs of an attack, but nothingpursues us. After several minutes, when I hear an exchange between Plutarch andthe pilot confirming that the airspace is clear, I begin to relax a little.Gale nods at the howls coming from my game bag. “Now I know why you had to goback.”“If there was even a chance of his recovery.” I dump the bag onto a seat, wherethe loathsome creature begins a low, deep-throated growl. “Oh, shut up,” I tellthe bag as I sink into the cushioned window seat across from it.Gale sits next to me. “Pretty bad down there?”“Couldn’t be much worse,” I answer. I look in his eyes and see my own griefreflected there. Our hands find each other, holding fast to a part of 12 thatSnow has somehow failed to destroy. We sit in silence for the rest of the tripto 13, which only takes about forty-five minutes. A mere week’s journey on foot.Bonnie and Twill, the District 8 refugees who I encountered in the woods lastwinter, weren’t so far from their destination after all. They apparently didn’tmake it, though. When I asked about them in 13, no one seemed to know who I wastalking about. Died in the woods, I guess.From the air, 13 looks about as cheerful as 12. The rubble isn’t smoking, theway the Capitol shows it on television, but there’s next to no life aboveground.In the seventy-five years since the Dark Days—when 13 was said to have beenobliterated in the war between the Capitol and the districts—almost all newconstruction has been beneath the earth’s surface. There was already asubstantial underground facility here, developed over centuries to be either aclandestine refuge for government leaders in time of war or a last resort forhumanity if life above became unlivable. Most important for the people of 13, itwas the center of the Capitol’s nuclear weapons development program. During theDark Days, the rebels in 13 wrested control from the government forces, trainedtheir nuclear missiles on the Capitol, and then struck a bargain: They wouldplay dead in exchange for being left alone. The Capitol had another nucleararsenal out west, but it couldn’t attack 13 without certain retaliation. It wasforced to accept 13’s deal. The Capitol demolished the visible remains of thedistrict and cut off all access from the outside. Perhaps the Capitol’s leadersthought that, without help, 13 would die off on its own. It almost did a fewtimes, but it always managed to pull through due to strict sharing of resources,strenuous discipline, and constant vigilance against any further attacks fromthe Capitol.Now the citizens live almost exclusively underground. You can go outside forexercise and sunlight but only at very specific times in your schedule. Youcan’t miss your schedule. Every morning, you’re supposed to stick your right armin this contraption in the wall. It tattoos the smooth inside of your forearmwith your schedule for the day in a sickly purple ink. 7:00—Breakfast.7:30—Kitchen Duties. 8:30—Education Center, Room 17. And so on. The ink isindelible until 22:00—Bathing. That’s when whatever keeps it water resistantbreaks down and the whole schedule rinses away. The lights-out at 22:30 signalsthat everyone not on the night shift should be in bed.At first, when I was so ill in the hospital, I could forgo being imprinted. Butonce I moved into Compartment 307 with my mother and sister, I was expected toget with the program. Except for showing up for meals, though, I pretty muchignore the words on my arm. I just go back to our compartment or wander around13 or fall asleep somewhere hidden. An abandoned air duct. Behind the waterpipes in the laundry. There’s a closet in the Education Center that’s greatbecause no one ever seems to need school supplies. They’re so frugal with thingshere, waste is practically a criminal activity. Fortunately, the people of 12have never been wasteful. But once I saw Fulvia Cardew crumple up a sheet ofpaper with just a couple of words written on it and you would’ve thought she’dmurdered someone from the looks she got. Her face turned tomato red, making thesilver flowers inlaid in her plump cheeks even more noticeable. The veryportrait of excess. One of my few pleasures in 13 is watching the handful ofpampered Capitol “rebels” squirming as they try to fit in.I don’t know how long I’ll be able to get away with my complete disregard forthe clockwork precision of attendance required by my hosts. Right now, theyleave me alone because I’m classified as mentally disoriented—it says so righton my plastic medical bracelet—and everyone has to tolerate my ramblings. Butthat can’t last forever. Neither can their patience with the Mockingjay issue.From the landing pad, Gale and I walk down a series of stairways to Compartment307. We could take the elevator, only it reminds me too much of the one thatlifted me into the arena. I’m having a hard time adjusting to being undergroundso much. But after the surreal encounter with the rose, for the first time thedescent makes me feel safer.I hesitate at the door marked 307, anticipating the questions from my family.“What am I going to tell them about Twelve?” I ask Gale.“I doubt they’ll ask for details. They saw it burn. They’ll mostly be worriedabout how you’re handling it.” Gale touches my cheek. “Like I am.”I press my face against his hand for a moment. “I’ll survive.”Then I take a deep breath and open the door. My mother and sister are home for18:00—Reflection, a half hour of downtime before dinner. I see the concern ontheir faces as they try to gauge my emotional state. Before anyone can askanything, I empty my game bag and it becomes 18:00—Cat Adoration. Prim just sitson the floor weeping and rocking that awful Buttercup, who interrupts hispurring only for an occasional hiss at me. He gives me a particularly smug lookwhen she ties the blue ribbon around his neck.My mother hugs the wedding photo tightly against her chest and then places it,along with the book of plants, on our government-issued chest of drawers. I hangmy father’s jacket on the back of a chair. For a moment, the place almost seemslike home. So I guess the trip to 12 wasn’t a complete waste.We’re heading down to the dining hall for 18:30—Dinner when Gale’s communicuffbegins to beep. It looks like an oversized watch, but it receives printmessages. Being granted a communicuff is a special privilege that’s reserved forthose important to the cause, a status Gale achieved by his rescue of thecitizens of 12. “They need the two of us in Command,” he says.Trailing a few steps behind Gale, I try to collect myself before I’m thrown intowhat’s sure to be another relentless Mockingjay session. I linger in the doorwayof Command, the high-tech meeting/war council room complete with computerizedtalking walls, electronic maps showing the troop movements in various districts,and a giant rectangular table with control panels I’m not supposed to touch. Noone notices me, though, because they’re all gathered at a television screen atthe far end of the room that airs the Capitol broadcast around the clock. I’mthinking I might be able to slip away when Plutarch, whose ample frame has beenblocking the television, catches sight of me and waves urgently for me to jointhem. I reluctantly move forward, trying to imagine how it could be of interestto me. It’s always the same. War footage. Propaganda. Replaying the bombings ofDistrict 12. An ominous message from President Snow. So it’s almost entertainingto see Caesar Flickerman, the eternal host of the Hunger Games, with his paintedface and sparkly suit, preparing to give an interview. Until the camera pullsback and I see that his guest is Peeta.A sound escapes me. The same combination of gasp and groan that comes from beingsubmerged in water, deprived of oxygen to the point of pain. I push people asideuntil I am right in front of him, my hand resting on the screen. I search hiseyes for any sign of hurt, any reflection of the agony of torture. There isnothing. Peeta looks healthy to the point of robustness. His skin is glowing,flawless, in that full-body-polish way. His manner’s composed, serious. I can’treconcile this image with the battered, bleeding boy who haunts my dreams.Caesar settles himself more comfortably in the chair across from Peeta and giveshim a long look. “So…Peeta…welcome back.”Peeta smiles slightly. “I bet you thought you’d done your last interview withme, Caesar.”“I confess, I did,” says Caesar. “The night before the Quarter Quell…well, whoever thought we’d see you again?”“It wasn’t part of my plan, that’s for sure,” says Peeta with a frown.Caesar leans in to him a little. “I think it was clear to all of us what yourplan was. To sacrifice yourself in the arena so that Katniss Everdeen and yourchild could survive.”“That was it. Clear and simple.” Peeta’s fingers trace the upholstered patternon the arm of the chair. “But other people had plans as well.”Yes, other people had plans, I think. Has Peeta guessed, then, how the rebelsused us as pawns? How my rescue was arranged from the beginning? And finally,how our mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, betrayed us both for a cause he pretended tohave no interest in?In the silence that follows, I notice the lines that have formed between Peeta’seyebrows. He has guessed or he has been told. But the Capitol has not killed oreven punished him. For right now, that exceeds my wildest hopes. I drink in hiswholeness, the soundness of his body and mind. It runs through me like themorphling they give me in the hospital, dulling the pain of the last weeks.“Why don’t you tell us about that last night in the arena?” suggests Caesar.“Help us sort a few things out.”Peeta nods but takes his time speaking. “That last night…to tell you about thatlast night…well, first of all, you have to imagine how it felt in the arena. Itwas like being an insect trapped under a bowl filled with steaming air. And allaround you, jungle…green and alive and ticking. That giant clock ticking awayyour life. Every hour promising some new horror. You have to imagine that in thepast two days, sixteen people have died—some of them defending you. At the ratethings are going, the last eight will be dead by morning. Save one. The victor.And your plan is that it won’t be you.”My body breaks out in a sweat at the memory. My hand slides down the screen andhangs limply at my side. Peeta doesn’t need a brush to paint images from theGames. He works just as well in words.“Once you’re in the arena, the rest of the world becomes very distant,” hecontinues. “All the people and things you loved or cared about almost cease toexist. The pink sky and the monsters in the jungle and the tributes who wantyour blood become your final reality, the only one that ever mattered. As bad asit makes you feel, you’re going to have to do some killing, because in thearena, you only get one wish. And it’s very costly.”“It costs your life,” says Caesar.“Oh, no. It costs a lot more than your life. To murder innocent people?” saysPeeta. “It costs everything you are.”“Everything you are,” repeats Caesar quietly.A hush has fallen over the room, and I can feel it spreading across Panem. Anation leaning in toward its screens. Because no one has ever talked about whatit’s really like in the arena before.Peeta goes on. “So you hold on to your wish. And that last night, yes, my wishwas to save Katniss. But even without knowing about the rebels, it didn’t feelright. Everything was too complicated. I found myself regretting I hadn’t runoff with her earlier in the day, as she had suggested. But there was no gettingout of it at that point.”“You were too caught up in Beetee’s plan to electrify the salt lake,” saysCaesar.“Too busy playing allies with the others. I should have never let them separateus!” Peeta bursts out. “That’s when I lost her.”“When you stayed at the lightning tree, and she and Johanna Mason took the coilof wire down to the water,” Caesar clarifies.“I didn’t want to!” Peeta flushes in agitation. “But I couldn’t argue withBeetee without indicating we were about to break away from the alliance. Whenthat wire was cut, everything just went insane. I can only remember bits andpieces. Trying to find her. Watching Brutus kill Chaff. Killing Brutus myself. Iknow she was calling my name. Then the lightning bolt hit the tree, and theforce field around the arena…blew out.”“Katniss blew it out, Peeta,” says Caesar. “You’ve seen the footage.”“She didn’t know what she was doing. None of us could follow Beetee’s plan. Youcan see her trying to figure out what to do with that wire,” Peeta snaps back.“All right. It just looks suspicious,” says Caesar. “As if she was part of therebels’ plan all along.”Peeta’s on his feet, leaning in to Caesar’s face, hands locked on the arms ofhis interviewer’s chair. “Really? And was it part of her plan for Johanna tonearly kill her? For that electric shock to paralyze her? To trigger thebombing?” He’s yelling now. “She didn’t know, Caesar! Neither of us knewanything except that we were trying to keep each other alive!”Caesar places his hand on Peeta’s chest in a gesture that’s both self-protectiveand conciliatory. “Okay, Peeta, I believe you.”“Okay.” Peeta withdraws from Caesar, pulling back his hands, running themthrough his hair, mussing his carefully styled blond curls. He slumps back inhis chair, distraught.Caesar waits a moment, studying Peeta. “What about your mentor, HaymitchAbernathy?”Peeta’s face hardens. “I don’t know what Haymitch knew.”“Could he have been part of the conspiracy?” asks Caesar.“He never mentioned it,” says Peeta.Caesar presses on. “What does your heart tell you?”“That I shouldn’t have trusted him,” says Peeta. “That’s all.”I haven’t seen Haymitch since I attacked him on the hovercraft, leaving longclaw marks down his face. I know it’s been bad for him here. District 13strictly forbids any production or consumption of intoxicating beverages, andeven the rubbing alcohol in the hospital is kept under lock and key. Finally,Haymitch is being forced into sobriety, with no secret stashes or home-brewedconcoctions to ease his transition. They’ve got him in seclusion until he’sdried out, as he’s not deemed fit for public display. It must be excruciating,but I lost all my sympathy for Haymitch when I realized how he had deceived us.I hope he’s watching the Capitol broadcast now, so he can see that Peeta hascast him off as well.Caesar pats Peeta’s shoulder. “We can stop now if you want.”“Was there more to discuss?” says Peeta wryly.“I was going to ask your thoughts on the war, but if you’re too upset…” beginsCaesar.“Oh, I’m not too upset to answer that.” Peeta takes a deep breath and then looksstraight into the camera. “I want everyone watching—whether you’re on theCapitol or the rebel side—to stop for just a moment and think about what thiswar could mean. For human beings. We almost went extinct fighting one anotherbefore. Now our numbers are even fewer. Our conditions more tenuous. Is thisreally what we want to do? Kill ourselves off completely? In the hopesthat—what? Some decent species will inherit the smoking remains of the earth?”“I don’t really…I’m not sure I’m following…” says Caesar.“We can’t fight one another, Caesar,” Peeta explains. “There won’t be enough ofus left to keep going. If everybody doesn’t lay down their weapons—and I mean,as in very soon—it’s all over, anyway.”“So…you’re calling for a cease-fire?” Caesar asks.“Yes. I’m calling for a cease-fire,” says Peeta tiredly. “Now why don’t we askthe guards to take me back to my quarters so I can build another hundred cardhouses?”Caesar turns to the camera. “All right. I think that wraps it up. So back to ourregularly scheduled programming.”Music plays them out, and then there’s a woman reading a list of expectedshortages in the Capitol—fresh fruit, solar batteries, soap. I watch her withuncharacteristic absorption, because I know everyone will be waiting for myreaction to the interview. But there’s no way I can process it all soquickly—the joy of seeing Peeta alive and unharmed, his defense of my innocencein collaborating with the rebels, and his undeniable complicity with the Capitolnow that he’s called for a cease-fire. Oh, he made it sound as if he werecondemning both sides in the war. But at this point, with only minor victoriesfor the rebels, a cease-fire could only result in a return to our previousstatus. Or worse.Behind me, I can hear the accusations against Peeta building. The words traitor,liar, and enemy bounce off the walls. Since I can neither join in the rebels’outrage nor counter it, I decide the best thing to do is clear out. As I reachthe door, Coin’s voice rises above the others. “You have not been dismissed,Soldier Everdeen.”One of Coin’s men lays a hand on my arm. It’s not an aggressive move, really,but after the arena, I react defensively to any unfamiliar touch. I jerk my armfree and take off running down the halls. Behind me, there’s the sound of ascuffle, but I don’t stop. My mind does a quick inventory of my odd littlehiding places, and I wind up in the supply closet, curled up against a crate ofchalk.“You’re alive,” I whisper, pressing my palms against my cheeks, feeling thesmile that’s so wide it must look like a grimace. Peeta’s alive. And a traitor.But at the moment, I don’t care. Not what he says, or who he says it for, onlythat he is still capable of speech.After a while, the door opens and someone slips in. Gale slides down beside me,his nose trickling blood.“What happened?” I ask.“I got in Boggs’s way,” he answers with a shrug. I use my sleeve to wipe hisnose. “Watch it!”I try to be gentler. Patting, not wiping. “Which one is he?”“Oh, you know. Coin’s right-hand lackey. The one who tried to stop you.” Hepushes my hand away. “Quit! You’ll bleed me to death.”The trickle has turned to a steady stream. I give up on the first-aid attempts.“You fought with Boggs?”“No, just blocked the doorway when he tried to follow you. His elbow caught mein the nose,” says Gale.“They’ll probably punish you,” I say.“Already have.” He holds up his wrist. I stare at it uncomprehendingly. “Cointook back my communicuff.”I bite my lip, trying to remain serious. But it seems so ridiculous. “I’m sorry,Soldier Gale Hawthorne.”“Don’t be, Soldier Katniss Everdeen.” He grins. “I felt like a jerk walkingaround with it anyway.” We both start laughing. “I think it was quite ademotion.”This is one of the few good things about 13. Getting Gale back. With thepressure of the Capitol’s arranged marriage between Peeta and me gone, we’vemanaged to regain our friendship. He doesn’t push it any further—try to kiss meor talk about love. Either I’ve been too sick, or he’s willing to give me space,or he knows it’s just too cruel with Peeta in the hands of the Capitol. Whateverthe case, I’ve got someone to tell my secrets to again.“Who are these people?” I say.“They’re us. If we’d had nukes instead of a few lumps of coal,” he answers.“I like to think Twelve wouldn’t have abandoned the rest of the rebels back inthe Dark Days,” I say.“We might have. If it was that, surrender, or start a nuclear war,” says Gale.“In a way, it’s remarkable they survived at all.”Maybe it’s because I still have the ashes of my own district on my shoes, butfor the first time, I give the people of 13 something I have withheld from them:credit. For staying alive against all odds. Their early years must have beenterrible, huddled in the chambers beneath the ground after their city was bombedto dust. Population decimated, no possible ally to turn to for aid. Over thepast seventy-five years, they’ve learned to be self-sufficient, turned theircitizens into an army, and built a new society with no help from anyone. Theywould be even more powerful if that pox epidemic hadn’t flattened theirbirthrate and made them so desperate for a new gene pool and breeders. Maybethey are militaristic, overly programmed, and somewhat lacking in a sense ofhumor. They’re here. And willing to take on the Capitol.“Still, it took them long enough to show up,” I say.“It wasn’t simple. They had to build up a rebel base in the Capitol, get somesort of underground organized in the districts,” he says. “Then they neededsomeone to set the whole thing in motion. They needed you.”“They needed Peeta, too, but they seem to have forgotten that,” I say.Gale’s expression darkens. “Peeta might have done a lot of damage tonight. Mostof the rebels will dismiss what he said immediately, of course. But there aredistricts where the resistance is shakier. The cease-fire’s clearly PresidentSnow’s idea. But it seems so reasonable coming out of Peeta’s mouth.”I’m afraid of Gale’s answer, but I ask anyway. “Why do you think he said it?”“He might have been tortured. Or persuaded. My guess is he made some kind ofdeal to protect you. He’d put forth the idea of the cease-fire if Snow let himpresent you as a confused pregnant girl who had no idea what was going on whenshe was taken prisoner by the rebels. This way, if the districts lose, there’sstill a chance of leniency for you. If you play it right.” I must still lookperplexed because Gale delivers the next line very slowly. “Katniss…he’s stilltrying to keep you alive.”To keep me alive? And then I understand. The Games are still on. We have leftthe arena, but since Peeta and I weren’t killed, his last wish to preserve mylife still stands. His idea is to have me lie low, remain safe and imprisoned,while the war plays out. Then neither side will really have cause to kill me.And Peeta? If the rebels win, it will be disastrous for him. If the Capitolwins, who knows? Maybe we’ll both be allowed to live—if I play it right—to watchthe Games go on….Images flash through my mind: the spear piercing Rue’s body in the arena, Galehanging senseless from the whipping post, the corpse-littered wasteland of myhome. And for what? For what? As my blood turns hot, I remember other things. Myfirst glimpse of an uprising in District 8. The victors locked hand in hand thenight before the Quarter Quell. And how it was no accident, my shooting thatarrow into the force field in the arena. How badly I wanted it to lodge deep inthe heart of my enemy.I spring up, upsetting a box of a hundred pencils, sending them scatteringaround the floor.“What is it?” Gale asks.“There can’t be a cease-fire.” I lean down, fumbling as I shove the sticks ofdark gray graphite back into the box. “We can’t go back.”“I know.” Gale sweeps up a handful of pencils and taps them on the floor intoperfect alignment.“Whatever reason Peeta had for saying those things, he’s wrong.” The stupidsticks won’t go in the box and I snap several in my frustration.“I know. Give it here. You’re breaking them to bits.” He pulls the box from myhands and refills it with swift, concise motions.“He doesn’t know what they did to Twelve. If he could’ve seen what was on theground—” I start.“Katniss, I’m not arguing. If I could hit a button and kill every living soulworking for the Capitol, I would do it. Without hesitation.” He slides the lastpencil into the box and flips the lid closed. “The question is, what are yougoing to do?”It turns out the question that’s been eating away at me has only ever had onepossible answer. But it took Peeta’s ploy for me to recognize it.What am I going to do?I take a deep breath. My arms rise slightly—as if recalling the black-and-whitewings Cinna gave me—then come to rest at my sides.“I’m going to be the Mockingjay.”"},{"pageContent":"3 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_03]Buttercup’s eyes reflect the faint glow of the safety light over the door as helies in the crook of Prim’s arm, back on the job, protecting her from the night.She’s snuggled close to my mother. Asleep, they look just as they did themorning of the reaping that landed me in my first Games. I have a bed to myselfbecause I’m recuperating and because no one can sleep with me anyway, what withthe nightmares and the thrashing around.After tossing and turning for hours, I finally accept that it will be a wakefulnight. Under Buttercup’s watchful eye, I tiptoe across the cold tiled floor tothe dresser.The middle drawer contains my government-issued clothes. Everyone wears the samegray pants and shirt, the shirt tucked in at the waist. Underneath the clothes,I keep the few items I had on me when I was lifted from the arena. My mockingjaypin. Peeta’s token, the gold locket with photos of my mother and Prim and Galeinside. A silver parachute that holds a spile for tapping trees, and the pearlPeeta gave me a few hours before I blew out the force field. District 13confiscated my tube of skin ointment for use in the hospital, and my bow andarrows because only guards have clearance to carry weapons. They’re insafekeeping in the armory.I feel around for the parachute and slide my fingers inside until they closearound the pearl. I sit back on my bed cross-legged and find myself rubbing thesmooth iridescent surface of the pearl back and forth against my lips. For somereason, it’s soothing. A cool kiss from the giver himself.“Katniss?” Prim whispers. She’s awake, peering at me through the darkness.“What’s wrong?”“Nothing. Just a bad dream. Go back to sleep.” It’s automatic. Shutting Prim andmy mother out of things to shield them.Careful not to rouse my mother, Prim eases herself from the bed, scoops upButtercup, and sits beside me. She touches the hand that has curled around thepearl. “You’re cold.” Taking a spare blanket from the foot of the bed, she wrapsit around all three of us, enveloping me in her warmth and Buttercup’s furryheat as well. “You could tell me, you know. I’m good at keeping secrets. Evenfrom Mother.”She’s really gone, then. The little girl with the back of her shirt sticking outlike a duck tail, the one who needed help reaching the dishes, and who begged tosee the frosted cakes in the bakery window. Time and tragedy have forced her togrow too quickly, at least for my taste, into a young woman who stitchesbleeding wounds and knows our mother can hear only so much.“Tomorrow morning, I’m going to agree to be the Mockingjay,” I tell her.“Because you want to or because you feel forced into it?” she asks.I laugh a little. “Both, I guess. No, I want to. I have to, if it will help therebels defeat Snow.” I squeeze the pearl more tightly in my fist. “It’sjust…Peeta. I’m afraid if we do win, the rebels will execute him as a traitor.”Prim thinks this over. “Katniss, I don’t think you understand how important youare to the cause. Important people usually get what they want. If you want tokeep Peeta safe from the rebels, you can.”I guess I’m important. They went to a lot of trouble to rescue me. They took meto 12. “You mean…I could demand that they give Peeta immunity? And they’d haveto agree to it?”“I think you could demand almost anything and they’d have to agree to it.” Primwrinkles her brow. “Only how do you know they’ll keep their word?”I remember all of the lies Haymitch told Peeta and me to get us to do what hewanted. What’s to keep the rebels from reneging on the deal? A verbal promisebehind closed doors, even a statement written on paper—these could easilyevaporate after the war. Their existence or validity denied. Any witnesses inCommand will be worthless. In fact, they’d probably be the ones writing outPeeta’s death warrant. I’ll need a much larger pool of witnesses. I’ll needeveryone I can get.“It will have to be public,” I say. Buttercup gives a flick of his tail that Itake as agreement. “I’ll make Coin announce it in front of the entire populationof Thirteen.”Prim smiles. “Oh, that’s good. It’s not a guarantee, but it will be much harderfor them to back out of their promise.”I feel the kind of relief that follows an actual solution. “I should wake you upmore often, little duck.”“I wish you would,” says Prim. She gives me a kiss. “Try and sleep now, allright?” And I do.In the morning, I see that 7:00—Breakfast is directly followed by 7:30—Command,which is fine since I may as well start the ball rolling. At the dining hall, Iflash my schedule, which includes some kind of ID number, in front of a sensor.As I slide my tray along the metal shelf before the vats of food, I seebreakfast is its usual dependable self—a bowl of hot grain, a cup of milk, and asmall scoop of fruit or vegetables. Today, mashed turnips. All of it comes from13’s underground farms. I sit at the table assigned to the Everdeens and theHawthornes and some other refugees, and shovel my food down, wishing forseconds, but there are never seconds here. They have nutrition down to ascience. You leave with enough calories to take you to the next meal, no more,no less. Serving size is based on your age, height, body type, health, andamount of physical labor required by your schedule. The people from 12 arealready getting slightly larger portions than the natives of 13 in an effort tobring us up to weight. I guess bony soldiers tire too quickly. It’s working,though. In just a month, we’re starting to look healthier, particularly thekids.Gale sets his tray beside me and I try not to stare at his turnips toopathetically, because I really want more, and he’s already too quick to slip mehis food. Even though I turn my attention to neatly folding my napkin, aspoonful of turnips slops into my bowl.“You’ve got to stop that,” I say. But since I’m already scooping up the stuff,it’s not too convincing. “Really. It’s probably illegal or something.” They havevery strict rules about food. For instance, if you don’t finish something andwant to save it for later, you can’t take it from the dining hall. Apparently,in the early days, there was some incident of food hoarding. For a couple ofpeople like Gale and me, who’ve been in charge of our families’ food supply foryears, it doesn’t sit well. We know how to be hungry, but not how to be told howto handle what provisions we have. In some ways, District 13 is even morecontrolling than the Capitol.“What can they do? They’ve already got my communicuff,” says Gale.As I scrape my bowl clean, I have an inspiration. “Hey, maybe I should make thata condition of being the Mockingjay.”“That I can feed you turnips?” he says.“No, that we can hunt.” That gets his attention. “We’d have to give everythingto the kitchen. But still, we could…” I don’t have to finish because he knows.We could be aboveground. Out in the woods. We could be ourselves again.“Do it,” he says. “Now’s the time. You could ask for the moon and they’d have tofind some way to get it.”He doesn’t know that I’m already asking for the moon by demanding they sparePeeta’s life. Before I can decide whether or not to tell him, a bell signals theend of our eating shift. The thought of facing Coin alone makes me nervous.“What are you scheduled for?”Gale checks his arm. “Nuclear History class. Where, by the way, your absence hasbeen noted.”“I have to go to Command. Come with me?” I ask.“All right. But they might throw me out after yesterday.” As we go to drop offour trays, he says, “You know, you better put Buttercup on your list of demands,too. I don’t think the concept of useless pets is well known here.”“Oh, they’ll find him a job. Tattoo it on his paw every morning,” I say. But Imake a mental note to include him for Prim’s sake.By the time we get to Command, Coin, Plutarch, and all their people have alreadyassembled. The sight of Gale raises some eyebrows, but no one throws him out. Mymental notes have become too jumbled, so I ask for a piece of paper and a pencilright off. My apparent interest in the proceedings—the first I’ve shown sinceI’ve been here—takes them by surprise. Several looks are exchanged. Probablythey had some extra-special lecture planned for me. But instead, Coin personallyhands me the supplies, and everyone waits in silence while I sit at the tableand scrawl out my list. Buttercup. Hunting. Peeta’s immunity. Announced inpublic.This is it. Probably my only chance to bargain. Think. What else do you want? Ifeel him, standing at my shoulder. Gale, I add to the list. I don’t think I cando this without him.The headache’s coming on and my thoughts begin to tangle. I shut my eyes andstart to recite silently.My name is Katniss Everdeen. I am seventeen years old. My home is District 12. Iwas in the Hunger Games. I escaped. The Capitol hates me. Peeta was takenprisoner. He is alive. He is a traitor but alive. I have to keep him alive….The list. It still seems too small. I should try to think bigger, beyond ourcurrent situation where I am of the utmost importance, to the future where I maybe worth nothing. Shouldn’t I be asking for more? For my family? For theremainder of my people? My skin itches with the ashes of the dead. I feel thesickening impact of the skull against my shoe. The scent of blood and rosesstings my nose.The pencil moves across the page on its own. I open my eyes and see the wobblyletters. I KILL SNOW. If he’s captured, I want the privilege.Plutarch gives a discreet cough. “About done there?” I glance up and notice theclock. I’ve been sitting here for twenty minutes. Finnick isn’t the only onewith attention problems.“Yeah,” I say. My voice sounds hoarse, so I clear my throat. “Yeah, so this isthe deal. I’ll be your Mockingjay.”I wait so they can make their sounds of relief, congratulate, slap one anotheron the back. Coin stays as impassive as ever, watching me, unimpressed.“But I have some conditions.” I smooth out the list and begin. “My family getsto keep our cat.” My tiniest request sets off an argument. The Capitol rebelssee this as a nonissue—of course, I can keep my pet—while those from 13 spellout what extreme difficulties this presents. Finally it’s worked out that we’llbe moved to the top level, which has the luxury of an eight-inch windowaboveground. Buttercup may come and go to do his business. He will be expectedto feed himself. If he misses curfew, he will be locked out. If he causes anysecurity problems, he’ll be shot immediately.That sounds okay. Not so different from how he’s been living since we left.Except for the shooting part. If he looks too thin, I can slip him a fewentrails, provided my next request is allowed.“I want to hunt. With Gale. Out in the woods,” I say. This gives everyone pause.“We won’t go far. We’ll use our own bows. You can have the meat for thekitchen,” adds Gale.I hurry on before they can say no. “It’s just…I can’t breathe shut up here likea…I would get better, faster, if…I could hunt.”Plutarch begins to explain the drawbacks here—the dangers, the extra security,the risk of injury—but Coin cuts him off. “No. Let them. Give them two hours aday, deducted from their training time. A quarter-mile radius. Withcommunication units and tracker anklets. What’s next?”I skim my list. “Gale. I’ll need him with me to do this.”“With you how? Off camera? By your side at all times? Do you want him presentedas your new lover?” Coin asks.She hasn’t said this with any particular malice—quite the contrary, her wordsare very matter-of-fact. But my mouth still drops open in shock. “What?”“I think we should continue the current romance. A quick defection from Peetacould cause the audience to lose sympathy for her,” says Plutarch. “Especiallysince they think she’s pregnant with his child.”“Agreed. So, on-screen, Gale can simply be portrayed as a fellow rebel. Is thatall right?” says Coin. I just stare at her. She repeats herself impatiently.“For Gale. Will that be sufficient?”“We can always work him in as your cousin,” says Fulvia.“We’re not cousins,” Gale and I say together.“Right, but we should probably keep that up for appearances’ sake on camera,”says Plutarch. “Off camera, he’s all yours. Anything else?”I’m rattled by the turn in the conversation. The implications that I could soreadily dispose of Peeta, that I’m in love with Gale, that the whole thing hasbeen an act. My cheeks begin to burn. The very notion that I’m devoting anythought to who I want presented as my lover, given our current circumstances, isdemeaning. I let my anger propel me into my greatest demand. “When the war isover, if we’ve won, Peeta will be pardoned.”Dead silence. I feel Gale’s body tense. I guess I should have told him before,but I wasn’t sure how he’d respond. Not when it involved Peeta.“No form of punishment will be inflicted,” I continue. A new thought occurs tome. “The same goes for the other captured tributes, Johanna and Enobaria.”Frankly, I don’t care about Enobaria, the vicious District 2 tribute. In fact, Idislike her, but it seems wrong to leave her out.“No,” says Coin flatly.“Yes,” I shoot back. “It’s not their fault you abandoned them in the arena. Whoknows what the Capitol’s doing to them?”“They’ll be tried with other war criminals and treated as the tribunal seesfit,” she says.“They’ll be granted immunity!” I feel myself rising from my chair, my voice fulland resonant. “You will personally pledge this in front of the entire populationof District Thirteen and the remainder of Twelve. Soon. Today. It will berecorded for future generations. You will hold yourself and your governmentresponsible for their safety, or you’ll find yourself another Mockingjay!”My words hang in the air for a long moment.“That’s her!” I hear Fulvia hiss to Plutarch. “Right there. With the costume,gunfire in the background, just a hint of smoke.”“Yes, that’s what we want,” says Plutarch under his breath.I want to glare at them, but I feel it would be a mistake to turn my attentionfrom Coin. I can see her tallying the cost of my ultimatum, weighing it againstmy possible worth.“What do you say, President?” asks Plutarch. “You could issue an officialpardon, given the circumstances. The boy…he’s not even of age.”“All right,” Coin says finally. “But you’d better perform.”“I’ll perform when you’ve made the announcement,” I say.“Call a national security assembly during Reflection today,” she orders. “I’llmake the announcement then. Is there anything left on your list, Katniss?”My paper’s crumpled into a ball in my right fist. I flatten the sheet againstthe table and read the rickety letters. “Just one more thing. I kill Snow.”For the first time ever, I see the hint of a smile on the president’s lips.“When the time comes, I’ll flip you for it.”Maybe she’s right. I certainly don’t have the sole claim against Snow’s life.And I think I can count on her getting the job done. “Fair enough.”Coin’s eyes have flickered to her arm, the clock. She, too, has a schedule toadhere to. “I’ll leave her in your hands, then, Plutarch.” She exits the room,followed by her team, leaving only Plutarch, Fulvia, Gale, and myself.“Excellent. Excellent.” Plutarch sinks down, elbows on the table, rubbing hiseyes. “You know what I miss? More than anything? Coffee. I ask you, would it beso unthinkable to have something to wash down the gruel and turnips?”“We didn’t think it would be quite so rigid here,” Fulvia explains to us as shemassages Plutarch’s shoulders. “Not in the higher ranks.”“Or at least there’d be the option of a little side action,” says Plutarch. “Imean, even Twelve had a black market, right?”“Yeah, the Hob,” says Gale. “It’s where we traded.”“There, you see? And look how moral you two are! Virtually incorruptible.”Plutarch sighs. “Oh, well, wars don’t last forever. So, glad to have you on theteam.” He reaches a hand out to the side, where Fulvia is already extending alarge sketchbook bound in black leather. “You know in general what we’re askingof you, Katniss. I’m aware you have mixed feelings about participating. I hopethis will help.”Plutarch slides the sketchbook across to me. For a moment, I look at itsuspiciously. Then curiosity gets the better of me. I open the cover to find apicture of myself, standing straight and strong, in a black uniform. Only oneperson could have designed the outfit, at first glance utterly utilitarian, atsecond a work of art. The swoop of the helmet, the curve to the breastplate, theslight fullness of the sleeves that allows the white folds under the arms toshow. In his hands, I am again a mockingjay.“Cinna,” I whisper.“Yes. He made me promise not to show you this book until you’d decided to be theMockingjay on your own. Believe me, I was very tempted,” says Plutarch. “Go on.Flip through.”I turn the pages slowly, seeing each detail of the uniform. The carefullytailored layers of body armor, the hidden weapons in the boots and belt, thespecial reinforcements over my heart. On the final page, under a sketch of mymockingjay pin, Cinna’s written, I’m still betting on you.“When did he…” My voice fails me.“Let’s see. Well, after the Quarter Quell announcement. A few weeks before theGames maybe? There are not only the sketches. We have your uniforms. Oh, andBeetee’s got something really special waiting for you down in the armory. Iwon’t spoil it by hinting,” says Plutarch.“You’re going to be the best-dressed rebel in history,” says Gale with a smile.Suddenly, I realize he’s been holding out on me. Like Cinna, he’s wanted me tomake this decision all along.“Our plan is to launch an Airtime Assault,” says Plutarch. “To make a series ofwhat we call propos—which is short for ‘propaganda spots’—featuring you, andbroadcast them to the entire population of Panem.”“How? The Capitol has sole control of the broadcasts,” says Gale.“But we have Beetee. About ten years ago, he essentially redesigned theunderground network that transmits all the programming. He thinks there’s areasonable chance it can be done. Of course, we’ll need something to air. So,Katniss, the studio awaits your pleasure.” Plutarch turns to his assistant.“Fulvia?”“Plutarch and I have been talking about how on earth we can pull this off. Wethink that it might be best to build you, our rebel leader, from the outside…in.That is to say, let’s find the most stunning Mockingjay look possible, and thenwork your personality up to deserving it!” she says brightly.“You already have her uniform,” says Gale.“Yes, but is she scarred and bloody? Is she glowing with the fire of rebellion?Just how grimy can we make her without disgusting people? At any rate, she hasto be something. I mean, obviously this”—Fulvia moves in on me quickly, framingmy face with her hands—“won’t cut it.” I jerk my head back reflexively but she’salready busy gathering her things. “So, with that in mind, we have anotherlittle surprise for you. Come, come.”Fulvia gives us a wave, and Gale and I follow her and Plutarch out into thehall.“So well intended, and yet so insulting,” Gale whispers in my ear.“Welcome to the Capitol,” I mouth back. But Fulvia’s words have no effect on me.I wrap my arms tightly around the sketchbook and allow myself to feel hopeful.This must be the right decision. If Cinna wanted it.We board an elevator, and Plutarch checks his notes. “Let’s see. It’sCompartment Three-Nine-Oh-Eight.” He presses a button marked 39, but nothinghappens.“You must have to key it,” says Fulvia.Plutarch pulls a key attached to a thin chain from under his shirt and insertsit into a slot I hadn’t noticed before. The doors slide shut. “Ah, there weare.”The elevator descends ten, twenty, thirty-plus levels, farther down than I evenknew District 13 went. It opens on a wide white corridor lined with red doors,which look almost decorative compared to the gray ones on the upper floors. Eachis plainly marked with a number. 3901, 3902, 3903…As we step out, I glance behind me to watch the elevator close and see ametallic grate slide into place over the regular doors. When I turn, a guard hasmaterialized from one of the rooms at the far end of the corridor. A door swingssilently shut behind him as he strides toward us.Plutarch moves to meet him, raising a hand in greeting, and the rest of usfollow behind him. Something feels very wrong down here. It’s more than thereinforced elevator, or the claustrophobia of being so far underground, or thecaustic smell of antiseptic. One look at Gale’s face and I can tell he senses itas well.“Good morning, we were just looking for—” Plutarch begins.“You have the wrong floor,” says the guard abruptly.“Really?” Plutarch double-checks his notes. “I’ve got Three-Nine-Oh-Eightwritten right here. I wonder if you could just give a call up to—”“I’m afraid I have to ask you to leave now. Assignment discrepancies can beaddressed at the Head Office,” says the guard.It’s right ahead of us. Compartment 3908. Just a few steps away. The door—infact, all the doors—seem incomplete. No knobs. They must swing free on hingeslike the one the guard appeared through.“Where is that again?” asks Fulvia.“You’ll find the Head Office on Level Seven,” says the guard, extending his armsto corral us back to the elevator.From behind door 3908 comes a sound. Just a tiny whimper. Like something a coweddog might make to avoid being struck, only all too human and familiar. My eyesmeet Gale’s for just a moment, but it’s long enough for two people who operatethe way we do. I let Cinna’s sketchbook fall at the guard’s feet with a loudbang. A second after he leans down to retrieve it, Gale leans down, too,intentionally bumping heads. “Oh, I’m sorry,” he says with a light laugh,catching the guard’s arms as if to steady himself, turning him slightly awayfrom me.That’s my chance. I dart around the distracted guard, push open the door marked3908, and find them. Half-naked, bruised, and shackled to the wall.My prep team."},{"pageContent":"4 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_04]The stink of unwashed bodies, stale urine, and infection breaks through thecloud of antiseptic. The three figures are only just recognizable by their moststriking fashion choices: Venia’s gold facial tattoos. Flavius’s orangecorkscrew curls. Octavia’s light evergreen skin, which now hangs too loosely, asif her body were a slowly deflating balloon.On seeing me, Flavius and Octavia shrink back against the tiled walls likethey’re anticipating an attack, even though I have never hurt them. Unkindthoughts were my worst offense against them, and those I kept to myself, so whydo they recoil?The guard’s ordering me out, but by the shuffling that follows, I know Gale hassomehow detained him. For answers, I cross to Venia, who was always thestrongest. I crouch down and take her icy hands, which clutch mine like vises.“What happened, Venia?” I ask. “What are you doing here?”“They took us. From the Capitol,” she says hoarsely.Plutarch enters behind me. “What on earth is going on?”“Who took you?” I press her.“People,” she says vaguely. “The night you broke out.”“We thought it might be comforting for you to have your regular team,” Plutarchsays behind me. “Cinna requested it.”“Cinna requested this?” I snarl at him. Because if there’s one thing I know,it’s that Cinna would never have approved the abuse of these three, who hemanaged with gentleness and patience. “Why are they being treated likecriminals?”“I honestly don’t know.” There’s something in his voice that makes me believehim, and the pallor on Fulvia’s face confirms it. Plutarch turns to the guard,who’s just appeared in the doorway with Gale right behind him. “I was only toldthey were being confined. Why are they being punished?”“For stealing food. We had to restrain them after an altercation over somebread,” says the guard.Venia’s brows come together as if she’s still trying to make sense of it. “Noone would tell us anything. We were so hungry. It was just one slice she took.”Octavia begins to sob, muffling the sound in her ragged tunic. I think of how,the first time I survived the arena, Octavia sneaked me a roll under the tablebecause she couldn’t bear my hunger. I crawl across to her shaking form.“Octavia?” I touch her and she flinches. “Octavia? It’s going to be all right.I’ll get you out of here, okay?”“This seems extreme,” says Plutarch.“It’s because they took a slice of bread?” asks Gale.“There were repeated infractions leading up to that. They were warned. Stillthey took more bread.” The guard pauses a moment, as if puzzled by our density.“You can’t take bread.”I can’t get Octavia to uncover her face, but she lifts it slightly. The shackleson her wrists shift down a few inches, revealing raw sores beneath them. “I’mbringing you to my mother.” I address the guard. “Unchain them.”The guard shakes his head. “It’s not authorized.”“Unchain them! Now!” I yell.This breaks his composure. Average citizens don’t address him this way. “I haveno release orders. And you have no authority to—”“Do it on my authority,” says Plutarch. “We came to collect these three anyway.They’re needed for Special Defense. I’ll take full responsibility.”The guard leaves to make a call. He returns with a set of keys. The preps havebeen forced into cramped body positions for so long that even once the shacklesare removed, they have trouble walking. Gale, Plutarch, and I have to help them.Flavius’s foot catches on a metal grate over a circular opening in the floor,and my stomach contracts when I think of why a room would need a drain. Thestains of human misery that must have been hosed off these white tiles…In the hospital, I find my mother, the only one I trust to care for them. Ittakes her a minute to place the three, given their current condition, butalready she wears a look of consternation. And I know it’s not a result ofseeing abused bodies, because they were her daily fare in District 12, but therealization that this sort of thing goes on in 13 as well.My mother was welcomed into the hospital, but she’s viewed as more of a nursethan a doctor, despite her lifetime of healing. Still, no one interferes whenshe guides the trio into an examination room to assess their injuries. I plantmyself on a bench in the hall outside the hospital entrance, waiting to hear herverdict. She will be able to read in their bodies the pain inflicted upon them.Gale sits next to me and puts an arm around my shoulder. “She’ll fix them up.” Igive a nod, wondering if he’s thinking about his own brutal flogging back in 12.Plutarch and Fulvia take the bench across from us but don’t offer any commentson the state of my prep team. If they had no knowledge of the mistreatment, thenwhat do they make of this move on President Coin’s part? I decide to help themout.“I guess we’ve all been put on notice,” I say.“What? No. What do you mean?” asks Fulvia.“Punishing my prep team’s a warning,” I tell her. “Not just to me. But to you,too. About who’s really in control and what happens if she’s not obeyed. If youhad any delusions about having power, I’d let them go now. Apparently, a Capitolpedigree is no protection here. Maybe it’s even a liability.”“There is no comparison between Plutarch, who masterminded the rebel breakout,and those three beauticians,” says Fulvia icily.I shrug. “If you say so, Fulvia. But what would happen if you got on Coin’s badside? My prep team was kidnapped. They can at least hope to one day return tothe Capitol. Gale and I can live in the woods. But you? Where would you tworun?”“Perhaps we’re a little more necessary to the war effort than you give us creditfor,” says Plutarch, unconcerned.“Of course you are. The tributes were necessary to the Games, too. Until theyweren’t,” I say. “And then we were very disposable—right, Plutarch?”That ends the conversation. We wait in silence until my mother finds us.“They’ll be all right,” she reports. “No permanent physical injuries.”“Good. Splendid,” says Plutarch. “How soon can they be put to work?”“Probably tomorrow,” she answers. “You’ll have to expect some emotionalinstability, after what they’ve been through. They were particularly illprepared, coming from their life in the Capitol.”“Weren’t we all?” says Plutarch.Either because the prep team’s incapacitated or I’m too on edge, Plutarchreleases me from Mockingjay duties for the rest of the day. Gale and I head downto lunch, where we’re served bean and onion stew, a thick slice of bread, and acup of water. After Venia’s story, the bread sticks in my throat, so I slide therest of it onto Gale’s tray. Neither of us speaks much during lunch, but whenour bowls are clean, Gale pulls up his sleeve, revealing his schedule. “I’ve gottraining next.”I tug up my sleeve and hold my arm next to his. “Me, too.” I remember thattraining equals hunting now.My eagerness to escape into the woods, if only for two hours, overrides mycurrent concerns. An immersion into greenery and sunlight will surely help mesort out my thoughts. Once off the main corridors, Gale and I race likeschoolchildren for the armory, and by the time we arrive, I’m breathless anddizzy. A reminder that I’m not fully recovered. The guards provide our oldweapons, as well as knives and a burlap sack that’s meant for a game bag. Itolerate having the tracker clamped to my ankle, try to look as if I’m listeningwhen they explain how to use the handheld communicator. The only thing thatsticks in my head is that it has a clock, and we must be back inside 13 by thedesignated hour or our hunting privileges will be revoked. This is one rule Ithink I will make an effort to abide.We go outside into the large, fenced-in training area beside the woods. Guardsopen the well-oiled gates without comment. We would be hard-pressed to get pastthis fence on our own—thirty feet high and always buzzing with electricity,topped with razor-sharp curls of steel. We move through the woods until the viewof the fence has been obscured. In a small clearing, we pause and drop back ourheads to bask in the sunlight. I turn in a circle, my arms extended at my sides,revolving slowly so as not to set the world spinning.The lack of rain I saw in 12 has damaged the plants here as well, leaving somewith brittle leaves, building a crunchy carpet under our feet. We take off ourshoes. Mine don’t fit right anyway, since in the spirit of waste-not-want-notthat rules 13, I was issued a pair someone had outgrown. Apparently, one of uswalks funny, because they’re broken in all wrong.We hunt, like in the old days. Silent, needing no words to communicate, becausehere in the woods we move as two parts of one being. Anticipating each other’smovements, watching each other’s backs. How long has it been? Eight months?Nine? Since we had this freedom? It’s not exactly the same, given all that’shappened and the trackers on our ankles and the fact that I have to rest sooften. But it’s about as close to happiness as I think I can currently get.The animals here are not nearly suspicious enough. That extra moment it takes toplace our unfamiliar scent means their death. In an hour and a half, we’ve got amixed dozen—rabbits, squirrels, and turkeys—and decide to knock off to spend theremaining time by a pond that must be fed by an underground spring, since thewater’s cool and sweet.When Gale offers to clean the game, I don’t object. I stick a few mint leaves onmy tongue, close my eyes, and lean back against a rock, soaking in the sounds,letting the scorching afternoon sun burn my skin, almost at peace until Gale’svoice interrupts me. “Katniss, why do you care so much about your prep team?”I open my eyes to see if he’s joking, but he’s frowning down at the rabbit he’sskinning. “Why shouldn’t I?”“Hm. Let’s see. Because they’ve spent the last year prettying you up forslaughter?” he suggests.“It’s more complicated than that. I know them. They’re not evil or cruel.They’re not even smart. Hurting them, it’s like hurting children. They don’tsee…I mean, they don’t know…” I get knotted up in my words.“They don’t know what, Katniss?” he says. “That tributes—who are the actualchildren involved here, not your trio of freaks—are forced to fight to thedeath? That you were going into that arena for people’s amusement? Was that abig secret in the Capitol?”“No. But they don’t view it the way we do,” I say. “They’re raised on it and—”“Are you actually defending them?” He slips the skin from the rabbit in onequick move.That stings, because, in fact, I am, and it’s ridiculous. I struggle to find alogical position. “I guess I’m defending anyone who’s treated like that fortaking a slice of bread. Maybe it reminds me too much of what happened to youover a turkey!”Still, he’s right. It does seem strange, my level of concern over the prep team.I should hate them and want to see them strung up. But they’re so clueless, andthey belonged to Cinna, and he was on my side, right?“I’m not looking for a fight,” Gale says. “But I don’t think Coin was sendingyou some big message by punishing them for breaking the rules here. She probablythought you’d see it as a favor.” He stuffs the rabbit in the sack and rises.“We better get going if we want to make it back on time.”I ignore his offer of a hand up and get to my feet unsteadily. “Fine.” Neitherof us talks on the way back, but once we’re inside the gate, I think ofsomething else. “During the Quarter Quell, Octavia and Flavius had to quitbecause they couldn’t stop crying over me going back in. And Venia could barelysay good-bye.”“I’ll try and keep that in mind as they…remake you,” says Gale.“Do,” I say.We hand the meat over to Greasy Sae in the kitchen. She likes District 13 wellenough, even though she thinks the cooks are somewhat lacking in imagination.But a woman who came up with a palatable wild dog and rhubarb stew is bound tofeel as if her hands are tied here.Exhausted from hunting and my lack of sleep, I go back to my compartment to findit stripped bare, only to remember we’ve been moved because of Buttercup. I makemy way up to the top floor and find Compartment E. It looks exactly likeCompartment 307, except for the window—two feet wide, eight inches high—centeredat the top of the outside wall. There’s a heavy metal plate that fastens overit, but right now it’s propped open, and a certain cat is nowhere to be seen. Istretch out on my bed, and a shaft of afternoon sunlight plays on my face. Thenext thing I know, my sister is waking me for 18:00—Reflection.Prim tells me they’ve been announcing the assembly since lunch. The entirepopulation, except those needed for essential jobs, is required to attend. Wefollow directions to the Collective, a huge room that easily holds the thousandswho show up. You can tell it was built for a larger gathering, and perhaps itheld one before the pox epidemic. Prim quietly points out the widespread falloutfrom that disaster—the pox scars on people’s bodies, the slightly disfiguredchildren. “They’ve suffered a lot here,” she says.After this morning, I’m in no mood to feel sorry for 13. “No more than we did inTwelve,” I say. I see my mother lead in a group of mobile patients, stillwearing their hospital nightgowns and robes. Finnick stands among them, lookingdazed but gorgeous. In his hands he holds a piece of thin rope, less than a footin length, too short for even him to fashion into a usable noose. His fingersmove rapidly, automatically tying and unraveling various knots as he gazesabout. Probably part of his therapy. I cross to him and say, “Hey, Finnick.” Hedoesn’t seem to notice, so I nudge him to get his attention. “Finnick! How areyou doing?”“Katniss,” he says, gripping my hand. Relieved to see a familiar face, I think.“Why are we meeting here?”“I told Coin I’d be her Mockingjay. But I made her promise to give the othertributes immunity if the rebels won,” I tell him. “In public, so there areplenty of witnesses.”“Oh. Good. Because I worry about that with Annie. That she’ll say something thatcould be construed as traitorous without knowing it,” says Finnick.Annie. Uh-oh. Totally forgot her. “Don’t worry, I took care of it.” I giveFinnick’s hand a squeeze and head straight for the podium at the front of theroom. Coin, who is glancing over her statement, raises her eyebrows at me. “Ineed you to add Annie Cresta to the immunity list,” I tell her.The president frowns slightly. “Who’s that?”“She’s Finnick Odair’s—” What? I don’t really know what to call her. “She’sFinnick’s friend. From District Four. Another victor. She was arrested and takento the Capitol when the arena blew up.”“Oh, the mad girl. That’s not really necessary,” she says. “We don’t make ahabit of punishing anyone that frail.”I think of the scene I walked in on this morning. Of Octavia huddled against thewall. Of how Coin and I must have vastly different definitions of frailty. But Ionly say, “No? Then it shouldn’t be a problem to add Annie.”“All right,” says the president, penciling in Annie’s name. “Do you want to beup here with me for the announcement?” I shake my head. “I didn’t think so.Better hurry and lose yourself in the crowd. I’m about to begin.” I make my wayback to Finnick.Words are another thing not wasted in 13. Coin calls the audience to attentionand tells them I have consented to be the Mockingjay, provided the othervictors—Peeta, Johanna, Enobaria, and Annie—will be granted full pardon for anydamage they do to the rebel cause. In the rumbling of the crowd, I hear thedissent. I suppose no one doubted I would want to be the Mockingjay. So naming aprice—one that spares possible enemies—angers them. I stand indifferent to thehostile looks thrown my way.The president allows a few moments of unrest, and then continues in her briskfashion. Only now the words coming out of her mouth are news to me. “But inreturn for this unprecedented request, Soldier Everdeen has promised to devoteherself to our cause. It follows that any deviance from her mission, in eithermotive or deed, will be viewed as a break in this agreement. The immunity wouldbe terminated and the fate of the four victors determined by the law of DistrictThirteen. As would her own. Thank you.”In other words, I step out of line and we’re all dead."},{"pageContent":"5 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_05]Another force to contend with. Another power player who has decided to use me asa piece in her games, although things never seem to go according to plan. Firstthere were the Gamemakers, making me their star and then scrambling to recoverfrom that handful of poisonous berries. Then President Snow, trying to use me toput out the flames of rebellion, only to have my every move become inflammatory.Next, the rebels ensnaring me in the metal claw that lifted me from the arena,designating me to be their Mockingjay, and then having to recover from the shockthat I might not want the wings. And now Coin, with her fistful of preciousnukes and her well-oiled machine of a district, finding it’s even harder togroom a Mockingjay than to catch one. But she has been the quickest to determinethat I have an agenda of my own and am therefore not to be trusted. She has beenthe first to publicly brand me as a threat.I run my fingers through the thick layer of bubbles in my tub. Cleaning me up isjust a preliminary step to determining my new look. With my acid-damaged hair,sunburned skin, and ugly scars, the prep team has to make me pretty and thendamage, burn, and scar me in a more attractive way.“Remake her to Beauty Base Zero,” Fulvia ordered first thing this morning.“We’ll work from there.” Beauty Base Zero turns out to be what a person wouldlook like if they stepped out of bed looking flawless but natural. It means mynails are perfectly shaped but not polished. My hair soft and shiny but notstyled. My skin smooth and clear but not painted. Wax the body hair and erasethe dark circles, but don’t make any noticeable enhancements. I suppose Cinnagave the same instructions the first day I arrived as a tribute in the Capitol.Only that was different, since I was a contestant. As a rebel, I thought I’d getto look more like myself. But it seems a televised rebel has her own standardsto live up to.After I rinse the lather from my body, I turn to find Octavia waiting with atowel. She is so altered from the woman I knew in the Capitol, stripped of thegaudy clothing, the heavy makeup, the dyes and jewelry and knickknacks sheadorned her hair with. I remember how one day she showed up with bright pinktresses studded with blinking colored lights shaped like mice. She told me shehad several mice at home as pets. The thought repulsed me at the time, since weconsider mice vermin, unless cooked. But perhaps Octavia liked them because theywere small, soft, and squeaky. Like her. As she pats me dry, I try to becomeacquainted with the District 13 Octavia. Her real hair turns out to be a niceauburn. Her face is ordinary but has an undeniable sweetness. She’s younger thanI thought. Maybe early twenties. Devoid of the three-inch decorative nails, herfingers appear almost stubby, and they can’t stop trembling. I want to tell herit’s okay, that I’ll see that Coin never hurts her again. But the multicoloredbruises flowering under her green skin only remind me how impotent I am.Flavius, too, appears washed out without his purple lipstick and bright clothes.He’s managed to get his orange ringlets back in some sort of order, though. It’sVenia who’s the least changed. Her aqua hair lies flat instead of in spikes andyou can see the roots growing in gray. However, the tattoos were always her moststriking characteristic, and they’re as golden and shocking as ever. She comesand takes the towel from Octavia’s hands.“Katniss is not going to hurt us,” she says quietly but firmly to Octavia.“Katniss did not even know we were here. Things will be better now.” Octaviagives a slight nod but doesn’t dare look me in the eye.It’s no simple job getting me back to Beauty Base Zero, even with the elaboratearsenal of products, tools, and gadgets Plutarch had the foresight to bring fromthe Capitol. My preps do pretty well until they try to address the spot on myarm where Johanna dug out the tracker. None of the medical team was focusing onlooks when they patched up the gaping hole. Now I have a lumpy, jagged scar thatripples out over a space the size of an apple. Usually, my sleeve covers it, butthe way Cinna’s Mockingjay costume is designed, the sleeves stop just above theelbow. It’s such a concern that Fulvia and Plutarch are called in to discuss it.I swear, the sight of it triggers Fulvia’s gag reflex. For someone who workswith a Gamemaker, she’s awfully sensitive. But I guess she’s used to seeingunpleasant things only on a screen.“Everyone knows I have a scar here,” I say sullenly.“Knowing it and seeing it are two different things,” says Fulvia. “It’spositively repulsive. Plutarch and I will think of something during lunch.”“It’ll be fine,” says Plutarch with a dismissive wave of his hand. “Maybe anarmband or something.”Disgusted, I get dressed so I can head to the dining hall. My prep team huddlesin a little group by the door. “Are they bringing your food here?” I ask.“No,” says Venia. “We’re supposed to go to a dining hall.”I sigh inwardly as I imagine walking into the dining hall, trailed by thesethree. But people always stare at me anyway. This will be more of the same.“I’ll show you where it is,” I say. “Come on.”The covert glances and quiet murmurs I usually evoke are nothing compared to thereaction brought on by the sight of my bizarre-looking prep team. The gapingmouths, the finger pointing, the exclamations. “Just ignore them,” I tell myprep team. Eyes downcast, with mechanical movements, they follow me through theline, accepting bowls of grayish fish and okra stew and cups of water.We take seats at my table, beside a group from the Seam. They show a little morerestraint than the people from 13 do, although it may just be fromembarrassment. Leevy, who was my neighbor back in 12, gives a cautious hello tothe preps, and Gale’s mother, Hazelle, who must know about their imprisonment,holds up a spoonful of the stew. “Don’t worry,” she says. “Tastes better than itlooks.”But it’s Posy, Gale’s five-year-old sister, who helps the most. She scoots alongthe bench to Octavia and touches her skin with a tentative finger. “You’regreen. Are you sick?”“It’s a fashion thing, Posy. Like wearing lipstick,” I say.“It’s meant to be pretty,” whispers Octavia, and I can see the tears threateningto spill over her lashes.Posy considers this and says matter-of-factly, “I think you’d be pretty in anycolor.”The tiniest of smiles forms on Octavia’s lips. “Thank you.”“If you really want to impress Posy, you’ll have to dye yourself bright pink,”says Gale, thumping his tray down beside me. “That’s her favorite color.” Posygiggles and slides back down to her mother. Gale nods at Flavius’s bowl. “Iwouldn’t let that get cold. It doesn’t improve the consistency.”Everyone gets down to eating. The stew doesn’t taste bad, but there’s a certainsliminess that’s hard to get around. Like you have to swallow every bite threetimes before it really goes down.Gale, who’s not usually much of a talker during meals, makes an effort to keepthe conversation going, asking about the makeover. I know it’s his attempt atsmoothing things over. We argued last night after he suggested I’d left Coin nochoice but to counter my demand for the victors’ safety with one of her own.“Katniss, she’s running this district. She can’t do it if it seems like she’scaving in to your will.”“You mean she can’t stand any dissent, even if it’s fair,” I’d countered.“I mean you put her in a bad position. Making her give Peeta and the othersimmunity when we don’t even know what sort of damage they might cause,” Gale hadsaid.“So I should’ve just gone with the program and let the other tributes take theirchances? Not that it matters, because that’s what we’re all doing anyway!” Thatwas when I’d slammed the door in his face. I hadn’t sat with him at breakfast,and when Plutarch had sent him down to training this morning, I’d let him gowithout a word. I know he only spoke out of concern for me, but I really needhim to be on my side, not Coin’s. How can he not know that?After lunch, Gale and I are scheduled to go down to Special Defense to meetBeetee. As we ride the elevator, Gale finally says, “You’re still angry.”“And you’re still not sorry,” I reply.“I still stand by what I said. Do you want me to lie about it?” he asks.“No, I want you to rethink it and come up with the right opinion,” I tell him.But this just makes him laugh. I have to let it go. There’s no point in tryingto dictate what Gale thinks. Which, if I’m honest, is one reason I trust him.The Special Defense level is situated almost as far down as the dungeons wherewe found the prep team. It’s a beehive of rooms full of computers, labs,research equipment, and testing ranges.When we ask for Beetee, we’re directed through the maze until we reach anenormous plate-glass window. Inside is the first beautiful thing I’ve seen inthe District 13 compound: a replication of a meadow, filled with real trees andflowering plants, and alive with hummingbirds. Beetee sits motionless in awheelchair at the center of the meadow, watching a spring-green bird hover inmidair as it sips nectar from a large orange blossom. His eyes follow the birdas it darts away, and he catches sight of us. He gives a friendly wave for us tojoin him inside.The air’s cool and breathable, not humid and muggy as I’d expected. From allsides comes the whir of tiny wings, which I used to confuse with the sound ofinsects in our woods at home. I have to wonder what sort of fluke allowed such apleasing place to be built here.Beetee still has the pallor of someone in convalescence, but behind thoseill-fitting glasses, his eyes are alight with excitement. “Aren’t theymagnificent? Thirteen has been studying their aerodynamics here for years.Forward and backward flight, and speeds up to sixty miles per hour. If only Icould build you wings like these, Katniss!”“Doubt I could manage them, Beetee,” I laugh.“Here one second, gone the next. Can you bring a hummingbird down with anarrow?” he asks.“I’ve never tried. Not much meat on them,” I answer.“No. And you’re not one to kill for sport,” he says. “I bet they’d be hard toshoot, though.”“You could snare them maybe,” Gale says. His face takes on that distant look itwears when he’s working something out. “Take a net with a very fine mesh.Enclose an area and leave a mouth of a couple square feet. Bait the inside withnectar flowers. While they’re feeding, snap the mouth shut. They’d fly away fromthe noise but only encounter the far side of the net.”“Would that work?” asks Beetee.“I don’t know. Just an idea,” says Gale. “They might outsmart it.”“They might. But you’re playing on their natural instincts to flee danger.Thinking like your prey…that’s where you find their vulnerabilities,” saysBeetee.I remember something I don’t like to think about. In preparation for the Quell,I saw a tape where Beetee, who was still a boy, connected two wires thatelectrocuted a pack of kids who were hunting him. The convulsing bodies, thegrotesque expressions. Beetee, in the moments that led up to his victory inthose long-ago Hunger Games, watched the others die. Not his fault. Onlyself-defense. We were all acting only in self-defense….Suddenly, I want to leave the hummingbird room before somebody starts setting upa snare. “Beetee, Plutarch said you had something for me.”“Right. I do. Your new bow.” He presses a hand control on the arm of the chairand wheels out of the room. As we follow him through the twists and turns ofSpecial Defense, he explains about the chair. “I can walk a little now. It’sjust that I tire so quickly. It’s easier for me to get around this way. How’sFinnick doing?”“He’s…he’s having concentration problems,” I answer. I don’t want to say he hada complete mental meltdown.“Concentration problems, eh?” Beetee smiles grimly. “If you knew what Finnick’sbeen through the last few years, you’d know how remarkable it is he’s still withus at all. Tell him I’ve been working on a new trident for him, though, willyou? Something to distract him a little.” Distraction seems to be the last thingFinnick needs, but I promise to pass on the message.Four soldiers guard the entrance to the hall marked Special Weaponry. Checkingthe schedules printed on our forearms is just a preliminary step. We also havefingerprint, retinal, and DNA scans, and have to step through special metaldetectors. Beetee has to leave his wheelchair outside, although they provide himwith another once we’re through security. I find the whole thing bizarre becauseI can’t imagine anyone raised in District 13 being a threat the government wouldhave to guard against. Have these precautions been put in place because of therecent influx of immigrants?At the door of the armory, we encounter a second round of identificationchecks—as if my DNA might have changed in the time it took to walk twenty yardsdown the hallway—and are finally allowed to enter the weapons collection. I haveto admit the arsenal takes my breath away. Row upon row of firearms, launchers,explosives, armored vehicles. “Of course, the Airborne Division is housedseparately,” Beetee tells us.“Of course,” I say, as if this would be self-evident. I don’t know where asimple bow and arrow could possibly find a place in all this high-techequipment, but then we come upon a wall of deadly archery weapons. I’ve playedwith a lot of the Capitol’s weapons in training, but none designed for militarycombat. I focus my attention on a lethal-looking bow so loaded down with scopesand gadgetry, I’m certain I can’t even lift it, let alone shoot it.“Gale, maybe you’d like to try out a few of these,” says Beetee.“Seriously?” Gale asks.“You’ll be issued a gun eventually for battle, of course. But if you appear aspart of Katniss’s team in the propos, one of these would look a little showier.I thought you might like to find one that suits you,” says Beetee.“Yeah, I would.” Gale’s hands close around the very bow that caught my attentiona moment ago, and he hefts it onto his shoulder. He points it around the room,peering through the scope.“That doesn’t seem very fair to the deer,” I say.“Wouldn’t be using it on deer, would I?” he answers.“I’ll be right back,” says Beetee. He presses a code into a panel, and a smalldoorway opens. I watch until he’s disappeared and the door’s shut.“So, it’d be easy for you? Using that on people?” I ask.“I didn’t say that.” Gale drops the bow to his side. “But if I’d had a weaponthat could’ve stopped what I saw happen in Twelve…if I’d had a weapon that couldhave kept you out of the arena…I’d have used it.”“Me, too,” I admit. But I don’t know what to tell him about the aftermath ofkilling a person. About how they never leave you.Beetee wheels back in with a tall, black rectangular case awkwardly positionedbetween his footrest and his shoulder. He comes to a halt and tilts it towardme. “For you.”I set the case flat on the floor and undo the latches along one side. The topopens on silent hinges. Inside the case, on a bed of crushed maroon velvet, liesa stunning black bow. “Oh,” I whisper in admiration. I lift it carefully intothe air to admire the exquisite balance, the elegant design, and the curve ofthe limbs that somehow suggests the wings of a bird extended in flight. There’ssomething else. I have to hold very still to make sure I’m not imagining it. No,the bow is alive in my hands. I press it against my cheek and feel the slighthum travel through the bones of my face. “What’s it doing?” I ask.“Saying hello,” explains Beetee with a grin. “It heard your voice.”“It recognizes my voice?” I ask.“Only your voice,” he tells me. “You see, they wanted me to design a bow basedpurely on looks. As part of your costume, you know? But I kept thinking, What awaste. I mean, what if you do need it sometime? As more than a fashionaccessory? So I left the outside simple, and left the inside to my imagination.Best explained in practice, though. Want to try those out?”We do. A target range has already been prepared for us. The arrows that Beeteedesigned are no less remarkable than the bow. Between the two, I can shoot withaccuracy over one hundred yards. The variety of arrows—razor sharp, incendiary,explosive—turn the bow into a multipurpose weapon. Each one is recognizable by adistinctive colored shaft. I have the option of voice override at any time, buthave no idea why I would use it. To deactivate the bow’s special properties, Ineed only tell it “Good night.” Then it goes to sleep until the sound of myvoice wakes it again.I’m in good spirits by the time I get back to the prep team, leaving Beetee andGale behind. I sit patiently through the rest of the paint job and don mycostume, which now includes a bloody bandage over the scar on my arm to indicateI’ve been in recent combat. Venia affixes my mockingjay pin over my heart. Itake up my bow and the sheath of normal arrows that Beetee made, knowing theywould never let me walk around with the loaded ones. Then we’re out on thesoundstage, where I seem to stand for hours while they adjust makeup andlighting and smoke levels. Eventually, the commands coming via intercom from theinvisible people in the mysterious glassed-in booth become fewer and fewer.Fulvia and Plutarch spend more time studying and less time adjusting me.Finally, there’s quiet on the set. For a full five minutes I am simplyconsidered. Then Plutarch says, “I think that does it.”I’m beckoned over to a monitor. They play back the last few minutes of tapingand I watch the woman on the screen. Her body seems larger in stature, moreimposing than mine. Her face smudged but sexy. Her brows black and drawn in anangle of defiance. Wisps of smoke—suggesting she has either just beenextinguished or is about to burst into flames—rise from her clothes. I do notknow who this person is.Finnick, who’s been wandering around the set for a few hours, comes up behind meand says with a hint of his old humor, “They’ll either want to kill you, kissyou, or be you.”Everyone’s so excited, so pleased with their work. It’s nearly time to break fordinner, but they insist we continue. Tomorrow we’ll focus on speeches andinterviews and have me pretend to be in rebel battles. Today they want just oneslogan, just one line that they can work into a short propo to show to Coin.“People of Panem, we fight, we dare, we end our hunger for justice!” That’s theline. I can tell by the way they present it that they’ve spent months, maybeyears, working it out and are really proud of it. It seems like a mouthful tome, though. And stiff. I can’t imagine actually saying it in real life—unless Iwas using a Capitol accent and making fun of it. Like when Gale and I used toimitate Effie Trinket’s “May the odds be ever in your favor!” But Fulvia’s rightin my face, describing a battle I’ve just been in, and how my comrades-in-armsare all lying dead around me, and how, to rally the living, I must turn to thecamera and shout out the line!I’m hustled back to my place, and the smoke machine kicks in. Someone calls forquiet, the cameras start rolling, and I hear “Action!” So I hold my bow over myhead and yell with all the anger I can muster, “People of Panem, we fight, wedare, we end our hunger for justice!”There’s dead silence on the set. It goes on. And on.Finally, the intercom crackles and Haymitch’s acerbic laugh fills the studio. Hecontains himself just long enough to say, “And that, my friends, is how arevolution dies.”"},{"pageContent":"6 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_06]The shock of hearing Haymitch’s voice yesterday, of learning that he was notonly functional but had some measure of control over my life again, enraged me.I left the studio directly and refused to acknowledge his comments from thebooth today. Even so, I knew immediately he was right about my performance.It took the whole of this morning for him to convince the others of mylimitations. That I can’t pull it off. I can’t stand in a television studiowearing a costume and makeup in a cloud of fake smoke and rally the districts tovictory. It’s amazing, really, how long I have survived the cameras. The creditfor that, of course, goes to Peeta. Alone, I can’t be the Mockingjay.We gather around the huge table in Command. Coin and her people. Plutarch,Fulvia, and my prep team. A group from 12 that includes Haymitch and Gale, butalso a few others I can’t explain, like Leevy and Greasy Sae. At the lastminute, Finnick wheels Beetee in, accompanied by Dalton, the cattle expert from10. I suppose that Coin has assembled this strange assortment of people aswitnesses to my failure.However, it’s Haymitch who welcomes everyone, and by his words I understand thatthey have come at his personal invitation. This is the first time we’ve been ina room together since I clawed him. I avoid looking at him directly, but I catcha glimpse of his reflection in one of the shiny control consoles along the wall.He looks slightly yellow and has lost a lot of weight, giving him a shrunkenappearance. For a second, I’m afraid he’s dying. I have to remind myself that Idon’t care.The first thing Haymitch does is to show the footage we’ve just shot. I seem tohave reached some new low under Plutarch and Fulvia’s guidance. Both my voiceand body have a jerky, disjointed quality, like a puppet being manipulated byunseen forces.“All right,” Haymitch says when it’s over. “Would anyone like to argue that thisis of use to us in winning the war?” No one does. “That saves time. So, let’sall be quiet for a minute. I want everyone to think of one incident whereKatniss Everdeen genuinely moved you. Not where you were jealous of herhairstyle, or her dress went up in flames or she made a halfway decent shot withan arrow. Not where Peeta was making you like her. I want to hear one momentwhere she made you feel something real.”Quiet stretches out and I’m beginning to think it will never end, when Leevyspeaks up. “When she volunteered to take Prim’s place at the reaping. BecauseI’m sure she thought she was going to die.”“Good. Excellent example,” says Haymitch. He takes a purple marker and writes ona notepad. “Volunteered for sister at reaping.” Haymitch looks around the table.“Somebody else.”I’m surprised that the next speaker is Boggs, who I think of as a muscular robotthat does Coin’s bidding. “When she sang the song. While the little girl died.”Somewhere in my head an image surfaces of Boggs with a young boy perched up onhis hip. In the dining hall, I think. Maybe he’s not a robot after all.“Who didn’t get choked up at that, right?” says Haymitch, writing it down.“I cried when she drugged Peeta so she could go get him medicine and when shekissed him good-bye!” blurts out Octavia. Then she covers her mouth, like she’ssure this was a bad mistake.But Haymitch only nods. “Oh, yeah. Drugs Peeta to save his life. Very nice.”The moments begin to come thick and fast and in no particular order. When I tookRue on as an ally. Extended my hand to Chaff on interview night. Tried to carryMags. And again and again when I held out those berries that meant differentthings to different people. Love for Peeta. Refusal to give in under impossibleodds. Defiance of the Capitol’s inhumanity.Haymitch holds up the notepad. “So, the question is, what do all of these havein common?”“They were Katniss’s,” says Gale quietly. “No one told her what to do or say.”“Unscripted, yes!” says Beetee. He reaches over and pats my hand. “So we shouldjust leave you alone, right?”People laugh. I even smile a little.“Well, that’s all very nice but not very helpful,” says Fulvia peevishly.“Unfortunately, her opportunities for being wonderful are rather limited here inThirteen. So unless you’re suggesting we toss her into the middle of combat—”“That’s exactly what I’m suggesting,” says Haymitch. “Put her out in the fieldand just keep the cameras rolling.”“But people think she’s pregnant,” Gale points out.“We’ll spread the word that she lost the baby from the electrical shock in thearena,” Plutarch replies. “Very sad. Very unfortunate.”The idea of sending me into combat is controversial. But Haymitch has a prettytight case. If I perform well only in real-life circumstances, then into them Ishould go. “Every time we coach her or give her lines, the best we can hope foris okay. It has to come from her. That’s what people are responding to.”“Even if we’re careful, we can’t guarantee her safety,” says Boggs. “She’ll be atarget for every—”“I want to go,” I break in. “I’m no help to the rebels here.”“And if you’re killed?” asks Coin.“Make sure you get some footage. You can use that, anyway,” I answer.“Fine,” says Coin. “But let’s take it one step at a time. Find the leastdangerous situation that can evoke some spontaneity in you.” She walks aroundCommand, studying the illuminated district maps that show the ongoing trooppositions in the war. “Take her into Eight this afternoon. There was heavybombing this morning, but the raid seems to have run its course. I want herarmed with a squad of bodyguards. Camera crew on the ground. Haymitch, you’ll beairborne and in contact with her. Let’s see what happens there. Does anyone haveany other comments?”“Wash her face,” says Dalton. Everyone turns to him. “She’s still a girl and youmade her look thirty-five. Feels wrong. Like something the Capitol would do.”As Coin adjourns the meeting, Haymitch asks her if he can speak to me privately.The others leave except for Gale, who lingers uncertainly by my side. “What areyou worried about?” Haymitch asks him. “I’m the one who needs the bodyguard.”“It’s okay,” I tell Gale, and he goes. Then there’s just the hum of theinstruments, the purr of the ventilation system.Haymitch takes the seat across from me. “We’re going to have to work togetheragain. So, go ahead. Just say it.”I think of the snarling, cruel exchange back on the hovercraft. The bitternessthat followed. But all I say is “I can’t believe you didn’t rescue Peeta.”“I know,” he replies.There’s a sense of incompleteness. And not because he hasn’t apologized. Butbecause we were a team. We had a deal to keep Peeta safe. A drunken, unrealisticdeal made in the dark of night, but a deal just the same. And in my heart ofhearts, I know we both failed.“Now you say it,” I tell him.“I can’t believe you let him out of your sight that night,” says Haymitch.I nod. That’s it. “I play it over and over in my head. What I could have done tokeep him by my side without breaking the alliance. But nothing comes to me.”“You didn’t have a choice. And even if I could’ve made Plutarch stay and rescuehim that night, the whole hovercraft would’ve gone down. We barely got out as itwas.” I finally meet Haymitch’s eyes. Seam eyes. Gray and deep and ringed withthe circles of sleepless nights. “He’s not dead yet, Katniss.”“We’re still in the game.” I try to say this with optimism, but my voice cracks.“Still in. And I’m still your mentor.” Haymitch points his marker at me. “Whenyou’re on the ground, remember I’m airborne. I’ll have the better view, so dowhat I tell you.”“We’ll see,” I answer.I return to the Remake Room and watch the streaks of makeup disappear down thedrain as I scrub my face clean. The person in the mirror looks ragged, with heruneven skin and tired eyes, but she looks like me. I rip the armband off,revealing the ugly scar from the tracker. There. That looks like me, too.Since I’ll be in a combat zone, Beetee helps me with armor Cinna designed. Ahelmet of some interwoven metal that fits close to my head. The material’ssupple, like fabric, and can be drawn back like a hood in case I don’t want itup full-time. A vest to reinforce the protection over my vital organs. A smallwhite earpiece that attaches to my collar by a wire. Beetee secures a mask to mybelt that I don’t have to wear unless there’s a gas attack. “If you see anyonedropping for reasons you can’t explain, put it on immediately,” he says.Finally, he straps a sheath divided into three cylinders of arrows to my back.“Just remember: Right side, fire. Left side, explosive. Center, regular. Youshouldn’t need them, but better safe than sorry.”Boggs shows up to escort me down to the Airborne Division. Just as the elevatorarrives, Finnick appears in a state of agitation. “Katniss, they won’t let mego! I told them I’m fine, but they won’t even let me ride in the hovercraft!”I take in Finnick—his bare legs showing between his hospital gown and slippers,his tangle of hair, the half-knotted rope twisted around his fingers, the wildlook in his eyes—and know any plea on my part will be useless. Even I don’tthink it’s a good idea to bring him. So I smack my hand on my forehead and say,“Oh, I forgot. It’s this stupid concussion. I was supposed to tell you to reportto Beetee in Special Weaponry. He’s designed a new trident for you.”At the word trident, it’s as if the old Finnick surfaces. “Really? What’s itdo?”“I don’t know. But if it’s anything like my bow and arrows, you’re going to loveit,” I say. “You’ll need to train with it, though.”“Right. Of course. I guess I better get down there,” he says.“Finnick?” I say. “Maybe some pants?”He looks down at his legs as if noticing his outfit for the first time. Then hewhips off his hospital gown, leaving him in just his underwear. “Why? Do youfind this”—he strikes a ridiculously provocative pose—“distracting?”I can’t help laughing because it’s funny, and it’s extra funny because it makesBoggs look so uncomfortable, and I’m happy because Finnick actually sounds likethe guy I met at the Quarter Quell.“I’m only human, Odair.” I get in before the elevator doors close. “Sorry,” Isay to Boggs.“Don’t be. I thought you…handled that well,” he says. “Better than my having toarrest him, anyway.”“Yeah,” I say. I sneak a sidelong glance at him. He’s probably in hismid-forties, with close-cropped gray hair and blue eyes. Incredible posture.He’s spoken out twice today in ways that make me think he would rather befriends than enemies. Maybe I should give him a chance. But he just seems so instep with Coin….There’s a series of loud clicks. The elevator comes to a slight pause and thenbegins to move laterally to the left. “It goes sideways?” I ask.“Yes. There’s a whole network of elevator paths under Thirteen,” he answers.“This one lies just above the transport spoke to the fifth airlift platform.It’s taking us to the Hangar.”The Hangar. The dungeons. Special Defense. Somewhere food is grown. Powergenerated. Air and water purified. “Thirteen is even larger than I thought.”“Can’t take credit for much of it,” says Boggs. “We basically inherited theplace. It’s been all we can do to keep it running.”The clicks resume. We drop down again briefly—just a couple of levels—and thedoors open on the Hangar.“Oh,” I let out involuntarily at the sight of the fleet. Row after row ofdifferent kinds of hovercraft. “Did you inherit these, too?”“Some we manufactured. Some were part of the Capitol’s air force. They’ve beenupdated, of course,” says Boggs.I feel that twinge of hatred against 13 again. “So, you had all this, and youleft the rest of the districts defenseless against the Capitol.”“It’s not that simple,” he shoots back. “We were in no position to launch acounterattack until recently. We could barely stay alive. After we’d overthrownand executed the Capitol’s people, only a handful of us even knew how to pilot.We could’ve nuked them with missiles, yes. But there’s always the largerquestion: If we engage in that type of war with the Capitol, would there be anyhuman life left?”“That sounds like what Peeta said. And you all called him a traitor,” I counter.“Because he called for a cease-fire,” says Boggs. “You’ll notice neither sidehas launched nuclear weapons. We’re working it out the old-fashioned way. Overhere, Soldier Everdeen.” He indicates one of the smaller hovercraft.I mount the stairs and find it packed with the television crew and equipment.Everyone else is dressed in 13’s dark gray military jumpsuits, even Haymitch,although he seems unhappy about the snugness of his collar.Fulvia Cardew hustles over and makes a sound of frustration when she sees myclean face. “All that work, down the drain. I’m not blaming you, Katniss. It’sjust that very few people are born with camera-ready faces. Like him.” She snagsGale, who’s in a conversation with Plutarch, and spins him toward us. “Isn’t hehandsome?”Gale does look striking in the uniform, I guess. But the question justembarrasses us both, given our history. I’m trying to think of a witty comeback,when Boggs says brusquely, “Well, don’t expect us to be too impressed. We justsaw Finnick Odair in his underwear.” I decide to go ahead and like Boggs.There’s a warning of the upcoming takeoff and I strap myself into a seat next toGale, facing off with Haymitch and Plutarch. We glide through a maze of tunnelsthat opens out onto a platform. Some sort of elevator device lifts the craftslowly up through the levels. All at once we’re outside in a large fieldsurrounded by woods, then we rise off the platform and become wrapped in clouds.Now that the flurry of activity leading up to this mission is over, I realize Ihave no idea what I’m facing on this trip to District 8. In fact, I know verylittle about the actual state of the war. Or what it would take to win it. Orwhat would happen if we did.Plutarch tries to lay it out in simple terms for me. First of all, everydistrict is currently at war with the Capitol except 2, which has always had afavored relationship with our enemies despite its participation in the HungerGames. They get more food and better living conditions. After the Dark Days andthe supposed destruction of 13, District 2 became the Capitol’s new center ofdefense, although it’s publicly presented as the home of the nation’s stonequarries, in the same way that 13 was known for graphite mining. District 2 notonly manufactures weaponry, it trains and even supplies Peacekeepers.“You mean…some of the Peacekeepers are born in Two?” I ask. “I thought they allcame from the Capitol.”Plutarch nods. “That’s what you’re supposed to think. And some do come from theCapitol. But its population could never sustain a force that size. Then there’sthe problem of recruiting Capitol-raised citizens for a dull life of deprivationin the districts. A twenty-year commitment to the Peacekeepers, no marriage, nochildren allowed. Some buy into it for the honor of the thing, others take it onas an alternative to punishment. For instance, join the Peacekeepers and yourdebts are forgiven. Many people are swamped in debt in the Capitol, but not allof them are fit for military duty. So District Two is where we turn foradditional troops. It’s a way for their people to escape poverty and a life inthe quarries. They’re raised with a warrior mind-set. You’ve seen how eagertheir children are to volunteer to be tributes.”Cato and Clove. Brutus and Enobaria. I’ve seen their eagerness and theirbloodlust, too. “But all the other districts are on our side?” I ask.“Yes. Our goal is to take over the districts one by one, ending with DistrictTwo, thus cutting off the Capitol’s supply chain. Then, once it’s weakened, weinvade the Capitol itself,” says Plutarch. “That will be a whole other type ofchallenge. But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.”“If we win, who would be in charge of the government?” Gale asks.“Everyone,” Plutarch tells him. “We’re going to form a republic where the peopleof each district and the Capitol can elect their own representatives to be theirvoice in a centralized government. Don’t look so suspicious; it’s workedbefore.”“In books,” Haymitch mutters.“In history books,” says Plutarch. “And if our ancestors could do it, then wecan, too.”Frankly, our ancestors don’t seem much to brag about. I mean, look at the statethey left us in, with the wars and the broken planet. Clearly, they didn’t careabout what would happen to the people who came after them. But this republicidea sounds like an improvement over our current government.“And if we lose?” I ask.“If we lose?” Plutarch looks out at the clouds, and an ironic smile twists hislips. “Then I would expect next year’s Hunger Games to be quite unforgettable.That reminds me.” He takes a vial from his vest, shakes a few deep violet pillsinto his hand, and holds them out to us. “We named them nightlock in your honor,Katniss. The rebels can’t afford for any of us to be captured now. But Ipromise, it will be completely painless.”I take hold of a capsule, unsure of where to put it. Plutarch taps a spot on myshoulder at the front of my left sleeve. I examine it and find a tiny pocketthat both secures and conceals the pill. Even if my hands were tied, I couldlean my head forward and bite it free.Cinna, it seems, has thought of everything."},{"pageContent":"7 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_07]The hovercraft makes a quick, spiral descent onto a wide road on the outskirtsof 8. Almost immediately, the door opens, the stairs slide into place, and we’respit out onto the asphalt. The moment the last person disembarks, the equipmentretracts. Then the craft lifts off and vanishes. I’m left with a bodyguard madeup of Gale, Boggs, and two other soldiers. The TV crew consists of a pair ofburly Capitol cameramen with heavy mobile cameras encasing their bodies likeinsect shells, a woman director named Cressida who has a shaved head tattooedwith green vines, and her assistant, Messalla, a slim young man with severalsets of earrings. On careful observation, I see his tongue has been pierced,too, and he wears a stud with a silver ball the size of a marble.Boggs hustles us off the road toward a row of warehouses as a second hovercraftcomes in for a landing. This one brings crates of medical supplies and a crew ofsix medics—I can tell by their distinctive white outfits. We all follow Boggsdown an alley that runs between two dull gray warehouses. Only the occasionalaccess ladder to the roof interrupts the scarred metal walls. When we emergeonto the street, it’s like we’ve entered another world.The wounded from this morning’s bombing are being brought in. On homemadestretchers, in wheelbarrows, on carts, slung across shoulders, and clenchedtight in arms. Bleeding, limbless, unconscious. Propelled by desperate people toa warehouse with a sloppily painted H above the doorway. It’s a scene from myold kitchen, where my mother treated the dying, multiplied by ten, by fifty, bya hundred. I had expected bombed-out buildings and instead find myselfconfronted with broken human bodies.This is where they plan on filming me? I turn to Boggs. “This won’t work,” Isay. “I won’t be good here.”He must see the panic in my eyes, because he stops a moment and places his handson my shoulders. “You will. Just let them see you. That will do more for themthan any doctor in the world could.”A woman directing the incoming patients catches sight of us, does a sort ofdouble take, and then strides over. Her dark brown eyes are puffy with fatigueand she smells of metal and sweat. A bandage around her throat needed changingabout three days ago. The strap of the automatic weapon slung across her backdigs into her neck and she shifts her shoulder to reposition it. With a jerk ofher thumb, she orders the medics into the warehouse. They comply withoutquestion.“This is Commander Paylor of Eight,” says Boggs. “Commander, Soldier KatnissEverdeen.”She looks young to be a commander. Early thirties. But there’s an authoritativetone to her voice that makes you feel her appointment wasn’t arbitrary. Besideher, in my spanking-new outfit, scrubbed and shiny, I feel like a recentlyhatched chick, untested and only just learning how to navigate the world.“Yeah, I know who she is,” says Paylor. “You’re alive, then. We weren’t sure.”Am I wrong or is there a note of accusation in her voice?“I’m still not sure myself,” I answer.“Been in recovery.” Boggs taps his head. “Bad concussion.” He lowers his voice amoment. “Miscarriage. But she insisted on coming by to see your wounded.”“Well, we’ve got plenty of those,” says Paylor.“You think this is a good idea?” says Gale, frowning at the hospital.“Assembling your wounded like this?”I don’t. Any sort of contagious disease would spread through this place likewildfire.“I think it’s slightly better than leaving them to die,” says Paylor.“That’s not what I meant,” Gale tells her.“Well, currently that’s my other option. But if you come up with a third and getCoin to back it, I’m all ears.” Paylor waves me toward the door. “Come on in,Mockingjay. And by all means, bring your friends.”I glance back at the freak show that is my crew, steel myself, and follow herinto the hospital. Some sort of heavy, industrial curtain hangs the length ofthe building, forming a sizable corridor. Corpses lie side by side, curtainbrushing their heads, white cloths concealing their faces. “We’ve got a massgrave started a few blocks west of here, but I can’t spare the manpower to movethem yet,” says Paylor. She finds a slit in the curtain and opens it wide.My fingers wrap around Gale’s wrist. “Do not leave my side,” I say under mybreath.“I’m right here,” he answers quietly.I step through the curtain and my senses are assaulted. My first impulse is tocover my nose to block out the stench of soiled linen, putrefying flesh, andvomit, all ripening in the heat of the warehouse. They’ve propped open skylightsthat crisscross the high metal roof, but any air that’s managing to get in can’tmake a dent in the fog below. The thin shafts of sunlight provide the onlyillumination, and as my eyes adjust, I can make out row upon row of wounded, incots, on pallets, on the floor because there are so many to claim the space. Thedrone of black flies, the moaning of people in pain, and the sobs of theirattending loved ones have combined into a wrenching chorus.We have no real hospitals in the districts. We die at home, which at the momentseems a far desirable alternative to what lies in front of me. Then I rememberthat many of these people probably lost their homes in the bombings.Sweat begins to run down my back, fill my palms. I breathe through my mouth inan attempt to diminish the smell. Black spots swim across my field of vision,and I think there’s a really good chance I could faint. But then I catch sightof Paylor, who’s watching me so closely, waiting to see what I am made of, andif any of them have been right to think they can count on me. So I let go ofGale and force myself to move deeper into the warehouse, to walk into the narrowstrip between two rows of beds.“Katniss?” a voice croaks out from my left, breaking apart from the general din.“Katniss?” A hand reaches for me out of the haze. I cling to it for support.Attached to the hand is a young woman with an injured leg. Blood has seepedthrough the heavy bandages, which are crawling with flies. Her face reflects herpain, but something else, too, something that seems completely incongruous withher situation. “Is it really you?”“Yeah, it’s me,” I get out.Joy. That’s the expression on her face. At the sound of my voice, it brightens,erases the suffering momentarily.“You’re alive! We didn’t know. People said you were, but we didn’t know!” shesays excitedly.“I got pretty banged up. But I got better,” I say. “Just like you will.”“I’ve got to tell my brother!” The woman struggles to sit up and calls tosomeone a few beds down. “Eddy! Eddy! She’s here! It’s Katniss Everdeen!”A boy, probably about twelve years old, turns to us. Bandages obscure half ofhis face. The side of his mouth I can see opens as if to utter an exclamation. Igo to him, push his damp brown curls back from his forehead. Murmur a greeting.He can’t speak, but his one good eye fixes on me with such intensity, as if he’strying to memorize every detail of my face.I hear my name rippling through the hot air, spreading out into the hospital.“Katniss! Katniss Everdeen!” The sounds of pain and grief begin to recede, to bereplaced by words of anticipation. From all sides, voices beckon me. I begin tomove, clasping the hands extended to me, touching the sound parts of thoseunable to move their limbs, saying hello, how are you, good to meet you. Nothingof importance, no amazing words of inspiration. But it doesn’t matter. Boggs isright. It’s the sight of me, alive, that is the inspiration.Hungry fingers devour me, wanting to feel my flesh. As a stricken man clutchesmy face between his hands, I send a silent thank-you to Dalton for suggesting Iwash off the makeup. How ridiculous, how perverse I would feel presenting thatpainted Capitol mask to these people. The damage, the fatigue, theimperfections. That’s how they recognize me, why I belong to them.Despite his controversial interview with Caesar, many ask about Peeta, assure methat they know he was speaking under duress. I do my best to sound positiveabout our future, but people are truly devastated when they learn I’ve lost thebaby. I want to come clean and tell one weeping woman that it was all a hoax, amove in the game, but to present Peeta as a liar now would not help his image.Or mine. Or the cause.I begin to fully understand the lengths to which people have gone to protect me.What I mean to the rebels. My ongoing struggle against the Capitol, which has sooften felt like a solitary journey, has not been undertaken alone. I have hadthousands upon thousands of people from the districts at my side. I was theirMockingjay long before I accepted the role.A new sensation begins to germinate inside me. But it takes until I am standingon a table, waving my final goodbyes to the hoarse chanting of my name, todefine it. Power. I have a kind of power I never knew I possessed. Snow knew it,as soon as I held out those berries. Plutarch knew when he rescued me from thearena. And Coin knows now. So much so that she must publicly remind her peoplethat I am not in control.When we’re outside again, I lean against the warehouse, catching my breath,accepting the canteen of water from Boggs. “You did great,” he says.Well, I didn’t faint or throw up or run out screaming. Mostly, I just rode thewave of emotion rolling through the place.“We got some nice stuff in there,” says Cressida. I look at the insectcameramen, perspiration pouring from under their equipment. Messalla scribblingnotes. I had forgotten they were even filming me.“I didn’t do much, really,” I say.“You have to give yourself some credit for what you’ve done in the past,” saysBoggs.What I’ve done in the past? I think of the trail of destruction in my wake—myknees weaken and I slide down to a sitting position. “That’s a mixed bag.”“Well, you’re not perfect by a long shot. But times being what they are, you’llhave to do,” says Boggs.Gale squats down beside me, shaking his head. “I can’t believe you let all thosepeople touch you. I kept expecting you to make a break for the door.”“Shut up,” I say with a laugh.“Your mother’s going to be very proud when she sees the footage,” he says.“My mother won’t even notice me. She’ll be too appalled by the conditions inthere.” I turn to Boggs and ask, “Is it like this in every district?”“Yes. Most are under attack. We’re trying to get in aid wherever we can, butit’s not enough.” He stops a minute, distracted by something in his earpiece. Irealize I haven’t heard Haymitch’s voice once, and fiddle with mine, wonderingif it’s broken. “We’re to get to the airstrip. Immediately,” Boggs says, liftingme to my feet with one hand. “There’s a problem.”“What kind of problem?” asks Gale.“Incoming bombers,” says Boggs. He reaches behind my neck and yanks Cinna’shelmet up onto my head. “Let’s move!”Unsure of what’s going on, I take off running along the front of the warehouse,heading for the alley that leads to the airstrip. But I don’t sense anyimmediate threat. The sky’s an empty, cloudless blue. The street’s clear exceptfor the people hauling the wounded to the hospital. There’s no enemy, no alarm.Then the sirens begin to wail. Within seconds, a low-flying V-shaped formationof Capitol hoverplanes appears above us, and the bombs begin to fall. I’m blownoff my feet, into the front wall of the warehouse. There’s a searing pain justabove the back of my right knee. Something has struck my back as well, butdoesn’t seem to have penetrated my vest. I try to get up, but Boggs pushes meback down, shielding my body with his own. The ground ripples under me as bombafter bomb drops from the planes and detonates.It’s a horrifying sensation being pinned against the wall as the bombs raindown. What was that expression my father used for easy kills? Like shooting fishin a barrel. We are the fish, the street the barrel.“Katniss!” I’m startled by Haymitch’s voice in my ear.“What? Yes, what? I’m here!” I answer.“Listen to me. We can’t land during the bombing, but it’s imperative you’re notspotted,” he says.“So they don’t know I’m here?” I assumed, as usual, it was my presence thatbrought on punishment.“Intelligence thinks no. That this raid was already scheduled,” says Haymitch.Now Plutarch’s voice comes up, calm but forceful. The voice of a Head Gamemakerused to calling the shots under pressure. “There’s a light blue warehouse threedown from you. It has a bunker in the far north corner. Can you get there?”“We’ll do our best,” says Boggs. Plutarch must be in everyone’s ear, because mybodyguards and crew are getting up. My eye instinctively searches for Gale andsees he’s on his feet, apparently unharmed.“You’ve got maybe forty-five seconds to the next wave,” says Plutarch.I give a grunt of pain as my right leg takes the weight of my body, but I keepmoving. No time to examine the injury. Better not to look now, anyway.Fortunately, I have on shoes that Cinna designed. They grip the asphalt oncontact and spring free of it on release. I’d be hopeless in that ill-fittingpair that 13 assigned to me. Boggs has the lead, but no one else passes me.Instead they match my pace, protecting my sides, my back. I force myself into asprint as the seconds tick away. We pass the second gray warehouse and run alonga dirt brown building. Up ahead, I see a faded blue facade. Home of the bunker.We have just reached another alley, need only to cross it to arrive at the door,when the next wave of bombs begins. I instinctively dive into the alley and rolltoward the blue wall. This time it’s Gale who throws himself over me to provideone more layer of protection from the bombing. It seems to go on longer thistime, but we are farther away.I shift onto my side and find myself looking directly into Gale’s eyes. For aninstant the world recedes and there is just his flushed face, his pulse visibleat his temple, his lips slightly parted as he tries to catch his breath.“You all right?” he asks, his words nearly drowned out by an explosion.“Yeah. I don’t think they’ve seen me,” I answer. “I mean, they’re not followingus.”“No, they’ve targeted something else,” says Gale.“I know, but there’s nothing back there but—” The realization hits us at thesame time.“The hospital.” Instantly, Gale’s up and shouting to the others. “They’retargeting the hospital!”“Not your problem,” says Plutarch firmly. “Get to the bunker.”“But there’s nothing there but the wounded!” I say.“Katniss.” I hear the warning note in Haymitch’s voice and know what’s coming.“Don’t you even think about—!” I yank the earpiece free and let it hang from itswire. With that distraction gone, I hear another sound. Machine gun fire comingfrom the roof of the dirt brown warehouse across the alley. Someone is returningfire. Before anyone can stop me, I make a dash for an access ladder and begin toscale it. Climbing. One of the things I do best.“Don’t stop!” I hear Gale say behind me. Then there’s the sound of his boot onsomeone’s face. If it belongs to Boggs, Gale’s going to pay for it dearly lateron. I make the roof and drag myself onto the tar. I stop long enough to pullGale up beside me, and then we take off for the row of machine gun nests on thestreet side of the warehouse. Each looks to be manned by a few rebels. We skidinto a nest with a pair of soldiers, hunching down behind the barrier.“Boggs know you’re up here?” To my left I see Paylor behind one of the guns,looking at us quizzically.I try to be evasive without flat-out lying. “He knows where we are, all right.”Paylor laughs. “I bet he does. You been trained in these?” She slaps the stockof her gun.“I have. In Thirteen,” says Gale. “But I’d rather use my own weapons.”“Yes, we’ve got our bows.” I hold mine up, then realize how decorative it mustseem. “It’s more deadly than it looks.”“It would have to be,” says Paylor. “All right. We expect at least three morewaves. They have to drop their sight shields before they release the bombs.That’s our chance. Stay low!” I position myself to shoot from one knee.“Better start with fire,” says Gale.I nod and pull an arrow from my right sheath. If we miss our targets, thesearrows will land somewhere—probably the warehouses across the street. A fire canbe put out, but the damage an explosive can do may be irreparable.Suddenly, they appear in the sky, two blocks down, maybe a hundred yards aboveus. Seven small bombers in a V formation. “Geese!” I yell at Gale. He’ll knowexactly what I mean. During migration season, when we hunt fowl, we’ve developeda system of dividing the birds so we don’t both target the same ones. I get thefar side of the V, Gale takes the near, and we alternate shots at the frontbird. There’s no time for further discussion. I estimate the lead time on thehoverplanes and let my arrow fly. I catch the inside wing of one, causing it toburst into flames. Gale just misses the point plane. A fire blooms on an emptywarehouse roof across from us. He swears under his breath.The hoverplane I hit swerves out of formation, but still releases its bombs. Itdoesn’t disappear, though. Neither does one other I assume was hit by gunfire.The damage must prevent the sight shield from reactivating.“Good shot,” says Gale.“I wasn’t even aiming for that one,” I mutter. I’d set my sights on the plane infront of it. “They’re faster than we think.”“Positions!” Paylor shouts. The next wave of hoverplanes is appearing already.“Fire’s no good,” Gale says. I nod and we both load explosive-tipped arrows.Those warehouses across the way look deserted anyway.As the planes sweep silently in, I make another decision. “I’m standing!” Ishout to Gale, and rise to my feet. This is the position I get the best accuracyfrom. I lead earlier and score a direct hit on the point plane, blasting a holein its belly. Gale blows the tail off a second. It flips and crashes into thestreet, setting off a series of explosions as its cargo goes off.Without warning, a third V formation unveils. This time, Gale squarely hits thepoint plane. I take the wing off the second bomber, causing it to spin into theone behind it. Together they collide into the roof of the warehouse across fromthe hospital. A fourth goes down from gunfire.“All right, that’s it,” Paylor says.Flames and heavy black smoke from the wreckage obscure our view. “Did they hitthe hospital?”“Must have,” she says grimly.As I hurry toward the ladders at the far end of the warehouse, the sight ofMessalla and one of the insects emerging from behind an air duct surprises me. Ithought they’d still be hunkered down in the alley.“They’re growing on me,” says Gale.I scramble down a ladder. When my feet hit the ground, I find a bodyguard,Cressida, and the other insect waiting. I expect resistance, but Cressida justwaves me toward the hospital. She’s yelling, “I don’t care, Plutarch! Just giveme five more minutes!” Not one to question a free pass, I take off into thestreet.“Oh, no,” I whisper as I catch sight of the hospital. What used to be thehospital. I move past the wounded, past the burning plane wrecks, fixated on thedisaster ahead of me. People screaming, running about frantically, but unable tohelp. The bombs have collapsed the hospital roof and set the building on fire,effectively trapping the patients within. A group of rescuers has assembled,trying to clear a path to the inside. But I already know what they will find. Ifthe crushing debris and the flames didn’t get them, the smoke did.Gale’s at my shoulder. The fact that he does nothing only confirms mysuspicions. Miners don’t abandon an accident until it’s hopeless.“Come on, Katniss. Haymitch says they can get a hovercraft in for us now,” hetells me. But I can’t seem to move.“Why would they do that? Why would they target people who were already dying?” Iask him.“Scare others off. Prevent the wounded from seeking help,” says Gale. “Thosepeople you met, they were expendable. To Snow, anyway. If the Capitol wins, whatwill it do with a bunch of damaged slaves?”I remember all those years in the woods, listening to Gale rant against theCapitol. Me, not paying close attention. Wondering why he even bothered todissect its motives. Why thinking like our enemy would ever matter. Clearly, itcould have mattered today. When Gale questioned the existence of the hospital,he was not thinking of disease, but this. Because he never underestimates thecruelty of those we face.I slowly turn my back to the hospital and find Cressida, flanked by the insects,standing a couple of yards in front of me. Her manner’s unrattled. Cool even.“Katniss,” she says, “President Snow just had them air the bombing live. Then hemade an appearance to say that this was his way of sending a message to therebels. What about you? Would you like to tell the rebels anything?”“Yes,” I whisper. The red blinking light on one of the cameras catches my eye. Iknow I’m being recorded. “Yes,” I say more forcefully. Everyone is drawing awayfrom me—Gale, Cressida, the insects—giving me the stage. But I stay focused onthe red light. “I want to tell the rebels that I am alive. That I’m right herein District Eight, where the Capitol has just bombed a hospital full of unarmedmen, women, and children. There will be no survivors.” The shock I’ve beenfeeling begins to give way to fury. “I want to tell people that if you think forone second the Capitol will treat us fairly if there’s a cease-fire, you’redeluding yourself. Because you know who they are and what they do.” My hands goout automatically, as if to indicate the whole horror around me. “This is whatthey do! And we must fight back!”I’m moving in toward the camera now, carried forward by my rage. “President Snowsays he’s sending us a message? Well, I have one for him. You can torture us andbomb us and burn our districts to the ground, but do you see that?” One of thecameras follows as I point to the planes burning on the roof of the warehouseacross from us. The Capitol seal on a wing glows clearly through the flames.“Fire is catching!” I am shouting now, determined that he will not miss a word.“And if we burn, you burn with us!”My last words hang in the air. I feel suspended in time. Held aloft in a cloudof heat that generates not from my surroundings, but from my own being.“Cut!” Cressida’s voice snaps me back to reality, extinguishes me. She gives mea nod of approval. “That’s a wrap.”"},{"pageContent":"8 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_08]Boggs appears and gets a firm lock on my arm, but I’m not planning on runningnow. I look over at the hospital—just in time to see the rest of the structuregive way—and the fight goes out of me. All those people, the hundreds ofwounded, the relatives, the medics from 13, are no more. I turn back to Boggs,see the swelling on his face left by Gale’s boot. I’m no expert, but I’m prettysure his nose is broken. His voice is more resigned than angry, though. “Back tothe landing strip.” I obediently take a step forward and wince as I become awareof the pain behind my right knee. The adrenaline rush that overrode thesensation has passed and my body parts join in a chorus of complaints. I’mbanged up and bloody and someone seems to be hammering on my left temple frominside my skull. Boggs quickly examines my face, then scoops me up and jogs forthe runway. Halfway there, I puke on his bulletproof vest. It’s hard to tellbecause he’s short of breath, but I think he sighs.A small hovercraft, different from the one that transported us here, waits onthe runway. The second my team’s on board, we take off. No comfy seats andwindows this time. We seem to be in some sort of cargo craft. Boggs doesemergency first aid on people to hold them until we get back to 13. I want totake off my vest, since I got a fair amount of vomit on it as well, but it’s toocold to think about it. I lie on the floor with my head in Gale’s lap. The lastthing I remember is Boggs spreading a couple of burlap sacks over me.When I wake up, I’m warm and patched up in my old bed in the hospital. Mymother’s there, checking my vital signs. “How do you feel?”“A little beat-up, but all right,” I say.“No one even told us you were going until you were gone,” she says.I feel a pang of guilt. When your family’s had to send you off twice to theHunger Games, this isn’t the kind of detail you should overlook. “I’m sorry.They weren’t expecting the attack. I was just supposed to be visiting thepatients,” I explain. “Next time, I’ll have them clear it with you.”“Katniss, no one clears anything with me,” she says.It’s true. Even I don’t. Not since my father died. Why pretend? “Well, I’ll havethem…notify you anyway.”On the bedside table is a piece of shrapnel they removed from my leg. Thedoctors are more concerned with the damage my brain might have suffered from theexplosions, since my concussion hadn’t fully healed to begin with. But I don’thave double vision or anything and I can think clearly enough. I’ve slept rightthrough the late afternoon and night, and I’m starving. My breakfast isdisappointingly small. Just a few cubes of bread soaking in warm milk. I’ve beencalled down to an early morning meeting at Command. I start to get up and thenrealize they plan to roll my hospital bed directly there. I want to walk, butthat’s out, so I negotiate my way into a wheelchair. I feel fine, really. Exceptfor my head, and my leg, and the soreness from the bruises, and the nausea thathit a couple minutes after I ate. Maybe the wheelchair’s a good idea.As they wheel me down, I begin to get uneasy about what I will face. Gale and Idirectly disobeyed orders yesterday, and Boggs has the injury to prove it.Surely, there will be repercussions, but will they go so far as Coin annullingour agreement for the victors’ immunity? Have I stripped Peeta of what littleprotection I could give him?When I get to Command, the only ones who’ve arrived are Cressida, Messalla, andthe insects. Messalla beams and says, “There’s our little star!” and the othersare smiling so genuinely that I can’t help but smile in return. They impressedme in 8, following me onto the roof during the bombing, making Plutarch back offso they could get the footage they wanted. They more than do their work, theytake pride in it. Like Cinna.I have a strange thought that if we were in the arena together, I would pickthem as allies. Cressida, Messalla, and—and—“I have to stop calling you ‘theinsects,’” I blurt out to the cameramen. I explain how I didn’t know theirnames, but their suits suggested the shelled creatures. The comparison doesn’tseem to bother them. Even without the camera shells, they strongly resemble eachother. Same sandy hair, red beards, and blue eyes. The one with close-bittennails introduces himself as Castor and the other, who’s his brother, as Pollux.I wait for Pollux to say hello, but he just nods. At first I think he’s shy or aman of few words. But something tugs on me—the position of his lips, the extraeffort he takes to swallow—and I know before Castor tells me. Pollux is an Avox.They have cut out his tongue and he will never speak again. And I no longer haveto wonder what made him risk everything to help bring down the Capitol.As the room fills, I brace myself for a less congenial reception. But the onlypeople who register any kind of negativity are Haymitch, who’s always out ofsorts, and a sour-faced Fulvia Cardew. Boggs wears a flesh-colored plastic maskfrom his upper lip to his brow—I was right about the broken nose—so hisexpression’s hard to read. Coin and Gale are in the midst of some exchange thatseems positively chummy.When Gale slides into the seat next to my wheelchair, I say, “Making newfriends?”His eyes flicker to the president and back. “Well, one of us has to beaccessible.” He touches my temple gently. “How do you feel?”They must have served stewed garlic and squash for the breakfast vegetable. Themore people who gather, the stronger the fumes are. My stomach turns and thelights suddenly seem too bright. “Kind of rocky,” I say. “How are you?”“Fine. They dug out a couple of pieces of shrapnel. No big deal,” he says.Coin calls the meeting to order. “Our Airtime Assault has officially launched.For any of you who missed yesterday’s twenty-hundred broadcast of our firstpropo—or the seventeen reruns Beetee has managed to air since—we will begin byreplaying it.” Replaying it? So they not only got usable footage, they’vealready slapped together a propo and aired it repeatedly. My palms grow moist inanticipation of seeing myself on television. What if I’m still awful? What ifI’m as stiff and pointless as I was in the studio and they’ve just given up ongetting anything better? Individual screens slide up from the table, the lightsdim slightly, and a hush falls over the room.At first, my screen is black. Then a tiny spark flickers in the center. Itblossoms, spreads, silently eating up the blackness until the entire frame isablaze with a fire so real and intense, I imagine I feel the heat emanating fromit. The image of my mockingjay pin emerges, glowing red-gold. The deep, resonantvoice that haunts my dreams begins to speak. Claudius Templesmith, the officialannouncer of the Hunger Games, says, “Katniss Everdeen, the girl who was onfire, burns on.”Suddenly, there I am, replacing the mockingjay, standing before the real flamesand smoke of District 8. “I want to tell the rebels that I am alive. That I’mright here in District Eight, where the Capitol has just bombed a hospital fullof unarmed men, women, and children. There will be no survivors.” Cut to thehospital collapsing in on itself, the desperation of the onlookers as I continuein voice-over. “I want to tell people that if you think for one second theCapitol will treat us fairly if there’s a cease-fire, you’re deluding yourself.Because you know who they are and what they do.” Back to me now, my handslifting up to indicate the outrage around me. “This is what they do! And we mustfight back!” Now comes a truly fantastic montage of the battle. The initialbombs falling, us running, being blown to the ground—a close-up of my wound,which looks good and bloody—scaling the roof, diving into the nests, and thensome amazing shots of the rebels, Gale, and mostly me, me, me knocking thoseplanes out of the sky. Smash-cut back to me moving in on the camera. “PresidentSnow says he’s sending us a message? Well, I have one for him. You can tortureus and bomb us and burn our districts to the ground, but do you see that?” We’rewith the camera, tracking to the planes burning on the roof of the warehouse.Tight on the Capitol seal on a wing, which melts back into the image of my face,shouting at the president. “Fire is catching! And if we burn, you burn with us!”Flames engulf the screen again. Superimposed on them in black, solid letters arethe words: IF WE BURN YOUBURN WITH US The words catch fire and the whole screen burns to blackness.There’s a moment of silent relish, then applause followed by demands to see itagain. Coin indulgently hits the replay button, and this time, since I know whatwill happen, I try to pretend that I’m watching this on my television at home inthe Seam. An anti-Capitol statement. There’s never been anything like it ontelevision. Not in my lifetime, anyway.By the time the screen burns to black a second time, I need to know more. “Didit play all over Panem? Did they see it in the Capitol?”“Not in the Capitol,” says Plutarch. “We couldn’t override their system,although Beetee’s working on it. But in all the districts. We even got it on inTwo, which may be more valuable than the Capitol at this point in the game.”“Is Claudius Templesmith with us?” I ask.This gives Plutarch a good laugh. “Only his voice. But that’s ours for thetaking. We didn’t even have to do any special editing. He said that actual linein your first Games.” He slaps his hand on the table. “What say we give anotherround of applause to Cressida, her amazing team, and, of course, our on-cameratalent!”I clap, too, until I realize I’m the on-camera talent and maybe it’s obnoxiousthat I’m applauding for myself, but no one’s paying attention. I can’t helpnoticing the strain on Fulvia’s face, though. I think how hard this must be forher, watching Haymitch’s idea succeed under Cressida’s direction, when Fulvia’sstudio approach was such a flop.Coin seems to have reached the end of her tolerance for self-congratulation.“Yes, well deserved. The result is more than we had hoped for. But I do have toquestion the wide margin of risk that you were willing to operate within. I knowthe raid was unforeseen. However, given the circumstances, I think we shoulddiscuss the decision to send Katniss into actual combat.”The decision? To send me into combat? Then she doesn’t know that I flagrantlydisregarded orders, ripped out my earpiece, and gave my bodyguards the slip?What else have they kept from her?“It was a tough call,” says Plutarch, furrowing his brow. “But the generalconsensus was that we weren’t going to get anything worth using if we locked herin a bunker somewhere every time a gun went off.”“And you’re all right with that?” asks the president.Gale has to kick me under the table before I realize that she’s talking to me.“Oh! Yeah, I’m completely all right with that. It felt good. Doing something fora change.”“Well, let’s be just a little more judicious with her exposure. Especially nowthat the Capitol knows what she can do,” says Coin. There’s a rumble of assentfrom around the table.No one has ratted out Gale and me. Not Plutarch, whose authority we ignored. NotBoggs with his broken nose. Not the insects we led into fire. Not Haymitch—no,wait a minute. Haymitch is giving me a deadly smile and saying sweetly, “Yeah,we wouldn’t want to lose our little Mockingjay when she’s finally begun tosing.” I make a note to myself not to end up alone in a room with him, becausehe’s clearly having vengeful thoughts over that stupid earpiece.“So, what else do you have planned?” asks the president.Plutarch nods to Cressida, who consults a clipboard. “We have some terrificfootage of Katniss at the hospital in Eight. There should be another propo inthat with the theme ‘Because you know who they are and what they do.’ We’llfocus on Katniss interacting with the patients, particularly the children, thebombing of the hospital, and the wreckage. Messalla’s cutting that together.We’re also thinking about a Mockingjay piece. Highlight some of Katniss’s bestmoments intercut with scenes of rebel uprisings and war footage. We call thatone ‘Fire is catching.’ And then Fulvia came up with a really brilliant idea.”Fulvia’s mouthful-of-sour-grapes expression is startled right off her face, butshe recovers. “Well, I don’t know how brilliant it is, but I was thinking wecould do a series of propos called We Remember. In each one, we would featureone of the dead tributes. Little Rue from Eleven or old Mags from Four. The ideabeing that we could target each district with a very personal piece.”“A tribute to your tributes, as it were,” says Plutarch.“That is brilliant, Fulvia,” I say sincerely. “It’s the perfect way to remindpeople why they’re fighting.”“I think it could work,” she says. “I thought we might use Finnick to intro andnarrate the spots. If there was interest in them.”“Frankly, I don’t see how we could have too many We Remember propos,” says Coin.“Can you start producing them today?”“Of course,” says Fulvia, obviously mollified by the response to her idea.Cressida has smoothed everything over in the creative department with hergesture. Praised Fulvia for what is, in fact, a really good idea, and clearedthe way to continue her own on-air depiction of the Mockingjay. What’sinteresting is that Plutarch seems to have no need to share in the credit. Allhe wants is for the Airtime Assault to work. I remember that Plutarch is a HeadGamemaker, not a member of the crew. Not a piece in the Games. Therefore, hisworth is not defined by a single element, but by the overall success of theproduction. If we win the war, that’s when Plutarch will take his bow. Andexpect his reward.The president sends everyone off to get to work, so Gale wheels me back to thehospital. We laugh a little about the cover-up. Gale says no one wanted to lookbad by admitting they couldn’t control us. I’m kinder, saying they probablydidn’t want to jeopardize the chance of taking us out again now that they’vegotten some decent footage. Both things are probably true. Gale has to go meetBeetee down in Special Weaponry, so I doze off.It seems like I’ve only shut my eyes for a few minutes, but when I open them, Iflinch at the sight of Haymitch sitting a couple of feet from my bed. Waiting.Possibly for several hours if the clock is right. I think about hollering for awitness, but I’m going to have to face him sooner or later.Haymitch leans forward and dangles something on a thin white wire in front of mynose. It’s hard to focus on, but I’m pretty sure what it is. He drops it to thesheets. “That is your earpiece. I will give you exactly one more chance to wearit. If you remove it from your ear again, I’ll have you fitted with this.” Heholds up some sort of metal headgear that I instantly name the head shackle.“It’s an alternative audio unit that locks around your skull and under your chinuntil it’s opened with a key. And I’ll have the only key. If for some reasonyou’re clever enough to disable it”—Haymitch dumps the head shackle on the bedand whips out a tiny silver chip—“I’ll authorize them to surgically implant thistransmitter into your ear so that I may speak to you twenty-four hours a day.”Haymitch in my head full-time. Horrifying. “I’ll keep the earpiece in,” Imutter.“Excuse me?” he says.“I’ll keep the earpiece in!” I say, loud enough to wake up half the hospital.“You sure? Because I’m equally happy with any of the three options,” he tellsme.“I’m sure,” I say. I scrunch up the earpiece wire protectively in my fist andfling the head shackle back in his face with my free hand, but he catches iteasily. Probably was expecting me to throw it. “Anything else?”Haymitch rises to go. “While I was waiting…I ate your lunch.”My eyes take in the empty stew bowl and tray on my bed table. “I’m going toreport you,” I mumble into my pillow.“You do that, sweetheart.” He goes out, safe in the knowledge that I’m not thereporting kind.I want to go back to sleep, but I’m restless. Images from yesterday begin toflood into the present. The bombing, the fiery plane crashes, the faces of thewounded who no longer exist. I imagine death from all sides. The last momentbefore seeing a shell hit the ground, feeling the wing blown from my plane andthe dizzying nosedive into oblivion, the warehouse roof falling down at me whileI’m pinned helplessly to my cot. Things I saw, in person or on the tape. ThingsI caused with a pull of my bowstring. Things I will never be able to erase frommy memory.At dinner, Finnick brings his tray to my bed so we can watch the newest propotogether on television. He was assigned quarters on my old floor, but he has somany mental relapses, he still basically lives in the hospital. The rebels airthe “Because you know who they are and what they do” propo that Messalla edited.The footage is intercut with short studio clips of Gale, Boggs, and Cressidadescribing the incident. It’s hard to watch my reception in the hospital in 8since I know what’s coming. When the bombs rain down on the roof, I bury my facein my pillow, looking up again at a brief clip of me at the end, after all thevictims are dead.At least Finnick doesn’t applaud or act all happy when it’s done. He just says,“People should know that happened. And now they do.”“Let’s turn it off, Finnick, before they run it again,” I urge him. But asFinnick’s hand moves toward the remote control, I cry, “Wait!” The Capitol isintroducing a special segment and something about it looks familiar. Yes, it’sCaesar Flickerman. And I can guess who his guest will be.Peeta’s physical transformation shocks me. The healthy, clear-eyed boy I saw afew days ago has lost at least fifteen pounds and developed a nervous tremor inhis hands. They’ve still got him groomed. But underneath the paint that cannotcover the bags under his eyes, and the fine clothes that cannot conceal the painhe feels when he moves, is a person badly damaged.My mind reels, trying to make sense of it. I just saw him! Four—no, five—I thinkit was five days ago. How has he deteriorated so rapidly? What could theypossibly have done to him in such a short time? Then it hits me. I replay in mymind as much as I can of his first interview with Caesar, searching for anythingthat would place it in time. There is nothing. They could have taped thatinterview a day or two after I blew up the arena, then done whatever they wantedto do to him ever since. “Oh, Peeta…” I whisper.Caesar and Peeta have a few empty exchanges before Caesar asks him about rumorsthat I’m taping propos for the districts. “They’re using her, obviously,” saysPeeta. “To whip up the rebels. I doubt she even really knows what’s going on inthe war. What’s at stake.”“Is there anything you’d like to tell her?” asks Caesar.“There is,” says Peeta. He looks directly into the camera, right into my eyes.“Don’t be a fool, Katniss. Think for yourself. They’ve turned you into a weaponthat could be instrumental in the destruction of humanity. If you’ve got anyreal influence, use it to put the brakes on this thing. Use it to stop the warbefore it’s too late. Ask yourself, do you really trust the people you’reworking with? Do you really know what’s going on? And if you don’t…find out.”Black screen. Seal of Panem. Show over.Finnick presses the button on the remote that kills the power. In a minute,people will be here to do damage control on Peeta’s condition and the words thatcame out of his mouth. I will need to repudiate them. But the truth is, I don’ttrust the rebels or Plutarch or Coin. I’m not confident that they tell me thetruth. I won’t be able to conceal this. Footsteps are approaching.Finnick grips me hard by the arms. “We didn’t see it.”“What?” I ask.“We didn’t see Peeta. Only the propo on Eight. Then we turned the set offbecause the images upset you. Got it?” he asks. I nod. “Finish your dinner.” Ipull myself together enough so that when Plutarch and Fulvia enter, I have amouthful of bread and cabbage. Finnick is talking about how well Gale cameacross on camera. We congratulate them on the propo. Make it clear it was sopowerful, we tuned out right afterward. They look relieved. They believe us.No one mentions Peeta."},{"pageContent":"9 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_09]I stop trying to sleep after my first few attempts are interrupted byunspeakable nightmares. After that, I just lie still and do fake breathingwhenever someone checks on me. In the morning, I’m released from the hospitaland instructed to take it easy. Cressida asks me to record a few lines for a newMockingjay propo. At lunch, I keep waiting for people to bring up Peeta’sappearance, but no one does. Someone must have seen it besides Finnick and me.I have training, but Gale’s scheduled to work with Beetee on weapons orsomething, so I get permission to take Finnick to the woods. We wander aroundawhile and then ditch our communicators under a bush. When we’re a safe distanceaway, we sit and discuss Peeta’s broadcast.“I haven’t heard one word about it. No one’s told you anything?” Finnick says. Ishake my head. He pauses before he asks, “Not even Gale?” I’m clinging to ashred of hope that Gale honestly knows nothing about Peeta’s message. But I havea bad feeling he does. “Maybe he’s trying to find a time to tell you privately.”“Maybe,” I say.We stay silent so long that a buck wanders into range. I take it down with anarrow. Finnick hauls it back to the fence.For dinner, there’s minced venison in the stew. Gale walks me back toCompartment E after we eat. When I ask him what’s been going on, again there’sno mention of Peeta. As soon as my mother and sister are asleep, I slip thepearl from the drawer and spend a second sleepless night clutching it in myhand, replaying Peeta’s words in my head. “Ask yourself, do you really trust thepeople you’re working with? Do you really know what’s going on? And if youdon’t…find out.” Find out. What? From who? And how can Peeta know anythingexcept what the Capitol tells him? It’s just a Capitol propo. More noise. But ifPlutarch thinks it’s just the Capitol line, why didn’t he tell me about it? Whyhasn’t anyone let me or Finnick know?Under this debate lies the real source of my distress: Peeta. What have theydone to him? And what are they doing to him right now? Clearly, Snow did not buythe story that Peeta and I knew nothing about the rebellion. And his suspicionshave been reinforced, now that I have come out as the Mockingjay. Peeta can onlyguess about the rebel tactics or make up things to tell his torturers. Lies,once discovered, would be severely punished. How abandoned by me he must feel.In his first interview, he tried to protect me from the Capitol and rebelsalike, and not only have I failed to protect him, I’ve brought down more horrorsupon him.Come morning, I stick my forearm in the wall and stare groggily at the day’sschedule. Immediately after breakfast, I am slated for Production. In the dininghall, as I down my hot grain and milk and mushy beets, I spot a communicuff onGale’s wrist. “When did you get that back, Soldier Hawthorne?” I ask.“Yesterday. They thought if I’m going to be in the field with you, it could be abackup system of communication,” says Gale.No one has ever offered me a communicuff. I wonder, if I asked for one, would Iget it? “Well, I guess one of us has to be accessible,” I say with an edge to myvoice.“What’s that mean?” he says.“Nothing. Just repeating what you said,” I tell him. “And I totally agree thatthe accessible one should be you. I just hope I still have access to you aswell.”Our eyes lock, and I realize how furious I am with Gale. That I don’t believefor a second that he didn’t see Peeta’s propo. That I feel completely betrayedthat he didn’t tell me about it. We know each other too well for him not to readmy mood and guess what has caused it.“Katniss—” he begins. Already the admission of guilt is in his tone.I grab my tray, cross to the deposit area, and slam the dishes onto the rack. Bythe time I’m in the hallway, he’s caught up with me.“Why didn’t you say something?” he asks, taking my arm.“Why didn’t I?” I jerk my arm free. “Why didn’t you, Gale? And I did, by theway, when I asked you last night about what had been going on!”“I’m sorry. All right? I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to tell you, buteveryone was afraid that seeing Peeta’s propo would make you sick,” he says.“They were right. It did. But not quite as sick as you lying to me for Coin.” Atthat moment, his communicuff starts beeping. “There she is. Better run. You havethings to tell her.”For a moment, real hurt registers on his face. Then cold anger replaces it. Heturns on his heel and goes. Maybe I have been too spiteful, not given him enoughtime to explain. Maybe everyone is just trying to protect me by lying to me. Idon’t care. I’m sick of people lying to me for my own good. Because really it’smostly for their own good. Lie to Katniss about the rebellion so she doesn’t doanything crazy. Send her into the arena without a clue so we can fish her out.Don’t tell her about Peeta’s propo because it might make her sick, and it’s hardenough to get a decent performance out of her as it is.I do feel sick. Heartsick. And too tired for a day of production. But I’malready at Remake, so I go in. Today, I discover, we will be returning toDistrict 12. Cressida wants to do unscripted interviews with Gale and methrowing light on our demolished city.“If you’re both up for that,” says Cressida, looking closely at my face.“Count me in,” I say. I stand, uncommunicative and stiff, a mannequin, as myprep team dresses me, does my hair, and dabs makeup on my face. Not enough toshow, only enough to take the edge off the circles under my sleepless eyes.Boggs escorts me down to the Hangar, but we don’t talk beyond a preliminarygreeting. I’m grateful to be spared another exchange about my disobedience in 8,especially since his mask looks so uncomfortable.At the last moment, I remember to send a message to my mother about my leaving13, and stress that it won’t be dangerous. We board a hovercraft for the shortride to 12 and I’m directed to a seat at a table where Plutarch, Gale, andCressida are poring over a map. Plutarch’s brimming with satisfaction as heshows me the before/after effects of the first couple of propos. The rebels, whowere barely maintaining a foothold in several districts, have rallied. They haveactually taken 3 and 11—the latter so crucial since it’s Panem’s main foodsupplier—and have made inroads in several other districts as well.“Hopeful. Very hopeful indeed,” says Plutarch. “Fulvia’s going to have the firstround of We Remember spots ready tonight, so we can target the individualdistricts with their dead. Finnick’s absolutely marvelous.”“It’s painful to watch, actually,” says Cressida. “He knew so many of thempersonally.”“That’s what makes it so effective,” says Plutarch. “Straight from the heart.You’re all doing beautifully. Coin could not be more pleased.”Gale didn’t tell them, then. About my pretending not to see Peeta and my angerat their cover-up. But I guess it’s too little, too late, because I still can’tlet it go. It doesn’t matter. He’s not speaking to me, either.It’s not until we land in the Meadow that I realize Haymitch isn’t among ourcompany. When I ask Plutarch about his absence, he just shakes his head andsays, “He couldn’t face it.”“Haymitch? Not able to face something? Wanted a day off, more likely,” I say.“I think his actual words were ‘I couldn’t face it without a bottle,’” saysPlutarch.I roll my eyes, long out of patience with my mentor, his weakness for drink, andwhat he can or can’t confront. But about five minutes after my return to 12, I’mwishing I had a bottle myself. I thought I’d come to terms with 12’sdemise—heard of it, seen it from the air, and wandered through its ashes. So whydoes everything bring on a fresh pang of grief? Was I simply too out of itbefore to fully register the loss of my world? Or is it the look on Gale’s faceas he takes in the destruction on foot that makes the atrocity feel brand-new?Cressida directs the team to start with me at my old house. I ask her what shewants me to do. “Whatever you feel like,” she says. Standing back in my kitchen,I don’t feel like doing anything. In fact, I find myself focusing up at thesky—the only roof left—because too many memories are drowning me. After a while,Cressida says, “That’s fine, Katniss. Let’s move on.”Gale doesn’t get off so easily at his old address. Cressida films him in silencefor a few minutes, but just as he pulls the one remnant of his previous lifefrom the ashes—a twisted metal poker—she starts to question him about hisfamily, his job, life in the Seam. She makes him go back to the night of thefirebombing and reenact it, starting at his house, working his way down acrossthe Meadow and through the woods to the lake. I straggle behind the film crewand the bodyguards, feeling their presence to be a violation of my belovedwoods. This is a private place, a sanctuary, already corrupted by the Capitol’sevil. Even after we’ve left behind the charred stumps near the fence, we’restill tripping over decomposing bodies. Do we have to record it for everyone tosee?By the time we reach the lake, Gale seems to have lost his ability to speak.Everyone’s dripping in sweat—especially Castor and Pollux in their insectshells—and Cressida calls for a break. I scoop up handfuls of water from thelake, wishing I could dive in and surface alone and naked and unobserved. Iwander around the perimeter for a while. When I come back around to the littleconcrete house beside the lake, I pause in the doorway and see Gale propping thecrooked poker he salvaged against the wall by the hearth. For a moment I have animage of a lone stranger, sometime far in the future, wandering lost in thewilderness and coming upon this small place of refuge, with the pile of splitlogs, the hearth, the poker. Wondering how it came to be. Gale turns and meetsmy eyes and I know he’s thinking about our last meeting here. When we foughtover whether or not to run away. If we had, would District 12 still be there? Ithink it would. But the Capitol would still be in control of Panem as well.Cheese sandwiches are passed around and we eat them in the shade of the trees. Iintentionally sit at the far edge of the group, next to Pollux, so I don’t haveto talk. No one’s talking much, really. In the relative quiet, the birds takeback the woods. I nudge Pollux with my elbow and point out a small black birdwith a crown. It hops to a new branch, momentarily opening its wings, showingoff its white patches. Pollux gestures to my pin and raises his eyebrowsquestioningly. I nod, confirming it’s a mockingjay. I hold up one finger to sayWait, I’ll show you, and whistle a birdcall. The mockingjay cocks its head andwhistles the call right back at me. Then, to my surprise, Pollux whistles a fewnotes of his own. The bird answers him immediately. Pollux’s face breaks into anexpression of delight and he has a series of melodic exchanges with themockingjay. My guess is it’s the first conversation he’s had in years. Musicdraws mockingjays like blossoms do bees, and in a short while he’s got half adozen of them perched in the branches over our heads. He taps me on the arm anduses a twig to write a word in the dirt. SING?Usually, I’d decline, but it’s kind of impossible to say no to Pollux, given thecircumstances. Besides, the mockingjays’ song voices are different from theirwhistles, and I’d like him to hear them. So, before I actually think about whatI’m doing, I sing Rue’s four notes, the ones she used to signal the end of theworkday in 11. The notes that ended up as the background music to her murder.The birds don’t know that. They pick up the simple phrase and bounce it back andforth between them in sweet harmony. Just as they did in the Hunger Games beforethe muttations broke through the trees, chased us onto the Cornucopia, andslowly gnawed Cato to a bloody pulp—“Want to hear them do a real song?” I burst out. Anything to stop thosememories. I’m on my feet, moving back into the trees, resting my hand on therough trunk of a maple where the birds perch. I have not sung “The Hanging Tree”out loud for ten years, because it’s forbidden, but I remember every word. Ibegin softly, sweetly, as my father did.“Are you, are youComing to the treeWhere they strung up a man they say murdered three.Strange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.”The mockingjays begin to alter their songs as they become aware of my newoffering.“Are you, are youComing to the treeWhere the dead man called out for his love to flee.Strange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.”I have the birds’ attention now. In one more verse, surely they will havecaptured the melody, as it’s simple and repeats four times with littlevariation.“Are you, are youComing to the treeWhere I told you to run, so we’d both be free.Strange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.”A hush in the trees. Just the rustle of leaves in the breeze. But no birds,mockingjay or other. Peeta’s right. They do fall silent when I sing. Just asthey did for my father.“Are you, are youComing to the treeWear a necklace of rope, side by side with me.Strange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.”The birds are waiting for me to continue. But that’s it. Last verse. In thestillness I remember the scene. I was home from a day in the woods with myfather. Sitting on the floor with Prim, who was just a toddler, singing “TheHanging Tree.” Making us necklaces out of scraps of old rope like it said in thesong, not knowing the real meaning of the words. The tune was simple and easy toharmonize to, though, and back then I could memorize almost anything set tomusic after a round or two. Suddenly, my mother snatched the rope necklaces awayand was yelling at my father. I started to cry because my mother never yelled,and then Prim was wailing and I ran outside to hide. As I had exactly one hidingspot—in the Meadow under a honeysuckle bush—my father found me immediately. Hecalmed me down and told me everything was fine, only we’d better not sing thatsong anymore. My mother just wanted me to forget it. So, of course, every wordwas immediately, irrevocably branded into my brain.We didn’t sing it anymore, my father and I, or even speak of it. After he died,it used to come back to me a lot. Being older, I began to understand the lyrics.At the beginning, it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriend tosecretly meet up with him at midnight. But it’s an odd place for a tryst, ahanging tree, where a man was hung for murder. The murderer’s lover must havehad something to do with the killing, or maybe they were just going to punishher anyway, because his corpse called out for her to flee. That’s weirdobviously, the talking-corpse bit, but it’s not until the third verse that “TheHanging Tree” begins to get unnerving. You realize the singer of the song is thedead murderer. He’s still in the hanging tree. And even though he told his loverto flee, he keeps asking if she’s coming to meet him. The phrase Where I toldyou to run, so we’d both be free is the most troubling because at first youthink he’s talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety. Butthen you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To death. In the finalstanza, it’s clear that that’s what he’s waiting for. His lover, with her ropenecklace, hanging dead next to him in the tree.I used to think the murderer was the creepiest guy imaginable. Now, with acouple of trips to the Hunger Games under my belt, I decide not to judge himwithout knowing more details. Maybe his lover was already sentenced to death andhe was trying to make it easier. To let her know he’d be waiting. Or maybe hethought the place he was leaving her was really worse than death. Didn’t I wantto kill Peeta with that syringe to save him from the Capitol? Was that really myonly option? Probably not, but I couldn’t think of another at the time.I guess my mother thought the whole thing was too twisted for a seven-year-old,though. Especially one who made her own rope necklaces. It wasn’t like hangingwas something that only happened in a story. Plenty of people were executed thatway in 12. You can bet she didn’t want me singing it in front of my music class.She probably wouldn’t like me doing it here for Pollux even, but at least I’mnot—wait, no, I’m wrong. As I glance sideways, I see Castor has been taping me.Everyone is watching me intently. And Pollux has tears running down his cheeksbecause no doubt my freaky song has dredged up some terrible incident in hislife. Great. I sigh and lean back against the trunk. That’s when the mockingjaysbegin their rendition of “The Hanging Tree.” In their mouths, it’s quitebeautiful. Conscious of being filmed, I stand quietly until I hear Cressidacall, “Cut!”Plutarch crosses to me, laughing. “Where do you come up with this stuff? No onewould believe it if we made it up!” He throws an arm around me and kisses me onthe top of my head with a loud smack. “You’re golden!”“I wasn’t doing it for the cameras,” I say.“Lucky they were on, then,” he says. “Come on, everybody, back to town!”As we trudge back through the woods, we reach a boulder, and both Gale and Iturn our heads in the same direction, like a pair of dogs catching a scent onthe wind. Cressida notices and asks what lies that way. We admit, withoutacknowledging each other, it’s our old hunting rendezvous place. She wants tosee it, even after we tell her it’s nothing really.Nothing but a place where I was happy, I think.Our rock ledge overlooking the valley. Perhaps a little less green than usual,but the blackberry bushes hang heavy with fruit. Here began countless days ofhunting and snaring, fishing and gathering, roaming together through the woods,unloading our thoughts while we filled our game bags. This was the doorway toboth sustenance and sanity. And we were each other’s key.There’s no District 12 to escape from now, no Peacekeepers to trick, no hungrymouths to feed. The Capitol took away all of that, and I’m on the verge oflosing Gale as well. The glue of mutual need that bonded us so tightly togetherfor all those years is melting away. Dark patches, not light, show in the spacesbetween us. How can it be that today, in the face of 12’s horrible demise, weare too angry to even speak to each other?Gale as good as lied to me. That was unacceptable, even if he was concernedabout my well-being. His apology seemed genuine, though. And I threw it back inhis face with an insult to make sure it stung. What is happening to us? Why arewe always at odds now? It’s all a muddle, but I somehow feel that if I went backto the root of our troubles, my actions would be at the heart of it. Do I reallywant to drive him away?My fingers encircle a blackberry and pluck it from its stem. I roll it gentlybetween my thumb and forefinger. Suddenly, I turn to him and toss it in hisdirection. “And may the odds—” I say. I throw it high so he has plenty of timeto decide whether to knock it aside or accept it.Gale’s eyes train on me, not the berry, but at the last moment, he opens hismouth and catches it. He chews, swallows, and there’s a long pause before hesays “—be ever in your favor.” But he does say it.Cressida has us sit in the nook in the rocks, where it’s impossible not to betouching, and coaxes us into talking about hunting. What drove us out into thewoods, how we met, favorite moments. We thaw, begin to laugh a little, as werelate mishaps with bees and wild dogs and skunks. When the conversation turnsto how it felt to translate our skill with weapons to the bombing in 8, I stoptalking. Gale just says, “Long overdue.”By the time we reach the town square, afternoon’s sinking into evening. I takeCressida to the rubble of the bakery and ask her to film something. The onlyemotion I can muster is exhaustion. “Peeta, this is your home. None of yourfamily has been heard of since the bombing. Twelve is gone. And you’re callingfor a cease-fire?” I look across the emptiness. “There’s no one left to hearyou.”As we stand before the lump of metal that was the gallows, Cressida asks ifeither of us has ever been tortured. In answer, Gale pulls off his shirt andturns his back to the camera. I stare at the lash marks, and again hear thewhistling of the whip, see his bloody figure hanging unconscious by his wrists.“I’m done,” I announce. “I’ll meet you at the Victor’s Village. Something for…mymother.”I guess I walked here, but the next thing I’m conscious of is sitting on thefloor in front of the kitchen cabinets of our house in the Victor’s Village.Meticulously lining ceramic jars and glass bottles into a box. Placing cleancotton bandages between them to prevent breaking. Wrapping bunches of driedflowers.Suddenly, I remember the rose on my dresser. Was it real? If so, is it still upthere? I have to resist the temptation to check. If it’s there, it will onlyfrighten me all over again. I hurry with my packing.When the cabinets are empty, I rise to find that Gale has materialized in mykitchen. It’s disturbing how soundlessly he can appear. He’s leaning on thetable, his fingers spread wide against the wood grain. I set the box between us.“Remember?” he asks. “This is where you kissed me.”So the heavy dose of morphling administered after the whipping wasn’t enough toerase that from his consciousness. “I didn’t think you’d remember that,” I say.“Have to be dead to forget. Maybe even not then,” he tells me. “Maybe I’ll belike that man in ‘The Hanging Tree.’ Still waiting for an answer.” Gale, who Ihave never seen cry, has tears in his eyes. To keep them from spilling over, Ireach forward and press my lips against his. We taste of heat, ashes, andmisery. It’s a surprising flavor for such a gentle kiss. He pulls away first andgives me a wry smile. “I knew you’d kiss me.”“How?” I say. Because I didn’t know myself.“Because I’m in pain,” he says. “That’s the only way I get your attention.” Hepicks up the box. “Don’t worry, Katniss. It’ll pass.” He leaves before I cananswer.I’m too weary to work through his latest charge. I spend the short ride back to13 curled up in a seat, trying to ignore Plutarch going on about one of hisfavorite subjects—weapons mankind no longer has at its disposal. High-flyingplanes, military satellites, cell disintegrators, drones, biological weaponswith expiration dates. Brought down by the destruction of the atmosphere or lackof resources or moral squeamishness. You can hear the regret of a Head Gamemakerwho can only dream of such toys, who must make do with hovercraft andland-to-land missiles and plain old guns.After dropping off my Mockingjay suit, I go straight to bed without eating. Evenso, Prim has to shake me to get me up in the morning. After breakfast, I ignoremy schedule and take a nap in the supply closet. When I come to, crawling outfrom between the boxes of chalk and pencils, it’s dinnertime again. I get anextra-large portion of pea soup and am headed back to Compartment E when Boggsintercepts me.“There’s a meeting in Command. Disregard your current schedule,” he says.“Done,” I say.“Did you follow it at all today?” he asks in exasperation.“Who knows? I’m mentally disoriented.” I hold up my wrist to show my medicalbracelet and realize it’s gone. “See? I can’t even remember they took mybracelet. Why do they want me in Command? Did I miss something?”“I think Cressida wanted to show you the Twelve propos. But I guess you’ll seethem when they air,” he says.“That’s what I need a schedule of. When the propos air,” I say. He shoots me alook but doesn’t comment further.People have crowded into Command, but they’ve saved me a seat between Finnickand Plutarch. The screens are already up on the table, showing the regularCapitol feed.“What’s going on? Aren’t we seeing the Twelve propos?” I ask.“Oh, no,” says Plutarch. “I mean, possibly. I don’t know exactly what footageBeetee plans to use.”“Beetee thinks he’s found a way to break into the feed nationwide,” saysFinnick. “So that our propos will air in the Capitol, too. He’s down working onit in Special Defense now. There’s live programming tonight. Snow’s making anappearance or something. I think it’s starting.”The Capitol seal appears, underscored by the anthem. Then I’m staring directlyinto President Snow’s snake eyes as he greets the nation. He seems barricadedbehind his podium, but the white rose in his lapel is in full view. The camerapulls back to include Peeta, off to one side in front of a projected map ofPanem. He’s sitting in an elevated chair, his shoes supported by a metal rung.The foot of his prosthetic leg taps out a strange irregular beat. Beads of sweathave broken through the layer of powder on his upper lip and forehead. But it’sthe look in his eyes—angry yet unfocused—that frightens me the most.“He’s worse,” I whisper. Finnick grasps my hand, to give me an anchor, and I tryto hang on.Peeta begins to speak in a frustrated tone about the need for the cease-fire. Hehighlights the damage done to key infrastructure in various districts, and as hespeaks, parts of the map light up, showing images of the destruction. A brokendam in 7. A derailed train with a pool of toxic waste spilling from the tankcars. A granary collapsing after a fire. All of these he attributes to rebelaction.Bam! Without warning, I’m suddenly on television, standing in the rubble of thebakery.Plutarch jumps to his feet. “He did it! Beetee broke in!”The room’s buzzing with reaction when Peeta’s back, distracted. He has seen meon the monitor. He tries to pick up his speech by moving on to the bombing of awater purification plant, when a clip of Finnick talking about Rue replaces him.And then the whole thing breaks down into a broadcast battle, as the Capitoltech masters try to fend off Beetee’s attack. But they are unprepared, andBeetee, apparently anticipating he would not hold on to control, has an arsenalof five- to ten-second clips to work with. We watch the official presentationdeteriorate as it’s peppered with choice shots from the propos.Plutarch’s in spasms of delight and most everybody is cheering Beetee on, butFinnick remains still and speechless beside me. I meet Haymitch’s eyes fromacross the room and see my own dread mirrored back. The recognition that withevery cheer, Peeta slips even farther from our grasp.The Capitol seal’s back up, accompanied by a flat audio tone. This lasts abouttwenty seconds before Snow and Peeta return. The set is in turmoil. We’rehearing frantic exchanges from their booth. Snow plows forward, saying thatclearly the rebels are now attempting to disrupt the dissemination ofinformation they find incriminating, but both truth and justice will reign. Thefull broadcast will resume when security has been reinstated. He asks Peeta if,given tonight’s demonstration, he has any parting thoughts for Katniss Everdeen.At the mention of my name, Peeta’s face contorts in effort. “Katniss…how do youthink this will end? What will be left? No one is safe. Not in the Capitol. Notin the districts. And you…in Thirteen…” He inhales sharply, as if fighting forair; his eyes look insane. “Dead by morning!”Off camera, Snow orders, “End it!” Beetee throws the whole thing into chaos byflashing a still shot of me standing in front of the hospital at three-secondintervals. But between the images, we are privy to the real-life action beingplayed out on the set. Peeta’s attempt to continue speaking. The camera knockeddown to record the white tiled floor. The scuffle of boots. The impact of theblow that’s inseparable from Peeta’s cry of pain.And his blood as it splatters the tiles."},{"pageContent":"PART II [mockingjay_TOC.html#pt_02]“THE ASSAULT” [mockingjay_TOC.html#pt_02]"},{"pageContent":"10 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_10]The scream begins in my lower back and works its way up through my body only tojam in my throat. I am Avox mute, choking on my grief. Even if I could releasethe muscles in my neck, let the sound tear into space, would anyone notice it?The room’s in an uproar. Questions and demands ring out as they try to decipherPeeta’s words. “And you…in Thirteen…dead by morning!” Yet no one is asking aboutthe messenger whose blood has been replaced by static.A voice calls the others to attention. “Shut up!” Every pair of eyes falls onHaymitch. “It’s not some big mystery! The boy’s telling us we’re about to beattacked. Here. In Thirteen.”“How would he have that information?”“Why should we trust him?”“How do you know?”Haymitch gives a growl of frustration. “They’re beating him bloody while wespeak. What more do you need? Katniss, help me out here!”I have to give myself a shake to free my words. “Haymitch’s right. I don’t knowwhere Peeta got the information. Or if it’s true. But he believes it is. Andthey’re—” I can’t say aloud what Snow’s doing to him.“You don’t know him,” Haymitch says to Coin. “We do. Get your people ready.”The president doesn’t seem alarmed, only somewhat perplexed, by this turn inevents. She mulls over the words, tapping one finger lightly on the rim of thecontrol board in front of her. When she speaks, she addresses Haymitch in aneven voice. “Of course, we have prepared for such a scenario. Although we havedecades of support for the assumption that further direct attacks on Thirteenwould be counterproductive to the Capitol’s cause. Nuclear missiles wouldrelease radiation into the atmosphere, with incalculable environmental results.Even routine bombing could badly damage our military compound, which we knowthey hope to regain. And, of course, they invite a counterstrike. It isconceivable that, given our current alliance with the rebels, those would beviewed as acceptable risks.”“You think so?” says Haymitch. It’s a shade too sincere, but the subtleties ofirony are often wasted in 13.“I do. At any rate, we’re overdue for a Level Five security drill,” says Coin.“Let’s proceed with the lockdown.” She begins to type rapidly on her keyboard,authorizing her decision. The moment she raises her head, it begins.There have been two low-level drills since I arrived in 13. I don’t remembermuch about the first. I was in intensive care in the hospital and I think thepatients were exempted, as the complications of removing us for a practice drilloutweighed the benefits. I was vaguely aware of a mechanical voice instructingpeople to congregate in yellow zones. During the second, a Level Two drill meantfor minor crises—such as a temporary quarantine while citizens were tested forcontagion during a flu outbreak—we were supposed to return to our livingquarters. I stayed behind a pipe in the laundry room, ignored the pulsatingbeeps coming over the audio system, and watched a spider construct a web.Neither experience has prepared me for the wordless, eardrum-piercing,fear-inducing sirens that now permeate 13. There would be no disregarding thissound, which seems designed to throw the whole population into a frenzy. Butthis is 13 and that doesn’t happen.Boggs guides Finnick and me out of Command, along the hall to a doorway, andonto a wide stairway. Streams of people are converging to form a river thatflows only downward. No one shrieks or tries to push ahead. Even the childrendon’t resist. We descend, flight after flight, speechless, because no word couldbe heard above this sound. I look for my mother and Prim, but it’s impossible tosee anyone but those immediately around me. They’re both working in the hospitaltonight, though, so there’s no way they can miss the drill.My ears pop and my eyes feel heavy. We are coal-mine deep. The only plus is thatthe farther we retreat into the earth, the less shrill the sirens become. It’sas if they were meant to physically drive us away from the surface, which Isuppose they are. Groups of people begin to peel off into marked doorways andstill Boggs directs me downward, until finally the stairs end at the edge of anenormous cavern. I start to walk straight in and Boggs stops me, shows me that Imust wave my schedule in front of a scanner so that I’m accounted for. No doubtthe information’s going to some computer somewhere to make sure no one’s goneastray.The place seems unable to decide if it’s natural or man-made. Certain areas ofthe walls are stone, while steel beams and concrete heavily reinforce others.Sleeping bunks are hewn right into the rock walls. There’s a kitchen, bathrooms,a first-aid station. This place was designed for an extended stay.White signs with letters or numbers are placed at intervals around the cavern.As Boggs tells Finnick and me to report to the area that matches our assignedquarters—in my case E for Compartment E—Plutarch strolls up. “Ah, here you are,”he says. Recent events have had little effect on Plutarch’s mood. He still has ahappy glow from Beetee’s success on the Airtime Assault. Eyes on the forest, noton the trees. Not on Peeta’s punishment or 13’s imminent blasting. “Katniss,obviously this is a bad moment for you, what with Peeta’s setback, but you needto be aware that others will be watching you.”“What?” I say. I can’t believe he actually just downgraded Peeta’s direcircumstances to a setback.“The other people in the bunker, they’ll be taking their cue on how to reactfrom you. If you’re calm and brave, others will try to be as well. If you panic,it could spread like wildfire,” explains Plutarch. I just stare at him. “Fire iscatching, so to speak,” he continues, as if I’m being slow on the uptake.“Why don’t I just pretend I’m on camera, Plutarch?” I say.“Yes! Perfect. One is always much braver with an audience,” he says. “Look atthe courage Peeta just displayed!”It’s all I can do not to slap him.“I’ve got to get back to Coin before lockdown. You keep up the good work!” hesays, and then heads off.I cross to the big letter E posted on the wall. Our space consists of atwelve-by-twelve-foot square of stone floor delineated by painted lines. Carvedinto the wall are two bunks—one of us will be sleeping on the floor—and aground-level cube space for storage. A piece of white paper, coated in clearplastic, reads BUNKER PROTOCOL. I stare fixedly at the little black specks onthe sheet. For a while, they’re obscured by the residual blood droplets that Ican’t seem to wipe from my vision. Slowly, the words come into focus. The firstsection is entitled “On Arrival.” * 1. Make sure all members of your Compartment are accounted for.My mother and Prim haven’t arrived, but I was one of the first people to reachthe bunker. Both of them are probably helping to relocate hospital patients. * 2. Go to the Supply Station and secure one pack for each member of your Compartment. Ready your Living Area. Return pack(s).I scan the cavern until I locate the Supply Station, a deep room set off by acounter. People wait behind it, but there’s not a lot of activity there yet. Iwalk over, give our compartment letter, and request three packs. A man checks asheet, pulls the specified packs from shelving, and swings them up onto thecounter. After sliding one on my back and getting a grip on the other two withmy hands, I turn to find a group rapidly forming behind me. “Excuse me,” I sayas I carry my supplies through the others. Is it a matter of timing? Or isPlutarch right? Are these people modeling their behavior on mine?Back at our space, I open one of the packs to find a thin mattress, bedding, twosets of gray clothing, a toothbrush, a comb, and a flashlight. On examining thecontents of the other packs, I find the only discernible difference is that theycontain both gray and white outfits. The latter will be for my mother and Prim,in case they have medical duties. After I make up the beds, store the clothes,and return the backpacks, I’ve got nothing to do but observe the last rule. * 3. Await further instructions.I sit cross-legged on the floor to await. A steady flow of people begins to fillthe room, claiming spaces, collecting supplies. It won’t take long until theplace is full up. I wonder if my mother and Prim are going to stay the night atwherever the hospital patients have been taken. But, no, I don’t think so. Theywere on the list here. I’m starting to get anxious, when my mother appears. Ilook behind her into a sea of strangers. “Where’s Prim?” I ask.“Isn’t she here?” she replies. “She was supposed to come straight down from thehospital. She left ten minutes before I did. Where is she? Where could she havegone?”I squeeze my lids shut tight for a moment, to track her as I would prey on ahunt. See her react to the sirens, rush to help the patients, nod as theygesture for her to descend to the bunker, and then hesitate with her on thestairs. Torn for a moment. But why?My eyes fly open. “The cat! She went back for him!”“Oh, no,” my mother says. We both know I’m right. We’re pushing against theincoming tide, trying to get out of the bunker. Up ahead, I can see thempreparing to shut the thick metal doors. Slowly rotating the metal wheels oneither side inward. Somehow I know that once they have been sealed, nothing inthe world will convince the soldiers to open them. Perhaps it will even bebeyond their control. I’m indiscriminately shoving people aside as I shout forthem to wait. The space between the doors shrinks to a yard, a foot; there areonly a few inches left when I jam my hand through the crack.“Open it! Let me out!” I cry.Consternation shows on the soldiers’ faces as they reverse the wheels a bit. Notenough to let me pass, but enough to avoid crushing my fingers. I take theopportunity to wedge my shoulder into the opening. “Prim!” I holler up thestairs. My mother pleads with the guards as I try to wriggle my way out. “Prim!”Then I hear it. The faint sound of footsteps on the stairs. “We’re coming!” Ihear my sister call.“Hold the door!” That was Gale.“They’re coming!” I tell the guards, and they slide the doors open about a foot.But I don’t dare move—afraid they’ll lock us all out—until Prim appears, hercheeks flushed with running, hauling Buttercup. I pull her inside and Galefollows, twisting an armload of baggage sideways to get it into the bunker. Thedoors are closed with a loud and final clank.“What were you thinking?” I give Prim an angry shake and then hug her, squashingButtercup between us.Prim’s explanation is already on her lips. “I couldn’t leave him behind,Katniss. Not twice. You should have seen him pacing the room and howling. He’dcome back to protect us.”“Okay. Okay.” I take a few breaths to calm myself, step back, and lift Buttercupby the scruff of the neck. “I should’ve drowned you when I had the chance.” Hisears flatten and he raises a paw. I hiss before he gets a chance, which seems toannoy him a little, since he considers hissing his own personal sound ofcontempt. In retaliation, he gives a helpless kitten mew that brings my sisterimmediately to his defense.“Oh, Katniss, don’t tease him,” she says, folding him back in her arms. “He’salready so upset.”The idea that I’ve wounded the brute’s tiny cat feelings just invites furthertaunting. But Prim’s genuinely distressed for him. So instead, I visualizeButtercup’s fur lining a pair of gloves, an image that has helped me deal withhim over the years. “Okay, sorry. We’re under the big E on the wall. Better gethim settled in before he loses it.” Prim hurries off, and I find myselfface-to-face with Gale. He’s holding the box of medical supplies from ourkitchen in 12. Site of our last conversation, kiss, fallout, whatever. My gamebag’s slung across his shoulder.“If Peeta’s right, these didn’t stand a chance,” he says.Peeta. Blood like raindrops on the window. Like wet mud on boots.“Thanks for…everything.” I take our stuff. “What were you doing up in ourrooms?”“Just double-checking,” he says. “We’re in Forty-Seven if you need me.”Practically everyone withdrew to their spaces when the doors shut, so I get tocross to our new home with at least five hundred people watching me. I try toappear extra calm to make up for my frantic crashing through the crowd. Likethat’s fooling anyone. So much for setting an example. Oh, who cares? They allthink I’m nuts anyway. One man, who I think I knocked to the floor, catches myeye and rubs his elbow resentfully. I almost hiss at him, too.Prim has Buttercup installed on the lower bunk, draped in a blanket so that onlyhis face pokes out. This is how he likes to be when there’s thunder, the onething that actually frightens him. My mother puts her box carefully in the cube.I crouch, my back supported by the wall, to check what Gale managed to rescue inmy hunting bag. The plant book, the hunting jacket, my parents’ wedding photo,and the personal contents of my drawer. My mockingjay pin now lives with Cinna’soutfit, but there’s the gold locket and the silver parachute with the spile andPeeta’s pearl. I knot the pearl into the corner of the parachute, bury it deepin the recesses of the bag, as if it’s Peeta’s life and no one can take it awayas long as I guard it.The faint sound of the sirens cuts off sharply. Coin’s voice comes over thedistrict audio system, thanking us all for an exemplary evacuation of the upperlevels. She stresses that this is not a drill, as Peeta Mellark, the District 12victor, has possibly made a televised reference to an attack on 13 tonight.That’s when the first bomb hits. There’s an initial sense of impact followed byan explosion that resonates in my innermost parts, the lining of my intestines,the marrow of my bones, the roots of my teeth. We’re all going to die, I think.My eyes turn upward, expecting to see giant cracks race across the ceiling,massive chunks of stone raining down on us, but the bunker itself gives only aslight shudder. The lights go out and I experience the disorientation of totaldarkness. Speechless human sounds—spontaneous shrieks, ragged breaths, babywhimpers, one musical bit of insane laughter—dance around in the charged air.Then there’s a hum of a generator, and a dim wavering glow replaces the starklighting that is the norm in 13. It’s closer to what we had in our homes in 12,when the candles and fire burned low on a winter’s night.I reach for Prim in the twilight, clamp my hand on her leg, and pull myself overto her. Her voice remains steady as she croons to Buttercup. “It’s all right,baby, it’s all right. We’ll be okay down here.”My mother wraps her arms around us. I allow myself to feel young for a momentand rest my head on her shoulder. “That was nothing like the bombs in Eight,” Isay.“Probably a bunker missile,” says Prim, keeping her voice soothing for the cat’ssake. “We learned about them during the orientation for new citizens. They’redesigned to penetrate deep in the ground before they go off. Because there’s nopoint in bombing Thirteen on the surface anymore.”“Nuclear?” I ask, feeling a chill run through me.“Not necessarily,” says Prim. “Some just have a lot of explosives in them.But…it could be either kind, I guess.”The gloom makes it hard to see the heavy metal doors at the end of the bunker.Would they be any protection against a nuclear attack? And even if they were onehundred percent effective at sealing out the radiation, which is reallyunlikely, would we ever be able to leave this place? The thought of spendingwhatever remains of my life in this stone vault horrifies me. I want to runmadly for the door and demand to be released into whatever lies above. It’spointless. They would never let me out, and I might start some kind of stampede.“We’re so far down, I’m sure we’re safe,” says my mother wanly. Is she thinkingof my father’s being blown to nothingness in the mines? “It was a close call,though. Thank goodness Peeta had the wherewithal to warn us.”The wherewithal. A general term that somehow includes everything that was neededfor him to sound the alarm. The knowledge, the opportunity, the courage. Andsomething else I can’t define. Peeta seemed to have been waging a sort of battlein his mind, fighting to get the message out. Why? The ease with which hemanipulates words is his greatest talent. Was his difficulty a result of historture? Something more? Like madness?Coin’s voice, perhaps a shade grimmer, fills the bunker, the volume levelflickering with the lights. “Apparently, Peeta Mellark’s information was soundand we owe him a great debt of gratitude. Sensors indicate the first missile wasnot nuclear, but very powerful. We expect more will follow. For the duration ofthe attack, citizens are to stay in their assigned areas unless otherwisenotified.”A soldier alerts my mother that she’s needed in the first-aid station. She’sreluctant to leave us, even though she’ll only be thirty yards away.“We’ll be fine, really,” I tell her. “Do you think anything could get past him?”I point to Buttercup, who gives me such a halfhearted hiss, we all have to laugha little. Even I feel sorry for him. After my mother goes, I suggest, “Why don’tyou climb in with him, Prim?”“I know it’s silly…but I’m afraid the bunk might collapse on us during theattack,” she says.If the bunks collapse, the whole bunker will have given way and buried us, but Idecide this kind of logic won’t actually be helpful. Instead, I clean out thestorage cube and make Buttercup a bed inside. Then I pull a mattress in front ofit for my sister and me to share.We’re given clearance in small groups to use the bathroom and brush our teeth,although showering has been canceled for the day. I curl up with Prim on themattress, double layering the blankets because the cavern emits a dank chill.Buttercup, miserable even with Prim’s constant attention, huddles in the cubeand exhales cat breath in my face.Despite the disagreeable conditions, I’m glad to have time with my sister. Myextreme preoccupation since I came here—no, since the first Games, really—hasleft little attention for her. I haven’t been watching over her the way Ishould, the way I used to. After all, it was Gale who checked our compartment,not me. Something to make up for.I realize I’ve never even bothered to ask her about how she’s handling the shockof coming here. “So, how are you liking Thirteen, Prim?” I offer.“Right now?” she asks. We both laugh. “I miss home badly sometimes. But then Iremember there’s nothing left to miss anymore. I feel safer here. We don’t haveto worry about you. Well, not the same way.” She pauses, and then a shy smilecrosses her lips. “I think they’re going to train me to be a doctor.”It’s the first I’ve heard of it. “Well, of course, they are. They’d be stupidnot to.”“They’ve been watching me when I help out in the hospital. I’m already takingthe medic courses. It’s just beginner’s stuff. I know a lot of it from home.Still, there’s plenty to learn,” she tells me.“That’s great,” I say. Prim a doctor. She couldn’t even dream of it in 12.Something small and quiet, like a match being struck, lights up the gloom insideme. This is the sort of future a rebellion could bring.“What about you, Katniss? How are you managing?” Her fingertip moves in short,gentle strokes between Buttercup’s eyes. “And don’t say you’re fine.”It’s true. Whatever the opposite of fine is, that’s what I am. So I go ahead andtell her about Peeta, his deterioration on-screen, and how I think they must bekilling him at this very moment. Buttercup has to rely on himself for a while,because now Prim turns her attention to me. Pulling me closer, brushing the hairback behind my ears with her fingers. I’ve stopped talking because there’sreally nothing left to say and there’s this piercing sort of pain where my heartis. Maybe I’m even having a heart attack, but it doesn’t seem worth mentioning.“Katniss, I don’t think President Snow will kill Peeta,” she says. Of course,she says this; it’s what she thinks will calm me. But her next words come as asurprise. “If he does, he won’t have anyone left you want. He won’t have any wayto hurt you.”Suddenly, I am reminded of another girl, one who had seen all the evil theCapitol had to offer. Johanna Mason, the tribute from District 7, in the lastarena. I was trying to prevent her from going into the jungle where thejabberjays mimicked the voices of loved ones being tortured, but she brushed meoff, saying, “They can’t hurt me. I’m not like the rest of you. There’s no oneleft I love.”Then I know Prim is right, that Snow cannot afford to waste Peeta’s life,especially now, while the Mockingjay causes so much havoc. He’s killed Cinnaalready. Destroyed my home. My family, Gale, and even Haymitch are out of hisreach. Peeta’s all he has left.“So, what do you think they’ll do to him?” I ask.Prim sounds about a thousand years old when she speaks.“Whatever it takes to break you.”"},{"pageContent":"11 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_11]What will break me?This is the question that consumes me over the next three days as we wait to bereleased from our prison of safety. What will break me into a million pieces sothat I am beyond repair, beyond usefulness? I mention it to no one, but itdevours my waking hours and weaves itself throughout my nightmares.Four more bunker missiles fall over this period, all massive, all very damaging,but there’s no urgency to the attack. The bombs are spread out over the longhours so that just when you think the raid is over, another blast sends shockwaves through your guts. It feels more designed to keep us in lockdown than todecimate 13. Cripple the district, yes. Give the people plenty to do to get theplace running again. But destroy it? No. Coin was right on that point. You don’tdestroy what you want to acquire in the future. I assume what they really want,in the short term, is to stop the Airtime Assaults and keep me off thetelevisions of Panem.We receive next to no information about what is happening. Our screens nevercome on, and we get only brief audio updates from Coin about the nature of thebombs. Certainly, the war is still being waged, but as to its status, we’re inthe dark.Inside the bunker, cooperation is the order of the day. We adhere to a strictschedule for meals and bathing, exercise and sleep. Small periods ofsocialization are granted to alleviate the tedium. Our space becomes verypopular because both children and adults have a fascination with Buttercup. Heattains celebrity status with his evening game of Crazy Cat. I created this byaccident a few years ago, during a winter blackout. You simply wiggle aflashlight beam around on the floor, and Buttercup tries to catch it. I’m pettyenough to enjoy it because I think it makes him look stupid. Inexplicably,everyone here thinks he’s clever and delightful. I’m even issued a special setof batteries—an enormous waste—to be used for this purpose. The citizens of 13are truly starved for entertainment.It’s on the third night, during our game, that I answer the question eating awayat me. Crazy Cat becomes a metaphor for my situation. I am Buttercup. Peeta, thething I want so badly to secure, is the light. As long as Buttercup feels he hasthe chance of catching the elusive light under his paws, he’s bristling withaggression. (That’s how I’ve been since I left the arena, with Peeta alive.)When the light goes out completely, Buttercup’s temporarily distraught andconfused, but he recovers and moves on to other things. (That’s what wouldhappen if Peeta died.) But the one thing that sends Buttercup into a tailspin iswhen I leave the light on but put it hopelessly out of his reach, high on thewall, beyond even his jumping skills. He paces below the wall, wails, and can’tbe comforted or distracted. He’s useless until I shut the light off. (That’swhat Snow is trying to do to me now, only I don’t know what form his gametakes.)Maybe this realization on my part is all Snow needs. Thinking that Peeta was inhis possession and being tortured for rebel information was bad. But thinkingthat he’s being tortured specifically to incapacitate me is unendurable. Andit’s under the weight of this revelation that I truly begin to break.After Crazy Cat, we’re directed to bed. The power’s been coming and going;sometimes the lamps burn at full brightness, other times we squint at oneanother in the brownouts. At bedtime they turn the lamps to near darkness andactivate safety lights in each space. Prim, who’s decided the walls will holdup, snuggles with Buttercup on the lower bunk. My mother’s on the upper. I offerto take a bunk, but they make me keep to the floor mattress since I flail aroundso much when I’m sleeping.I’m not flailing now, as my muscles are rigid with the tension of holding myselftogether. The pain over my heart returns, and from it I imagine tiny fissuresspreading out into my body. Through my torso, down my arms and legs, over myface, leaving it crisscrossed with cracks. One good jolt of a bunker missile andI could shatter into strange, razor-sharp shards.When the restless, wiggling majority has settled into sleep, I carefullyextricate myself from my blanket and tiptoe through the cavern until I findFinnick, feeling for some unspecified reason that he will understand. He sitsunder the safety light in his space, knotting his rope, not even pretending torest. As I whisper my discovery of Snow’s plan to break me, it dawns on me. Thisstrategy is very old news to Finnick. It’s what broke him.“This is what they’re doing to you with Annie, isn’t it?” I ask.“Well, they didn’t arrest her because they thought she’d be a wealth of rebelinformation,” he says. “They know I’d never have risked telling her anythinglike that. For her own protection.”“Oh, Finnick. I’m so sorry,” I say.“No, I’m sorry. That I didn’t warn you somehow,” he tells me.Suddenly, a memory surfaces. I’m strapped to my bed, mad with rage and griefafter the rescue. Finnick is trying to console me about Peeta. “They’ll figureout he doesn’t know anything pretty fast. And they won’t kill him if they thinkthey can use him against you.”“You did warn me, though. On the hovercraft. Only when you said they’d use Peetaagainst me, I thought you meant like bait. To lure me into the Capitol somehow,”I say.“I shouldn’t have said even that. It was too late for it to be of any help toyou. Since I hadn’t warned you before the Quarter Quell, I should’ve shut upabout how Snow operates.” Finnick yanks on the end of his rope, and an intricateknot becomes a straight line again. “It’s just that I didn’t understand when Imet you. After your first Games, I thought the whole romance was an act on yourpart. We all expected you’d continue that strategy. But it wasn’t until Peetahit the force field and nearly died that I—” Finnick hesitates.I think back to the arena. How I sobbed when Finnick revived Peeta. Thequizzical look on Finnick’s face. The way he excused my behavior, blaming it onmy pretend pregnancy. “That you what?”“That I knew I’d misjudged you. That you do love him. I’m not saying in whatway. Maybe you don’t know yourself. But anyone paying attention could see howmuch you care about him,” he says gently.Anyone? On Snow’s visit before the Victory Tour, he challenged me to erase anydoubts of my love for Peeta. “Convince me,” Snow said. It seems, under that hotpink sky with Peeta’s life in limbo, I finally did. And in doing so, I gave himthe weapon he needed to break me.Finnick and I sit for a long time in silence, watching the knots bloom andvanish, before I can ask, “How do you bear it?”Finnick looks at me in disbelief. “I don’t, Katniss! Obviously, I don’t. I dragmyself out of nightmares each morning and find there’s no relief in waking.”Something in my expression stops him. “Better not to give in to it. It takes tentimes as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.”Well, he must know. I take a deep breath, forcing myself back into one piece.“The more you can distract yourself, the better,” he says. “First thingtomorrow, we’ll get you your own rope. Until then, take mine.”I spend the rest of the night on my mattress obsessively making knots, holdingthem up for Buttercup’s inspection. If one looks suspicious, he swipes it out ofthe air and bites it a few times to make sure it’s dead. By morning, my fingersare sore, but I’m still holding on.With twenty-four hours of quiet behind us, Coin finally announces we can leavethe bunker. Our old quarters have been destroyed by the bombings. Everyone mustfollow exact directions to their new compartments. We clean our spaces, asdirected, and file obediently toward the door.Before I’m halfway there, Boggs appears and pulls me from the line. He signalsfor Gale and Finnick to join us. People move aside to let us by. Some even smileat me since the Crazy Cat game seems to have made me more lovable. Out the door,up the stairs, down the hall to one of those multidirectional elevators, andfinally we arrive at Special Defense. Nothing along our route has been damaged,but we are still very deep.Boggs ushers us into a room virtually identical to Command. Coin, Plutarch,Haymitch, Cressida, and everybody else around the table looks exhausted. Someonehas finally broken out the coffee—although I’m sure it’s viewed only as anemergency stimulant—and Plutarch has both hands wrapped tightly around his cupas if at any moment it might be taken away.There’s no small talk. “We need all four of you suited up and aboveground,” saysthe president. “You have two hours to get footage showing the damage from thebombing, establish that Thirteen’s military unit remains not only functional butdominant, and, most important, that the Mockingjay is still alive. Anyquestions?”“Can we have a coffee?” asks Finnick.Steaming cups are handed out. I stare distastefully at the shiny black liquid,never having been much of a fan of the stuff, but thinking it might help me stayon my feet. Finnick sloshes some cream in my cup and reaches into the sugarbowl. “Want a sugar cube?” he asks in his old seductive voice. That’s how wemet, with Finnick offering me sugar. Surrounded by horses and chariots, costumedand painted for the crowds, before we were allies. Before I had any idea whatmade him tick. The memory actually coaxes a smile out of me. “Here, it improvesthe taste,” he says in his real voice, plunking three cubes in my cup.As I turn to go suit up as the Mockingjay, I catch Gale watching me and Finnickunhappily. What now? Does he actually think something’s going on between us?Maybe he saw me go to Finnick’s last night. I would’ve passed the Hawthornes’space to get there. I guess that probably rubbed him the wrong way. Me seekingout Finnick’s company instead of his. Well, fine. I’ve got rope burn on myfingers, I can barely hold my eyes open, and a camera crew’s waiting for me todo something brilliant. And Snow’s got Peeta. Gale can think whatever he wants.In my new Remake Room in Special Defense, my prep team slaps me into myMockingjay suit, arranges my hair, and applies minimal makeup before my coffee’seven cooled. In ten minutes, the cast and crew of the next propos are making thecircuitous trek to the outside. I slurp my coffee as we travel, finding that thecream and sugar greatly enhance its flavor. As I knock back the dregs that havesettled to the bottom of the cup, I feel a slight buzz start to run through myveins.After climbing a final ladder, Boggs hits a lever that opens a trapdoor. Freshair rushes in. I take big gulps and for the first time allow myself to feel howmuch I hated the bunker. We emerge into the woods, and my hands run through theleaves overhead. Some are just starting to turn. “What day is it?” I ask no onein particular. Boggs tells me September begins next week.September. That means Snow has had Peeta in his clutches for five, maybe sixweeks. I examine a leaf on my palm and see I’m shaking. I can’t will myself tostop. I blame the coffee and try to focus on slowing my breathing, which is fartoo rapid for my pace.Debris begins to litter the forest floor. We come to our first crater, thirtyyards wide and I can’t tell how deep. Very. Boggs says anyone on the first tenlevels would likely have been killed. We skirt the pit and continue on.“Can you rebuild it?” Gale asks.“Not anytime soon. That one didn’t get much. A few backup generators and apoultry farm,” says Boggs. “We’ll just seal it off.”The trees disappear as we enter the area inside the fence. The craters areringed with a mixture of old and new rubble. Before the bombing, very little ofthe current 13 was aboveground. A few guard stations. The training area. About afoot of the top floor of our building—where Buttercup’s window jutted out—withseveral feet of steel on top of it. Even that was never meant to withstand morethan a superficial attack.“How much of an edge did the boy’s warning give you?” asks Haymitch.“About ten minutes before our own systems would’ve detected the missiles,” saysBoggs.“But it did help, right?” I ask. I can’t bear it if he says no.“Absolutely,” Boggs replies. “Civilian evacuation was completed. Seconds countwhen you’re under attack. Ten minutes meant lives saved.”Prim, I think. And Gale. They were in the bunker only a couple of minutes beforethe first missile hit. Peeta might have saved them. Add their names to the listof things I can never stop owing him for.Cressida has the idea to film me in front of the ruins of the old JusticeBuilding, which is something of a joke since the Capitol’s been using it as abackdrop for fake news broadcasts for years, to show that the district no longerexisted. Now, with the recent attack, the Justice Building sits about ten yardsaway from the edge of a new crater.As we approach what used to be the grand entrance, Gale points out something andthe whole party slows down. I don’t know what the problem is at first and then Isee the ground strewn with fresh pink and red roses. “Don’t touch them!” I yell.“They’re for me!”The sickeningly sweet smell hits my nose, and my heart begins to hammer againstmy chest. So I didn’t imagine it. The rose on my dresser. Before me lies Snow’ssecond delivery. Long-stemmed pink and red beauties, the very flowers thatdecorated the set where Peeta and I performed our post-victory interview.Flowers not meant for one, but for a pair of lovers.I explain to the others as best I can. Upon inspection, they appear to beharmless, if genetically enhanced, flowers. Two dozen roses. Slightly wilted.Most likely dropped after the last bombing. A crew in special suits collectsthem and carts them away. I feel certain they will find nothing extraordinary inthem, though. Snow knows exactly what he’s doing to me. It’s like having Cinnabeaten to a pulp while I watch from my tribute tube. Designed to unhinge me.Like then, I try to rally and fight back. But as Cressida gets Castor and Polluxin place, I feel my anxiety building. I’m so tired, so wired, and so unable tokeep my mind on anything but Peeta since I’ve seen the roses. The coffee was ahuge mistake. What I didn’t need was a stimulant. My body visibly shakes and Ican’t seem to catch my breath. After days in the bunker, I’m squinting no matterwhat direction I turn, and the light hurts. Even in the cool breeze, sweattrickles down my face.“So, what exactly do you need from me again?” I ask.“Just a few quick lines that show you’re alive and still fighting,” saysCressida.“Okay.” I take my position and then I’m staring into the red light. Staring.Staring. “I’m sorry, I’ve got nothing.”Cressida walks up to me. “You feeling okay?” I nod. She pulls a small cloth fromher pocket and blots my face. “How about we do the old Q-and-A thing?”“Yeah. That would help, I think.” I cross my arms to hide the shaking. Glance atFinnick, who gives me a thumbs-up. But he’s looking pretty shaky himself.Cressida’s back in position now. “So, Katniss. You’ve survived the Capitolbombing of Thirteen. How did it compare with what you experienced on the groundin Eight?”“We were so far underground this time, there was no real danger. Thirteen’salive and well and so am—” My voice cuts off in a dry, squeaking sound.“Try the line again,” says Cressida. “‘Thirteen’s alive and well and so am I.’”I take a breath, trying to force air down into my diaphragm. “Thirteen’s aliveand so—” No, that’s wrong.I swear I can still smell those roses.“Katniss, just this one line and you’re done today. I promise,” says Cressida.“‘Thirteen’s alive and well and so am I.’”I swing my arms to loosen myself up. Place my fists on my hips. Then drop themto my sides. Saliva’s filling my mouth at a ridiculous rate and I feel vomit atthe back of my throat. I swallow hard and open my lips so I can get the stupidline out and go hide in the woods and—that’s when I start crying.It’s impossible to be the Mockingjay. Impossible to complete even this onesentence. Because now I know that everything I say will be directly taken out onPeeta. Result in his torture. But not his death, no, nothing so merciful asthat. Snow will ensure that his life is much worse than death.“Cut,” I hear Cressida say quietly.“What’s wrong with her?” Plutarch says under his breath.“She’s figured out how Snow’s using Peeta,” says Finnick.There’s something like a collective sigh of regret from the semicircle of peoplespread out before me. Because I know this now. Because there will never be a wayfor me to not know this again. Because, beyond the military disadvantage losinga Mockingjay entails, I am broken.Several sets of arms would embrace me. But in the end, the only person I trulywant to comfort me is Haymitch, because he loves Peeta, too. I reach out for himand say something like his name and he’s there, holding me and patting my back.“It’s okay. It’ll be okay, sweetheart.” He sits me on a length of broken marblepillar and keeps an arm around me while I sob.“I can’t do this anymore,” I say.“I know,” he says.“All I can think of is—what he’s going to do to Peeta—because I’m theMockingjay!” I get out.“I know.” Haymitch’s arm tightens around me.“Did you see? How weird he acted? What are they—doing to him?” I’m gasping forair between sobs, but I manage one last phrase. “It’s my fault!” And then Icross some line into hysteria and there’s a needle in my arm and the world slipsaway.It must be strong, whatever they shot into me, because it’s a full day before Icome to. My sleep wasn’t peaceful, though. I have the sense of emerging from aworld of dark, haunted places where I traveled alone. Haymitch sits in the chairby my bed, his skin waxen, his eyes bloodshot. I remember about Peeta and startto tremble again.Haymitch reaches out and squeezes my shoulder. “It’s all right. We’re going totry to get Peeta out.”“What?” That makes no sense.“Plutarch’s sending in a rescue team. He has people on the inside. He thinks wecan get Peeta back alive,” he says.“Why didn’t we before?” I say.“Because it’s costly. But everyone agrees this is the thing to do. It’s the samechoice we made in the arena. To do whatever it takes to keep you going. We can’tlose the Mockingjay now. And you can’t perform unless you know Snow can’t takeit out on Peeta.” Haymitch offers me a cup. “Here, drink something.”I slowly sit up and take a sip of water. “What do you mean, costly?”He shrugs. “Covers will be blown. People may die. But keep in mind that they’redying every day. And it’s not just Peeta; we’re getting Annie out for Finnick,too.”“Where is he?” I ask.“Behind that screen, sleeping his sedative off. He lost it right after weknocked you out,” says Haymitch. I smile a little, feel a bit less weak. “Yeah,it was a really excellent shoot. You two cracked up and Boggs left to arrangethe mission to get Peeta. We’re officially in reruns.”“Well, if Boggs is leading it, that’s a plus,” I say.“Oh, he’s on top of it. It was volunteer only, but he pretended not to notice mewaving my hand in the air,” says Haymitch. “See? He’s already demonstrated goodjudgment.”Something’s wrong. Haymitch’s trying a little too hard to cheer me up. It’s notreally his style. “So who else volunteered?”“I think there were seven altogether,” he says evasively.I get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. “Who else, Haymitch?” I insist.Haymitch finally drops the good-natured act. “You know who else, Katniss. Youknow who stepped up first.”Of course I do.Gale."},{"pageContent":"12 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_12]Today I might lose both of them.I try to imagine a world where both Gale’s and Peeta’s voices have ceased. Handsstilled. Eyes unblinking. I’m standing over their bodies, having a last look,leaving the room where they lie. But when I open the door to step out into theworld, there’s only a tremendous void. A pale gray nothingness that is all myfuture holds.“Do you want me to have them sedate you until it’s over?” asks Haymitch. He’snot joking. This is a man who spent his adult life at the bottom of a bottle,trying to anesthetize himself against the Capitol’s crimes. The sixteen-year-oldboy who won the second Quarter Quell must have had people he loved—family,friends, a sweetheart maybe—that he fought to get back to. Where are they now?How is it that until Peeta and I were thrust upon him, there was no one at allin his life? What did Snow do to them?“No,” I say. “I want to go to the Capitol. I want to be part of the rescuemission.”“They’re gone,” says Haymitch.“How long ago did they leave? I could catch up. I could—” What? What could I do?Haymitch shakes his head. “It’ll never happen. You’re too valuable and toovulnerable. There was talk of sending you to another district to divert theCapitol’s attention while the rescue takes place. But no one felt you couldhandle it.”“Please, Haymitch!” I’m begging now. “I have to do something. I can’t just sithere waiting to hear if they died. There must be something I can do!”“All right. Let me talk to Plutarch. You stay put.” But I can’t. Haymitch’sfootsteps are still echoing in the outer hall when I fumble my way through theslit in the dividing curtain to find Finnick sprawled out on his stomach, hishands twisted in his pillowcase. Although it’s cowardly—cruel even—to rouse himfrom the shadowy, muted drug land to stark reality, I go ahead and do it becauseI can’t stand to face this by myself.As I explain our situation, his initial agitation mysteriously ebbs. “Don’t yousee, Katniss, this will decide things. One way or the other. By the end of theday, they’ll either be dead or with us. It’s…it’s more than we could hope for!”Well, that’s a sunny view of our situation. And yet there’s something calmingabout the idea that this torment could come to an end.The curtain yanks back and there’s Haymitch. He has a job for us, if we can pullit together. They still need post-bombing footage of 13. “If we can get it inthe next few hours, Beetee can air it leading up to the rescue, and maybe keepthe Capitol’s attention elsewhere.”“Yes, a distraction,” says Finnick. “A decoy of sorts.”“What we really need is something so riveting that even President Snow won’t beable to tear himself away. Got anything like that?” asks Haymitch.Having a job that might help the mission snaps me into focus. While I knock downbreakfast and get prepped, I try to think of what I might say. President Snowmust be wondering how that blood-splattered floor and his roses are affectingme. If he wants me broken, then I will have to be whole. But I don’t think Iwill convince him of anything by shouting a couple of defiant lines at thecamera. Besides, that won’t buy the rescue team any time. Outbursts are short.It’s stories that take time.I don’t know if it will work, but when the television crew’s all assembledaboveground, I ask Cressida if she could start out by asking me about Peeta. Itake a seat on the fallen marble pillar where I had my breakdown, wait for thered light and Cressida’s question.“How did you meet Peeta?” she asks.And then I do the thing that Haymitch has wanted since my first interview. Iopen up. “When I met Peeta, I was eleven years old, and I was almost dead.” Italk about that awful day when I tried to sell the baby clothes in the rain, howPeeta’s mother chased me from the bakery door, and how he took a beating tobring me the loaves of bread that saved our lives. “We had never even spoken.The first time I ever talked to Peeta was on the train to the Games.”“But he was already in love with you,” says Cressida.“I guess so.” I allow myself a small smile.“How are you doing with the separation?” she asks.“Not well. I know at any moment Snow could kill him. Especially since he warnedThirteen about the bombing. It’s a terrible thing to live with,” I say. “Butbecause of what they’re putting him through, I don’t have any reservationsanymore. About doing whatever it takes to destroy the Capitol. I’m finallyfree.” I turn my gaze skyward and watch the flight of a hawk across the sky.“President Snow once admitted to me that the Capitol was fragile. At the time, Ididn’t know what he meant. It was hard to see clearly because I was so afraid.Now I’m not. The Capitol’s fragile because it depends on the districts foreverything. Food, energy, even the Peacekeepers that police us. If we declareour freedom, the Capitol collapses. President Snow, thanks to you, I’mofficially declaring mine today.”I’ve been sufficient, if not dazzling. Everyone loves the bread story. But it’smy message to President Snow that gets the wheels spinning in Plutarch’s brain.He hastily calls Finnick and Haymitch over and they have a brief but intenseconversation that I can see Haymitch isn’t happy with. Plutarch seems towin—Finnick’s pale but nodding his head by the end of it.As Finnick moves to take my seat before the camera, Haymitch tells him, “Youdon’t have to do this.”“Yes, I do. If it will help her.” Finnick balls up his rope in his hand. “I’mready.”I don’t know what to expect. A love story about Annie? An account of the abusesin District 4? But Finnick Odair takes a completely different tack.“President Snow used to…sell me…my body, that is,” Finnick begins in a flat,removed tone. “I wasn’t the only one. If a victor is considered desirable, thepresident gives them as a reward or allows people to buy them for an exorbitantamount of money. If you refuse, he kills someone you love. So you do it.”That explains it, then. Finnick’s parade of lovers in the Capitol. They werenever real lovers. Just people like our old Head Peacekeeper, Cray, who boughtdesperate girls to devour and discard because he could. I want to interrupt thetaping and beg Finnick’s forgiveness for every false thought I’ve ever had abouthim. But we have a job to do, and I sense Finnick’s role will be far moreeffective than mine.“I wasn’t the only one, but I was the most popular,” he says. “And perhaps themost defenseless, because the people I loved were so defenseless. To makethemselves feel better, my patrons would make presents of money or jewelry, butI found a much more valuable form of payment.”Secrets, I think. That’s what Finnick told me his lovers paid him in, only Ithought the whole arrangement was by his choice.“Secrets,” he says, echoing my thoughts. “And this is where you’re going to wantto stay tuned, President Snow, because so very many of them were about you. Butlet’s begin with some of the others.”Finnick begins to weave a tapestry so rich in detail that you can’t doubt itsauthenticity. Tales of strange sexual appetites, betrayals of the heart,bottomless greed, and bloody power plays. Drunken secrets whispered over damppillow-cases in the dead of night. Finnick was someone bought and sold. Adistrict slave. A handsome one, certainly, but in reality, harmless. Who wouldhe tell? And who would believe him if he did? But some secrets are too deliciousnot to share. I don’t know the people Finnick names—all seem to be prominentCapitol citizens—but I know, from listening to the chatter of my prep team, theattention the most mild slip in judgment can draw. If a bad haircut can lead tohours of gossip, what will charges of incest, back-stabbing, blackmail, andarson produce? Even as the waves of shock and recrimination roll over theCapitol, the people there will be waiting, as I am now, to hear about thepresident.“And now, on to our good President Coriolanus Snow,” says Finnick. “Such a youngman when he rose to power. Such a clever one to keep it. How, you must askyourself, did he do it? One word. That’s all you really need to know. Poison.”Finnick goes back to Snow’s political ascension, which I know nothing of, andworks his way up to the present, pointing out case after case of the mysteriousdeaths of Snow’s adversaries or, even worse, his allies who had the potential tobecome threats. People dropping dead at a feast or slowly, inexplicablydeclining into shadows over a period of months. Blamed on bad shellfish, elusiveviruses, or an overlooked weakness in the aorta. Snow drinking from the poisonedcup himself to deflect suspicion. But antidotes don’t always work. They saythat’s why he wears the roses that reek of perfume. They say it’s to cover thescent of blood from the mouth sores that will never heal. They say, they say,they say…Snow has a list and no one knows who will be next.Poison. The perfect weapon for a snake.Since my opinion of the Capitol and its noble president are already so low, Ican’t say Finnick’s allegations shock me. They seem to have far more effect onthe displaced Capitol rebels like my crew and Fulvia—even Plutarch occasionallyreacts in surprise, maybe wondering how a specific tidbit passed him by. WhenFinnick finishes, they just keep the cameras rolling until finally he has to bethe one to say “Cut.”The crew hurries inside to edit the material, and Plutarch leads Finnick off fora chat, probably to see if he has any more stories. I’m left with Haymitch inthe rubble, wondering if Finnick’s fate would have one day been mine. Why not?Snow could have gotten a really good price for the girl on fire.“Is that what happened to you?” I ask Haymitch.“No. My mother and younger brother. My girl. They were all dead two weeks afterI was crowned victor. Because of that stunt I pulled with the force field,” heanswers. “Snow had no one to use against me.”“I’m surprised he didn’t just kill you,” I say.“Oh, no. I was the example. The person to hold up to the young Finnicks andJohannas and Cashmeres. Of what could happen to a victor who caused problems,”says Haymitch. “But he knew he had no leverage against me.”“Until Peeta and I came along,” I say softly. I don’t even get a shrug inreturn.With our job done, there’s nothing left for Finnick and me to do but wait. Wetry to fill the dragging minutes in Special Defense. Tie knots. Push our luncharound our bowls. Blow things up on the shooting range. Because of the danger ofdetection, no communication comes from the rescue team. At 15:00, the designatedhour, we stand tense and silent in the back of a room full of screens andcomputers and watch Beetee and his team try to dominate the airwaves. His usualfidgety distraction is replaced with a determination I have never seen. Most ofmy interview doesn’t make the cut, just enough to show I am alive and stilldefiant. It is Finnick’s salacious and gory account of the Capitol that takesthe day. Is Beetee’s skill improving? Or are his counterparts in the Capitol alittle too fascinated to want to tune Finnick out? For the next sixty minutes,the Capitol feed alternates between the standard afternoon newscast, Finnick,and attempts to black it all out. But the rebel techno team manages to overrideeven the latter and, in a real coup, keeps control for almost the entire attackon Snow.“Let it go!” says Beetee, throwing up his hands, relinquishing the broadcastback to the Capitol. He mops his face with a cloth. “If they’re not out of thereby now, they’re all dead.” He spins in his chair to see Finnick and me reactingto his words. “It was a good plan, though. Did Plutarch show it to you?”Of course not. Beetee takes us to another room and shows us how the team, withthe help of rebel insiders, will attempt—has attempted—to free the victors froman underground prison. It seems to have involved knockout gas distributed by theventilation system, a power failure, the detonation of a bomb in a governmentbuilding several miles from the prison, and now the disruption of the broadcast.Beetee’s glad we find the plan hard to follow, because then our enemies will,too.“Like your electricity trap in the arena?” I ask.“Exactly. And see how well that worked out?” says Beetee.Well…not really, I think.Finnick and I try to station ourselves in Command, where surely first word ofthe rescue will come, but we are barred because serious war business is beingcarried out. We refuse to leave Special Defense and end up waiting in thehummingbird room for news.Making knots. Making knots. No word. Making knots. Tick-tock. This is a clock.Do not think of Gale. Do not think of Peeta. Making knots. We do not wantdinner. Fingers raw and bleeding. Finnick finally gives up and assumes thehunched position he took in the arena when the jabberjays attacked. I perfect myminiature noose. The words of “The Hanging Tree” replay in my head. Gale andPeeta. Peeta and Gale.“Did you love Annie right away, Finnick?” I ask.“No.” A long time passes before he adds, “She crept up on me.”I search my heart, but at the moment the only person I can feel creeping up onme is Snow.It must be midnight, it must be tomorrow when Haymitch pushes open the door.“They’re back. We’re wanted in the hospital.” My mouth opens with a flood ofquestions that he cuts off with “That’s all I know.”I want to run, but Finnick’s acting so strange, as if he’s lost the ability tomove, so I take his hand and lead him like a small child. Through SpecialDefense, into the elevator that goes this way and that, and on to the hospitalwing. The place is in an uproar, with doctors shouting orders and the woundedbeing wheeled through the halls in their beds.We’re sideswiped by a gurney bearing an unconscious, emaciated young woman witha shaved head. Her flesh shows bruises and oozing scabs. Johanna Mason. Whoactually knew rebel secrets. At least the one about me. And this is how she haspaid for it.Through a doorway, I catch a glimpse of Gale, stripped to the waist,perspiration streaming down his face as a doctor removes something from underhis shoulder blade with a long pair of tweezers. Wounded, but alive. I call hisname, start toward him until a nurse pushes me back and shuts me out.“Finnick!” Something between a shriek and a cry of joy. A lovely if somewhatbedraggled young woman—dark tangled hair, sea green eyes—runs toward us innothing but a sheet. “Finnick!” And suddenly, it’s as if there’s no one in theworld but these two, crashing through space to reach each other. They collide,enfold, lose their balance, and slam against a wall, where they stay. Clinginginto one being. Indivisible.A pang of jealousy hits me. Not for either Finnick or Annie but for theircertainty. No one seeing them could doubt their love.Boggs, looking a little worse for wear but uninjured, finds Haymitch and me. “Wegot them all out. Except Enobaria. But since she’s from Two, we doubt she’sbeing held anyway. Peeta’s at the end of the hall. The effects of the gas arejust wearing off. You should be there when he wakes.”Peeta.Alive and well—maybe not well but alive and here. Away from Snow. Safe. Here.With me. In a minute I can touch him. See his smile. Hear his laugh.Haymitch’s grinning at me. “Come on, then,” he says.I’m light-headed with giddiness. What will I say? Oh, who cares what I say?Peeta will be ecstatic no matter what I do. He’ll probably be kissing me anyway.I wonder if it will feel like those last kisses on the beach in the arena, theones I haven’t dared let myself consider until this moment.Peeta’s awake already, sitting on the side of the bed, looking bewildered as atrio of doctors reassure him, flash lights in his eyes, check his pulse. I’mdisappointed that mine was not the first face he saw when he woke, but he seesit now. His features register disbelief and something more intense that I can’tquite place. Desire? Desperation? Surely both, for he sweeps the doctors aside,leaps to his feet, and moves toward me. I run to meet him, my arms extended toembrace him. His hands are reaching for me, too, to caress my face, I think.My lips are just forming his name when his fingers lock around my throat."},{"pageContent":"13 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_13]The cold collar chafes my neck and makes the shivering even harder to control.At least I am no longer in the claustrophobic tube, while the machines click andwhir around me, listening to a disembodied voice telling me to hold still whileI try to convince myself I can still breathe. Even now, when I’ve been assuredthere will be no permanent damage, I hunger for air.The medical team’s main concerns—damage to my spinal cord, airway, veins, andarteries—have been allayed. Bruising, hoarseness, the sore larynx, this strangelittle cough—not to be worried about. It will all be fine. The Mockingjay willnot lose her voice. Where, I want to ask, is the doctor who determines if I amlosing my mind? Only I’m not supposed to talk right now. I can’t even thankBoggs when he comes to check on me. To look me over and tell me he’s seen a lotworse injuries among the soldiers when they teach choke holds in training.It was Boggs who knocked out Peeta with one blow before any permanent damagecould be done. I know Haymitch would have come to my defense if he hadn’t beenutterly unprepared. To catch both Haymitch and myself off guard is a rare thing.But we have been so consumed with saving Peeta, so tortured by having him in theCapitol’s hands, that the elation at having him back blinded us. If I’d had aprivate reunion with Peeta, he would have killed me. Now that he’s deranged.No, not deranged, I remind myself. Hijacked. That’s the word I heard passbetween Plutarch and Haymitch as I was wheeled past them in the hallway.Hijacked. I don’t know what it means.Prim, who appeared moments after the attack and has stayed as close to me aspossible ever since, spreads another blanket over me. “I think they’ll take thecollar off soon, Katniss. You won’t be so cold then.” My mother, who’s beenassisting in a complicated surgery, has still not been informed of Peeta’sassault. Prim takes one of my hands, which is clutched in a fist, and massagesit until it opens and blood begins to flow through my fingers again. She’sstarting on the second fist when the doctors show up, remove the collar, andgive me a shot of something for pain and swelling. I lie, as instructed, with myhead still, not aggravating the injuries to my neck.Plutarch, Haymitch, and Beetee have been waiting in the hall for the doctors togive them clearance to see me. I don’t know if they’ve told Gale, but since he’snot here, I assume they haven’t. Plutarch ushers the doctors out and tries toorder Prim to go as well, but she says, “No. If you force me to leave, I’ll godirectly to surgery and tell my mother everything that’s happened. And I warnyou, she doesn’t think much of a Gamemaker calling the shots on Katniss’s life.Especially when you’ve taken such poor care of her.”Plutarch looks offended, but Haymitch chuckles. “I’d let it go, Plutarch,” hesays. Prim stays.“So, Katniss, Peeta’s condition has come as a shock to all of us,” saysPlutarch. “We couldn’t help but notice his deterioration in the last twointerviews. Obviously, he’d been abused, and we put his psychological state downto that. Now we believe something more was going on. That the Capitol has beensubjecting him to a rather uncommon technique known as hijacking. Beetee?”“I’m sorry,” Beetee says, “but I can’t tell you all the specifics of it,Katniss. The Capitol’s very secretive about this form of torture, and I believethe results are inconsistent. This we do know. It’s a type of fear conditioning.The term hijack comes from an old English word that means ‘to capture,’ or evenbetter, ‘seize.’ We believe it was chosen because the technique involves the useof tracker jacker venom, and the jack suggested hijack. You were stung in yourfirst Hunger Games, so unlike most of us, you have firsthand knowledge of theeffects of the venom.”Terror. Hallucinations. Nightmarish visions of losing those I love. Because thevenom targets the part of the brain that houses fear.“I’m sure you remember how frightening it was. Did you also suffer mentalconfusion in the aftermath?” asks Beetee. “A sense of being unable to judge whatwas true and what was false? Most people who have been stung and lived to tellabout it report something of the kind.”Yes. That encounter with Peeta. Even after I was clearheaded, I wasn’t sure ifhe had saved my life by taking on Cato or if I’d imagined it.“Recall is made more difficult because memories can be changed.” Beetee taps hisforehead. “Brought to the forefront of your mind, altered, and saved again inthe revised form. Now imagine that I ask you to remember something—either with averbal suggestion or by making you watch a tape of the event—and while thatexperience is refreshed, I give you a dose of tracker jacker venom. Not enoughto induce a three-day blackout. Just enough to infuse the memory with fear anddoubt. And that’s what your brain puts in long-term storage.”I start to feel sick. Prim asks the question that’s in my mind. “Is that whatthey’ve done to Peeta? Taken his memories of Katniss and distorted them sothey’re scary?”Beetee nods. “So scary that he’d see her as life-threatening. That he might tryto kill her. Yes, that’s our current theory.”I cover my face with my arms because this isn’t happening. It isn’t possible.For someone to make Peeta forget he loves me…no one could do that.“But you can reverse it, right?” asks Prim.“Um…very little data on that,” says Plutarch. “None, really. If hijackingrehabilitation has been attempted before, we have no access to those records.”“Well, you’re going to try, aren’t you?” Prim persists. “You’re not just goingto lock him up in some padded room and leave him to suffer?”“Of course, we’ll try, Prim,” says Beetee. “It’s just, we don’t know to whatdegree we’ll succeed. If any. My guess is that fearful events are the hardest toroot out. They’re the ones we naturally remember the best, after all.”“And apart from his memories of Katniss, we don’t yet know what else has beentampered with,” says Plutarch. “We’re putting together a team of mental healthand military professionals to come up with a counterattack. I, personally, feeloptimistic that he’ll make a full recovery.”“Do you?” asks Prim caustically. “And what do you think, Haymitch?”I shift my arms slightly so I can see his expression through the crack. He’sexhausted and discouraged as he admits, “I think Peeta might get somewhatbetter. But…I don’t think he’ll ever be the same.” I snap my arms back together,closing the crack, shutting them all out.“At least he’s alive,” says Plutarch, as if he’s losing patience with the lot ofus. “Snow executed Peeta’s stylist and his prep team on live television tonight.We’ve no idea what happened to Effie Trinket. Peeta’s damaged, but he’s here.With us. And that’s a definite improvement over his situation twelve hours ago.Let’s keep that in mind, all right?”Plutarch’s attempt to cheer me up—laced with the news of another four, possiblyfive, murders—somehow backfires. Portia. Peeta’s prep team. Effie. The effort tofight back tears makes my throat throb until I’m gasping again. Eventually, theyhave no choice but to sedate me.When I wake, I wonder if this will be the only way I sleep now, with drugs shotinto my arm. I’m glad I’m not supposed to talk for the next few days, becausethere’s nothing I want to say. Or do. In fact, I’m a model patient, my lethargytaken for restraint, obedience to the doctors’ orders. I no longer feel likecrying. In fact, I can only manage to hold on to one simple thought: an image ofSnow’s face accompanied by the whisper in my head. I will kill you.My mother and Prim take turns nursing me, coaxing me to swallow bites of softfood. People come in periodically to give me updates on Peeta’s condition. Thehigh levels of tracker jacker venom are working their way out of his body. He’sbeing treated only by strangers, natives of 13—no one from home or the Capitolhas been allowed to see him—to keep any dangerous memories from triggering. Ateam of specialists works long hours designing a strategy for his recovery.Gale’s not supposed to visit me, as he’s confined to bed with some kind ofshoulder wound. But on the third night, after I’ve been medicated and the lightsturned down low for bedtime, he slips silently into my room. He doesn’t speak,just runs his fingers over the bruises on my neck with a touch as light as mothwings, plants a kiss between my eyes, and disappears.The next morning, I’m discharged from the hospital with instructions to movequietly and speak only when necessary. I’m not imprinted with a schedule, so Iwander around aimlessly until Prim’s excused from her hospital duties to take meto our family’s latest compartment. 2212. Identical to the last one, but with nowindow.Buttercup has now been issued a daily food allowance and a pan of sand that’skept under the bathroom sink. As Prim tucks me into bed, he hops up on mypillow, vying for her attention. She cradles him but stays focused on me.“Katniss, I know this whole thing with Peeta is terrible for you. But remember,Snow worked on him for weeks, and we’ve only had him for a few days. There’s achance that the old Peeta, the one who loves you, is still inside. Trying to getback to you. Don’t give up on him.”I look at my little sister and think how she has inherited the best qualitiesour family has to offer: my mother’s healing hands, my father’s level head, andmy fight. There’s something else there as well, something entirely her own. Anability to look into the confusing mess of life and see things for what theyare. Is it possible she could be right? That Peeta could return to me?“I have to get back to the hospital,” Prim says, placing Buttercup on the bedbeside me. “You two keep each other company, okay?”Buttercup springs off the bed and follows her to the door, complaining loudlywhen he’s left behind. We’re about as much company for each other as dirt. Aftermaybe thirty seconds, I know I can’t stand being confined in the subterraneancell, and leave Buttercup to his own devices. I get lost several times, buteventually I make my way down to Special Defense. Everyone I pass stares at thebruises, and I can’t help feeling self-conscious to the point that I tug mycollar up to my ears.Gale must have been released from the hospital this morning as well, because Ifind him in one of the research rooms with Beetee. They’re immersed, heads bentover a drawing, taking a measurement. Versions of the picture litter the tableand floor. Tacked on the corkboard walls and occupying several computer screensare other designs of some sort. In the rough lines of one, I recognize Gale’stwitch-up snare. “What are these?” I ask hoarsely, pulling their attention fromthe sheet.“Ah, Katniss, you’ve found us out,” says Beetee cheerfully.“What? Is this a secret?” I know Gale’s been down here working with Beetee alot, but I assumed they were messing around with bows and guns.“Not really. But I’ve felt a little guilty about it. Stealing Gale away from youso much,” Beetee admits.Since I’ve spent most of my time in 13 disoriented, worried, angry, beingremade, or hospitalized, I can’t say Gale’s absences have inconvenienced me.Things haven’t been exactly harmonious between us, either. But I let Beeteethink he owes me. “I hope you’ve been putting his time to good use.”“Come and see,” he says, waving me over to a computer screen.This is what they’ve been doing. Taking the fundamental ideas behind Gale’straps and adapting them into weapons against humans. Bombs mostly. It’s lessabout the mechanics of the traps than the psychology behind them. Booby-trappingan area that provides something essential to survival. A water or food supply.Frightening prey so that a large number flee into a greater destruction.Endangering off-spring in order to draw in the actual desired target, theparent. Luring the victim into what appears to be a safe haven—where deathawaits it. At some point, Gale and Beetee left the wilderness behind and focusedon more human impulses. Like compassion. A bomb explodes. Time is allowed forpeople to rush to the aid of the wounded. Then a second, more powerful bombkills them as well.“That seems to be crossing some kind of line,” I say. “So anything goes?” Theyboth stare at me—Beetee with doubt, Gale with hostility. “I guess there isn’t arule book for what might be unacceptable to do to another human being.”“Sure there is. Beetee and I have been following the same rule book PresidentSnow used when he hijacked Peeta,” says Gale.Cruel, but to the point. I leave without further comment. I feel if I don’t getoutside immediately, I’ll just go ballistic, but I’m still in Special Defensewhen I’m waylaid by Haymitch. “Come on,” he says. “We need you back up at thehospital.”“What for?” I ask.“They’re going to try something on Peeta,” he answers. “Send in the mostinnocuous person from Twelve they can come up with. Find someone Peeta mightshare childhood memories with, but nothing too close to you. They’re screeningpeople now.”I know this will be a difficult task, since anyone Peeta shares childhoodmemories with would most likely be from town, and almost none of those peopleescaped the flames. But when we reach the hospital room that has been turnedinto a work space for Peeta’s recovery team, there she sits chatting withPlutarch. Delly Cartwright. As always, she gives me a smile that suggests I’mher best friend in the world. She gives this smile to everyone. “Katniss!” shecalls out.“Hey, Delly,” I say. I’d heard she and her younger brother had survived. Herparents, who ran the shoe shop in town, weren’t as lucky. She looks older,wearing the drab 13 clothes that flatter no one, with her long yellow hair in apractical braid instead of curls. Delly’s a bit thinner than I remember, but shewas one of the few kids in District 12 with a couple of pounds to spare. Thediet here, the stress, the grief of losing her parents have all, no doubt,contributed. “How are you doing?” I ask.“Oh, it’s been a lot of changes all at once.” Her eyes fill with tears. “Buteveryone’s really nice here in Thirteen, don’t you think?”Delly means it. She genuinely likes people. All people, not just a select fewshe’s spent years making up her mind about.“They’ve made an effort to make us feel welcome,” I say. I think that’s a fairstatement without going overboard. “Are you the one they’ve picked to seePeeta?”“I guess so. Poor Peeta. Poor you. I’ll never understand the Capitol,” she says.“Better not to, maybe,” I tell her.“Delly’s known Peeta for a long time,” says Plutarch.“Oh, yes!” Delly’s face brightens. “We played together from when we were little.I used to tell people he was my brother.”“What do you think?” Haymitch asks me. “Anything that might trigger memories ofyou?”“We were all in the same class. But we never overlapped much,” I say.“Katniss was always so amazing, I never dreamed she would notice me,” saysDelly. “The way she could hunt and go in the Hob and everything. Everyoneadmired her so.”Haymitch and I both have to take a hard look at her face to double-check ifshe’s joking. To hear Delly describe it, I had next to no friends because Iintimidated people by being so exceptional. Not true. I had next to no friendsbecause I wasn’t friendly. Leave it to Delly to spin me into somethingwonderful.“Delly always thinks the best of everyone,” I explain. “I don’t think Peetacould have bad memories associated with her.” Then I remember. “Wait. In theCapitol. When I lied about recognizing the Avox girl. Peeta covered for me andsaid she looked like Delly.”“I remember,” says Haymitch. “But I don’t know. It wasn’t true. Delly wasn’tactually there. I don’t think it can compete with years of childhood memories.”“Especially with such a pleasant companion as Delly,” says Plutarch. “Let’s giveit a shot.”Plutarch, Haymitch, and I go to the observation room next to where Peeta’sconfined. It’s crowded with ten members of his recovery team armed with pens andclipboards. The one-way glass and audio setup allow us to watch Peeta secretly.He lies on the bed, his arms strapped down. He doesn’t fight the restraints, buthis hands fidget continuously. His expression seems more lucid than when hetried to strangle me, but it’s still not one that belongs to him.When the door quietly opens, his eyes widen in alarm, then become confused.Delly crosses the room tentatively, but as she nears him she naturally breaksinto a smile. “Peeta? It’s Delly. From home.”“Delly?” Some of the clouds seem to clear. “Delly. It’s you.”“Yes!” she says with obvious relief. “How do you feel?”“Awful. Where are we? What’s happened?” asks Peeta.“Here we go,” says Haymitch.“I told her to steer clear of any mention of Katniss or the Capitol,” saysPlutarch. “Just see how much of home she could conjure up.”“Well…we’re in District Thirteen. We live here now,” says Delly.“That’s what those people have been saying. But it makes no sense. Why aren’t wehome?” asks Peeta.Delly bites her lip. “There was…an accident. I miss home badly, too. I was onlyjust thinking about those chalk drawings we used to do on the paving stones.Yours were so wonderful. Remember when you made each one a different animal?”“Yeah. Pigs and cats and things,” says Peeta. “You said…about an accident?”I can see the sheen of sweat on Delly’s forehead as she tries to work around thequestion. “It was bad. No one…could stay,” she says haltingly.“Hang in there, girl,” says Haymitch.“But I know you’re going to like it here, Peeta. The people have been reallynice to us. There’s always food and clean clothes, and school’s much moreinteresting,” says Delly.“Why hasn’t my family come to see me?” Peeta asks.“They can’t.” Delly’s tearing up again. “A lot of people didn’t get out ofTwelve. So we’ll need to make a new life here. I’m sure they could use a goodbaker. Do you remember when your father used to let us make dough girls andboys?”“There was a fire,” Peeta says suddenly.“Yes,” she whispers.“Twelve burned down, didn’t it? Because of her,” says Peeta angrily. “Because ofKatniss!” He begins to pull on the restraints.“Oh, no, Peeta. It wasn’t her fault,” says Delly.“Did she tell you that?” he hisses at her.“Get her out of there,” says Plutarch. The door opens immediately and Dellybegins to back toward it slowly.“She didn’t have to. I was—” Delly begins.“Because she’s lying! She’s a liar! You can’t believe anything she says! She’ssome kind of mutt the Capitol created to use against the rest of us!” Peetashouts.“No, Peeta. She’s not a—” Delly tries again.“Don’t trust her, Delly,” says Peeta in a frantic voice. “I did, and she triedto kill me. She killed my friends. My family. Don’t even go near her! She’s amutt!”A hand reaches through the doorway, pulls Delly out, and the door swings shut.But Peeta keeps yelling. “A mutt! She’s a stinking mutt!”Not only does he hate me and want to kill me, he no longer believes I’m human.It was less painful being strangled.Around me the recovery team members scribble like crazy, taking down every word.Haymitch and Plutarch grab my arms and propel me out of the room. They lean meup against a wall in the silent hallway. But I know Peeta continues to screambehind the door and the glass.Prim was wrong. Peeta is irretrievable. “I can’t stay here anymore,” I saynumbly. “If you want me to be the Mockingjay, you’ll have to send me away.”“Where do you want to go?” asks Haymitch.“The Capitol.” It’s the only place I can think of where I have a job to do.“Can’t do it,” Plutarch says. “Not until all the districts are secure. Good newsis, the fighting’s almost over in all of them but Two. It’s a tough nut tocrack, though.”That’s right. First the districts. Next the Capitol. And then I hunt down Snow.“Fine,” I say. “Send me to Two.”"},{"pageContent":"14 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_14]District 2 is a large district, as one might expect, composed of a series ofvillages spread across the mountains. Each was originally associated with a mineor quarry, although now, many are devoted to the housing and training ofPeacekeepers. None of this would present much of a challenge, since the rebelshave 13’s airpower on their side, except for one thing: At the center of thedistrict is a virtually impenetrable mountain that houses the heart of theCapitol’s military.We’ve nicknamed the mountain the Nut since I relayed Plutarch’s “tough nut tocrack” comment to the weary and discouraged rebel leaders here. The Nut wasestablished directly after the Dark Days, when the Capitol had lost 13 and wasdesperate for a new underground stronghold. They had some of their militaryresources situated on the outskirts of the Capitol itself—nuclear missiles,aircraft, troops—but a significant chunk of their power was now under an enemy’scontrol. Of course, there was no way they could hope to replicate 13, which wasthe work of centuries. However, in the old mines of nearby District 2, they sawopportunity. From the air, the Nut appeared to be just another mountain with afew entrances on its faces. But inside were vast cavernous spaces where slabs ofstones had been cut, hauled to the surface, and transported down slippery narrowroads to make distant buildings. There was even a train system to facilitatetransporting the miners from the Nut to the very center of the main town inDistrict 2. It ran right to the square that Peeta and I visited during theVictory Tour, standing on the wide marble steps of the Justice Building, tryingnot to look too closely at Cato’s and Clove’s grieving families assembled belowus.It was not the most ideal terrain, plagued as it was by mudslides, floods, andavalanches. But the advantages outweighed the concerns. As they’d cut deep intothe mountain, the miners had left large pillars and walls of stone to supportthe infrastructure. The Capitol reinforced these and set about making themountain their new military base. Filling it with computer banks and meetingrooms, barracks and arsenals. Widening entrances to allow the exit of hovercraftfrom the hangar, installing missile launchers. But on the whole, leaving theexterior of the mountain largely unchanged. A rough, rocky tangle of trees andwildlife. A natural fortress to protect them from their enemies.By the other districts’ standards, the Capitol babied the inhabitants here. Justby looking at the District 2 rebels, you can tell they were decently fed andcared for in childhood. Some did end up as quarry and mine workers. Others wereeducated for jobs in the Nut or funneled into the ranks of Peacekeepers. Trainedyoung and hard for combat. The Hunger Games were an opportunity for wealth and akind of glory not seen elsewhere. Of course, the people of 2 swallowed theCapitol’s propaganda more easily than the rest of us. Embraced their ways. Butfor all that, at the end of the day, they were still slaves. And if that waslost on the citizens who became Peacekeepers or worked in the Nut, it was notlost on the stonecutters who formed the backbone of the resistance here.Things stand as they did when I arrived two weeks ago. The outer villages are inrebel hands, the town divided, and the Nut is as untouchable as ever. Its fewentrances heavily fortified, its heart safely enfolded in the mountain. Whileevery other district has now wrested control from the Capitol, 2 remains in itspocket.Each day, I do whatever I can to help. Visit the wounded. Tape short propos withmy camera crew. I’m not allowed in actual combat, but they invite me to themeetings on the status of the war, which is a lot more than they did in 13. It’smuch better here. Freer, no schedules on my arm, fewer demands on my time. Ilive aboveground in the rebel villages or surrounding caves. For safety’s sake,I’m relocated often. During the day, I’ve been given clearance to hunt as longas I take a guard along and don’t stray too far. In the thin, cold mountain air,I feel some physical strength returning, my mind clearing away the rest of thefogginess. But with this mental clarity comes an even sharper awareness of whathas been done to Peeta.Snow has stolen him from me, twisted him beyond recognition, and made me apresent of him. Boggs, who came to 2 when I did, told me that even with all theplotting, it was a little too easy to rescue Peeta. He believes if 13 hadn’tmade the effort, Peeta would’ve been delivered to me anyway. Dropped off in anactively warring district or perhaps 13 itself. Tied up with ribbons and taggedwith my name. Programmed to murder me.It’s only now that he’s been corrupted that I can fully appreciate the realPeeta. Even more than I would’ve if he’d died. The kindness, the steadiness, thewarmth that had an unexpected heat behind it. Outside of Prim, my mother, andGale, how many people in the world love me unconditionally? I think in my case,the answer may now be none. Sometimes when I’m alone, I take the pearl fromwhere it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread, thestrong arms that warded off nightmares on the train, the kisses in the arena. Tomake myself put a name to the thing I’ve lost. But what’s the use? It’s gone.He’s gone. Whatever existed between us is gone. All that’s left is my promise tokill Snow. I tell myself this ten times a day.Back in 13, Peeta’s rehabilitation continues. Even though I don’t ask, Plutarchgives me cheerful updates on the phone like “Good news, Katniss! I think we’vealmost got him convinced you’re not a mutt!” Or “Today he was allowed to feedhimself pudding!”When Haymitch gets on after, he admits Peeta’s no better. The only dubious rayof hope has come from my sister. “Prim came up with the idea of trying to hijackhim back,” Haymitch tells me. “Bring up the distorted memories of you and thengive him a big dose of a calming drug, like morphling. We’ve only tried it onone memory. The tape of the two of you in the cave, when you told him that storyabout getting Prim the goat.”“Any improvement?” I ask.“Well, if extreme confusion is an improvement over extreme terror, then yes,”says Haymitch. “But I’m not sure it is. He lost the ability to speak for severalhours. Went into some sort of stupor. When he came out, the only thing he askedabout was the goat.”“Right,” I say.“How’s it out there?” he asks.“No forward motion,” I tell him.“We’re sending out a team to help with the mountain. Beetee and some of theothers,” he says. “You know, the brains.”When the brains are selected, I’m not surprised to see Gale’s name on the list.I thought Beetee would bring him, not for his technological expertise, but inthe hopes that he could somehow think of a way to ensnare a mountain.Originally, Gale offered to come with me to 2, but I could see I was tearing himaway from his work with Beetee. I told him to sit tight and stay where he wasmost needed. I didn’t tell him his presence would make it even more difficultfor me to mourn Peeta.Gale finds me when they arrive late one afternoon. I’m sitting on a log at theedge of my current village, plucking a goose. A dozen or so of the birds arepiled at my feet. Great flocks of them have been migrating through here sinceI’ve arrived, and the pickings are easy. Without a word, Gale settles beside meand begins to relieve a bird of its feathers. We’re through about half when hesays, “Any chance we’ll get to eat these?”“Yeah. Most go to the camp kitchen, but they expect me to give a couple towhoever I’m staying with tonight,” I say. “For keeping me.”“Isn’t the honor of the thing enough?” he says.“You’d think,” I reply. “But word’s gotten out that mockingjays are hazardous toyour health.”We pluck in silence for a while longer. Then he says, “I saw Peeta yesterday.Through the glass.”“What’d you think?” I ask.“Something selfish,” says Gale.“That you don’t have to be jealous of him anymore?” My fingers give a yank, anda cloud of feathers floats down around us.“No. Just the opposite.” Gale pulls a feather out of my hair. “I thought…I’llnever compete with that. No matter how much pain I’m in.” He spins the featherbetween his thumb and forefinger. “I don’t stand a chance if he doesn’t getbetter. You’ll never be able to let him go. You’ll always feel wrong about beingwith me.”“The way I always felt wrong kissing him because of you,” I say.Gale holds my gaze. “If I thought that was true, I could almost live with therest of it.”“It is true,” I admit. “But so is what you said about Peeta.”Gale makes a sound of exasperation. Nonetheless, after we’ve dropped off thebirds and volunteered to go back to the woods to gather kindling for the eveningfire, I find myself wrapped in his arms. His lips brushing the faded bruises onmy neck, working their way to my mouth. Despite what I feel for Peeta, this iswhen I accept deep down that he’ll never come back to me. Or I’ll never go backto him. I’ll stay in 2 until it falls, go to the Capitol and kill Snow, and thendie for my trouble. And he’ll die insane and hating me. So in the fading light Ishut my eyes and kiss Gale to make up for all the kisses I’ve withheld, andbecause it doesn’t matter anymore, and because I’m so desperately lonely I can’tstand it.Gale’s touch and taste and heat remind me that at least my body’s still alive,and for the moment it’s a welcome feeling. I empty my mind and let thesensations run through my flesh, happy to lose myself. When Gale pulls awayslightly, I move forward to close the gap, but I feel his hand under my chin.“Katniss,” he says. The instant I open my eyes, the world seems disjointed. Thisis not our woods or our mountains or our way. My hand automatically goes to thescar on my left temple, which I associate with confusion. “Now kiss me.”Bewildered, unblinking, I stand there while he leans in and presses his lips tomine briefly. He examines my face closely. “What’s going on in your head?”“I don’t know,” I whisper back.“Then it’s like kissing someone who’s drunk. It doesn’t count,” he says with aweak attempt at a laugh. He scoops up a pile of kindling and drops it in myempty arms, returning me to myself.“How do you know?” I say, mostly to cover my embarrassment. “Have you kissedsomeone who’s drunk?” I guess Gale could’ve been kissing girls right and leftback in 12. He certainly had enough takers. I never thought about it muchbefore.He just shakes his head. “No. But it’s not hard to imagine.”“So, you never kissed any other girls?” I ask.“I didn’t say that. You know, you were only twelve when we met. And a real painbesides. I did have a life outside of hunting with you,” he says, loading upwith firewood.Suddenly, I’m genuinely curious. “Who did you kiss? And where?”“Too many to remember. Behind the school, on the slag heap, you name it,” hesays.I roll my eyes. “So when did I become so special? When they carted me off to theCapitol?”“No. About six months before that. Right after New Year’s. We were in the Hob,eating some slop of Greasy Sae’s. And Darius was teasing you about trading arabbit for one of his kisses. And I realized…I minded,” he tells me.I remember that day. Bitter cold and dark by four in the afternoon. We’d beenhunting, but a heavy snow had driven us back into town. The Hob was crowded withpeople looking for refuge from the weather. Greasy Sae’s soup, made with stockfrom the bones of a wild dog we’d shot a week earlier, was below her usualstandards. Still, it was hot, and I was starving as I scooped it up, sittingcross-legged on her counter. Darius was leaning on the post of the stall,tickling my cheek with the end of my braid, while I smacked his hand away. Hewas explaining why one of his kisses merited a rabbit, or possibly two, sinceeveryone knows redheaded men are the most virile. And Greasy Sae and I werelaughing because he was so ridiculous and persistent and kept pointing out womenaround the Hob who he said had paid far more than a rabbit to enjoy his lips.“See? The one in the green muffler? Go ahead and ask her. If you need areference.”A million miles from here, a billion days ago, this happened. “Darius was justjoking around,” I say.“Probably. Although you’d be the last to figure out if he wasn’t,” Gale tellsme. “Take Peeta. Take me. Or even Finnick. I was starting to worry he had hiseye on you, but he seems back on track now.”“You don’t know Finnick if you think he’d love me,” I say.Gale shrugs. “I know he was desperate. That makes people do all kinds of crazythings.”I can’t help thinking that’s directed at me.Bright and early the next morning, the brains assemble to take on the problem ofthe Nut. I’m asked to the meeting, although I don’t have much to contribute. Iavoid the conference table and perch in the wide windowsill that has a view ofthe mountain in question. The commander from 2, a middle-aged woman named Lyme,takes us on a virtual tour of the Nut, its interior and fortifications, andrecounts the failed attempts to seize it. I’ve crossed paths with her briefly acouple of times since my arrival, and was dogged by the feeling I’d met herbefore. She’s memorable enough, standing over six feet tall and heavily muscled.But it’s only when I see a clip of her in the field, leading a raid on the mainentrance of the Nut, that something clicks and I realize I’m in the presence ofanother victor. Lyme, the tribute from District 2, who won her Hunger Games overa generation ago. Effie sent us her tape, among others, to prepare for theQuarter Quell. I’ve probably caught glimpses of her during the Games over theyears, but she’s kept a low profile. With my newfound knowledge of Haymitch’sand Finnick’s treatment, all I can think is: What did the Capitol do to herafter she won?When Lyme finishes the presentation, the questions from the brains begin. Hourspass, and lunch comes and goes, as they try to come up with a realistic plan fortaking the Nut. But while Beetee thinks he might be able to override certaincomputer systems, and there’s some discussion of putting the handful of internalspies to use, no one has any really innovative thoughts. As the afternoon wearson, talk keeps returning to a strategy that has been tried repeatedly—thestorming of the entrances. I can see Lyme’s frustration building because so manyvariations of this plan have already failed, so many of her soldiers have beenlost. Finally, she bursts out, “The next person who suggests we take theentrances better have a brilliant way to do it, because you’re going to be theone leading that mission!”Gale, who is too restless to sit at the table for more than a few hours, hasbeen alternating between pacing and sharing my windowsill. Early on, he seemedto accept Lyme’s assertion that the entrances couldn’t be taken, and dropped outof the conversation entirely. For the last hour or so, he’s sat quietly, hisbrow knitted in concentration, staring at the Nut through the window glass. Inthe silence that follows Lyme’s ultimatum, he speaks up. “Is it really sonecessary that we take the Nut? Or would it be enough to disable it?”“That would be a step in the right direction,” says Beetee. “What do you have inmind?”“Think of it as a wild dog den,” Gale continues. “You’re not going to fight yourway in. So you have two choices. Trap the dogs inside or flush them out.”“We’ve tried bombing the entrances,” says Lyme. “They’re set too far inside thestone for any real damage to be done.”“I wasn’t thinking of that,” says Gale. “I was thinking of using the mountain.”Beetee rises and joins Gale at the window, peering through his ill-fittingglasses. “See? Running down the sides?”“Avalanche paths,” says Beetee under his breath. “It’d be tricky. We’d have todesign the detonation sequence with great care, and once it’s in motion, wecouldn’t hope to control it.”“We don’t need to control it if we give up the idea that we have to possess theNut,” says Gale. “Only shut it down.”“So you’re suggesting we start avalanches and block the entrances?” asks Lyme.“That’s it,” says Gale. “Trap the enemy inside, cut off from supplies. Make itimpossible for them to send out their hovercraft.”While everyone considers the plan, Boggs flips through a stack of blueprints ofthe Nut and frowns. “You risk killing everyone inside. Look at the ventilationsystem. It’s rudimentary at best. Nothing like what we have in Thirteen. Itdepends entirely on pumping in air from the mountainsides. Block those vents andyou’ll suffocate whoever is trapped.”“They could still escape through the train tunnel to the square,” says Beetee.“Not if we blow it up,” says Gale brusquely. His intent, his full intent,becomes clear. Gale has no interest in preserving the lives of those in the Nut.No interest in caging the prey for later use.This is one of his death traps."},{"pageContent":"15 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_15]The implications of what Gale is suggesting settle quietly around the room. Youcan see the reaction playing out on people’s faces. The expressions range frompleasure to distress, from sorrow to satisfaction.“The majority of the workers are citizens from Two,” says Beetee neutrally.“So what?” says Gale. “We’ll never be able to trust them again.”“They should at least have a chance to surrender,” says Lyme.“Well, that’s a luxury we weren’t given when they fire-bombed Twelve, but you’reall so much cozier with the Capitol here,” says Gale. By the look on Lyme’sface, I think she might shoot him, or at least take a swing. She’d probably havethe upper hand, too, with all her training. But her anger only seems toinfuriate him and he yells, “We watched children burn to death and there wasnothing we could do!”I have to close my eyes a minute, as the image rips through me. It has thedesired effect. I want everyone in that mountain dead. Am about to say so. Butthen…I’m also a girl from District 12. Not President Snow. I can’t help it. Ican’t condemn someone to the death he’s suggesting. “Gale,” I say, taking hisarm and trying to speak in a reasonable tone. “The Nut’s an old mine. It’d belike causing a massive coal mining accident.” Surely the words are enough tomake anyone from 12 think twice about the plan.“But not so quick as the one that killed our fathers,” he retorts. “Is thateveryone’s problem? That our enemies might have a few hours to reflect on thefact that they’re dying, instead of just being blown to bits?”Back in the old days, when we were nothing more than a couple of kids huntingoutside of 12, Gale said things like this and worse. But then they were justwords. Here, put into practice, they become deeds that can never be reversed.“You don’t know how those District Two people ended up in the Nut,” I say. “Theymay have been coerced. They may be held against their will. Some are our ownspies. Will you kill them, too?”“I would sacrifice a few, yes, to take out the rest of them,” he replies. “Andif I were a spy in there, I’d say, ‘Bring on the avalanches!’”I know he’s telling the truth. That Gale would sacrifice his life in this wayfor the cause—no one doubts it. Perhaps we’d all do the same if we were thespies and given the choice. I guess I would. But it’s a coldhearted decision tomake for other people and those who love them.“You said we had two choices,” Boggs tells him. “To trap them or to flush themout. I say we try to avalanche the mountain but leave the train tunnel alone.People can escape into the square, where we’ll be waiting for them.”“Heavily armed, I hope,” says Gale. “You can be sure they’ll be.”“Heavily armed. We’ll take them prisoner,” agrees Boggs.“Let’s bring Thirteen into the loop now,” Beetee suggests. “Let President Coinweigh in.”“She’ll want to block the tunnel,” says Gale with conviction.“Yes, most likely. But you know, Peeta did have a point in his propos. About thedangers of killing ourselves off. I’ve been playing with some numbers. Factoringin the casualties and the wounded and…I think it’s at least worth aconversation,” says Beetee.Only a handful of people are invited to be part of that conversation. Gale and Iare released with the rest. I take him hunting so he can blow off some steam,but he’s not talking about it. Probably too angry with me for countering him.The call does happen, a decision is made, and by evening I’m suited up in myMockingjay outfit, with my bow slung over my shoulder and an earpiece thatconnects me to Haymitch in 13—just in case a good opportunity for a propoarises. We wait on the roof of the Justice Building with a clear view of ourtarget.Our hoverplanes are initially ignored by the commanders in the Nut, because inthe past they’ve been little more trouble than flies buzzing around a honeypot.But after two rounds of bombings in the higher elevations of the mountain, theplanes have their attention. By the time the Capitol’s antiaircraft weaponsbegin to fire, it’s already too late.Gale’s plan exceeds anyone’s expectations. Beetee was right about being unableto control the avalanches once they’d been set in motion. The mountainsides arenaturally unstable, but weakened by the explosions, they seem almost fluid.Whole sections of the Nut collapse before our eyes, obliterating any sign thathuman beings have ever set foot on the place. We stand speechless, tiny andinsignificant, as waves of stone thunder down the mountain. Burying theentrances under tons of rock. Raising a cloud of dirt and debris that blackensthe sky. Turning the Nut into a tomb.I imagine the hell inside the mountain. Sirens wailing. Lights flickering intodarkness. Stone dust choking the air. The shrieks of panicked, trapped beingsstumbling madly for a way out, only to find the entrances, the launchpad, theventilation shafts themselves clogged with earth and rock trying to force itsway in. Live wires flung free, fires breaking out, rubble making a familiar patha maze. People slamming, shoving, scrambling like ants as the hill presses in,threatening to crush their fragile shells.“Katniss?” Haymitch’s voice is in my earpiece. I try to answer back and findboth of my hands are clamped tightly over my mouth. “Katniss!”On the day my father died, the sirens went off during my school lunch. No onewaited for dismissal, or was expected to. The response to a mine accident wassomething outside the control of even the Capitol. I ran to Prim’s class. Istill remember her, tiny at seven, very pale, but sitting straight up with herhands folded on her desk. Waiting for me to collect her as I’d promised I wouldif the sirens ever sounded. She sprang out of her seat, grabbed my coat sleeve,and we wove through the streams of people pouring out onto the streets to poolat the main entrance of the mine. We found our mother clenching the rope thathad been hastily strung to keep the crowd back. In retrospect, I guess I shouldhave known there was a problem right then. Because why were we looking for her,when the reverse should have been true?The elevators were screeching, burning up and down their cables as they vomitedsmoke-blackened miners into the light of day. With each group came cries ofrelief, relatives diving under the rope to lead off their husbands, wives,children, parents, siblings. We stood in the freezing air as the afternoonturned overcast, a light snow dusted the earth. The elevators moved more slowlynow and disgorged fewer beings. I knelt on the ground and pressed my hands intothe cinders, wanting so badly to pull my father free. If there’s a more helplessfeeling than trying to reach someone you love who’s trapped underground, I don’tknow it. The wounded. The bodies. The waiting through the night. Blankets putaround your shoulders by strangers. A mug of something hot that you don’t drink.And then finally, at dawn, the grieved expression on the face of the minecaptain that could only mean one thing.What did we just do?“Katniss! Are you there?” Haymitch is probably making plans to have me fittedfor a head shackle at this very moment.I drop my hands. “Yes.”“Get inside. Just in case the Capitol tries to retaliate with what’s left of itsair force,” he instructs.“Yes,” I repeat. Everyone on the roof, except for the soldiers manning themachine guns, begin to make their way inside. As I descend the stairs, I can’thelp brushing my fingers along the unblemished white marble walls. So cold andbeautiful. Even in the Capitol, there’s nothing to match the magnificence ofthis old building. But there is no give to the surface—only my flesh yields, mywarmth taken. Stone conquers people every time.I sit at the base of one of the gigantic pillars in the great entrance hall.Through the doors I can see the white expanse of marble that leads to the stepson the square. I remember how sick I was the day Peeta and I acceptedcongratulations there for winning the Games. Worn down by the Victory Tour,failing in my attempt to calm the districts, facing the memories of Clove andCato, particularly Cato’s gruesome, slow death by mutts.Boggs crouches down beside me, his skin pale in the shadows. “We didn’t bomb thetrain tunnel, you know. Some of them will probably get out.”“And then we’ll shoot them when they show their faces?” I ask.“Only if we have to,” he answers.“We could send in trains ourselves. Help evacuate the wounded,” I say.“No. It was decided to leave the tunnel in their hands. That way they can useall the tracks to bring people out,” says Boggs. “Besides, it will give us timeto get the rest of our soldiers to the square.”A few hours ago, the square was a no-man’s-land, the front line of the fightbetween the rebels and the Peacekeepers. When Coin gave approval for Gale’splan, the rebels launched a heated attack and drove the Capitol forces backseveral blocks so that we would control the train station in the event that theNut fell. Well, it’s fallen. The reality has sunk in. Any survivors will escapeto the square. I can hear the gunfire starting again, as the Peacekeepers are nodoubt trying to fight their way in to rescue their comrades. Our own soldiersare being brought in to counter this.“You’re cold,” says Boggs. “I’ll see if I can find a blanket.” He goes before Ican protest. I don’t want a blanket, even if the marble continues to leech mybody heat.“Katniss,” says Haymitch in my ear.“Still here,” I answer.“Interesting turn of events with Peeta this afternoon. Thought you’d want toknow,” he says. Interesting isn’t good. It isn’t better. But I don’t really haveany choice but to listen. “We showed him that clip of you singing ‘The HangingTree.’ It was never aired, so the Capitol couldn’t use it when he was beinghijacked. He says he recognized the song.”For a moment, my heart skips a beat. Then I realize it’s just more trackerjacker serum confusion. “He couldn’t, Haymitch. He never heard me sing thatsong.”“Not you. Your father. He heard him singing it one day when he came to trade atthe bakery. Peeta was small, probably six or seven, but he remembered it becausehe was specially listening to see if the birds stopped singing,” says Haymitch.“Guess they did.”Six or seven. That would have been before my mother banned the song. Maybe evenright around the time I was learning it. “Was I there, too?”“Don’t think so. No mention of you anyway. But it’s the first connection to youthat hasn’t triggered some mental meltdown,” says Haymitch. “It’s something, atleast, Katniss.”My father. He seems to be everywhere today. Dying in the mine. Singing his wayinto Peeta’s muddled consciousness. Flickering in the look Boggs gives me as heprotectively wraps the blanket around my shoulders. I miss him so badly ithurts.The gunfire’s really picking up outside. Gale hurries by with a group of rebels,eagerly headed for the battle. I don’t petition to join the fighters, not thatthey would let me. I have no stomach for it anyway, no heat in my blood. I wishPeeta was here—the old Peeta—because he would be able to articulate why it is sowrong to be exchanging fire when people, any people, are trying to claw theirway out of the mountain. Or is my own history making me too sensitive? Aren’t weat war? Isn’t this just another way to kill our enemies?Night falls quickly. Huge, bright spotlights are turned on, illuminating thesquare. Every bulb must be burning at full wattage inside the train station aswell. Even from my position across the square, I can see clearly through theplate-glass front of the long, narrow building. It would be impossible to missthe arrival of a train, or even a single person. But hours pass and no onecomes. With each minute, it becomes harder to imagine that anyone survived theassault on the Nut.It’s well after midnight when Cressida comes to attach a special microphone tomy costume. “What’s this for?” I ask.Haymitch’s voice comes on to explain. “I know you’re not going to like this, butwe need you to make a speech.”“A speech?” I say, immediately feeling queasy.“I’ll feed it to you, line by line,” he assures me. “You’ll just have to repeatwhat I say. Look, there’s no sign of life from that mountain. We’ve won, but thefighting’s continuing. So we thought if you went out on the steps of the JusticeBuilding and laid it out—told everybody that the Nut’s defeated, that theCapitol’s presence in District Two is finished—you might be able to get the restof their forces to surrender.”I peer at the darkness beyond the square. “I can’t even see their forces.”“That’s what the mike’s for,” he says. “You’ll be broadcast, both your voicethrough their emergency audio system, and your image wherever people have accessto a screen.”I know there are a couple of huge screens here on the square. I saw them on theVictory Tour. It might work, if I were good at this sort of thing. Which I’mnot. They tried to feed me lines in those early experiments with the propos,too, and it was a flop.“You could save a lot of lives, Katniss,” Haymitch says finally.“All right. I’ll give it a try,” I tell him.It’s strange standing outside at the top of the stairs, fully costumed, brightlylit, but with no visible audience to deliver my speech to. Like I’m doing a showfor the moon.“Let’s make this quick,” says Haymitch. “You’re too exposed.”My television crew, positioned out in the square with special cameras, indicatesthat they’re ready. I tell Haymitch to go ahead, then click on my mike andlisten carefully to him dictate the first line of the speech. A huge image of melights up one of the screens over the square as I begin. “People of DistrictTwo, this is Katniss Everdeen speaking to you from the steps of your JusticeBuilding, where—”The pair of trains comes screeching into the train station side by side. As thedoors slide open, people tumble out in a cloud of smoke they’ve brought from theNut. They must have had at least an inkling of what would await them at thesquare, because you can see them trying to act evasively. Most of them flattenon the floor, and a spray of bullets inside the station takes out the lights.They’ve come armed, as Gale predicted, but they’ve come wounded as well. Themoans can be heard in the otherwise silent night air.Someone kills the lights on the stairs, leaving me in the protection of shadow.A flame blooms inside the station—one of the trains must actually be on fire—anda thick, black smoke billows against the windows. Left with no choice, thepeople begin to push out into the square, choking but defiantly waving theirguns. My eyes dart around the rooftops that ring the square. Every one of themhas been fortified with rebel-manned machine gun nests. Moonlight glints offoiled barrels.A young man staggers out from the station, one hand pressed against a bloodycloth at his cheek, the other dragging a gun. When he trips and falls to hisface, I see the scorch marks down the back of his shirt, the red flesh beneath.And suddenly, he’s just another burn victim from a mine accident.My feet fly down the steps and I take off running for him. “Stop!” I yell at therebels. “Hold your fire!” The words echo around the square and beyond as themike amplifies my voice. “Stop!” I’m nearing the young man, reaching down tohelp him, when he drags himself up to his knees and trains his gun on my head.I instinctively back up a few steps, raise my bow over my head to show myintention was harmless. Now that he has both hands on his gun, I notice theragged hole in his cheek where something—falling stone maybe—punctured theflesh. He smells of burning things, hair and meat and fuel. His eyes are crazedwith pain and fear.“Freeze,” Haymitch’s voice whispers in my ear. I follow his order, realizingthat this is what all of District 2, all of Panem maybe, must be seeing at themoment. The Mockingjay at the mercy of a man with nothing to lose.His garbled speech is barely comprehensible. “Give me one reason I shouldn’tshoot you.”The rest of the world recedes. There’s only me looking into the wretched eyes ofthe man from the Nut who asks for one reason. Surely I should be able to come upwith thousands. But the words that make it to my lips are “I can’t.”Logically, the next thing that should happen is the man pulling the trigger. Buthe’s perplexed, trying to make sense of my words. I experience my own confusionas I realize what I’ve said is entirely true, and the noble impulse that carriedme across the square is replaced by despair. “I can’t. That’s the problem, isn’tit?” I lower my bow. “We blew up your mine. You burned my district to theground. We’ve got every reason to kill each other. So do it. Make the Capitolhappy. I’m done killing their slaves for them.” I drop my bow on the ground andgive it a nudge with my boot. It slides across the stone and comes to rest athis knees.“I’m not their slave,” the man mutters.“I am,” I say. “That’s why I killed Cato…and he killed Thresh…and he killedClove…and she tried to kill me. It just goes around and around, and who wins?Not us. Not the districts. Always the Capitol. But I’m tired of being a piece intheir Games.”Peeta. On the rooftop the night before our first Hunger Games. He understood itall before we’d even set foot in the arena. I hope he’s watching now, that heremembers that night as it happened, and maybe forgives me when I die.“Keep talking. Tell them about watching the mountain go down,” Haymitch insists.“When I saw that mountain fall tonight, I thought…they’ve done it again. Got meto kill you—the people in the districts. But why did I do it? District Twelveand District Two have no fight except the one the Capitol gave us.” The youngman blinks at me uncomprehendingly. I sink on my knees before him, my voice lowand urgent. “And why are you fighting with the rebels on the rooftops? WithLyme, who was your victor? With people who were your neighbors, maybe even yourfamily?”“I don’t know,” says the man. But he doesn’t take his gun off me.I rise and turn slowly in a circle, addressing the machine guns. “And you upthere? I come from a mining town. Since when do miners condemn other miners tothat kind of death, and then stand by to kill whoever manages to crawl from therubble?”“Who is the enemy?” whispers Haymitch.“These people”—I indicate the wounded bodies on the square—“are not your enemy!”I whip back around to the train station. “The rebels are not your enemy! We allhave one enemy, and it’s the Capitol! This is our chance to put an end to theirpower, but we need every district person to do it!”The cameras are tight on me as I reach out my hands to the man, to the wounded,to the reluctant rebels across Panem. “Please! Join us!”My words hang in the air. I look to the screen, hoping to see them recordingsome wave of reconciliation going through the crowd.Instead I watch myself get shot on television."},{"pageContent":"16 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_16]“Always.”In the twilight of morphling, Peeta whispers the word and I go searching forhim. It’s a gauzy, violet-tinted world, with no hard edges, and many places tohide. I push through cloud banks, follow faint tracks, catch the scent ofcinnamon, of dill. Once I feel his hand on my cheek and try to trap it, but itdissolves like mist through my fingers.When I finally begin to surface into the sterile hospital room in 13, Iremember. I was under the influence of sleep syrup. My heel had been injuredafter I’d climbed out on a branch over the electric fence and dropped back into12. Peeta had put me to bed and I had asked him to stay with me as I wasdrifting off. He had whispered something I couldn’t quite catch. But some partof my brain had trapped his single word of reply and let it swim up through mydreams to taunt me now. “Always.”Morphling dulls the extremes of all emotions, so instead of a stab of sorrow, Imerely feel emptiness. A hollow of dead brush where flowers used to bloom.Unfortunately, there’s not enough of the drug left in my veins for me to ignorethe pain in the left side of my body. That’s where the bullet hit. My handsfumble over the thick bandages encasing my ribs and I wonder what I’m stilldoing here.It wasn’t him, the man kneeling before me on the square, the burned one from theNut. He didn’t pull the trigger. It was someone farther back in the crowd. Therewas less a sense of penetration than the feeling that I’d been struck with asledgehammer. Everything after the moment of impact is confusion riddled withgunfire. I try to sit up, but the only thing I manage is a moan.The white curtain that divides my bed from the next patient’s whips back, andJohanna Mason stares down at me. At first I feel threatened, because sheattacked me in the arena. I have to remind myself that she did it to save mylife. It was part of the rebel plot. But still, that doesn’t mean she doesn’tdespise me. Maybe her treatment of me was all an act for the Capitol?“I’m alive,” I say rustily.“No kidding, brainless.” Johanna walks over and plunks down on my bed, sendingspikes of pain shooting across my chest. When she grins at my discomfort, I knowwe’re not in for some warm reunion scene. “Still a little sore?” With an experthand, she quickly detaches the morphling drip from my arm and plugs it into asocket taped into the crook of her own. “They started cutting back my supply afew days ago. Afraid I’m going to turn into one of those freaks from Six. I’vehad to borrow from you when the coast was clear. Didn’t think you’d mind.”Mind? How can I mind when she was almost tortured to death by Snow after theQuarter Quell? I have no right to mind, and she knows it.Johanna sighs as the morphling enters her bloodstream. “Maybe they were ontosomething in Six. Drug yourself out and paint flowers on your body. Not such abad life. Seemed happier than the rest of us, anyway.”In the weeks since I left 13, she’s gained some weight back. A soft down of hairhas sprouted on her shaved head, helping to hide some of the scars. But if she’ssiphoning off my morphling, she’s struggling.“They’ve got this head doctor who comes around every day. Supposed to be helpingme recover. Like some guy who’s spent his life in this rabbit warren’s going tofix me up. Complete idiot. At least twenty times a session he reminds me thatI’m totally safe.” I manage a smile. It’s a truly stupid thing to say,especially to a victor. As if such a state of being ever existed, anywhere, foranyone. “How about you, Mockingjay? You feel totally safe?”“Oh, yeah. Right up until I got shot,” I say.“Please. That bullet never even touched you. Cinna saw to that,” she says.I think of the layers of protective armor in my Mockingjay outfit. But the paincame from somewhere. “Broken ribs?”“Not even. Bruised pretty good. The impact ruptured your spleen. They couldn’trepair it.” She gives a dismissive wave of her hand. “Don’t worry, you don’tneed one. And if you did, they’d find you one, wouldn’t they? It’s everybody’sjob to keep you alive.”“Is that why you hate me?” I ask.“Partly,” she admits. “Jealousy is certainly involved. I also think you’re alittle hard to swallow. With your tacky romantic drama and yourdefender-of-the-helpless act. Only it isn’t an act, which makes you moreunbearable. Please feel free to take this personally.”“You should have been the Mockingjay. No one would’ve had to feed you lines,” Isay.“True. But no one likes me,” she tells me.“They trusted you, though. To get me out,” I remind her. “And they’re afraid ofyou.”“Here, maybe. In the Capitol, you’re the one they’re scared of now.” Galeappears in the doorway, and Johanna neatly unhooks herself and reattaches me tothe morphling drip. “Your cousin’s not afraid of me,” she says confidentially.She scoots off my bed and crosses to the door, nudging Gale’s leg with her hipas she passes him. “Are you, gorgeous?” We can hear her laughter as shedisappears down the hall.I raise my eyebrows at him as he takes my hand. “Terrified,” he mouths. I laugh,but it turns into a wince. “Easy.” He strokes my face as the pain ebbs. “You’vegot to stop running straight into trouble.”“I know. But someone blew up a mountain,” I answer.Instead of pulling back, he leans in closer, searching my face. “You think I’mheartless.”“I know you’re not. But I won’t tell you it’s okay,” I say.Now he draws back, almost impatiently. “Katniss, what difference is there,really, between crushing our enemy in a mine or blowing them out of the sky withone of Beetee’s arrows? The result is the same.”“I don’t know. We were under attack in Eight, for one thing. The hospital wasunder attack,” I say.“Yes, and those hoverplanes came from District Two,” he says. “So, by takingthem out, we prevented further attacks.”“But that kind of thinking…you could turn it into an argument for killing anyoneat any time. You could justify sending kids into the Hunger Games to prevent thedistricts from getting out of line,” I say.“I don’t buy that,” he tells me.“I do,” I reply. “It must be those trips to the arena.”“Fine. We know how to disagree,” he says. “We always have. Maybe it’s good.Between you and me, we’ve got District Two now.”“Really?” For a moment a feeling of triumph flares up inside me. Then I thinkabout the people on the square. “Was there fighting after I was shot?”“Not much. The workers from the Nut turned on the Capitol soldiers. The rebelsjust sat by and watched,” he says. “Actually, the whole country just sat by andwatched.”“Well, that’s what they do best,” I say.You’d think that losing a major organ would entitle you to lie around a fewweeks, but for some reason, my doctors want me up and moving almost immediately.Even with the morphling, the internal pain’s severe the first few days, but thenit slacks off considerably. The soreness from the bruised ribs, however,promises to hang on for a while. I begin to resent Johanna dipping into mymorphling supply, but I still let her take whatever she likes.Rumors of my death have been running rampant, so they send in the team to filmme in my hospital bed. I show off my stitches and impressive bruising andcongratulate the districts on their successful battle for unity. Then I warn theCapitol to expect us soon.As part of my rehabilitation, I take short walks aboveground each day. Oneafternoon, Plutarch joins me and gives me an update on our current situation.Now that District 2 has allied with us, the rebels are taking a breather fromthe war to regroup. Fortifying supply lines, seeing to the wounded, reorganizingtheir troops. The Capitol, like 13 during the Dark Days, finds itself completelycut off from outside help as it holds the threat of nuclear attack over itsenemies. Unlike 13, the Capitol is not in a position to reinvent itself andbecome self-sufficient.“Oh, the city might be able to scrape along for a while,” says Plutarch.“Certainly, there are emergency supplies stockpiled. But the significantdifference between Thirteen and the Capitol are the expectations of thepopulace. Thirteen was used to hardship, whereas in the Capitol, all they’veknown is Panem et Circenses.”“What’s that?” I recognize Panem, of course, but the rest is nonsense.“It’s a saying from thousands of years ago, written in a language called Latinabout a place called Rome,” he explains. “Panem et Circenses translates into‘Bread and Circuses.’ The writer was saying that in return for full bellies andentertainment, his people had given up their political responsibilities andtherefore their power.”I think about the Capitol. The excess of food. And the ultimate entertainment.The Hunger Games. “So that’s what the districts are for. To provide the breadand circuses.”“Yes. And as long as that kept rolling in, the Capitol could control its littleempire. Right now, it can provide neither, at least at the standard the peopleare accustomed to,” says Plutarch. “We have the food and I’m about toorchestrate an entertainment propo that’s sure to be popular. After all,everybody loves a wedding.”I freeze in my tracks, sick at the idea of what he’s suggesting. Somehow stagingsome perverse wedding between Peeta and me. I haven’t been able to face thatone-way glass since I’ve been back and, at my own request, only get updatesabout Peeta’s condition from Haymitch. He speaks very little about it. Differenttechniques are being tried. There will never truly be a way to cure him. And nowthey want me to marry Peeta for a propo?Plutarch rushes to reassure me. “Oh, no, Katniss. Not your wedding. Finnick andAnnie’s. All you need to do is show up and pretend to be happy for them.”“That’s one of the few things I won’t have to pretend, Plutarch,” I tell him.The next few days bring a flurry of activity as the event is planned. Thedifferences between the Capitol and 13 are thrown into sharp relief by theevent. When Coin says “wedding,” she means two people signing a piece of paperand being assigned a new compartment. Plutarch means hundreds of people dressedin finery at a three-day celebration. It’s amusing to watch them haggle over thedetails. Plutarch has to fight for every guest, every musical note. After Coinvetoes a dinner, entertainment, and alcohol, Plutarch yells, “What’s the pointof the propo if no one’s having any fun!”It’s hard to put a Gamemaker on a budget. But even a quiet celebration causes astir in 13, where they seem to have no holidays at all. When it’s announced thatchildren are wanted to sing District 4’s wedding song, practically every kidshows up. There’s no shortage of volunteers to help make decorations. In thedining hall, people chat excitedly about the event.Maybe it’s more than the festivities. Maybe it’s that we are all so starved forsomething good to happen that we want to be part of it. It would explainwhy—when Plutarch has a fit over what the bride will wear—I volunteer to takeAnnie back to my house in 12, where Cinna left a variety of evening clothes in abig storage closet downstairs. All of the wedding gowns he designed for me wentback to the Capitol, but there are some dresses I wore on the Victory Tour. I’ma little leery about being with Annie since all I really know about her is thatFinnick loves her and everybody thinks she’s mad. On the hovercraft ride, Idecide she’s less mad than unstable. She laughs at odd places in theconversation or drops out of it distractedly. Those green eyes fixate on a pointwith such intensity that you find yourself trying to make out what she sees inthe empty air. Sometimes, for no reason, she presses both her hands over herears as if to block out a painful sound. All right, she’s strange, but ifFinnick loves her, that’s good enough for me.I got permission for my prep team to come along, so I’m relieved of having tomake any fashion decisions. When I open the closet, we all fall silent becauseCinna’s presence is so strong in the flow of the fabrics. Then Octavia drops toher knees, rubs the hem of a skirt against her cheek, and bursts into tears.“It’s been so long,” she gasps, “since I’ve seen anything pretty.”Despite reservations on Coin’s side that it’s too extravagant, and on Plutarch’sside that it’s too drab, the wedding is a smash hit. The three hundred luckyguests culled from 13 and the many refugees wear their everyday clothes, thedecorations are made from autumn foliage, the music is provided by a choir ofchildren accompanied by the lone fiddler who made it out of 12 with hisinstrument. So it’s simple, frugal by the Capitol’s standards. It doesn’t matterbecause nothing can compete with the beauty of the couple. It isn’t about theirborrowed finery—Annie wears a green silk dress I wore in 5, Finnick one ofPeeta’s suits that they altered—although the clothes are striking. Who can lookpast the radiant faces of two people for whom this day was once a virtualimpossibility? Dalton, the cattle guy from 10, conducts the ceremony, since it’ssimilar to the one used in his district. But there are unique touches ofDistrict 4. A net woven from long grass that covers the couple during theirvows, the touching of each other’s lips with salt water, and the ancient weddingsong, which likens marriage to a sea voyage.No, I don’t have to pretend to be happy for them.After the kiss that seals the union, the cheers, and a toast with apple cider,the fiddler strikes up a tune that turns every head from 12. We may have beenthe smallest, poorest district in Panem, but we know how to dance. Nothing hasbeen officially scheduled at this point, but Plutarch, who’s calling the propofrom the control room, must have his fingers crossed. Sure enough, Greasy Saegrabs Gale by the hand and pulls him into the center of the floor and faces offwith him. People pour in to join them, forming two long lines. And the dancingbegins.I’m standing off to the side, clapping to the rhythm, when a bony hand pinchesme above the elbow. Johanna scowls at me. “Are you going to miss the chance tolet Snow see you dancing?” She’s right. What could spell victory louder than ahappy Mockingjay twirling around to music? I find Prim in the crowd. Sincewinter evenings gave us a lot of time to practice, we’re actually pretty goodpartners. I brush off her concerns about my ribs, and we take our places in theline. It hurts, but the satisfaction of having Snow watch me dance with mylittle sister reduces other feelings to dust.Dancing transforms us. We teach the steps to the District 13 guests. Insist on aspecial number for the bride and groom. Join hands and make a giant, spinningcircle where people show off their footwork. Nothing silly, joyful, or fun hashappened in so long. This could go on all night if not for the last eventplanned in Plutarch’s propo. One I hadn’t heard about, but then it was meant tobe a surprise.Four people wheel out a huge wedding cake from a side room. Most of the guestsback up, making way for this rarity, this dazzling creation with blue-green,white-tipped icing waves swimming with fish and sailboats, seals and seaflowers. But I push my way through the crowd to confirm what I knew at firstsight. As surely as the embroidery stitches in Annie’s gown were done by Cinna’shand, the frosted flowers on the cake were done by Peeta’s.This may seem like a small thing, but it speaks volumes. Haymitch has beenkeeping a great deal from me. The boy I last saw, screaming his head off, tryingto tear free of his restraints, could never have made this. Never have had thefocus, kept his hands steady, designed something so perfect for Finnick andAnnie. As if anticipating my reaction, Haymitch is at my side.“Let’s you and me have a talk,” he says.Out in the hall, away from the cameras, I ask, “What’s happening to him?”Haymitch shakes his head. “I don’t know. None of us knows. Sometimes he’s almostrational, and then, for no reason, he goes off again. Doing the cake was a kindof therapy. He’s been working on it for days. Watching him…he seemed almost likebefore.”“So, he’s got the run of the place?” I ask. The idea makes me nervous on aboutfive different levels.“Oh, no. He frosted under heavy guard. He’s still under lock and key. But I’vetalked to him,” Haymitch says.“Face-to-face?” I ask. “And he didn’t go nuts?”“No. Pretty angry with me, but for all the right reasons. Not telling him aboutthe rebel plot and whatnot.” Haymitch pauses a moment, as if deciding something.“He says he’d like to see you.”I’m on a frosting sailboat, tossed around by blue-green waves, the deck shiftingbeneath my feet. My palms press into the wall to steady myself. This wasn’t partof the plan. I wrote Peeta off in 2. Then I was to go to the Capitol, kill Snow,and get taken out myself. The gunshot was only a temporary setback. Never was Isupposed to hear the words He says he’d like to see you. But now that I have,there’s no way to refuse.At midnight, I’m standing outside the door to his cell. Hospital room. We had towait for Plutarch to finish getting his wedding footage, which, despite the lackof what he calls razzle-dazzle, he’s pleased with. “The best thing about theCapitol basically ignoring Twelve all these years is that you people still havea little spontaneity. The audience eats that up. Like when Peeta announced hewas in love with you or you did the trick with the berries. Makes for goodtelevision.”I wish I could meet with Peeta privately. But the audience of doctors hasassembled behind the one-way glass, clipboards ready, pens poised. When Haymitchgives me the okay in my earpiece, I slowly open the door.Those blue eyes lock on me instantly. He’s got three restraints on each arm, anda tube that can dispense a knockout drug just in case he loses control. Hedoesn’t fight to free himself, though, only observes me with the wary look ofsomeone who still hasn’t ruled out that he’s in the presence of a mutt. I walkover until I’m standing about a yard from the bed. There’s nothing to do with myhands, so I cross my arms protectively over my ribs before I speak. “Hey.”“Hey,” he responds. It’s like his voice, almost his voice, except there’ssomething new in it. An edge of suspicion and reproach.“Haymitch said you wanted to talk to me,” I say.“Look at you, for starters.” It’s like he’s waiting for me to transform into ahybrid drooling wolf right before his eyes. He stares so long I find myselfcasting furtive glances at the one-way glass, hoping for some direction fromHaymitch, but my earpiece stays silent. “You’re not very big, are you? Orparticularly pretty?”I know he’s been through hell and back, and yet somehow the observation rubs methe wrong way. “Well, you’ve looked better.”Haymitch’s advice to back off gets muffled by Peeta’s laughter. “And not evenremotely nice. To say that to me after all I’ve been through.”“Yeah. We’ve all been through a lot. And you’re the one who was known for beingnice. Not me.” I’m doing everything wrong. I don’t know why I feel so defensive.He’s been tortured! He’s been hijacked! What’s wrong with me? Suddenly, I thinkI might start screaming at him—I’m not even sure about what—so I decide to getout of there. “Look, I don’t feel so well. Maybe I’ll drop by tomorrow.”I’ve just reached the door when his voice stops me. “Katniss. I remember aboutthe bread.”The bread. Our one moment of real connection before the Hunger Games.“They showed you the tape of me talking about it,” I say.“No. Is there a tape of you talking about it? Why didn’t the Capitol use itagainst me?” he asks.“I made it the day you were rescued,” I answer. The pain in my chest wrapsaround my ribs like a vise. The dancing was a mistake. “So what do youremember?”“You. In the rain,” he says softly. “Digging in our trash bins. Burning thebread. My mother hitting me. Taking the bread out for the pig but then giving itto you instead.”“That’s it. That’s what happened,” I say. “The next day, after school, I wantedto thank you. But I didn’t know how.”“We were outside at the end of the day. I tried to catch your eye. You lookedaway. And then…for some reason, I think you picked a dandelion.” I nod. He doesremember. I have never spoken about that moment aloud. “I must have loved you alot.”“You did.” My voice catches and I pretend to cough.“And did you love me?” he asks.I keep my eyes on the tiled floor. “Everyone says I did. Everyone says that’swhy Snow had you tortured. To break me.”“That’s not an answer,” he tells me. “I don’t know what to think when they showme some of the tapes. In that first arena, it looked like you tried to kill mewith those tracker jackers.”“I was trying to kill all of you,” I say. “You had me treed.”“Later, there’s a lot of kissing. Didn’t seem very genuine on your part. Did youlike kissing me?” he asks.“Sometimes,” I admit. “You know people are watching us now?”“I know. What about Gale?” he continues.My anger’s returning. I don’t care about his recovery—this isn’t the business ofthe people behind the glass. “He’s not a bad kisser either,” I say shortly.“And it was okay with both of us? You kissing the other?” he asks.“No. It wasn’t okay with either of you. But I wasn’t asking your permission,” Itell him.Peeta laughs again, coldly, dismissively. “Well, you’re a piece of work, aren’tyou?”Haymitch doesn’t protest when I walk out. Down the hall. Through the beehive ofcompartments. Find a warm pipe to hide behind in a laundry room. It takes a longtime before I get to the bottom of why I’m so upset. When I do, it’s almost toomortifying to admit. All those months of taking it for granted that Peetathought I was wonderful are over. Finally, he can see me for who I really am.Violent. Distrustful. Manipulative. Deadly.And I hate him for it."},{"pageContent":"17 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_17]Blindsided. That’s how I feel when Haymitch tells me in the hospital. I fly downthe steps to Command, mind racing a mile a minute, and burst right into a warmeeting.“What do you mean, I’m not going to the Capitol? I have to go! I’m theMockingjay!” I say.Coin barely looks up from her screen. “And as the Mockingjay, your primary goalof unifying the districts against the Capitol has been achieved. Don’t worry—ifit goes well, we’ll fly you in for the surrender.”The surrender?“That’ll be too late! I’ll miss all the fighting. You need me—I’m the best shotyou’ve got!” I shout. I don’t usually brag about this, but it’s got to be atleast close to true. “Gale’s going.”“Gale has shown up for training every day unless occupied with other approvedduties. We feel confident he can manage himself in the field,” says Coin. “Howmany training sessions do you estimate you’ve attended?”None. That’s how many. “Well, sometimes I was hunting. And…I trained with Beeteedown in Special Weaponry.”“It’s not the same, Katniss,” says Boggs. “We all know you’re smart and braveand a good shot. But we need soldiers in the field. You don’t know the firstthing about executing orders, and you’re not exactly at your physical peak.”“That didn’t bother you when I was in Eight. Or Two, for that matter,” Icounter.“You weren’t originally authorized for combat in either case,” says Plutarch,shooting me a look that signals I’m about to reveal too much.No, the bomber battle in 8 and my intervention in 2 were spontaneous, rash, anddefinitely unauthorized.“And both resulted in your injury,” Boggs reminds me. Suddenly, I see myselfthrough his eyes. A smallish seventeen-year-old girl who can’t quite catch herbreath since her ribs haven’t fully healed. Disheveled. Undisciplined.Recuperating. Not a soldier, but someone who needs to be looked after.“But I have to go,” I say.“Why?” asks Coin.I can’t very well say it’s so I can carry out my own personal vendetta againstSnow. Or that the idea of remaining here in 13 with the latest version of Peetawhile Gale goes off to fight is unbearable. But I have no shortage of reasons towant to fight in the Capitol. “Because of Twelve. Because they destroyed mydistrict.”The president thinks about this a moment. Considers me. “Well, you have threeweeks. It’s not long, but you can begin training. If the Assignment Board deemsyou fit, possibly your case will be reviewed.”That’s it. That’s the most I can hope for. I guess it’s my own fault. I did blowoff my schedule every single day unless something suited me. It didn’t seem likemuch of a priority, jogging around a field with a gun with so many other thingsgoing on. And now I’m paying for my negligence.Back in the hospital, I find Johanna in the same circumstance and spitting mad.I tell her about what Coin said. “Maybe you can train, too.”“Fine. I’ll train. But I’m going to the stinking Capitol if I have to kill acrew and fly there myself,” says Johanna.“Probably best not to bring that up in training,” I say. “But it’s nice to knowI’ll have a ride.”Johanna grins, and I feel a slight but significant shift in our relationship. Idon’t know that we’re actually friends, but possibly the word allies would beaccurate. That’s good. I’m going to need an ally.The next morning, when we report for training at 7:30, reality slaps me in theface. We’ve been funneled into a class of relative beginners, fourteen- orfifteen-year-olds, which seems a little insulting until it’s obvious thatthey’re in far better condition than we are. Gale and the other people alreadychosen to go to the Capitol are in a different, accelerated phase of training.After we stretch—which hurts—there’s a couple of hours of strengtheningexercises—which hurt—and a five-mile run—which kills. Even with Johanna’smotivational insults driving me on, I have to drop out after a mile.“It’s my ribs,” I explain to the trainer, a no-nonsense middle-aged woman we’resupposed to address as Soldier York. “They’re still bruised.”“Well, I’ll tell you, Soldier Everdeen, those are going to take at least anothermonth to heal up on their own,” she says.I shake my head. “I don’t have a month.”She looks me up and down. “The doctors haven’t offered you any treatment?”“Is there a treatment?” I ask. “They said they had to mend naturally.”“That’s what they say. But they could speed up the process if I recommend it. Iwarn you, though, it isn’t any fun,” she tells me.“Please. I’ve got to get to the Capitol,” I say.Soldier York doesn’t question this. She scribbles something on a pad and sendsme directly back to the hospital. I hesitate. I don’t want to miss any moretraining. “I’ll be back for the afternoon session,” I promise. She just pursesher lips.Twenty-four needle jabs to my rib cage later, I’m flattened out on my hospitalbed, gritting my teeth to keep from begging them to bring back my morphlingdrip. It’s been by my bed so I can take a hit as needed. I haven’t used itlately, but I kept it for Johanna’s sake. Today they tested my blood to makesure it was clean of the painkiller, as the mixture of the two drugs—themorphling and whatever’s set my ribs on fire—has dangerous side effects. Theymade it clear I would have a difficult couple of days. But I told them to goahead.It’s a bad night in our room. Sleep’s out of the question. I think I canactually smell the ring of flesh around my chest burning, and Johanna’s fightingoff withdrawal symptoms. Early on, when I apologize about cutting off hermorphling supply, she waves it off, saying it had to happen anyway. But by threein the morning, I’m the target of every colorful bit of profanity District 7 hasto offer. At dawn, she drags me out of bed, determined to get to training.“I don’t think I can do it,” I confess.“You can do it. We both can. We’re victors, remember? We’re the ones who cansurvive anything they throw at us,” she snarls at me. She’s a sick greenishcolor, shaking like a leaf. I get dressed.We must be victors to make it through the morning. I think I’m going to loseJohanna when we realize it’s pouring outside. Her face turns ashen and she seemsto have ceased breathing.“It’s just water. It won’t kill us,” I say. She clenches her jaw and stomps outinto the mud. Rain drenches us as we work our bodies and then slog around therunning course. I bail after a mile again, and I have to resist the temptationto take off my shirt so the cold water can sizzle off my ribs. I force down myfield lunch of soggy fish and beet stew. Johanna gets halfway through her bowlbefore it comes back up. In the afternoon, we learn to assemble our guns. Imanage it, but Johanna can’t hold her hands steady enough to fit the partstogether. When York’s back is turned, I help her out. Even though the raincontinues, the afternoon’s an improvement because we’re on the shooting range.At last, something I’m good at. It takes some adjusting from a bow to a gun, butby the end of the day, I’ve got the best score in my class.We’re just inside the hospital doors when Johanna declares, “This has to stop.Us living in the hospital. Everyone views us as patients.”It’s not a problem for me. I can move into our family compartment, but Johanna’snever been assigned one. When she tries to get discharged from the hospital,they won’t agree to let her live alone, even if she comes in for daily talkswith the head doctor. I think they may have put two and two together about themorphling and this only adds to their view that she’s unstable. “She won’t bealone. I’m going to room with her,” I announce. There’s some dissent, butHaymitch takes our part, and by bedtime, we have a compartment across from Primand my mother, who agrees to keep an eye on us.After I take a shower, and Johanna sort of wipes herself down with a damp cloth,she makes a cursory inspection of the place. When she opens the drawer thatholds my few possessions, she shuts it quickly. “Sorry.”I think how there’s nothing in Johanna’s drawer but her government-issuedclothes. That she doesn’t have one thing in the world to call her own. “It’sokay. You can look at my stuff if you want.”Johanna unlatches my locket, studying the pictures of Gale, Prim, and my mother.She opens the silver parachute and pulls out the spile and slips it onto herpinkie. “Makes me thirsty just looking at it.” Then she finds the pearl Peetagave me. “Is this—?”“Yeah,” I say. “Made it through somehow.” I don’t want to talk about Peeta. Oneof the best things about training is, it keeps me from thinking of him.“Haymitch says he’s getting better,” she says.“Maybe. But he’s changed,” I say.“So have you. So have I. And Finnick and Haymitch and Beetee. Don’t get mestarted on Annie Cresta. The arena messed us all up pretty good, don’t youthink? Or do you still feel like the girl who volunteered for your sister?” sheasks me.“No,” I answer.“That’s the one thing I think my head doctor might be right about. There’s nogoing back. So we might as well get on with things.” She neatly returns mykeepsakes to the drawer and climbs into the bed across from me just as thelights go out. “You’re not afraid I’ll kill you tonight?”“Like I couldn’t take you,” I answer. Then we laugh, since both our bodies areso wrecked, it will be a miracle if we can get up the next day. But we do. Eachmorning, we do. And by the end of the week, my ribs feel almost like new, andJohanna can assemble her rifle without help.Soldier York gives the pair of us an approving nod as we knock off for the day.“Fine job, Soldiers.”When we move out of hearing, Johanna mutters, “I think winning the Games waseasier.” But the look on her face says she’s pleased.In fact, we’re almost in good spirits when we go to the dining hall, whereGale’s waiting to eat with me. Receiving a giant serving of beef stew doesn’thurt my mood either. “First shipments of food arrived this morning,” Greasy Saetells me. “That’s real beef, from District Ten. Not any of your wild dog.”“Don’t remember you turning it down,” Gale tosses back.We join a group that includes Delly, Annie, and Finnick. It’s something to seeFinnick’s transformation since his marriage. His earlier incarnations—thedecadent Capitol heartthrob I met before the Quell, the enigmatic ally in thearena, the broken young man who tried to help me hold it together—these havebeen replaced by someone who radiates life. Finnick’s real charms ofself-effacing humor and an easygoing nature are on display for the first time.He never lets go of Annie’s hand. Not when they walk, not when they eat. I doubthe ever plans to. She’s lost in some daze of happiness. There are still momentswhen you can tell something slips in her brain and another world blinds her tous. But a few words from Finnick call her back.Delly, who I’ve known since I was little but never gave much thought to, hasgrown in my estimation. She was told what Peeta said to me that night after thewedding, but she’s not a gossip. Haymitch says she’s the best defender I havewhen Peeta goes off on some kind of tear about me. Always taking my side,blaming his negative perceptions on the Capitol’s torture. She has moreinfluence on him than any of the others do, because he really does know her.Anyway, even if she’s sugarcoating my good points, I appreciate it. Frankly, Icould use a little sugarcoating.I’m starving and the stew is so delicious—beef, potatoes, turnips, and onions ina thick gravy—that I have to force myself to slow down. All around the dininghall, you can feel the rejuvenating effect that a good meal can bring on. Theway it can make people kinder, funnier, more optimistic, and remind them it’snot a mistake to go on living. It’s better than any medicine. So I try to makeit last and join in the conversation. Sop up the gravy on my bread and nibble onit as I listen to Finnick telling some ridiculous story about a sea turtleswimming off with his hat. Laugh before I realize he’s standing there. Directlyacross the table, behind the empty seat next to Johanna. Watching me. I chokemomentarily as the gravy bread sticks in my throat.“Peeta!” says Delly. “It’s so nice to see you out…and about.”Two large guards stand behind him. He holds his tray awkwardly, balanced on hisfingertips since his wrists are shackled with a short chain between them.“What’s with the fancy bracelets?” asks Johanna.“I’m not quite trustworthy yet,” says Peeta. “I can’t even sit here without yourpermission.” He indicates the guards with his head.“Sure he can sit here. We’re old friends,” says Johanna, patting the spacebeside her. The guards nod and Peeta takes a seat. “Peeta and I had adjoiningcells in the Capitol. We’re very familiar with each other’s screams.”Annie, who’s on Johanna’s other side, does that thing where she covers her earsand exits reality. Finnick shoots Johanna an angry look as his arm encirclesAnnie.“What? My head doctor says I’m not supposed to censor my thoughts. It’s part ofmy therapy,” replies Johanna.The life has gone out of our little party. Finnick murmurs things to Annie untilshe slowly removes her hands. Then there’s a long silence while people pretendto eat.“Annie,” says Delly brightly, “did you know it was Peeta who decorated yourwedding cake? Back home, his family ran the bakery and he did all the icing.”Annie cautiously looks across Johanna. “Thank you, Peeta. It was beautiful.”“My pleasure, Annie,” says Peeta, and I hear that old note of gentleness in hisvoice that I thought was gone forever. Not that it’s directed at me. But still.“If we’re going to fit in that walk, we better go,” Finnick tells her. Hearranges both of their trays so he can carry them in one hand while holdingtightly to her with the other. “Good seeing you, Peeta.”“You be nice to her, Finnick. Or I might try and take her away from you.” Itcould be a joke, if the tone wasn’t so cold. Everything it conveys is wrong. Theopen distrust of Finnick, the implication that Peeta has his eye on Annie, thatAnnie could desert Finnick, that I do not even exist.“Oh, Peeta,” says Finnick lightly. “Don’t make me sorry I restarted your heart.”He leads Annie away after giving me a concerned glance.When they’re gone, Delly says in a reproachful voice, “He did save your life,Peeta. More than once.”“For her.” He gives me a brief nod. “For the rebellion. Not for me. I don’t owehim anything.”I shouldn’t rise to the bait, but I do. “Maybe not. But Mags is dead and you’restill here. That should count for something.”“Yeah, a lot of things should count for something that don’t seem to, Katniss.I’ve got some memories I can’t make sense of, and I don’t think the Capitoltouched them. A lot of nights on the train, for instance,” he says.Again the implications. That more happened on the train than did. That what didhappen—those nights I only kept my sanity because his arms were around me—nolonger matters. Everything a lie, everything a way of misusing him.Peeta makes a little gesture with his spoon, connecting Gale and me. “So, areyou two officially a couple now, or are they still dragging out the star-crossedlover thing?”“Still dragging,” says Johanna.Spasms cause Peeta’s hands to tighten into fists, then splay out in a bizarrefashion. Is it all he can do to keep them from my neck? I can feel the tensionin Gale’s muscles next to me, fear an altercation. But Gale simply says, “Iwouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it myself.”“What’s that?” asks Peeta.“You,” Gale answers.“You’ll have to be a little more specific,” says Peeta. “What about me?”“That they’ve replaced you with the evil-mutt version of yourself,” saysJohanna.Gale finishes his milk. “You done?” he asks me. I rise and we cross to drop offour trays. At the door, an old man stops me because I’m still clutching the restof my gravy bread in my hand. Something in my expression, or maybe the fact thatI’ve made no attempt to conceal it, makes him go easy on me. He lets me stuffthe bread in my mouth and move on. Gale and I are almost to my compartment whenhe speaks again. “I didn’t expect that.”“I told you he hated me,” I say.“It’s the way he hates you. It’s so…familiar. I used to feel like that,” headmits. “When I’d watch you kissing him on the screen. Only I knew I wasn’tbeing entirely fair. He can’t see that.”We reach my door. “Maybe he just sees me as I really am. I have to get somesleep.”Gale catches my arm before I can disappear. “So that’s what you’re thinkingnow?” I shrug. “Katniss, as your oldest friend, believe me when I say he’s notseeing you as you really are.” He kisses my cheek and goes.I sit on my bed, trying to stuff information from my Military Tactics books intomy head while memories of my nights with Peeta on the train distract me. Afterabout twenty minutes, Johanna comes in and throws herself across the foot of mybed. “You missed the best part. Delly lost her temper at Peeta over how hetreated you. She got very squeaky. It was like someone stabbing a mouse with afork repeatedly. The whole dining hall was riveted.”“What’d Peeta do?” I ask.“He started arguing with himself like he was two people. The guards had to takehim away. On the good side, no one seemed to notice I finished his stew.”Johanna rubs her hand over her protruding belly. I look at the layer of grimeunder her fingernails. Wonder if the people in 7 ever bathe.We spend a couple of hours quizzing each other on military terms. I visit mymother and Prim for a while. When I’m back in my compartment, showered, staringinto the darkness, I finally ask, “Johanna, could you really hear himscreaming?”“That was part of it,” she says. “Like the jabberjays in the arena. Only it wasreal. And it didn’t stop after an hour. Tick, tock.”“Tick, tock,” I whisper back.Roses. Wolf mutts. Tributes. Frosted dolphins. Friends. Mockingjays. Stylists.Me.Everything screams in my dreams tonight."},{"pageContent":"18 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_18]I throw myself into training with a vengeance. Eat, live, and breathe theworkouts, drills, weapons practice, lectures on tactics. A handful of us aremoved into an additional class that gives me hope I may be a contender for theactual war. The soldiers simply call it the Block, but the tattoo on my armlists it as S.S.C., short for Simulated Street Combat. Deep in 13, they’ve builtan artificial Capitol city block. The instructor breaks us into squads of eightand we attempt to carry out missions—gaining a position, destroying a target,searching a home—as if we were really fighting our way through the Capitol. Thething’s rigged so that everything that can go wrong for you does. A false steptriggers a land mine, a sniper appears on a rooftop, your gun jams, a cryingchild leads you into an ambush, your squadron leader—who’s just a voice on theprogram—gets hit by a mortar and you have to figure out what to do withoutorders. Part of you knows it’s fake and that they’re not going to kill you. Ifyou set off a land mine, you hear the explosion and have to pretend to fall overdead. But in other ways, it feels pretty real in there—the enemy soldiersdressed in Peacekeepers’ uniforms, the confusion of a smoke bomb. They even gasus. Johanna and I are the only ones who get our masks on in time. The rest ofour squad gets knocked out for ten minutes. And the supposedly harmless gas Itook a few lungfuls of gives me a wicked headache for the rest of the day.Cressida and her crew tape Johanna and me on the firing range. I know Gale andFinnick are being filmed as well. It’s part of a new propos series to show therebels preparing for the Capitol invasion. On the whole, things are going prettywell.Then Peeta starts showing up for our morning workouts. The manacles are off, buthe’s still constantly accompanied by a pair of guards. After lunch, I see himacross the field, drilling with a group of beginners. I don’t know what they’rethinking. If a spat with Delly can reduce him to arguing with himself, he’s gotno business learning how to assemble a gun.When I confront Plutarch, he assures me that it’s all for the camera. They’vegot footage of Annie getting married and Johanna hitting targets, but all ofPanem is wondering about Peeta. They need to see he’s fighting for the rebels,not for Snow. And maybe if they could just get a couple of shots of the two ofus, not kissing necessarily, just looking happy to be back together—I walk away from the conversation right then. That is not going to happen.In my rare moments of downtime, I anxiously watch the preparations for theinvasions. See equipment and provisions readied, divisions assembled. You cantell when someone’s received orders because they’re given a very short haircut,the mark of a person going into battle. There is much talk of the openingoffensive, which will be to secure the train tunnels that feed up into theCapitol.Just a few days before the first troops are to move out, York unexpectedly tellsJohanna and me she’s recommended us for the exam, and we’re to reportimmediately. There are four parts: an obstacle course that assesses yourphysical condition, a written tactics exam, a test of weapons proficiency, and asimulated combat situation in the Block. I don’t even have time to get nervousfor the first three and do well, but there’s a backlog at the Block. Some kindof technical bug they’re working out. A group of us exchanges information. Thismuch seems true. You go through alone. There’s no predicting what situationyou’ll be thrown into. One boy says, under his breath, that he’s heard it’sdesigned to target each individual’s weaknesses.My weaknesses? That’s a door I don’t even want to open. But I find a quiet spotand try to assess what they might be. The length of the list depresses me. Lackof physical brute force. A bare minimum of training. And somehow my stand-outstatus as the Mockingjay doesn’t seem to be an advantage in a situation wherethey’re trying to get us to blend into a pack. They could nail me to the wall onany number of things.Johanna’s called three ahead of me, and I give her a nod of encouragement. Iwish I had been at the top of the list because now I’m really overthinking thewhole thing. By the time my name’s called, I don’t know what my strategy shouldbe. Fortunately, once I’m in the Block, a certain amount of training does kickin. It’s an ambush situation. Peacekeepers appear almost instantly and I have tomake my way to a rendezvous point to meet up with my scattered squad. I slowlynavigate the street, taking out Peacekeepers as I go. Two on the rooftop to myleft, another in the doorway up ahead. It’s challenging, but not as hard as Iwas expecting. There’s a nagging feeling that if it’s too simple, I must bemissing the point. I’m within a couple of buildings from my goal when thingsbegin to heat up. A half dozen Peacekeepers come charging around the corner.They will outgun me, but I notice something. A drum of gasoline lying carelesslyin the gutter. This is it. My test. To perceive that blowing up the drum will bethe only way to achieve my mission. Just as I step out to do it, my squadronleader, who’s been fairly useless up to this point, quietly orders me to hit theground. Every instinct I have screams for me to ignore the voice, to pull thetrigger, to blow the Peacekeepers sky-high. And suddenly, I realize what themilitary will think my biggest weakness is. From my first moment in the Games,when I ran for that orange backpack, to the firefight in 8, to my impulsive raceacross the square in 2. I cannot take orders.I smack into the ground so hard and fast, I’ll be picking gravel out of my chinfor a week. Someone else blows the gas tank. The Peacekeepers die. I make myrendezvous point. When I exit the Block on the far side, a soldier congratulatesme, stamps my hand with squad number 451, and tells me to report to Command.Almost giddy with success, I run through the halls, skidding around corners,bounding down the steps because the elevator’s too slow. I bang into the roombefore the oddity of the situation dawns on me. I shouldn’t be in Command; Ishould be getting my hair buzzed. The people around the table aren’t freshlyminted soldiers but the ones calling the shots.Boggs smiles and shakes his head when he sees me. “Let’s see it.” Unsure now, Ihold out my stamped hand. “You’re with me. It’s a special unit of sharpshooters.Join your squad.” He nods over at a group lining the wall. Gale. Finnick. Fiveothers I don’t know. My squad. I’m not only in, I get to work under Boggs. Withmy friends. I force myself to take calm, soldierly steps to join them, insteadof jumping up and down.We must be important, too, because we’re in Command, and it has nothing to dowith a certain Mockingjay. Plutarch stands over a wide, flat panel in the centerof the table. He’s explaining something about the nature of what we willencounter in the Capitol. I’m thinking this is a terrible presentation—becauseeven on tiptoe I can’t see what’s on the panel—until he hits a button. Aholographic image of a block of the Capitol projects into the air.“This, for example, is the area surrounding one of the Peacekeepers’ barracks.Not unimportant, but not the most crucial of targets, and yet look.” Plutarchenters some sort of code on a keyboard, and lights begin to flash. They’re in anassortment of colors and blink at different speeds. “Each light is called a pod.It represents a different obstacle, the nature of which could be anything from abomb to a band of mutts. Make no mistake, whatever it contains is designed toeither trap or kill you. Some have been in place since the Dark Days, othersdeveloped over the years. To be honest, I created a fair number myself. Thisprogram, which one of our people absconded with when we left the Capitol, is ourmost recent information. They don’t know we have it. But even so, it’s likelythat new pods have been activated in the last few months. This is what you willface.”I’m unaware that my feet are moving to the table until I’m inches from theholograph. My hand reaches in and cups a rapidly blinking green light.Someone joins me, his body tense. Finnick, of course. Because only a victorwould see what I see so immediately. The arena. Laced with pods controlled byGamemakers. Finnick’s fingers caress a steady red glow over a doorway. “Ladiesand gentlemen…”His voice is quiet, but mine rings through the room. “Let the Seventy-sixthHunger Games begin!”I laugh. Quickly. Before anyone has time to register what lies beneath the wordsI have just uttered. Before eyebrows are raised, objections are uttered, two andtwo are put together, and the solution is that I should be kept as far away fromthe Capitol as possible. Because an angry, independently thinking victor with alayer of psychological scar tissue too thick to penetrate is maybe the lastperson you want on your squad.“I don’t even know why you bothered to put Finnick and me through training,Plutarch,” I say.“Yeah, we’re already the two best-equipped soldiers you have,” Finnick addscockily.“Do not think that fact escapes me,” he says with an impatient wave. “Now backin line, Soldiers Odair and Everdeen. I have a presentation to finish.”We retreat to our places, ignoring the questioning looks thrown our way. I adoptan attitude of extreme concentration as Plutarch continues, nodding my head hereand there, shifting my position to get a better view, all the while tellingmyself to hang on until I can get to the woods and scream. Or curse. Or cry. Ormaybe all three at once.If this was a test, Finnick and I both pass it. When Plutarch finishes and themeeting’s adjourned, I have a bad moment when I learn there’s a special orderfor me. But it’s merely that I skip the military haircut because they would likethe Mockingjay to look as much like the girl in the arena as possible at theanticipated surrender. For the cameras, you know. I shrug to communicate that myhair length’s a matter of complete indifference to me. They dismiss me withoutfurther comment.Finnick and I gravitate toward each other in the hallway. “What will I tellAnnie?” he says under his breath.“Nothing,” I answer. “That’s what my mother and sister will be hearing from me.”Bad enough that we know we’re heading back into a fully equipped arena. No usedropping it on our loved ones.“If she sees that holograph—” he begins.“She won’t. It’s classified information. It must be,” I say. “Anyway, it’s notlike an actual Games. Any number of people will survive. We’re just overreactingbecause—well, you know why. You still want to go, don’t you?”“Of course. I want to destroy Snow as much as you do,” he says.“It won’t be like the others,” I say firmly, trying to convince myself as well.Then the real beauty of the situation dawns on me. “This time Snow will be aplayer, too.”Before we can continue, Haymitch appears. He wasn’t at the meeting, isn’tthinking of arenas but something else. “Johanna’s back in the hospital.”I assumed Johanna was fine, had passed her exam, but simply wasn’t assigned to asharpshooters’ unit. She’s wicked throwing an ax but about average with a gun.“Is she hurt? What happened?”“It was while she was on the Block. They try to ferret out a soldier’s potentialweaknesses. So they flooded the street,” says Haymitch.This doesn’t help. Johanna can swim. At least, I seem to remember her swimmingaround some in the Quarter Quell. Not like Finnick, of course, but none of usare like Finnick. “So?”“That’s how they tortured her in the Capitol. Soaked her and then used electricshocks,” says Haymitch. “In the Block she had some kind of flashback. Panicked,didn’t know where she was. She’s back under sedation.” Finnick and I just standthere, as if we’ve lost the ability to respond. I think of the way Johanna nevershowers. How she forced herself into the rain like it was acid that day. I hadattributed her misery to the morphling withdrawal.“You two should go see her. You’re as close to friends as she’s got,” saysHaymitch.That makes the whole thing worse. I don’t really know what’s between Johanna andFinnick. But I hardly know her. No family. No friends. Not so much as a tokenfrom 7 to set beside her regulation clothes in her anonymous drawer. Nothing.“I better go tell Plutarch. He won’t be happy,” Haymitch continues. “He wants asmany victors as possible for the cameras to follow in the Capitol. Thinks itmakes for better television.”“Are you and Beetee going?” I ask.“As many young and attractive victors as possible,” Haymitch corrects himself.“So, no. We’ll be here.”Finnick goes directly down to see Johanna, but I linger outside a few minutesuntil Boggs comes out. He’s my commander now, so I guess he’s the one to ask forany special favors. When I tell him what I want to do, he writes me a pass sothat I can go to the woods during Reflection, provided I stay within sight ofthe guards. I run to my compartment, thinking to use the parachute, but it’s sofull of ugly memories. Instead, I go across the hall and take one of the whitecotton bandages I brought from 12. Square. Sturdy. Just the thing.In the woods, I find a pine tree and strip handfuls of fragrant needles from theboughs. After making a neat pile in the middle of the bandage, I gather up thesides, give them a twist, and tie them tightly with a length of vine, making anapple-sized bundle.At the hospital room door, I watch Johanna for a moment, realize that most ofher ferocity is in her abrasive attitude. Stripped of that, as she is now,there’s only a slight young woman, her wide-set eyes fighting to stay awakeagainst the power of the drugs. Terrified of what sleep will bring. I cross toher and hold out the bundle.“What’s that?” she says hoarsely. Damp edges of her hair form little spikes overher forehead.“I made it for you. Something to put in your drawer.” I place it in her hands.“Smell it.”She lifts the bundle to her nose and takes a tentative sniff. “Smells likehome.” Tears flood her eyes.“That’s what I was hoping. You being from Seven and all,” I say. “Remember whenwe met? You were a tree. Well, briefly.”Suddenly, she has my wrist in an iron grip. “You have to kill him, Katniss.”“Don’t worry.” I resist the temptation to wrench my arm free.“Swear it. On something you care about,” she hisses.“I swear it. On my life.” But she doesn’t let go of my arm.“On your family’s life,” she insists.“On my family’s life,” I repeat. I guess my concern for my own survival isn’tcompelling enough. She lets go and I rub my wrist. “Why do you think I’m going,anyway, brainless?”That makes her smile a little. “I just needed to hear it.” She presses thebundle of pine needles to her nose and closes her eyes.The remaining days go by in a whirl. After a brief workout each morning, mysquad’s on the shooting range full-time in training. I practice mostly with agun, but they reserve an hour a day for specialty weapons, which means I get touse my Mockingjay bow, Gale his heavy militarized one. The trident Beeteedesigned for Finnick has a lot of special features, but the most remarkable isthat he can throw it, press a button on a metal cuff on his wrist, and return itto his hand without chasing it down.Sometimes we shoot at Peacekeeper dummies to become familiar with the weaknessesin their protective gear. The chinks in the armor, so to speak. If you hitflesh, you’re rewarded with a burst of fake blood. Our dummies are soaked inred.It’s reassuring to see just how high the overall level of accuracy is in ourgroup. Along with Finnick and Gale, the squad includes five soldiers from 13.Jackson, a middle-aged woman who’s Boggs’s second in command, looks kind ofsluggish but can hit things the rest of us can’t even see without a scope.Farsighted, she says. There’s a pair of sisters in their twenties named Leeg—wecall them Leeg 1 and Leeg 2 for clarity—who are so similar in uniform, I can’ttell them apart until I notice Leeg 1 has weird yellow flecks in her eyes. Twoolder guys, Mitchell and Homes, never say much but can shoot the dust off yourboots at fifty yards. I see other squads that are also quite good, but I don’tfully understand our status until the morning Plutarch joins us.“Squad Four-Five-One, you have been selected for a special mission,” he begins.I bite the inside of my lip, hoping against hope that it’s to assassinate Snow.“We have numerous sharpshooters, but rather a dearth of camera crews. Therefore,we’ve handpicked the eight of you to be what we call our ‘Star Squad.’ You willbe the on-screen faces of the invasion.”Disappointment, shock, then anger run through the group. “What you’re saying is,we won’t be in actual combat,” snaps Gale.“You will be in combat, but perhaps not always on the front line. If one caneven isolate a front line in this type of war,” says Plutarch.“None of us wants that.” Finnick’s remark is followed by a general rumble ofassent, but I stay silent. “We’re going to fight.”“You’re going to be as useful to the war effort as possible,” Plutarch says.“And it’s been decided that you are of most value on television. Just look atthe effect Katniss had running around in that Mockingjay suit. Turned the wholerebellion around. Do you notice how she’s the only one not complaining? It’sbecause she understands the power of that screen.”Actually, Katniss isn’t complaining because she has no intention of staying withthe “Star Squad,” but she recognizes the necessity of getting to the Capitolbefore carrying out any plan. Still, to be too compliant may arouse suspicion aswell.“But it’s not all pretend, is it?” I ask. “That’d be a waste of talent.”“Don’t worry,” Plutarch tells me. “You’ll have plenty of real targets to hit.But don’t get blown up. I’ve got enough on my plate without having to replaceyou. Now get to the Capitol and put on a good show.”The morning we ship out, I say good-bye to my family. I haven’t told them howmuch the Capitol’s defenses mirror the weapons in the arena, but my going off towar is awful enough on its own. My mother holds me tightly for a long time. Ifeel tears on her cheek, something she suppressed when I was slated for theGames. “Don’t worry. I’ll be perfectly safe. I’m not even a real soldier. Justone of Plutarch’s televised puppets,” I reassure her.Prim walks me as far as the hospital doors. “How do you feel?”“Better, knowing you’re somewhere Snow can’t reach you,” I say.“Next time we see each other, we’ll be free of him,” says Prim firmly. Then shethrows her arms around my neck. “Be careful.”I consider saying a final good-bye to Peeta, decide it would only be bad forboth of us. But I do slip the pearl into the pocket of my uniform. A token ofthe boy with the bread.A hovercraft takes us to, of all places, 12, where a makeshift transportationarea has been set up outside the fire zone. No luxury trains this time, but acargo car packed to the limit with soldiers in their dark gray uniforms,sleeping with their heads on their packs. After a couple of days’ travel, wedisembark inside one of the mountain tunnels leading to the Capitol, and makethe rest of the six-hour trek on foot, taking care to step only on a glowinggreen paint line that marks safe passage to the air above.We come out in the rebel encampment, a ten-block stretch outside the trainstation where Peeta and I made our previous arrivals. It’s already crawling withsoldiers. Squad 451 is assigned a spot to pitch its tents. This area has beensecured for over a week. Rebels pushed out the Peacekeepers, losing hundreds oflives in the process. The Capitol forces fell back and have regrouped fartherinto the city. Between us lie the booby-trapped streets, empty and inviting.Each one will need to be swept of pods before we can advance.Mitchell asks about hoverplane bombings—we do feel very naked pitched out in theopen—but Boggs says it’s not an issue. Most of the Capitol’s air fleet wasdestroyed in 2 or during the invasion. If it has any craft left, it’s holding onto them. Probably so Snow and his inner circle can make a last-minute escape tosome presidential bunker somewhere if needed. Our own hoverplanes were groundedafter the Capitol’s antiaircraft missiles decimated the first few waves. Thiswar will be battled out on the streets with, hopefully, only superficial damageto the infrastructure and a minimum of human casualties. The rebels want theCapitol, just as the Capitol wanted 13.After three days, much of Squad 451 risks deserting out of boredom. Cressida andher team take shots of us firing. They tell us we’re part of the disinformationteam. If the rebels only shoot Plutarch’s pods, it will take the Capitol abouttwo minutes to realize we have the holograph. So there’s a lot of time spentshattering things that don’t matter, to throw them off the scent. Mostly we justadd to the piles of rainbow glass that’s been blown off the exteriors of thecandy-colored buildings. I suspect they are intercutting this footage with thedestruction of significant Capitol targets. Once in a while it seems a realsharpshooter’s services are needed. Eight hands go up, but Gale, Finnick, and Iare never chosen.“It’s your own fault for being so camera-ready,” I tell Gale. If looks couldkill.I don’t think they quite know what to do with the three of us, particularly me.I have my Mockingjay outfit with me, but I’ve only been taped in my uniform.Sometimes I use a gun, sometimes they ask me to shoot with my bow and arrows.It’s as if they don’t want to entirely lose the Mockingjay, but they want todowngrade my role to foot soldier. Since I don’t care, it’s amusing rather thanupsetting to imagine the arguments going on back in 13.While I outwardly express discontent about our lack of any real participation,I’m busy with my own agenda. Each of us has a paper map of the Capitol. The cityforms an almost perfect square. Lines divide the map into smaller squares, withletters along the top and numbers down the side to form a grid. I consume this,noting every intersection and side street, but it’s remedial stuff. Thecommanders here are working off Plutarch’s holograph. Each has a handheldcontraption called a Holo that produces images like I saw in Command. They canzoom into any area of the grid and see what pods await them. The Holo’s anindependent unit, a glorified map really, since it can neither send nor receivesignals. But it’s far superior to my paper version.A Holo is activated by a specific commander’s voice giving his or her name. Onceit’s working, it responds to the other voices in the squadron so if, say, Boggswere killed or severely disabled, someone could take over. If anyone in thesquad repeats “nightlock” three times in a row, the Holo will explode, blowingeverything in a five-yard radius sky-high. This is for security reasons in theevent of capture. It’s understood that we would all do this without hesitation.So what I need to do is steal Boggs’s activated Holo and clear out before henotices. I think it would be easier to steal his teeth.On the fourth morning, Soldier Leeg 2 hits a mislabeled pod. It doesn’t unleasha swarm of muttation gnats, which the rebels are prepared for, but shoots out asunburst of metal darts. One finds her brain. She’s gone before the medics canreach her. Plutarch promises a speedy replacement.The following evening, the newest member of our squad arrives. With no manacles.No guards. Strolling out of the train station with his gun swinging from thestrap over his shoulder. There’s shock, confusion, resistance, but 451 isstamped on the back of Peeta’s hand in fresh ink. Boggs relieves him of hisweapon and goes to make a call.“It won’t matter,” Peeta tells the rest of us. “The president assigned meherself. She decided the propos needed some heating up.”Maybe they do. But if Coin sent Peeta here, she’s decided something else aswell. That I’m of more use to her dead than alive."},{"pageContent":"PART III [mockingjay_TOC.html#pt_03]“THE ASSASSIN” [mockingjay_TOC.html#pt_03]"},{"pageContent":"19 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_19]I’ve never really seen Boggs angry before. Not when I’ve disobeyed his orders orpuked on him, not even when Gale broke his nose. But he’s angry when he returnsfrom his phone call with the president. The first thing he does is instructSoldier Jackson, his second in command, to set up a two-person, round-the-clockguard on Peeta. Then he takes me on a walk, weaving through the sprawling tentencampment until our squad is far behind us.“He’ll try and kill me anyway,” I say. “Especially here. Where there are so manybad memories to set him off.”“I’ll keep him contained, Katniss,” says Boggs.“Why does Coin want me dead now?” I ask.“She denies she does,” he answers.“But we know it’s true,” I say. “And you must at least have a theory.”Boggs gives me a long, hard look before he answers. “Here’s as much as I know.The president doesn’t like you. She never did. It was Peeta she wanted rescuedfrom the arena, but no one else agreed. It made matters worse when you forcedher to give the other victors immunity. But even that could be overlooked inview of how well you’ve performed.”“Then what is it?” I insist.“Sometime in the near future, this war will be resolved. A new leader will bechosen,” says Boggs.I roll my eyes. “Boggs, no one thinks I’m going to be the leader.”“No. They don’t,” he agrees. “But you’ll throw support to someone. Would it bePresident Coin? Or someone else?”“I don’t know. I’ve never thought about it,” I say.“If your immediate answer isn’t Coin, then you’re a threat. You’re the face ofthe rebellion. You may have more influence than any other single person,” saysBoggs. “Outwardly, the most you’ve ever done is tolerated her.”“So she’ll kill me to shut me up.” The minute I say the words, I know they’retrue.“She doesn’t need you as a rallying point now. As she said, your primaryobjective, to unite the districts, has succeeded,” Boggs reminds me. “Thesecurrent propos could be done without you. There’s only one last thing you coulddo to add fire to the rebellion.”“Die,” I say quietly.“Yes. Give us a martyr to fight for,” says Boggs. “But that’s not going tohappen under my watch, Soldier Everdeen. I’m planning for you to have a longlife.”“Why?” This kind of thinking will only bring him trouble. “You don’t owe meanything.”“Because you’ve earned it,” he says. “Now get back to your squad.”I know I should feel appreciative of Boggs sticking his neck out for me, butreally I’m just frustrated. I mean, how can I steal his Holo and desert now?Betraying him was complicated enough without this whole new layer of debt. Ialready owe him for saving my life.Seeing the cause of my current dilemma calmly pitching his tent back at our sitemakes me furious. “What time is my watch?” I ask Jackson.She squints at me in doubt, or maybe she’s just trying to get my face in focus.“I didn’t put you in the rotation.”“Why not?” I ask.“I’m not sure you could really shoot Peeta, if it came to it,” she says.I speak up so the whole squad can hear me clearly. “I wouldn’t be shootingPeeta. He’s gone. Johanna’s right. It’d be just like shooting another of theCapitol’s mutts.” It feels good to say something horrible about him, out loud,in public, after all the humiliation I’ve felt since his return.“Well, that sort of comment isn’t recommending you either,” says Jackson.“Put her in the rotation,” I hear Boggs say behind me.Jackson shakes her head and makes a note. “Midnight to four. You’re on with me.”The dinner whistle sounds, and Gale and I line up at the canteen. “Do you wantme to kill him?” he asks bluntly.“That’ll get us both sent back for sure,” I say. But even though I’m furious,the brutality of the offer rattles me. “I can deal with him.”“You mean until you take off? You and your paper map and possibly a Holo if youcan get your hands on it?” So Gale has not missed my preparations. I hope theyhaven’t been so obvious to the others. None of them know my mind like he does,though. “You’re not planning on leaving me behind, are you?” he asks.Up until this point, I was. But having my hunting partner to watch my backdoesn’t sound like a bad idea. “As your fellow soldier, I have to stronglyrecommend you stay with your squad. But I can’t stop you from coming, can I?”He grins. “No. Not unless you want me to alert the rest of the army.”Squad 451 and the television crew collect dinner from the canteen and gather ina tense circle to eat. At first I think that Peeta is the cause of the unease,but by the end of the meal, I realize more than a few unfriendly looks have beendirected my way. This is a quick turnaround, since I’m pretty sure when Peetaappeared the whole team was concerned about how dangerous he might be,especially to me. But it’s not until I get a phone call through to Haymitch thatI understand.“What are you trying to do? Provoke him into an attack?” he asks me.“Of course not. I just want him to leave me alone,” I say.“Well, he can’t. Not after what the Capitol put him through,” says Haymitch.“Look, Coin may have sent him there hoping he’d kill you, but Peeta doesn’t knowthat. He doesn’t understand what’s happened to him. So you can’t blame him—”“I don’t!” I say.“You do! You’re punishing him over and over for things that are out of hiscontrol. Now, I’m not saying you shouldn’t have a fully loaded weapon next toyou round the clock. But I think it’s time you flipped this little scenarioaround in your head. If you’d been taken by the Capitol, and hijacked, and thentried to kill Peeta, is this the way he would be treating you?” demandsHaymitch.I fall silent. It isn’t. It isn’t how he would be treating me at all. He wouldbe trying to get me back at any cost. Not shutting me out, abandoning me,greeting me with hostility at every turn.“You and me, we made a deal to try and save him. Remember?” Haymitch says. WhenI don’t respond, he disconnects after a curt “Try and remember.”The autumn day turns from brisk to cold. Most of the squad hunker down in theirsleeping bags. Some sleep under the open sky, close to the heater in the centerof our camp, while others retreat to their tents. Leeg 1 has finally broken downover her sister’s death, and her muffled sobs reach us through the canvas. Ihuddle in my tent, thinking over Haymitch’s words. Realizing with shame that myfixation with assassinating Snow has allowed me to ignore a much more difficultproblem. Trying to rescue Peeta from the shadowy world the hijacking hasstranded him in. I don’t know how to find him, let alone lead him out. I can’teven conceive of a plan. It makes the task of crossing a loaded arena, locatingSnow, and putting a bullet through his head look like child’s play.At midnight, I crawl out of my tent and position myself on a camp stool near theheater to take my watch with Jackson. Boggs told Peeta to sleep out in full viewwhere the rest of us could keep an eye on him. He isn’t sleeping, though.Instead, he sits with his bag pulled up to his chest, clumsily trying to makeknots in a short length of rope. I know it well. It’s the one Finnick lent methat night in the bunker. Seeing it in his hands, it’s like Finnick’s echoingwhat Haymitch just said, that I’ve cast off Peeta. Now might be a good time tobegin to remedy that. If I could think of something to say. But I can’t. So Idon’t. I just let the sounds of soldiers’ breathing fill the night.After about an hour, Peeta speaks up. “These last couple of years must have beenexhausting for you. Trying to decide whether to kill me or not. Back and forth.Back and forth.”That seems grossly unfair, and my first impulse is to say something cutting. ButI revisit my conversation with Haymitch and try to take the first tentative stepin Peeta’s direction. “I never wanted to kill you. Except when I thought youwere helping the Careers kill me. After that, I always thought of you as…anally.” That’s a good safe word. Empty of any emotional obligation, butnonthreatening.“Ally.” Peeta says the word slowly, tasting it. “Friend. Lover. Victor. Enemy.Fiancée. Target. Mutt. Neighbor. Hunter. Tribute. Ally. I’ll add it to the listof words I use to try to figure you out.” He weaves the rope in and out of hisfingers. “The problem is, I can’t tell what’s real anymore, and what’s made up.”The cessation of rhythmic breathing suggests that either people have woken orhave never really been asleep at all. I suspect the latter.Finnick’s voice rises from a bundle in the shadows. “Then you should ask, Peeta.That’s what Annie does.”“Ask who?” Peeta says. “Who can I trust?”“Well, us for starters. We’re your squad,” says Jackson.“You’re my guards,” he points out.“That, too,” she says. “But you saved a lot of lives in Thirteen. It’s not thekind of thing we forget.”In the quiet that follows, I try to imagine not being able to tell illusion fromreality. Not knowing if Prim or my mother loved me. If Snow was my enemy. If theperson across the heater saved or sacrificed me. With very little effort, mylife rapidly morphs into a nightmare. I suddenly want to tell Peeta everythingabout who he is, and who I am, and how we ended up here. But I don’t know how tostart. Worthless. I’m worthless.At a few minutes before four, Peeta turns to me again. “Your favorite color…it’sgreen?”“That’s right.” Then I think of something to add. “And yours is orange.”“Orange?” He seems unconvinced.“Not bright orange. But soft. Like the sunset,” I say. “At least, that’s whatyou told me once.”“Oh.” He closes his eyes briefly, maybe trying to conjure up that sunset, thennods his head. “Thank you.”But more words tumble out. “You’re a painter. You’re a baker. You like to sleepwith the windows open. You never take sugar in your tea. And you alwaysdouble-knot your shoelaces.”Then I dive into my tent before I do something stupid like cry.In the morning, Gale, Finnick, and I go out to shoot some glass off thebuildings for the camera crew. When we get back to camp, Peeta’s sitting in acircle with the soldiers from 13, who are armed but talking openly with him.Jackson has devised a game called “Real or Not Real” to help Peeta. He mentionssomething he thinks happened, and they tell him if it’s true or imagined,usually followed by a brief explanation.“Most of the people from Twelve were killed in the fire.”“Real. Less than nine hundred of you made it to Thirteen alive.”“The fire was my fault.”“Not real. President Snow destroyed Twelve the way he did Thirteen, to send amessage to the rebels.”This seems like a good idea until I realize that I’ll be the only one who canconfirm or deny most of what weighs on him. Jackson breaks us up into watches.She matches up Finnick, Gale, and me each with a soldier from 13. This way Peetawill always have access to someone who knows him more personally. It’s not asteady conversation. Peeta spends a long time considering even small pieces ofinformation, like where people bought their soap back home. Gale fills him in ona lot of stuff about 12; Finnick is the expert on both of Peeta’s Games, as hewas a mentor in the first and a tribute in the second. But since Peeta’sgreatest confusion centers around me—and not everything can be explainedsimply—our exchanges are painful and loaded, even though we touch on only themost superficial of details. The color of my dress in 7. My preference forcheese buns. The name of our math teacher when we were little. Reconstructinghis memory of me is excruciating. Perhaps it isn’t even possible after what Snowdid to him. But it does feel right to help him try.The next afternoon, we’re notified that the whole squad is needed to stage afairly complicated propo. Peeta’s been right about one thing: Coin and Plutarchare unhappy with the quality of footage they’re getting from the Star Squad.Very dull. Very uninspiring. The obvious response is that they never let us doanything but playact with our guns. However, this is not about defendingourselves, it’s about coming up with a usable product. So today, a special blockhas been set aside for filming. It even has a couple of active pods on it. Oneunleashes a spray of gunfire. The other nets the invader and traps them foreither interrogation or execution, depending on the captors’ preference. Butit’s still an unimportant residential block with nothing of strategicconsequence.The television crew means to provide a sense of heightened jeopardy by releasingsmoke bombs and adding gunfire sound effects. We suit up in heavy protectivegear, even the crew, as if we’re heading into the heart of battle. Those of uswith specialty weapons are allowed to take them along with our guns. Boggs givesPeeta back his gun, too, although he makes sure to tell him in a loud voice thatit’s only loaded with blanks.Peeta just shrugs. “I’m not much of a shot anyway.” He seems preoccupied withwatching Pollux, to the point where it’s getting a little worrisome, when hefinally puzzles it out and begins to speak with agitation. “You’re an Avox,aren’t you? I can tell by the way you swallow. There were two Avoxes with me inprison. Darius and Lavinia, but the guards mostly called them the redheads.They’d been our servants in the Training Center, so they arrested them, too. Iwatched them being tortured to death. She was lucky. They used too much voltageand her heart stopped right off. It took days to finish him off. Beating,cutting off parts. They kept asking him questions, but he couldn’t speak, hejust made these horrible animal sounds. They didn’t want information, you know?They wanted me to see it.”Peeta looks around at our stunned faces, as if waiting for a reply. When none isforthcoming, he asks, “Real or not real?” The lack of response upsets him more.“Real or not real?!” he demands.“Real,” says Boggs. “At least, to the best of my knowledge…real.”Peeta sags. “I thought so. There was nothing…shiny about it.” He wanders awayfrom the group, muttering something about fingers and toes.I move to Gale, press my forehead into the body armor where his chest should be,feel his arm tighten around me. We finally know the name of the girl who wewatched the Capitol abduct from the woods of 12, the fate of the Peacekeeperfriend who tried to keep Gale alive. This is no time to call up happy moments ofremembrance. They lost their lives because of me. I add them to my personal listof kills that began in the arena and now includes thousands. When I look up, Isee it has taken Gale differently. His expression says that there are not enoughmountains to crush, enough cities to destroy. It promises death.With Peeta’s grisly account fresh in our minds, we crunch through the streets ofbroken glass until we reach our target, the block we are to take. It is a real,if small, goal to accomplish. We gather around Boggs to examine the Holoprojection of the street. The gunfire pod is positioned about a third of the waydown, just above an apartment awning. We should be able to trigger it withbullets. The net pod is at the far end, almost the next corner. This willrequire someone to set off the body sensor mechanism. Everyone volunteers exceptPeeta, who doesn’t seem to know quite what’s going on. I don’t get picked. I getsent to Messalla, who dabs some makeup on my face for the anticipated close-ups.The squad positions itself under Boggs’s direction, and then we have to wait forCressida to get the cameramen in place as well. They’re both to our left, withCastor toward the front and Pollux bringing up the rear so they’ll be sure notto record each other. Messalla sets off a couple of smoke charges foratmosphere. Since this is both a mission and a shoot, I’m about to ask who’s incharge, my commander or my director, when Cressida calls, “Action!”We slowly proceed down the hazy street, just like one of our exercises in theBlock. Everyone has at least one section of windows to blow out, but Gale’sassigned the real target. When he hits the pod, we take cover—ducking intodoorways or flattening onto the pretty, light orange and pink paving stones—as ahail of bullets sweeps back and forth over our heads. After a while, Boggsorders us forward.Cressida stops us before we can rise, since she needs some close-up shots. Wetake turns reenacting our responses. Falling to the ground, grimacing, divinginto alcoves. We know it’s supposed to be serious business, but the whole thingfeels a little ridiculous. Especially when it turns out that I’m not the worstactor in the squad. Not by a long shot. We’re all laughing so hard at Mitchell’sattempt to project his idea of desperation, which involves teeth grinding andnostrils flaring, that Boggs has to reprimand us.“Pull it together, Four-Five-One,” he says firmly. But you can see himsuppressing a smile as he’s double-checking the next pod. Positioning the Holoto find the best light in the smoky air. Still facing us as his left foot stepsback onto the orange paving stone. Triggering the bomb that blows off his legs."},{"pageContent":"20 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_20]It’s as if in an instant, a painted window shatters, revealing the ugly worldbehind it. Laughter changes to screams, blood stains pastel stones, real smokedarkens the special effect stuff made for television.A second explosion seems to split the air and leaves my ears ringing. But Ican’t make out where it came from.I reach Boggs first, try to make sense of the torn flesh, missing limbs, to findsomething to stem the red flow from his body. Homes pushes me aside, wrenchingopen a first-aid kit. Boggs clutches my wrist. His face, gray with dying andash, seems to be receding. But his next words are an order. “The Holo.”The Holo. I scramble around, digging through chunks of tile slick with blood,shuddering when I encounter bits of warm flesh. Find it rammed into a stairwellwith one of Boggs’s boots. Retrieve it, wiping it clean with bare hands as Ireturn it to my commander.Homes has the stump of Boggs’s left thigh cupped by some sort of compressionbandage, but it’s already soaked through. He’s trying to tourniquet the otherabove the existing knee. The rest of the squad has gathered in a protectiveformation around the crew and us. Finnick’s attempting to revive Messalla, whowas thrown into a wall by the explosion. Jackson’s barking into a fieldcommunicator, trying unsuccessfully to alert the camp to send medics, but I knowit’s too late. As a child, watching my mother work, I learned that once a poolof blood has reached a certain size, there’s no going back.I kneel beside Boggs, prepared to repeat the role I played with Rue, with themorphling from 6, giving him someone to hold on to as he’s released from life.But Boggs has both hands working the Holo. He’s typing in a command, pressinghis thumb to the screen for print recognition, speaking a string of letters andnumbers in response to a prompt. A green shaft of light bursts out of the Holoand illuminates his face. He says, “Unfit for command. Transfer of primesecurity clearance to Squad Four-Five-One Soldier Katniss Everdeen.” It’s all hecan do to turn the Holo toward my face. “Say your name.”“Katniss Everdeen,” I say into the green shaft. Suddenly, it has me trapped inits light. I can’t move or even blink as images flicker rapidly before me.Scanning me? Recording me? Blinding me? It vanishes, and I shake my head toclear it. “What did you do?”“Prepare to retreat!” Jackson hollers.Finnick’s yelling something back, gesturing to the end of the block where weentered. Black, oily matter spouts like a geyser from the street, billowingbetween the buildings, creating an impenetrable wall of darkness. It seems to beneither liquid nor gas, mechanical nor natural. Surely it’s lethal. There’s noheading back the way we came.Deafening gunfire as Gale and Leeg 1 begin to blast a path across the stonestoward the far end of the block. I don’t know what they’re doing until anotherbomb, ten yards away, detonates, opening a hole in the street. Then I realizethis is a rudimentary attempt at minesweeping. Homes and I latch on to Boggs andbegin to drag him after Gale. Agony takes over and he’s crying out in pain and Iwant to stop, to find a better way, but the blackness is rising above thebuildings, swelling, rolling at us like a wave.I’m yanked backward, lose my grip on Boggs, slam into the stones. Peeta looksdown at me, gone, mad, flashing back into the land of the hijacked, his gunraised over me, descending to crush my skull. I roll, hear the butt slam intothe street, catch the tumble of bodies out of the corner of my eye as Mitchelltackles Peeta and pins him to the ground. But Peeta, always so powerful and nowfueled by tracker jacker insanity, gets his feet under Mitchell’s belly andlaunches him farther down the block.There’s a loud snap of a trap as the pod triggers. Four cables, attached totracks on the buildings, break through the stones, dragging up the net thatencases Mitchell. It makes no sense—how instantly bloodied he is—until we seethe barbs sticking from the wire that encases him. I know it immediately. Itdecorated the top of the fence around 12. As I call to him not to move, I gag onthe smell of the blackness, thick, tarlike. The wave has crested and begun tofall.Gale and Leeg 1 shoot through the front door lock of the corner building, thenbegin to fire at the cables holding Mitchell’s net. Others are restraining Peetanow. I lunge back to Boggs, and Homes and I drag him inside the apartment,through someone’s pink and white velvet living room, down a hallway hung withfamily photos, onto the marble floor of a kitchen, where we collapse. Castor andPollux carry in a writhing Peeta between them. Somehow Jackson gets cuffs onhim, but it only makes him wilder and they’re forced to lock him in a closet.In the living room, the front door slams, people shout. Then footsteps pounddown the hall as the black wave roars past the building. From the kitchen, wecan hear the windows groan, shatter. The noxious tar smell permeates the air.Finnick carries in Messalla. Leeg 1 and Cressida stumble into the room afterthem, coughing.“Gale!” I shriek.He’s there, slamming the kitchen door shut behind him, choking out one word.“Fumes!” Castor and Pollux grab towels, aprons to stuff in the cracks as Galeretches into a bright yellow sink.“Mitchell?” asks Homes. Leeg 1 just shakes her head.Boggs forces the Holo into my hand. His lips are moving, but I can’t make outwhat he’s saying. I lean my ear down to his mouth to catch his harsh whisper.“Don’t trust them. Don’t go back. Kill Peeta. Do what you came to do.”I draw back so I can see his face. “What? Boggs? Boggs?” His eyes are stillopen, but dead. Pressed in my hand, glued to it by his blood, is the Holo.Peeta’s feet slamming into the closet door break up the ragged breathing of theothers. But even as we listen, his energy seems to ebb. The kicks diminish to anirregular drumming. Then nothing. I wonder if he, too, is dead.“He’s gone?” Finnick asks, looking down at Boggs. I nod. “We need to get out ofhere. Now. We just set off a streetful of pods. You can bet they’ve got us onsurveillance tapes.”“Count on it,” says Castor. “All the streets are covered by surveillancecameras. I bet they set off the black wave manually when they saw us taping thepropo.”“Our radio communicators went dead almost immediately. Probably anelectromagnetic pulse device. But I’ll get us back to camp. Give me the Holo.”Jackson reaches for the unit, but I clutch it to my chest.“No. Boggs gave it to me,” I say.“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snaps. Of course, she thinks it’s hers. She’s secondin command.“It’s true,” says Homes. “He transferred the prime security clearance to herwhile he was dying. I saw it.”“Why would he do that?” demands Jackson.Why indeed? My head’s reeling from the ghastly events of the last fiveminutes—Boggs mutilated, dying, dead, Peeta’s homicidal rage, Mitchell bloodyand netted and swallowed by that foul black wave. I turn to Boggs, very badlyneeding him alive. Suddenly sure that he, and maybe he alone, is completely onmy side. I think of his last orders….“Don’t trust them. Don’t go back. Kill Peeta. Do what you came to do.”What did he mean? Don’t trust who? The rebels? Coin? The people looking at meright now? I won’t go back, but he must know I can’t just fire a bullet throughPeeta’s head. Can I? Should I? Did Boggs guess that what I really came to do isdesert and kill Snow on my own?I can’t work all of this out now, so I just decide to carry out the first twoorders: to not trust anyone and to move deeper into the Capitol. But how can Ijustify this? Make them let me keep the Holo?“Because I’m on a special mission for President Coin. I think Boggs was the onlyone who knew about it.”This in no way convinces Jackson. “To do what?”Why not tell them the truth? It’s as plausible as anything I’ll come up with.But it must seem like a real mission, not revenge. “To assassinate PresidentSnow before the loss of life from this war makes our population unsustainable.”“I don’t believe you,” says Jackson. “As your current commander, I order you totransfer the prime security clearance over to me.”“No,” I say. “That would be in direct violation of President Coin’s orders.”Guns are pointed. Half the squad at Jackson, half at me. Someone’s about to die,when Cressida speaks up. “It’s true. That’s why we’re here. Plutarch wants ittelevised. He thinks if we can film the Mockingjay assassinating Snow, it willend the war.”This gives even Jackson pause. Then she gestures with her gun toward the closet.“And why is he here?”There she has me. I can think of no sane reason that Coin would send an unstableboy, programmed to kill me, along on such a key assignment. It really weakens mystory. Cressida comes to my aid again. “Because the two post-Games interviewswith Caesar Flickerman were shot in President Snow’s personal quarters. Plutarchthinks Peeta may be of some use as a guide in a location we have littleknowledge of.”I want to ask Cressida why she’s lying for me, why she’s fighting for us to goon with my self-appointed mission. Now’s not the time.“We have to go!” says Gale. “I’m following Katniss. If you don’t want to, headback to camp. But let’s move!”Homes unlocks the closet and heaves an unconscious Peeta over his shoulder.“Ready.”“Boggs?” says Leeg 1.“We can’t take him. He’d understand,” says Finnick. He frees Boggs’s gun fromhis shoulder and slings the strap over his own. “Lead on, Soldier Everdeen.”I don’t know how to lead on. I look at the Holo for direction. It’s stillactivated, but it might as well be dead for all the good that does me. There’sno time for fiddling around with the buttons, trying to figure out how to workit. “I don’t know how to use this. Boggs said you would help me,” I tellJackson. “He said I could count on you.”Jackson scowls, snatches the Holo from me, and taps in a command. Anintersection comes up. “If we go out the kitchen door, there’s a smallcourtyard, then the back side of another corner apartment unit. We’re looking atan overview of the four streets that meet at the intersection.”I try to get my bearings as I stare at the cross section of the map blinkingwith pods in every direction. And those are only the pods Plutarch knows about.The Holo didn’t indicate that the block we just left was mined, had the blackgeyser, or that the net was made from barbed wire. Besides that, there may bePeacekeepers to deal with, now that they know our position. I bite the inside ofmy lip, feeling everyone’s eyes on me. “Put on your masks. We’re going out theway we came in.”Instant objections. I raise my voice over them. “If the wave was that powerful,then it may have triggered and absorbed other pods in our path.”People stop to consider this. Pollux makes a few quick signs to his brother. “Itmay have disabled the cameras as well,” Castor translates. “Coated the lenses.”Gale props one of his boots on the counter and examines the splatter of black onthe toe. Scrapes it with a kitchen knife from a block on the counter. “It’s notcorrosive. I think it was meant to either suffocate or poison us.”“Probably our best shot,” says Leeg 1.Masks go on. Finnick adjusts Peeta’s mask over his lifeless face. Cressida andLeeg 1 prop up a woozy Messalla between them.I’m waiting for someone to take the point position when I remember that’s my jobnow. I push on the kitchen door and meet with no resistance. A half-inch layerof the black goo has spread from the living room about three-quarters of the waydown the hall. When I gingerly test it with the toe of my boot, I find it hasthe consistency of a gel. I lift my foot and after stretching slightly, itsprings back into place. I take three steps into the gel and look back. Nofootprints. It’s the first good thing that’s happened today. The gel becomesslightly thicker as I cross the living room. I ease open the front door,expecting gallons of the stuff to pour in, but it holds its form.The pink and orange block seems to have been dipped in glossy black paint andset out to dry. Paving stones, buildings, even the rooftops are coated in thegel. A large teardrop hangs above the street. Two shapes project from it. A gunbarrel and a human hand. Mitchell. I wait on the sidewalk, staring up at himuntil the entire group has joined me.“If anyone needs to go back, for whatever reason, now is the time,” I say. “Noquestions asked, no hard feelings.” No one seems inclined to retreat. So I startmoving into the Capitol, knowing we don’t have much time. The gel’s deeper here,four to six inches, and makes a sucking sound each time you pick up your foot,but it still covers our tracks.The wave must have been enormous, with tremendous power behind it, as it’saffected several blocks that lie ahead. And though I tread with care, I think myinstinct was right about its triggering other pods. One block is sprinkled withthe golden bodies of tracker jackers. They must have been set free only tosuccumb to the fumes. A little farther along, an entire apartment building hascollapsed and lies in a mound under the gel. I sprint across the intersections,holding up a hand for the others to wait while I look for trouble, but the waveseems to have dismantled the pods far better than any squad of rebels could.On the fifth block, I can tell that we’ve reached the point where the wave beganto peter out. The gel’s only an inch deep, and I can see baby blue rooftopspeeking out across the next intersection. The afternoon light has faded, and webadly need to get under cover and form a plan. I choose an apartment two-thirdsof the way down the block. Homes jimmies the lock, and I order the othersinside. I stay on the street for just a minute, watching the last of ourfootprints fade away, then close the door behind me.Flashlights built into our guns illuminate a large living room with mirroredwalls that throw our faces back at us at every turn. Gale checks the windows,which show no damage, and removes his mask. “It’s all right. You can smell it,but it’s not too strong.”The apartment seems to be laid out exactly like the first one we took refuge in.The gel blacks out any natural daylight in the front, but some light still slipsthrough the shutters in the kitchen. Along the hallway are two bedrooms withbaths. A spiral staircase in the living room leads up to an open space thatcomposes much of the second floor. There are no windows upstairs, but the lightshave been left on, probably by someone hastily evacuating. A huge televisionscreen, blank but glowing softly, occupies one wall. Plush chairs and sofas arestrewn around the room. This is where we congregate, slump into upholstery, tryto catch our breath.Jackson has her gun trained on Peeta even though he’s still cuffed andunconscious, draped across a deep-blue sofa where Homes deposited him. What onearth am I going to do with him? With the crew? With everybody, frankly, besidesGale and Finnick? Because I’d rather track down Snow with those two than withoutthem. But I can’t lead ten people through the Capitol on a pretend mission, evenif I could read the Holo. Should I, could I have sent them back when I had achance? Or was it too dangerous? Both to them personally and to my mission?Maybe I shouldn’t have listened to Boggs, because he might have been in somedelusional death state. Maybe I should just come clean, but then Jackson wouldtake over and we’d end up back at camp. Where I’d have Coin to answer to.Just as the complexity of the mess I’ve dragged everybody into begins tooverload my brain, a distant chain of explosions sends a tremor through theroom.“It wasn’t close,” Jackson assures us. “A good four or five blocks away.”“Where we left Boggs,” says Leeg 1.Although no one has made a move toward it, the television flares to life,emitting a high-pitched beeping sound, bringing half our party to its feet.“It’s all right!” calls Cressida. “It’s just an emergency broadcast. EveryCapitol television is automatically activated for it.”There we are on-screen, just after the bomb took out Boggs. A voice-over tellsthe audience what they are viewing as we try to regroup, react to the black gelshooting from the street, lose control of the situation. We watch the chaos thatfollows until the wave blots out the cameras. The last thing we see is Gale,alone on the street, trying to shoot through the cables that hold Mitchellaloft.The reporter identifies Gale, Finnick, Boggs, Peeta, Cressida, and me by name.“There’s no aerial footage. Boggs must have been right about their hovercraftcapacity,” says Castor. I didn’t notice this, but I guess it’s the kind of thinga cameraman picks up on.Coverage continues from the courtyard behind the apartment where we tookshelter. Peacekeepers line the roof across from our former hideout. Shells arelaunched into the row of apartments, setting off the chain of explosions weheard, and the building collapses into rubble and dust.Now we cut to a live feed. A reporter stands on the roof with the Peacekeepers.Behind her, the apartment block burns. Firefighters try to control the blazewith water hoses. We are pronounced dead.“Finally, a bit of luck,” says Homes.I guess he’s right. Certainly it’s better than having the Capitol in pursuit ofus. But I just keep imagining how this will be playing back in 13. Where mymother and Prim, Hazelle and the kids, Annie, Haymitch, and a whole lot ofpeople from 13 think that they have just seen us die.“My father. He just lost my sister and now…” says Leeg 1.We watch as they play the footage over and over. Revel in their victory,especially over me. Break away to do a montage of the Mockingjay’s rise to rebelpower—I think they’ve had this part prepared for a while, because it seemspretty polished—and then go live so a couple of reporters can discuss mywell-deserved violent end. Later, they promise, Snow will make an officialstatement. The screen fades back to a glow.The rebels made no attempt to break in during the broadcast, which leads me tobelieve they think it’s true. If that’s so, we really are on our own.“So, now that we’re dead, what’s our next move?” asks Gale.“Isn’t it obvious?” No one even knew Peeta had regained consciousness. I don’tknow how long he’s been watching, but by the look of misery on his face, longenough to see what happened on the street. How he went mad, tried to bash myhead in, and hurled Mitchell into the pod. He painfully pushes himself up to asitting position and directs his words to Gale.“Our next move…is to kill me.”"},{"pageContent":"21 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_21]That makes two requests for Peeta’s death in less than an hour.“Don’t be ridiculous,” says Jackson.“I just murdered a member of our squad!” shouts Peeta.“You pushed him off you. You couldn’t have known he would trigger the net atthat exact spot,” says Finnick, trying to calm him.“Who cares? He’s dead, isn’t he?” Tears begin to run down Peeta’s face. “Ididn’t know. I’ve never seen myself like that before. Katniss is right. I’m themonster. I’m the mutt. I’m the one Snow has turned into a weapon!”“It’s not your fault, Peeta,” says Finnick.“You can’t take me with you. It’s only a matter of time before I kill someoneelse.” Peeta looks around at our conflicted faces. “Maybe you think it’s kinderto just dump me somewhere. Let me take my chances. But that’s the same thing ashanding me over to the Capitol. Do you think you’d be doing me a favor bysending me back to Snow?”Peeta. Back in Snow’s hands. Tortured and tormented until no bits of his formerself will ever emerge again.For some reason, the last stanza to “The Hanging Tree” starts running through myhead. The one where the man wants his lover dead rather than have her face theevil that awaits her in the world.Are you, are youComing to the treeWear a necklace of rope, side by side with me.Strange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf we met up at midnight in the hanging tree.“I’ll kill you before that happens,” says Gale. “I promise.”Peeta hesitates, as if considering the reliability of this offer, and thenshakes his head. “It’s no good. What if you’re not there to do it? I want one ofthose poison pills like the rest of you have.”Nightlock. There’s one pill back at camp, in its special slot on the sleeve ofmy Mockingjay suit. But there’s another in the breast pocket of my uniform.Interesting that they didn’t issue one to Peeta. Perhaps Coin thought he mighttake it before he had the opportunity to kill me. It’s unclear if Peeta meanshe’d finish himself off now, to spare us having to murder him, or only if theCapitol took him prisoner again. In the state he’s in, I expect it would besooner rather than later. It would certainly make things easier on the rest ofus. Not to have to shoot him. It would certainly simplify the problem of dealingwith his homicidal episodes.I don’t know if it’s the pods, or the fear, or watching Boggs die, but I feelthe arena all around me. It’s as if I’ve never left, really. Once again I’mbattling not only for my own survival but for Peeta’s as well. How satisfying,how entertaining it would be for Snow to have me kill him. To have Peeta’s deathon my conscience for whatever is left of my life.“It’s not about you,” I say. “We’re on a mission. And you’re necessary to it.” Ilook to the rest of the group. “Think we might find some food here?”Besides the medical kit and cameras, we have nothing but our uniforms and ourweapons.Half of us stay to guard Peeta or keep an eye out for Snow’s broadcast, whilethe others hunt for something to eat. Messalla proves most valuable because helived in a near replica of this apartment and knows where people would be mostlikely to stash food. Like how there’s a storage space concealed by a mirroredpanel in the bedroom, or how easy it is to pop out the ventilation screen in thehallway. So even though the kitchen cupboards are bare, we find over thirtycanned goods and several boxes of cookies.The hoarding disgusts the soldiers raised in 13. “Isn’t this illegal?” says Leeg1.“On the contrary, in the Capitol you’d be considered stupid not to do it,” saysMessalla. “Even before the Quarter Quell, people were starting to stock up onscarce supplies.”“While others went without,” says Leeg 1.“Right,” says Messalla. “That’s how it works here.”“Fortunately, or we wouldn’t have dinner,” says Gale. “Everybody grab a can.”Some of our company seem reluctant to do this, but it’s as good a method as any.I’m really not in the mood to divvy up everything into eleven equal parts,factoring in age, body weight, and physical output. I poke around in the pile,about to settle on some cod chowder, when Peeta holds out a can to me. “Here.”I take it, not knowing what to expect. The label reads Lamb Stew.I press my lips together at the memories of rain dripping through stones, myinept attempts at flirting, and the aroma of my favorite Capitol dish in thechilly air. So some part of it must still be in his head, too. How happy, howhungry, how close we were when that picnic basket arrived outside our cave.“Thanks.” I pop open the top. “It even has dried plums.” I bend the lid and useit as a makeshift spoon, scooping a bit into my mouth. Now this place tasteslike the arena, too.We’re passing around a box of fancy cream-filled cookies when the beeping startsagain. The seal of Panem lights up on the screen and remains there while theanthem plays. And then they begin to show images of the dead, just as they didwith the tributes in the arena. They start with the four faces of our TV crew,followed by Boggs, Gale, Finnick, Peeta, and me. Except for Boggs, they don’tbother with the soldiers from 13, either because they have no idea who they areor because they know they won’t mean anything to the audience. Then the manhimself appears, seated at his desk, a flag draped behind him, the fresh whiterose gleaming in his lapel. I think he might have recently had more work done,because his lips are puffier than usual. And his prep team really needs to use alighter hand with his blush.Snow congratulates the Peacekeepers on a masterful job, honors them for riddingthe country of the menace called the Mockingjay. With my death, he predicts aturning of the tide in the war, since the demoralized rebels have no one left tofollow. And what was I, really? A poor, unstable girl with a small talent with abow and arrow. Not a great thinker, not the mastermind of the rebellion, merelya face plucked from the rabble because I had caught the nation’s attention withmy antics in the Games. But necessary, so very necessary, because the rebelshave no real leader among them.Somewhere in District 13, Beetee hits a switch, because now it’s not PresidentSnow but President Coin who’s looking at us. She introduces herself to Panem,identifies herself as the head of the rebellion, and then gives my eulogy.Praise for the girl who survived the Seam and the Hunger Games, then turned acountry of slaves into an army of freedom fighters. “Dead or alive, KatnissEverdeen will remain the face of this rebellion. If ever you waver in yourresolve, think of the Mockingjay, and in her you will find the strength you needto rid Panem of its oppressors.”“I had no idea how much I meant to her,” I say, which brings a laugh from Galeand questioning looks from the others.Up comes a heavily doctored photo of me looking beautiful and fierce with abunch of flames flickering behind me. No words. No slogan. My face is all theyneed now.Beetee gives the reins back to a very controlled Snow. I have the feeling thepresident thought the emergency channel was impenetrable, and someone will endup dead tonight because it was breached. “Tomorrow morning, when we pull KatnissEverdeen’s body from the ashes, we will see exactly who the Mockingjay is. Adead girl who could save no one, not even herself.” Seal, anthem, and out.“Except that you won’t find her,” says Finnick to the empty screen, voicing whatwe’re all probably thinking. The grace period will be brief. Once they digthrough those ashes and come up missing eleven bodies, they’ll know we escaped.“We can get a head start on them at least,” I say. Suddenly, I’m so tired. All Iwant is to lie down on a nearby green plush sofa and go to sleep. To cocoonmyself in a comforter made of rabbit fur and goose down. Instead, I pull out theHolo and insist that Jackson talk me through the most basic commands—which arereally about entering the coordinates of the nearest map grid intersection—sothat I can at least begin to operate the thing myself. As the Holo projects oursurroundings, I feel my heart sink even further. We must be moving closer tocrucial targets, because the number of pods has noticeably increased. How can wepossibly move forward into this bouquet of blinking lights without detection? Wecan’t. And if we can’t, we are trapped like birds in a net. I decide it’s bestnot to adopt some sort of superior attitude when I’m with these people.Especially when my eyes keep drifting to that green sofa. So I say, “Any ideas?”“Why don’t we start by ruling out possibilities,” says Finnick. “The street isnot a possibility.”“The rooftops are just as bad as the street,” says Leeg 1.“We still might have a chance to withdraw, go back the way we came,” says Homes.“But that would mean a failed mission.”A pang of guilt hits me since I’ve fabricated said mission. “It was neverintended for all of us to go forward. You just had the misfortune to be withme.”“Well, that’s a moot point. We’re with you now,” says Jackson. “So, we can’tstay put. We can’t move up. We can’t move laterally. I think that just leavesone option.”“Underground,” says Gale.Underground. Which I hate. Like mines and tunnels and 13. Underground, where Idread dying, which is stupid because even if I die aboveground, the next thingthey’ll do is bury me underground anyway.The Holo can show subterranean as well as street-level pods. I see that when wego underground the clean, dependable lines of the street plan are interlacedwith a twisting, turning mess of tunnels. The pods look less numerous, though.Two doors down, a vertical tube connects our row of apartments to the tunnels.To reach the tube apartment, we will need to squeeze through a maintenance shaftthat runs the length of the building. We can enter the shaft through the back ofa closet space on the upper floor.“Okay, then. Let’s make it look like we’ve never been here,” I say. We erase allsigns of our stay. Send the empty cans down a trash chute, pocket the full onesfor later, flip sofa cushions smeared with blood, wipe traces of gel from thetiles. There’s no fixing the latch on the front door, but we lock a second bolt,which will at least keep the door from swinging open on contact.Finally, there’s only Peeta to contend with. He plants himself on the blue sofa,refusing to budge. “I’m not going. I’ll either disclose your position or hurtsomeone else.”“Snow’s people will find you,” says Finnick.“Then leave me a pill. I’ll only take it if I have to,” says Peeta.“That’s not an option. Come along,” says Jackson.“Or you’ll what? Shoot me?” asks Peeta.“We’ll knock you out and drag you with us,” says Homes. “Which will both slow usdown and endanger us.”“Stop being noble! I don’t care if I die!” He turns to me, pleading now.“Katniss, please. Don’t you see, I want to be out of this?”The trouble is, I do see. Why can’t I just let him go? Slip him a pill, pull thetrigger? Is it because I care too much about Peeta or too much about lettingSnow win? Have I turned him into a piece in my private Games? That’s despicable,but I’m not sure it’s beneath me. If it’s true, it would be kindest to killPeeta here and now. But for better or worse, I am not motivated by kindness.“We’re wasting time. Are you coming voluntarily or do we knock you out?”Peeta buries his face in his hands for a few moments, then rises to join us.“Should we free his hands?” asks Leeg 1.“No!” Peeta growls at her, drawing his cuffs in close to his body.“No,” I echo. “But I want the key.” Jackson passes it over without a word. Islip it into my pants pocket, where it clicks against the pearl.When Homes pries open the small metal door to the maintenance shaft, weencounter another problem. There’s no way the insect shells will be able to fitthrough the narrow passage. Castor and Pollux remove them and detach emergencybackup cameras. Each is the size of a shoe box and probably works about as well.Messalla can’t think of anywhere better to hide the bulky shells, so we end updumping them in the closet. Leaving such an easy trail to follow frustrates me,but what else can we do?Even going single file, holding our packs and gear out to the side, it’s a tightfit. We sidestep our way past the first apartment, and break into the second. Inthis apartment, one of the bedrooms has a door marked utility instead of abathroom. Behind the door is the room with the entrance to the tube.Messalla frowns at the wide circular cover, for a moment returning to his ownfussy world. “It’s why no one ever wants the center unit. Workmen coming andgoing whenever and no second bath. But the rent’s considerably cheaper.” Then henotices Finnick’s amused expression and adds, “Never mind.”The tube cover’s simple to unlatch. A wide ladder with rubber treads on thesteps allows for a swift, easy descent into the bowels of the city. We gather atthe foot of the ladder, waiting for our eyes to adjust to the dim strips oflights, breathing in the mixture of chemicals, mildew, and sewage.Pollux, pale and sweaty, reaches out and latches on to Castor’s wrist. Like hemight fall over if there isn’t someone to steady him.“My brother worked down here after he became an Avox,” says Castor. Of course.Who else would they get to maintain these dank, evil-smelling passages minedwith pods? “Took five years before we were able to buy his way up to groundlevel. Didn’t see the sun once.”Under better conditions, on a day with fewer horrors and more rest, someonewould surely know what to say. Instead we all stand there for a long time tryingto formulate a response.Finally, Peeta turns to Pollux. “Well, then you just became our most valuableasset.” Castor laughs and Pollux manages a smile.We’re halfway down the first tunnel when I realize what was so remarkable aboutthe exchange. Peeta sounded like his old self, the one who could always think ofthe right thing to say when nobody else could. Ironic, encouraging, a littlefunny, but not at anyone’s expense. I glance back at him as he trudges alongunder his guards, Gale and Jackson, his eyes fixed on the ground, his shouldershunched forward. So dispirited. But for a moment, he was really here.Peeta called it right. Pollux turns out to be worth ten Holos. There is a simplenetwork of wide tunnels that directly corresponds to the main street plan above,underlying the major avenues and cross streets. It’s called the Transfer, sincesmall trucks use it to deliver goods around the city. During the day, its manypods are deactivated, but at night it’s a minefield. However, hundreds ofadditional passages, utility shafts, train tracks, and drainage tubes form amultilevel maze. Pollux knows details that would lead to disaster for anewcomer, like which offshoots might require gas masks or have live wires orrats the size of beavers. He alerts us to the gush of water that sweeps throughthe sewers periodically, anticipates the time the Avoxes will be changingshifts, leads us into damp, obscure pipes to dodge the nearly silent passage ofcargo trains. Most important, he has knowledge of the cameras. There aren’t manydown in this gloomy, misty place, except in the Transfer. But we keep well outof their way.Under Pollux’s guidance we make good time—remarkable time, if you compare it toour aboveground travel. After about six hours, fatigue takes over. It’s three inthe morning, so I figure we still have a few hours before our bodies arediscovered missing, they search through the rubble of the whole block ofapartments in case we tried to escape through the shafts, and the hunt begins.When I suggest we rest, no one objects. Pollux finds a small, warm room hummingwith machines loaded with levers and dials. He holds up his fingers to indicatewe must be gone in four hours. Jackson works out a guard schedule, and, sinceI’m not on the first shift, I wedge myself in the tight space between Gale andLeeg 1 and go right to sleep.It seems like only minutes later when Jackson shakes me awake, tells me I’m onwatch. It’s six o’clock, and in one hour we must be on our way. Jackson tells meto eat a can of food and keep an eye on Pollux, who’s insisted on being on guardthe entire night. “He can’t sleep down here.” I drag myself into a state ofrelative alertness, eat a can of potato and bean stew, and sit against the wallfacing the door. Pollux seems wide awake. He’s probably been reliving those fiveyears of imprisonment all night. I get out the Holo and manage to input our gridcoordinates and scan the tunnels. As expected, more pods are registering thecloser we move toward the center of the Capitol. For a while, Pollux and I clickaround on the Holo, seeing what traps lie where. When my head begins to spin, Ihand it over to him and lean back against the wall. I look down at the sleepingsoldiers, crew, and friends, and I wonder how many of us will ever see the sunagain.When my eyes fall on Peeta, whose head rests right by my feet, I see he’s awake.I wish I could read what’s going on in his mind, that I could go in and untanglethe mess of lies. Then I settle for something I can accomplish.“Have you eaten?” I ask. A slight shake of his head indicates he hasn’t. I opena can of chicken and rice soup and hand it to him, keeping the lid in case hetries to slit his wrists with it or something. He sits up and tilts the can,chugging back the soup without really bothering to chew it. The bottom of thecan reflects the lights from the machines, and I remember something that’s beenitching at the back of my mind since yesterday. “Peeta, when you asked aboutwhat happened to Darius and Lavinia, and Boggs told you it was real, you saidyou thought so. Because there was nothing shiny about it. What did you mean?”“Oh. I don’t know exactly how to explain it,” he tells me. “In the beginning,everything was just complete confusion. Now I can sort certain things out. Ithink there’s a pattern emerging. The memories they altered with the trackerjacker venom have this strange quality about them. Like they’re too intense orthe images aren’t stable. You remember what it was like when we were stung?”“Trees shattered. There were giant colored butterflies. I fell in a pit oforange bubbles.” I think about it. “Shiny orange bubbles.”“Right. But nothing about Darius or Lavinia was like that. I don’t think they’dgiven me any venom yet,” he says.“Well, that’s good, isn’t it?” I ask. “If you can separate the two, then you canfigure out what’s true.”“Yes. And if I could grow wings, I could fly. Only people can’t grow wings,” hesays. “Real or not real?”“Real,” I say. “But people don’t need wings to survive.”“Mockingjays do.” He finishes the soup and returns the can to me.In the fluorescent light, the circles under his eyes look like bruises. “There’sstill time. You should sleep.” Unresisting, he lies back down, but just staresat the needle on one of the dials as it twitches from side to side. Slowly, as Iwould with a wounded animal, my hand stretches out and brushes a wave of hairfrom his forehead. He freezes at my touch, but doesn’t recoil. So I continue togently smooth back his hair. It’s the first time I have voluntarily touched himsince the last arena.“You’re still trying to protect me. Real or not real,” he whispers.“Real,” I answer. It seems to require more explanation. “Because that’s what youand I do. Protect each other.” After a minute or so, he drifts off to sleep.Shortly before seven, Pollux and I move among the others, rousing them. Thereare the usual yawns and sighs that accompany waking. But my ears are picking upsomething else, too. Almost like a hissing. Perhaps it’s only steam escaping apipe or the far-off whoosh of one of the trains….I hush the group to get a better read on it. There’s a hissing, yes, but it’snot one extended sound. More like multiple exhalations that form words. A singleword. Echoing throughout the tunnels. One word. One name. Repeated over and overagain.“Katniss.”"},{"pageContent":"22 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_22]The grace period has ended. Perhaps Snow had them digging through the night. Assoon as the fire died down, anyway. They found Boggs’s remains, briefly feltreassured, and then, as the hours went by without further trophies, began tosuspect. At some point, they realized that they had been tricked. And PresidentSnow can’t tolerate being made to look like a fool. It doesn’t matter whetherthey tracked us to the second apartment or assumed we went directly underground.They know we are down here now and they’ve unleashed something, a pack of muttsprobably, bent on finding me.“Katniss.” I jump at the proximity of the sound. Look frantically for itssource, bow loaded, seeking a target to hit. “Katniss.” Peeta’s lips are barelymoving, but there’s no doubt, the name came out of him. Just when I thought heseemed a little better, when I thought he might be inching his way back to me,here is proof of how deep Snow’s poison went. “Katniss.” Peeta’s programmed torespond to the hissing chorus, to join in the hunt. He’s beginning to stir.There’s no choice. I position my arrow to penetrate his brain. He’ll barely feela thing. Suddenly, he’s sitting up, eyes wide in alarm, short of breath.“Katniss!” He whips his head toward me but doesn’t seem to notice my bow, thewaiting arrow. “Katniss! Get out of here!”I hesitate. His voice is alarmed, but not insane. “Why? What’s making thatsound?”“I don’t know. Only that it has to kill you,” says Peeta. “Run! Get out! Go!”After my own moment of confusion, I conclude I do not have to shoot him. Relaxmy bowstring. Take in the anxious faces around me. “Whatever it is, it’s afterme. It might be a good time to split up.”“But we’re your guard,” says Jackson.“And your crew,” adds Cressida.“I’m not leaving you,” Gale says.I look at the crew, armed with nothing but cameras and clipboards. And there’sFinnick with two guns and a trident. I suggest that he give one of his guns toCastor. Eject the blank cartridge from Peeta’s, load it with a real one, and armPollux. Since Gale and I have our bows, we hand our guns over to Messalla andCressida. There’s no time to show them anything but how to point and pull thetrigger, but in close quarters, that might be enough. It’s better than beingdefenseless. Now the only one without a weapon is Peeta, but anyone whisperingmy name with a bunch of mutts doesn’t need one anyway.We leave the room free of everything but our scent. There’s no way to erase thatat the moment. I’m guessing that’s how the hissing things are tracking us,because we haven’t left much of a physical trail. The mutts’ noses will beabnormally keen, but possibly the time we spent slogging through water indrainpipes will help throw them.Outside the hum of the room, the hissing becomes more distinct. But it’s alsopossible to get a better sense of the mutts’ location. They’re behind us, stilla fair distance. Snow probably had them released underground near the placewhere he found Boggs’s body. Theoretically, we should have a good lead on them,although they’re certain to be much faster than we are. My mind wanders to thewolflike creatures in the first arena, the monkeys in the Quarter Quell, themonstrosities I’ve witnessed on television over the years, and I wonder whatform these mutts will take. Whatever Snow thinks will scare me the most.Pollux and I have worked out a plan for the next leg of our journey, and sinceit heads away from the hissing, I see no reason to alter it. If we move swiftly,maybe we can reach Snow’s mansion before the mutts reach us. But there’s asloppiness that comes with speed: the poorly placed boot that results in asplash, the accidental clang of a gun against a pipe, even my own commands,issued too loudly for discretion.We’ve covered about three more blocks via an overflow pipe and a section ofneglected train track when the screams begin. Thick, guttural. Bouncing off thetunnel walls.“Avoxes,” says Peeta immediately. “That’s what Darius sounded like when theytortured him.”“The mutts must have found them,” says Cressida.“So they’re not just after Katniss,” says Leeg 1.“They’ll probably kill anyone. It’s just that they won’t stop until they get toher,” says Gale. After his hours studying with Beetee, he is most likely right.And here I am again. With people dying because of me. Friends, allies, completestrangers, losing their lives for the Mockingjay. “Let me go on alone. Lead themoff. I’ll transfer the Holo to Jackson. The rest of you can finish the mission.”“No one’s going to agree to that!” says Jackson in exasperation.“We’re wasting time!” says Finnick.“Listen,” Peeta whispers.The screams have stopped, and in their absence my name has rebounded, startlingin its proximity. It’s below as well as behind us now. “Katniss.”I nudge Pollux on the shoulder and we start to run. Trouble is, we had plannedto descend to a lower level, but that’s out now. When we come to the stepsleading down, Pollux and I are scanning for a possible alternative on the Holowhen I start gagging.“Masks on!” orders Jackson.There’s no need for masks. Everyone is breathing the same air. I’m the only onelosing my stew because I’m the only one reacting to the odor. Drifting up fromthe stairwell. Cutting through the sewage. Roses. I begin to tremble.I swerve away from the smell and stumble right out onto the Transfer. Smooth,pastel-colored tiled streets, just like the ones above, but bordered by whitebrick walls instead of homes. A roadway where delivery vehicles can drive withease, without the congestion of the Capitol. Empty now, of everything but us. Iswing up my bow and blow up the first pod with an explosive arrow, which killsthe nest of flesh-eating rats inside. Then I sprint for the next intersection,where I know one false step will cause the ground beneath our feet todisintegrate, feeding us into something labeled Meat Grinder. I shout a warningto the others to stay with me. I plan for us to skirt around the corner and thendetonate the Meat Grinder, but another unmarked pod lies in wait.It happens silently. I would miss it entirely if Finnick didn’t pull me to astop. “Katniss!”I whip back around, arrow poised for flight, but what can be done? Two of Gale’sarrows already lie useless beside the wide shaft of golden light that radiatesfrom ceiling to floor. Inside, Messalla is as still as a statue, poised up onthe ball of one foot, head tilted back, held captive by the beam. I can’t tellif he’s yelling, although his mouth is stretched wide. We watch, utterlyhelpless, as the flesh melts off his body like candle wax.“Can’t help him!” Peeta starts shoving people forward. “Can’t!” Amazingly, he’sthe only one still functional enough to get us moving. I don’t know why he’s incontrol, when he should be flipping out and bashing my brains in, but that couldhappen any second. At the pressure of his hand against my shoulder, I turn awayfrom the grisly thing that was Messalla; I make my feet go forward, fast, sofast that I can barely skid to a stop before the next intersection.A spray of gunfire brings down a shower of plaster. I jerk my head from side toside, looking for the pod, before I turn and see the squad of Peacekeeperspounding down the Transfer toward us. With the Meat Grinder pod blocking ourway, there’s nothing to do but fire back. They outnumber us two to one, butwe’ve still got six original members of the Star Squad, who aren’t trying to runand shoot at the same time.Fish in a barrel, I think, as blossoms of red stain their white uniforms.Three-quarters of them are down and dead when more begin to pour in from theside of the tunnel, the same one I flung myself through to get away from thesmell, from the—Those aren’t Peacekeepers.They are white, four-limbed, about the size of a full-grown human, but that’swhere the comparisons stop. Naked, with long reptilian tails, arched backs, andheads that jut forward. They swarm over the Peacekeepers, living and dead, clampon to their necks with their mouths and rip off the helmeted heads. Apparently,having a Capitol pedigree is as useless here as it was in 13. It seems to takeonly seconds before the Peacekeepers are decapitated. The mutts fall to theirbellies and skitter toward us on all fours.“This way!” I shout, hugging the wall and making a sharp right turn to avoid thepod. When everyone’s joined me, I fire into the intersection, and the MeatGrinder activates. Huge mechanical teeth burst through the street and chew thetile to dust. That should make it impossible for the mutts to follow us, but Idon’t know. The wolf and monkey mutts I’ve encountered could leap unbelievablyfar.The hissing burns my ears, and the reek of roses makes the walls spin.I grab Pollux’s arm. “Forget the mission. What’s the quickest way aboveground?”There’s no time for checking the Holo. We follow Pollux for about ten yardsalong the Transfer and go through a doorway. I’m aware of tile changing toconcrete, of crawling through a tight, stinking pipe onto a ledge about a footwide. We’re in the main sewer. A yard below, a poisonous brew of human waste,garbage, and chemical runoff bubbles by us. Parts of the surface are on fire,others emit evil-looking clouds of vapor. One look tells you that if you fallin, you’re never coming out. Moving as quickly as we dare on the slippery ledge,we make our way to a narrow bridge and cross it. In an alcove at the far side,Pollux smacks a ladder with his hand and points up the shaft. This is it. Ourway out.A quick glance at our party tells me something’s off. “Wait! Where are Jacksonand Leeg One?”“They stayed at the Grinder to hold the mutts back,” says Homes.“What?” I’m lunging back for the bridge, willing to leave no one to thosemonsters, when he yanks me back.“Don’t waste their lives, Katniss. It’s too late for them. Look!” Homes nods tothe pipe, where the mutts are slithering onto the ledge.“Stand back!” Gale shouts. With his explosive-tipped arrows, he rips the farside of the bridge from its foundation. The rest sinks into the bubbles, just asthe mutts reach it.For the first time, I get a good look at them. A mix of human and lizard and whoknows what else. White, tight reptilian skin smeared with gore, clawed hands andfeet, their faces a mess of conflicting features. Hissing, shrieking my namenow, as their bodies contort in rage. Lashing out with tails and claws, takinghuge chunks of one another or their own bodies with wide, lathered mouths,driven mad by their need to destroy me. My scent must be as evocative to them astheirs is to me. More so, because despite its toxicity, the mutts begin to throwthemselves into the foul sewer.Along our bank, everyone opens fire. I choose my arrows without discretion,sending arrowheads, fire, explosives into the mutts’ bodies. They’re mortal, butonly just. No natural thing could keep coming with two dozen bullets in it. Yes,we can eventually kill them, only there are so many, an endless supply pouringfrom the pipe, not even hesitating to take to the sewage.But it’s not their numbers that make my hands shake so.No mutt is good. All are meant to damage you. Some take your life, like themonkeys. Others your reason, like the tracker jackers. However, the trueatrocities, the most frightening, incorporate a perverse psychological twistdesigned to terrify the victim. The sight of the wolf mutts with the deadtributes’ eyes. The sound of the jabberjays replicating Prim’s tortured screams.The smell of Snow’s roses mixed with the victims’ blood. Carried across thesewer. Cutting through even this foulness. Making my heart run wild, my skinturn to ice, my lungs unable to suck air. It’s as if Snow’s breathing right inmy face, telling me it’s time to die.The others are shouting at me, but I can’t seem to respond. Strong arms lift meas I blast the head off a mutt whose claws have just grazed my ankle. I’mslammed into the ladder. Hands shoved against the rungs. Ordered to climb. Mywooden, puppet limbs obey. Movement slowly brings me back to my senses. I detectone person above me. Pollux. Peeta and Cressida are below. We reach a platform.Switch to a second ladder. Rungs slick with sweat and mildew. At the nextplatform, my head has cleared and the reality of what’s happened hits me. Ibegin frantically pulling people up off the ladder. Peeta. Cressida. That’s it.What have I done? What have I abandoned the others to? I’m scrambling back downthe ladder when one of my boots kicks someone.“Climb!” Gale barks at me. I’m back up, hauling him in, peering into the gloomfor more. “No.” Gale turns my face to him and shakes his head. Uniform shredded.Gaping wound in the side of his neck.There’s a human cry from below. “Someone’s still alive,” I plead.“No, Katniss. They’re not coming,” says Gale. “Only the mutts are.”Unable to accept it, I shine the light from Cressida’s gun down the shaft. Farbelow, I can just make out Finnick, struggling to hang on as three mutts tear athim. As one yanks back his head to take the death bite, something bizarrehappens. It’s as if I’m Finnick, watching images of my life flash by. The mastof a boat, a silver parachute, Mags laughing, a pink sky, Beetee’s trident,Annie in her wedding dress, waves breaking over rocks. Then it’s over.I slide the Holo from my belt and choke out “nightlock, nightlock, nightlock.”Release it. Hunch against the wall with the others as the explosion rocks theplatform and bits of mutt and human flesh shoot out of the pipe and shower us.There’s a clank as Pollux slams a cover over the pipe and locks it in place.Pollux, Gale, Cressida, Peeta, and me. We’re all that’s left. Later, the humanfeelings will come. Now I’m conscious only of an animal need to keep theremnants of our band alive. “We can’t stop here.”Someone comes up with a bandage. We tie it around Gale’s neck. Get him to hisfeet. Only one figure stays huddled against the wall. “Peeta,” I say. There’s noresponse. Has he blacked out? I crouch in front of him, pulling his cuffed handsfrom his face. “Peeta?” His eyes are like black pools, the pupils dilated sothat the blue irises have all but vanished. The muscles in his wrists are hardas metal.“Leave me,” he whispers. “I can’t hang on.”“Yes. You can!” I tell him.Peeta shakes his head. “I’m losing it. I’ll go mad. Like them.”Like the mutts. Like a rabid beast bent on ripping my throat out. And here,finally here in this place, in these circumstances, I will really have to killhim. And Snow will win. Hot, bitter hatred courses through me. Snow has won toomuch already today.It’s a long shot, it’s suicide maybe, but I do the only thing I can think of. Ilean in and kiss Peeta full on the mouth. His whole body starts shuddering, butI keep my lips pressed to his until I have to come up for air. My hands slide uphis wrists to clasp his. “Don’t let him take you from me.”Peeta’s panting hard as he fights the nightmares raging in his head. “No. Idon’t want to…”I clench his hands to the point of pain. “Stay with me.”His pupils contract to pinpoints, dilate again rapidly, and then return tosomething resembling normalcy. “Always,” he murmurs.I help Peeta up and address Pollux. “How far to the street?” He indicates it’sjust above us. I climb the last ladder and push open the lid to someone’sutility room. I’m rising to my feet when a woman throws open the door. She wearsa bright turquoise silk robe embroidered with exotic birds. Her magenta hair’sfluffed up like a cloud and decorated with gilded butterflies. Grease from thehalf-eaten sausage she’s holding smears her lipstick. The expression on her facesays she recognizes me. She opens her mouth to call for help.Without hesitation, I shoot her through the heart."},{"pageContent":"23 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_23]Who the woman was calling to remains a mystery, because after searching theapartment, we find she was alone. Perhaps her cry was meant for a nearbyneighbor, or was simply an expression of fear. At any rate, there’s no one elseto hear her.This apartment would be a classy place to hole up in for a while, but that’s aluxury we can’t afford. “How long do you think we have before they figure outsome of us could’ve survived?” I ask.“I think they could be here anytime,” Gale answers. “They knew we were headingfor the streets. Probably the explosion will throw them for a few minutes, thenthey’ll start looking for our exit point.”I go to a window that overlooks the street, and when I peek through the blinds,I’m not faced with Peacekeepers but with a bundled crowd of people going abouttheir business. During our underground journey, we have left the evacuated zonesfar behind and surfaced in a busy section of the Capitol. This crowd offers ouronly chance of escape. I don’t have a Holo, but I have Cressida. She joins me atthe window, confirms she knows our location, and gives me the good news that wearen’t many blocks from the president’s mansion.One glance at my companions tells me this is no time for a stealth attack onSnow. Gale’s still losing blood from the neck wound, which we haven’t evencleaned. Peeta’s sitting on a velvet sofa with his teeth clamped down on apillow, either fighting off madness or containing a scream. Pollux weeps againstthe mantel of an ornate fireplace. Cressida stands determinedly at my side, butshe’s so pale her lips are bloodless. I’m running on hate. When the energy forthat ebbs, I’ll be worthless.“Let’s check her closets,” I say.In one bedroom we find hundreds of the woman’s outfits, coats, pairs of shoes, arainbow of wigs, enough makeup to paint a house. In a bedroom across the hall,there’s a similar selection for men. Perhaps they belong to her husband. Perhapsto a lover who had the good luck to be out this morning.I call the others to dress. At the sight of Peeta’s bloody wrists, I dig in mypocket for the handcuff key, but he jerks away from me.“No,” he says. “Don’t. They help hold me together.”“You might need your hands,” says Gale.“When I feel myself slipping, I dig my wrists into them, and the pain helps mefocus,” says Peeta. I let them be.Fortunately, it’s cold out, so we can conceal most of our uniforms and weaponsunder flowing coats and cloaks. We hang our boots around our necks by theirlaces and hide them, pull on silly shoes to replace them. The real challenge, ofcourse, is our faces. Cressida and Pollux run the risk of being recognized byacquaintances, Gale could be familiar from the propos and news, and Peeta and Iare known by every citizen of Panem. We hastily help one another apply thicklayers of makeup, pull on wigs and sunglasses. Cressida wraps scarves overPeeta’s and my mouths and noses.I can feel the clock ticking away, but stop for just a few moments to stuffpockets with food and first-aid supplies. “Stay together,” I say at the frontdoor. Then we march right into the street. Snow flurries have begun to fall.Agitated people swirl around us, speaking of rebels and hunger and me in theiraffected Capitol accents. We cross the street, pass a few more apartments. Justas we turn the corner, three dozen Peacekeepers sweep past us. We hop out oftheir way, as the real citizens do, wait until the crowd returns to its normalflow, and keep moving. “Cressida,” I whisper. “Can you think of anywhere?”“I’m trying,” she says.We cover another block, and the sirens begin. Through an apartment window, I seean emergency report and pictures of our faces flashing. They haven’t identifiedwho in our party died yet, because I see Castor and Finnick among the photos.Soon every passerby will be as dangerous as a Peacekeeper. “Cressida?”“There’s one place. It’s not ideal. But we can try it,” she says. We follow hera few more blocks and turn through a gate into what looks like a privateresidence. It’s some kind of shortcut, though, because after walking through amanicured garden, we come out of another gate onto a small back street thatconnects two main avenues. There are a few poky stores—one that buys used goods,another that sells fake jewelry. Only a couple of people are around, and theypay no attention to us. Cressida begins to babble in a high-pitched voice aboutfur undergarments, how essential they are during the cold months. “Wait untilyou see the prices! Believe me, it’s half what you pay on the avenues!”We stop before a grimy storefront filled with mannequins in furry underwear. Theplace doesn’t even look open, but Cressida pushes through the front door,setting off a dissonant chiming. Inside the dim, narrow shop lined with racks ofmerchandise, the smell of pelts fills my nose. Business must be slow, sincewe’re the only customers. Cressida heads straight for a hunched figure sittingin the back. I follow, trailing my fingers through the soft garments as we go.Behind a counter sits the strangest person I’ve ever seen. She’s an extremeexample of surgical enhancement gone wrong, for surely not even in the Capitolcould they find this face attractive. The skin has been pulled back tightly andtattooed with black and gold stripes. The nose has been flattened until itbarely exists. I’ve seen cat whiskers on people in the Capitol before, but noneso long. The result is a grotesque, semi-feline mask, which now squints at usdistrustfully.Cressida takes off her wig, revealing her vines. “Tigris,” she says. “We needhelp.”Tigris. Deep in my brain, the name rings a bell. She was a fixture—a younger,less disturbing version of herself—in the earliest Hunger Games I can remember.A stylist, I think. I don’t remember for which district. Not 12. Then she musthave had one operation too many and crossed the line into repellence.So this is where stylists go when they’ve outlived their use. To sad themeunderwear shops where they wait for death. Out of the public eye.I stare at her face, wondering if her parents actually named her Tigris,inspiring her mutilation, or if she chose the style and changed her name tomatch her stripes.“Plutarch said you could be trusted,” adds Cressida.Great, she’s one of Plutarch’s people. So if her first move isn’t to turn us into the Capitol, it will be to notify Plutarch, and by extension Coin, of ourwhereabouts. No, Tigris’s shop is not ideal, but it’s all we have at the moment.If she’ll even help us. She’s peering between an old television on her counterand us, as if trying to place us. To help her, I pull down my scarf, remove mywig, and step closer so that the light of the screen falls on my face.Tigris gives a low growl, not unlike one Buttercup might greet me with. Sheslinks down off her stool and disappears behind a rack of fur-lined leggings.There’s a sound of sliding, and then her hand emerges and waves us forward.Cressida looks at me, as if to ask Are you sure? But what choice do we have?Returning to the streets under these conditions guarantees our capture or death.I push around the furs and find Tigris has slid back a panel at the base of thewall. Behind it seems to be the top of a steep stone stairway. She gestures forme to enter.Everything about the situation screams trap. I have a moment of panic and findmyself turning to Tigris, searching those tawny eyes. Why is she doing this?She’s no Cinna, someone willing to sacrifice herself for others. This woman wasthe embodiment of Capitol shallowness. She was one of the stars of the HungerGames until…until she wasn’t. So is that it, then? Bitterness? Hatred? Revenge?Actually, I’m comforted by the idea. A need for revenge can burn long and hot.Especially if every glance in a mirror reinforces it.“Did Snow ban you from the Games?” I ask. She just stares back at me. Somewhereher tiger tail flicks with displeasure. “Because I’m going to kill him, youknow.” Her mouth spreads into what I take for a smile. Reassured that this isn’tcomplete madness, I crawl through the space.About halfway down the steps, my face runs into a hanging chain and I pull it,illuminating the hideout with a flickering fluorescent bulb. It’s a small cellarwith no doors or windows. Shallow and wide. Probably just a strip between tworeal basements. A place whose existence could go unnoticed unless you had a verykeen eye for dimensions. It’s cold and dank, with piles of pelts that I’mguessing haven’t seen the light of day in years. Unless Tigris gives us up, Idon’t believe anyone will find us here. By the time I reach the concrete floor,my companions are on the steps. The panel slides back in place. I hear theunderwear rack being adjusted on squeaky wheels. Tigris padding back to herstool. We have been swallowed up by her store.Just in time, too, because Gale looks on the verge of collapse. We make a bed ofpelts, strip off his layers of weapons, and help him onto his back. At the endof the cellar, there’s a faucet about a foot from the floor with a drain underit. I turn the tap and, after much sputtering and a lot of rust, clear waterbegins to flow. We clean Gale’s neck wound and I realize bandages won’t beenough. He’s going to need a few stitches. There’s a needle and sterile threadin the first-aid supplies, but what we lack is a healer. It crosses my mind toenlist Tigris. As a stylist, she must know how to work a needle. But that wouldleave no one manning the shop, and she’s doing enough already. I accept that I’mprobably the most qualified for the job, grit my teeth, and put in a row ofjagged sutures. It’s not pretty but it’s functional. I smear it with medicineand wrap it up. Give him some painkillers. “You can rest now. It’s safe here,” Itell him. He goes out like a light.While Cressida and Pollux make fur nests for each of us, I attend to Peeta’swrists. Gently rinsing away the blood, putting on an antiseptic, and bandagingthem beneath the cuffs. “You’ve got to keep them clean, otherwise the infectioncould spread and—”“I know what blood poisoning is, Katniss,” says Peeta. “Even if my mother isn’ta healer.”I’m jolted back in time, to another wound, another set of bandages. “You saidthat same thing to me in the first Hunger Games. Real or not real?”“Real,” he says. “And you risked your life getting the medicine that saved me?”“Real.” I shrug. “You were the reason I was alive to do it.”“Was I?” The comment throws him into confusion. Some shiny memory must befighting for his attention, because his body tenses and his newly bandagedwrists strain against the metal cuffs. Then all the energy saps from his body.“I’m so tired, Katniss.”“Go to sleep,” I say. He won’t until I’ve rearranged his handcuffs and shackledhim to one of the stair supports. It can’t be comfortable, lying there with hisarms above his head. But in a few minutes, he drifts off, too.Cressida and Pollux have made beds for us, arranged our food and medicalsupplies, and now ask what I want to do about setting up a guard. I look atGale’s pallor, Peeta’s restraints. Pollux hasn’t slept for days, and Cressidaand I only napped for a few hours. If a troop of Peacekeepers were to comethrough that door, we’d be trapped like rats. We are completely at the mercy ofa decrepit tiger-woman with what I can only hope is an all-consuming passion forSnow’s death.“I don’t honestly think there’s any point in setting up a guard. Let’s just tryto get some sleep,” I say. They nod numbly, and we all burrow into our pelts.The fire inside me has flickered out, and with it my strength. I surrender tothe soft, musty fur and oblivion.I have only one dream I remember. A long and wearying thing in which I’m tryingto get to District 12. The home I’m seeking is intact, the people alive. EffieTrinket, conspicuous in a bright pink wig and tailored outfit, travels with me.I keep trying to ditch her in places, but she inexplicably reappears at my side,insisting that as my escort she’s responsible for my staying on schedule. Onlythe schedule is constantly shifting, derailed by our lack of a stamp from anofficial or delayed when Effie breaks one of her high heels. We camp for days ona bench in a gray station in District 7, awaiting a train that never comes. WhenI wake, somehow I feel even more drained by this than my usual nighttime foraysinto blood and terror.Cressida, the only person awake, tells me it’s late afternoon. I eat a can ofbeef stew and wash it down with a lot of water. Then I lean against the cellarwall, retracing the events of the last day. Moving death by death. Counting themup on my fingers. One, two—Mitchell and Boggs lost on the block. Three—Messallamelted by the pod. Four, five—Leeg 1 and Jackson sacrificing themselves at theMeat Grinder. Six, seven, eight—Castor, Homes, and Finnick being decapitated bythe rose-scented lizard mutts. Eight dead in twenty-four hours. I know ithappened, and yet it doesn’t seem real. Surely, Castor is asleep under that pileof furs, Finnick will come bounding down the steps in a minute, Boggs will tellme his plan for our escape.To believe them dead is to accept I killed them. Okay, maybe not Mitchell andBoggs—they died on an actual assignment. But the others lost their livesdefending me on a mission I fabricated. My plot to assassinate Snow seems sostupid now. So stupid as I sit shivering here in this cellar, tallying up ourlosses, fingering the tassels on the silver knee-high boots I stole from thewoman’s home. Oh, yeah—I forgot about that. I killed her, too. I’m taking outunarmed citizens now.I think it’s time I give myself up.When everyone finally awakens, I confess. How I lied about the mission, how Ijeopardized everyone in pursuit of revenge. There’s a long silence after Ifinish. Then Gale says, “Katniss, we all knew you were lying about Coin sendingyou to assassinate Snow.”“You knew, maybe. The soldiers from Thirteen didn’t,” I reply.“Do you really think Jackson believed you had orders from Coin?” Cressida asks.“Of course she didn’t. But she trusted Boggs, and he’d clearly wanted you to goon.”“I never even told Boggs what I planned to do,” I say.“You told everyone in Command!” Gale says. “It was one of your conditions forbeing the Mockingjay. ‘I kill Snow.’”Those seem like two disconnected things. Negotiating with Coin for the privilegeof executing Snow after the war and this unauthorized flight through theCapitol. “But not like this,” I say. “It’s been a complete disaster.”“I think it would be considered a highly successful mission,” says Gale. “We’veinfiltrated the enemy camp, showing that the Capitol’s defenses can be breached.We’ve managed to get footage of ourselves all over the Capitol’s news. We’vethrown the whole city into chaos trying to find us.”“Trust me, Plutarch’s thrilled,” Cressida adds.“That’s because Plutarch doesn’t care who dies,” I say. “Not as long as hisGames are a success.”Cressida and Gale go round and round trying to convince me. Pollux nods at theirwords to back them up. Only Peeta doesn’t offer an opinion.“What do you think, Peeta?” I finally ask him.“I think…you still have no idea. The effect you can have.” He slides his cuffsup the support and pushes himself to a sitting position. “None of the people welost were idiots. They knew what they were doing. They followed you because theybelieved you really could kill Snow.”I don’t know why his voice reaches me when no one else’s can. But if he’s right,and I think he is, I owe the others a debt that can only be repaid in one way. Ipull my paper map from a pocket in my uniform and spread it out on the floorwith new resolve. “Where are we, Cressida?”Tigris’s shop sits about five blocks from the City Circle and Snow’s mansion.We’re in easy walking distance through a zone in which the pods are deactivatedfor the residents’ safety. We have disguises that, perhaps with someembellishments from Tigris’s furry stock, could get us safely there. But thenwhat? The mansion’s sure to be heavily guarded, under round-the-clock camerasurveillance, and laced with pods that could become live at the flick of aswitch.“What we need is to get him out in the open,” Gale says to me. “Then one of uscould pick him off.”“Does he ever appear in public anymore?” asks Peeta.“I don’t think so,” says Cressida. “At least in all the recent speeches I’veseen, he’s been in the mansion. Even before the rebels got here. I imagine hebecame more vigilant after Finnick aired his crimes.”That’s right. It’s not just the Tigrises of the Capitol who hate Snow now, but aweb of people who know what he did to their friends and families. It would haveto be something bordering on miraculous to lure him out. Something like…“I bet he’d come out for me,” I say. “If I were captured. He’d want that aspublic as possible. He’d want my execution on his front steps.” I let this sinkin. “Then Gale could shoot him from the audience.”“No.” Peeta shakes his head. “There are too many alternative endings to thatplan. Snow might decide to keep you and torture information out of you. Or haveyou executed publicly without being present. Or kill you inside the mansion anddisplay your body out front.”“Gale?” I say.“It seems like an extreme solution to jump to immediately,” he says. “Maybe ifall else fails. Let’s keep thinking.”In the quiet that follows, we hear Tigris’s soft footfall overhead. It must beclosing time. She’s locking up, fastening the shutters maybe. A few minuteslater, the panel at the top of the stairs slides open.“Come up,” says a gravelly voice. “I have some food for you.” It’s the firsttime she’s talked since we arrived. Whether it’s natural or from years ofpractice, I don’t know, but there’s something in her manner of speaking thatsuggests a cat’s purr.As we climb the stairs, Cressida asks, “Did you contact Plutarch, Tigris?”“No way to.” Tigris shrugs. “He’ll figure out you’re in a safe house. Don’tworry.”Worry? I feel immensely relieved by the news that I won’t be given—and have toignore—direct orders from 13. Or make up some viable defense for the decisionsI’ve made over the last couple of days.In the shop, the counter holds some stale hunks of bread, a wedge of moldycheese, and half a bottle of mustard. It reminds me that not everyone in theCapitol has full stomachs these days. I feel obliged to tell Tigris about ourremaining food supplies, but she waves my objections away. “I eat next tonothing,” she says. “And then, only raw meat.” This seems a little too incharacter, but I don’t question it. I just scrape the mold off the cheese anddivide up the food among the rest of us.While we eat, we watch the latest Capitol news coverage. The government has therebel survivors narrowed down to the five of us. Huge bounties are offered forinformation leading to our capture. They emphasize how dangerous we are. Show usexchanging gunfire with the Peacekeepers, although not the mutts ripping offtheir heads. Do a tragic tribute to the woman lying where we left her, with myarrow still in her heart. Someone has redone her makeup for the cameras.The rebels let the Capitol broadcast run on uninterrupted. “Have the rebels madea statement today?” I ask Tigris. She shakes her head. “I doubt Coin knows whatto do with me now that I’m still alive.”Tigris gives a throaty cackle. “No one knows what to do with you, girlie.” Thenshe makes me take a pair of the fur leggings even though I can’t pay her forthem. It’s the kind of gift you have to accept. And anyway, it’s cold in thatcellar.Downstairs after supper, we continue to rack our brains for a plan. Nothing goodcomes up, but we do agree that we can no longer go out as a group of five andthat we should try to infiltrate the president’s mansion before I turn myselfinto bait. I consent to that second point to avoid further argument. If I dodecide to give myself up, it won’t require anyone else’s permission orparticipation.We change bandages, handcuff Peeta back to his support, and settle down tosleep. A few hours later, I slip back into consciousness and become aware of aquiet conversation. Peeta and Gale. I can’t stop myself from eavesdropping.“Thanks for the water,” Peeta says.“No problem,” Gale replies. “I wake up ten times a night anyway.”“To make sure Katniss is still here?” asks Peeta.“Something like that,” Gale admits.There’s a long pause before Peeta speaks again. “That was funny, what Tigrissaid. About no one knowing what to do with her.”“Well, we never have,” Gale says.They both laugh. It’s so strange to hear them talking like this. Almost likefriends. Which they’re not. Never have been. Although they’re not exactlyenemies.“She loves you, you know,” says Peeta. “She as good as told me after theywhipped you.”“Don’t believe it,” Gale answers. “The way she kissed you in the QuarterQuell…well, she never kissed me like that.”“It was just part of the show,” Peeta tells him, although there’s an edge ofdoubt in his voice.“No, you won her over. Gave up everything for her. Maybe that’s the only way toconvince her you love her.” There’s a long pause. “I should have volunteered totake your place in the first Games. Protected her then.”“You couldn’t,” says Peeta. “She’d never have forgiven you. You had to take careof her family. They matter more to her than her life.”“Well, it won’t be an issue much longer. I think it’s unlikely all three of uswill be alive at the end of the war. And if we are, I guess it’s Katniss’sproblem. Who to choose.” Gale yawns. “We should get some sleep.”“Yeah.” I hear Peeta’s handcuffs slide down the support as he settles in. “Iwonder how she’ll make up her mind.”“Oh, that I do know.” I can just catch Gale’s last words through the layer offur. “Katniss will pick whoever she thinks she can’t survive without.”"},{"pageContent":"24 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_24]A chill runs through me. Am I really that cold and calculating? Gale didn’t say,“Katniss will pick whoever it will break her heart to give up,” or even “whoevershe can’t live without.” Those would have implied I was motivated by a kind ofpassion. But my best friend predicts I will choose the person who I think I“can’t survive without.” There’s not the least indication that love, or desire,or even compatibility will sway me. I’ll just conduct an unfeeling assessment ofwhat my potential mates can offer me. As if in the end, it will be the questionof whether a baker or a hunter will extend my longevity the most. It’s ahorrible thing for Gale to say, for Peeta not to refute. Especially when everyemotion I have has been taken and exploited by the Capitol or the rebels. At themoment, the choice would be simple. I can survive just fine without either ofthem.In the morning, I have no time or energy to nurse wounded feelings. During apredawn breakfast of liver pâté and fig cookies, we gather around Tigris’stelevision for one of Beetee’s break-ins. There’s been a new development in thewar. Apparently inspired by the black wave, some enterprising rebel commandercame up with the idea of confiscating people’s abandoned automobiles and sendingthem unmanned down the streets. The cars don’t trigger every pod, but theycertainly get the majority. At around four in the morning, the rebels begancarving three separate paths—simply referred to as the A, B, and C lines—to theCapitol’s heart. As a result, they’ve secured block after block with very fewcasualties.“This can’t last,” says Gale. “In fact I’m surprised they’ve kept it going solong. The Capitol will adjust by deactivating specific pods and then manuallytriggering them when their targets come in range.” Almost within minutes of hisprediction, we see this very thing happen on-screen. A squad sends a car down ablock, setting off four pods. All seems well. Three scouts follow and make itsafely to the end of the street. But when a group of twenty rebel soldiersfollow them, they’re blown to bits by a row of potted rosebushes in front of aflower shop.“I bet it’s killing Plutarch not to be in the control room on this one,” saysPeeta.Beetee gives the broadcast back to the Capitol, where a grim-faced reporterannounces the blocks that civilians are to evacuate. Between her update and theprevious story, I am able to mark my paper map to show the relative positions ofthe opposing armies.I hear scuffling out on the street, move to the windows, and peek out a crack inthe shutters. In the early morning light, I see a bizarre spectacle. Refugeesfrom the now occupied blocks are streaming toward the Capitol’s center. The mostpanicked are wearing nothing but nightgowns and slippers, while the moreprepared are heavily bundled in layers of clothes. They carry everything fromlapdogs to jewelry boxes to potted plants. One man in a fluffy robe holds onlyan overripe banana. Confused, sleepy children stumble along after their parents,most either too stunned or too baffled to cry. Bits of them flash by my line ofvision. A pair of wide brown eyes. An arm clutching a favorite doll. A pair ofbare feet, bluish in the cold, catching on the uneven paving stones of thealley. Seeing them reminds me of the children of 12 who died fleeing thefirebombs. I leave the window.Tigris offers to be our spy for the day since she’s the only one of us without abounty on her head. After securing us downstairs, she goes out into the Capitolto pick up any helpful information.Down in the cellar I pace back and forth, driving the others crazy. Somethingtells me that not taking advantage of the flood of refugees is a mistake. Whatbetter cover could we have? On the other hand, every displaced person millingabout on the streets means another pair of eyes looking for the five rebels onthe loose. Then again, what do we gain by staying here? All we’re really doingis depleting our small cache of food and waiting for…what? The rebels to takethe Capitol? It could be weeks before that happens, and I’m not so sure what I’ddo if they did. Not run out and greet them. Coin would have me whisked back to13 before I could say “nightlock, nightlock, nightlock.” I did not come all thisway, and lose all those people, to turn myself over to that woman. I kill Snow.Besides, there would be an awful lot of things I couldn’t easily explain aboutthe last few days. Several of which, if they came to light, would probably blowmy deal for the victors’ immunity right out of the water. And forget about me,I’ve got a feeling some of the others are going to need it. Like Peeta. Who, nomatter how you spin it, can be seen on tape tossing Mitchell into that net pod.I can imagine what Coin’s war tribunal will do with that.By late afternoon, we’re beginning to get uneasy about Tigris’s long absence.Talk turns to the possibilities that she has been apprehended and arrested,turned us in voluntarily, or simply been injured in the wave of refugees. Butaround six o’clock we hear her return. There’s some shuffling around upstairs,then she opens the panel. The wonderful smell of frying meat fills the air.Tigris has prepared us a hash of chopped ham and potatoes. It’s the first hotfood we’ve had in days, and as I wait for her to fill my plate, I’m in danger ofactually drooling.As I chew, I try to pay attention to Tigris telling us how she acquired it, butthe main thing I absorb is that fur underwear is a valuable trading item at themoment. Especially for people who left their homes underdressed. Many are stillout on the street, trying to find shelter for the night. Those who live in thechoice apartments of the inner city have not flung open their doors to house thedisplaced. On the contrary, most of them bolted their locks, drew theirshutters, and pretended to be out. Now the City Circle’s packed with refugees,and the Peacekeepers are going door to door, breaking into places if they haveto, to assign houseguests.On the television, we watch a terse Head Peacekeeper lay out specific rulesregarding how many people per square foot each resident will be expected to takein. He reminds the citizens of the Capitol that temperatures will drop wellbelow freezing tonight and warns them that their president expects them to benot only willing but enthusiastic hosts in this time of crisis. Then they showsome very staged-looking shots of concerned citizens welcoming grateful refugeesinto their homes. The Head Peacekeeper says the president himself has orderedpart of his mansion readied to receive citizens tomorrow. He adds thatshopkeepers should also be prepared to lend their floor space if requested.“Tigris, that could be you,” says Peeta. I realize he’s right. That even thisnarrow hallway of a shop could be appropriated as the numbers swell. Then we’llbe truly trapped in the cellar, in constant danger of discovery. How many daysdo we have? One? Maybe two?The Head Peacekeeper comes back with more instructions for the population. Itseems that this evening there was an unfortunate incident where a crowd beat todeath a young man who resembled Peeta. Henceforth, all rebel sightings are to bereported immediately to authorities, who will deal with the identification andarrest of the suspect. They show a photo of the victim. Apart from someobviously bleached curls, he looks about as much like Peeta as I do.“People have gone wild,” Cressida murmurs.We watch a brief rebel update in which we learn that several more blocks havebeen taken today. I make note of the intersections on my map and study it. “LineC is only four blocks from here,” I announce. Somehow that fills me with moreanxiety than the idea of Peacekeepers looking for housing. I become veryhelpful. “Let me wash the dishes.”“I’ll give you a hand.” Gale collects the plates.I feel Peeta’s eyes follow us out of the room. In the cramped kitchen at theback of Tigris’s shop, I fill the sink with hot water and suds. “Do you thinkit’s true?” I ask. “That Snow will let refugees into the mansion?”“I think he has to now, at least for the cameras,” says Gale.“I’m leaving in the morning,” I say.“I’m going with you,” Gale says. “What should we do with the others?”“Pollux and Cressida could be useful. They’re good guides,” I say. Pollux andCressida aren’t actually the problem. “But Peeta’s too…”“Unpredictable,” finishes Gale. “Do you think he’d still let us leave himbehind?”“We can make the argument that he’ll endanger us,” I say. “He might stay here,if we’re convincing.”Peeta’s fairly rational about our suggestion. He readily agrees that his companycould put the other four of us at risk. I’m thinking this may all work out, thathe can just sit out the war in Tigris’s cellar, when he announces he’s going outon his own.“To do what?” asks Cressida.“I’m not sure exactly. The one thing that I might still be useful at is causinga diversion. You saw what happened to that man who looked like me,” he says.“What if you…lose control?” I say.“You mean…go mutt? Well, if I feel that coming on, I’ll try to get back here,”he assures me.“And if Snow gets you again?” asks Gale. “You don’t even have a gun.”“I’ll just have to take my chances,” says Peeta. “Like the rest of you.” The twoexchange a long look, and then Gale reaches into his breast pocket. He placeshis nightlock tablet in Peeta’s hand. Peeta lets it lie on his open palm,neither rejecting nor accepting it. “What about you?”“Don’t worry. Beetee showed me how to detonate my explosive arrows by hand. Ifthat fails, I’ve got my knife. And I’ll have Katniss,” says Gale with a smile.“She won’t give them the satisfaction of taking me alive.”The thought of Peacekeepers dragging Gale away starts the tune playing in myhead again….Are you, are youComing to the tree“Take it, Peeta,” I say in a strained voice. I reach out and close his fingersover the pill. “No one will be there to help you.”We spend a fitful night, woken by one another’s nightmares, minds buzzing withthe next day’s plans. I’m relieved when five o’clock rolls around and we canbegin whatever this day holds for us. We eat a mishmash of our remainingfood—canned peaches, crackers, and snails—leaving one can of salmon for Tigrisas meager thanks for all she’s done. The gesture seems to touch her in some way.Her face contorts in an odd expression and she flies into action. She spends thenext hour remaking the five of us. She redresses us so regular clothes hide ouruniforms before we even don our coats and cloaks. Covers our military boots withsome sort of furry slippers. Secures our wigs with pins. Cleans off the garishremains of the paint we so hastily applied to our faces and makes us up again.Drapes our outerwear to conceal our weapons. Then gives us handbags and bundlesof knickknacks to carry. In the end, we look exactly like the refugees fleeingthe rebels.“Never underestimate the power of a brilliant stylist,” says Peeta. It’s hard totell, but I think Tigris might actually blush under her stripes.There are no helpful updates on the television, but the alley seems as thickwith refugees as the previous morning. Our plan is to slip into the crowd inthree groups. First Cressida and Pollux, who will act as guides while keeping asafe lead on us. Then Gale and myself, who intend to position ourselves amongthe refugees assigned to the mansion today. Then Peeta, who will trail behindus, ready to create a disturbance as needed.Tigris watches through the shutters for the right moment, unbolts the door, andnods to Cressida and Pollux. “Take care,” Cressida says, and they are gone.We’ll be following in a minute. I get out the key, unlock Peeta’s cuffs, andstuff them in my pocket. He rubs his wrists. Flexes them. I feel a kind ofdesperation rising up in me. It’s like I’m back in the Quarter Quell, withBeetee giving Johanna and me that coil of wire.“Listen,” I say. “Don’t do anything foolish.”“No. It’s last-resort stuff. Completely,” he says.I wrap my arms around his neck, feel his arms hesitate before they embrace me.Not as steady as they once were, but still warm and strong. A thousand momentssurge through me. All the times these arms were my only refuge from the world.Perhaps not fully appreciated then, but so sweet in my memory, and now goneforever. “All right, then.” I release him.“It’s time,” says Tigris. I kiss her cheek, fasten my red hooded cloak, pull myscarf up over my nose, and follow Gale out into the frigid air.Sharp, icy snowflakes bite my exposed skin. The rising sun’s trying to breakthrough the gloom without much success. There’s enough light to see the bundledforms closest to you and little more. Perfect conditions, really, except that Ican’t locate Cressida and Pollux. Gale and I drop our heads and shuffle alongwith the refugees. I can hear what I missed peeking through the shuttersyesterday. Crying, moaning, labored breathing. And, not too far away, gunfire.“Where are we going, Uncle?” a shivering little boy asks a man weighed down witha small safe.“To the president’s mansion. They’ll assign us a new place to live,” puffs theman.We turn off the alley and spill out onto one of the main avenues. “Stay to theright!” a voice orders, and I see the Peacekeepers interspersed throughout thecrowd, directing the flow of human traffic. Scared faces peer out of theplate-glass windows of the shops, which are already becoming overrun withrefugees. At this rate, Tigris may have new houseguests by lunch. It was goodfor everybody that we got out when we did.It’s brighter now, even with the snow picking up. I catch sight of Cressida andPollux about thirty yards ahead of us, plodding along with the crowd. I crane myhead around to see if I can locate Peeta. I can’t, but I’ve caught the eye of aninquisitive-looking little girl in a lemon yellow coat. I nudge Gale and slow mypace ever so slightly, to allow a wall of people to form between us.“We might need to split up,” I say under my breath. “There’s a girl—”Gunfire rips through the crowd, and several people near me slump to the ground.Screams pierce the air as a second round mows down another group behind us. Galeand I drop to the street, scuttle the ten yards to the shops, and take coverbehind a display of spike-heeled boots outside a shoe seller’s.A row of feathery footwear blocks Gale’s view. “Who is it? Can you see?” he asksme. What I can see, between alternating pairs of lavender and mint green leatherboots, is a street full of bodies. The little girl who was watching me kneelsbeside a motionless woman, screeching and trying to rouse her. Another wave ofbullets slices across the chest of her yellow coat, staining it with red,knocking the girl onto her back. For a moment, looking at her tiny crumpledform, I lose my ability to form words. Gale prods me with his elbow. “Katniss?”“They’re shooting from the roof above us,” I tell Gale. I watch a few morerounds, see the white uniforms dropping into the snowy streets. “Trying to takeout the Peacekeepers, but they’re not exactly crack shots. It must be therebels.” I don’t feel a rush of joy, although theoretically my allies havebroken through. I am transfixed by that lemon yellow coat.“If we start shooting, that’s it,” Gale says. “The whole world will know it’sus.”It’s true. We’re armed only with our fabulous bows. To release an arrow would belike announcing to both sides that we’re here.“No,” I say forcefully. “We’ve got to get to Snow.”“Then we better start moving before the whole block goes up,” says Gale. Huggingthe wall, we continue along the street. Only the wall is mostly shopwindows. Apattern of sweaty palms and gaping faces presses against the glass. I yank myscarf up higher over my cheekbones as we dart between outdoor displays. Behind arack of framed photos of Snow, we encounter a wounded Peacekeeper proppedagainst a strip of brick wall. He asks us for help. Gale knees him in the sideof the head and takes his gun. At the intersection, he shoots a secondPeacekeeper and we both have firearms.“So who are we supposed to be now?” I ask.“Desperate citizens of the Capitol,” says Gale. “The Peacekeepers will thinkwe’re on their side, and hopefully the rebels have more interesting targets.”I’m mulling over the wisdom of this latest role as we sprint across theintersection, but by the time we reach the next block, it no longer matters whowe are. Who anyone is. Because no one is looking at faces. The rebels are here,all right. Pouring onto the avenue, taking cover in doorways, behind vehicles,guns blazing, hoarse voices shouting commands as they prepare to meet an army ofPeacekeepers marching toward us. Caught in the cross fire are the refugees,unarmed, disoriented, many wounded.A pod’s activated ahead of us, releasing a gush of steam that parboils everyonein its path, leaving the victims intestine-pink and very dead. After that, whatlittle sense of order there was unravels. As the remaining curlicues of steamintertwine with the snow, visibility extends just to the end of my barrel.Peacekeeper, rebel, citizen, who knows? Everything that moves is a target.People shoot reflexively, and I’m no exception. Heart pounding, adrenalineburning through me, everyone is my enemy. Except Gale. My hunting partner, theone person who has my back. There’s nothing to do but move forward, killingwhoever comes into our path. Screaming people, bleeding people, dead peopleeverywhere. As we reach the next corner, the entire block ahead of us lights upwith a rich purple glow. We backpedal, hunker down in a stairwell, and squintinto the light. Something’s happening to those illuminated by it. They’reassaulted by…what? A sound? A wave? A laser? Weapons fall from their hands,fingers clutch their faces, as blood sprays from all visible orifices—eyes,noses, mouths, ears. In less than a minute, everyone’s dead and the glowvanishes. I grit my teeth and run, leaping over the bodies, feet slipping in thegore. The wind whips the snow into blinding swirls but doesn’t block out thesound of another wave of boots headed our way.“Get down!” I hiss at Gale. We drop where we are. My face lands in a still-warmpool of someone’s blood, but I play dead, remain motionless as the boots marchover us. Some avoid the bodies. Others grind into my hand, my back, kick my headin passing. As the boots recede, I open my eyes and nod to Gale.On the next block, we encounter more terrified refugees, but few soldiers. Justwhen it seems we might have caught a break, there’s a cracking sound, like anegg hitting the side of a bowl but magnified a thousand times. We stop, lookaround for the pod. There’s nothing. Then I feel the tips of my boots beginningto tilt ever so slightly. “Run!” I cry to Gale. There’s no time to explain, butin a few seconds the nature of the pod becomes clear to everyone. A seam hasopened up down the center of the block. The two sides of the tiled street arefolding down like flaps, slowly emptying the people into whatever lies beneath.I’m torn between making a beeline for the next intersection and trying to get tothe doors that line the street and break my way into a building. As a result, Iend up moving at a slight diagonal. As the flap continues to drop, I find myfeet scrambling, harder and harder, to find purchase on the slippery tiles. It’slike running along the side of an icy hill that gets steeper at every step. Bothof my destinations—the intersection and the buildings—are a few feet away when Ifeel the flap going. There’s nothing to do but use my last seconds of connectionto the tiles to push off for the intersection. As my hands latch on to the side,I realize the flaps have swung straight down. My feet dangle in the air, nofoothold anywhere. From fifty feet below, a vile stench hits my nose, likerotted corpses in the summer heat. Black forms crawl around in the shadows,silencing whoever survives the fall.A strangled cry comes from my throat. No one is coming to help me. I’m losing mygrip on the icy ledge, when I see I’m only about six feet from the corner of thepod. I inch my hands along the ledge, trying to block out the terrifying soundsfrom below. When my hands straddle the corner, I swing my right boot up over theside. It catches on something and I painstakingly drag myself up to streetlevel. Panting, trembling, I crawl out and wrap my arm around a lamppost for ananchor, although the ground’s perfectly flat.“Gale?” I call into the abyss, heedless of being recognized. “Gale?”“Over here!” I look in bewilderment to my left. The flap held up everything tothe very base of the buildings. A dozen or so people made it that far and nowhang from whatever provides a handhold. Doorknobs, knockers, mail slots. Threedoors down from me, Gale clings to the decorative iron grating around anapartment door. He could easily get inside if it was open. But despite repeatedkicks to the door, no one comes to his aid.“Cover yourself!” I lift my gun. He turns away and I drill the lock until thedoor flies inward. Gale swings into the doorway, landing in a heap on the floor.For a moment, I experience the elation of his rescue. Then the white-glovedhands clamp down on him.Gale meets my eyes, mouths something at me I can’t make out. I don’t know whatto do. I can’t leave him, but I can’t reach him either. His lips move again. Ishake my head to indicate my confusion. At any minute, they’ll realize whothey’ve captured. The Peacekeepers are hauling him inside now. “Go!” I hear himyell.I turn and run away from the pod. All alone now. Gale a prisoner. Cressida andPollux could be dead ten times over. And Peeta? I haven’t laid eyes on him sincewe left Tigris’s. I hold on to the idea that he may have gone back. Felt anattack coming and retreated to the cellar while he still had control. Realizedthere was no need for a diversion when the Capitol has provided so many. No needto be bait and have to take the nightlock—the nightlock! Gale doesn’t have any.And as for all that talk of detonating his arrows by hand, he’ll never get thechance. The first thing the Peacekeepers will do is to strip him of his weapons.I fall into a doorway, tears stinging my eyes. Shoot me. That’s what he wasmouthing. I was supposed to shoot him! That was my job. That was our unspokenpromise, all of us, to one another. And I didn’t do it and now the Capitol willkill him or torture him or hijack him or—the cracks begin opening inside me,threatening to break me into pieces. I have only one hope. That the Capitolfalls, lays down its arms, and gives up its prisoners before they hurt Gale. ButI can’t see that happening while Snow’s alive.A pair of Peacekeepers runs by, barely glancing at the whimpering Capitol girlhuddled in a doorway. I choke down my tears, wipe the existing ones off my facebefore they can freeze, and pull myself back together. Okay, I’m still ananonymous refugee. Or did the Peacekeepers who caught Gale get a glimpse of meas I fled? I remove my cloak and turn it inside out, letting the black liningshow instead of the red exterior. Arrange the hood so it conceals my face.Grasping my gun close to my chest, I survey the block. There’s only a handful ofdazed-looking stragglers. I trail close behind a pair of old men who take nonotice of me. No one will expect me to be with old men. When we reach the end ofthe next intersection, they stop and I almost bump into them. It’s the CityCircle. Across the wide expanse ringed by grand buildings sits the president’smansion.The Circle’s full of people milling around, wailing, or just sitting and lettingthe snow pile up around them. I fit right in. I begin to weave my way across tothe mansion, tripping over abandoned treasures and snow-frosted limbs. Abouthalfway there, I become aware of the concrete barricade. It’s about four feethigh and extends in a large rectangle in front of the mansion. You would thinkit would be empty, but it’s packed with refugees. Maybe this is the group that’sbeen chosen to be sheltered at the mansion? But as I draw closer, I noticesomething else. Everyone inside the barricade is a child. Toddlers to teenagers.Scared and frostbitten. Huddled in groups or rocking numbly on the ground. Theyaren’t being led into the mansion. They’re penned in, guarded on all sides byPeacekeepers. I know immediately it’s not for their protection. If the Capitolwanted to safeguard them, they’d be down in a bunker somewhere. This is forSnow’s protection. The children form his human shield.There’s a commotion and the crowd surges to the left. I’m caught up by largerbodies, borne sideways, carried off course. I hear shouts of “The rebels! Therebels!” and know they must’ve broken through. The momentum slams me into aflagpole and I cling to it. Using the rope that hangs from the top, I pullmyself up out of the crush of bodies. Yes, I can see the rebel army pouring intothe Circle, driving the refugees back onto the avenues. I scan the area for thepods that will surely be detonating. But that doesn’t happen. This is whathappens:A hovercraft marked with the Capitol’s seal materializes directly over thebarricaded children. Scores of silver parachutes rain down on them. Even in thischaos, the children know what silver parachutes contain. Food. Medicine. Gifts.They eagerly scoop them up, frozen fingers struggling with the strings. Thehovercraft vanishes, five seconds pass, and then about twenty parachutessimultaneously explode.A wail rises from the crowd. The snow’s red and littered with undersized bodyparts. Many of the children die immediately, but others lie in agony on theground. Some stagger around mutely, staring at the remaining silver parachutesin their hands, as if they still might have something precious inside. I cantell the Peacekeepers didn’t know this was coming by the way they are yankingaway the barricades, making a path to the children. Another flock of whiteuniforms sweeps into the opening. But these aren’t Peacekeepers. They’re medics.Rebel medics. I’d know the uniforms anywhere. They swarm in among the children,wielding medical kits.First I get a glimpse of the blond braid down her back. Then, as she yanks offher coat to cover a wailing child, I notice the duck tail formed by her untuckedshirt. I have the same reaction I did the day Effie Trinket called her name atthe reaping. At least, I must go limp, because I find myself at the base of theflagpole, unable to account for the last few seconds. Then I am pushing throughthe crowd, just as I did before. Trying to shout her name above the roar. I’malmost there, almost to the barricade, when I think she hears me. Because forjust a moment, she catches sight of me, her lips form my name.And that’s when the rest of the parachutes go off."},{"pageContent":"25 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_25]Real or not real? I am on fire. The balls of flame that erupted from theparachutes shot over the barricades, through the snowy air, and landed in thecrowd. I was just turning away when one caught me, ran its tongue up the back ofmy body, and transformed me into something new. A creature as unquenchable asthe sun.A fire mutt knows only a single sensation: agony. No sight, no sound, no feelingexcept the unrelenting burning of flesh. Perhaps there are periods ofunconsciousness, but what can it matter if I can’t find refuge in them? I amCinna’s bird, ignited, flying frantically to escape something inescapable. Thefeathers of flame that grow from my body. Beating my wings only fans the blaze.I consume myself, but to no end.Finally, my wings begin to falter, I lose height, and gravity pulls me into afoamy sea the color of Finnick’s eyes. I float on my back, which continues toburn beneath the water, but the agony quiets to pain. When I am adrift andunable to navigate, that’s when they come. The dead.The ones I loved fly as birds in the open sky above me. Soaring, weaving,calling to me to join them. I want so badly to follow them, but the seawatersaturates my wings, making it impossible to lift them. The ones I hated havetaken to the water, horrible scaled things that tear my salty flesh with needleteeth. Biting again and again. Dragging me beneath the surface.The small white bird tinged in pink dives down, buries her claws in my chest,and tries to keep me afloat. “No, Katniss! No! You can’t go!”But the ones I hated are winning, and if she clings to me, she’ll be lost aswell. “Prim, let go!” And finally she does.Deep in the water, I’m deserted by all. There’s only the sound of my breathing,the enormous effort it takes to draw the water in, push it out of my lungs. Iwant to stop, I try to hold my breath, but the sea forces its way in and outagainst my will. “Let me die. Let me follow the others,” I beg whatever holds mehere. There’s no response.Trapped for days, years, centuries maybe. Dead, but not allowed to die. Alive,but as good as dead. So alone that anyone, anything no matter how loathsomewould be welcome. But when I finally have a visitor, it’s sweet. Morphling.Coursing through my veins, easing the pain, lightening my body so that it risesback toward the air and rests again on the foam.Foam. I really am floating on foam. I can feel it beneath the tips of myfingers, cradling parts of my naked body. There’s much pain but there’s alsosomething like reality. The sandpaper of my throat. The smell of burn medicinefrom the first arena. The sound of my mother’s voice. These things frighten me,and I try to return to the deep to make sense of them. But there’s no goingback. Gradually, I’m forced to accept who I am. A badly burned girl with nowings. With no fire. And no sister.In the dazzling white Capitol hospital, the doctors work their magic on me.Draping my rawness in new sheets of skin. Coaxing the cells into thinking theyare my own. Manipulating my body parts, bending and stretching the limbs toassure a good fit. I hear over and over again how lucky I am. My eyes werespared. Most of my face was spared. My lungs are responding to treatment. I willbe as good as new.When my tender skin has toughened enough to withstand the pressure of sheets,more visitors arrive. The morphling opens the door to the dead and alive alike.Haymitch, yellow and unsmiling. Cinna, stitching a new wedding dress. Delly,prattling on about the niceness of people. My father sings all four stanzas of“The Hanging Tree” and reminds me that my mother—who sleeps in a chair betweenshifts—isn’t to know about it.One day I awake to expectations and know I will not be allowed to live in mydreamland. I must take food by mouth. Move my own muscles. Make my way to thebathroom. A brief appearance by President Coin clinches it.“Don’t worry,” she says. “I’ve saved him for you.”The doctors’ puzzlement grows over why I’m unable to speak. Many tests are done,and while there’s damage to my vocal cords, it doesn’t account for it. Finally,Dr. Aurelius, a head doctor, comes up with the theory that I’ve become a mental,rather than physical, Avox. That my silence has been brought on by emotionaltrauma. Although he’s presented with a hundred proposed remedies, he tells themto leave me alone. So I don’t ask about anyone or anything, but people bring mea steady stream of information. On the war: The Capitol fell the day theparachutes went off, President Coin leads Panem now, and troops have been sentout to put down the small remaining pockets of Capitol resistance. On PresidentSnow: He’s being held prisoner, awaiting trial and most certain execution. On myassassination team: Cressida and Pollux have been sent out into the districts tocover the wreckage of the war. Gale, who took two bullets in an escape attempt,is mopping up Peacekeepers in 2. Peeta’s still in the burn unit. He made it tothe City Circle after all. On my family: My mother buries her grief in her work.Having no work, grief buries me. All that keeps me going is Coin’s promise. ThatI can kill Snow. And when that’s done, nothing will be left.Eventually, I’m released from the hospital and given a room in the president’smansion to share with my mother. She’s almost never there, taking her meals andsleeping at work. It falls to Haymitch to check on me, make sure I’m eating andusing my medicines. It’s not an easy job. I take to my old habits from District13. Wandering unauthorized through the mansion. Into bedrooms and offices,ballrooms and baths. Seeking strange little hiding spaces. A closet of furs. Acabinet in the library. A long-forgotten bathtub in a room of discardedfurniture. My places are dim and quiet and impossible to find. I curl up, makemyself smaller, try to disappear entirely. Wrapped in silence, I slide mybracelet that reads mentally disoriented around and around my wrist.My name is Katniss Everdeen. I am seventeen years old. My home is District 12.There is no District 12. I am the Mockingjay. I brought down the Capitol.President Snow hates me. He killed my sister. Now I will kill him. And then theHunger Games will be over….Periodically, I find myself back in my room, unsure whether I was driven by aneed for morphling or if Haymitch ferreted me out. I eat the food, take themedicine, and am required to bathe. It’s not the water I mind, but the mirrorthat reflects my naked fire-mutt body. The skin grafts still retain anewborn-baby pinkness. The skin deemed damaged but salvageable looks red, hot,and melted in places. Patches of my former self gleam white and pale. I’m like abizarre patchwork quilt of skin. Parts of my hair were singed off completely;the rest has been chopped off at odd lengths. Katniss Everdeen, the girl who wason fire. I wouldn’t much care except the sight of my body brings back the memoryof the pain. And why I was in pain. And what happened just before the painstarted. And how I watched my little sister become a human torch.Closing my eyes doesn’t help. Fire burns brighter in the darkness.Dr. Aurelius shows up sometimes. I like him because he doesn’t say stupid thingslike how I’m totally safe, or that he knows I can’t see it but I’ll be happyagain one day, or even that things will be better in Panem now. He just asks ifI feel like talking, and when I don’t answer, he falls asleep in his chair. Infact, I think his visits are largely motivated by his need for a nap. Thearrangement works for both of us.The time draws near, although I could not give you exact hours and minutes.President Snow has been tried and found guilty, sentenced to execution. Haymitchtells me, I hear talk of it as I drift past the guards in the hallways. MyMockingjay suit arrives in my room. Also my bow, looking no worse for wear, butno sheath of arrows. Either because they were damaged or more likely because Ishouldn’t have weapons. I vaguely wonder if I should be preparing for the eventin some way, but nothing comes to mind.Late one afternoon, after a long period in a cushioned window seat behind apainted screen, I emerge and turn left instead of right. I find myself in astrange part of the mansion, and immediately lose my bearings. Unlike the areawhere I’m quartered, there seems to be no one around to ask. I like it, though.Wish I’d found it sooner. It’s so quiet, with the thick carpets and heavytapestries soaking up the sound. Softly lit. Muted colors. Peaceful. Until Ismell the roses. I dive behind some curtains, shaking too hard to run, while Iawait the mutts. Finally, I realize there are no mutts coming. So, what do Ismell? Real roses? Could it be that I am near the garden where the evil thingsgrow?As I creep down the hall, the odor becomes overpowering. Perhaps not as strongas the actual mutts, but purer, because it’s not competing with sewage andexplosives. I turn a corner and find myself staring at two surprised guards. NotPeacekeepers, of course. There are no more Peacekeepers. But not the trim,gray-uniformed soldiers from 13 either. These two, a man and a woman, wear thetattered, thrown-together clothes of actual rebels. Still bandaged and gaunt,they are now keeping watch over the doorway to the roses. When I move to enter,their guns form an X in front of me.“You can’t go in, miss,” says the man.“Soldier,” the woman corrects him. “You can’t go in, Soldier Everdeen.President’s orders.”I just stand there patiently waiting for them to lower their guns, for them tounderstand, without my telling them, that behind those doors is something Ineed. Just a rose. A single bloom. To place in Snow’s lapel before I shoot him.My presence seems to worry the guards. They’re discussing calling Haymitch, whena woman speaks up behind me. “Let her go in.”I know the voice but can’t immediately place it. Not Seam, not 13, definitelynot Capitol. I turn my head and find myself face-to-face with Paylor, thecommander from 8. She looks even more beat up than she did at the hospital, butwho doesn’t?“On my authority,” says Paylor. “She has a right to anything behind that door.”These are her soldiers, not Coin’s. They drop their weapons without question andlet me pass.At the end of a short hallway, I push apart the glass doors and step inside. Bynow the smell’s so strong that it begins to flatten out, as if there’s no moremy nose can absorb. The damp, mild air feels good on my hot skin. And the rosesare glorious. Row after row of sumptuous blooms, in lush pink, sunset orange,and even pale blue. I wander through the aisles of carefully pruned plants,looking but not touching, because I have learned the hard way how deadly thesebeauties can be. I know when I find it, crowning the top of a slender bush. Amagnificent white bud just beginning to open. I pull my left sleeve over my handso that my skin won’t actually have to touch it, take up a pair of pruningshears, and have just positioned them on the stem when he speaks.“That’s a nice one.”My hand jerks, the shears snap shut, severing the stem.“The colors are lovely, of course, but nothing says perfection like white.”I still can’t see him, but his voice seems to rise up from an adjacent bed ofred roses. Delicately pinching the stem of the bud through the fabric of mysleeve, I move slowly around the corner and find him sitting on a stool againstthe wall. He’s as well groomed and finely dressed as ever, but weighted downwith manacles, ankle shackles, tracking devices. In the bright light, his skin’sa pale, sickly green. He holds a white handkerchief spotted with fresh blood.Even in his deteriorated state, his snake eyes shine bright and cold. “I washoping you’d find your way to my quarters.”His quarters. I have trespassed into his home, the way he slithered into minelast year, hissing threats with his bloody, rosy breath. This greenhouse is oneof his rooms, perhaps his favorite; perhaps in better times he tended the plantshimself. But now it’s part of his prison. That’s why the guards halted me. Andthat’s why Paylor let me in.I’d supposed he would be secured in the deepest dungeon that the Capitol had tooffer, not cradled in the lap of luxury. Yet Coin left him here. To set aprecedent, I guess. So that if in the future she ever fell from grace, it wouldbe understood that presidents—even the most despicable—get special treatment.Who knows, after all, when her own power might fade?“There are so many things we should discuss, but I have a feeling your visitwill be brief. So, first things first.” He begins to cough, and when he removesthe handkerchief from his mouth, it’s redder. “I wanted to tell you how verysorry I am about your sister.”Even in my deadened, drugged condition, this sends a stab of pain through me.Reminding me that there are no limits to his cruelty. And how he will go to hisgrave trying to destroy me.“So wasteful, so unnecessary. Anyone could see the game was over by that point.In fact, I was just about to issue an official surrender when they releasedthose parachutes.” His eyes are glued on me, unblinking, so as not to miss asecond of my reaction. But what he’s said makes no sense. When they released theparachutes? “Well, you really didn’t think I gave the order, did you? Forget theobvious fact that if I’d had a working hovercraft at my disposal, I’d have beenusing it to make an escape. But that aside, what purpose could it have served?We both know I’m not above killing children, but I’m not wasteful. I take lifefor very specific reasons. And there was no reason for me to destroy a pen fullof Capitol children. None at all.”I wonder if the next fit of coughing is staged so that I can have time to absorbhis words. He’s lying. Of course, he’s lying. But there’s something strugglingto free itself from the lie as well.“However, I must concede it was a masterful move on Coin’s part. The idea that Iwas bombing our own helpless children instantly snapped whatever frailallegiance my people still felt to me. There was no real resistance after that.Did you know it aired live? You can see Plutarch’s hand there. And in theparachutes. Well, it’s that sort of thinking that you look for in a HeadGamemaker, isn’t it?” Snow dabs the corners of his mouth. “I’m sure he wasn’tgunning for your sister, but these things happen.”I’m not with Snow now. I’m in Special Weaponry back in 13 with Gale and Beetee.Looking at the designs based on Gale’s traps. That played on human sympathies.The first bomb killed the victims. The second, the rescuers. Remembering Gale’swords.“Beetee and I have been following the same rule book President Snow used when hehijacked Peeta.”“My failure,” says Snow, “was being so slow to grasp Coin’s plan. To let theCapitol and districts destroy one another, and then step in to take power withThirteen barely scratched. Make no mistake, she was intending to take my placeright from the beginning. I shouldn’t be surprised. After all, it was Thirteenthat started the rebellion that led to the Dark Days, and then abandoned therest of the districts when the tide turned against it. But I wasn’t watchingCoin. I was watching you, Mockingjay. And you were watching me. I’m afraid wehave both been played for fools.”I refuse for this to be true. Some things even I can’t survive. I utter my firstwords since my sister’s death. “I don’t believe you.”Snow shakes his head in mock disappointment. “Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen. Ithought we had agreed not to lie to each other.”"},{"pageContent":"26 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_26]Out in the hall, I find Paylor standing in exactly the same spot. “Did you findwhat you were looking for?” she asks.I hold up the white bud in answer and then stumble past her. I must have made itback to my room, because the next thing I know, I’m filling a glass with waterfrom the bathroom faucet and sticking the rose in it. I sink to my knees on thecold tile and squint at the flower, as the whiteness seems hard to focus on inthe stark fluorescent light. My finger catches the inside of my bracelet,twisting it like a tourniquet, hurting my wrist. I’m hoping the pain will helpme hang on to reality the way it did for Peeta. I must hang on. I must know thetruth about what has happened.There are two possibilities, although the details associated with them may vary.First, as I’ve believed, that the Capitol sent in that hovercraft, dropped theparachutes, and sacrificed its children’s lives, knowing the recently arrivedrebels would go to their aid. There’s evidence to support this. The Capitol’sseal on the hovercraft, the lack of any attempt to blow the enemy out of thesky, and their long history of using children as pawns in their battle againstthe districts. Then there’s Snow’s account. That a Capitol hovercraft manned byrebels bombed the children to bring a speedy end to the war. But if this was thecase, why didn’t the Capitol fire on the enemy? Did the element of surprisethrow them? Had they no defenses left? Children are precious to 13, or so it hasalways seemed. Well, not me, maybe. Once I had outlived my usefulness, I wasexpendable. Although I think it’s been a long time since I’ve been considered achild in this war. And why would they do it knowing their own medics wouldlikely respond and be taken out by the second blast? They wouldn’t. Theycouldn’t. Snow’s lying. Manipulating me as he always has. Hoping to turn meagainst the rebels and possibly destroy them. Yes. Of course.Then what’s nagging at me? Those double-exploding bombs, for one. It’s not thatthe Capitol couldn’t have the same weapon, it’s just that I’m sure the rebelsdid. Gale and Beetee’s brainchild. Then there’s the fact that Snow made noescape attempt, when I know him to be the consummate survivor. It seems hard tobelieve he didn’t have a retreat somewhere, some bunker stocked with provisionswhere he could live out the rest of his snaky little life. And finally, there’shis assessment of Coin. What’s irrefutable is that she’s done exactly what hesaid. Let the Capitol and the districts run one another into the ground and thensauntered in to take power. Even if that was her plan, it doesn’t mean shedropped those parachutes. Victory was already in her grasp. Everything was inher grasp.Except me.I recall Boggs’s response when I admitted I hadn’t put much thought into Snow’ssuccessor. “If your immediate answer isn’t Coin, then you’re a threat. You’rethe face of the rebellion. You may have more influence than any other singleperson. Outwardly, the most you’ve ever done is tolerated her.”Suddenly, I’m thinking of Prim, who was not yet fourteen, not yet old enough tobe granted the title of soldier, but somehow working on the front lines. How didsuch a thing happen? That my sister would have wanted to be there, I have nodoubt. That she would be more capable than many older than she is a given. Butfor all that, someone very high up would have had to approve putting athirteen-year-old in combat. Did Coin do it, hoping that losing Prim would pushme completely over the edge? Or, at least, firmly on her side? I wouldn’t evenhave had to witness it in person. Numerous cameras would be covering the CityCircle. Capturing the moment forever.No, now I am going crazy, slipping into some state of paranoia. Too many peoplewould know of the mission. Word would get out. Or would it? Who would have toknow besides Coin, Plutarch, and a small, loyal or easily disposable crew?I badly need help working this out, only everyone I trust is dead. Cinna. Boggs.Finnick. Prim. There’s Peeta, but he couldn’t do any more than speculate, andwho knows what state his mind’s in, anyway. And that leaves only Gale. He’s faraway, but even if he were beside me, could I confide in him? What could I say,how could I phrase it, without implying that it was his bomb that killed Prim?The impossibility of that idea, more than any, is why Snow must be lying.Ultimately, there’s only one person to turn to who might know what happened andmight still be on my side. To broach the subject at all will be a risk. Butwhile I think Haymitch might gamble with my life in the arena, I don’t thinkhe’d rat me out to Coin. Whatever problems we may have with each other, weprefer resolving our differences one-on-one.I scramble off the tiles, out the door, and across the hall to his room. Whenthere’s no response to my knock, I push inside. Ugh. It’s amazing how quickly hecan defile a space. Half-eaten plates of food, shattered liquor bottles, andpieces of broken furniture from a drunken rampage scatter his quarters. He lies,unkempt and unwashed, in a tangle of sheets on the bed, passed out.“Haymitch,” I say, shaking his leg. Of course, that’s insufficient. But I giveit a few more tries before I dump the pitcher of water in his face. He comes towith a gasp, slashing blindly with his knife. Apparently, the end of Snow’sreign didn’t equal the end of his terror.“Oh. You,” he says. I can tell by his voice that he’s still loaded.“Haymitch,” I begin.“Listen to that. The Mockingjay found her voice.” He laughs. “Well, Plutarch’sgoing to be happy.” He takes a swig from a bottle. “Why am I soaking wet?” Ilamely drop the pitcher behind me into a pile of dirty clothes.“I need your help,” I say.Haymitch belches, filling the air with white liquor fumes. “What is it,sweetheart? More boy trouble?” I don’t know why, but this hurts me in a wayHaymitch rarely can. It must show on my face, because even in his drunken state,he tries to take it back. “Okay, not funny.” I’m already at the door. “Notfunny! Come back!” By the thud of his body hitting the floor, I assume he triedto follow me, but there’s no point.I zigzag through the mansion and disappear into a wardrobe full of silkenthings. I yank them from hangers until I have a pile and then burrow into it. Inthe lining of my pocket, I find a stray morphling tablet and swallow it dry,heading off my rising hysteria. It’s not enough to right things, though. I hearHaymitch calling me in the distance, but he won’t find me in his condition.Especially not in this new spot. Swathed in silk, I feel like a caterpillar in acocoon awaiting metamorphosis. I always supposed that to be a peacefulcondition. At first it is. But as I journey into night, I feel more and moretrapped, suffocated by the slippery bindings, unable to emerge until I havetransformed into something of beauty. I squirm, trying to shed my ruined bodyand unlock the secret to growing flawless wings. Despite enormous effort, Iremain a hideous creature, fired into my current form by the blast from thebombs.The encounter with Snow opens the door to my old repertoire of nightmares. It’slike being stung by tracker jackers again. A wave of horrifying images with abrief respite I confuse with waking—only to find another wave knocking me back.When the guards finally locate me, I’m sitting on the floor of the wardrobe,tangled in silk, screaming my head off. I fight them at first, until theyconvince me they’re trying to help, peel away the choking garments, and escortme back to my room. On the way, we pass a window and I see a gray, snowy dawnspreading across the Capitol.A very hungover Haymitch waits with a handful of pills and a tray of food thatneither of us has the stomach for. He makes a feeble attempt to get me to talkagain but, seeing it’s pointless, sends me to a bath someone has drawn. Thetub’s deep, with three steps to the bottom. I ease down into the warm water andsit, up to my neck in suds, hoping the medicines kick in soon. My eyes focus onthe rose that has spread its petals overnight, filling the steamy air with itsstrong perfume. I rise and reach for a towel to smother it, when there’s atentative knock and the bathroom door opens, revealing three familiar faces.They try to smile at me, but even Venia can’t conceal her shock at my ravagedmutt body. “Surprise!” Octavia squeaks, and then bursts into tears. I’m puzzlingover their reappearance when I realize that this must be it, the day of theexecution. They’ve come to prep me for the cameras. Remake me to Beauty BaseZero. No wonder Octavia’s crying. It’s an impossible task.They can barely touch my patchwork of skin for fear of hurting me, so I rinseand dry off myself. I tell them I hardly notice the pain anymore, but Flaviusstill winces as he drapes a robe around me. In the bedroom, I find anothersurprise. Sitting upright in a chair. Polished from her metallic gold wig to herpatent leather high heels, gripping a clipboard. Remarkably unchanged except forthe vacant look in her eyes.“Effie,” I say.“Hello, Katniss.” She stands and kisses me on the cheek as if nothing hasoccurred since our last meeting, the night before the Quarter Quell. “Well, itlooks like we’ve got another big, big, big day ahead of us. So why don’t youstart your prep and I’ll just pop over and check on the arrangements.”“Okay,” I say to her back.“They say Plutarch and Haymitch had a hard time keeping her alive,” commentsVenia under her breath. “She was imprisoned after your escape, so that helps.”It’s quite a stretch. Effie Trinket, rebel. But I don’t want Coin killing her,so I make a mental note to present her that way if asked. “I guess it’s goodPlutarch kidnapped you three after all.”“We’re the only prep team still alive. And all the stylists from the QuarterQuell are dead,” says Venia. She doesn’t say who specifically killed them. I’mbeginning to wonder if it matters. She gingerly takes one of my scarred handsand holds it out for inspection. “Now, what do you think for the nails? Red ormaybe a jet black?”Flavius performs some beauty miracle on my hair, managing to even out the frontwhile getting some of the longer locks to hide the bald spots in the back. Myface, since it was spared from the flames, presents no more than the usualchallenges. Once I’m in Cinna’s Mockingjay suit, the only scars visible are onmy neck, forearms, and hands. Octavia secures my Mockingjay pin over my heartand we step back to look in the mirror. I can’t believe how normal they’ve mademe look on the outside when inwardly I’m such a wasteland.There’s a tap at the door and Gale steps in. “Can I have a minute?” he asks. Inthe mirror, I watch my prep team. Unsure of where to go, they bump into oneanother a few times and then closet themselves in the bathroom. Gale comes upbehind me and we examine each other’s reflection. I’m searching for something tohang on to, some sign of the girl and boy who met by chance in the woods fiveyears ago and became inseparable. I’m wondering what would have happened to themif the Hunger Games had not reaped the girl. If she would have fallen in lovewith the boy, married him even. And sometime in the future, when the brothersand sisters had been raised up, escaped with him into the woods and left 12behind forever. Would they have been happy, out in the wild, or would the dark,twisted sadness between them have grown up even without the Capitol’s help?“I brought you this.” Gale holds up a sheath. When I take it, I notice it holdsa single, ordinary arrow. “It’s supposed to be symbolic. You firing the lastshot of the war.”“What if I miss?” I say. “Does Coin retrieve it and bring it back to me? Or justshoot Snow through the head herself?”“You won’t miss.” Gale adjusts the sheath on my shoulder.We stand there, face-to-face, not meeting each other’s eyes. “You didn’t comesee me in the hospital.” He doesn’t answer, so finally I just say it. “Was ityour bomb?”“I don’t know. Neither does Beetee,” he says. “Does it matter? You’ll always bethinking about it.”He waits for me to deny it; I want to deny it, but it’s true. Even now I can seethe flash that ignites her, feel the heat of the flames. And I will never beable to separate that moment from Gale. My silence is my answer.“That was the one thing I had going for me. Taking care of your family,” hesays. “Shoot straight, okay?” He touches my cheek and leaves. I want to call himback and tell him that I was wrong. That I’ll figure out a way to make peacewith this. To remember the circumstances under which he created the bomb. Takeinto account my own inexcusable crimes. Dig up the truth about who dropped theparachutes. Prove it wasn’t the rebels. Forgive him. But since I can’t, I’lljust have to deal with the pain.Effie comes in to usher me to some kind of meeting. I collect my bow and at thelast minute remember the rose, glistening in its glass of water. When I open thedoor to the bathroom, I find my prep team sitting in a row on the edge of thetub, hunched and defeated. I remember I’m not the only one whose world has beenstripped away. “Come on,” I tell them. “We’ve got an audience waiting.”I’m expecting a production meeting in which Plutarch instructs me where to standand gives me my cue for shooting Snow. Instead, I find myself sent into a roomwhere six people sit around a table. Peeta, Johanna, Beetee, Haymitch, Annie,and Enobaria. They all wear the gray rebel uniforms from 13. No one looksparticularly well. “What’s this?” I say.“We’re not sure,” Haymitch answers. “It appears to be a gathering of theremaining victors.”“We’re all that’s left?” I ask.“The price of celebrity,” says Beetee. “We were targeted from both sides. TheCapitol killed the victors they suspected of being rebels. The rebels killedthose thought to be allied with the Capitol.”Johanna scowls at Enobaria. “So what’s she doing here?”“She is protected under what we call the Mockingjay Deal,” says Coin as sheenters behind me. “Wherein Katniss Everdeen agreed to support the rebels inexchange for captured victors’ immunity. Katniss has upheld her side of thebargain, and so shall we.”Enobaria smiles at Johanna. “Don’t look so smug,” says Johanna. “We’ll kill youanyway.”“Sit down, please, Katniss,” says Coin, closing the door. I take a seat betweenAnnie and Beetee, carefully placing Snow’s rose on the table. As usual, Coingets right to the point. “I’ve asked you here to settle a debate. Today we willexecute Snow. In the previous weeks, hundreds of his accomplices in theoppression of Panem have been tried and now await their own deaths. However, thesuffering in the districts has been so extreme that these measures appearinsufficient to the victims. In fact, many are calling for a completeannihilation of those who held Capitol citizenship. However, in the interest ofmaintaining a sustainable population, we cannot afford this.”Through the water in the glass, I see a distorted image of one of Peeta’s hands.The burn marks. We are both fire mutts now. My eyes travel up to where theflames licked across his forehead, singeing away his brows but just missing hiseyes. Those same blue eyes that used to meet mine and then flit away at school.Just as they do now.“So, an alternative has been placed on the table. Since my colleagues and I cancome to no consensus, it has been agreed that we will let the victors decide. Amajority of four will approve the plan. No one may abstain from the vote,” saysCoin. “What has been proposed is that in lieu of eliminating the entire Capitolpopulation, we have a final, symbolic Hunger Games, using the children directlyrelated to those who held the most power.”All seven of us turn to her. “What?” says Johanna.“We hold another Hunger Games using Capitol children,” says Coin.“Are you joking?” asks Peeta.“No. I should also tell you that if we do hold the Games, it will be known itwas done with your approval, although the individual breakdown of your voteswill be kept secret for your own security,” Coin tells us.“Was this Plutarch’s idea?” asks Haymitch.“It was mine,” says Coin. “It seemed to balance the need for vengeance with theleast loss of life. You may cast your votes.”“No!” bursts out Peeta. “I vote no, of course! We can’t have another HungerGames!”“Why not?” Johanna retorts. “It seems very fair to me. Snow even has agranddaughter. I vote yes.”“So do I,” says Enobaria, almost indifferently. “Let them have a taste of theirown medicine.”“This is why we rebelled! Remember?” Peeta looks at the rest of us. “Annie?”“I vote no with Peeta,” she says. “So would Finnick if he were here.”“But he isn’t, because Snow’s mutts killed him,” Johanna reminds her.“No,” says Beetee. “It would set a bad precedent. We have to stop viewing oneanother as enemies. At this point, unity is essential for our survival. No.”“We’re down to Katniss and Haymitch,” says Coin.Was it like this then? Seventy-five years or so ago? Did a group of people sitaround and cast their votes on initiating the Hunger Games? Was there dissent?Did someone make a case for mercy that was beaten down by the calls for thedeaths of the districts’ children? The scent of Snow’s rose curls up into mynose, down into my throat, squeezing it tight with despair. All those people Iloved, dead, and we are discussing the next Hunger Games in an attempt to avoidwasting life. Nothing has changed. Nothing will ever change now.I weigh my options carefully, think everything through. Keeping my eyes on therose, I say, “I vote yes…for Prim.”“Haymitch, it’s up to you,” says Coin.A furious Peeta hammers Haymitch with the atrocity he could become party to, butI can feel Haymitch watching me. This is the moment, then. When we find outexactly just how alike we are, and how much he truly understands me.“I’m with the Mockingjay,” he says.“Excellent. That carries the vote,” says Coin. “Now we really must take ourplaces for the execution.”As she passes me, I hold up the glass with the rose. “Can you see that Snow’swearing this? Just over his heart?”Coin smiles. “Of course. And I’ll make sure he knows about the Games.”“Thank you,” I say.People sweep into the room, surround me. The last touch of powder, theinstructions from Plutarch as I’m guided to the front doors of the mansion. TheCity Circle runs over, spills people down the side streets. The others taketheir places outside. Guards. Officials. Rebel leaders. Victors. I hear thecheers that indicate Coin has appeared on the balcony. Then Effie taps myshoulder, and I step out into the cold winter sunlight. Walk to my position,accompanied by the deafening roar of the crowd. As directed, I turn so they seeme in profile, and wait. When they march Snow out the door, the audience goesinsane. They secure his hands behind a post, which is unnecessary. He’s notgoing anywhere. There’s nowhere to go. This is not the roomy stage before theTraining Center but the narrow terrace in front of the president’s mansion. Nowonder no one bothered to have me practice. He’s ten yards away.I feel the bow purring in my hand. Reach back and grasp the arrow. Position it,aim at the rose, but watch his face. He coughs and a bloody dribble runs downhis chin. His tongue flicks over his puffy lips. I search his eyes for theslightest sign of anything, fear, remorse, anger. But there’s only the same lookof amusement that ended our last conversation. It’s as if he’s speaking thewords again. “Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen. I thought we had agreed not to lie toeach other.”He’s right. We did.The point of my arrow shifts upward. I release the string. And President Coincollapses over the side of the balcony and plunges to the ground. Dead."},{"pageContent":"27 [mockingjay_TOC.html#ch_27]In the stunned reaction that follows, I’m aware of one sound. Snow’s laughter.An awful gurgling cackle accompanied by an eruption of foamy blood when thecoughing begins. I see him bend forward, spewing out his life, until the guardsblock him from my sight.As the gray uniforms begin to converge on me, I think of what my brief future asthe assassin of Panem’s new president holds. The interrogation, probabletorture, certain public execution. Having, yet again, to say my final goodbyesto the handful of people who still maintain a hold on my heart. The prospect offacing my mother, who will now be entirely alone in the world, decides it.“Good night,” I whisper to the bow in my hand and feel it go still. I raise myleft arm and twist my neck down to rip off the pill on my sleeve. Instead myteeth sink into flesh. I yank my head back in confusion to find myself lookinginto Peeta’s eyes, only now they hold my gaze. Blood runs from the teeth markson the hand he clamped over my nightlock. “Let me go!” I snarl at him, trying towrest my arm from his grasp.“I can’t,” he says. As they pull me away from him, I feel the pocket ripped frommy sleeve, see the deep violet pill fall to the ground, watch Cinna’s last giftget crunched under a guard’s boot. I transform into a wild animal, kicking,clawing, biting, doing whatever I can to free myself from this web of hands asthe crowd pushes in. The guards lift me up above the fray, where I continue tothrash as I’m conveyed over the crush of people. I start screaming for Gale. Ican’t find him in the throng, but he will know what I want. A good clean shot toend it all. Only there’s no arrow, no bullet. Is it possible he can’t see me?No. Above us, on the giant screens placed around the City Circle, everyone canwatch the whole thing being played out. He sees, he knows, but he doesn’t followthrough. Just as I didn’t when he was captured. Sorry excuses for hunters andfriends. Both of us.I’m on my own.In the mansion, they handcuff and blindfold me. I’m half dragged, half carrieddown long passages, up and down elevators, and deposited on a carpeted floor.The cuffs are removed and a door slams closed behind me. When I push theblindfold up, I find I’m in my old room at the Training Center. The one where Ilived during those last precious days before my first Hunger Games and theQuarter Quell. The bed’s stripped to the mattress, the closet gapes open,showing the emptiness inside, but I’d know this room anywhere.It’s a struggle to get to my feet and peel off my Mockingjay suit. I’m badlybruised and might have a broken finger or two, but it’s my skin that’s paid mostdearly for my struggle with the guards. The new pink stuff has shredded liketissue paper and blood seeps through the laboratory-grown cells. No medics showup, though, and as I’m too far gone to care, I crawl up onto the mattress,expecting to bleed to death.No such luck. By evening, the blood clots, leaving me stiff and sore and stickybut alive. I limp into the shower and program in the gentlest cycle I canremember, free of any soaps and hair products, and squat under the warm spray,elbows on my knees, head in my hands.My name is Katniss Everdeen. Why am I not dead? I should be dead. It would bebest for everyone if I were dead….When I step out on the mat, the hot air bakes my damaged skin dry. There’snothing clean to put on. Not even a towel to wrap around me. Back in the room, Ifind the Mockingjay suit has disappeared. In its place is a paper robe. A mealhas been sent up from the mysterious kitchen with a container of my medicationsfor dessert. I go ahead and eat the food, take the pills, rub the salve on myskin. I need to focus now on the manner of my suicide.I curl back up on the bloodstained mattress, not cold but feeling so naked withjust the paper to cover my tender flesh. Jumping to my death’s not an option—thewindow glass must be a foot thick. I can make an excellent noose, but there’snothing to hang myself from. It’s possible I could hoard my pills and then knockmyself off with a lethal dose, except that I’m sure I’m being watched round theclock. For all I know, I’m on live television at this very moment whilecommentators try to analyze what could possibly have motivated me to kill Coin.The surveillance makes almost any suicide attempt impossible. Taking my life isthe Capitol’s privilege. Again.What I can do is give up. I resolve to lie on the bed without eating, drinking,or taking my medications. I could do it, too. Just die. If it weren’t for themorphling withdrawal. Not bit by bit like in the hospital in 13, but coldturkey. I must have been on a fairly large dose because when the craving for ithits, accompanied by tremors, and shooting pains, and unbearable cold, myresolve’s crushed like an eggshell. I’m on my knees, raking the carpet with myfingernails to find those precious pills I flung away in a stronger moment. Irevise my suicide plan to slow death by morphling. I will become ayellow-skinned bag of bones, with enormous eyes. I’m a couple of days into theplan, making good progress, when something unexpected happens.I begin to sing. At the window, in the shower, in my sleep. Hour after hour ofballads, love songs, mountain airs. All the songs my father taught me before hedied, for certainly there has been very little music in my life since. What’samazing is how clearly I remember them. The tunes, the lyrics. My voice, atfirst rough and breaking on the high notes, warms up into something splendid. Avoice that would make the mockingjays fall silent and then tumble overthemselves to join in. Days pass, weeks. I watch the snows fall on the ledgeoutside my window. And in all that time, mine is the only voice I hear.What are they doing, anyway? What’s the holdup out there? How difficult can itbe to arrange the execution of one murderous girl? I continue with my ownannihilation. My body’s thinner than it’s ever been and my battle against hungeris so fierce that sometimes the animal part of me gives in to the temptation ofbuttered bread or roasted meat. But still, I’m winning. For a few days I feelquite unwell and think I may finally be traveling out of this life, when Irealize my morphling tablets are shrinking. They are trying to slowly wean meoff the stuff. But why? Surely a drugged Mockingjay will be easier to dispose ofin front of a crowd. And then a terrible thought hits me: What if they’re notgoing to kill me? What if they have more plans for me? A new way to remake,train, and use me?I won’t do it. If I can’t kill myself in this room, I will take the firstopportunity outside of it to finish the job. They can fatten me up. They cangive me a full body polish, dress me up, and make me beautiful again. They candesign dream weapons that come to life in my hands, but they will never againbrainwash me into the necessity of using them. I no longer feel any allegianceto these monsters called human beings, despise being one myself. I think thatPeeta was onto something about us destroying one another and letting some decentspecies take over. Because something is significantly wrong with a creature thatsacrifices its children’s lives to settle its differences. You can spin it anyway you like. Snow thought the Hunger Games were an efficient means of control.Coin thought the parachutes would expedite the war. But in the end, who does itbenefit? No one. The truth is, it benefits no one to live in a world where thesethings happen.After two days of my lying on my mattress with no attempt to eat, drink, or eventake a morphling tablet, the door to my room opens. Someone crosses around thebed into my field of vision. Haymitch. “Your trial’s over,” he says. “Come on.We’re going home.”Home? What’s he talking about? My home’s gone. And even if it were possible togo to this imaginary place, I am too weak to move. Strangers appear. Rehydrateand feed me. Bathe and clothe me. One lifts me like a rag doll and carries me upto the roof, onto a hovercraft, and fastens me into a seat. Haymitch andPlutarch sit across from me. In a few moments, we’re airborne.I’ve never seen Plutarch in such a good mood. He’s positively glowing. “You musthave a million questions!” When I don’t respond, he answers them anyway.After I shot Coin, there was pandemonium. When the ruckus died down, theydiscovered Snow’s body, still tethered to the post. Opinions differ on whetherhe choked to death while laughing or was crushed by the crowd. No one reallycares. An emergency election was thrown together and Paylor was voted in aspresident. Plutarch was appointed secretary of communications, which means hesets the programming for the airwaves. The first big televised event was mytrial, in which he was also a star witness. In my defense, of course. Althoughmost of the credit for my exoneration must be given to Dr. Aurelius, whoapparently earned his naps by presenting me as a hopeless, shell-shockedlunatic. One condition for my release is that I’ll continue under his care,although it will have to be by phone because he’d never live in a forsaken placelike 12, and I’m confined there until further notice. The truth is, no one quiteknows what to do with me now that the war’s over, although if another one shouldspring up, Plutarch’s sure they could find a role for me. Then Plutarch has agood laugh. It never seems to bother him when no one else appreciates his jokes.“Are you preparing for another war, Plutarch?” I ask.“Oh, not now. Now we’re in that sweet period where everyone agrees that ourrecent horrors should never be repeated,” he says. “But collective thinking isusually short-lived. We’re fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a greatgift for self-destruction. Although who knows? Maybe this will be it, Katniss.”“What?” I ask.“The time it sticks. Maybe we are witnessing the evolution of the human race.Think about that.” And then he asks me if I’d like to perform on a new singingprogram he’s launching in a few weeks. Something upbeat would be good. He’llsend the crew to my house.We land briefly in District 3 to drop off Plutarch. He’s meeting with Beetee toupdate the technology on the broadcast system. His parting words to me are“Don’t be a stranger.”When we’re back among the clouds, I look at Haymitch. “So why are you going backto Twelve?”“They can’t seem to find a place for me in the Capitol either,” he says.At first, I don’t question this. But doubts begin to creep in. Haymitch hasn’tassassinated anyone. He could go anywhere. If he’s coming back to 12, it’sbecause he’s been ordered to. “You have to look after me, don’t you? As mymentor?” He shrugs. Then I realize what it means. “My mother’s not coming back.”“No,” he says. He pulls an envelope from his jacket pocket and hands it to me. Iexamine the delicate, perfectly formed writing. “She’s helping to start up ahospital in District Four. She wants you to call as soon as we get in.” Myfinger traces the graceful swoop of the letters. “You know why she can’t comeback.” Yes, I know why. Because between my father and Prim and the ashes, theplace is too painful to bear. But apparently not for me. “Do you want to knowwho else won’t be there?”“No,” I say. “I want to be surprised.”Like a good mentor, Haymitch makes me eat a sandwich and then pretends hebelieves I’m asleep for the rest of the trip. He busies himself going throughevery compartment on the hovercraft, finding the liquor, and stowing it in hisbag. It’s night when we land on the green of the Victor’s Village. Half of thehouses have lights in the windows, including Haymitch’s and mine. Not Peeta’s.Someone has built a fire in my kitchen. I sit in the rocker before it, clutchingmy mother’s letter.“Well, see you tomorrow,” says Haymitch.As the clinking of his bag of liquor bottles fades away, I whisper, “I doubtit.”I am unable to move from the chair. The rest of the house looms cold and emptyand dark. I pull an old shawl over my body and watch the flames. I guess Isleep, because the next thing I know, it’s morning and Greasy Sae’s bangingaround at the stove. She makes me eggs and toast and sits there until I’ve eatenit all. We don’t talk much. Her little granddaughter, the one who lives in herown world, takes a bright blue ball of yarn from my mother’s knitting basket.Greasy Sae tells her to put it back, but I say she can have it. No one in thishouse can knit anymore. After breakfast, Greasy Sae does the dishes and leaves,but she comes back up at dinnertime to make me eat again. I don’t know if she’sjust being neighborly or if she’s on the government’s payroll, but she shows uptwice every day. She cooks, I consume. I try to figure out my next move. There’sno obstacle now to taking my life. But I seem to be waiting for something.Sometimes the phone rings and rings and rings, but I don’t pick it up. Haymitchnever visits. Maybe he changed his mind and left, although I suspect he’s justdrunk. No one comes but Greasy Sae and her granddaughter. After months ofsolitary confinement, they seem like a crowd.“Spring’s in the air today. You ought to get out,” she says. “Go hunting.”I haven’t left the house. I haven’t even left the kitchen except to go to thesmall bathroom a few steps off of it. I’m in the same clothes I left the Capitolin. What I do is sit by the fire. Stare at the unopened letters piling up on themantel. “I don’t have a bow.”“Check down the hall,” she says.After she leaves, I consider a trip down the hall. Rule it out. But afterseveral hours, I go anyway, walking in silent sock feet, so as not to awaken theghosts. In the study, where I had my tea with President Snow, I find a box withmy father’s hunting jacket, our plant book, my parents’ wedding photo, the spileHaymitch sent in, and the locket Peeta gave me in the clock arena. The two bowsand a sheath of arrows Gale rescued on the night of the firebombing lie on thedesk. I put on the hunting jacket and leave the rest of the stuff untouched. Ifall asleep on the sofa in the formal living room. A terrible nightmare follows,where I’m lying at the bottom of a deep grave, and every dead person I know byname comes by and throws a shovel full of ashes on me. It’s quite a long dream,considering the list of people, and the deeper I’m buried, the harder it is tobreathe. I try to call out, begging them to stop, but the ashes fill my mouthand nose and I can’t make any sound. Still the shovel scrapes on and on and on….I wake with a start. Pale morning light comes around the edges of the shutters.The scraping of the shovel continues. Still half in the nightmare, I run downthe hall, out the front door, and around the side of the house, because now I’mpretty sure I can scream at the dead. When I see him, I pull up short. His faceis flushed from digging up the ground under the windows. In a wheelbarrow arefive scraggly bushes.“You’re back,” I say.“Dr. Aurelius wouldn’t let me leave the Capitol until yesterday,” Peeta says.“By the way, he said to tell you he can’t keep pretending he’s treating youforever. You have to pick up the phone.”He looks well. Thin and covered with burn scars like me, but his eyes have lostthat clouded, tortured look. He’s frowning slightly, though, as he takes me in.I make a halfhearted effort to push my hair out of my eyes and realize it’smatted into clumps. I feel defensive. “What are you doing?”“I went to the woods this morning and dug these up. For her,” he says. “Ithought we could plant them along the side of the house.”I look at the bushes, the clods of dirt hanging from their roots, and catch mybreath as the word rose registers. I’m about to yell vicious things at Peetawhen the full name comes to me. Not plain rose but evening primrose. The flowermy sister was named for. I give Peeta a nod of assent and hurry back into thehouse, locking the door behind me. But the evil thing is inside, not out.Trembling with weakness and anxiety, I run up the stairs. My foot catches on thelast step and I crash onto the floor. I force myself to rise and enter my room.The smell’s very faint but still laces the air. It’s there. The white rose amongthe dried flowers in the vase. Shriveled and fragile, but holding on to thatunnatural perfection cultivated in Snow’s greenhouse. I grab the vase, stumbledown to the kitchen, and throw its contents into the embers. As the flowersflare up, a burst of blue flame envelops the rose and devours it. Fire beatsroses again. I smash the vase on the floor for good measure.Back upstairs, I throw open the bedroom windows to clear out the rest of Snow’sstench. But it still lingers, on my clothes and in my pores. I strip, and flakesof skin the size of playing cards cling to the garments. Avoiding the mirror, Istep into the shower and scrub the roses from my hair, my body, my mouth. Brightpink and tingling, I find something clean to wear. It takes half an hour to combout my hair. Greasy Sae unlocks the front door. While she makes breakfast, Ifeed the clothes I had shed to the fire. At her suggestion, I pare off my nailswith a knife.Over the eggs, I ask her, “Where did Gale go?”“District Two. Got some fancy job there. I see him now and again on thetelevision,” she says.I dig around inside myself, trying to register anger, hatred, longing. I findonly relief.“I’m going hunting today,” I say.“Well, I wouldn’t mind some fresh game at that,” she answers.I arm myself with a bow and arrows and head out, intending to exit 12 throughthe Meadow. Near the square are teams of masked and gloved people withhorse-drawn carts. Sifting through what lay under the snow this winter.Gathering remains. A cart’s parked in front of the mayor’s house. I recognizeThom, Gale’s old crewmate, pausing a moment to wipe the sweat from his face witha rag. I remember seeing him in 13, but he must have come back. His greetinggives me the courage to ask, “Did they find anyone in there?”“Whole family. And the two people who worked for them,” Thom tells me.Madge. Quiet and kind and brave. The girl who gave me the pin that gave me aname. I swallow hard. Wonder if she’ll be joining the cast of my nightmarestonight. Shoveling the ashes into my mouth. “I thought maybe, since he was themayor…”“I don’t think being the mayor of Twelve put the odds in his favor,” says Thom.I nod and keep moving, careful not to look in the back of the cart. All throughthe town and the Seam, it’s the same. The reaping of the dead. As I near theruins of my old house, the road becomes thick with carts. The Meadow’s gone, orat least dramatically altered. A deep pit has been dug, and they’re lining itwith bones, a mass grave for my people. I skirt around the hole and enter thewoods at my usual place. It doesn’t matter, though. The fence isn’t chargedanymore and has been propped up with long branches to keep out the predators.But old habits die hard. I think about going to the lake, but I’m so weak that Ibarely make it to my meeting place with Gale. I sit on the rock where Cressidafilmed us, but it’s too wide without his body beside me. Several times I closemy eyes and count to ten, thinking that when I open them, he will havematerialized without a sound as he so often did. I have to remind myself thatGale’s in 2 with a fancy job, probably kissing another pair of lips.It is the old Katniss’s favorite kind of day. Early spring. The woods awakeningafter the long winter. But the spurt of energy that began with the primrosesfades away. By the time I make it back to the fence, I’m so sick and dizzy, Thomhas to give me a ride home in the dead people’s cart. Help me to the sofa in theliving room, where I watch the dust motes spin in the thin shafts of afternoonlight.My head snaps around at the hiss, but it takes awhile to believe he’s real. Howcould he have gotten here? I take in the claw marks from some wild animal, theback paw he holds slightly above the ground, the prominent bones in his face.He’s come on foot, then, all the way from 13. Maybe they kicked him out or maybehe just couldn’t stand it there without her, so he came looking.“It was the waste of a trip. She’s not here,” I tell him. Buttercup hissesagain. “She’s not here. You can hiss all you like. You won’t find Prim.” At hername, he perks up. Raises his flattened ears. Begins to meow hopefully. “Getout!” He dodges the pillow I throw at him. “Go away! There’s nothing left foryou here!” I start to shake, furious with him. “She’s not coming back! She’snever ever coming back here again!” I grab another pillow and get to my feet toimprove my aim. Out of nowhere, the tears begin to pour down my cheeks. “She’sdead.” I clutch my middle to dull the pain. Sink down on my heels, rocking thepillow, crying. “She’s dead, you stupid cat. She’s dead.” A new sound, partcrying, part singing, comes out of my body, giving voice to my despair.Buttercup begins to wail as well. No matter what I do, he won’t go. He circlesme, just out of reach, as wave after wave of sobs racks my body, untileventually I fall unconscious. But he must understand. He must know that theunthinkable has happened and to survive will require previously unthinkableacts. Because hours later, when I come to in my bed, he’s there in themoonlight. Crouched beside me, yellow eyes alert, guarding me from the night.In the morning, he sits stoically as I clean the cuts, but digging the thornfrom his paw brings on a round of those kitten mews. We both end up cryingagain, only this time we comfort each other. On the strength of this, I open theletter Haymitch gave me from my mother, dial the phone number, and weep with heras well. Peeta, bearing a warm loaf of bread, shows up with Greasy Sae. Shemakes us breakfast and I feed all my bacon to Buttercup.Slowly, with many lost days, I come back to life. I try to follow Dr. Aurelius’sadvice, just going through the motions, amazed when one finally has meaningagain. I tell him my idea about the book, and a large box of parchment sheetsarrives on the next train from the Capitol.I got the idea from our family’s plant book. The place where we recorded thosethings you cannot trust to memory. The page begins with the person’s picture. Aphoto if we can find it. If not, a sketch or painting by Peeta. Then, in my mostcareful handwriting, come all the details it would be a crime to forget. Ladylicking Prim’s cheek. My father’s laugh. Peeta’s father with the cookies. Thecolor of Finnick’s eyes. What Cinna could do with a length of silk. Boggsreprogramming the Holo. Rue poised on her toes, arms slightly extended, like abird about to take flight. On and on. We seal the pages with salt water andpromises to live well to make their deaths count. Haymitch finally joins us,contributing twenty-three years of tributes he was forced to mentor. Additionsbecome smaller. An old memory that surfaces. A late primrose preserved betweenthe pages. Strange bits of happiness, like the photo of Finnick and Annie’snewborn son.We learn to keep busy again. Peeta bakes. I hunt. Haymitch drinks until theliquor runs out, and then raises geese until the next train arrives.Fortunately, the geese can take pretty good care of themselves. We’re not alone.A few hundred others return because, whatever has happened, this is our home.With the mines closed, they plow the ashes into the earth and plant food.Machines from the Capitol break ground for a new factory where we will makemedicines. Although no one seeds it, the Meadow turns green again.Peeta and I grow back together. There are still moments when he clutches theback of a chair and hangs on until the flashbacks are over. I wake screamingfrom nightmares of mutts and lost children. But his arms are there to comfortme. And eventually his lips. On the night I feel that thing again, the hungerthat overtook me on the beach, I know this would have happened anyway. That whatI need to survive is not Gale’s fire, kindled with rage and hatred. I haveplenty of fire myself. What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The brightyellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can goon, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again. And only Peeta cangive me that.So after, when he whispers, “You love me. Real or not real?”I tell him, “Real.”"},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE [mockingjay_TOC.html#bm_01]They play in the Meadow. The dancing girl with the dark hair and blue eyes. Theboy with blond curls and gray eyes, struggling to keep up with her on his chubbytoddler legs. It took five, ten, fifteen years for me to agree. But Peeta wantedthem so badly. When I first felt her stirring inside of me, I was consumed witha terror that felt as old as life itself. Only the joy of holding her in my armscould tame it. Carrying him was a little easier, but not much.The questions are just beginning. The arenas have been completely destroyed, thememorials built, there are no more Hunger Games. But they teach about them atschool, and the girl knows we played a role in them. The boy will know in a fewyears. How can I tell them about that world without frightening them to death?My children, who take the words of the song for granted:Deep in the meadow, under the willowA bed of grass, a soft green pillowLay down your head, and close your sleepy eyesAnd when again they open, the sun will rise.Here it’s safe, here it’s warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love you.My children, who don’t know they play on a graveyard.Peeta says it will be okay. We have each other. And the book. We can make themunderstand in a way that will make them braver. But one day I’ll have to explainabout my nightmares. Why they came. Why they won’t ever really go away.I’ll tell them how I survive it. I’ll tell them that on bad mornings, it feelsimpossible to take pleasure in anything because I’m afraid it could be takenaway. That’s when I make a list in my head of every act of goodness I’ve seensomeone do. It’s like a game. Repetitive. Even a little tedious after more thantwenty years.But there are much worse games to play.
