Published by Magitech Press P.O. Box 1298, Woodstock, GA 30188 RUNE YOGA LESSON I Welcome to a most fascinating discipline that enables you to harnesses energies from the realms of creation by means of utilizing SHAPES. The shapes which you are going to use are based on the ancient Runes. They serve as triggers which give you access to energies of creation. Students and practitioners of Rune Yoga have the goal of achieving a balance of the physical, emotional, and mental bodies, which is at the basis of perfect health; they use Rune Yoga as a gateway to their chakras and to deep mystical experiences; and they learn the power to project Light energy. Students of Rune Yoga are encouraged to practice in groups. Unlike in conventional Yoga systems, where students practice individually, Rune Yoga knows of practices that are based on group-interaction. In such interaction, each individual is assigned a specific function within the group-position as a whole. Consequently, the group-position will always be of a qualitatively (and most times also quantitatively) higher order than the mere sum total of the energies which each individual would draw. This important characteristic makes Rune Yoga an excellent tool to build groups for joint practice of Runic ceremonials. To achieve the benefits of Rune Yoga, the student utilizes many different types of shapes. Rune Yoga constitutes a unique combination of body- and hand positions (shapes of the body), controlled breathing techniques (rhythmic shapes), Rune Mantras (shapes of sound), focus on specific symbols or groups of symbols (Runic shapes, geometrical or graphic outlines which may be visualized), a meditative awareness of realms within (a link between shapes and worlds of experience), runic sound pitches (again shapes of sound) and ceremonial settings. Ceremonial settings constitute a link between shapes and objective energies of the realms of creation as well as to defined Higher Order Energy Complexes (HOEC's). In this course, you will advance in Rune Yoga by means of practicical experience. Ideally you should practice with a group. If you cannot practice with a group, it will be beneficial for you to imagine that you practice within a group. In this case ayou can take various positions within this group. This is not unlike playing with \"invisible playmates\", or thought forms. Such practice will make it easier for you to practice with a real group whenever you have such an opportunity. It will also enhance tremendously some of the effects of Rune Yoga over what you would achieve when simply practicing with the consciousness of being an individual. With practice, you will increasingly penetrate the intricacies of the discipline of Rune Yoga, much of which is in creative realms beyond purely logical thinking. Therefore, I will give only as much theoretical knowledge as is absolutely necessary. 1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 1 You find the meanings of Runes in the Basic Rune Course. In addition to the meanings of Runes that you find in the Basic Rune Course, there are additional meanings, or functions, of Runes. These are meanings that are of key importance for your practice of Rune Yoga. It will be good for you to memorize these meanings well: FA is an ENERGIZING Rune. It is used to DRAW LIFE ENERGIES, and also to PROJECT them. It relates to 'fire\". Often perceived as warm to hot, and red or orange. Sometimes also \"blue fire\". UR is CALMING and HEALING. It gives STRENGTH, and it is used to accumulate life energies. Often perceived warm, steady, green, growing. THORN is EMITTING, SENDING, SPIRALLING. OS is a function of ACCEPTING and receiving, focus of ODIC (or Orgone) ENERGIES. RIT is ROTATING and DANCING. Ceremonial rhythms and structures. KA is STRENGTH and POWER. Release of sexual energies. Projection of power. STRENGTH and POWER. Release of sexual energies. Project ion of power. HAGAL is BALANCING in all directions, crystallizing. \"Taking care of the universe\". NOD is KARRMIC STRUCTURING. The lever to shift karma. IS is function of the spine, i.e., the system of CHAKRAS as a whole. Emotional calmness achieved as a result of calming down thoughts. ANTENNA TO DRAW energies. AR is mental energy, RELEASING of the past and refraining, energy of the Sun. SIG is SUDDEN EFFORT, or sudden impact. Lightning-like strike, Victory, Impact. TYRis ACTION OF THE HIGHER SELF. Odin gets rid of illusions amid attachments. BAR is sleep, withdrawal, deepest meditations, TOTAL CALMNESS, empty chaos from which life sprouts eternally. LAF is law of LIFE FUNCTIONING. Nature. MAN is PHYSICAL STRENGTH energized by spirit, drawing from above, levitation (reaching above). YR is DRAWING FROM THE ROOTS. Awareness of roots-eternal. (MAN and YR together form the world crystal of HAGAL) EH is balance of life streams. Balance of sexual energies. MALE - FEMALE BALANCE (EH and 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 1 NOD together form the world crystal of HAGAL) GIBOR is the dance of life forces, dance of lives around the universal structure of HAGAL.. MOVEMENT, COMPLETION. PRACTICE 1. If you have already an altar for Runic practice, set up your Crystal Runes, or Rune Staves. Light one candle. If you are at the beginning of Runic practice, keep the ceremonial setting (see the third lesson for more details) as simple as possible, yet already present. Simply light a candle as a focal point, and be aware that the candle represents Light. Symbolically it links you with the realms of creation. 2. The group practices a short meditation, approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Students of Rune Magic may establish their inner Rune Realm, and join all individual realms to one. Say, with a ceremonial attitude: \"May the power of the Runes Lead us to a greater understanding Of the universe and ourselves. May the power of the Runes Further our path to Oneness With the Universe. 4. Everybody standing in a circle, body position of MAN 5. Chant MAN 3 times. 6. Sit down, meditate a for a few minutes. Then share experiences, or, if you practice by yourself, write in a diary. You have just practiced Rune Yoga: A body position and the chanting of a mantra in a ceremonial setting. Perhaps also the focus on the graphic shape of MAN. Some first-time students may have felt a very strong energy flow. MAN is a good introduction in Runic practice. ,This is so, because it tunes into spiritual realms. Next, let's draw energies to energize ourselves: as individuals and as a group. 7. Again, everybody stand up, in a circle. All take the body position Of FA. The hands are pointing toward the center of the circle. First, chant FA three times, then breathe slowly while you are still aware of the chanting: inhale four seconds, hold your breath two seconds, exhale four seconds, again hold for two seconds. As you inhale, feel the energies of FA flow through your palms into your body. Practice for one to three minutes, then sit down and meditate. Share experiences. In this practice we added another element to our practice. We practiced with the same Rune, but we added a breathing rhythm, combined with a focus on the body, which is to be energized by FA. 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 1 8. Instead of FA practice with MAN the same way as above. Again, meditate and share experiences. 9. Everybody stands in a circle, and we form the body position of FA. We chant FA three times, then we change into the breathing rhythm. This time, as we inhale, we draw FA into the body through an imaginary gate in the area of the solar plexus.. As we exhale, we draw the energies of FA from the Solar plexus and project it into the area of the third eye. In addition, during inhalation and exhalation, we mentally chant FA. KNOW that this process will continue as long as we stay in the position of FA. Then sit down and meditate. In this practice we added the focus on specific areas of the body. In addition, we started \"training\" our subconscious to continue a process of focusing (or magical action) even when we are no longer consciously attached to this process. This way we can ensure continuity. 10. Practice MAN the same way. 11. Now, instead of standing in a circle, participants form the Rune FA. It may help to outline FA on the floor (with a string). Four or more participants are needed for this exercise. If there are less people, then we have to imagine others. Then, we proceed as in 7. Meditate and share. Then swap positions in the Rune and compare experiences. Next, practice MAN the same way. 12. To end the practice, we ground the energies. Grounding after practice is essential, because it sends back any surplus energies. To ground, we stand in position of IS and we visualize all energies drain through our bodies into the ground, in a similar way as water goes down the drain. With this visualization in mind, we chant IS three times. It will be good to practice the above exercises two to four times before you begin with the second lesson and send your progress report to receive your third lesson. You may practice other body positions. May the power of the Runes Bring you in contact with the realms of spirit and energize body, mind, and aura. 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 2 Rune Yoga Lesson II Welcome to the second lesson of Rune Yoga. In this lesson, you will learn more elements of Rune Yoga. Here we emphasize the use of strengthening and healing energies. Again, much of your progress you will experience as you practice. PRACTICE 1. If you have already an altar for Runic practice, set up your Crystal Runes, or Rune Staves, and light one candle. If you are at the beginning of Runic practice, keep the ceremonial setting simple, yet already present. Simply light a candle as a focal point, and be aware that the candle represents Light. 2. The group practices a short meditation, approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Students of the Basic Rune Course may establish their inner Rune Realm, and join all individual realms to one. Say, with a ceremonial attitude: May the power of the Runes Lead us to a greater understanding Of the universe and ourselves. May the power of the Runes Further our path to Oneness With the Universe.\" 4. Everybody standing in a circle, body position of MAN 5. Chant MAN 3 times. 6. Sit aown, meditate a few minutes. Then share Experiences, or, if you practice by yourself, write in a diary. 7. Again, everybody stand up, in a circle, and pose the body position of FA. Hands pointing toward the center of the circle. First, chant FA three times, then breathe slowly while you are still aware of the chanting: inhale four seconds, hold your breath two seconds, exhale four seconds, again hold for two seconds. As you inhale, feel the energies of FA flow through your palms into your body. Practice for one to three minutes, then sit down and meditate. Share experiences. This practice of FA was performed to energize yourself, so you will be better able to draw the healing energies of UR and to project them. 8. Now, we stand again in a circle, and we practice UR the same way as we practiced FA, meditate and share experiences. UR gave us an experience that was very different from FA or MAN. We filled ourselves with the energies of FA, UR, and MAN. This helps us to draw and project those energies as we continue with the practice. 9. Now, we sit in a circle. We take the hand position of FA with our left hand, and chant FA three times. Next, we begin with our breathing rhythm. While we inhale, we feel the energies 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 2 of FA flow through our left hand into our bodies, and we chant mentally FA. Meditate briefly and share experiences. 10. We practice as in 9, but, when inhaling, we draw FA energies into the area of our solar plexus, when exhaling, we project FA from our solar plexus into our right hand from where we allow it to leave through the palm of the right hand or through the fingertips of the right hand. Meditate and share. 11. Practice the same way as 10, but this time you point your palm - or the focussed fingertips, toward the forehead of a partner, at the location of the third eye. Then, your partner projects FA onto your forehead in the area of the third eye. Meditate and share. Practice MAN the same way. 12. Practice with the handposition of UR, alternate both handpositions so you may find out which one of the two positions suits you better. You may point UR toward other parts of the body. Also, alternate hands, which one drawes and which one projects, and feel the differences. 13. All participants form the position of the Rune UR. Draw energies of UR and project in the center of the Rune, or into a specific area of the altar, or of the room. Next, project on one of the participants. 14. Same practice as in 13, but this time everybody visualizes the healing energies of UR projected on a person they know needs it. This projection is to be done mentally. Those participants who do not know the person who is to benefit from Runic energies may project their energies on one of the participants who knows the person and who then mentally directs all energies, his own and those of others. Warning: This should never be understood as a substitute for qualified medical care. 15. As an alternative, place a photo of the person to be helped on the altar, or any object which is closely linked to this person. If nothing else is available, write the name on a piece of paper which is to be set on the altar. Project UR onto this object. 16. Participants who feel they would like some energizing, or balancing, may receive energies as outlined above. 17. Experience the Rune THORN with hand- and body positions. 18. To end the practice, we ground the energies. Grounding after practice is essential, because it sends back any surplus energies. To ground. we stand in position of IS, and we visualize all energies drain through our bodies into the ground, in a similar way as water goes down the drain. With this visualization in mind, we chant IS three times. May the power of the Runes Bring you in contact with the realms of spirit And energize, heal, and balance body, mind, and aura. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 3 RUNE YOGA LESSON III Welcome to the third letter of instructions of Rune Yoga. While I focused on specific practices in the previous two letters of instruction, I give you a more detailed information about the ceremonial set up in this lesson. The ceremonial set up is very helpful. This is so, because it enables you to set up a plenum of energies within which work is made easier. The Knight of Runes, or Rune Master, refers to the physical set up of the ceremonial. One of the most important sources of \"raw energy\" needed for the practice of energy transfer and triggering is emotional-astral energy. This type energy is in general produced within the context of a good ceremonial setting. A little known alternative is to produce this emotional- astral energy technically. ABOUT CEREMONIAL UTENSILS As I mentioned before, ceremonial utensils are focal points (structural links) for more subtle, higher order energy components. Such higher order energies are essential for the success of the ceremonial. When I speak of the \"symbolic meaning\" of a utensil, then I refer generally to the structures of the Higher Order Energy components that are connected with the specific utensil. Another important characteristic of utensils is the following: As the utensil is used on a regular basis, the transcendental energies (HOEC's or Higher Order Energy Complexes) attached to it increase (and modify to some degree) more and more. Eventually the utensil is capable of \"functioning\" without the practitioner needing to be consciously aware of any of the utensil's inherent characteristics and functions. Thus, a dagger is no longer just a knife, but it is the instrument that gives the practitionner dominion over astral -emotional energy complexes. The basic arrangement of all utensils will set your \"machinery\" or \"central switch board\" ready to function smoothly: it allows you to define energies of a higher order, to make them work for you, and to send them wherever you want to send them. An important factor, then, is to follow exactly all istructions given in order to have the Runic energies and HOEC's (which will be created and/or modified by Runic energies) perform as you intended. This is crucial for manifestation of the desired results on whatever level(s) you projected them. In the following, I discuss the various utensils that are used in the ceremonial set up of Rune Yoga. SPECIFIC UTESNILS 1. THE TEMPLE The temple is your \"workshop\", or, better yet, your place from which you are triggering the HOEC's for specific purposes. It is the space within which you arrange all your tools, or machinery. It is your specific outer realm (outer Rune Realm) from which you reach every point of your universe. You may, in fact, see the temple as a symbol of your universe. As is the case with any 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 3 workplace, cleanliness enhances proper functioning. Since you are working with HOEC's, or \"psychic energies\", be aware that the temple needs also to be free from any kind of psychic debris or pollution, otherwise the results of your practices may be negatively influenced. Many banishing rituals are designed to clean the temple from energies that are not desired. If you follow this runem, you can project psychic energies without undesirable interference. In Rune Yoga, you may use the Runes AR, IS and MAN to cleanse. Many of our students do not have a special room or space available for their temple. Even though a specific assigned space for a temple has great advantages, it is not absolutely essential. You may practice Rune Yoga anywhere. You establish your temple by determining what space will serve as your temple, and by cleansing it from any undesirable psychic energy with AR, MAN, and IS every time before you begin to practice. You may define the boarder of the temple mentally or with a wand or dagger. Depending on the situation, you may chant mentally (yes, you CAN perform a fully valid ceremonial in the midst of a crowd, without anybody noticing what you are doing!), or you may chant aloud while in the body positions of IS (grounding position), MAN, and UR. 2. THE PROTECTIVE CIRCLE The protective circle within your temple is a space within which you are working, unencumbrered by any energy that may be attracted by your work. The circle makes sure that no energies will be present except for those that you desire to be present. It is a barrier against negative energies and other energies that may interfere with the HOEC's that you are going to trigger. This way the circle serves not only to your personal protection from hostile HOEC's, but it also insures a clean functionning of your Yoga practice. An ideal circle is formed by laying out all 18 Runes, which will then be in tune with your Inner Rune Realm. Have the sixteen Runes arranged on the periphery of your circle, starting with FA in the North, counterclockwise to YR, which will then be on the right side of FA. Have EH and GIBOR inside the circle, since those Runes symbolize the marriage of opposites and the universe of the symbolism. The diameter of the circle is dependent on the amount of people participating and, of course, considerations of space. 3. THE ALTAR The altar is the actual workplace, or your control panel. In more advanced practice it can also serve as a point of manifestation for specific HOEC's. In this case specific measures of protection or insulating methods have to be obseved. Being your control panel the altar will contain utensils that connect with the specific structures of the universe and HOEC's with which you are going to work in your ceremonial. Therefore the arrangement of utensils on the altar and the symbols used will vary according to the purpose(s) of your ceremonial. You will, however, notice some CFP (common functionning principle) on all arrangements of your altar. The size of the altar depends on the number of people attending, size of your temple, amount of utensils, etc. For most individual purposes and for small groups, an altar the size of 24 x 30 inches will be adequate. 4. RUNE STAVES 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 3 Since you will use Runic energies, a set of triggers to those energies is of utmost importance. Those Rune staves will be arranged in a circle, as shown in the the diagram. More than the staves around yourself and the altar, the staves on the altar are triggers which conncet with your inner Rune realm and the Runic Realms of Creation. Practical experience has established that this circle alone can give a clean temple and the protective circle as outlined above. However, I still recommend that you practice the banishing and cleansing as well as the establishing of the protective circle wherever possible. You may use Runes made of cardboard and charged accordingly, or you may use Runes made of wood. Crystal Runes are excellent and superior even to the traditional wooden Runes for several reasons. One of the reasons is that the crystalline structure of quartz is the \"hexagonal system\" which is also one of the bases of the Runic symbolism (the hexagon with the three inscribed diameters). Pnother reason for the incredible strength of crystal Runes lies in the fact that crystal energies can be modified and directed: modified by Runic energies which are very kin to the crystalline energies, and directed by means of gridding. Again, I have to refer to the Basic Rune Course. Practitioners who used crystal Runes (and coparecl them to wooden staves) noticed the difference in power immediately! 5. CANDLES Candles symbolize the fire element, your will powers, or the world of emanataion. Furthermore, there is much more symbolic meaning to Candles: There is hardly any ceremonial where Light would not play an important role. Light is neutral. Depending on the action to be performed it assumes some color. Since Light is so important, many ceremonials contain and include something that symbolizes Light. Candles are the preferred utensil to symbolize Light. Of course, there are deeper symbolic meanings connected with candles than that of giving Light. The more you become familiar with various methods involving candles, the more you will become aware of the many symbolic meanings of candles, and the more you will be able to use candles. Candles, as we know, are made of various materials, mostly paraffin, more seldom true bees' wax. Candles may be scented and colored, tailored to special lenghts and shapes, etc. Candles are a excellent tool to help the powers of visualization, or imagination. In our work, we have one or two altar candles and, ideally, 18 candles, one for every Rune. These candles should have the Rune inscribed which they symbolize. 6. THE MAGICAL WAND While the candles connect with the will and the worlds of emanation, the wand is the tool which expresses the will of the practitionner. It is your tool to dominate the HOEC's that have characteristics belonging to the mental spheres. The symbolic of the powerrod or wand will become familiar to you as you advance in Rune Yoga. 7. THE INCENSE BURNER The Incense burner connects you with the mental worlds, with HOEC's that are part of the mental spheres, and with the air element in general. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 3 8. THE DAGGER The dagger (or sword) represents your mind which controls the emotions and HOEC's that belong to the astral spheres. Again, while the incense tunes into the mental worlds, the dagger uses mental energies. 9. THE POWERROD The Powerrod is an ideal combination of wand and dagger. It is very suited for work with Runes, because of the use of a quartz crystal as a tip of the powerrod. 10. THE CUP WITH WATER (OR WINE) The cup connects with the astral worlds and with the emotions. It provides the energy necessary to bring results in your ceremonies. It symbolizes the emotional power of the practitionner. Drinking the water or wine aligns the astral-emotional energies with the goal of the ceremonial. Water accumulates odic energies (life energies) that are 'programmed\" with the goals of the ceremonial. 11. THE HAMMER OF THOR It represents your consciousness that can connect with any point in space-time. In other words, the Hammer of Thor can be projected to any interval in the space-time continuum of your universe. It can be developed into being your specific tool to break the self-imposed limitations of space-time. It symbolizes conscious action that is charged and energized by the other elements (wand, sword, and cup). Once energized, the Hammer of Thor will perform for you. Aain, with repeated practice you will learn more and more about this most powerful tool of Runic ceremonials. Thor's Hammer is perhaps the best symbol of your conscious projection. It collects within itself the three elements of the will, mental, and astral-emotional spheres. Once you have charged Thor's Hammer, you have aligned all elements toward your specific purpose: your will, mind, emotions, and consciousness. All you need to do now, is to throw Thor's Hammer (its higher plane components) toward your goal, which is embedded in an interval of your conscious space-time continuum. Thor's Hammer is your tool on the material planes that reaches beyond the confines of space and time. It is your instrument of power, your connection to your universe, your power of projecting into your universe whatever energy you charge the hammer with, and to whatever interval of space and time you desire to send the hammer. Thor's Hammer, therefore, is the most powerful Runic talisman, symbolizing the element earth on your altar, which you could imagine. You need to learn to use Thor's Hammer properly. Tune into the Nordic mythology of the god Thor and his hammer, and you will gain additional information about this powerful tool of Rune Practice. The material hammer of Thor remains on your altar, of course, but its spiritual parts, or components, you project them to the desired goal. You do this directing with the powers of your imagination. Be aware that the more you practice using Thor's Hammer, the more skillful you will become in its use. In fact, RUNE YOGA TEACHES YOU THE SKILL OF PROJECTING AND USING THE HAMMER OF THOR! Ideally, your Hammer of THOR should be a true talisman, which you can wear as a pendant. You may use a piece of paper with Thor's Hammer drawn on it. PREPARATION OF THE UTENSILS Repeated use of a ceremonial utensil connects you with specific energies without you needing to tie up your own forces. Your own forces can then be more effectively directed towards the 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 3 purpose of your practice. In this respect, a utensil takes on the function of a GENERATOR OF ENERGIES that belong to the higher levels. Utensils seen under this aspect, you must realize the importance of proper preparation of your utensils, including yourself, since you will be an integral part of the ceremonial machinery which you are about to se up. Ideally, all utensils should be bought new, and only you should use your utensils. Also, you should charge and bless your own utensils. Never lend your utensils to anybody else. An exception may be candles and incense, as well as some of the accessories of an altar, such as the incense burner, which may be used by anybody who attends the ceremonial. A set of Rune Staves and Hammer of THOR may be shared, and belongs to the altar of a Rune Castle, or lodge. This set may be used by everybody who is member or guest of the group. Your personal Rune Staves, on the other hand, should NEVER be used by anybody else than yourself. This counts as well for group ceremonials. The same holds with your Thor's Hammer, Rune dagger, and other utensils that are your own. Now, to the preparation and blessing of your utensils. The simplest preparation of a utensil is by charging it with your energies. Bring yourself in a meditative state, preferably establish your Rune Realms. Then put the utensil in front of yourself and hold your hands above it. While inhaling, visualize your body drawing energy from the universe. When exhaling, you visualize that energy stream through your hands into the utensil. The charging, of course, has many variations. As you progress with your knowledge of Rune Yoga, your insights will increase, and so will your means available. Prepare all your utensils by charging them. With all utensils prepared, you are well prepared for any ceremony with Runes. PRACTICE 1. While this was not absolutely necessary to mention this in the first lessons, I need now to stress the great importance of your personal preparation. This includes leaving all those things behind which trouble you. It is also essential that you DETACH YOURSELF from any goal that you intend to achieve with your practice of Rune Yoga. It is very advisable for you to take a bath before practicing. It symbolically cleanses you from your worries and anything else which may contaminate the course of your magical operation. It purifies your spiritual centers, when you take your bath with this attitude. Wear clean clothes for the practice. You may have some special clothes for ceremonials, or a special robe. Followers of the old religion prefer to practice nude, for this symbolizes freedom and direct contact with the living universe. 2. Setting of the outer Realm. The outer realm is the space within which you are working. It is your temple. The set up of your outer realm symbolizes the universe upon which you intend to operate. Be sure that you will not be disturbed in your work. Be sure the room where you are working is clean. You need an altar. A table will do. Arrange your ceremonial utensils as shown in the picture. Leave enough space for the candles and Rune staves which you use for the ceremonial. You may set a circle of Rune Staves around the table, large enough so you can move in this circle. Have the Runes EH and GIBOR on the left and right sides of the table, or altar. Have the Runes which you need for your ceremonial removed from the circle, and set it on the table in the space where you have the center of operations. Set the cup with water or wine on the table, the incense burner, one altar candle, Thor's Hammer, and the Rune dagger. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 3 Now, you are ready to set up the space within which you are going to work: your inner and outer Rune Realms. First, tune into each Rune in the circle, singing the stanza of the magical poem for each Rune. You may, instead, listen to the tape which establishes your inner Rune Realm, and connect each Rune of your inner Rune Realm with the corresponding Rune Stave in your outer Rune Realm. 3. Protective circle: Next, you take the Rune dagger or power rod. First you trace the circle of Rune Staves around the table, then you draw the HAGAL Rune in all four directions, beginning with North (the position of the FA Rune), next West (position of RIT), South (position of IS), then East, position of BAR. Each time you draw the Hagal Rune in the air, do so with the strongest possible imagination of protection and Oneness with the universe. Next, all participants stand up, with the imagination of cleansing, they position first MAN three times, then AR. Put the dagger back to the side of the incense burner. 4. Light Altar Candle and say: \"Forces of the Light Eternal in the universe, Penetrate darkness Sacred Flame, shine! Bring Light to the night! All around darkness All around night I amidst the Light Darkness had merge With the Light! Original fire of FA Burning since the beginning Of times Light Force of AR Born in the Sun At the beginning of the worlds Give Light to the seeker!\" 5. Light Incense and say: \"May the power of the Runes Lead us to a greater understanding Of the Universe and Ourselves!\" 6. Hold both hands over cup with water (or wine which is thinned with water). Be aware of the purpose of your ceremonial. Project the visualization of the result in the wine or water, if the purpose of the ceremonial is related to you personally. Otherwise know that the water element symbolizes emotional strength. Project energy into the water or wine. Then drink part of it. 7. Look at Thor's Hammer. Be aware that this is the symbol for your capability to draw, harness, and project Rune energies. Hold both hands over it, knowing of its power. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 3 Now, you finished all preparation and you are ready for your group practice of Rune Yoga. 8. Practice FA through KA, first body positions, then hand positions, and share experiences. 9. Practice Healing transfer with UR. First body position of UR and chant UR three times, in order to make this energy predominant within the circle. Next pair up and practice transfer. 10. You are ready to end the ceremony. You say \"Powers of the Runes Thank you for your energy Flow back to the Realms of Creation! 11. Imagine, or visualize, the Rune energies grounding, flowing into the ground, like water flows down a drain, or seeps into sandy soil. 12. Extinguish the flame of the Altar candle and extinguish the incense burner. 13. Chant IS three times, again with the imagination of grounding. 14. Remove all utensils. It will be good to practice the above exercises two to four times before you begin with the fourth lesson and send your progress report to receive your fifth lesson. You may practice other body positions. May the power of the Runes Bring you in contact with the realms of spirit And energize, heal, and balance Body, mind, and aura. 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 8 RUNE YOGA LESSON IV Welcome to your forth lesson in Rune Yoga. In the previous lessons you learned to draw Runic energies, and to direct them for healing and energizing. You have experienced that simple body positions, combined with other shape related practices, can generate and harness powerful energies. You also experienced the strength of group practices, where the group, too, adds to the overall shape energies. Some of you will have become aware of specific group energies, apart from and in conjunction with individual energies. Furthermore, you experienced the values of a ceremonial setting. In this lesson you will gain experiences of working with the spiritual centres of your body, the chakras. Let's go right into PRACTICE 1. Setting of the outer Realm. The outer realm is the space within which you are working. It is your temple. The set up of your outer realm symbolizes the universe upon which you intend to operate. Be sure that you will not be disturbed in your work. Be sure the room in which you are working is clean. You need an altar. A table will do. Arrange your ceremonial utensils as shown in the picture. Leave enough space for the candles and Rune staves which you use for the ceremonial. You may set a circle of Rune Staves around the table, large enough so you can move in this circle. Have the Runes EH and GIBOR on the left and right sides of the table, or altar. Have the Runes which you need for your ceremonial removed from the circle, and set it on the table in the space where you have the center of operations. Set the cup with water or wine on the table, the incense burner, one altar candle, Thor's Hammer, and the Rune dagger. Now, you are ready to set up the space within which you are going to work: your inner and outer Rune Realms. First, tune into each Rune in the circle, singing the stanza of the magical poem for each Rune. You may, instead, listen to the tape which establishes your inner Rune Realm and connect each Rune of your inner Rune Realm with the corresponding Rune Stave in your outer Rune Realm. 2. Protective circle: Next, you take the Rune dagger or power rod. First you trace the circle of Rune Staves around the table, then you draw the HAGAL Rune in all four directions, beginning with North (the position of the FA Rune), next West (position of RIT), South (position of IS), then East, position of BAR. Each time you draw the Hagal Rune in the air, do so with the strongest possible imagination of protection and Oneness with the universe. Next, all participants stand up, with the imagination of cleansing, they position first MAN three times, then AR. Put the dagger back to the side of the incense burner. 3. Light Altar Candle and say: \"Forces of the Light Eternal in the universe, Penetrate darkness! Sacred Flame, shine! Bring Light to the night' 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 8 All around darkness All around night I amidst the Light Darkness had merged With the Light! Original fire of FA Burning since the beginning Of times Light Force of AR Born in the Sun At the beginning of the worlds Give Light to the seeker!\" 4. Light Incense and say: \"May the power of the Runes Lead us to a greater understanding Of the Universe and Ourselves!\" 5. Hold both hands over cup with water (or wine which is thinned with water). Be aware of the purpose of your ceremonial. Project the visualization of the result in the wine or water, if the purpose of the ceremonial is related to you personally. Otherwise know that the water element symbolizes emotional strength. Project energy into the water or wine. Then drink part of it. 6. Look at Thor's Hammer. Be aware that this is the symbol for your capability to draw, harness, and project Rune energies. Hold both hands over it, knowing of its power. Now, you finished all preparation and you are ready for your group practice of Rune Yoga. 7. Participants in circle. Focus on your crown chakra. Body Position of HAGAL. Chant HAGAL three times. Hand Position of HAGAL. While inhaling, chant HAGAL. At the same time, feel energy come into your crown chakra. 8. Focus on your eye chakra. Body Position of HAGAL. Chant HAGAL three times. Hand Position of HAGAL. While inhaling, chant HAGAL. At the same time, feel energy come into your eye chakra. 9. Focus on your throat chakra. Body Position of HAGAL. Chant HAGAL three times. Hand Position of HAGAL. While inhaling, chant HAGAL. At the same time, feel energy come into your throat chakra. 10 Focus on your heart chakra. Body Position of HAGAL. Chant HAGAL three times. Hand Position of HAGAL. While inhaling, chant HAGAL. At the same time, feel energy come into your heart chakra. 11. Focus on your solar plexus. Body Position of HAGAL. Chant HAGAL three times. Hand Position of HAGAL. While inhaling, chant HAGAL. At the same time, feel energy come into your solar plexus. 12. Focus on your spleen chakra. Body Position of HAGAL. Chant HAGAL three times. Hand Position of HAGAL. While inhaling, chant HAGAL. At the same time, feel energy come into your 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 8 spleen chakra. 13. Focus on your root chakra. Body Position of HAGAL. Chant HAGAL three times. Hand Position of HAGAL. While inhaling, chant HAGAL. At the same time, feel energy come into your root chakra. Go into a brief meditation, then share experiences. It will be good to repeat this practice two to four times in the following days. 14. Everybody in a circle. Better, forming the HAGAL Rune. Whoever wants special attention to one or more of his/her chakras sits in the middle. Hand Position of UR. Chant UR three times. Then, breathing technique (correlate breathing) and while inhaling, chant mentally UR while you visualize energies of UR coming through your hand into your solar plexus. Point palm or fingers of other hand to chakra of the person in the middle, while exhaling, imagine the energies of UR projected through yout other arm into the chakra of person in the middle. 15. Same exercise, this time energize chakra (for the beginning, I recommend the eye chakra or the root chakra) Give everybody a chance of receiving Runic energies. The person in the middle may either draw the energies consciously, i.e. Inhale and draw while others exhale and project, or remain in meditative, receptive position. 16. You are ready to end the ceremony. You say \"Powers of the Runes Thank you for your energy Flow back to the Realms of Creation!\" 17. Imagine, or visualize, the Rune energies grounding, flowing into the ground, like water flows down a drain, or seeps into sandy soil. 18. Extinguish the flame of the Altar candle. 19. Extinguish the incense burner. 20. Chant IS three times, again with the imagination of grounding. 21. Remove all utensils. It will be good to practice the above exercises two to four times before you begin with the fifth lesson and send your progress report to receive your sixth lesson. May the power of the Runes Bring you in contact with the realms of creation And energize, heal, and balance your chakras. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 5 RUNE YOGA LESSON V Welcome to the fifth letter of instructions of Rune Yoga. While in letter #4 we focussed on ourselves by balancing our chakras, this fifth letter introduces us to energies that we perceive as external. In many metaphysical systems, there is mention of life energy. Life energy is explained as the kind of force that is at the basis of life, or, at least, is found in conjunction with living organisms. Like energies belonging to the electromagnetic spectrum, life energies are considered to be everywhere in the living universe. Hindoo philosophy refers to life energies as Prana. The Eastern Yoga developed specific methods of directing and using Prana. In the pacific, it is refered to as \"Mana\", carrier of psychic energies and life. There, too, specific methods were developed to direct and use Mana. In Western metaphysical and scientific systems, life force is described with many different labels. Scientists studied these energies under many various aspects. (see www.magitech. com for updated info) For your practice you will develop a model of life energies that will prove to be very useful. For an in depth understanding of these energies, it is helpful that you look at a few historic developments in the scientific understanding and use of life energies. One of the early pioneers of a scientific understanding of those energies was Franz Anton Mesmer, a medical doctor from Stuttgart, Germany, who lived 200 years ago. He discovered an energy that he thought to be emanating from the hands. He labeled this force \"animal magnetism.\" Mesmer developed methods of healing with passes of the hands along the body, at a distance of 1 to 3 inches. In our days his methods are still practiced by thousands of professional healers, or \"magnetiseurs\" in France. PRACTICE I People pair up. One person sits in a comfortable position in a chair, or lies down. Preferably relaxed. However, relaxing is not necessary because the application of life energies will relax. Next, the other person makes magnetic passes along the body of the first. The palm of the right hand is facing the body of the person to be magnetized. Always make the magnetic strokes coming from the extremities toward the center of the body. When the center of the body is reached, then withdraw the hand in an upward movement, and lower it again at the end from where you begin again the pass toward the center. Move slowly. Allow ae to 40 seconds for each pass. You may apply \"animal magnetism\" to any part of the body. Proceed slowly. Feel the flow of energies when receiving energy and when projecting it. As a next practice, consciously PROJECT energies from your right hand toward the body of the person whom you magnetize. Also, begin to draw energy through your left hand and then project it out through your right hand, palm open and facing the body of the receiving person. 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 5 Next, you practice a Runic hand position with your left hand. First FA to energize, then UR to strengthen, etc. Again push through your right hand which makes the passes. Both partners feel the specific energetic feeling for each Rune they practice. At the end of the practice, both persons ground with Is. Vicious attacks from his less capable and less successful colleagues of the medical profession led Mesmer to leave Vienna and to move to Paris. He went on to research animal magnetism and soon developed another useful device: a barrel filled with iron filings from which iron rods protruded. People who wanted to be energized with life energies (animal magnetism) held on to those iron rods to draw life energies. The effects of this energetic charge were quite dramatic. Miraculous cures were observed which, again, drew the envy of Mesmerâs medical colleagues who were less fortunate with their rather limited skills. Today we know that those barrels were Orgone accumulators (accumulators of life energies) and that Mesmerâs animal magnetism was the same thing as Orgone, the life energy discovered and put to practical use by Wilhelm Reich. Mesmer was the first person we know of who invented and built a functioning orgone accumulator. Movement of the hand over the surface of the body is actually intensifying the energetic fields of life energies in the body. Use of life energies is a very important facet in your practice of Rune Yoga. In order to make a very effective use of those energies, we have to develop a picture, or mapping, of those energies which will prove useful to our practice. First, we have to establish how those life energies fit our universe as we experience it. A metaphysical model of the universe incorporating life energies will be most useful for our work with life energies in combination with Runic energies from the realms of creation. Perhaps you are familiar with the metaphysical mapping of the universe which accepts four planes, each of which relates to one of the elements: to the fire element the highest plane, the world of emanation, or the sphere of will. Next the mental sphere, world of creation, relating to the air element. Next the astral sphere, world that relates to emotions and the water element. Last the sphere of consciousness-matter, which relates to the earth element. The material world is subdivided into two parts: the dense-material plane and the etheric plane. Again, I have to point out that in this case we deal with mappings of the consciousness, the sole purpose of which is usefulness for our methods of working with life energiesâ Whether this mapping is accepted by \"academia\" or not is irrelevant when considering this purpose. On the dense-material plane we arrange that which we experience as \"tangible\", while the etheric plane contains the most primal energies: electric and magnetic. What we call \"electric\" belongs to the electromagnetic spectrum: heat, light, radiation, etc. What we call \"magnetic\" is what we experience as raw life energy: orgone, chi, prana, mana, odic force, animal magnetism, Solar ether, whatever the name. As we go to higher planes, we find again many energies of a higher order, astral energies, mental energies, and will related energies. Planetary energies, for instance, are complex 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 5 energies which relate to all planes: mostly astral and mental, but also components that reach into the etheric planes. Orgone energy, or animal magnetism, are raw life energies belonging to the etheric plane. Odic energy, on the other hand (discovered by Baron von Reichenbach) has some direction: Besides being the raw life energy of the etheric plane, it has also relation to the astral and mental worlds. As such, Odic energy gives direction to the raw life energy. In our practice exercise, we first drew and projected simply life energy. Both, Franz Anton Mesmer and Wilhelm Reich devised machines to accumulate this energy from where living beings can draw it. We may have a barrel with iron filings and draw with our left hand from the protruding iron rod, or we may draw from the opening of a Reichian Orgone accumulator, or we may just draw from our surroundings (which draw would be not as intense, of course), and then project this energy upon ourselves or someone else. The second part of our exercise consisted of programming the Orgone and actually developing Odic energy. We programmed Runes into the Orgone (life energy) and thus made this life energy charged and modified with energies from the realms of creation for very specific action: Fa to initiate, to activate; UR to strengthen, etc., depending on the Runic correlations with body functions and life functions (see letter * 1). I mentioned that life energies can be accumulated (even generated) with some specific devices. We can go one step further and generate specific Odic energies with devices. An ideal device to generate Odic energies is a Runic circle which is made up of crystals. The advantage of devices, of course, is to maximize the effects and intensity of Odic energy at the same time as the personal effort is minimized. Like every technical device, it is designed to save time and effort for riumans. Crystals, pyramids of various, Rune Crystal grids, and other arrangements can allow you to be more and more specific with the energies you want to generate. RUNE YOGA, on the other hand, ALLOWS YOU TO COMBINE LIFE ENERGIES WITH ENERGIES FROM THE REALMS OF CREATION AT ANY TIME. The ceremonial setting which you use when practicing Rune Yoga, as well as group arrangements, are useful additions, not found in other major Yoga systems. PRACTICE II Set Your Rune circle, ideally with a set of crystal Runes. At least, take a center crystal. Put the Rune UR (strengthening and healing) on the center crystal. Everybody stands up, chant UR three times (or nine tines) while making the handposition of UR with the left hand and projecting the energies in the center of the Runic circle to energize the UR on the center crystal. This way, the \"atmosphere\" in the practice room is charged with the Odic energy of UR. Now practice energy transfer as metnionned in the first practice of this lesson: magnetizing passes over the body of another person. As an alternative, draw UR with the left, project UR with the right upon another person. First one to one, then several people project upon one person. As with all other practice, always share experiences afterwards. Sharing and exchanging 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 5 ideas is very important, because it helps establishing familiarity with the energies you are working with. End the practice by grounding with IS 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 6 RUNE YOGA LESSON VI Welcome to the sixth letter of instructions of Rune Yoga. While in letter #4 you focused on yourself by balancing your chakras, this sixth letter introduces you to practices of awakening and developing your chakras. If you want to know more about the chakras, or spiritual centres, in your body, I suggest that you read \"Theories of the chakras\" by Hiroshi Motoyama, Ledbetters classic book on the chakras, or others. While the typical exercises to awaken chakras are are rather lengthy processes, Runic practice allows us to get results at a rather rapid rate, especially when the work is done within the framework and structure of group practices. Considering the amazing results that have been achieved in group practices, it is truly amazing that so little group dynamics are used in traditional chakra work. The use of energies from the realms of creation, the Runes, in awakening and developing your chakras is of great benefit. Not only are those spiritualâpsychic processes speeded up, but Runes also provide the chakras with an added sensitivity which is in line with the general charactreristics of the Rune. In principle every Rune can be used for every chakra. However, some Runes may show more affinity with some specific chakras: FA is great for the root chakra at the base of the spine, or for the crown chakra. FA may also be used for the eye chakra, especially in those instances where the eye chakra is used to \"draw\" Kundalini. UR works well with the spleen chakra and with the eye chakra. Of course, UR may be used anywhere where strengthening or calming are indicated. THORN is kin to the solar plexus and the the throat chakra. It is good to project energies of any chakra. OS, on the other hand is good to receive energies into the chakras, and it is kin to the heart chakra. RIT works well with the throat chakra and solar plexus. It it kin to the \"rotating energies\" of the chakras. It is ceremonial projection KA relates to the eye chakra and to the spleen chakra (magical capabilities that are attributed to the spleen). HAGAL relates to all chakras, to the chakras as a group of seven, it has also a balancing effect on the chakras. HAGPL, projected on the crown chakra, awakens the whole system, while balancing the chakras from the crown down, one after the other. The effect of techniques connected with this practice is very powerful, capable of eliminating many blockages which 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 6 individuals are subjected to. Once connected with the crown chakra, it develops pulsating streams between crown and root chakras, encompassing all other chakras. NOD relates to the eye and spleen chakras. It can be used to release karmic structures which are locked up in the chakras, and therefore can be a powerful catalyst in the development of any chakra. For those initiates (Rune Masters) who are more advanced in Runic practice, NOD is a key to reworking karmic structures. IS, again, is very universal. It aligns the spine, and can function as an \"axis\" that connect all chakras, as well as it can serve as an \"axis\" that connects all chakras of a group. Is has affinities with the throat chakra and solar plexus. AR relates to the heart chakra, a \"stable heat\" and the \"Solar fires\" within. SIG works with the throat chakra and solar plexus. TYR is related to the eye and spleen chakras. It adds spirit of selfâsacrifice for a purpose. BAR has an overall calming effect, it is ideal to put chakras to rest, to bring them to an absolute calm which, in itself, gives the purity of an environment from which new action may develop: action which is unencumbered by things taken over from happenings before. BAR relates to the crown chakra and the root chakra, from both of which BARâs absolute calm can spread best. LAF is the power of law of life, natural spiritual law, as expressed by the recognizing third eye (eye chakra) and the magically active spleen chakra. MAN is spiritual power: projected through the solar plexus and throat chakra. MAN draws spiritual power \"from the crowns of the world tree\" through the spine, down through the crown chakra, empowering all chakras all the way down to the root chakra. YR, on the other hand, draws the energy of the roots of the world tree through the root chakra all the way into manifestation in the realms of spirit. Needless to say, YR has a strong affinity with the heart chakra, where all the forces come to a rest, ready to radiate outward in rays of energy which is not confined by spaceâtime or any other dimensional limitations. EH relates to the solar plexus and throat chakra. It unifies opposites into one whole which is essentially more than the sum total of its components. The crown is the roots, and in this union, crown and roots are a new, essentially more evolved, being, with its gravitational center in the heart chakra. EH and NOD unify into HAGAL which, in turn, is the \"mother\" of all Runes. GIBOR is all in to the eye chakra and to the spleen chakra. It is the world crystal in motion, which encompasses all chakras and all Runes. The above are but a few hints which can be the basis for years of practice and spiritual experience. It shows one of the many strata of a Runic symbolism which transcends the typical structures of symbolisms as we know it. It shows how the world crystal, expressed by the hexagon with the three inscribed diameters, relates to the chakras. Once you understand those relations, then you know why Runes are such a powerful help in developing your chakras. 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 6 Now, letâs continue with PRACTICE This practice is set up for a group. You may practice by yourself, of course, but you will learn of the importance of group work: perhaps an incentive to either join a group or to create a group by giving classes of Rune Yoga. In general, the better the setting, the stronger will be the group energies or personally generated energies. Therefore, it is advisable to follow accurately the instructions given. 1. Setting of the outer Realm. The outer realm is the space within which you are working. It is your temple. The set up of your outer realm symbolizes the universe upon which you intend to operate. Be sure that you will not be disturbed in your work. Be sure the room in which you are working is clean. You need an altar. A table may do. Arrange your ceremonial utensils as shown in the picture. Leave enough space for the candles and Rune staves which you use for the ceremonial. You may set a circle of Rune Staves around the table, large enough so you can move in this circle. For this type energy work, crystal staves are much better than wooden staves. Have the Runes EH and GIBOR on the left and right sides of the table, or altar. Have the Runes which you need for your ceremonial removed from the circle, and set it on the table in the space where you have the center of operations. Set the cup with water or wine on the table, the incense burner, one altar candle, Thorâs Hammer, and the Rune dagger. Now, you are ready to set up the space within which you are going to work: your inner and outer Rune Realms. First, tune into each Rune in the circle, singing the stanza of the magical poem for each Rune. You may, instead, listen to the tape which establishes your inner Rune Realm, and connect each Rune of your inner Rune Realm with the corresponding Rune Stave in your outer Rune Realm. 2. Protective circle: Next, you take the Rune dagger or power rod. First you trace the circle of Rune Staves around the table, then you draw the HAGAL Rune in all four directions, beginning with North (the position of the FA Rune), next West (position of RIT), South (position of IS), then East, position of BAR. Each time you draw the Hagal Rune in the air, do so with the strongest possible imagination of protection and Oneness with the universe. Next, all participants stand up, with the imagination of cleansing, they position first MAN three times, then AR. Put the dagger back to the side of the incense burner. 3. Light Altar Candle and say: \"Powers of the Light Eternal in the universe, Penetrate darkness! Sacred Flame, shine! Bring Light to the night! All around darkness All around night I amidst the Light Darkness had merged With the Light! 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 6 Original fire of FA Burning since the beginning Of times Light Force of AR Born in the Sun At the beginning of the worlds Give Light to the seeker!\" 4. Light Incense and say: \"May the power of the Runes Lead us to a greater understanding Of the Universe and Ourselves!\" 5. Hold both hands over cup with water (or wine which is thinned with water). Be aware of the purpose of your ceremonial. Project the visualization of the result wine or water, if the purpose of the ceremonial is to you personally. Otherwise know that the water symbolizes emotional strength. Project energy water or wine. Then drink part of it. 6. Look at Thorâs Hammer and be aware of your capability to draw and project energies. Now you finished all preparation and you are ready for your chakra practice. 7. Participants in circle. Focus on your crown chakra. Body Position of HAGAL. Chant HAGAL three times. Hand Position of HAGAL. While inhaling, chant HAGAL. At the same time, feel energy come into your crown chakra. 8. Now, focus on your eye chakra. Body Position of FA. Chant FA three times. Hand Position of FA. While inhaling, chant FA mentally. At the same time, feel energy come into your eye chakra. Repeat nine times. Meditate briefly (two to three minutes) and share experiences. 9. Pair up. One person proceeds as outlined above (8). The other person draws FA with the left hand and, with the right hand, projects the energies of FA into the eye chakra of the partner (see practices of projecting in lesson #2). 10. Practice the same with other Runes and with other chakras. 11. Two or more persons project one (or more) Runes into one chakras of a person. This should only be done only under supervision of a initiated Rune Master who may ground the energies when need arises. 12. (only under supervision of a initiated Rune Master who may ground the energies when need arises) Participants of the group form a Rune. Person who receives is outside the structure of the group Rune (or may be part of it). Energies are projected on receiving person. Meditate and share experiences. Give all participants a chance to receive Runic energies. Note: If you are a group, you may set up a calendar and a plan to work with all chakras. 13. Whenever you are ready to end the ceremony, you say: 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 6 \"Powers of the Runes Thank you for your energy Flow back to the Realms of Creation!\" 14. Imagine, or visualize, the Rune energies grounding, flowing into the ground, like water flows down a drain, or seeps into sandy soil. 15. Extinguish the flame of the Altar candle. 16. Extinguish the incense burner. 17. Chant IS three times, again with the imagination of grounding. 18. Remove all utensils. It will be good to practice the above exercises two to four times before you begin with the seventh lesson and send your progress report to receive your eighth lesson. May the power of the Runes Bring you in contact with the realms of creation And energize, awaken, and develop your chakras. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 7 RUNE YOGA LESSON VII Welcome to the seventh letter of instructions of Rune Yoga. In this letter, I will focus on the side of Rune Yoga which brings about spiritual experiences and insights. You are going to use meditational triggers for this purpose. Again, the group can project Runic energies on one (or more) persons who are the center of focus and who transform those energies into spiritual or mystical experiences. This same method may be used for readings. This would be a direct Runic reading without necessarily using staves. Now, letâs begin with the PRACTICE Spiritual Experience of the Crown of the Worldtree 1. Arrange your altar: cup, candle, incense burner, dagger or powerrod. Circle of Runes around yourself or on altar (the latter projects a protective circle around the group). Candle in the center of the circle. 2. Personal preparation: clean yourself, wear your robe, or clean clothes, or practice nude, according to your background. In any case, be in tune with the living universe. 3. Tune into your inner Rune Realm. Align the inner Rune Realms of the group by leading a meditative focus of the inner Rune Realm. 4. Establish the outer Rune Realm. Take Rune dagger, or power rod, trace Rune circle around you, then draw the NASAL Rune in all four directions, beginning with North (position of FA Rune), next West, South, and East. Each time you draw the NASAL Rune, do so with the strongest possible imagination of protection and Oneness with the Universe. 5. Light the altar candle and say: \"Forces of the Light Eternal in the universe, Penetrate darkness! Sacred flame, shine! Bring light to the night! All around darkness All around night I amidst the Light Darkness is penetrated By the light. Light candle in center and say: Original fire of FA Burning from the roots Of times Light force of AR Born in the Sun 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 7 At the roots of the worlds, Give Light to the seeker(s)!\" 6. Light incense and say: \"May the power of the Runes Lead me (us) to a greater understanding Of the universe and myself (ourselves) \" 7. Hold both hands over the cup with water (or wine which is thinned with water). Project the energies of MAN into the cup. Drink part of the water (or wine). 8. Look at Thorâs Hamuer. Be aware that this brings your consciousness in tune with the Rune MAN. Hold both hands over it, knowing of its power. 9. Body position of MAN Look at the stave of MAN Visualize MAN Sing: \"mmaaaaaaaannnnnn Rune of MAN Unfold within me (us) The powers of the Divine Insights. Sacred MAN, inspire me (us) Sacred MAN, make me (us) spiritual Awaken in me (us) Universal Wisdom, Universal Love. Sacred Man, Rune of spirit In original Light Man is One. 10. Sit down, keep eyes closed, remain in meditation for several minutes. From time to time, mentally chant MAN, while drawing its energies into yourself. If you lead a group, have the group do the following: Body position of MAN Look at the stave of MAN Visualize MAN Sing: \"mmmmaaaaaaaannnnnn Symbol of ascent 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 7 Crown of the world tree Symbol of mankind I am open To the influxus Of spiritual power And Odic energies Which pulsate In the universe. Many other meditations are possible here. 11. After your meditation, conclude the ritual by grounding the energies: Position of IS (grounding) Look at stave of IS Visualize IS Sing: \"iiiiiiiiiiiiissssssssss Powers of MAN Thank you for your energies Flow back to the Realms of Creationâ\" 12. Imagine, or visualize, the energies grounding, flowing into the ground, through your body, like water flows down a drain, or seeps into sandy soil. 13. Extinguish the candles and incense burner. 14. Remove all utensils. OTHER FORMULAS FOR MED ITATION Similar to MAN, you may meditate on other Runes. The ceremonial with other Runes is similar to the ceremonial described above. For extra strength, you may expand the ceremonial, and energize your inner Rune Realm as well as your outer Rune Realm. The formulas that follow may be used to substitute in steps (9) and (10) above. Be CREATIVE in setting up the specific meditations. The student of the Basic Rune Course can also use some of the materials which are contained in the Rune Songs. Here a few formulas for meditation connected with specific Runes and which may help you set up specific formulas for spiritual or mystic experiences: FA \"Create your good luck in FA, and you will have it.\" \"The original fire, this high universal force, creates a higher selfâconsciouness within myself.\" 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 7 \"Original Creative Force of Nature streams through me.

The set up is similar as above, but I consider it helpful to give you again the full step by step instructions. 1. Arrange your altar: cup, candle, incense burner, dagger of powerrod. Circle of Runes around yourself or on altar (the latter projects a protective circle around the group). Candle in the center of the circle. 2. Personal preparation: clean yourself, wear your robe, or clean clothes, or practice nude, according to your background. In any case, be in tune with the living universe. 3. Tune into your inner Rune Realm. Align the inner Rune Realms of the group by leading a meditative focus of the inner Rune Realm. 4. Establish the outer Rune Realm. Take Rune dagger, or power rod, trace Rune circle around you, then draw the HAGAL Rune in all four directions, beginning with North (position of FA Rune), next West, South, and East.

In the previous letter, I focused on the side of Rune Yoga that causes spiritual experiences and insights and you learned about readings where Runic energies are used in a direct manner without the usual casting of Runes. In this letter of instructions I will teach you to expand this latter procedure. You will learn how to tune into karmic structures, how to give karmic readings, and how to bring positive change to the structuring of karma. The ceremonial setting is similar to what has been done in the previous lesson. The focus, however, will be on other Runes. The following is a typical group exercise which requires group energies. If a group is not available, you may still do the works with \"invisible participants,\" similar to \"invisible playmates\" of children. Call upon some spiritual guides, masters, angels, or other entities which you know halpful for the purpose. For Knights of Runes connecting with the time-less brotherhood of Rune Masters is helpful. PRACTICE In the following you practice a karmic reading and karmic adjustment in which the energies are triggered by the group. 1. Arrange your altar: cup, candle, incense burner, dagger or powerrod. Circle of Runes around yourself or on altar (the latter projects a protective circle around the group). 2. Personal preparation: clean yourself, wear your robe, or clean clothes, or practice nude, depending on your background. In any case, be in tune Mith tne living uni verse. 3. Tune into your inner Rune Realm. Align the inner Rune Realms of the group by leading a meditative focus of the inner Rune Realm. 4. Establish the outer Rune Realm. Take Rune dagger, or power rod, trace Rune circle around you, then draw the HPGPL Rune in all four directions, beginning with North (position of Ffl Rune), next West. South, and East. Each time you draw the HPGPL Rune, do so with the strongest possible imagination of protection and Oneness with the Universe. 5. Light the altar candle and everybody says: \"Forces of the Light Eternal in the universe, Penetrate darkness Sacred flame, shine! Bring light to the night!

By now, you know that Rune Yoga not only helps you to develoo individually in many ways, but it also helps develop a group spirit which, in turn, adds to your personal and individual development. This interaction, enhanced by ceremonial settings, develops a consciousness of being connected with the universe. Â£ mentioned earlier the main difference between cabbalisticâastrological systems which ~re based on structures of our Solar system and the Runic symbolisms which are more universal. While cabbalistic-based symbolisms are well defined and belonging to the realms of that which is created, Runic and related symbolisms are defining and coming from the realms of that which creates. Both symbolisms have their specific values and uses within the framework of our Solar system. To actually exactly determine a specific trend, or situation, some kind of astrological or cabbalistic structure is needed, whether it is used consciously or whether it simply there by implication. On the other hand, a shaoeârelated symbolism from the realms of creation, such as the symbolism of the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes, is an excellent basis to modify planetary trends when need arises. Here I touch upon technologies which are taught in the intermediate course of Runic practice. Being aware of this universality of Runic energies, or energies from the realms of creation, it should become obvious to you that Runes are an excellent help to modify the trends of destiny of our planet as a whole. fl demon in the planetary spheres can only manifest on this planet if it has, as a counterpart or focal point of action a demon within human beings â individuals, groups, nations, or the planet as a whole. The same counts for the beneficial energies of the zodiac. You should never forget that the HOECs (Higher Order Energy Complexes) which make up the structure of the astrological zodiac are NEUTRPL in their value. Ethical considerations of good and evil are a human outlook which is USEFUL for human advancement, spiritual and otherwise. Humans decide â tradividually and collectively âwhat energy fields of HOECs they relate to and how they relate to those trends. In other words, the effects of the zodiacal HOECs as determined by astrologers are a product of collective kar~c structuring. Now, it should be obvious to you why it takes energies from the realms of creation to change the perceived nature and impact of specific HOECs on mankind. As an example: Many effects of the outer planets are perceived and experienced negatively by most humans of our times. flstrologers say that is so because most humans are \"not evolved to the degree which is necessary to tune into the finer vibrations of those planets. Even though those good people emphasize the outer planets for the individual human being, we need to take a closer look at flLL planets when deciding about impact on the planet as a whole. Much of the individual \"good\" delivered by Jupiter and Venus may be detrimental to the planet. The use of energies from the realms of creation allows us to modify the interaction between zodiacal HOECs and mankind. Changing the EFFECT of planetary trends is a means of changing the destiny of the planet. Energies from the realms of creation allow to develop an OVERPLL BENEFICIPL ENERGYFIELD which smoothly adjusts this interaction between the planet and the constantly changing HOECs that permeate the planet. Such adjustment can make this planet a more spiritual place and a better place to live. Such adjustment is more efective than tackling each one of the myriads of problems individually without changing the basic structure, which would be a task reminding us of the efforts of Sisyphos in a Greek myth who, as a punishment, pushes a heavy rock up a mountain which slips and falls back down every time he thinks he is close to the top. Every human being has a responsibility to clean up the mess he or she helped create. To modify HOECs means to modify karma: individual karma and collective karma. The more people qet involved in this process of creation, the stronger the results. Pgain, your practice of Rune Yoga makes you aware of the importance of group work. 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Rune Yoga Lesson 9 This time, however, the group work is on a global scale, within a planetary framework. Projecting healing energies on the planet as a whole will energize the global energies of the planet and the return to the individual will be very strong and at a essentially higher level. It compares to a multidimensional vortex of energy developed as a result of inteaction of a group of groups of groups...( HOECs) The following Runes are especially well suited for this work and at this level of action: the group of MAN, YR, and HAGAL, the group of NOD, EH, and HAGAL, the group of AR, KA, and HAGAL, and the group of FA, OS, and GIBOR. Use the ceremonial outlines shown in the previous lessons and practice a Rune Yoga ceremony with your group (or by yourself). Be aware of the Rune realms joined in the group and the group realm joined into the planetary realms. Ps you practice as a group, you will more and more develop your participation into a yoga on a planetary level. With a large enough group, you will position the Runes as a mroup, and direct the energies which are generated toward the planetary destiny. You will be amazed of how positive projection of this kind reverts to you, since you helped create a better environment of HOECs for the planet. The benefits of such actions are often felt immediately. PRACTICE In the following you practice a ceremony of achieving ONENESS with the realm of creation. Such Oneness, or identification, enhances your consciousness of being a significant part of the universe and it increases your capabilities of working with the energies of creation and creatively act upon your universe and the planet. 1. Arrange your altar: cup, candle, incense burner, dagger or powerrod. Circle of Runes around yourself or on altar (the latter projects a protective circle around the group). Candle in the center of the circle. 2. Personal preparation: clean yourself, wear your robe, or clean clothes, or practice nude, according to your background. In any case, be in tune with the living universe. 3. Tune into your inner Rune Realm. Align the inner Rune Realms of the group by leading a meditative focus of the inner Rune Realm. Plign the group realm with the Realms of Creat ion. 4. Establish the outer Rune Realm. Take Rune dagger, or power rod, trace Rune circle around you, then draw the HAGAL Rune in all four directions, beginning with North (position of FA Rune), next West, South, and East. Each time you draw the HAGAL Rune, do so with the strongest possible imagination of protection and Oneness with the Universe. 5.

In other words, specific shapes can trigger their energies. Shapes, in this respect, are to be understood in a very general way. The first thing which comes into the mind when we talk about shapes, is no doubt the graphic outline of a Rune. Another shape is the mantra, which is a shape of sound. As you will learn soon, Mantras can be sung in many variations, which helps you experience the various shades of Runic energies. Similarly, you can add the shapes of \"color\" to the Runic symbol, or environments. In the above, we showed you two extremes of shapes: first the graphic outline, then the sound. Those shapes may be combined, of course, which adds to the potentials of your Runic practice. One realm of shapes, which is closely connected with, often derived from, the graphic outline of Runes, are hand-and body positions of Runes. When posing those, something from the purely graphic outline is lost, no doubt. However, if you consider the conductivity of energy of the human body, then much is gained. Hand and body positions add extremely valuable dimensions to your Runic practice. Especially when those positions are practiced in a ceremonial set-up, by several persons, each person perhaps representing one specific Rune, or several persons forming one single Rune. On this web site I am showing you the basic hand and body positions of Runes. 1"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"rune magick positions THE RUNE FA BODYPOSITION: Standing upright, feet together, both arms pointing upward in an angle of approximately 30 degrees from horizontal line.

WHY IT IS A GOOD THING FOR YOU TO STUDY AND PRACTICE RUNES The SYMBOLISM of the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes gives you ACCESS TO THE REALMS OF CREATION. THEREFORE... If you are a PRACTICING PSYCHIC who uses psychic capabilities to help others, Runic practice will add an invaluable new dimension to your profession. If you are an ASTROLOGER, READER, or COUNSELOR, Runic practice can bring you beyond the status of a mere bystander. No loner are you limited to just telling your clients what trends are in store for them and, perhaps, how they may adjust. Now you can actively work on your clients' destinies and help straighten out their lives. This added capability ensures repeat business and better reward. If you are a LECTURER or TEACHER of metaphysics or if you study to become one, knowledge of Runic practice will add to your classes. Especially the teaching of Rune Yoga is very rewarding, since its effects will be felt immediately by the majority of your students. If you are involved in the HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS, Rune Yoga and Runic energy treatment (using the energies of the world crystal) will increase the scope of your methods available. 11"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"rune magick positions If you are SEEKING ENLIGHTENMENT, Runes are one of the fastest and safest ways to deep mystical experiences, to insights in the workings of the universe and to experience on Oneness.
