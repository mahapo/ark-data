However, many persons who became seriously interested in the ancient art of harnessing cosmic energies from the realms of the Runes must soon realize that scarcely anything tangible was known in the English speaking world. This unfortunate situation was well reflected on the shelves of metaphysical bookstores. Until quite recently, there was virtually no book available where the serious student could find any information about the esoteric aspects of Runes let alone practical suggestions on how to harness the incredible powers that come forth from the realms of the Runes. Today it is possible to find many more books about Runes. The authors of these books usually limit themselves to discussing Rune readings and divination with possibly a few hints on how to use Runes in other ways: most of them are unashamedly materialistic. Some of them indulge in reveries about reviving the old Odinistic religion. Unfortunately, it is also true that none of these well-meant works have as their foundation the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes, which are based on the hexagon with its three inscribed diameters. In these books, you will find discussions of arrays of 20, 24, or even more \"Runes\" which have little to do with the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes. More than one author even includes a newly invented blank \"Rune\" in his system. The blank rune, of course, was unknown to true runic tradition. These arrays of \"Runes\" certainly cannot be symbolisms, since they have none of the criteria of a true symbolism. In a true symbolism, the position of each symbol in relation to every other symbol is of key importance. When no such interrelation exists, we speak of an \"incoherent array\" of symbols. The original 18 Sacred Futhork Runes were a system of mantra sounds connected with symbols. Some present day researchers would say that Runes are a system of archetypal symbols. No doubt from the very first these symbols were used as triggers that gave access to cosmic energies when properly used. In fact, there is not a corresponding Rune for every sound that the language could produce. This probably points to the fact that Runes were originally used for sacred purposes only, not as an alphabet. At a much later date, Runes were used to write names, short messages and Rune Stones. The Vikings of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden preferred to write with the sacred symbols alone rather than develop a common script, even though their sacred symbols did not include all the sounds in their language. It seems that the symbols were rooted in a much older tradition of the Atlantean North, possibly a reminder of a very old global tradition. Those Vikings did not invent new symbols to accommodate their linguistic needs. It seems that they were aware of the initiatory character of the Runic symbolism. After the Vikings had expanded into England, Iceland, Greenland, Northern Canada, Russia, Normandy, Sicily, and many other countries, some new developments led to the introduction of extra symbols, as well as to the concealing of the old symbolism. New conquests brought contacts with different languages, and some of the new sounds were provided with new symbols to render them more accurately. Because of these inventions some 30 or more local runic alphabets were developed. Another cogent reason for the introduction of new letters and the distortion or omission of the older ones lay in the religious situation of the time. The Vikings were the last people who had Runes as an integral part of their religious system. At the time of the expansion, the socio-economic structure of the Viking peoples changed significantly. It was then that the Vikings came in contact with the relatively young and extremely fanatic Christian religion. 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Rune Magick Book - Introduction The Christian religion is the only religion that has never allowed any \"pockets\" of other religions within its own domain. It is a matter of historical observation that the main stream religion of a people reflects its socio-economic structure. If the socio-economic circumstances change, the structure of the religion changes as well. Some change would have occurred in Viking society even without the impact of the Christian religion. It is also a matter of observed historical fact that whenever there are two or more religions competing within a changing society that religion is victorious which most accurately reflects the socio-economic structure of the people. The old religion had no chance for final victory, though the struggle lasted for centuries. Some 15 million people were killed, burned, and tortured, all others were intimidated by the followers of the religion that managed to acquire overwhelming political power and pushed the old religion almost completely out of existence. As a standard procedure, the followers of the new religion condemned the runic system merely because it was part of the old religion. Some of them however, many of them priests, knew well of the powers inherent in the system, and of its potential to help them attain their political and religious goals. These people tried to get hold of the Runic knowledge even while they publicly condemned all those who used the Runes. Indeed at the same time as King Olaf of Norway had been persuaded to kill all the Rune masters in his country, and destroy the standing Rune Stones, there were Christian priests who were trying to get the inner Knowledge for the Church, and for themselves. Olaf was made a saint by the Church for his role as a destroyer of knowledge and executioner of the wise. It was to prevent misuse by such unworthy and ruthless people that Rune masters decided to protect the original symbolism by adding new symbols and changing old ones. As a result, only initiated persons were able to understand the system and to use the Runes with success. For those who lacked the proper background work with the new arrays of symbols became ineffective or even hazardous, for as Egil Skallagrimsson wrote, warning the ignorant: \"Runes should a man not score Unless he knows them very well.\" (Egil's Saga) Since true Runic traditions are lacking in the English-speaking world, most modern metaphysical writers in this country are still confused about the true Runic symbolism and the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes. This confusion is more than unfortunate when we consider the fact that many of the Rune students, who try to use the Runes magically by following the scanty hints available in current publications, expose themselves to unnecessary difficulties. Ignorance is not a safeguard against improper use of the Runes. When somebody touches a high voltage wire, it does not matter what he believes about electricity, or what he knows about electricity. The laws of Nature are not respecting ignorant persons. Similarly, effects of Rune workings are quite independent of the personal belief structure of the practitioner. Knowing of the actual origins of the confusion about Runes will make it easier for the serious student to understand the meanings and intricacies- of the Runic symbolism. He will learn to appreciate the benefits of a true symbolism and will understand what may happen to a \"Rune\" experimenter who is unfamiliar with the symbolism of the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes and their initiatory meaning. The tremendous increase in interest about the Runes in recent times has already been mentioned. After years of ineffectual mind games, many of those who are interested in metaphysical matters seem to have experienced a need for practical experience and a desire to gain access to realms about which their teachers were merely talking. Many people now are feeling the urge to get in touch with realities beyond their everyday life rather than indulging in fruitless logistic metaphysical analysis or what is worse endlessly listening to others proffering creeds and dogmas. Many people are now ready to probe into those realms where thoughts are just beginning to take shape, and where a subtle cybernetics of formation on many levels is continuously shaping and reshaping the laws that 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Rune Magick Book - Introduction govern our universe. These are the realms that can be experienced with the help of the Runes. In every workshop that I conduct there is an apparent need to approach and experience un- speakable realms of continuous creation among the participants. Many have had dramatic and powerful first experiences of the workings of Rune Realms. To you who have become aware of the importance of the Runes, this book will give long needed information. It will teach you the meaning of the Runic symbolism, the meanings of the individual Runes, and an overview of many applications of the Runes. After you have read this book, and after you have had your first results with Rune Magic, you may well decide to study with a Rune Master in order to get the full benefit of this ancient system of initiation, and of harnessing psychic and spiritual powers. Karl Welz, 1984 A word about myself to the student of the courses I started my studies of Rune magic 1972 while in Berlin, Germany. I have written the Rune courses starting in 1982. These courses have striking differences to all other approaches to Rune magic that I have learned in the past. It is obvious that the Blavatskian-Theosophical pseudo-historical approach (to which most Rune Masters of the 20th century subscribed) is entirely bankrupt in many respects and totally untenable, if not ridiculous. History, biology, archaeology and other modern sciences tell an entirely different story than these ludicrous reveries of the first half of the 20th century about \"Atlantis\", \"root races\", \"Hyperboreans\" or the Hörbiger theories of a hollow world, which may have originated as an esoteric side-effect, perhaps \"philosophical justification\" of European colonialism, and to which only a few lunatics and a couple of \"secret lodges\" of our era, most of them with definite fascist undertones, are still subscribing. From the very beginning of my studies on, I have recognized the Runes as primary abstractions. In fact, their simplicity, and at the same time complex effects, pointed to the fact that these abstractions were of a pre-linguistic, in some situations even non-linguistic kind. This means that we can trace back this type of creative interaction with the environment to the earliest origins of humankind, even before language as we know it evolved. Approaching Runes this way, I could no longer treat Runes in the way that practically all authors of the past viewed them: namely as the Germanic substitute, alternative, or replacement, for the magical systems that are based on the Cabbala. This was the approach that has been reverberating throughout all Runic literature that I have studied, and it is so in most Runic literature still in our days. In fact, the simplicity of the Runic approach to magic and the fact that Runes were not as easily to control by some people as were the cabbalistic energies made me aware that there was a dimension to this ancient system that traditional magicians have overlooked - or of which they have not been aware at all, even if some of their practices sometimes included a few elements of this dimension, a dimension that reaches far beyond the language-based structures of the Cabbala. Having had this experience of Runes, I then decided to approach the Runes as creating and defining energies rather than created and well-defined ones. When I established this approach to Runes, which included the definition and use of the \"Rune Realms\" (see the Basic Rune Course, inner Rune Realm, outer Rune Realm and Rune Realm of creative energies) they naturally revealed their immense power to me and they did so instantly! In addition to that, they turned out to be relatively easy to control, since I approached them according to their nature: as energies belonging to the realms of creation, as defining energies rather than the 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Rune Magick Book - Introduction typical cabbalistic ones that are well defined. I did not tie the Runes onto the \"Procrustes bed\" of cabbalistic thinking nor did I force the Runes into the mold of \"definitions\". Consequently I had easy access to the enormous power of the creative realms. These realms are beyond the well-defined planetary energies (or entities of the spheres in a Bardonian sense) and, in fact, you can use these creative energies as modifiers of such entities. This became very clear when I evoked Bardonian spirits and other entities inside a Runic circle. The Runes allowed the creation of energy fields (entities) with a power and flexibility that simply cannot appear when we work with the same energies without the impact of a connection to the realms of creation. This entirely new, and yet ancient, approach to Runes is the crux of my courses and the magical practice therein that you are going to study and apply. Naturally, I used the 18 Runes that Guido von List introduced. In fact, it did not take much practice to recognize their superiority over all other systems, including those of which their authors and promoters claim to be \"elder\". It certainly is obvious that List was onto something when he had his \"revelations\", without ever fully realizing just how powerful this system can be. After experiencing the creation-dimension of the Runes (above all the 18 Futhork Runes, i.e., the Armanen System), there is no way that we can speak ever again of a Rune magic besides the known cabbalistic methods or as a substitute of these methods based on Germanic religion. Quite to the contrary, the Armanen Futhork is a system of creative energies that naturally reaches far beyond the well-defined cabbalistic energies. We can use these qualitatively superior, defining and creating Runic energy fields to achieve our ultimate magical flexibility as human beings, either in conjunction with well-defined energies (\"Bardonian entities, cabbalistic spirits\", etc.) or independently from them. The far-reaching potential of this new method and new approach became obvious when, at some point (still while writing the lessons of the Basic Rune course under the aspect of this new approach) I evoked a Germanic god with a Rune. Before the god could manifest, the Rune asked me what god I wanted to create! As a consequence of the life force technology that I developed (I have built the first device on this planet that actually generates life force, i.e., the Chi Generator®, or generator of Od) and the explanation of magic, radionics, and the power of abstractions such as thought forms, gods, sigils, radionic settings, etc. (see my course \"Magick of the Future\"), the power of a Rune magic that is rooted in the realms of creation has increased significantly! A Rune can then become a creative energy that is continuously powered by life force coming from a Chi Generator®. You can direct the general effect of its action and define the outcome of the operation. The Rune (or bind-rune) will then be the ultimate thought-form that works independently and creatively towards the result with an efficiency that the traditional \"spirits\", \"familiars\", etc., certainly can never exhibit. When studying the courses, especially the Basic Rune Course, be aware of the power of the realms of creation that you learn to access with your first lesson. With this awareness, you will gain a maximum benefit from your studies and you certainly will have the practical experience that helps you understand and use the tremendous power of the Armanen Runes. Karl Hans Welz, 2005 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"What are Runes? WHAT ARE RUNES? From one point of view, we can consider Runes as an ancient esoteric tradition of harnessing cosmic energies. From another they could appear as a system of switches, or triggers, which allow access to otherwise inaccessible transcendental energies. Every Rune combines a triple aspect: it is 1. A hieroglyph, a symbol, or letter; 2. A number (because of its position in the symbolism of the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes, and 3. An idea, in the Platonic sense Thus, to combine Runes means to combine ideas, and to act creatively upon the universe. Any one of these descriptions, and there are many others, show but one aspect of Runes. We cannot define exactly what Runes are, because definitions are verbal. Language describes things on the various material levels \"after they are created\" Definitions describe what we perceive in the world of forms. Runes belong to the levels of creation, which are deeper than the worlds of forms, and which are not accessible by the language of logics or by any verbal mappings. The only thing that language can do for people who want to explore the realms of Runes is to provide them with triggers that connect with Runes. Another way of exploring and using the realms of creation is with the help of a symbolism. Each of the symbols of Runes has a symbolic meaning and an evocative meaning. The symbolic meaning is found in the outline of the Runic symbols. This gives a basic idea of a specific part of the Realms of Creation. The evocative function of the Runic symbols can lead to direct experience of the specific Realm of the Rune. Added to the system of Runic symbols are various other \"triggers\" that give access to the energies of Creation. One such system is given in the Song of Odin, and by the Magical Poem, which in each of its 18 stanzas describes some of the effects that can be produced when the specific Rune is brought to act on the material planes, again in symbolic language. You can find a more intricate system of access to the various Runes in the 18 Rune Songs. These songs, one for each of the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes, were handed down mouth-to-ear from Rune master to student throughout the centuries. They contain a significant initiatory value. In other words, these songs help the student to develop his or her skills of Runic practice effectively and in a relatively short time. Needless to say, these powerful tools for harnessing cosmic energies are accessible only to persons who are committed to the path of becoming a Rune master. To avert possible misuse, the songs have never been published. We must always be aware that whatever we say Runes are, this describes but an aspect of Runes: generally Just one of the many effects that Runes can have on the material plane. No matter how many statements we make about Runes we can never encompass them completely. Even if we were satisfied with merely describing their effects, the task would be never ending, no matter how accurate or numerous our descriptions. Runes are not accessible to logistic mind games. The student and practitioner of Rune Magic finds this out very quickly. Similarly, Runes escape the many games of esoteric speculation, often under the guise of \"channeling\" which are popular nowadays. Runes cannot be explained satisfactorily within the framework of any of the existing esoteric or metaphysical systems. They come from deeper levels of human experience. However, although Runes cannot be defined by languages or metaphysical mappings, they can be experienced on levels that are not accessible to logical and verbal description. Once there is a link of experience connecting you to the Realms of Runes, you may experience thought forms that can be expressed in words. You will know that these words arc not the Runes, but they will help you to gain access to the Runes whenever you desire to do so. Words of this kind will be your tool to dynamize your specific wishes and intentions with Runic energies. You may experience Runes more directly on levels where thoughts begin to take shape. Runes belong to the eternal NOW of continuous creation. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"What are Runes? In the pages that follow, you will be given many methods of access to the Runic Realms, and to the individual realms of specific Runes. These methods include descriptions of Runic effects, systematic stanzas, Rune mantras, hand positions of Runes, special meditations, and so on. In every case you will need to be aware that. you are being given triggers of access to Runic energies. The Rune itself cannot be described, yet it can be experienced. Using the methods that follow, you can develop your understanding of Runes step by step at the same time as you develop your skill in harnessing Runic energies. You will gain access to the Realms of the Runes, and you will learn to interact with Runes on non-verbal levels, on pro-logical levels of creation. The meaning of the word \"Rune\" can give the student a valuable clue. \"Runa, in the old Germanic language means \"murmur.\" When Bishop Wulfila translated the Latin (Vulgate) version of the Bible into the Germanic vernacular he used the word \"runa\" to translate \"mystery\" in \"the mysteries of the Kingdom.\" Putting these ideas together we get the concept of a mysterious murmur; a murmur that does not have the form of logical words. Think of it as a hunch that cannot yet be expressed in words, yet carries sound: the sacred sound of creation. Runa, or murmur, invokes in us the idea of a creative act, expressed by an indefinable sound, set in action by a voice which comes from the depths of creation; which penetrates everything; invisible sound that links us to the ETERNAL NOW. 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Symbolism of the Runes THE SYMBOLISM OF THE RUNES There are some people who think that a symbol becomes an active symbol (one having an effect on the material levels), once it is charged with energy. Others believe that every symbol emanates some kind of radiation by itself, and that charging it is not necessary. The latter strengthen their position by pointing out results of the intensive research, which has been done on pyramids, pentagrams, hexagrams, talismans, and other symbolic structures. In those experiments, energies were found to emanate from uncharged symbols. The opponents of this view counter that expectation of the effects had in fact charged the symbols, although the action was done subconsciously. The two positions may be summarized by saving that one group emphasizes the position that the symbol contains the energy and the other insists that any symbol must be charged before it emanates any energy. A third position is taken by those who say that the energetic effect of the symbol is the result of centuries old beliefs projected on the symbols and producing a collective charge. And there is a set of practitioners who claim that it is the belief of the worker with the symbol that causes the charge. Needless to say, each of these groups produces evidence for their idea, and can prove its validity within their own world mapping and intellectual framework. The arguing among the groups is destined to be fruitless because any new facts are forced into the preconceived mold of the postures instead of being used to expand the theories. Since all the viewpoints seem to be correct in some way, we have to develop a new picture of how things interact that contains all of them, and which is flexible enough to contain any other opinions based on observation. It is clear from a reading of the literature that most of the people theorizing in metaphysics have not yet attained the scientific level of say, quantum mechanics, which is capable of incorporating varied and sometimes contradictory observations into one general theory or mapping. It is from this background that we assert the principle on which this Rune work is based. None of the theories mentioned hold any interest to us as practical Rune workers. What is important to us is how we can practically USE the Runic energies that we perceive. We eat the apple instead of wasting effort discussing the various names by which it is known. The logic of the people who argue is part of the verbal levels; the truth of the Runes is beyond those levels. What we actually observe is that when we work with Runes, then we can trigger specific energies, or vibrations. For convenience, we talk about \"shape\" vibrations, which are found in the Rune symbolism, whether those symbols be drawn, visualized, posed with body or hand, sung, or heard with the inner ear. It is irrelevant to us whether Runes and their energies and vibrations result from the use of Runes over long periods of time, or whether the natural laws of Rune energy are shape specific, universal (like gravity), or statistical. What is important is that we can work with Runes and that the energies of Runes have some relation to the material levels, which can be formulated by natural laws. These laws we can use to devise useful ways of applying Rune energies to have a desired impact on our universe. It does not matter to us whether a technology is \"true\" or \"false.\" Our only concern is that it is useful. Now that our position is clear, we can go more deeply into what we mean by symbols. Symbols have several aspects. They have an outline, or some kind of shape. This shape need not be limited to our visual sense. It can be auditive, like a mantra, kinetic, like a dance, or can be part of any of our access systems of perceptions. Furthermore, one of the aspects that a symbol contains, is its symbolic aspect. By this we mean that we can derive some meaning of the symbol by analyzing and getting in tune with its shape, The symbolic meaning which we find in such a symbol does not need to be active. It does not have to emanate any energy. Next, there is the evocative aspect of the symbol. This aspect is not necessarily represented in the outline or shape of the symbol. The evocative meaning needs no context. The symbol serves as a trigger, giving access to a particular evocative realm and meaning connected with the symbol. Many of the evocative meanings of symbols are man-made, Some symbols that have been misused are \"protected\" so that their specific energies are not easily available until the negative evocative characteristic has been eliminated from the symbol. The energetic aspects of a symbol then can be derived from the symbolic and evocative meanings of the symbol. A symbol can be part of a symbolism. As has already been mentioned, we mean by this term an 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Symbolism of the Runes ordered arrangement of symbols in which their positioning with respect to one another is important. The position of the symbol within the symbolism is according to its specific energy. It is also true that the symbolism is always greater than the sum of its parts. We have already mentioned too that many of the \"Rune\" alphabets quoted in current books are not symbolisms but incoherent arrays in which the sum of the parts is not greater than the whole. Practice with the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes will show you practically and by experience that the realm of a symbolism encompasses more than the sum of its component symbols. Other arbitrary arrays of symbols have hardly any dimension beyond the sum of the individual parts. In a symbolism that we call linear, such as an alphabet, each symbol has a number assigned. The number given to the symbol determines its position within the symbolism. It does not describe the symbol in a numerological way, nor does the number add its own meaning to the symbol. The Runic symbolism is more than linear, as you will find out in your studies. For now, let us just say that the symbolism of the Runes can be applied to the space around the Earth, and it is based on the hexagon with its three inscribed diameters. Symbolisms in general represent a form of mapping of the realms for which the symbols are relevant. The symbolism of chemistry for example is based on the periodic system of the elements. It is a valid mapping for the realm of chemistry. Using this system and formulas derived from if, a person can make accurate descriptions of the many phenomena for which the system is relevant. We do not know of any material thing, which we could not express with the help of chemical formulas. This does not mean, however, that the system constitutes a world formula, or an exhaustive mapping of everything that happens in the universe. (In fact, being an abstraction, it cannot be. Looking for an abstraction that \"explains everything\" is like hunting the snark! By its nature, an abstraction leaves things out. ) There are other mappings that deal with matters for which the chemistry mapping may be unsuitable; physics for instance, or Boolean algebra. However, WE KNOW OF NO SYMBOLISM THAT CAN GIVE AN EXHAUSTIVE DESCRIPTION OF EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS. Furthermore, EVERY SYMBOLISM IMPLIES A FRAMEWORK IN WHICH IT IS VALID. Our common experience makes these statements seem obvious, even unnecessary. However, many occultists, astrologers included, act as if they are not aware of these simple principles. They deduce \"truth\" logically from their system as if their system described everything. It takes a scientific training to make one capable of handling symbolisms correctly, and with the limitations of the symbolism always present in the mind. Unfortunately, there are very few in the metaphysical field with such training. The uses of the symbolism of chemistry are limited to the descriptions of the interactions of matter, as defined by chemistry, and can be used to develop practical applications of the science. The chemistry symbol system cannot be applied to everything in the universe. Similarly, there is no metaphysical or hyperphysical symbolism which can be applied exhaustively to ALL things. Runes are no exception. It is possible to describe many phenomena in Runic terms especially phenomena that occur on levels above the Material planes. As you study the Runes, you will gain knowledge that is useful for you when you develop specific strategies to be applied on the material levels and on levels above the material. Bear in mind while doing this that the world formula syndrome permeates most metaphysical circles because so many of the workers in those fields lack the scientific training that makes fully aware symbol manipulation possible. Be very attentive to the assumptions behind the writings of such metaphysicians, even when they write about Runes. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Properties of Esoteric Symbolisms PROPERTIES OF ESOTERIC SYMBOLISMS Symbolisms that describe phenomena on the material plane can generally be expressed by mathematical formulas that are derived from logical mappings reflecting the important characteristics of the field being examined. Metaphysical or hyperphysical symbolisms are not as simple as those used for the purely material levels of existence. They have to take into account phenomena that occur on levels beyond the material. The experience of centuries has suggested many metaphysical mappings. The one we shall use is that beyond the material levels are the astral planes, the mental planes, and the world of emanation. . Symbolisms that encompass these levels must of necessity be more complex than material level symbolisms. Purely mental descriptions no longer suffice for the new levels. They require \"thinking\" or \"intuition\" beyond the sleep-like thinking of the average person or materialistic scientist. However, the person who is on the threshold of penetrating those higher planes has nothing to fear, because a characteristic of esoteric symbolisms is that they LEAD the student into the kind of thinking that is necessary to master those symbolisms. Another way of saying this is that they have an INITIATORIC FUNCTION. Runes are no exception. In fact they seem to have especially strong powers of introducing the student to themselves. As the student progresses with the practices, the quality of his or her thinking, intuition, inspiration, and what comes beyond, continually improves and deepens. In this characteristic lies the main difference between these and the materialistic symbolisms. It is up to the student to find out that this is so by PRACTICE of the esoteric symbolism. Knowing \"about\" it is not enough. Such material planes logic will never get you free from the bondage of the material levels. What counts for us is not whether a method or practice is \"true\" or \"false\" according to the logic of the material planes, but whether it is useful from the viewpoint of those higher planes that can only be reached by PRACTICE. To summarize it all: The function of initiation is a characteristic inherent in esoteric symbolisms. Practice of these symbolisms leads to the development of the mental, psychic, and spiritual capabilities necessary for the most effective use of those symbolisms. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Path of Initiation THE PATH OF INITIATION That the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes constitute an esoteric symbolism and as such a path of initiation, is beautifully shown in Odin's Rune Song and the following Magical Poem. Odin's Rune Song shows you how to get Rune experience, and the Magical Poem provides you with a system of 18 triggers: one song or stanza for each Rune. Experiencing the depth of Odin's Rune Song will give you a valuable key to access the Rune Realms. After you have experienced the Rune Song and the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes you will have no doubt about whether you should continue to work with the symbolism or with an incoherent array of \"Runes\" which cannot have the integrative power of a symbolism. Certainly, the lore of the ancient gods will interest you less than the godlike power available to you personally in the symbolism. The symbolism of the Runes is multi-ordinal and stratified Knowledge. First, you get acquainted with each individual Rune and you will experience the realm of each Rune. With your first initiation, everything will fall into place and the symbolism of the Rune system will communicate itself to you. From then on, the practice that you perform with the Runes will be backed up by your connection with the realm of the symbolism. After the first initiation, you will again go the path through each individual Rune, now with the advantage of your contact with the realm of the symbolism, to a higher initiation. Initiations are best experienced as part of a specific Rune ceremonial, within a group situation and best of all, in unspoiled natural surroundings. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The 18 Sacred Futhork Runes as a True Esoteric Symbolism THE 18 SACRED FUTHORK RUNES AS A TRUE ESOTERIC SYMBOLISM The Song of 0din, the Magical Poem, the graphical structure of the Runes, and of course individual experience of Rune masters, prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes are a true esoteric symbolism. They have a common base from which the symbols are derived: the hexagon with its three inscribed diameters. They are ordered by position as a linear symbolism or as an alphabet. They are ordered in a plane as a two dimensional symbolism. In fact there are many possible arrangements of the symbols in a two dimensional mode, each one pointing to another facet of the symbolism. They reach into dimensions beyond the material planes. Practice with them enhances thinking, psychic, and intuitive capabilities. As individual symbols, they have a number and symbolic and evocative sets of dimensions. The symbolism as a whole is greater than the mere sum of its constituent symbols. The symbolism of the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes constitutes a set of mappings of specific characteristics not only in the material planes, but in the planes beyond, including the roots of those planes, the realms of creation. Practice of the symbolism will open up to you the specific natural laws of those realms of finer densities. As a result, your scientific thinking will be developed even so as to be capable of working with the realms of creation, and putting them to use. The only limit is the vision of the magician. The magician who makes the better mathematical mappings is the better magician. 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Odin's Rune Song and the Magickal Poem The Rune Song of Odin and the Magical Poem that follows contain a lifetime's work in evocation and contemplation.

To help you develop the mental equipment to do this exploration is a major aim of this book. Odin's Rune Song I know myself hanging on the wind cold tree for nine icy nights. Wounded by the spear, consecrated to Wodan I consecrated to myself. I was hanging on the mighty tree which conceals man Where man grew out of its roots. They offered me neither bread nor wine So I bent down in search. I recognized the Runes; wailing I grasped them. Until I sank down from the tree. Now I began to increase, to be wise, To grow and to feel well. From the word, word grew after word And deed shaped to deeds with deeds. Now I know the songs like no wise one knows And none of the children of men.

The one only knows who is in my arms as my only lover. To achieve a maximum understanding of these Rune songs you need to open up to their symbolic contents and their evocative Meanings; which do happen with practice of the Runes, Needless to say, the more you practice, the more of the deep symbolisms will be revealed to you. Odin's Rune Song, and the eighteen stanzas of the Magical Poem, show quite clearly that initiatory content of this mysterious, ancient, tradition. Personal experience will give you all the direct evidence you need about the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes. Since the outlines of the Runes are derived from the hexagon with its three inscribed diameters, thus forming 6 equilateral triangles, the connection with eighteen, the number of the Runes, is obvious. Singing Runes compares with singing mantras of power. Once you sing a Rune consciously, than you turn on a switch that gives you access to transcendental energies, whether you want this to happen or not. Slowly the Runes will communicate to you how to manage and use these energies, provided that you are spiritually ready to accept the Runes, and ready to overcome the bondages of the world tree and of your self-imposed limitations. Here we said that the Runes would act as triggers and communicate with you. Each of these mappings reflect but one aspect of Runes. Of course, no matter what description of the Runes we produce, such a description is not all of what Runes are. Runes are beyond all mappings. Whether you see Runes as energies, as triggers to energies, as spiritual entities, as gods, as mantras or all of these is irrelevant. Runes will remain beyond any description. Rune experience includes realms beyond description, beyond words, on the un-speakable levels of experience. Every Rune connects with worlds of creation and formation. Therefore, when you connect with Runes, you can expect material effects that correspond to the specific Rune that you work with. Be aware too, that the most powerful methods are often the simplest ones. They are often of a simplicity that is beyond the understanding of many people. Such people practice for years to master what they could have mastered right away. The deepest mysteries are often the simplest to penetrate: but they self- protect against misuse and profanation. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Access Keywords of Runes and correlations ACCESS KEY WORDS AND CORRELATIONS OF RUNES This section is a treasure chest of material for Rune contemplation.

It is the Rune of karmic debts (the Norn SKULD), of karmic law, of karmic need. NOD signifies Divine justice that balances. \"Hate\" in the song refers to unresolved karma. Nod helps to master your karma after you have accepted it and recognized it as a structuring process rather than the primitive assumption of cause-effect.

Uses: NOD makes you aware of your karmic debts and it helps dissolve karma. It leads to truth and fitting into the cosmic order, or the Divine Plan. NOD brings the protection of high spiritual entities of our Solar System. Use your karma and live it consciously. The emphasis here is on \"use\". With NOD you can recognize that karma is a structuring process rather than strict cause-effect and that the postulate (\"law\") of cause-effect is nothing but a human fallacy!

These procedures are not intended as a substitute for competent medical advice. All matters relating to personal health require qualified medical supervision, of course. The following chapter was included for reasons of offering a complete picture of the scope of Rune practice in the past. HEALING WITH RUNES One of the great advantages of symbolisms over incoherent arrays is that symbolisms can be applied to specific parts of the universe. Here we are interested in correlating Runes with various body parts and functions. Since such a correlation is easy to demonstrate, the Rune system lends itself to the healing of the body and the balancing of its energies. Only intense practice with Runes can bring about a clear understanding of the mechanics of healing with Rune energies. However, what we describe in the following will give some ideas of what healing with Runes is about. Some experience with Rune exercises will be helpful. Runes constitute a symbolic description of energies of the levels of creation. The symbolism furnishes you with a spectrum of energies coming from the levels of creation. There are some analogies with the spectrum of natural colors, but runes and colors are different things. When you practice Rune Magic or Rune Healing, then you work with energies from the levels of creation. Runes allow you to act creatively upon your universe. To know the characteristics of the Rune \"spectrum\" is a condition for your participating in creation. When healing with Runes, you project energy upon the person to be healed. To this energy you attach the specific Rune vibration from the levels of creation. Unlike projection of Light or of White Light, Runes allow the use of the specific \"colors\" of their spectrum. In any particular case, there may be a certain color that has beneficial effects and another color that blocks those beneficial effects. The person who projects Light alone without consideration of the spectrum would be like one who prescribes every drug on the market assuming that one of them will do the trick. There may well a few of those drugs that counteract the beneficial effects of certain others. Projection of Runes for healing purposes may yield spectacular results. Yet we caution not to abandon fully any other treatment in favor of Rune Healing, or any other psychic or spiritual healing, See the note on a previous page concerning this matter. Only a Rune master skilled in hermetic knowledge is capable of selecting specific Runes for given conditions. To such a Rune master, Runes are also helpful in finding the actual root causes of a specific complaint, or undesirable body condition, such as too much body fat. The fact that Runes are not limited by our self-imposed limitations of space-time allows the skilled Rune Magician to establish beneficial mechanisms of healing that come from beyond our space-time continuum, and that can extend their influence into the future. Thus Runes can be one of the best means for the prevention of ailments as well as for the improvement of the overall condition for extensive periods of time. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Healing with Runes Projection of Rune energies can be produced in many ways. One of the most used methods is with the hands. Others involve charging the food, water, or even the air of the person being treated. Special diets, combined with Rune projection, will greatly enhance the effectiveness of the treatment, Another important addition to the treatment is practice of Rune Yoga. This is a discipline, which helps attract beneficial Rune energies by establishing specific shape vibrations that are in tune with vibrations of the energies that come from the Realms of Creation. An important adjunct to Rune methods of healing is the observation of specific cycles and Rune trends. For millennia, astrologers have searched for an esoteric astrology, but they have based their research on the materialistic symbolism of astrology. From this they indeed gained deep insights but not much else. The traditional astrologer tries to \"rule the stars\" or his destine, by wisely adjusting to the existing trends. The person who uses the Rune symbolism for his astrology finds the appropriate tools to MAKE TRENDS. This has a much more profound impact upon destiny, and is for our purposes a much more thorough approach for overcoming ailments, and for improving the overall condition of the body, soul, and mind. There are also valuable spiritual benefits in this kind of approach, TRADITIONAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN RUNES AND HERMETIC MEDICINE FA - ailments of the head. Feverish diseases. Burns off fat.

The preceding correlations may be understood in many ways, depending on the level at which the Rune Magician is operating. Apart from the healing effects, Runes, and especially the shape vibrations of Rune Yoga, have strong effects on the spiritual centers (chakras) in the body. Projection of specific Runes upon these centers will awaken them and purify them. The knowledge of which Runes work with what chakras is not public knowledge, for the danger of misuse is too great. Students of a Rune master usually meet with these matters in dealing with the Rune IS. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Invocation and Evocation INVOCATIVE AND EVOCATIVE PROCESSES After this brief excursion into physiology, we deal with something different. If you could not follow all of the preceding material, don't worry! Things will just fall effortlessly into place during your natural progress as you practice Rune Magic. As with certain branches of mathematics, doing it makes it clearer than studying it. Runes, as we have said before, act from the objective but un-speakable levels of continuous creation. The effect of Runes can be felt within ourselves, and can be projected outside ourselves. In other words, Runes have invocative as well as evocative characteristics, The process of invocation is known to most people with some background in metaphysics. When you invoke, you open yourself to a specific energy or entity, parts of which you draw inside yourself by establishing a place of manifestation within yourself. How much you draw inside yourself is determined by how much space you make. If the process of invocation goes out of control, then states of possession can ensue. This happens all too often when the person practicing invocations does not prepare and protect properly. Channeling without protection can be dangerous and all too often attracts the wrong entity. This state of affairs is not helped by the naive way in which so many metaphysically inclined people believe anything told them which is the result of channeling. A stupid being does not become wise merely by dying, nor does a malicious being become benevolent. Logical thinking is needed more in metaphysical matters than in everyday affairs. Runes are such that their impact via invocation can easily be modified and limited to what is desirable. Contrary to popular belief, the process of evocation is harmless. The evocative energies becoming invocative can be the threat to the practitioner who did not know how to protect himself. In evocation, the energies or entities evoked manifest outside the practitioner. This situation permits the triggering of immensely powerful energies. If these energies become invocative, i.e. if they invade the \"circle of protection\" then the practitioner may become overcharged. This is a potentially dangerous situation, and can lead to states of possession, because energies of a high order have a dimension of personification. In extreme circumstances the physical death of the unprotected practitioner could occur. To avoid such problems with evocations, the practitioner has to have knowledge of a specific determinism and of the structure of the magical universe. To access the evocative meanings of Runes or of any symbolism, you need to become familiar with the processes of evocation and invocation. Our severe caution about the dangers of these processes is to be understood in the same spirit as cautions against the dangers of driving a powerful car. Nobody considers giving up driving and its benefits because of the very real dangers involved. Instead, they learn how to drive, and when driving they drive with care. The energy or entity, which has been drawn by an evocative process, can increase its power almost indefinitely, since the problem of overcharging the body of the practitioner does not arise. The only limit of the magician in this case is the limit of his or her power of imagination and visualization. Whoever is the better mathematician will be the stronger magician. By mathematics, we mean a higher kind of mathematics than the academic one: a mathematics that encompasses the higher levels of existence. The recognition of significant patterns is still a basic feature, as it is in ordinary mathematics. In any use of Runes, the two principles of evocation and invocation are involved. There is no act, which does not involve both principles, to some extent. The situation is analogous to the commercial act of buying and selling. They always go together, although it is possible to study each function 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Invocation and Evocation separately. The strength of the Rune magician is the ability to intensify the evocative dimension of Rune experience as well as the capabilities of the body at all levels, physical, astral, and so forth. This increases automatically the intensity of the invocation involved and the result is a speeding up of the evolutionary process, which enables the magician to draw nearer to the goal of passing through tens of thousands of years of evolution in a few lifetimes. When you begin to practice Runes, you will do so in the invocative mode. You tap into the Rune realms and you draw Rune energies into yourself, into your inner Rune Realm. As soon as you establish your outer Rune Realm then you bring in the evocative dimension, However even though you will learn how to project Runes for healing and to draw specific circumstances, the beginning practice will be in the main invocative. Once you have experienced Runes as a symbolism, then you are ready for the more evocative dimensions of Runes. In fact most of your work after that point will emphasize the evocative dimensions. You draw Runes from the realms of creation. Then you project them through your outer Rune Realm into your universe. The stronger the evocative dimension, the greater the success of your Magical operation will be. Rune Magic is hyper physics in its strongest form. It is a method that operates from planes invisible to the physical eye: and it acts upon the material, tangible universe. Therefore, Runes allow you to do things that you cannot do with \"mind power,\" \"mind control,\" and similar techniques. With Runes, you can have impact upon your surroundings, and you can cause changes in your inner world. Since these actions are generated in the deep levels of creation, at those levels where thoughts begin to take shape, Runes can act faster and more strongly than any other method known in metaphysics. Rune Magic is operated from a hyperspace beyond ordinary space-time. It is beyond the created forms and beyond the well defined energies of the cosmos. Consequently, the applications of Rune Magic are unlimited. No matter how far advanced you are in Rune Magic, no matter how many uses for it you know, there will always be new applications and discoveries for you to make. At the same time, you will experience continuous progress in your understanding of the workings of the universe. The power of imagination is the limit of the power of the magician. With Rune practice, the power of the imagination automatically increases. After even a brief period of practice with Runes you will experience: General self-improvement Awareness of your Magical Powers Increase in your Magical Powers Healing capabilities Deep insights into the workings of the universe Spiritual insights and experiences Psychic capabilities Awakening of Chakras Emotional Equilibrium Harmony within your environment Being in control ... And much more 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Rune Realms THE RUNE REALMS Before you begin to practice Runes, you need to establish within yourself a space within which you can work. It will also be useful to have some symbolic arrangement outside which you can use to draw and to project Rune energies. Remember that we are not concerned with whether what we describe is \"true\" or \"false,\" but whether and how effectively it can be put to use, and if we can achieve with this method the results that we expect. The arrangement outside, we call the outer Rune Realm, The workspace that we establish inside is the inner Rune Realm. It is from this latter space that we draw the Rune energies known as the realm of creation. Using the power of imagination, we can connect those three realms. At some later time, when your work with Runes has brought about greater visualizing powers, you will be able to see the Rune Realms connected by the axis of the multidimensional world tree, in such a way that the Rune Realms are equidistant from each other. You will also become aware that the inner Rune Realm is no more completely within yourself than the outer Rune Realm is completely outside. The three Realms permeate and interpenetrate one another. With practice, the mutual contact of the three Rune Realms is continually enhanced, as are your powers of harnessing the energies of the Runes. The Outer Rune Realm You can best create your outer Rune Realm by using utensils. As a magician, you need to be aware that repeated use of the same utensil allows you to set up magical structures without using your own energies. In this way you free your conscious mind for whatever is most important in your action. Magical utensils are analogous to machines on the material planes. They can be regarded as machines that have effects reaching into planes beyond the material levels. Such utensils are focal points. The best utensil is of a symbolic arrangement so that it can be the focal point for any desired energy of a specific symbolism. A very strong set of utensils symbolizes the ancient four elements, which can appear in three ways at least. They may symbolize the four elements on the material planes, the four elements on all other planes, and also the four planes on which the magician acts. We suggest therefore that you use a set of utensils that symbolize the elements. Use candles for fire, the will of the magician or the world of emanation. Use a cup with water or wine for the water element, the emotions of the magician, or the astral world. Use a dagger for the air element (active form), or incense for the passive form, the mind of the magician and the mental spheres. Use a dish of earth, a coin, or some talisman to represent the element earth, matter, the consciousness of the magician, and the material planes upon which you wish to act. Be aware of the old wisdom that when you align all four elements, you can do anything you want to do. If is symbolic of having will, mind, emotions, and consciousness all directed at the same goal. This can be achieved with the proper direction of will power, control of thoughts focus of emotions and conscious attitude. (see the course in cosmic consciousness!) The Rune magician is not at all like the ordinary person who thinks one thing, feels another, says something different from either and does something else altogether. The next very important symbolism is that of protection. This is often symbolized as a circle. However, for it to be very effective, it is better to imagine a sphere, or a bubble. All three physical dimensions need protection. Inside that sphere or bubble, you are the creating Divinity of that universe. Finally, we reach the symbolism which gives you access to the energies with which you want to practice the Rune symbolism. 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Rune Realms You arrange the Runes in a circle, beginning with FA in the North, going counterclockwise until you have YR next to FA. Then you put EH on your left and GIBOR on your right in the center, as you face FA. So EH will be at 9 o'clock, and GIBOR at 3 o'clock. If you have planned a specific Rune practice, you had best have the Rune or Runes concerned in front of you, and out of the context of the circle. This symbolically brings you in touch with the specific Rune or Runes. You may also use a set of rituals to establish your outer Rune Realm. A ritual is part of a ceremonial. You will learn specific rituals in your practice towards mastery of the Runes. Here we just mention that there are a set of rituals, which include lighting of candles, charging of the elements, lighting of the incense, establishing of the protection, and so forth, including the purification of the practicing Rune magician. The Inner Rune Realm Once the outer Rune Realm is established, you continue to establish the inner Rune Realm. You may of course, establish the inner Rune Realm by itself and project the Runes mentally. However, unless you are well advanced the effect will be mainly in the mental spheres. For training in establishing the inner Rune Realms, you need not establish the outer Realm first. This is also true for Rune meditations. However, it is always useful to have at least one candle burning as a focal point. For any work, where you expect effects on the astral, emotional, conscious or material planes, you are advised to set up the outer Rune Realm first. Quite often, students complain that their results were less than spectacular. In a minority of cases, failures of this kind may be due to Karmic reasons. Usually it is due to failure to establish the outer Rune Realm before starting work on the inner Realm. The inner Rune Realm takes shape from your visualization. You build up a space within yourself, which is your working space. This is where you imagine yourself working with Runes, and knowing of the connection with the Realms of creation. You need to practice a bit and train yourself to the point where you can establish this Rune Realm spontaneously at any time. To establish your inner Rune Realm, proceed as follows: 1. Get comfortable. If you are going to do more than just practice, establish some symbolism of your outer Rune Realm. 2. Relax your body consciously. You may use any of the standard techniques involving the moving of consciousness from toes to head. 3. Imagine yourself being in a place, which you feel is appropriate for your inner Rune Realm. You may, for example, imagine that it is a sunny day and you are in a clearing in peaceful woods, close to a running brook. Alternatively, you may prefer the top of a mountain, or an old temple. Take a little time to choose a place that really suits you that you can imagine as being a holy place from which you will harness and trigger the Rune energies. This place will become a place of power. You are the ruler in this place, god of your universe. Students of the Order can have the assistance of a tape to help them in setting up their special place. You see yourself in the middle of this space, your Rune Realm, and you see yourself fully protected. This protection reaches out into your outer Rune Realm and connects with any protective measures you may have established there. Now see a circle of Runes around you. These Runes can be giant Rune stones, or wooden staves arranged around you, similar to the arrangement that you would have in your outer Rune Realm. The positions of FA to YR are as before, and EH and 61BOR are in the center, to the left and right respectively. Now see every one of the Runes around you in a glowing light, indicating that they get their charge from the Rune Realm of creation. Your outer Rune Realm will automatically be charged by this procedure, and a connection will be made with the Rune Realms of creation. At first you may not be totally aware of all this, but it happens. As you will further advance in the work, you will perceive the connection clearly. In any case, as the Rune magician of this universe, be aware that you are its 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Rune Realms absolute ruler. Having established your inner Rune Realm, you may operate from there on a purely mental level, or, if your outer Rune Realm is also established, then you may Keep the awareness of your inner Rune Realm being present, and you can begin with Rune rituals or ceremonials. Practice in your inner Rune Realm is necessary for good progress in Rune Magic and for your advancement as a Rune magician. 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Preliminary Practice PRELIMINARY PRACTICE Before you begin with the Rune practice, you should have prepared yourself accordingly. 1. Establish your Outer Rune Realm. 2. Establish your Inner Rune Realm. 3. Have your body relaxed to facilitate proper breathing. One of the best ways of doing this is by using the \"shavasana\" of Hatha Yoga. Lie flat on a mat with the arms at a slight angle to the sides. This is also the position of the SIE Rune, a variation of the Rune IS. Relax your muscles progressively. Be sure that jaws and tongue are relaxed, as well as the small muscles around the eyes. Eyes closed, at least at the beginning of your practice. A person who practices Hatha Yoga, usually ends a set of asanas or positions, with shavasana. Similarly, it is good for the Rune Magician to remain in this position for a while after Rune practice, after the grounding of the surplus Rune energies. SIE naturally follows on IS. This very simple, yet important Rune position causes peace, quietness, and the dissolving of tensions in the body. It is a help in resolving internal conflicts, in activating energies received, and in spiritual insight and illumination. 4. Conscious full breathing is very important. Without proper control of the breath, there can be no full success in Rune Magic. What most people consider as breathing is a poor fragment of the breathing that should be practiced. Full breathing is composed of: a) Breathing with the diaphragm, visible in the movement of the abdomen. b) The middle breath, during which the rib cage is expanding, and c) The upper breath wherein the shoulders are slightly lifted to ensure that the last remaining space available in the lungs is filled. Full breathing combines these three actions. On the in-breath, the body appears to expand in a wavelike motion from below the navel to the shoulders. When exhaling this motion goes the other way. Full breathing of this sort is the basis of all existing systems of healthful breathing. If you have a small child or baby that you can observe, just watch how the abdomen moves with every breath. Adult tensions and bad body habits tend to make for shallow breathing. The baby breathes naturally. You should practice this natural way of breathing in the position of SIE. Begin with the complete exhalation, and wait until the urge to inhale comes naturally. Then follow some definite rhythm of breathing. Some are listed below. Be sure to breathe gently and do not strain. Gentle stimuli strengthen the life force, stronger stimuli block it, and very strong stimuli can destroy it. The more gentle you are in this training, the faster the results. Some Rhythms to practice a) Inhalation: 5 seconds Hold breath: I second Exhalation; 5 seconds Mail for urge to inhale b) Inhalation: 4 seconds Hold: 2 seconds Exhalation: 4 seconds Pause: 2 seconds c) Inhalation 5 seconds Hold: 3 seconds Exhalation: 7 seconds Pause: 3 seconds d) Inhalation: 3 seconds Hold: 7 seconds Exhalation: 4 seconds Wait for urge to inhale e) Inhalation: 4 seconds 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Preliminary Practice Hold: 16 seconds Exhalation: B seconds Mail for urge to inhale Depending on your goal and capability you may extend these times, using the proper proportions for the set you choose. You may dynamize your in-breath by imagining that you are inhaling Odic energies, or specific Rune energies. 5. The next preparation is to transform your body into a large vibratory field of Rune sounds. Use only a good 'speak up front' voice, to achieve good resonance. Your voice should not seem to come from the throat, palate, or nose, or be squeezed out. Vowels should be formed up front. Practice M, N, and NG, alone and with vowels. This will increase your feeling for the sounds, and your capacity to make various parts of your body resonate with the sound, an essential part of Rune practice. 6. Thoughts are to be controlled. Allow only thoughts to do with the practice. Do not allow your mind to be a playground for vagrant thoughts. 7. The body needs to become accustomed to remaining in any Rune position for extended periods of time. When you are familiar with the practices 1 through 7, then you are ready for more involved practice. If you are already a Home Study Student, then you are not likely to have much trouble. The natural question that arises after mastering the initial practices to some extent is. In what sequence should I practice the Runes? This question is to be answered individually. Your Rune energy cycles are an important factor to be considered, as well as your personal Runes. If during your previous practices you found one specific Rune to which you feel strong links, then you may begin every practice with this Rune. You may also practice in the FUTHORK sequence. When you become advanced enough to tune in to what the Runes are telling you then you will intuitively know which is the best sequence for you at any given time» and for what purpose any sequence is best used. The hints that follow are mainly addressed to the Home Study Student though they can be read with profit by any interested person. Additional Hints Here are some useful hints for practice of the more powerful Rune exercises and ceremonials. Before you begin, clean your body, and wash off symbolically speaking, all impurities. Purify your Aura, using the instructions in the HAGAL lesson, and rub your body with good oil. The oil may contain herbs that are in accordance with the goals of your intent. Tune consciously into the vibrations of your own Rune Realms, and connect the three Rune Realms before starting. At this point you may withdraw from the circle those Runes that are the most in touch with you. At the end of your ceremonial, you may envision an auric enclosure of Odic energies around yourself, or position the Rune MAN, and sing its mantra to bring you in tune with the Holy Grail symbolism. Never forget to ground surplus energy at the end of every ceremonials rituals or other Rune practice. When grounding, visualize IS, and form IS in grounding position, visualizing all surplus energies flowing into the ground. You may also sing the Rune, beginning at the highest pitch you can reach, and gradually lowering it as you picture the energies flowing into the ground. This practice prevents you from being overcharged after the ceremonial. When practicing with a group, the group as a whole must perform the grounding. 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Rune Mantras SOUNDS OF RUNES, OR RUNE MANTRAS Up to this point, you have learned to use the sounds of the Rune names in your Rune practice. If you are a student of the 0rder, then you may have the tape on Rune mantras. If you do not have it, then you are limited to using the names as mantras. However, there is much more to the singing of Runes than the singing of their names. If you compare the Runes to colors of the spectrum, then the various intonations of the Runes would give you the many shades and hues of a sub spectrum for every Rune. Experience will tell you how to use these slightly different shades of Rune energies, and which sound connects with which specific bundle of energies of the Rune Realms of Creation. Even that gentle hint should make it clear that what lies before you is an extensive amount of Rune practice, and only consistent and preferably daily practice will lead to a mastery of the many shades and sub-shades of the Rune spectrum. At the beginning, exercise the Runes, one at a time, with a specific sounding of the name. It is useful, you will find, to recite the Song of the Rune before practicing ifs mantras. Next you introduce variations: a) Change pitch and loudness of sound. Hold the same pitch, increase power of voice, and then decrease again. Then change pitch from low to high, and back to low. Practice with high pitch alone, and then with low. Get the feel of the differences. Find as many combinations as possible. b) Practice with the hand positions changing them from close together fingered positions to the extended finger positions. c) Do it again with the palms down positions and the palms up positions. d) Hear the sound of the Rune with your inner ear and visualize the symbol with your inner eye while inhaling. This will be easy after you have practiced establishing your inner Rune Realm. Now it is different because you practice hearing the different pitches. By this means, you introduce the many hues of Rune sub-spectrums into your inner Rune Realm. This practice of visualizing while inhaling has especially strong effects on your chakras, if you project the appropriate Rune energies into those spiritual centers during the practice. e) Change and vary the sounds of the Runes by substituting vowels, or diphthongs. f) Next, focus on specific key-symbols of Runes, such as \"root, healing\" with UR, \"projection, activity with THORN, etc. g) Then include the body positions, changing from Rune to Rune, adjusting to the pitch, from which eventually a Rune dance develops. This will make you capable of drawing and modifying Rune energies more powerfully, and with more versatility than you can dream of as a beginner. Eventually, when you are a Rune master, you will develop your own background music for your practices. About pronunciation Vowels in Rune Mantras are the pure vowels: a is pronounced as in f-a-ther e is pronounced as in wh-e-y i is pronounced as in ant-i-que o is pronounced as in b-o-at u is pronounced as in g-oo-se You find the mantras in the section of the access keywords. 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Rune Staves RUNE READINGS Introduction Rune Readings are probably the best-known practical application of Rune Magic, as far as the general public is concerned. The metaphysical books concerning Runes are often devoted, almost entirely to Rune Readings. In fact some recent books are concerned with no other aspect of Runes at all. The type of readings dealt with in these books is usually very materialistic, or what could best be described as worldly. When this kind of reading is the goal, it is of little importance that the Runes used constitute a symbolism, rather than an array. Indeed, almost any set of symbols that describe life situations would suffice. Since this is so, a word of advice is called for. The 18 Sacred Futhork Runes are operating on the levels of the Realms of Creation. The SYMBOLISM of the Sacred Futhork does not lend itself easily to merely worldly readings. When you eventually perform Rune Readings with the help of the Sacred Futhork you should not forget that what seem to be statements about worldly situations are coming in fact from deeper, and more spiritual realms, the realms of Creation Eternal. To do a reading with the Sacred Futhork Runes, you need to fulfill several pro-conditions. Firstly, you must be TOTALLY familiar with the esoteric and exoteric meanings of the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes. Secondly, you need to establish your Rune Realms and be certain that you are tuned in to the Realms of Creation. It is NOT enough simply to cast the Runes for a reading and then look up the meaning of each Rune in a book. I am appalled when I think of the many publications in which a misuse of the Runes for merely worldly readings is taught. Certainly the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes are not suitable for such \"fortune telling\" activities. Serious worldly readings are much better performed with a traditional deck of Tarot cards. Rune Readings, when properly performed, are a voice from the Realms of Creation. Hence the need to be familiar with many aspects of Rune Magic, before you are ready to perform a Rune Reading. You must be capable at least of properly establishing your Rune Realms and also have had some ceremonial experience. Rune Readings are not something that you try as a first time activity. Rune Readings tell you of the energies from the Realms of Creation that are at the root of trends, or events, in the past, present, and future. Rune Readings then tell you what energies you may use in order to deal with the situation effectively and from what realms they should be called. Such a Rune Reading emphasizes the spiritual background of everything. The worldly outcome is merely a side effect of a deeper spiritual development. It is never the real crux of the matter. PREPARING RUNE STAVES Do you know how to cut? Do you know how to read? Do you know how to find? 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Rune Staves Do you know how to explore? Do you know how to demand? Do you know how to celebrate? Do you know how to project? Do you know how to redeem? (from Havamal v.l43) This set of Rune Staves is a kit of staves with the Runes engraved by hand. What it needs now is some of your own projection and some of your own charging, in order to make these staves powerful, personal tools to trigger Rune energies. By taking great care to do the finishing work on these staves you will be able to get in tune with each Rune, stave by staves and end up with a fully charged set. So you now have the staves cut into the wood to start you off, and it is up to you to sand them and polish them and charge them with your own energies. Before you begin on any Runes, read up on the meanings of it. When you are sanding and polishing, be aware of the meaning of the Rune that you are working withy and be aware too that there is much more meaning and significance yet to come, which will open up to you as you progress with your practices and study. Ideally, you should do this work in a ceremonial setting. Set your altar, and light your candle. You may use the ceremonial outlined in the \"Candle Magic with Runes\" pamphlet. If this isn't possible, get as close as you can to it. With each Rune, you proceed as follows: Position, or hand position for IS Say: Self conscious I am an antenna For rays and vibrations From the Realms of Creation. Position, or hand position of UR Say: Self conscious I draw the power From the deepest depths From the spheres of the Earth From the womb of All-Mother Position, or hand position of MAN Say: Self conscious I draw the power From the highest heights, From cosmic realms, From the great universe Position, or hand position of the Rune you are working with Say: Powers of ..... (Rune name) Come to me Stay with me Give me the wisdom and power Of your realm. NOTE: If body or hand positions are not yet known, strongly visualize the Rune with which you are working, in your inner eye. Now you can sand and polish. While doing this, project energy into the Rune. The Runes MAN and YR. KA and AR, FA and OS need to be notched at the bottom of the Rune or otherwise 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Rune Staves marked, so that you know later which Rune it is. The first step is to sand with fairly coarse sandpaper, rounding off corners and tiding up. You can go straight to fine sandpiper from here, or use medium before going on to fine. Finish up with the finest steel wool. You can oil the Rune with a good quality oil designed for wood. Some oil polishes and stains require you to steel wool the surface when wet, or soon after drying. Check the label to ensure perfect results. Once the Rune feels good to you, hold the stave in your right hand, look at it, and say: You became carrier of the powers of..... Tied to you is the power of the Rune. Sing the mantra of the Rune. Murmur the Song of the Rune if you are a student of the Order, or the stanza of the magical poem, if you are not familiar with the Song. Draw the Rune in the air with your dagger, power rod or wand. Next say: Powers of .....(Rune name) Thank you for your energy. Flow back to the Realms of Creation. Ground, and end the ceremonial, then go on to the next Rune stave. It is best to prepare one stave at a time. This takes a long time ... but you will end up with a well-charged set of Runes, fully tuned to you; well worth the effort that you put into it. If the set of Runes is for the group (castle or lodge), proceed similarly but have the group present or in mind while preparing the staves. As an alternative, all members of the group can assemble and finish the Runes in a group ceremonial using group energies. In this setting it is permissible for all the members to take part simultaneously each finishing one Rune at a time, until they are all done. It is important however that group staves are used for group practices only and that individuals' staves are used only by the person to whom they are tuned. The only exception is where a Rune master or Knight uses his or her own personal set for the ceremonials of the castle. Similar provisos apply to the use of Thor's Hammer. Whenever you use the staves, make sure that there is nobody around who may project negative energies or ideas, disbelief, hostility, and so forth, into your Rune staves. Should you suspect, or become aware of too much negative energy building up in your Runes, it will be necessary to de-ode, i.e. purify them, and then recharge them. Purification: Fumigate in frankincense, being aware that this action will remove all negative energy. Do this one Rune at a time. Recharging: Clear off a table and lay out the Runes in a circle, with EH and GIBOR in the middle. Establish your inner and outer Rune Realms, then recognize your Rune staves as part of the outer Rune Realms, which is your channel to the realms of creation and the universe. Beginning with FA, proceed from Rune to Rune as follows; 1) Look at the stave of the Rune. 2) Trace the Rune on the stave with a wooden pin, like a knitting needle, or skewer. While tracing, project energy through your arm, hand, and the pin into the Rune stave. Draw the energy from the universe with the other hand. 3) Chant the mantra of the Rune. 4) Recite the stanza of the Rune. 5) Meditate for a minute or two, then proceed to the next Rune. 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Rune Reading Ceremonial RUNE READINGS Keep in mind what we mentioned before, that Rune readings tell you of the energies from the realms of creation which are at the roots of the past, present, and future of the situation about which you want to know. Therefore, Rune readings tell you what energies you may use from those realms in order to deal positively with the situation under examination. As such, Rune readings become a valuable tool for the advanced Rune master. NEVER use your Rune staves to give purely worldly readings by neglecting what the Runes tell you about the deeper, spiritual side of the situation. Before you lay out the staves, the introductory ceremony will be very useful. It makes the vibrations right for a successful reading. Proceed as outlined in \"Rune Ceremonials.\" Place: Your altar, the altar of the castle or lodge; best of all set up in a natural setting in a magically strong place. Best times: Hour of sunrise, high noon, hour before sunset, midnight. Best days: Wednesday or Sunday, first day of a Rune period (Mal), sacred days, day before birthday of the person for whom the reading is being done. Direction: Look at the North...the location of YR and FA in the altar. Clothing: Robe, or if possible nude. Wear only magically meaningful metal objects, such as the Hammer of Thor, the Great Rune Talisman, dagger, or power rod. Participants: Only those for whom the reading is being done may be present. Magical Diary: If is important to make notes of the operation and the interpretations in your magical diary which is the best place for notes that must be of a confidential nature. THE READING CEREMONIAL INTRODUCTION 1. Setting of the Outer Realm The outer realm is the physical space in which you are working. It is your temple. The setup of your outer realm symbolizes the universe upon which you intend to operate. Be sure that you will not be disturbed,, and make sure that the room in which you are working is clean. You need an altar. A table will do. Arrange your ceremonial utensils as shown in the diagram Leave enough space for the candles and Rune staves which you use for the ceremonial. Set a circle of Rune staves around the tables large enough for you to be able to move around in it. Have the Runes EH and GIBOR on the table as shown. You may have a different Rune or Runes taken from the circle and put on the tables depending on what ceremonial you are performing. At the moment these are general purpose instructions. Set the cup with water, or thinned wine, as shown, together with the incense burner, one altar candle, Thor's hammer, and the Rune dagger. At this point, you are preparing the circle for the reading so the petitioner's candle is not yet positioned as in the diagram. This is where it will be a little later when the reading commences. You should have your book of ceremonials and your magical diary available. The look of the 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Rune Reading Ceremonial center of operations will differ, depending what ceremonial you are performing. but the diagram, without the petitioner's candle is a good general purpose arrangement. You may stand, or have a chair available for sitting in front of the table. Now you can set up the space in which you are going to work, your inner and outer Rune Realms. First, tune in to each Rune in the circle, singing the stanza of the magical poem for each Rune. As an alternative, you may listen to the students' tape, which establishes your inner Rune Realms, and connect each Rune of your inner Rune Realm with the corresponding Rune Stave in your outer Rune Realm. 2. Protective circle Next you take the Rune dagger, or power rod. First you trace the circle of Rune Staves around the table, then you draw the HAGAL Rune in all four directions beginning with the North (the FA Rune), and going counterclockwise through the West (RIT). South (IS), and then East (BAR). Each time you draw HAGAL in the air do so with the strongest possible image of protection and Oneness with the universe. Put the dagger or rod back at the side of the incense burner. 3. Light altar candle and say: \"Forces of the Light Eternal in the universe, Explore darkness! Sacred Flame shine, Bring Light to the night, All around darkness All around night I amidst the Light Darkness has to give Way to the Light' Original fire of FA Burning since the beginning Of times Light Force of AR Born in the Sun At the beginning of the worlds Give Light to the seeker!\" 4. Light incense and say: \"May the power of the Runes Lead me to a greater understanding Of the Universe and Myself,\" 5. Hold both hands over the cup with water or wine thinned with water. Be aware of the purpose of your ceremonial. Project in the water or wine the success of the reading and the beneficial effect of if on the querent. Know as you do this that the water or wine symbolize emotional strength. Project energy into the water or wine. 6. Look at Thor's Hammer. Be aware that this is the symbol of your capability of drawing, harnessing, and projecting Rune energies. Hold both hands over it. knowing of its power. Imagine it being sent to the realms of destiny from whence it returns with the Knowledge that you seek. 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Rune Reading Ceremonial Now, you are finished with all preparation and you are ready for the next step. 7. CEREMONY OF THE RUNE READING The realm of action is the circular area on your altar, indicated in the diagram on page 56. For the reading you do not place your personal Runes around in the usual circle. You shuffle them, face down, inside the realm of action. Set the petitioner's candle inside the circle, in the Northern direction, as shown in the diagram on page 56. Proceeding: 1) Light the candle of the petitioner, and say: \"This candle represents .....(name of the person for whom the reading is to be made), whose trends of destiny the Runes are to show.\" 2) Touch the Hammer of Thor and say: \"I am sending the Hammer of Thor to the Rune realms of Creation. May the Hammer of Thor bring back the wisdom of those realms.\" 3) Position of UR (hand or body) Tune in to the realm of UR. Sing the mantra of UR (3 or 9 times). Sing the stanza of UR. Say: \"With the power of UR I am seeing the roots of all fate.\" 4) Position of MAN Tune in to the realm of MAN. Sing the mantra of MAN (3 or 9 times). Sing the stanza of MAN.

You then end the ceremony by saying: \"Powers of the Runes Thank you for your advice. Flow back to the Realms of Creation.\" 10. Imagine, or visualize, the Rune energies grounding, flowing into the ground as water flows down a drain, or seeps into sandy soil. 11.

Note: The ceremonial setting gives the reading a very deep, spiritual background, which cannot be achieved by simple drawing Runes from a bag, or in other walls promoted in some of the recent books purporting to teach Rune Reading. It is the decision of the practitioner whether to access knowledge from the realms of creation, that will give insights into how present trends may be developed, or to give a psychic-fair type reading with all the superficiality of such. The energies present at the proper ceremonial setting give insights on levels other than the purely verbal. A reading should not be just words, talk about karma, or light entertainment. It should provide a DIRECT EXPERIENCE of the energies and powers that continually shape our destinies. 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Divinatory Meanings of the Runes The material that follows must be regarded as a basic alphabet from which sentences will be formed.

One skilled in the Tarot will find that a consideration of the correspondences with the major arcana will help to gain insights into the forces associated with Rune divination, A Cabbalist will find it useful to fit the Runes onto a hexagon with the FA-IS axis vertical. The correspondence of the three verticals of the hexagon with the pillars of the Tree will prove very seminal. A practitioner who uses crystals will be astonished at the increase in perceptions brought about by an alliance of the Runes with the crystals. There are notes on this matter in the Appendix because many people are familiar with crystal work. The hexagonal cross section of quartz and the fact that all of the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes are derived from the geometry of the hexagon is the basis of an enormous increase in crystal power when it is associated with Rune images.

The Runes NOD, IS, and FA were drawn, after the preliminary ceremonial that prepared the reader and petitioner for insights of a specific Kind. NOD An eighth one is mine: quite useful to hear For all the people in danger and need. Where hate should arise between man and man I settle it fast. Be aware that there is Karma working at the root of the situation, and it reaches back much further than the difficulties encountered in this lifetime. Use NOD to access this karma. Sing NOD aloud, and invoke NOD, and await what NOD will tell you. (At this point) the seeker, who was familiar with Rune ceremonials, had some flashbacks into former lifetimes and situations with some of the same people involved in the present difficulties. From these insights the seeker was capable of developing a basis from which to deal with the situation, NOD gave insight and the power to change. The two-way interaction between the petitioner and the Runes, and the subsequent empowering of the petitioner with a subtle, directed energy that cleared the way to helpful insights, is typical of a Sacred Futhork reading. Mere information and conjecture is more likely in other forms of Rune reading.) 1S A ninth one I know: if danger is out in the sea: To protect my dear ship I conjure the wind on the billowing floods And I sing into slumber the sea. You are not innocent of what's happening, as NOD has shown you. There is old karma that has to be worked out. How you are dealing with it at the present time is the question to be examined. It seems as though you are constantly being carried away by irritations, which form a nucleus around which your thoughts revolve, thus involving you more emotionally than the actual circumstances warrant. Because your emotions are tied to the astral level of energies, you are projecting these energies into the situation. This is not beneficial to yourself or the other persons concerned. You are in fact adding to this old Karma instead of settling it. It is possible for you to settle these Karmic debts without the other people having to be aware of it...they are fundamentalists. Tune into IS. Sing it aloud and be aware of the energies that are at the roots of your present behaviors. Be aware of your true ego, which has nothing to do with that ego associated with ego trips and illusions. (At this point the seeker became acutely aware of certain behavioral patterns that could modify the situation. He was capable of gaining spiritually on this basis, and discovered a new aspect of IS. FA I Know the songs that no wise woman Knows And none of the children of men. The first song is HELP, and help it will Against sorrow, hurt, and any distress. You may not do anything positive you may decide not to learn the lessons from the situation, and still you will receive help on the situation. It's stirring you up at the presents more than it should. The outcome will be positive in any case, since someone will help you. Yet the true message, which helps you solve the Karmic problem rather than the present, worldly one, is to use the fires of purification after you become aware of your true ego in relation to the whole matter. Visualize FA. Visualize its purifying fires, and sec them reach you in the not too distant future, so that you no longer need depend on outside help. You learned the lessons, you mastered the Karma of this situation, and now you are ready to help those who are still in need of your help; those whose hate aroused NOD. You 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Sample Reading know now how to help them, being purified yourself. They may be closed to higher wisdom, yet you lay the spark in them, and helpfully project the purifying fires of FA. Now you are no longer exposed to blind fate, or trends.

IMPORTANT: After giving the initial meaning, do not hesitate to WORK with the client on the solution of the problem, or situation, until all angles of the problem have been explored, and as many questions as possible have been satisfactorily answered. The 18 Sacred Futhork Runes should not be used for readings by a person who just wants to throw the Runes and look up the answers in a book. Many initiates don't even use the Runes for readings, there are so many other important and helpful things to do with them. Those who do use them for readings usually use the full ceremonial and treat the matter very seriously. They have their reward in the depths of the insights produced, and the changes made in the situations under examination. 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Crystals and the Runes CRYSTALS AND THE RUNES The properties of crystals have been much in the public awareness recently. Many of those who are finding out with great benefit the uses of crystals as instruments for concentrating power would find their work greatly enhanced by a study of the Runes. The symbolism of the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes is based on the geometry of the hexagon and its diameters. The powers of quartz crystals, too long practiced and documented to be denied, except by the ignorant, are also associated with the geometry of the hexagon. It is no coincidence therefore that THE ULTIMATE POWER OF CRYSTALS IS ACHIEVED WITH THEIR CONNECTION TO THE 18 SACRED FUTHORK RUNES. Even with the incoherent arrays of the 24 and 33 Rune systems, there can be an enhancement of effectiveness if the Rune practice is integrated with crystal work, whenever the shapes of the Runes being used can be derived from the standard hexagon. Ancient Runemasters talked about harnessing the energies of the world crystal when working with Runes. Ice and snow can be used, in suitable latitudes, in connection with quartz, or even alone, because of the hexagonal crystal formation in frozen water. Everyone has seen beautiful pictures of snowflakes as decorated hexagons of ice. Contemplation on the uniqueness of each of the billions of snowflakes that fall every year will help certain aspects of Rune work. Each Rune may be viewed as a partial energy of the great world crystal. Therefore, it is but a little step from using the crystal energies of quartz and other crystals to dynamize them with Runes, and eventually to incorporate those generators of energies into powerful Rune practices, as well as into the methods of crystal use. In fact, so powerful are some of these practices, that information about them is only available to those who have reached certain levels of practice and theory. Only trained and initiated Runemasters will penetrate some of these self-guarding secrets of Crystal Magic with Runes. In this section we mention a few ways of using crystals in Rune Magic. Any crystal user can read between the lines and see how the practice could enhance crystal working. If you look at a clear quartz crystal from the top, you will see the HAGAL Rune. Other Runes appear on quartz crystals if you look at them from different angles. The circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola can be seen in a transparent cone by one who has done some analytical geometry, or who can visualize sections of it. Similarly the Runes are not instantly obvious, but when they are seen, they indicate a whole cosmic geometry of their own. As the sections of a cone represent the planetary, galactic and interatomic orbits, thus representing the whole universe, from atom to Galaxy, so the Runes represent the energies of the universes, inner and outer, invisible and visible. For the most effective work with quartz crystals in Rune Magic, you need a set of crystals, which are dynamized with Runes. Such a set has the Runes engraved on crystals that are specifically selected for the Rune concerned, and several other crystals that serve as focal crystals and transmitters. Such a set of specially prepared crystal is not cheap, but it is worth the investment. You become equipped with a powerful tool that greatly enhances your Rune work in healing, charka development, spiritual insights, and wherever strong surges of controlled energy arc required. A Rune circle is a standard pattern used to enhance energies, and a simple experiment will demonstrate its effectiveness beyond any doubt. Take the set of crystals and arrange it as shown in the diagram. Take 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Crystals and the Runes care that the points on the crystals are distributed as shown. The center crystal should be pointed slightly upward, pointing towards and over the IS crystal. You can put a stave under it, or a small crystal, to raise the end slightly. Next, you feel the energy emanating from the center crystal. Some of the more advanced Rune Crystal arrangements are so strong that the energy of such arrangements compares to the energy from a single crystal the size of a house, or even larger. Notice carefully how far the energy of your arrangement reaches. Now take a crystal in your hand and feel its energy with your forehead, or your favorite method. Then point it down to the circle of Rune crystals and move it clockwise, against the arrows, so to speak. Then feel the energy again in the same way, and notice the strong surge that contact with the circle has provided. For healing (or practice with UR), you can use the same arrangement as in the diagram, but place the stave of UR on your center crystal. Then you can sit in front of the center crystal and the energies will reach you. You may practice in this way with any other Rune or combination of Runes. A much more advanced technique, for which you require the appropriate initiation, or assistance of a Runemaster, is called 'gridding. In this technique, several crystals of the same Rune or Rune Crystals from a second set are used for specific purposes. A safe, neutral example, that produces a strong, stabilizing and protective fields would be formed in the following way. Imagine a large HAGAL Rune drawn on your working surface and place six HAGAL Rune Crystals at right angles to the diameters and pointing consecutively counter clockwise. The ends of the diameters should touch the mid points of the horizontal crystals. Other patterns are much more potent than this one for specific purposes, and the advice of a Runemaster would be required for efficiency and safety. A book on Crystal Magic with Runes is now in preparation. For specific purposes consult your Runemaster. For healing work, make sure that you know the traditional correlations between the Runes and the spiritual anatomy that were dealt with on pages 34 and 35. Practices with Rune Mantras, murmuring, and meditations are all enhanced by the use of Rune Crystals. (Murmuring is a technical word used to describe the practice of reading inspired verses, specific to each Rune, in a low voice, during Rune ceremonies. Such an activity is practiced by the home study students of K.O.R.) A FINAL NOTE This elementary guide into some of the beauties of work with the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes should have allayed any fears that may possible have been present in the prospective student. Remember the Runes are life affirmative. They do not lead to being overly concerned with the IF and WHEN at the expense of the HERE and NOW. They lead you to recognize that you have no hope for the IF and WHEN unless you control the HERE and NOW from an eternal NOW, or an ever present PRESENT. Regardless of your levels, you can tune in to Rune experience. Whatever your level of Rune experience, there is always something beyond that level. Most students who are meant to experience Runes in this lifetime will have immediate experiences with their first step into the Rune Realms, Runes are energies so high and so deep that they transcend our notions of personification. They transcend any pictures or mappings that we try to make of them. Runes are a set of symbols, which evoke, and bring you into tune with realms of deepest mysteries. 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Crystals and the Runes Runes are a set of triggers, or switches, which help YOU to maneuver otherwise inaccessible transcendental energies. Runes can also be regarded as transcendental beings who communicate themselves to those qualified, ready, and worthy. There are as many approaches to getting acquainted with Runes as there are human beings. Experiment or advice from a Runemaster are necessary to find the approach best for you. Very useful in many instances is a group situation, where mutual sharing and joining of energies can contribute significantly to your overall progress. Some periods of working with Runes in unspoiled, natural surroundings, are often very beneficial to your ascendancy towards mastership. Your Runemaster will know the where and when of such matters.
