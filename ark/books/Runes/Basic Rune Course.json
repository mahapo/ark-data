A word about myself to the student of the courses"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Armanen runes Introduction I started my studies of Rune magic 1972 while in Berlin, Germany. I have written the Rune courses starting in 1982. These courses have striking differences to all other approaches to Rune magic that I have learned in the past. It is obvious that the Blavatskian-Theosophical pseudo-historical approach (to which most Rune Masters of the 20th century subscribed) is entirely bankrupt in many respects and totally untenable, if not ridiculous. History, biology, archaeology and other modern sciences tell an entirely different story than these ludicrous reveries of the first half of the 20th century about \"Atlantis\", \"root races\", \"Hyperboreans\" or the Hörbiger theories of a hollow world, which may have originated as an esoteric side-effect, perhaps \"philosophical justification\" of European colonialism, and to which only a few lunatics and a couple of \"secret lodges\" of our era, most of them with definite fascist undertones, are still subscribing. From the very beginning of my studies on, I have recognized the Runes as primary abstractions. In fact, their simplicity, and at the same time complex effects, pointed to the fact that these abstractions were of a pre-linguistic, in some situations even non-linguistic kind. This means that we can trace back this type of creative interaction with the environment to the earliest origins of humankind, even before language as we know it evolved. Approaching Runes this way, I could no longer treat Runes in the way that practically all authors of the past viewed them: namely as the Germanic substitute, alternative, or replacement, for the magical systems that are based on the Cabbala. This was the approach that has been reverberating throughout all Runic literature that I have studied, and it is so in most Runic literature still in our days. In fact, the simplicity of the Runic approach to magic and the fact that Runes were not as easily to control by some people as were the cabbalistic energies made me aware that there was a dimension to this ancient system that traditional magicians have overlooked - or of which they have not been aware at all, even if some of their practices sometimes included a few elements of this dimension, a dimension that reaches far beyond the language-based structures of the Cabbala. Having had this experience of Runes, I then decided to approach the Runes as creating and defining energies rather than created and well-defined ones. When I established this approach to Runes, which included the definition and use of the \"Rune Realms\" (see the Basic Rune Course, inner Rune Realm, outer Rune Realm and Rune Realm of creative energies) they naturally revealed their immense power to me and they did so instantly! In addition to that, they turned out to be relatively easy to control, since I approached them according to their nature: as energies belonging to the realms of creation, as defining energies rather than the typical cabbalistic ones that are well defined. I did not tie the Runes onto the \"Procrustes bed\" of cabbalistic thinking nor did I force the Runes into the mold of \"definitions\". Consequently I had easy access to the enormous power of the creative realms. These realms are beyond the well- defined planetary energies (or entities of the spheres in a Bardonian sense) and, in fact, you can use these creative energies as modifiers of such entities. This became very clear when I evoked Bardonian spirits and other entities inside a Runic circle. The Runes allowed the creation of energy fields (entities) with a power and flexibility that simply cannot appear when we work with the same energies without the impact of a connection to the realms of creation. This entirely new, and yet ancient, approach to Runes is the crux of my courses and the magical practice therein that you are going to study and apply. Naturally, I used the 18 Runes that Guido von List introduced. In fact, it did not take much practice to recognize their superiority over all other systems, including those of which their authors and promoters claim to be \"elder\". It certainly is obvious that List was onto something when he had his \"revelations\", without ever fully realizing just how powerful this system can be. After experiencing the creation-dimension of the Runes (above all the 18 Futhork Runes, i.e., the Armanen System), there is no way that we can speak ever again of a Rune magic besides the known cabbalistic methods or as a substitute of these methods based on Germanic religion. Quite to the contrary, the Armanen Futhork is a system of creative energies that naturally reaches far beyond the well-defined cabbalistic energies. We can use these qualitatively superior, defining and creating Runic energy fields to achieve our ultimate magical flexibility as human beings, either in conjunction with well-defined energies (\"Bardonian entities, cabbalistic spirits\", etc.) or independently from them. The far-reaching potential of this new method and new approach became obvious when, at some point (still while writing the lessons of the Basic Rune course under the aspect of this new approach) I evoked a Germanic god with a Rune. Before the god could manifest, the Rune asked me what god I wanted to create! 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Armanen runes Introduction As a consequence of the life force technology that I developed (I have built the first device on this planet that actually generates life force, i.e., the Chi Generator®, or generator of Od) and the explanation of magic, radionics, and the power of abstractions such as thought forms, gods, sigils, radionic settings, etc. (see my course \"Magick of the Future\"), the power of a Rune magic that is rooted in the realms of creation has increased significantly! A Rune can then become a creative energy that is continuously powered by life force coming from a Chi Generator®. You can direct the general effect of its action and define the outcome of the operation. The Rune (or bind-rune) will then be the ultimate thought-form that works independently and creatively towards the result with an efficiency that the traditional \"spirits\", \"familiars\", etc., certainly can never exhibit. When studying the courses, especially the Basic Rune Course, be aware of the power of the realms of creation that you learn to access with your first lesson. With this awareness, you will gain a maximum benefit from your studies and you certainly will have the practical experience that helps you understand and use the tremendous power of the Armanen Runes. Karl Hans Welz Runes And Religion Because of their power, Runes or Rune-like symbols, have been part of religious systems in the past as well as they are in present times. Therefore Runes cannot be considered to be the \"proprietary system\" of any specific religious creed, even if they were or are an important part of such a creed. Keep in mind that THE BASIC TECHNOLOGIES OF RUNE MAGIC ARE INDEPENDENT FROM ANY RELIGIOUS BELIEF STRUCTURE. TRUE RUNE MASTERS encourage incorporation of Runic practice in any religious system, provided that its teachings and actions encompass tolerance and love. We know that RUNES ARE FOR EVERY INTELLIGENT BEING IN THE UNIVERSE! The Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes are a symbolism that represents universal cosmic structures. They connect with the natural zodiac of creative energies the periodic system of chemical elements the world crystal, and crystal structures in general a Runic musical scale the system of numbers with the base 18 RUNES ARE COSMIC ENERGIES OF CREATION that connect you with the WORLD CRYSTAL. As such, you can see them as the basic elements of A MYSTICAL LANGUAGE THAT GIVES YOU ACCESS TO THE REALMS OF CREATION. Runes guarantee naturally that you can participate in the eternal processes of creating, re-creating, and shaping your destinies and your universes. EACH RUNE IS A SWITCH, OR TRIGGER, TO A SEED IDEA OF THE REALMS OF CREATION. Such a seed idea helps you to connect the un-speakable realms of creation with your world. This connection gives you the power to create wherever you wish to! Therefore, to combine Runes means to combine seed ideas expressed in the realms of creation and to practice Runes means to creatively act upon your universe! 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Armanen runes Introduction Runes are Symbols on Many Levels First, they carry a number that defines their position within the symbolism as a whole. A RUNIC NUMEROLOGY has emerged from this connection. Using this Runic numerology in combination with a RUNIC ASTROLOGY, you can find out which creative energies, or PERSONAL RUNES, exert the most dominant impact upon your present life. Second, each Rune is a symbol. You can draw or visualize this symbol. Each Runic symbol gives you access to the specific power of the Creative Realm it represents. The graphic symbols of the Runes connect with the WORLD CRYSTAL. They are representatives of the creative energies of the world crystal. The symbol of the world crystal is the hexagon with the three inscribed diameters. If you look at a regular quartz crystal from the top you will see this structure. Each Rune fits neatly into this symbol of the world crystal. Next, each Rune naturally connects with a MANTRA, OR WORD OF POWER. You can use this mantra to bring the power of the corresponding Rune into manifestation. You can use the RAD 2000 RU or RAD 2400 HD RU to generate Rune Mantras and to use these mantras for manifestation on all levels. Each Rune and combination of Runes does also connect with SPECIFIC SOUND FREQUENCIES. These frequencies are useful for healing, chakra balancing, and many other psychic practices. In the Rune Master Radionics Program, you can make use of these very special Runic sounds with their EIGHTEEN TONES IN THE OCTAVE and you wil naturally learn to cherish them! The Rune Master Radionics Program Make use of the creative energies of the universe and give the most powerful boost possible to your magick! It has six positions plus an Od transfer function. The Positions: Creative energy- Trend in the environment - Main trend - Target - Alternate target - Grounding. In addition, it has a position for the transfer of OD. 10 octaves with 18 Rune Tones each! Play the sound of the Rune of your choice and have the \"Hammer\" generator of Od vibrate in this exact frequency for this extra super boost of your rune Magick! HAND AND BODY POSTURES of Runes are another way to draw Rune energies. They are the basis for a powerful Rune Yoga. In connection with a Runic Hermetic Medicine, Rune Yoga is a powerful tool for healing on all levels. With a Chi Generator™, you can now give your Runes this extra power that has been achieved never before in history.

Consequently, they act fast and very powerfully. You can trigger them easily. Many of our students have experienced desired results fast, often overnight. Since they represent creative energies, Runes can help you to overcome negative karma. Unlike many religious belief systems, RUNES ARE LIFE-AFFIRMATIVE. RUNIC PRACTICE IS APPLIED METAPHYSICS. With Runic practice, YOU UNFOLD YOUR NATURAL ABILITIES that you have had all your life, but of which you may never have been aware. Runes allow you to flex your psychic muscle in the same way others may take advantage of their wealth, prestige, or position on the ladder of social success. If you are enjoying this latter advantage already, Runes can certainly boost your position and help you get still further ahead! Rune Masters believe that EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS A RIGHT TO HAPPINESS, health, peace of mind, prosperity, and abundance. There is enough out there to satisfy everyone. Rune Masters see it as their obligation to help others achieve that to which they are entitled. Rune Masters emphasize that a belief system, or religion, which concerns itself in the main with the IF AND WHEN at the expense of the HERE AND NOW is not worth any serious consideration. If you are unable to control your HERE AND NOW, you have no hope for the IF AND WHEN! The BASIC RUNE COURSE will teach you the means of taking care of your present situations, or challenges, be they emotional, material, mental, or spiritual. Above all, Rune Masters will emphasize practical, hands-on experience. We leave the teaching of lots of dogmas and \"secret wisdom lessons\", which you are supposed to accept blindly at the expense of direct evidence, to the twisted minds of the templemasters who are presiding the all-too-many \"ancient lodges\" of our times. Whenever it is necessary to present you with a theory, we follow the principle to keep it simple! Furthermore, we will never demand that you believe us blindly. In the BASIC RUNE COURSE and the other courses, you will find the means of checking for the truth in what you learn.

IT IS EXCLUSIVELY YOUR CHOICE! If you have followed more recent metaphysical trends, you know that there are many schools of Runic thought. Most of these schools have adopted various runic systems that contain 24 symbols and even more. I have no problem with the 24 Runes and I am quite happy that some of the runic groups in existence that follow obsolete doctrines are using the weaker system. For the serious student of the matter, however, I would like to set a few facts straight. Since Ralph Blum has published his \"Book of Runes,\" the metaphysically inclined public became increasingly interested in Runes. Blum's book was a big success, because it offered a washed down version of Runic practice that was custom tailored to the typical simple-mindedness of the run off the mill New-Ager. Blum certainly deserves a lot of credit for awakening the awareness of Runes (\"Rune Stones\") in many people who otherwise would have never known of this fine system. The success of Ralph Blum's book led to the usual consequences. Publishers hurried to throw on the market book after book. To fill an increasing interest of the public some publishers went even one step further. They contracted professional writers who had nothing but surface knowledge about Runes and whose main skill was concentrated on ripping off the ideas of others. Most of these publications have one common flaw: the self appointed \"expert\" writers had, like the successful Ralph Blum, no idea of the deeper side of Runic mysteries, let alone true experience or legitimate initiation. All too often students who believed the slogans of publishers became rapidly disappointed and frustrated, since most of the half baked fakers whose \"systems\" they studied could not deliver. One American author, Don Tyson and his publisher, Llewellyn, even boasted to be the first on the planet to ever have published Rune cards. Those good folks apparently were not aware that Karl Spiesberger's book included a deck of Rune cards. Spiesberger's book, with Rune cards, appeared on the German market some 35 years before Llewellyn's \"first deck\" creation and ludicrous claim. Spiesberger's book is a classic that even the typical mediocre \"expert\" of Runes should have known! Perhaps they lied for marketing purposes. Until quite recently, the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes were the main system of Runic practice in Germany. Then several excellent scholars began to search for Runic alphabets that may have predated the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes historically and they were developing a system of Rune magic from at leat one of them. This was an interesting venture indeed, especially since the origin of the Armanen Runes is based on insights of one single person, Guido con List. However, what's of an older age is not necessarily more useful, or more powerful. To fully understand the scope of what nonsense some these researchers conjured up, compare this venture with the general progress in technology throughout the ages. In our days, nobody in his or her right mind would use stone axes and live in caves, being convinced that such things are superior to the achievements of modern technology in dealing with the many challenges of modern life, just because such primitive technology is \"elder.\" True, most Runic arrays, even Blum's cooked-up system, are o.k. for divination, religious practice, and even for some simple magic. What they cannot do is bring you in touch with the deeper sides of Runic wisdom, and even less with the creative realms of the universe. This is so because not one of these arrays is a true symbolism. The most important characteristic of a true symbolism is that the position of each symbol in relation to every other symbol is of crucial importance. Consequently, once you know the esoteric structure of a symbolism and the meaning of one of its symbols, you are naturally capable to precisely establish the meanings of all other symbols. Another important characteristic of a true symbolism is that the energy of the symbolism as a whole is qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the sum total of its individual symbols. Systems that lack these characteristics are, often worthless, arrays of incoherent symbols and not true symbolisms. The symbolism of the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes has more than just one esoteric structure as its basis: 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Armanen runes Introduction The Hexagon with the three inscribed diameters: This figure is often referred to as \"the world crystal.\" In this figure, you can easily find every one of the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes. Crystal practices with the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes are very powerful! Of course, you will look in vain for a structural connection between a crystal and any one of the arrays of 24, 25, or even more \"runes.\" The two Runic zodiacs: The natural zodiac of 16 + 2 basic energies as found in many traditions such as the Wiccan tradition. The other zodiac is the ancient subdivision of the year in 18 sectors of 20 days each. The periodic system of chemical elements. This, too, connects with the number of the Sacred Futhork, 18. The first period has two elements, hydrogen and helium. The second period has eight elements, and the third period has eight elements. The total of the first three periods is 18. The fourth and fifth periods have 18 elements each! The implications of this cosmic relation are enormous. Again, there is no hope for a Runic alchemy, a Runic homeopathy, and other practices that connect with the vibrations of chemical elements for arrays of 24, 25, or more \"runes.\" From the above follows that the symbolism of the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes with its wide ranging correlations is esoterically much more meaningful and naturally more powerful than any of the arrays of Runic alphabets that the many modern day \"experts\" and Rune gurus describe so exhaustively. Those persons limit themselves stubbornly to the use of Runes for readings and for a few practices of \"religious magic\" that usually connects with some nostalgia of ancient religion. Usually they see their Runes as symbols that stand for some worldly and spiritual meanings. Others see in the Runes an expression of some ancient gods. True perhaps, but the fact that Runes reach way beyond the realm of the gods and that they give access to the realms of creation (realms where you can actually create your gods) escapes them all together, and so does the tremendous power that is contained in this ancient true symbolism. We know that the ancient Norse religion was the last religious system that included some Runic practice in its belief structures. We know also that Runes cannot be limited to be part of any one religious belief system. Because of their universal esoteric basis (some of which I have shown above) the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes are the basis for an esoteric and spiritual technology that can be of use for every intelligent being in the universe. Because of the superior power of this technology, many professional healers, psychics, occultists, and other persons who are in leading positions, are naturally drawn to the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes which they consider to be a most valuable asset.

Welcome to the Order of the Knights of Runes! This letter is the first of eighteen letters of Rune instruction that you will receive during your first phase of Rune practice. As a new member of the Knights of Runes you are going to embark on a fascinating journey that will lead you into the realms of the creative energies of the universe: the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes. Practicing the exercises of this course you will learn how to master the Runes. The Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes are a symbolism that represents the creative energies of the universe. As such the Runes are the keys that give you access to your inner creative powers. In each lesson of this exciting course, you will find new methods that help you to harness the infinite powers of the Runes for your advancement and to help others. Soon you will realize that your advancement is relatively easy, provided that you invest some time into your practice. Each of the eighteen lessons of the Basic Rune Course introduces you into one of the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes. You will work with these Runes in their natural order, beginning with the Rune FA in the first lesson and ending with GIBOR in the last lesson. With each of the letters of instruction, you will also receive one of the eighteen Rune Songs. These Rune Songs and letters of instruction are only available for student members of the Knights of Runes. Therefore it is imperative that you keep your materials of instruction confidential. I expect that you practice the exercises of every letter of instructions and then send your teacher a 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"lesson01 progress report. One of our Rune Masters will assist you in your studies and practice. You may ask him or her any question that may arise during your studies. This Rune Master will also monitor your progress and see that your work with the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes will be of optimal benefit for you. When you receive the sixth letter of instructions, of the Rune KA, you will be ready for initiation to be a Knight of Runes. This initiation gives you the right to be a full member of the KOR. With the last letter of instructions, you will be ready for initiation to be a Rune Master of the First Degree, or Baron of Runes. You may self-initiate or you may receive your initiation in a group setting. Many students who have no ties to any local group self-initiate first. Then, later, they will go through the same initiation with a group. Initiations and Empowerments You may self initiate to the ranks of Knight or Rune Master or you may decide to experience a group initiation. The instructions for these initiations are in the letters of the Runes KA (#6) and GIBOR (#18). An initiation however is more thorough if you receive it together with a Runic empowerment. This empowerment is a ceremony of direct and personal transfer of Runic wisdom that pertains to the degree of initiation. Such empowerment connects you with the lineage of Rune Masters. You will receive a special instruction before your empowerment. We will give you the places, dates, and times, of empowerments upon request. About your Studies and Membership Before you begin to practice, it is necessary that you know a few important things about the course. In the letters of instruction you will find directions of how frequently you should practice and what practice you should do. You need to understand these instructions as suggested guidelines. It is always good for you to proceed at your own speed. It will also be useful that you consult with your Rune Master after you had your first experiences. If there is a need, you will receive additional guidelines that your teacher will adjust to your special needs and talents. Do not ever hesitate to ask for guidance in your studies! Membership in the Order of the Knights of Runes opens up new dimensions of \"chivalry\" in its true meaning. This means responsibility toward other living beings, love, support, and true tolerance. In return, members receive additional creative means to enhance the power of their Runic practices. For this reason, only members of the Order are entitled to receive the Rune Songs. The songs of the Runes -- such as the Song of Fa that you received with your first letter of instructions -- are powerful means of helping you on your path toward mastery of Runes. These songs seem to be more explanatory than Odin's Rune Song or the verses of the Magical Poem. They do contain a deep symbolic language that gradually opens you up to the many levels of the creative realms. This will be evident as you continue to practice with these songs. Therefore it is very important that you practice the murmuring of the Rune Songs on a regular basis. This practice will introduce you to new dimensions -- or meanings -- 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"lesson01 of the specific realm of the Rune of the Song. This practice will also open you up to an expanded view about the universe in general and of the creative realms of Runic energies in particular. Practice of the Rune Songs will give you awareness of the function and power of symbolisms in general. More importantly, this practice will smoothly introduce you to the function and power of the symbolism of the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes. Murmuring or singing these Songs on a regular basis will enhance your skills in Runic practice as well as this practice will expand your insights in areas that are not immediately evident at a first reading of these Songs. Regular practice of the Songs is a powerful help for you to advance swiftly and safely to full mastery of the Runes. Many students have reported that murmuring of the Rune songs on a regular basis has developed and sharpened their psychic perception considerably. Most students experience rapid progress. This is so, above all, at the beginning of Runic practice when the student opens up to the energies of the realms of creation. This rapid opening up is a great thing, because it helps you get immediate evidence of the power of this ancient system of initiation. If this happens, you may be encouraged to such a degree that you expect outright miracles every time you practice. Many students, especially at the beginning, need to realize that it takes much practice and a lot of tuning into the Runic energies to become a master. Although initial progress is swift, there is no such thing as \"instant runes\" in the fashion of promises to lure you into a cute and cozy New Age weekend seminar. Runes are more than such surface knowledge! Therefore, even after an initial jump-start, you need to be aware that you acquire skills and mastery only after the appropriate time of study, persistence, and practice. Psychic training and runes are no exception. As a beginner, you may truly be excited when progress is initially swift. This is good so. Then all of a sudden everything seems to come to stagnation and even to a complete standstill. This is not a sign of alarm at all! You need to know that progress and advancement happen at more subtle levels at times of seeming stagnation. These subtle levels are not always obvious to the beginner. With all the initial excitement, never forget that it will take at least six lessons to familiarize yourself with Runes to a degree that allows you to properly use their creative energies. Even remarkable results right at the beginning are no contradiction to this truth. Never overestimate your powers after you have a few extraordinary initial experiences. Be assured that you will have such experiences in the first part of your studies and practice. Conversely, when you feel at times that there is no progress at all, be confident that you need periods of creative rest when the process of advancement happens subtly at your non conscious levels. During these times, the parts of your mind that are non conscious will recollect all that you have learned and they help you to fully assimilate the essence of your practice and experiences of Runes. About Symbols and Symbolisms in the Rune Songs and Rune Poems \"The ancient peoples used the vehicle of mythology to describe that which belongs to the realms of the psyche, the religious, and the spiritual.\" (Piobb, Formulaire de Haute Magie) 1. Odin's Rune Song I know myself hanging on the wind cold tree for nine icy nights. Wounded by the spear, consecrated to Wodan I consecrated to myself. I was hanging on the mighty tree which conceals man Where man grew out of its roots. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"lesson01 They offered me neither bread nor wine So I bent down in search. I recognized the Runes; wailingly I grasped them. Until I sank down from the tree. Now I began to increase, to be wise, To grow and to feel well. From the word, word grew after word And deed shaped to deeds with deeds. Now I know the songs like no wise one knows And none of the children of men. And should these songs, o human child, be unlearnables to you for sheer endless time; Grasp them as you get hold of them, use them as you hear of them. Hail you if you retain them! The Song of Odin, the Magical Poem, the Rune Songs and the structures of Runic ceremonials, contain deep cryptic and symbolic significance. The writers of the songs and poems used such language to describe that which pertains to the realms of the physio-psychic, the metaphysical, the hyper physical, and the transcendental. They used ritual to bring about experience of things that words cannot describe easily. Odin's Rune Song and the eighteen stanzas of the Magical Poem (see lesson 3) show clearly the initiatic content of the powerful ancient tradition of the Runes. The more you advance in your opening up to the Runes and consequently to metaphysical truth, the more you will gain an understanding of these songs and the more you will benefit from the deep symbolic truths and evocative meanings that are contained in the Runic documents such as Odin's Rune Song and the Magical Poem. With this opening up you will be ever more capable of harnessing the creative powers of the Runes. The hidden and esoteric language of the Rune Songs, the Magical Poem, etc., will remain a secret to persons who did not receive an initiation in the knowledge of the Runes. For the initiated they are an open book. The initiated can read from this book whenever they wish to do so. However, even the non initiated person will benefit from these Runic documents. He/she will benefit on more subtle levels. The language in the Runic documents is to remain a secret to persons who prefer to read surface knowledge but decide not to practice. A typical reaction of some of such well meaning beginners is the accusation of \"sexism\" in the Runic documents. These folks are still unaware of the symbols that initiates use to describe the interplay of light energy with life energy. Runic knowledge is powerful knowledge that self protects. The symbolic language of the Runic documents keeps the careless, the unwary, and the non initiated from meddling with the powerful Runic energies and from dabbling with powers that they may not be capable of handling properly. Therefore the cryptic language in Runic documents is structured and presented in a way to provide you step by step with an understanding of Runic energies and with the tools to use these powers of creation properly. A good example of self-protection of this powerful knowledge and of the power of \"hiding in symbols\" is the fact that folks of the less savory kind (racist revivalists of Norse religion) that practice Runes are totally convinced of the \"truth\" of an inferior system, i.e., the so-called \"Elder Futhark.\" You may best compare the symbolic language of the Runic documents to the symbolic language of the scientist. It is well-known that not everybody can understand scientific language such as chemical formulas and mathematical equations. Only the person who is \"initiated\" in a science is capable of understanding its 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"lesson01 language. Therefore only the person who is initiated in the science is capable of handling potentially dangerous things such as chemical compounds, physical energies, biological organisms, nuclear energies, and the like. One has to learn chemistry and its \"esoteric\" language (esoteric for the non initiated) to be allowed to work with chemical compounds. The chemical formulas are a secret language to a person who has never learned anything about this science. The trained chemist on the other hand finds a treasure chest of information in a book that is filled with chemical formulas. Enough was said here. Now the decision to open up to new energies of the creative realms lies with you. This opening up takes time and insight. Give it a chance and soon the mysterious Rune Songs will be an open book for you from which you can gather ever more valuable insights about yourself and the universe. These songs are more flexible than many works of natural science. This is so for the following reason: it does not matter at what point of your spiritual evolution you are. You will always find new information in these Runic documents. Besides a good working knowledge of Runic energies, this course will provide you with something still more exciting: You will acquire the necessary tools for a very important task: to advance to an understanding of the deepest mysteries of the universe in your never ending quest of Oneness with the Divine, or with Yourself. Access Keywords, Meanings, and Correlations of the Runes FA and UR The Rune FA Fa is the Rune of original fire. It is a Rune that symbolizes the cosmos and the universe. FA symbolizes fire that acts creatively. It is will that sparks manifestation down to the material levels. FA is one of the Runes that rules the Salamanders, spirits of the fire element. It symbolizes change from within the creative levels and spiritual creation. FA represents the Phoenix that rises from its ashes. It is a Rune of fate, of mobility, and of wealth. Uses of FA: You can use Fa to attract and absorb Solar and Lunar energy as well as the energies of the planets and fixed stars. Practice this absorption of energy with the body posture of FA. FA also strengthens the personal magnetism. On the etheric planes it symbolizes the electric fluid. Practice of FA strengthens the spiritual powers. It is useful at the beginning of any healing. Fa is one of the Runes that you use to transfer energies. It is helpful in your practice to unfold the original fire. Time of the Year: December 22 through January 12.

The Rune UR UR is the Rune of original cause of cosmic and planetary events. It is the Rune of original time. It is time at the threshold of creation: time-less time where space-time is irrelevant. UR connects with cause of causes, with original creation, with original immortality, and with original law of vibration. UR is the threshold of creation that Fa energizes with its impulse. It is creation for which created deities (or, even more ridiculous, anthropomorphic collective egregors of religions) take undeserved credit. It is original knowledge. Mythologically speaking the roots of the world tree, Yggdrasil, are in UR. It is here where the tree Norns, goddesses of fate and destiny, are spinning the threads of the web of time that determines the fates of humans and of gods. Here the fountain of wisdom is running to which the gods (think also of the gods within!) descend to gain knowledge and wisdom. Uses: From UR is coming forth continuously new existence. On the etheric levels it represents the healing Orgone energy and its structural linkages and magical uses. UR opens clair audience. Work with UR increases your capability to recognize the true origin, or root, of the universe and the true causes of everything. Practice of UR strengthens your healing energies. Time of the year: January 13 through February 3 Runic Zodiac of 18: 20 degrees Capricorn to 10 degrees Aquarius. Number: 2 Mantra: oo - oo - oo - oo rrrr. Emphasis on the oo-sound! The Rune Realms Before you begin your practice with Runes it is good to establish within yourself a space where you can work. It is also useful to set up a symbolic arrangement outside yourself, in your room. This arrangement may be a circle of Runes, of crystal runes, candles, incense burner, etc. You use this set up to facilitate 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"lesson01 your drawing and projecting of Runic energies. The set up outside yourself, or your temple room, is your outer Rune realm. The workspace that you establish within yourself is your inner Rune realm. The Rune realm of creation is the realm from which you draw your Runic energies. With your imagination you connect all three Rune realms. When your capability of visualization will be sufficiently advanced you may see the tree Rune realms connected with the axis of the (multidimensional) world tree, where the distance between the three Rune realms is perfectly equal. At that point you will also aware that your inner Rune realm is not completely inside yourself, your outer Rune realm is not completely outside, and by no means is the Rune realm of creation some isolated entity far away. Quite to the contrary, the three Rune realms permeate each other. With your practice you will more and more see these three realms as different expressions of one and the same thing. As you progress in this way you will increase your power to harness the Runic energies for anything you desire. The Outer Rune realm For the time being, you set up your outer Rune realms with the appropriate utensils. As a future Rune Master you need to know that repeated use of the same utensil attaches to them energies of a higher order. Once these energies are attached to the utensil, you need no longer call on them when you desire to use them. Being aware of the utensil does the same much faster. This allows you to have your conscious mind free for other things. Consequently your magic is more powerful. Ceremonial utensils compare to machines on the material planes. Contrary to material machines, ceremonial utensils are machines that reach into the planes beyond the material ones. In this respect, you can see ceremonial utensils as focal points that you use to have impact upon planes of finer densities. Later you will learn how to establish utensils of subtle energy. These subtle utensils make material ones unnecessary. To understand this better, I recommend that you study the course \"Magic of the Future.\" This course will also give you a good understanding of the CFP (common functioning principle) of all magic and of the energetic background of magical operations: life energy. With this course you will have a significant tool to advance rapidly towards your goals of magical and runic mastery! A very good set of utensils is one that symbolizes the four elements. Such a set should be on every altar. I suggest the following utensils for the elements: Use candles to represent the fire element, the causal plane, and your will. Use a cup with water or wine to represent the water element, the astral world and your emotional powers. Use a dagger as an active representation of the air element, the mental planes, and your mind. Use incense as a passive representation of the air element, the mental planes, and your mind. Use the Hammer of Thor as an active representation of the earth element, the material planes, and your consciousness. Use earth, bread, or a crystal as a passive representation of the earth element, the material planes, and 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"lesson01 your consciousness. When you align the four elements of will, emotions, mind, and consciousness, you can perform anything. To align these elements means to direct your will, emotions, mind, and consciousness, at the same goal. To achieve the skill of alignment of the four elements, I recommend that you study and practice the six lesson course \"A course in Cosmic Consciousness\" by Karl Hans Welz. A very important feature of the outer Rune realm is protection. In most magical traditions protection is symbolized by a circle that is traced, or imagined, around the practicing magus. For the protection to be powerful, your imagination needs to go beyond a mere circle. The least you need to do is envision a bubble that surrounds you. The circle represents your universe of which you are the Divine principle in the act of creation. Consequently you rule the creative energies of this universe. There can be no strong outer Rune realm without a set of Rune Staves. You arrange these staves in a circle around yourself. You begin with Fa in the North. Then you continue counterclockwise with all eighteen Runes all the way through GIBOR, which will be on the right side of Fa. If you practice with one or more Runes you take them out of the circle and put them on the altar in front of you. You should make your Rune staves yourself if you have the time and patience to do so. You find instructions of how to make your wooden Rune staves in the Rune Reading course. The Rune staves in the circle represent the creative energies in the universe. They connect with the Runes in the realms of creation as well as with the Runes in your inner Rune realm. In later lessons you will learn other rituals that are useful to establish and strengthen your outer Rune realm. At present it is sufficient if you set up this realm and focus shortly on each Rune, one by one, before each Runic practice. This will gradually increase the power of your outer Rune realm and its utensils. In group work this focus is done by chanting the eighteen Runes, one by one. The Inner Rune Realm After you established the outer Rune realm you continue with establishing your inner Rune realm. Later you will be capable of establishing your inner Rune realm without establishing the outer Rune realm first. If you do so at present, the effects will be more on a mental level. If for some reason you cannot set up an outer realm, light a least a candle as a focal point or miniature Rune realm and draw the eighteen Runes around it. Failure to properly establish an outer Rune realm can easily lead to failure in beginning Runic work! You shape your inner Rune realm with your powers of imagination. Within yourself you set up a workspace. In this space you see the Runes around yourself. You know of the connection of both, the inner and outer Rune realms, with the Rune realm of creation. You need to practice so that you can establish your inner Rune realm. You continue as follows: 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"lesson01 1. Bring yourself in a comfortable position. If you do more than practice, set a circle of Runes around yourself as an outer Rune realm. 2. Relax your body and mind. You may use some form of progressive relaxation. Much better yet, use methods autogenic training. These methods are superior to the progressive relaxation methods. You may order a six-lesson course, Autogenic Training, from the KOR. 3. Imagine yourself being in a place that you consider to be appropriate for the inner Rune realm. This place may be a peaceful clearing in the woods, perhaps with a brook running through it. It may be on a quiet beach, on to of a mountain, in an old temple, or anything else that suits you. This place is your place of power and you are the ruler of this your universe. For your convenience and for easier access to the inner Rune realm you may order a tape \"Establishing your Inner Rune Realm\" from the Knights of Runes. Once you have established your inner Rune realm, you see yourself fully protected. This protection connects with the protective measures in your outer Rune realm (the bubble). In your inner Rune realm, you imagine a circle of Runes around yourself. These Runes may be giant stones, wooden staves, crystals, or anything else on which the Runes are inscribed. They are arranged in the same manner as the Runes in your outer Rune realm. Sometimes it is helpful to imagine the Runes around yourself in a glowing light. This glowing light indicates that the Runes draw their charge from the realms of creation. This charge flows over to the Runes of the outer realm. Being the Rune master of the universe that you have established in this way, you are aware that you are its absolute ruler. Better yet, surround the Runes with light that pulsates. This way the Runes get their own life much faster! After you have established your inner Rune realm, you may operate from there on a purely mental level. If your outer Rune realm is also present, then you keep awareness of the inner Rune realm present and you can now begin with any Runic, or other, ritual of your choice. It is necessary that you practice the establishing of your inner Rune realm until you have mastered it to the extent that you can establish it within a few seconds. To reach this point, the mastery of autogenic training is far more advantageous than the usual progressive relaxation methods. Body postures and hand positions of the Runes By now you should now that Runes are creative energies that connect with simple structures. In other words, specific structures will trigger Runic energies from the realms of creation. The graphic representation of each Rune fits the hexagon with the three inscribed diameters. This figure is often referred to as the World Crystal. The realm of structures, however, is not limited solely to structures that we can draw with a pencil. Structure appears to us in many forms in any sensory perception to which we are able and in any 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"lesson01 combination of sensory perception. Therefore, if we have a system of structural representations such as the Runic alphabet, the cabalistic system, or the Tarot, we can express the same structural system in a myriad of media other than pencil and paper. You know already of a few of the structures that give you access to Runic energies: The graphical outline that fits the hexagon with the three inscribed diameters. The Runic sounds that you can express with your voice, i.e., the system of Runic mantras. The connection with the field that surrounds the Earth. This connection is the basis of a natural zodiac of 18 creative energies. The connection with the numeric system that ascribes one specific number to each Rune. You need to learn other structures that connect with the Runes. Among the most important are: Runic sound pitches that are expressed with a Runic scale: Eighteen creative energies within the octave. Runic colors that connect with the spectrum of colors. Red for FA through red-violet for GIBOR. A connection with the periodic system of elements: 2 - 8 - 8 - 18 - 18! A system of smells, as expressed by specific Runic incenses. Hand positions that connect with specific Runic energies. Body postures that you can use to draw and project Runic energies. Specific breathing rhythms that connect with Runes. Poems and Songs that connect with Runes. And a lot more! The imagination of the Rune Master is the limit! In the following you will learn about body postures and hand positions of Runes. This way of expressing Runes is a very powerful method to gain access to their creative energies. Any combination of Runic structures will enhance the effect of the Rune. Therefore, if you visualize the graphic shape of the Rune in the color of the Rune while you chant the mantra of the Rune, you will have more power available than you would have by visualization alone. If, along with this, you practice the body posture of the Rune while you have the exact sound pitch of the Rune played in the background, you gain even more power. Add to this a good amount of life energy (see the course \"Magic of the Future\" where you learn how to perceive and direct life energies) and you will be ready for a magical action so powerful that hardly anything can withstand it! Body and hand postures connect you with the Runic energy they represent. You draw Runic energy into yourself and into the space that surrounds you when you practice a body or hand posture. These postures establish a direct link to the Runic realms of creation. You are the Rune while your body is in a posture that represents it. Body postures of Runes are very powerful tools in a ceremonial setting when several persons stand in such a way that they form the graphical outline of the Rune on the floor. In the following you will learn the hand and body postures of the Runes from FA, UR, IS, and MAN. The Rune FA 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"lesson01 Body Posture: Standing upright, with the feet together, you point both arms forward and upward at an angle of approximately 30 degrees. The left arm is slightly higher than the right arm. Both palms are open to the front, drawing in energy. Hand Position: The left arm points straight up. The thumb and ring finger form the two side-branches of the Rune FA. The other fingers point upward. The Rune UR Body Posture: Bending over, your arms and fingertips point toward the ground. Hand Position: Practice with the left or with the right hand. Position #1: Form the U-shape with your fingers. The open end of the U is pointing downward. Hold the hand approximately 8 inches from the center between your eyes. Position #2: Thumb and index finger shape the UR pointing downward. The other fingers point in the same direction as the index finger. The Rune IS Body Posture: Standing upright, your feet touch each other, the arms hang down on the sides. 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"lesson01 Variation: Same position, but the arms point upward, with the palms facing each other. Hand Position: Make a fist, with the index finger pointing upward. The Rune MAN Body Posture: Both arms are stretched upward to the side, at an angle of 30 degrees. You feel the influx of energy on both sides. Direct the energy to the ground. Variation: Kneeling, sit on your heels. The arms take the same position. Hand Position: Thumb, index and middle fingers shape Man. Rune Mantras A very powerful way of harnessing the creative energies of the Runes is the singing of Rune mantras. Especially the beginning student of Runes will experience the power of Runic energies in a very short time when she or he practices the singing of the mantras of Runes that are in harmony with the student's personality. For a small fee we can derive your personal Runes from your name and birth data. To sing Runes is to sing mantras of power. Once you sing a Rune consciously and the correct way, then you turn on a switch that gives you access to the transcendental energies of the Rune. This will happen whether it is your intention or not. Then the Runes will communicate to you gradually how you can 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"lesson01 manage and how you can use these energies, provided you are spiritually ready to accept the Runes and to overcome the bondage of the self imposed limitations and restrictions of the world tree. Once in tune with the creative energies (yes, this takes some practice!) you may harness them for your goals. Singing Runes will advance you on your path to mastery of these powerful creative energies. The KOR tape on Rune mantras will help you pronounce the Runes the correct way. This tape also contains additional valuable hints of how to trigger Runes by singing their mantras. Practice of the Rune Fa You can use the following practice for all eighteen Runes. It will bring you in contact with the realm of the Rune and with its creative energies. You proceed as follows: 1. Make sure that there is no undesirable outside interference. 2. Sit in a comfortable position. 3. Bring yourself into a relaxed and meditative state. 4. Establish your inner Rune realm. 5. Sing \"fffffffffffaaaa\" while strongly visualizing the outline of the Rune Fa. 6. Say the Song of Fa (see at the end of this lesson) in a low, murmuring, voice. 7. While you murmur you see yourself in your inner Rune realm. 8. Imagine that this inner Rune realm is filled with the energy of Fa. 9. See the symbol of Fa in your inner Rune realm. 10. Imagine that more and more energy of Fa flows into your inner rune realm. 11. Stand up and practice the body position of Fa. 12. Sing the mantra of FA (\"ffffffaaaaaa\") five times while you draw the energies of FA through the palms of your hands into your body. After this practice sit down and wait for thoughts and insights to come and feelings to develop. You may get some body sensations of your inner eye may see pictures. Perhaps sounds manifest in your inner ear. It is not necessary that you dwell on any of these experiences. Should there be less of an effect than you anticipated you need not worry. Keep practicing! After a few minutes of meditation you should imagine that the energies of Fa that surround you drain into the ground and flow back to the realms of creation. This practice of grounding all surplus energy is a good way to avoid overcharging yourself and the space around yourself. As you keep practicing your understanding of the realm of the Rune will increase. Exercises: The following is a set of exercises that you should practice before you go on to study your next lesson. 1. Murmur the Song of Fa (at the end of this lesson, if you are a KOR member) in a good setting, at least twice a week. 2. Practice the body posture and hand position of FA and feel the energies in your body. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"lesson01 3. Learn to establish your inner Rune realm. 4. Practice FA as described in the previous chapter. 5. Send your progress report to your Rune Master and write about your first experiences with this course. 6. Order lesson #3 (the Rune Thorn). 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"lesson02 Letter of Instructions # 2 The Rune UR by Karl Hans Welz Welcome! I assume that you have studied thoroughly the lesson of FA. Before you continue now with this lesson it is important that you did have established your inner Rune realm and that you are now capable of establishing it whenever you desire to do so. Should you have met any difficulties in establishing your inner Rune realm or in connecting it with the other Rune realms give your rune master a call or send e- mail. This tape will guide you into establishing your inner Rune realm. I do not assume that you have any problems with your outer realm. You should also have sent your progress report to your Rune master, mail or e-mail. Include in this progress report your experiences of Runic practice that you would like to share. About the Rune UR UR is the second Rune of the Sacred Futhork. It brings you in touch with the All-Mother-God principle while FA brought you in touch with the All-Father-God principle. UR represents the creative principles of the causes of space-time, dimensions, and existence. This creative principle reaches into the realms of causes of causes. UR can truly be called the space-less and time-less root of space-time. Being the roots, UR is the perfect Rune for healing on all levels and planes. This is so because UR allows you to modify any problem at the root of its causes, especially after you have learned to work with Runes on the non-verbal levels. 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"lesson02 More about Runes Before I continue with the specifics of UR, I want to share with you some more thoughts about the Runes of the Sacred Futhork. Quite often I refer to the Runes as being triggers that will communicate their meanings and effects with you on a non verbal level. These characteristics, of course, represent only one set of aspects of the Runes. In this respect, Runes have an important characteristic. Regardless how much you describe of them, there will always be things that you can still learn from them. Whatever descriptions of Runes you may produce, this description will never be all that Runes are. Runes are energies of creation that operate from the un-speakable objective realms of creation. They belong to realms that lie beyond the universe that most human beings are used to describe with their words and logic. Runes are truly beyond all known concepts of the universe and beyond all known mappings of the universe. It does not matter how you see Runes at the time when you work with them. You may see them as energies, as triggers of energies, as spiritual entities, as gods (as long as you do not fall in the trap of actually worshipping them -- leave that to the Odinists!), as mantras, or as a combination of all of this. Runes will still remain beyond any verbal descriptions that the human mind could produce. Therefore Runic practice and Runic experience reach into realms that are beyond description and beyond words. They are on the un-speakable objective levels of creative reality. For this reason, it is considerably more important to practice Runes than to describe them. With practice you will connect with the creative realms of each Rune. Every Rune connects with worlds of creation and formation. Therefore you may expect material results that correspond to the meanings of a specific Rune whenever you work with this Rune. Practice with the Runes will teach you soon that the most powerful methods of magic are also the ones that are the simplest ones. In fact, most powerful methods are of such a simplicity that most people cannot comprehend. As a result of this lack of comprehension due to simplicity, many persons tend to practice for decades to acquire skills that they could have mastered within a very short time. Simplicity seems not to be the thing that the average person can accept easily. The general opinion is that, for something to be powerful, it ought to be difficult to master. You should be aware of the fact that the deepest mysteries are often the easiest ones to grasp, but also that these deep mysteries self protect against misuse and profanation. Healing and UR Runic practice is a direct route to your Higher Self. It takes this route through the awakening of what some Rune magicians refer to as the Odin consciousness within. The Rune master strives to achieve in a few lifetimes that for which the masses of human beings on this planet may need thousands of lifetimes. He or she strives to evolve into a higher form of existence. For this pursuit, the creative powers of the Runes are an ideal tool. This is so, because the energy of the Runes brings you in contact with the creative forces of the universe. At present our planet is on a relatively low stage of its evolution. This low stage is also a fantastic opportunity for those who are willing to work on themselves. Some claim that human beings are again at the brink of collectively failing yet another karmic test at a beginning of a new precessional age. In their opinion, success or failure at this crucial time will determine the general development that our planet is heading to. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"lesson02 For this reason a general healing of the planet as a whole is more needed than ever before. It is everybody's responsibility to contribute to the ultimate success in the tests of our collective planetary karma. To heal is a responsibility that nobody can dismiss lightly! A true healing at the onset of this new precessional age means to bring about a change for the better for the planet as a whole. To cause such a healing of planetary dimensions, activity on the levels of creation is necessary. Moreover, such a healing is the task of a large group of human beings: many of us, not just a few! When you intend to participate in the healing of our planet, you need to first heal yourself! To do this, you need to re-evaluate your position within the web of life on this planet. Healing yourself also means that you need to strengthen and empower your individual consciousness before you take it upon yourself to help in the collective empowerment. It makes no sense at all to boost the collective consciousness at the expense of a person's individuality and then expect that this person acts responsibly. Centuries old experience has taught us that the way of conditioning people in such a direction of collectivization has produced not much more than mindless zombies. This way of organized religion is hopelessly bankrupt. The \"cosmic experience\" that such a brainwashed person may reach in a religious setting is worthless at best. In most cases religious experience is utterly unhygienic when seen under the aspect of life energy processes and sex-economy of the living being! The truly powerful person transcends the polarities of individual consciousness versus collective consciousness into an all encompassing state of being where such artificial division disappears. Heal yourself to the point that you love yourself first and foremost! Then it is easy to proceed to the universal love that encompasses the being as a whole -- your true ego! It is unfortunate but true that in no system of organized religion you can find awareness of the tools of the workshop of creation. The leaders of organized religion have not the slightest idea of access to these tools, let alone their proper use and power! True, in organized religion you will find some hint here and there of the necessity of a global healing. Most of these hints, of course, claim also that universal acceptance of the specific dogma of that creed alone can bring about such a global healing. Thousands of doomsday philosophies with elitist undertones evolved from such misunderstanding. The consequence is that one religion crusades against the other and each one of the religions considers all others false. The best way of dealing with this mess is to stay out. Just say NO to religion! We hear a lot of gobbledigook concerning global healing from the various New Age groups. I know of no such group that gives workable suggestions for the individual as to how he or she may contribute to better the karma of this planet. Sending \"light\" is not enough! Christian sects did something similar: They have prayed to their god for world peace for centuries. We all know the results. All there is, are thousands of false prophecies about tribulations, sinking coastlines, Atlantis emerging and other doomsday expectation that exceed even the false prophecies of the witnesses of Jehovah as far as their sheer amount as well as their idiocies are concerned. None of them ever came to pass. A true healing comes from each individual rather than from some sudden shift of the earth's axis, widespread flooding, being saved by exoterrestrials, and the like! It is the collective effort of individuals that can clean up the debris of negative karma that has accumulated throughout the ages. It is time that we recognize and use the tools of creation for our own benefit. These tools have been entrusted to us from the very roots (I say roots of time, not beginning of time!) of time on, so that we are capable of to master our destinies and with it the destiny of our planet. It is amazing how many human beings are not even aware of this gift that they possess. Read attentively the Song of UR at the end of this lesson so that your understanding of the nature of 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"lesson02 healing on levels will awaken in you, grow, and expand. Such a new understanding will open up new dimensions for you. You will then become increasingly aware of the extent to which a general healing will take place on this planet. There is truly a lot to be done by every responsible human being. Practice of UR will have another effect on you: It will bring about an understanding of the fact that the elimination of the Mother God Principle from human thinking has deprived mankind of the access to the very tools of the workshop of creation. This is a lesson to be learned from many old myths such as Adam and Eve, Lilith, Tiamat, and others. Practice with UR will expand your understanding until your whole being is imbued with the concept of All Mother God as an equal of All Father God. Then you may perhaps realize that the myth of original sin may have been generated by some male deity of a lower order! Such a deity was well aware that the easiest way to control people is to control and restrict their sexuality. The Book of Ceremonials The book of ceremonials is an important tool for your practice with Runes. This is so even in our times that have the advantages of computers, tapes, and printed materials. It is the process of writing down things by yourself that makes this book such an important tool. Therefore, the book of ceremonials is your book into which you write your versions of ceremonials, your individual ideas of how you set up your ceremonial so that this ceremonial has the strongest possible effect upon your universe. Nothing compares to your own handwritten documentation that your book of ceremonial is going to be. An excellent method will be to cross reference it with your magical diary! There is an important symbolic significance that such a book has. This significance reaches well beyond just writing things down for you to remember. The book of ceremonials is set up to be your own sacred book. It is written by yourself for your own use and only for your own use. As you are proceeding in writing into this book you add to its spiritual powers continuously. You do so regardless whether you are consciously aware of this process or not at the time of writing. Time only will teach you the tremendous value of this book. It is like a magical utensil. Repeated use of any magical utensil ties up energies in it that later will simply be present whenever the utensil is present. With such a utensil \"switched on,\" you can use your conscious focus on other things that are not as much routine as are the energies of a utensil. To set up your book of ceremonials, be sure to buy a notebook or diary that looks very nice. If you have some leanings toward arts and crafts you may do your own book binding. At first you copy Odin's Rune song into this book. This song contains the symbolic representation of your initiation into the runes. Later you will copy into this book the magical poem of eighteen stanzas. This magical poem contains the key triggers to the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes. You will receive this poem with your next lesson. For now, you may copy into the book the first Rune Song, the Song of FA. As you keep receiving the other letters of instructions, you keep copying all other rune Songs into the book of ceremonials As you proceed in your Runic practice you will write into this book the various rituals, ceremonials, and other Runic practices. Is it especially important that you write down these rituals that you develop on your own. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"lesson02 True, to copy and write by hand takes some of your time, but this time is a rather small investment compared to the benefits that you will get from such a practice. While writing, you are writing in symbolic and evocative language, the meaning of which will communicate itself to you with Runic practice. As you advance you will penetrate the depths of this symbolic language and you will gain a deeper understanding of the hidden meanings of the poems and songs. How to copy in your book of ceremonials To gain a maximum benefit from your writing, you should do it in the environment that is optimal for this process. It should be quiet and free from outside interference. There is more going on than just writing when you do this work! Therefore you should make sure that you will not be disturbed in this important work. You should arrange your whole set-up for writing in a ceremonial like manner. Before you begin to write, bring yourself into a state of meditation. You establish your inner Rune realm and then you focus your whole undivided attention on the process of writing. Imagine and feel energy flow through your hand and pen into each letter and word that you write on the paper. See and feel every word that you write fill up with spiritual energy and radiating with Light and Life energies. If you cannot yet focus your undivided attention to your writing you need not be too concerned. Time and practice will be your best teachers. Take your time to become accustomed to this new way of writing! If you proceed as I have instructed you, your book of ceremonials will be a powerful talisman that connects you with the Runic realms of creation whenever you use it for a Runic ceremony. There is a great significance in your writing your own book of ceremonials: a significance that goes much beyond that which you may comprehend at present. The Diary The diary is another essential tool for the Rune student. In this diary you write all important steps in your development, your insights that you consider being significant, visions, actions, and results of your Runic practices. Whenever you decide to perform a Runic ceremony, you make your notes about it before you begin with it. You write down a step by step description of how you proceed, the timing, purposes, and means employed in the ceremony or operation. After you completed the operation you write down your impressions that you had during the work and any other comments that may cross your mind at that time. At a later time you should then add your commentaries about the success of the operation and possible changes in procedure when you do similar work in the future. It is good to cross reference these entries with the entries in your book of ceremonials. You can easily understand that the magical diary is one of the most useful tools in your practice and that it helps you improve upon your techniques and knowledge. You may also use your diary to write down the many insights that you have during your training and practice, visions, significant dreams, and anything else that you consider relating to your spiritual advancement. At a later date this diary will be a most useful documentation that will tell you how you used to think at an earlier time of your spiritual unfolding. It will tell you about your path in retrospect. When you read it at a 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"lesson02 later date you can determine how to proceed more effectively and how to avoid future errors. Neither the diary nor the book of ceremonials should ever fall in the wrong hands. The reasons for this are obvious. Rune masters of the past went to the extent of using secret codes for their diaries. Persons who accidentally read such a diary usually interpret such codes as \"formulas to conjure spirits.\" Access Keywords, Meanings, and Correlations of Runes (continued) The Rune THORN THORN is the Rune of activity and of the active mind. In this capacity, the Rune THORN is symbolized as the Rune of the master of the swords. It is a Rune of active exchange and one of the Runes that represent Thor's Hammer. THORN is a Rune of polarities. While FA is the spark of creation, UR the chaos at the threshold of creation, THORN symbolizes the emerging of opposite polarities from the zero point energy of chaos. From the realm of opposite polarities THORN reaches much deeper into multiple polarities of an infinite order. As Rune of opposing polarities THORN represents life and death, hot and cold, light and darkness, etc. It is a Rune of opposites that actually are polarities of one and the same process. Therefore THORN is also a rune of eternal return and as such contains in itself the mystery of the thorn that awakens from sleep. The THORN that touches the zero energy of chaos brings forth continuous creation. THORN is the Rune of the dowsing rod, of lightning and thunder, of magnetic transfer and of metal telepathy. THORN awakens in us the will to act and to creatively act upon our universe. It helps us get in touch with the continuous change of day and night, waning and waxing, life and death. THORN protects us against attacks, especially magical attacks. The mantra of THORN strengthens the aura.

It is a Rune of Odic energy that frees us from the bondage of the perceived material world. Being the Rune of conscious manifestation it can give us strong magical powers. OS teaches us to recognize the laws that govern the magical universe and the magical hyper spaces. You can use OS to enhance the growth of your spiritual powers. You may use OS also to draw powerful astral and mental energies.

Remember well the meanings of the Runes, because in these written meanings are contained the keys to their action. You can tune into Runic experience at any level of your practice. No matter how advanced you are, there will always be something beyond. Most students who are meant to experience the full extent of Runes in this lifetime will have almost immediate experiences when they begin with their first steps in the Rune realms. Healing with the Rune UR In this lesson you will gain a first experience of transfer of Runic energies for healing purposes. By now you are at the threshold of being capable to bring creative energies to manifest in the material universe of space-time. A first exercise is to bring about healing effects manifest in other persons. It does not matter at all if such a person believes in a healing of this kind or not. Here I am going to introduce you to the visualization method of healing with Runes. Such a healing is particularly effective with the Rune UR. You can perform such a healing at a distance at any place. All you need is a quiet place. As you progress in your Runic practice you will need not even a quiet place for such a purpose. 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"lesson02 You proceed as follows: 1. Establish your inner Rune realm. By now you should be capable to do this with relative ease. 2. In the inner Rune realm focus your awareness on the Rune UR. 3. Draw UR into the center of your Rune realm where you are: You are all UR! 4. Connect further with the Rune UR and trigger its creative energies by singing the stanza of UR: \"A second I know, quite useful for those who practice the healing hand ...\" You may do the singing aloud or in your mind. 5. Draw the Runic energies of UR into your body. 6. Visualize the person whom you are targeting with healing energies. 7. Imagine the Runic energies flow to the target person, uninhibited by any limitations of space. 8. After several minutes of practice you return from your inner Rune realm back to your material universe. Additional hints: 1. You gain access to your inner Rune realm by means of meditation practices as I have described in the first lesson. A great help is a guided meditation tape that helps you establish your inner Rune realm and enter it with ease. 2. It is a good help for your practice to visualize UR (or any other Rune) outside yourself, in front of yourself, shining brightly and having life in it (pulsating!). You need not see the Rune with your physical eye. Your imagination is mainly an awareness of the Rune being in front of you. At a later point of your practice you will begin to see the Rune with your inner eye. Notice that you are connected with the Rune that you are imagining. This way you open up a channel of energy between yourself and the Rune. 3. Once you established a Rune outside yourself you may proceed to draw Runic energies into your own body. Be aware that there is an infinite supply of Runic energy available. It is a good practice to draw the Runic energies into your body while you are inhaling. 4. Visualize the target person that you intend to heal. Imagine a channel of energy that reaches from you to that person. If the person is in the same room as you are you simply imagine a channel between yourself and that person through which you send Runic energies. If the target person is at a distant place you establish a bridge between you and that person. 5. While you exhale, you project the Runic energy from your body through the channel that you have established into the target person. 6. Repeat the process of drawing energy into yourself and projecting it to the target person as long as you feel is beneficial: perhaps between five and fifteen minutes. With every draw and push you retain a bit of 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"lesson02 Runic energy for yourself. When you practice the transfer in this way you actually gain strength yourself while you are sending healing energies others. 7. When you decide to end the operation, simply stop the imagination processes of drawing and sending Runic energies. Mentally you should thank the Rune for its energy and send it back to the realms of creation. Ground any surplus energies through your feet into the ground. This way you prevent from being overcharged with Runic energy. Next you sever your conscious connection with the reams of the Rune by becoming once again consciously aware of the things that are around you: Listen to the sounds of your environment, direct your awareness to the things that you see around yourself, notice the smells, feelings, etc., and smoothly lead yourself back into your everyday perceptions and experiences. Exercises for the second lesson: 1. Set up your book of ceremonials and copy Odin's Rune Song into it. 2. Set up your diary. Describe your inner Rune realm as a first entry into your diary. 3. Copy the song of UR into your book of ceremonials. 4. Practice UR following the instructions in the first lesson. 5. Practice the hand and body positions of UR while singing the mantra of UR. 6. Send your progress report to your Rune Master and request your next lesson. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. Preview for the next lesson: Thorn 1. About Rune Yoga. 2.

Lesson 3 Home 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"lesson03 Letter of Instructions # 3 The Rune THORN by Karl Hans Welz Welcome to THORN, the third Rune. With FA and UR, you learned already some basics of Runic practice. You learned how to draw Runic energies, how to experience Runes, and how to use Runes for healing. THORN is the Rune that helps you project Runic energies -- and any other energies. With this lesson you will learn a powerful discipline that helps you in your path to becoming a Rune Master. This is a discipline that will cause your body, mind, and emotional body to be a cleaner more powerful tool. It is Rune Yoga. Rune Yoga is a large body of knowledge. It is the subject of another course of nine lessons that you may order from the KOR. In this lesson, you will learn some of its basic principles of this powerful discipline. To get beyond the basic knowledge that you learn in this lesson, you should order the Rune Yoga correspondence course. After passing the correspondence course of Rune Yoga, you may ask for certification to teach Rune Yoga and in classes and workshops. As you know, Runes open many potentials for you. Much of this knowledge is not known to you yet and I have to ask you for some patience. With time everything will fall in place. As you continue with your practice and studies many before unknown mysteries will open up to you almost effortlessly. This is so because of the creative power of the subject of your studies: the Runes! You can apply the appropriate Runic practice to overcome any challenge in life that you may feel the need to cope with. Runic practice is even more powerful when you practice it with a group. In fact, there is not only a difference in degree of intensity, but an essential difference in Runic practice, depending on your practice. You will have entirely different experiences with a group, with a single partner, or by yourself. Therefore I suggest that you experience Runes on all levels possible. Your success of Runic practice will increase when you prepare yourself to be a clear and powerful channel for the energies that you draw from the workshop of creation. One of the practices of preparing yourself to be a powerful channel is Rune Yoga. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"lesson03 Much of what we know about Runes has been handed down to us from an ancient and mysterious past. Some of it came from the very dawn of mankind. Some Rune masters such as Karl Spiesberger claim that there was an Atlantean Yoga that was at the root of all existing Yoga systems. I do not agree with this claim. However I think that it is not antiquity that makes Rune Yoga such an exceptional tool, but the effects that it has on you when you practice it. Rune Yoga encompasses the whole of the person. Its practice will be beneficial to your body, mind, emotions, and will power. Rune Yoga is a unique combination of body and hand position, controlled breathing techniques, Rune Mantras, focus on specific shapes (Rune symbols), meditative awareness of realms within, and ceremonial settings. Rune Yoga is an excellent way to achieve general balance. It is a gateway to deep mystical experiences. It helps opening your chakras. Like Hatha yoga, it can help you to a slender, healthy body. A very important aspect of Rune Yoga is that it can intensify your power to project healing energies and Light. Rune Yoga gives you the power to project energies at any target, no matter how distant this target may be. Rune Yoga is easier to practice than the Indian Hatha Yoga system. This is so, because Rune Yoga uses the principle of SHAPE INDUCED ENERGIES in a multi-sensual and multi-focused experience. Such experience that involves as many of your sensory organs as possible and several mental foci at the same time is very effective. The body positions of Rune Yoga are much easier to practice than the rather difficult contortions of the Indian Hatha Yoga. Rune Yoga is rooted in the principle of shape induced energies, or shape vibrations. It is easier to practice than the Eastern Yoga systems, especially Hatha Yoga. This is so because the body positions of the eastern Hatha Yoga are rather complicated. We generate (or attract) shape induced energies (shape vibrations) whenever we use a specific shape to connect with an energy of a higher order such as (in the case of Runes) energies of creation. The word, shape, can mean any one of many different things. A graphical outline is a shape. A mantra is a shape that involves sound frequency and time. Your hands and your body as a whole are ideal tools to posture shapes. The shape of the body or the hand posture then can be a trigger of the cosmic energies that the it represents. For you to understand what I mean here, I remind you of a pyramid. It is relatively irrelevant of what material the pyramid is made, for it to develop pyramid energies. On the other hand, the shape of the pyramid is very important. Therefore, we say that pyramid energy is a shape induced energy, or a shape vibration. Posing a Rune easily develops the Runic energy pertaining to this shape. So does the \"mudra,\" or hand position of the Rune. Both of these you have practiced in the previous lessons. Because of the conductivity of the human body, SHAPE-posing with your hand or body, sometimes with both, is one of the most effective methods available to generate powerful fields of Runic energy. Shapes, or body postures of the Hatha Yoga are beneficial for the health of the body and mind. The practitioner of Rune Yoga is AWARE of the energies that come from the realms of creation when he/she draws them with a body or hand posture. You can feel these energies easily. Consequently you are capable to progress more swiftly, smoothly, and, especially, with much more ease when practicing Rune Yoga. The Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes allow you an intimate connection with the realms of creation facilitates your development of mental, psychic, and spiritual powers. Consequently, if you study Rune Yoga, you can develop yourself to be a powerful receiver and transmitter of cosmic vibrations. The Rune THORN is your first step towards getting in touch with deeper and more elaborate methods of 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"lesson03 sending and receiving energy. You will then experience the energies in much more complex and powerful forms than possible with many other methods with which you are familiar. Practicing Runes, you will gradually become acquainted with methods of sending and receiving which transcend space-time as we generally understand it. The practice of Rune Yoga includes all steps of yoga, or discipline, which are part of most spiritual developments. 1. Purification and control of your body with diet. 2. Special methods of purification with Runes (see lesson 7 -- HAGAL) and with Rune positions that are beneficial for the well being of your body. 3. Purification and cleansing of your aura and chakras. For this type of purification you can use special Runic methods that you will learn in lesson 9 -- IS. 4. Control of breath, especially with Runic visualizations. 5. Special practices with Runic sounds. 6. Control of emotions, achieved with Runic practice, especially the practice of IS. 7. Ridding yourself of obstructive distraction. 8. Opening up to higher psychic powers. 9. Recognizing your True Ego, which is unencumbered by everyday distraction, and getting in touch with your Higher Self in the practice of Runic Empowerment as experienced in your initiations. 10. Expansion of your consciousness into the realms of the Cosmic-Divine and active participation in the process of Creation-Eternal. Only the power of truth, the power of true thought, the power of responsible directed will, the power of well-managed emotions, will lead us to the original realms of creation-eternal. Practice of Rune Yoga will help you achieve this goal. Once you master the steps of Rune Yoga, you will be capable of consciously tapping in the centers of power that lie beyond the confines of our physical worlds, and you will be capable of triggering forces of manifestation that you are drawing from the realms of eternal creation. Most students are familiar with the positions of the Eastern Yoga. Those positions may appear grotesque to some people. They also demand a good degree of flexibility of the body. If practiced correctly, exercises of the Eastern Yoga (Hatha Yoga) lead to excellent health, since they supply all organs well with blood, develop a strong nervous system, supply the cells of the body, cause harmonious glandular functions, and well-balanced hormonal distribution. Runic positions are not as difficult as the asanas of the Hindu Yoga. They are much easier to practice for many people. They lead to similar results for the body. When you pose a Rune you are not so much concerned with squeezing some parts of your body, while other parts are expanded. Rune positions act mainly as triggers for shape vibrations. The specific shape symbol of the Rune, positioned with your body (or hand) draws energy from the realms of Creation. Therefore, besides a beneficial impact upon the health and well feeling of your body, there will also be an impact upon the more subtle parts of your body 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"lesson03 in a true holistic experience. Practice of Rune positions teaches you control of your body, emotions, mind, and will powers. ASCETICISM From the most remote times of human history, many religions and esoteric training systems have regarded asceticism as a very important tool for spiritual progress. In fact, some systems put so much emphasis upon asceticism that they ended up causing irreversible damage to body and soul by gross exaggeration and wild excesses in \"mortification of the flesh.\" Some organizations use milder forms of asceticism to cause an imbalance in perception and thinking in potential members. As a consequence they become more susceptible to mind control techniques. Watch for coolaid and cookies in those weekend- intensives!!! Vegetarianism is not implicitly important for the mental progress or for individual development, unless it is used as a remedy to clean the body from slags. Some magical and religious systems require a temporary abstinence from meat or animal food for specific ceremonials as a way of preparation, and then only for a specified period of time. The same holds for sexual abstinence. The idea that, by eating the meat of an animal, the \"impurities\" of the animal would be conveyed to the person who eats it, is nonsense and originates in ignoring the perfect and primal laws. Such thinking is very kin to the thinking of the cannibal who tries to acquire the courage of a slain warrior by eating his flesh. The Rune Master does not pay attention to such misconceptions. In the interest of your development, you should be moderate in eating and drinking and observe a reasonable mode of life. It is impossible to present precise rules or prescription, since the way of life is individual. No doubt, for many persons vegetarianism is an excellent tool, especially when they live in a country where, on the one hand, there is much overemphasizing of and misinformation about meat eating, and profit oriented reckless pollution of meat on the other. You must know what best agrees and disagrees with you, and you must then act responsible. It is a sacred duty to keep the balance everywhere. Health is your responsibility. Should your body be out of shape, consult a good nutritionist. Needless to say, non-foods and drugs are a no-no. During your training, you will exercise three kinds of discipline: 1. Intellectual or mental discipline 2. Psychic or astral discipline 3. Physical or material discipline The first kind has to do with the discipline of thoughts, the second is engaged in ennobling the soul through control of passions and instincts, and the third kind is concerned with harmonizing the body through a moderate and natural way of life. CONTROL OF BREATH Runic practice is unthinkable without proper control of your breath. In fact, every Runic practice contains three elements: a body or hand position (or both), a breathing practice (which includes sometime singing or chanting of the Rune), and a single or multiple focus: the point from where you draw or where you project Runic energies. 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"lesson03 If Runic practice provided us alone with benefits of proper breathing, this alone would be reason enough to practice Runes daily. You need to be aware of the importance of breathing, proper breathing, which is beyond just material-physical benefits. Few human beings are breathing correctly. Consequently their body cells do not receive sufficient oxygen. Waste materials are not sufficiently eliminated and will accumulate consequently. Diseases of all kinds, emotional disturbance, tiredness, and many more imbalances are the consequence. Besides supplying the body with oxygen and eliminating waste materials, correct breathing also massages your inner organs continuously. When you inhale, then the diaphragm gently presses upon the intestines, stomach, spleen, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. When you exhale, then the diaphragm gently massage your heart and lungs. In continuous change, one group of organs is gently massaged while the other group is relaxed and has space to expand. Breathing also supplies you with life energies. The Yogi calls this energy \"Prana.\" Others call it Chi energy. In the West, we are talking about Odic energy, or Orgone energy. This energy can be measured with scientific instruments. More important so, this energy can be directed consciously to various parts of your body, and transferred to other people. You can actually generate Odic practices. Odic energy can be dynamized by attaching specific Runic energies that will benefit on the material, etheric, and other planes. To facilitate your work with prana, you should acquire a Welz Chi Generator. With this generator, you can also power up the energy of any Rune of your choosing. Write the manufacturer, HSCTI (P.O.

OS has a special meaning in this path. It is the Rune that teaches you to accept the fruits of your efforts. It provides you with the spirit -- or attitude -- to accept these fruits without setting up new limitations for yourself. Your Runeing of the Song of OS has a powerful consequence: It will provide you with the understanding of acceptance-in-freedom. OS will increase your psychic powers. It contains powerful spiritual energies that lead to freedom. To those who need it, OS can give the power of convincing speech. OS readies you to accept the highest astral and mental energies. These are the energies that belong to the astral and mental planes. While FA is a Rune of sending, OS is a Rune of receiving. Better yet: FA is a Rune of the first spark, or of the fire that kindles an event, while OS provides you with the results. In many ceremonials, OS is used to receive and to accept energies. In the practice of transferring healing energies and light, OS is one of the most powerful tools. It is to be practiced by persons who receive the healing energies. In a group situation each person may signify one specific Runic vibration. A group practice of Runes produces more powerful results: your practice will be more effective and the energies that you will harness will be more abundant. RUNIC HAND POSITIONS On many statues of Hinduism, Buddhism, and many other religions, you may have noticed hand- and finger-positions. The same positions you will notice with some Asiatic dances, especially those of the island of Bali. These positions will trigger something inside us ... almost without exception. Yet, most people are not aware of just WHAT hand positions will trigger. Western culture has never provided us with the appropriate experience. Seeing the positions of the hands always reminds us of ceremonials. We get hints about deep mysteries being tapped. Hand positions of this kind hardly ever fail of causing us to be aware 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"lesson04 of realms much beyond of the realms that appear tangible to us. This is so especially when the hand position appears in combination with a body position that expresses the same thing as the hand position. Persons who are aware of psychic energies may notice shifts of realms of levels of reality when of finger- or hand-positions are practiced. We know that the Hindu Yogis are using finger- and hand-positions for specific spiritual and psychic purposes. The yogi calls these positions \"Mudras.\" Rune hand positions serve in the main to attract energies from the realms of creation. Like body-positions, hand-positions are triggers of \"shape vibrations\" or shape induced energies. We remind the reader that pyramid-energy is such an energy that is induced by a shape. Shape induced energies can be verified various means, including technological devices. In fact, the symbol of the HAGAL Rune produces effects similar to the effects of pyramids. Shape induced energies may be triggered by many symbols, not just pyramids or Runes. Persons who mastered the realms of shape induced energies are capable of charging these energies with their specific requests, ideas, or wishes. Whenever you shape the symbol of a Rune with your hand or with both of your hands you draw the energies of the Rune into your body. From there you may direct it anywhere. One of the effects of Runic hand-positions, or mudras, is that they align the polarity of your body molecules with the Runic energy that you attract with your hand position. Here, I understand the term \"molecule\" from a hyperphysical point of view! I give you a hint about Runic methods that are rooted in the relation of the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes with the periodic system of elements. As a result of continuous practice of Runic hand positions you become increasingly aware of the more subtle components of your body. The same practice will also bring awareness of the more subtle parts of your universe. You are then capable of restructuring, realigning, and balancing those parts. Again, be aware that the full benefit of practicing Rune mudras does not come over night, nor will a weekend workshop provide you with \"Instant Runes!\" When you practice Rune mudras, especially in a group situation of mutual exchange, you will effect a general healing cleansing of your body and of your Aura; and you will charge and awaken your chakras, or spiritual centers. In a group situation, this general healing and cleansing will affect the group as a whole. Runic hand positions have a very special role in the balancing, awakening and developing of chakras, especially in group practices! More details of these very powerful practices are in the Rune Yoga/Rune Healing course. Gradually, you will be introduced to knowledge of the benefits of Rune Mudras. A very effective way of practicing Rune Mudras is to mentally chant the mantra of the Rune while inhaling. While exhaling you feel then the Rune energy stream through your hand (the hand that poses the mudra) into your body. CONTROL OF BREATH Runic practice is unthinkable without proper control of your breath. In fact, every Rune practice contains at least three elements: A body-or-hand-position, or both, a breathing practice, which sometimes includes singing of the Rune mantra, or of a Rune song, and a single or multiple focus to dynamize and direct the Runic energies. All three elements will shift during the course of the practice. When, while working the lesson of UR, you have practiced healing with Runes, you already employed these three principles. You need to be aware that breathing is very important. However, few human beings are breathing correctly. Consequently, their body cells do not receive sufficient oxygen and waste materials are not sufficiently eliminated. Diseases of all kinds, emotional disturbances, tiredness, and depression, are but a few of the many consequences of improper breathing. Breathing also supplies us with life energy. In the East, this energy is called \"prana.\" In the West, scientists gave it many names: Animal Magnetism (Mesmer), Orgone energy (Reich), or Odic energy (von Reichenbach), Solar Ether (Korschelt) to name but a few. Orgone can be measured with scientific 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"lesson04 instruments, accumulated with orgone accumulators (the first ones wer built by Franz Anton Mesmer some 200 years ago) and generated with the Welz Chi Generators. Still more important is the fact that Odic energy can be directed consciously. Furthermore, you can attach energies of a higher order to this energy, thus modulating it for specific effects. Then you can dynamize it and send it anywhere you decide to produce results on the material, etheric, astral, and higher planes. You need to be aware that with normal -- non conscious -- breathing the body is supplied with only as much Odic energy as is necessary for its normal functioning. The situation is quite different when you practice conscious breathing! Conscious breathing can supply you with huge quantities of Odic energies is a relatively brief time. If you visualize or imagine a thought, an idea, or a Rune into the air to be inhaled, it will connect with the Odic energy, pass through the lungs into the blood vessels, and charge not only the body with raw life force, but it will stream through the astral matrix into the astral body, from there through the reflective mental matrix into the spiritual body. This process, understood correctly, explains the secret of breathing from an esoteric point of view. Many theologies use techniques of conscious breathing for instructive purposes, as does the Hindu Yoga system, without completely being aware of the processes involved. In fact, there are people who have suffered severe damages to their health as a consequence of some of the extreme breathing exercises demanded by some of the Yoga schools. In most of these deplorable cases, the inexperienced reader has been persuaded to do the breathing practices, because they were promising an acquiring of psychic and occult powers. If you want so, you will reach those goals much more easily sooner with the help of the Runes. As you have been reading the preceding, you have become aware that it is not the quantity of the inhaled air which matters, but it is the quality. Quality is enhanced by the Runes with which you are impregnating the Odic component of the airflow into your body. Therefore it is not necessary, in many cases not even advisable, to pump the lungs full with a lot of air and putting needless strain on them. Do your breathing exercises slowly and calmly, without haste, tension or strain. As an exercise, sit down in a comfortable position, relax the whole body, and inhale slowly through the nose. As you inhale, you imagine that, with the inhaled air, the Odic energy is very powerful, and imagine that this Odic energy is filled with the energy of the Rune UR. You know that UR causes your body to feel healthy and calm. Imagine UR being around you. Whenever you inhale, you draw UR into your body, and whenever you exhale, you distribute the healing energies of UR into all parts of your body. You feel the healing energies in every part of your body. THE SYMBOLISM OF THE RUNES At this point, it is useful to go into more detail about symbols in general, and the symbolism of Runes in particular. There are may researchers who claim that a symbol becomes an active symbol (having effect on the material conscious planes), once it is made to be a true symbol (according to their model), namely by charging it with energy. Others claim that every symbol emanates some radiation by itself, because of its shape proper. They say that charging is not necessary at all. As an example they mention the symbolic shape of the pyramid, where pyramid energy can be measured, but also other shapes such as the pentagram, hexagram, yin-yang, etc. seem to corroborate their claims. At this point, the first group will say that charging indeed has been done, subconsciously, by expecting the symbol to act in a specific way. Or they use the label \"archetype.\" At best this latter label is a construct that is used to fit anything. So we find various polarizations of beliefs concerning symbols. One group which claims that the symbols 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"lesson04 themselves contain the energy, another group of people who believe that it is necessary that a symbol is charged, a third group which puts the charging back some millennia, a fourth that only the belief of the person who works with the symbol is energizing it. The arguments go on and on, and the truth may be somewhere in between. It seems that we need an all-encompassing theory of symbols, which includes all the know facts, rather than fruitless discussions of what is \"true\" or \"false\" according to metaphysical mental acrobatics. People who discuss metaphysics of symbolisms have yet to reach the scientific insights that allowed quantum mechanics in physics emerge, which is a theory encompassing various facts that are apparently at odds with each other. The type of \"truth\" which scientifically untrained and ignorant metaphysicists (the bulk of them, I am sorry to need to point out) try to achieve belongs to the purely verbal levels. Verbal levels of this kind are based on a language that developed thousands of years ago and which necessarily reflects the primitive metaphysics of these times. Using such a pre-conceived mapping, these metaphysicists fall victim to the structures inherent in language, they squeeze the facts that they examine into it and consequently they reach theories as inadequate as the primitive metaphysics that shaped the linguistic structure to begin with. Consequently, there is no progress, just endless philosophizing. While arguing in terms of language- based \"truth,\" this class of metaphysicists becomes totally oblivious of the factual basis of their theories, and that raw experience and usefulness of a method are criteria much more valid than volumes of fruitless logical and philosophical treatises, discussions, and speculations. Seen from this point of view, it is of little concern to us whether or not symbols are inherently charged, invisibly and inaudibly pink, and what not. For our convenience, we talk about shape vibrations that can be found in Rune symbols and positions, as well as in the sounds of Rune mantras. The effects of such structural links can be demonstrated with relative ease (see the course \"Magic of the Future\"). What is of interest here is that we have several useful methods of working with Rune symbols, that we consequently can observe effects on the material and conscious planes, and that we are able to formulate natural laws, or convenient mappings which explain the interaction of Runes with the material planes, and that we can apply the laws thus found for devising new methods, or technologies, of applying Runes for many purposes. With Runes, we have not only a set of symbols, but we have a symbolism. Before I am going to talk more about this symbolism, let me first explain what I mean when I use the word \"symbol.\" Symbols have several characteristics: 1. They have an outline, or some kind of SHAPE. This shape may be graphic, such as any symbol that we can draw on paper, or it may be in space, such as a pyramid. The shape may also be of an other access system of our perception, such as an auditive shape. An example for such a shape may be a mantra. Some symbols, the Runes included, have several shape representations: outlines, mantras, etc. 2. A characteristic of symbols is what we call their symbolic aspect: some meanings of the symbol may be derived from its shape, or outline, as it stands within the context of the symbolism. This symbolic meaning does not necessarily emanate any energy. In other words, the symbolic aspect of the symbol does not necessarily need to be active. 3. Next, we have an evocative aspect of a symbol. This is an aspect that is not necessarily found in the outline itself, but the symbol serves as a trigger that gives access to the specific evocative meaning. The evocative dimension of a symbol may change throughout history, and it may be important to consider the dimension of time (the timeframe) when the metaphysicist accedes the evocative dimensions of the symbol. One method of coming in contact with the evocative dimensions of a symbol is to meditate over the symbol. This evocative dimension of symbols has been used to attach specific initiatoric wisdom into symbolisms and symbols, as a means of preserving this knowledge for the future. 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"lesson04 4. The energetic aspects of a symbol may be derived from its symbolic and/or evocative meaning. The symbol serves as a trigger that gives access to its energies. 5. A symbol may be part of a symbolism. When I say symbolism, then I mean an ORDERED ARRANGEMENT of symbols, in which the order of the symbols and their position to each other is of key importance. The symbolism, containing all symbols, is a symbol in itself. It is a symbol of a higher order than the symbols that are its constituting parts. In a symbolism, each symbol that is part of it relates to all other symbols because of its position within the symbolism. In a symbolism which we call linear, such as an alphabet, each symbol is numbered. The number given to the symbol determines its position within the linear symbolism. This number does not describe the symbol in a \"numerological sense,\" nor does such a number add its own, non-numerological or other, meaning to the meaning of the symbol. Other symbolisms may be laid out in a plane, such as the zodiac (which is numbered too). In such a symbolism, the relations are more complex than in a simple linear symbolism. The realm of a symbolism encompasses more than the sum total of its individual symbols. On the other hand, an arbitrary array of symbols has hardly any dimension of symbolism beyond the mere sum total of its individual symbols. In an array of symbols, the position of each symbol to every other is of no importance. Symbols in general represent a form of mapping of the realms for which they are relevant. The symbolism of chemistry, for example, is base on the periodic system of the elements. It is valid for the realm of chemical reactions of matter. The fact that we do no know of anything material which we could not express with chemical formulas does not mean the symbolism of chemistry constitutes some kind of all- encompassing world-mapping, or world-formula, which may be used to describe everything, from life functions to nuclear explosions. Chemical formulas can describe some aspects of all those phenomena. Similarly, we may state that we do not know of anything that does not have aspects that we can describe with the symbolisms of physics, astrology, mathematics, the cabalistic symbolism, etc. Yet, none of these symbolisms should be viewed as a world formula. They may be useful mappings, no more. But there are people out there who confuse that which they can describe with the mapping itself, hence the \"world- formula syndrome\" found in many metaphysical circles, among astrologer, cabalists, and in circles of many \"skeptics\" whose background is a mere pop science (this horrible distortion of useful science that takes on many of the negative aspects of a fanatic religious creed). Esoteric, metaphysical, or hyperphysical, symbolisms have an essential distinction from purely materialistic symbolisms, such as physics, chemistry, or materialistic biology. These symbolisms are standing for energies of a higher order. This means that they generally contain a system of gradual initiation which reaches into realms of thought and into planes that are beyond the purely material planes, while in a purely material-planes based symbolism the dimensions of finer densities may be omitted. The 18 Sacred Futhork Runes have all characteristics of a hyperphysical symbolism. They are hyperphysical, because Runes reach into dimensions well beyond the confines of the limited space time continuum which physics, chemistry, etc. describe. The 18 Sacred Futhork Runes are a symbolism and not a mere array of Runes. They are a linear symbolism, or a numbered alphabet, where the position of each Rune is important. They are also a symbolism of higher order, which may be arranged in the zodiac, or in a plane, with its own, specific, interrelations from Rune to Rune. Positions within the symbolism allows to derive meanings of the Runes valid for the specific context of the symbolism. The mantras of the Runes constitute another, sound based, symbolism. Runes and their symbolisms represent mappings of the Realms of Creation, which give us useful methods of interacting with those realms and relating them to the world in which we live. 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"lesson04 The 18 Futhork Runes represent a path of initiation (which is beautifully shown in Odin's Rune Song), provided the student elevated him/herself to the level where the deep symbolic meanings of the various Rune documents can be understood. Odin's Song shows you how to experience Rune initiations, while the \"magical poem\" provides you with a system of triggers that gives you access to the transcendental energies of the Runes. To experience the depths of Odin's Rune Song is an important step toward gaining full access to the Rune Realms of Creation. After you experienced Odin's Rune Song and after you experienced the 18 stanzas of the magical poem, you will no longer have any doubt as to whether you should work with the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes, or whether you should dabble in some incoherent arrays of \"Runes,” “Anglo- Saxon\" (there are some 35-plus arrays of them), \"elder,\" and what not. The symbolism of the Runes is multi-ordinal and stratified knowledge. First, you will get acquainted with each individual Rune, and you will experience the realm of this Rune. With your Runic empowerments, first as a Knight, and then as a Rune Master, everything will fall in place, and the symbolism of the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes will communicate itself to you. Form then on, you Runic work will be backed by your connection with the realm of the symbolism as a whole. It is also backed by the group energy of the Knights of Runes and Rune Masters, past, present, and future. After the first initiation, you may again go the path of each individual Rune, now with increased contact with the realm of the symbolism, to a more advance level, up to your next initiation. Initiations are optimally experience as part of a special ceremonial, performed by a group. EXERCISES 1. Copy the Song of OS is your book of ceremonials (if time allows). 2. Murmur the Song of OS and practice OS. 3. Practice the hand positions of FA, UR, THORN, and OS, and combine those hand positions with the breathing technique described under \"control of breath.\" While inhaling, mentally sing the mantra of the Rune. Feel the flow of Rune energies, and experience the Runes within yourself. 4. Send your progress report to your Rune Master and write about your experiences.

Lesson 5 Home 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"lesson05 Letter of Instructions # 5 The Rune RIT by Karl Hans Welz With RIT, the fifth Rune of the Sacred Futhork, I am going to introduce you to the basics of ritual and ceremonial in general and of Runic ceremonies in particular. Furthermore, I will briefly describe the various ceremonial utensils that you can use for Runic practice. You may purchase the utensils and other materials from the K.O.R. The Rune RIT can awaken and develop in you the power of skillful visualization. Visualization is a powerful aid to perform Runic operations as well as any other magical practice. You find an in-depth description of the CFP (Common Functioning Principle) of all magic, including Rune magic, in the course “Magic of the Future.” When studying this course you will understand much better the function of ceremonial utensils as structural links. CANDLES There is hardly any ceremonial where Light would not play an important role. Light is neutral. Depending on the action to be performed it assumes some color. Since Light is so important, most ceremonials contain and include something that symbolizes Light. Candles are the preferred utensil to symbolize Light. Of course, there are deeper symbolic meanings connected with candles than that of giving Light. As you become familiar with various methods involving candles you will understand better the many symbolic meanings that candles connect with. Consequently you will be capable to touch upon more dimensions that involve the symbolism of the candles This will greatly increase the effectiveness of your magical operations. Candles, as we know, are made of various materials, mostly paraffin, more seldom true bees' wax. Candles may be scented and colored, tailored to special lengths and shapes, etc. As you progress, you will learn to include colors and shapes of candles into the overall symbolism of your ceremonial. 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"lesson05 The significance of candles reaches into may levels. Since candles are mostly thought to symbolize Light, they are the only source of light in many ceremonials. The specific color of the candle will symbolize the sphere(s) with which the operator wants to be in contact during the ceremonial. The number of candles used has another symbolic meaning. Operators who practice evocations and who work with the higher order energies that are part of planetary spheres match the number of candles with the number of the planet: three candles for evocations of Saturn or of beings of the sphere of Saturn, four candles for Jupiter, five for Mars, six for the Sun, seven for Venus, eight for Mercury, and nine for the Moon. Candles are an excellent tool to help the powers of visualization and imagination. The flame of a candle is an ideal focus. In some magical practices you may internalize this focus. When you practice with Runes you may use any number of candles that correspond to the specific higher order energies used in your operation. You may use one candle that has the Rune engraved which you practice. Instead of engraving the Rune, you may put the candle (candleholder) on a piece of cardboard or wood that has the Rune drawn on it. This Rune may be charged before use. Excellent is a set of 18 candle holders, each one with another Rune drawn or engraved on it.\\ Many ceremonials require the use of more than one candle. It is good practice to use one candle for each Rune that you use in the ceremonial. You may use three “neutral” candles, i.e., candles that have no Rune inscribed. These three candles would then symbolize the three groups of Futhork Runes. You may use five candles if you want to take advantage of the dynamics of the pentagram. You may use six candles which represent the Hexagram, or six candles with a seventh candle in the center, if you want to symbolize the Hexagram with the three inscribed diameters, mother of Runes. You may use nine candles which, in Runic ceremonial, represent the Rune IS, the true ego, bridge to your Higher Self. You may go all the way and use eighteen candles in your ceremonial, one for each Rune. When you use eighteen candles, I recommend that you inscribe one Rune on each candle. You arrange those eighteen candles the same way you arrange the 18 Rune Staves. You may put one candle to the side of each Rune stave. Candles of made bees wax have some advantages over candles made of paraffin: There is more \"life\" in them. The color of the candles is to match the purpose of your operation. White candles are good for every operation. In the case of bees wax candles, the natural wax coloris equally universal. One candle alone or two candles serve as an excellent focus. Such a focus is very helpful for your concentration and visualization powers. Two techniques are useful, depending on the number of candles. While looking at the flame of one candle see visions in the halo around the candle. When you use two candles, look in the space between the flames of both candles. The best distance is between six and eight inches apart. In either case you will better be able \"to grasp the arrow with the look of your eyes.\" As a practice, you may use only ONE candle for you Runeing, where it can serve as an added focus. Engrave the Rune in the candle. Practice the following way: 1. Put your candle on the altar, or table. 2. Establish your outer and inner Rune Realms. For murmuring practice alone, the inner Rune Realm is sufficient. 3. Light the candle and say: \"Forces of the Light Eternal in the universe, Penetrate darkness! Sacred Flame, shine! Bring Light to the night! All around darkness All around night I amidst the Light 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"lesson05 Darkness is merged With the Light! Original fire of FA Burning since the beginning Of times Light Force of AR Born in the Sun At the beginning of the worlds Give Light to the seeker! 4. Be aware that there is an OUTER Rune Realm around you of which the candle is a focal point for the Rune which you practice. 5. Practice your Runeing. 6. Look into the flame of the candle, imagine that the Rune is in the halo that surrounds the flame. Then close your eyes and remain a few minutes in silent meditation. Wait for insights, feelings, visions, thoughts, etc. to emerge. As a variation, you may look into the flame of the candle. Soon, a halo of ca. 6 to 8 inches, sometimes more, will appear around the candle. Wait for visions that may appear around the candle. Wait for visions that may appear in the halo. This second method requires some practice. It is useful for developing clairvoyance. It also improves your dream life. 7. When you decide to end the practice, say: \"Powers of . . . (name of Rune) Thank you for your energy Flow back to the Realms of Creation!\" 8. Imagine, or visualize, the Rune energies grounding, flowing into the ground, as water flows down a drain, or seeps into sandy soil. 9. Extinguish the flame of the candle. 10. Write your experiences in your diary. Now, you have at your disposition a basic outline for many Rune rituals, useful for many purposes. For practice of healing with the Runes UR and THORN use two candles, on with UR engraved, and one with THORN engraved. Proceed as shown above, but do healing under point 5 (instead of Runeing). OTHER UTENSILS Candles are not the only utensil. There can be many more ceremonial items on an altar. In fact, when setting up and arranging ceremonial items, it is a good thing to follow your intuition concerning the symbolism involved while following some general guidelines. In the following, I am going to introduce you to some of the most important, or most common, features of a ceremonial. The ceremonial set up is very helpful, because it enables you to set up a plenum of energies within which Runic work is made easier. One of the most important sources of \"raw energy\" needed for the practice of energy transfer and triggering is emotional, or astral energy. This type energy is in general produced within the context of a good ceremonial setting. A group of people who take part in the ceremonial can be extremely helpful. It is very important here that all participants want to contribute to the ceremonial. Likewise it is important that all participants receive some benefit from the ceremonial. A powerful alternative is to produce this emotional, or etheric, energy technically. The device for this purpose is the orgone generator, or Welz Chi generator. Ask the KOR for further information on this exciting machine. 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"lesson05 As I pointed out before, ceremonial utensils are focal points for the more subtle, higher order energy components that are essential for the success of the ceremonial. When I speak of the \"symbolic meaning\" of a utensil, then I refer to the structures of the Higher Order Energy components that are connected with this specific utensil. The utensil establishes then a structural link (\"psychic link\") to the repective energy field. Another, very important, characteristic of utensils is the following. As the utensil is used on a regular basis, the transcendental energies (HOEC's or Higher Order Energy Complexes) attached to it increase (and modify to some degree) more and more. Very soon the utensil is capable of \"functioning by itself\" without the practitioner needing to be consciously aware of any of the utensil's inherent characteristics and functions. Thus, a dagger is no longer just a knife, but it is the instrument that gives the practitioner dominion over astral -- emotional -- energy complexes. The magician speaks of a thought form that is attached to the ceremonial utensil. The basic arrangement of all utensils will set your \"machinery\" or \"central switch board\" ready to function smoothly: it allows you to define energies of a higher order, to make them work for you, and to send them wherever you want to send them. An important factor, then, is to follow all instructions given in order to have the Runic energies and HOEC's (which will be created and/or modified by Runic energies) perform as you intended and to cause the desired results on whatever level(s) you projected them. In the following, I discuss some of the most important utensils that you can use in the ceremonial set up of Runic practice. 1. THE TEMPLE The temple is your \"workshop,\" or, better yet, your place from which you are triggering the HOEC's for specific purposes such as healing. It is the space within which you arrange all your tools, or machinery. It is your specific outer realm (outer Rune Realm) from which you reach every point of your universe. You may, in fact, see the temple as a symbol of your universe. As with any workplace, cleanliness enhances proper functioning. Since you are working with HOEC's, or \"psychic energies,\" be aware that the temple needs also to be free from any kind of psychic debris or psychic pollution, otherwise the results of your practices may be negatively influenced. Many banishing rituals are designed to clean the temple from undesirable energies, so that psychic energies can be projected without undesirable interference. In Runic practice, you may use the Runes AR, IS and MAN to cleanse. Some students may not have a special room or space available for their temple. Although a specific assigned space for a temple has great advantages, it is not absolutely essential. Of course, you can practice Runes anywhere. You establish your temple by determining what space will serve as your temple, and by cleansing it from any undesirable psychic energy with AR, MAN, and IS every time before you begin to practice. You may define the boarder of the temple mentally or with a wand or dagger. Depending on the situation, you may chant mentally (yes, you CAN perform a fully valid ceremonial in the midst of a crowd, without anybody noticing what you are doing), or you may chant aloud while in the body positions of IS (grounding position), MAN, and AR. 2. THE PROTECTIVE CIRCLE The protective circle within your temple is a space within which you are working, unencumbered by any energy that may be attracted by your work. The circle makes sure that no energy will be present except those which you desire to be present. It is a barrier against negative energies and other energies that may 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"lesson05 interfere with those HOEC's (Higher Order Energy Complexes) which you are going to trigger. This way, the circle serves not only as your personal protection from hostile HOEC's, but it also insures a clean functioning of your Rune Yoga practice. An ideal circle is formed by laying out all 18 Runes, which will then be in tune with your Inner Rune Realm. Have the sixteen Runes arranged on the periphery of your circle, starting with FA in the North, counter clockwise to YR, which will then be on the right side of FA. Have EH and GIBOR inside the circle, since those Runes symbolize the marriage of opposites and the universe of the symbolism. EH West and Gibor East just inside the outer circle of Runes. The diameter of the circle is dependent on the amount of people participating in the ceremonial, and of course, considerations of space. 3. THE ALTAR The altar is the actual workplace, or your control panel. In more advanced practice, it can also serve as a point of manifestation for specific HOEC's, in which case you have to observe specific measures of protection or insulating methods. Being your control panel, it will contain utensils that connect with the specific structures of the universe and HOEC's with which you are going to work in your ceremonial. Therefore, the arrangement of utensils on the altar and the symbols used will vary according to the purpose(s) of your ceremonial. You will, however, notice some CFP (common functioning principle) on all arrangements of your altar. The size of the altar depends on the number of people attending, size of your temple, amount of utensils, etc. For most individual purposes and for small groups, an altar the size of 24 x 30 inches will be adequate. 4. RUNE STAVES Since you will use Runic energies, a set of triggers to those energies on top of the altar is of utmost importance. These Rune staves will be arranged in a circle, as shown in the diagram. More than the staves around yourself and the altar, the staves on the altar are triggers that connect with your Inner Rune Realm and the Runic Realms of Creation. Practical experience has established that a circle of Crystal Rune Staves by itself can give a clean temple and the protective circle as outlined above. However, I still recommend that you practice the banishing and cleansing as well as the establishing of the protective circle wherever possible. You may use Runes made of cardboard and charged accordingly, or you may use Runes made of wood. Crystal Runes are excellent and superior even to the traditional wooden Runes for several reasons. One of the reasons is that the crystalline structure of quartz represents HAGAL, and the \"mother\" of the Runic symbolism (the hexagon with the three inscribed diameters). Look at an ideally formed Quartz crystal from above and you see the HAGAL Rune inside a hexagon. Another reason for the awesome strength of crystal Runes lies in the fact that crystal energies can be modified and directed: modified by Runic energies that are very kin to the crystalline energies, and directed by means of gridding. All practitioners who used crystal Runes (and compared to wood) noticed the difference in power immediately! Available from the KOR: a. A deck of eighteen Rune cards that may also be used for divination purposes. These cards have ONLY the Rune on it. \"Neat\" pictures of Elves, Gods, Goddesses, and other artistic clutter would water down the energy of the Runes. 2. Wooden Rune Staves, and 3. Crystal Rune Staves. 5. THE MAGICAL WAND While the candles connect with the will and the worlds of emanation, the wand is the tool that expresses 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"lesson05 the will of the practitioner. It is your tool to dominate the HOEC's that have characteristics belonging to the mental spheres. The symbolic meanings of the power rod or wand will be the more familiar to you the more you practice with Runes and other ceremonials. 6. THE INCENSE BURNER The incense burner connects you with the mental worlds, with HOEC's that are part of the mental spheres, and with the air element in general. 7. THE DAGGER The dagger (or sword) represents your mind which controls the emotions and HOEC's that belong to the astral spheres. Again, while the incense tunes into mental worlds, the dagger uses mental energies. 8. THE POWER ROD The Power rod is an ideal combination of wand and dagger. It is very suited for work with Runes, because of the use of a quartz crystal as a tip of the power rod. Very powerful is a tube that acts as an orgone accumulator. You may either put alternating layers of organic and metallic materials around it or, simpler and more powerful, paint it with orgonite, which is a mixture of metal powder and epoxy or any other type glue. 9. THE CUP WITH WATER (OR WINE) The cup connects with the astral worlds and with the emotions. It provides the energy necessary to bring results in your ceremonies. It symbolizes the emotional power of the practitioner. Drinking the water or wine aligns the astral-emotional energies with the goal of the ceremonial. Water accumulates Odic energies (life energies) which are \"programmed\" with the goals of the healing ceremonial. In fact, any liquid that you like to drink is good! 10. THE HAMMER OF THOR The Hammer of Thor represents your consciousness that can connect with any point in space-time and then return back \"to yourself.\" In other words, the Hammer of Thor can be projected to any interval in the space-time continuum of your universe. It can be developed into being your specific tool to break the self- imposed limitations of space-time. It symbolizes conscious action which is charged and energized by the other elements (wand, sword, and cup). Once energized, the Hammer of Thor will perform for you. Again, with repeated practice you will learn more and more about this most powerful tool of Runic ceremonials. Thor's Hammer is perhaps the best symbol of your conscious projection. It collects within itself the three elements of the will, mental, and astral-emotional spheres. Once you have charge Thor's Hammer, you have aligned all elements toward your specific purpose: your will, mind, emotions, and consciousness. All you need to do now, is to throw Thor's Hammer (its higher plane components) toward your goal, which is embedded in an interval of your conscious space-time continuum. Thor's Hammer is your tool on the material planes that reaches beyond the confines of space and time. It is your instrument of power, your connection to your universe, your power of projecting into your universe whatever energy you charge the hammer. Thor's Hammer, therefore, is the most powerful Runic talisman, symbolizing the element earth on your altar. You need to learn to use Thor's Hammer properly. Tune into the Nordic mythology of the god Thor and his hammer, and you will gain additional information about this powerful tool of Rune Practice. The material hammer of Thor remains on your altar, of course, but its spiritual parts, or components, you project them to the desired goal. You do this directing with the powers of your 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"lesson05 imagination. Be aware that the more you practice using Thor's Hammer the more skillful you will become in its use. In fact, RUNE YOGA TEACHES YOU THE SKILL OF PROJECTING AND USING THE HAMMER OF THOR! Ideally, your Hammer of Thor should be a true talisman, which you can wear as a pendant. You may use a piece of paper with Thor's Hammer drawn on it. PREPARATION OF YOUR UTENSILS Repeated use of a ceremonial utensil connects you with specific energies without you needing to tie up your own forces that then can be better used toward the purpose of your practice. In this respect, a utensil takes on the function of a GENERATOR OF ENERGIES that belong to the higher levels. Utensils seen under this aspect, you must realize the importance of proper preparation of your utensils, including yourself, since you will be an integral part of the ceremonial machinery that you are about to set up. Ideally, all utensils should be bought new, and only you should use your utensils. Never lend your utensils to anybody else. An exception may be candles and incense, as well as some of the accessories of an altar, such as the incense burner, which may be used by anybody who attends the ceremonial. A set of Rune Staves and Hammer of THOR may be shared, and belongs to the altar of a Rune Castle, or lodge. This set may be used by everybody who is member or guest of the group. Your personal Rune Staves, on the other hand, should NEVER be used by anybody else than yourself. This counts as well for group ceremonials. The same holds with your Thor's Hammer, Rune dagger, and other utensils that you own. Now, to the preparation and blessing of your utensils. The simplest preparation of a utensil is by charging it with your energies. Bring yourself in a meditative state -- preferably establish your Rune Realms. Then put the utensil in front of yourself and hold your hands above it. While inhaling, visualize your body drawing energy from the universe. When exhaling, you visualize that energy stream through your hands into the utensil. The charging, of course, has many variations. As you progress with your knowledge of Rune Yoga, your insights will increase, and so will your means available. Prepare all your utensils by charging them. With all utensils prepared, you are well prepared for any ceremony with Runes. THE MAGICAL POEM F A I know the Songs that no wise woman knows And none of the children of men.

Obviously the nature of the eighteen stanzas is such that the understanding student will notice immediately that books could be written about the hidden, or esoteric, meaning of those stanzas. To achieve a maximum understanding of the 18 Rune Stanzas, you need to open up to their symbolic contents, plus their evocative meanings. This opening up will happen with practice of the Runes.

Knighting Ceremony Lesson 6 Home 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"lesson06 Letter of Instructions # 6 The Rune KA by Karl Hans Welz KA is the Rune of capability. It stands at the end of the first part of the Sacred Futhork. This first part served you as an introduction to Runes. In this part you became familiar with Rune energies. Now, you are ready for more advanced techniques of Runic practice. YOU ARE READY TO BE KNIGHTED INTO THE SACRED ORDER OF THE KNIGHTS OF RUNES. With your consistent practice, you opened your channel to the Time-less Brotherhood of Rune Masters which will soon accept you as a Rune Master. From now on, you can consider yourself a full member of the Order, because you have familiarized yourself sufficiently with Runes to be capable of full participation. You are ready for the knighting ceremony, because the Rune KA makes you capable and because you became aware of your limitless potentials. Now you know that you will be a Rune Master soon. In retrospect, you may take stock of what you have achieved with your Rune practice up to now. You have learned to help; first of all to help yourself, then you got the idea of how to help others with the powerful tools of the workshop of creation, the Runes. You learned to draw energies from the Moon, from the planets, and from the Sun. Next, you learned of the healing powers of the Rune UR, how to draw those energies and how to develop your own, inner, Rune Realm. Next, you learned to project Rune energies, to accept, to visualize. Now, with KA, you are entrusted powerful keys of Runic wisdom. As you progress with your practice, KA holds many more keys in store for you, depending on the level that you reach. It is always up to you, the Knight and later Rune Master, to prove yourself worthy for the next keys. Power means responsibility, as much as growth and advance mean often anxiety and may bring conflict. This holds true for Runes as well as for studies in any other discipline. With the next Rune, HAGAL, you will be ready to expand into the Crystal of the worlds, or the Universe of the Runes. KA gives you the keys to this journey. As a Knight, you enter a new phase of your practice. KA gives you capability of Rune Ceremonial (RIT) and ritual. 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"lesson06 KA brings you new responsibilities, new powers, and new potentials. Your capability is result of your practices where you learned to relax, to control your breath, to visualize, to establish your Rune Realms, and to establish vibratory fields that assist you in directing thought forms and to change karmic trends. YOUR POSITION AS A KNIGHT Runes are mystical experience. They provide you with power. Power is only of real value when it is shared and used wisely. Power increases when it is shared and when it is part of a group practice. Group practice increases the power of the group as a whole, as well as it increases the power of each contributing individual. The true benefit and secret of correctly performed group ceremonials lies in the fact that the resulting power is more than the mere sum total of the powers that contribute to the ceremonial. Runes are tools from the workshop of creation. The access to these tools and their use was long lost to all larger religious systems which are still in existence as well as to most of the smaller religions. In some religious systems, especially more recent ones, you may find some hinting at energies from the realms of creation. The creative energies are often misinterpreted as the universal light. In a very few systems, you find then some practical application of energies from the workshop of creation and very rudimentary attempts of harnessing their powers. Yet, nowhere can be found a true method which not only provides the student with a sound understanding, but also with effective and safe methods of using these powerful energies. Rune Masters and Knights have access to the tools of Creation. While there has been affiliation between religions and Runes in the past, Rune Masters decided against any affiliation in the present. Such affiliation would prefer one religious system and consequently exclude all others. Religious leaders are encouraged to use and include Runes. Runes are life affirmative, light affirmative, and a practical application of the tools of creation. They are participation in the very act of creation-eternal. Rune Masters know about the many facets of the spectrum of the Universal Light. These facets are the Runes. You are at the threshold of being entrusted with more effective use of these energies. You learned to use Runes for your own benefit and for the benefit of those close to you. Your power is growing immeasurably with your practice of Runes. The potential of this power brings you also responsibility that reaches far beyond justifiable self love and love for those who are close to you. The more access you have to the very special knowledge of the tools of creation, the Runes, the more responsibility as a Knight, later Rune Master, will increase. You will be called upon -- from within -- to use the tools of creation, the Runes, for the benefit of the planet on which you are living. This planet needs good spiritual energy more than anything else. As a Rune Master you will be capable of DOING that of which followers of the many denominations are only dreaming. There are not yet enough Rune Masters on this planet to effect the necessary change. Many people still have to be chosen to join the spiritual hierarchy of this planet, so that the goal of a better planet to live on can be achieved. Once there are sufficient living people who are knowledgeable in working with the tools of creation, once those people join forces, then it will be possible to perform that which all major religious denomination are hoping for: to change the karma of this planet, to turn the wheel of history in the right direction; away from a path of destruction, death, disease, hate, and war, into a path of life, love, and light. Runes are the tools of the workshop of creation. As a Knight of Runes, you have access to these tools. From now on out, you are no longer experimenting with Runes, but you put them to practice in your life. You practice Runes responsibly as you get increasingly acquainted with them. You are ready to use Runes responsibly in order to make our planet a worthwhile place to live in. To be more effective in drawing and projecting Rune energies, group practice is essential. As a Knight of 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"lesson06 Runes, you are entitled to enlarge your power base by forming a circle of people practicing Runes which meets regularly for study and practice: a CASTLE. With this larger power base your progress will be much swifter and the results of all Runic practice will be stronger. Later, when other persons in your castle will be knighted, this power base still increases, Rune energies may be mutually exchanged, and consequently all members will increase their strength and capabilities. With this larger power base, your contribution to world peace, world harmony, and redemption of this planet can be helped significantly, which will be beneficial to your own karma as well as to the karma of those Knights who are part of the castle. There is much more to the idea of the CASTLE than can be said here, much more that any materialistic oriented science could attempt to tell, and much more than mere symbolism of ancient chivalry could reveal. You will find out as you progress on your direct path to Oneness with your Higher Self. The active castle is the smallest unit of the Order, it is its smallest group. As such, it is of great importance. Let's explain here what we mean when we say \"active castle\": The castle of a Knight or Rune Master are all persons who were sponsored by this Knight or Rune Master. This relationship which was established by sponsoring remains, even when at a later date the sponsored persons will have his or her own castle, or join another castle for practice, and ascends in the hierarchy of the Order. The active castle, on the other hand, are all persons who actively participate in work, studies, and ceremonials of a castle. Should the original founder(s) of a castle be no longer active in this castle, then the next person in line will head the castle. However, the original founder will still enjoy spiritual benefits of the power base of his or her castle. There are more subtle, more esoteric, aspects to the castle, which you will learn later. For the moment, it is important that you are entitled to start your castle as soon as you are a Knight. Now, you are ready to practice and lead group ceremonials to harness Rune energies for whatever purpose you determine. TO ESTABLISH YOUR CASTLE You proceed as follows: 1. Find three or more students of Runes whom you sponsor, and/or one or two other Knights. 2. Ask for an application form, and apply for a castle. Your Rune Master will help you in establishing your castle. He or she will also help you in questions of ceremonial, Rune practice, energy exchange, etc. 3. Your castle is entitled to a specific coat of arms which is composed of heraldic symbols which traditionally represent Runes. 4. From now on out, you will receive all necessary information for group ceremonials, utensils, etc., in a special series of letter of instruction for castles. At first, your castle will be a circle of joint study and transfer of Rune energies. It will have regular meeting, once a month. With Rune energies, the castle will support members in their everyday situations as well as in their overall advancement. Later, with sufficient membership, your castle will expand in a lodge, which will increase the power base of every member. PREPARATION FOR YOUR KNIGHTING CEREMONY First, practice with the Rune KA: 1. Copy the Song of KA in your book of ceremonials, if your time permits. 2. Copy the Knighting ceremony in your book of ceremonials. 3. Practice Runeing (murmuring) of the Song of KA, with a ceremonial setting as outline in the letter of instructions of RIT. 4. Practice body positions and hand positions of KA. 5. Visualize your inner Rune realm, having all Runes present. 6. Get all necessary materials for your ceremonial. 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"lesson06 7. If you are member of a castle, or lodge, make arrangements with them for your initiation. Otherwise, you will perform the ceremony by yourself. For the Knighting ceremony, you need: 1. 6 candles, in each of which you engrave one Rune starting from FA to KA. 2. An incense burner. 3. Frankincense, or special incense for Runic ceremonials. 4. A white tablecloth. 5. Your book of ceremonials. 6. A cup of water, and a dish with bread. Before you begin the ceremony, you bless the water as follows: Enter your inner Rune Realm, meditate, project the energy of the Rune KA into the water. Project for about one minute. Prepare the bread in the same manner. Now, you are ready for the ceremony. First, arrange your table of this altar, or if you have already a special altar for Rune work, use it. Set incense, candles, bread, and wine on the table. Have the candles arranged in the shape of a hexagon. Be sure you are in a quiet, meditative mood. Also, make sure not to be interrupted during the ceremony. If you write your Rune Master beforehand, he or she may tune into your ceremony. Visualize yourself clean from all distractions. A bath before the ceremony may help as a symbolic cleansing away of everything which does not belong into the ceremony. KNIGHTING CEREMONY INITIAL COMMITMENT: \"May the power of the Runes Lead me to a better understanding Of the universe and myself. May the power of the Runes Further my path to Oneness With my Self and the Universe. I thank the singer of the Edda For preserving the heritage of Atlantis. I stride the direct path to Oneness With my creative force. I tear down the fences that separate individuals, Groups and Nations. Fences that have been erected by blindness. I am a wanderer to higher realms. United with all people of good will and Power I am working to achieve A unified homeland of mankind On the throne of which Divine Spirit, Divine Wisdom, And Divine Love are ruling. 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"lesson06 Position of MAN, sing MAN three times. Now, light the candles, then say: \"Power of the Light Eternal in the Universe Penetrate darkness. Sacred flame, shine! Bring Light into darkness. Around darkness, around night, Darkness has merged with the Light. Original fire of FA, Burning since the beginning of times; Light force of AR, Born of the Sun At the beginning of the worlds, Give Light to the seeker!\" Now, light the incense. Then drink the wine. Next, establish your inner Rune Realm, meditate on KA within your inner Rune Realm, at least two minutes. Then, eat the bread and repeat the meditation. Speak the following commitment ONLY if you sincerely intend to stride the path of Oneness with the Divine: \"I am aware that I am accepted as a member of the Order of the Knights of Runes. This is my first initiation in the hierarchy of this planet. This initiation gives me powers, capabilities, rights, and responsibilities. I am aware of my responsibilities as a Knight of Runes. As a Knight, I am in touch with my Higher Self, I am in touch with the Divine. My Higher Self and my Divine nature become more and more manifest in me. More and more I become a clear channel of the Divine. I am aware that, as a Knight of Runes, I am striding the direct path to my Higher Self, which is the path to the Holy Grail, the path to Christ within, the path to Christ consciousness, the path to myself as a King Magician. As a Knight, I am in service of the King Magician which I am. I am aware of the old symbolism of the King: The King is the symbol representing my Higher Self, the King is the symbol of my Divinity. I am aware of the Divine spark within myself this everlasting flame shines on my path to my goal of being ONE with the Divine. This initiation to Knighthood means responsibility for me. Responsibility to myself, responsibility to my fellow human beings whom I help against their foes of destiny and whom I help find their path to the Divine. Responsibility to the planet on which I am living. Responsibility to the Time-less, Age-less, Brotherhood of Rune Masters, or which I am part soon. 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"lesson06 I am committed to learn to serve, and to help.\" Now, you meditate for about five minutes, being in touch with your inner Rune Realm. Then proceed: \"May the power of the Runes Be the source of my reshaping Of my destiny responsibly. May the power of the Runes Lead me on my direct path To my Higher Self. May the power of the Runes Help me work actively For a better destiny of my planet. May the power of the Runes Help me contribute to establishing A prosperous New Age on this planet Where there is one unified Homeland of mankind On the throne of which Divine Spirit, Divine Wisdom, And Divine Love are ruling. \"From now on out, I am capable of using the tools of the workshop of creation wisely and responsibly. \"As a Knight, I am aware that the work of Knights and Rune Masters will be decisive for the destiny of our planet. As a Knight, I am spreading the opportunity to participate in the very act of creation to all people who are ready, willing, and worthy. As a Knight, I am committed to help those who are in need of help, spiritually and materially. As a Knight, I am a leader to those who strive toward achieving spiritual Knighthood and mastery of the Runes. I am a good example and pillar of support for those persons.\" Now, extinguish the candles and incense. Then proceed: \"Thank you, exalted forces, for accepting me as a Knight.\" Be aware that the Runic energies flow back to their origin. This is the end of your initiation ceremonial. WELCOME TO YOU AS A NEW KNIGHT! PREVIEW FOR THE NEXT LESSON: HAGAL 1. HAGAL, the World Crystal. 2. Method to transfer Runic energies. 3. Ceremonial to draw and project Runic energies 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"lesson06 Letter of Instructions # 7 The Rune HAGAL by Karl Hans Welz This letter of instructions is very important for you. It is the first lesson of your knighthood. In this lesson, you will learn to draw energies from the world crystal. The symbolism of the Rune HAGAL points to the world crystal. HAG-ALL means to take care of the universe. You will also learn to project these energies for healing, purification, chakra development, chakra balancing, and for other purposes. HAGAL, the Rune of the world crystal, stands at the beginning of the second group of Runes of the Sacred Futhork. Now, after you have been knighted, you are ready to reach into the realms of creation-eternal, to draw Runic energies, and to project these energies to any point in your universe, or into the universe of another person, for creative change. In the preceding lessons -- especially UR and THORN -- you have learned to work in this direction. Now you have the opportunity to increase the effectiveness of this work and to deepen your understanding of the processes involved. Now is the time for you to work with one partner or with a small group. As a Knight, you may start your own castle and practice group work with Runes there. HAGAL symbolizes that which comes from the universe. It is the symbol of creative force that takes care of the workings of the universe in the process of Creation-Eternal. It is HAGAL -- which is often referred to as “Mother of the Runes” -- that allows you to have access to the creative forces of the universe, to which you are reaching out in your quest for reaching your Higher Self and to becoming ONE with the Divine. With HAGAL you have the key of being the Architect of the worlds. Symbolizing the world crystal, (look at the shape of the Rune!) HAGAL is the focal point upon which all Runes converge and from which you can reach all other Runes. In this respect the Rune GIBOR is kin to HAGAL! Continuous creation means continuous change. HAGAL is the Rune of the world. Around the center of HAGAL the worlds are whirling. HAGAL symbolizes one aspect of the chakra of the crown of the head as well as it symbolizes one aspect of the root chakra. There are two more Runes that have a similar symbolic connection with both chakras: FA, the Rune of original fire (kundalini) and BAR. Bar is the Rune of birth. Likewise it is the Rune of being born again in the spirit. BAR symbolizes the mystical death that comes after the decision to sacrifice the old ego to become one with the Divine. FA is male-fiery while BAR is 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"lesson06 female-watery. HAGAL unifies the two, center and periphery, into an ever-present balance of phenomena that emanate from the world-crystal. Understanding of this relation between these three Runes is one of the keys to your chakras. HAGAL is the Rune of the tree of life. It symbolizes the union of several couples of Runes. First EH and NOD, then YR and MAN, and finally AR-KA (the couple that generates EH) with NOD. HAGAL is the Rune that can bring you in contact with your spiritual guide, with guidance, or with the Higher Self. It symbolizes the union of fire with water, of spirit with matter, of creation with chaos, of tree with root. HAGAL is always ready to reach out for a still higher union: the unification with your Higher Self and awareness, full awareness, and presence, conscious presence, of the Divine spark within you. HAGAL is the Rune of atonement of karmic debts. This is so, because there are no longer karmic restrictions once unification, or spirit-matter, are conscious. With HAGAL you reach out by means of union. Experience HAGAL in a ceremonial setting -- as described in the lesson RIT -- and you will gain significant insights that will lead you to a very important breakthrough. METHODS OF TRANSFER OF RUNIC ENERGIES One of the most important tasks of the Knight of Runes is to help those in need. This help is important, for it helps overcome old karma. Furthermore it creates new and positive karma for you. When there is talk about projecting energies, many people think immediately about sending Light, more precisely, white light. When you transfer energy you may project white light of you may project colors. Colored light is specific energy for specific purposes. White light is indiscriminate, because it contains all the colors of the spectrum. Sending Rune energies compares to sending light. With runes you send dynamized energies from the realm of creation. Runes, specific Runes, are capable of making your projection of energy specific to the help that is needed. Such projection is not indiscriminate as would be the case with white Light. Runes dynamize the energies that you project and they give them their specific colors and hues of colors. The Runic system may be compared to a multi dimensional spectrum of energies. This spectrum is of a much greater complexity than a simple rainbow. The Runic symbolism of the Futhork teaches us the many \"colors\" of this energetic spectrum. The beneficial effects of transfer of energy for help, healing, purification, etc., go beyond mere tangible effects. Using Runes to help others, to heal, to purify, to draw good circumstances, to help spiritual insights and to help develop chakras, is a form of gratitude to your Creator within. It is a sacred task to use the talents with which your Creator entrusted you. To project Runes to help others, therefore, is an expression of your service to the Divine. It is your opportunity to erase negative karma. HAGAL connects and combines the inner and outer Rune realms with the realms of Creation. Meditate on the shape of HAGAL, and soon you will be aware of its function. In every practice of transfer of Runic energies (or Light dynamized by Runes), you should be aware of these very important dimensions of HAGAL. The KNIGHT, or leader of the castle, will practice transfer of Runes on other persons. Members of the Order may practice before they are knighted, but we suggest that they be under guidance of a Knight, or Rune Master, when they do so. BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE PROCEDURE OF TRANSFER OF RUNE ENERGIES 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"lesson06 We strongly suggest that you follow the exact procedure of transfer of Rune energies. Later, as a Rune Master, you may create your own ways and ceremonials to project Runes. The following methods have been proven to be very effective. Even complete newcomers are capable of FEELING Runic energies most of the time, provided they truly open up to them. You will FEEL the flow of Runic streams. Later, you will be capable of actually seeing those energies, provided you follow our instructions. Consequently your control of those energies will increase dramatically as will your skill of transferring them and of selecting the correct Runes for every specific purpose. YOU PROCEED AS FOLLOWS: 1. Set up your outer Rune realm. In case the outer Rune realm is a permanent set up, which is the case in a lodge facility, then each person who enters the circle of the outer Rune realm has to tune into this Rune realm. Each person has to become aware of this realm and to acknowledge it. 2. Be aware of your inner Rune realm and get in touch with it. To develop this inner Rune realm is not an absolute necessity for the person who is going to receive Runic energies. For the Knight who projects energy, establishing the inner Rune Realm is a must. 3. The person(s) who project Runic energies develop a magical force field and strengthen their capability to draw and to project Runes. 4. The person(s) who are going to accept Runic energies get themselves ready to accept Runes and their benefits. 5. After this preparation, Runes are projected and received. 6. Optional: Projection on chakras, kidney (for purification), magnetic treatment to cleanse and purify the aura, chakras, and physical body. 7. End of the ceremony, thanking and grounding of surplus energies. SETTING UP OF THE OUTER RUNE REALM You need: 18 Rune Staves (you may improvise with 18 cardboard tablets that have the Runes drawn on them), table with white tablecloth, or altar. Candles, Incense burner, Frankincense or specially blended Runic incense. Candles should be of green color, when for healing. Pure bees wax candles are better. Rune Staves: You may order a set that is ready-made, or, as an improvisation, you may draw the 18 Runes on 18 tablets of cardboard. Crystal Rune Staves are of great power! Now you determine the area where you intend to perform the transfer of Runic energies (or any other Runic work). The number of people participating and considerations of comfort will determine how large the circle will be within which everybody will be: the person(s) who transfer and the person(s) who receive Runic energies. You do not need to trace a circle on the floor as in other magical practices. In Runic work the circle is be determined by the Runes that you lay on the floor, in circular arrangement, as shown in the lesson of RIT. 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"lesson06 The only furniture allowed inside the circle is the little altar (a small card table may suffice), chairs, pillows, blankets, or whatever else is desirable for the comfort of the participants. Needless to say, cigarette smoke does not belong in the room where transfer of Runic energies is performed, especially when for healing! Once you determined the outline of the circle, you begin to lay out the Runes. Start at the left side of the North point of the circle (Ideally North) with FA, go around counterclockwise -- like the zodiac -- and end with GIBOR. As an option, the altar may be placed at the center of the circle. With the 18 Runes around you, you have set up an energy field with all its component shades and colors. From this field you can draw at will. It is the Runic symbolism at work. Now, each Rune that you draw contains this symbolism and it will work in tune with the Runic symbolism as a whole. This circle is your temple. Next, you charge the Runes of the circle. With this action, you raise the power potential of the circle. You can charge the Runes in several ways. You will learn these methods in the course of your studies. For now, we teach you one method. You proceed as follows: With a magical wand, your index finger, or a power rod, you point at FA. Sing the mantra of the Rune, then mentally project energy into the Rune Stave of FA, then sing the stanza of FA of the magical poem: \"I know the songs . . . \" Proceed like this with every Rune, until you reach YR, the EH and GIBOR. Charging the outer Rune Realm can be done by more than one person. In this case, the celebrating Knight would point at the Rune and charge it, another Knight will recite the appropriate stanza, while all others chant the mantra of the Rune. Now, the outer Rune realm is established. Every person who enters the circle at a later time, has to tune into this outer Rune Realm. This is done by either looking at each Rune, or by pointing at it, chanting mentally the mantra of the Rune. Beginners may be assisted by Knights or Rune Masters. ESTABLISHING OF THE INNER RUNE REALM After entering the circle and tuning into the outer Rune Realm, each participant has to meditatively establish the inner Rune Realm. The only exceptions are persons who are not members, but who enter to receive Runic energy. However, it would be good if a Knight or Rune Master helps these persons establish the inner Rune Realm regardless, so the energies projected at them will be strongly enhanced due to the fact that they have established a strong base for reception of those energies. You tune best into the inner Rune Realm by a silent meditation and proceeding as taught in the first lessons. If a group as a whole enters the circle at the same time, then a tape may be played which helps enter the inner Rune realm, or a Knight of Rune Master may guide the meditation. 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"lesson06 You should be aware that your inner Rune Realm is in constant contact with the outer Rune Realm and that both are linked to the Rune Realms of Creation. Imagine and visualize this with all your strength. This way you create a powerful flow of Runic energies. DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDIVIDUAL FORCE FIELD FOR DRAWING AND PROJECTING OF RUNIC ENERGIES This following practice needs only be performed by persons who are going to project Runic energies. 1. Body Position of MAN Look at the stave of MAN Visualize MAN Chant the mantra of MAN Prayer: Power of MAN, release in me the power of the Divine. 2.

HOW TO PROJECT AND RECEIVE RUNIC ENERGIES 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"lesson06 Odic energy, which is projected, is a wholeness of spiritual, astral, mental, and etheric Light. This Light is dynamized by one or more Runes, which then give it its specific color, shade, and effect. In general, you draw the Odic energy with one hand, and then you project it to the other person with your other hand. When drawing, see or feel with your strongest possible imagination the energy of a specific Rune, or Odic energy, flow into your body through the hand that poses the rune. In general you draw while inhaling. While inhaling and drawing, mentally chant the Rune Mantra. When projecting, see or feel with your strongest possible imagination the Rune energy flow through the projecting hand in the other person, or into the part of the body the other person where you intend to direct Odic energy. I recommend to begin your projecting with the Rune Fa into the center between the eyebrows of the receiving person (the third eye, or ajna chakra). Besides strengthening on all levels, this method also helps develop the third eye and it leads to development of psychic abilities that are connected with the awakening of the chakras. This method also helps purify chakras and to balance them, especially the chakras in which much of our karma is stored. Later, you may project other Runes through the Ajna chakra. You proceed as follows: First chant the Rune aloud. Repeat three times. Then point your right (or left) hand toward the eye chakra. Either project with your palm or, better yet, with the fingers in focus. In either case, keep a distance of three to six inches from the point to which you project. The other hand should be lifted up. It acts as an antenna that draws the Runic energies. The hand position of the Rune will enhance the draw. Feel the energies flow through this hand and arm into your body, from there into your other arm, hand, and then into the other person. While inhaling, mentally chant the mantra of the Rune and imagine the energies flow into your body. While exhaling, imagine those energies flow through your other hand into the third eye of your partner. Proceed this way approximately for five minutes. Then proceed in the same manner pointing at the heart chakra, then Solar plexus, three to five minutes each. If you intend to heal, then draw and project the Rune UR (hand position) upon whatever part of the body which you want to benefit from Runic energies. Especially the kidneys are very receptive to this special kind of purification. In a later lesson, you will learn to use Runes for purification and strengthening of the aura. This special process requires the knowledge of using magnetic passes.

Where hate should arise from man against man This I settle fast! The symbolism of the stanza of NOD points out that NOD is the Rune of karma, of karmic need and of karmic debt. With NOD you will be capable of recognizing karma by viewing it from the creative realms. It is evident that such a perspective leads to the skill to overcome karma. The power of NOD is a very profound one. It takes a high stage of your personal evolution to have to power of overcoming karma and of setting actually determining your karma. In the mythology of the Atlantean North NOD is one of the Runes of the Norns. The Norns are goddesses who are spinning the threads of destiny, or karma. To be capable of working with NOD means to be capable of evoking the Norns. To be capable of such an operation, the Rune Master needs to have gained a thorough understanding of what karma means. Otherwise such an evocation will invariably cause problems. The Rune Master will gain this understanding by acquiring an appropriate mapping, or insight, of TIME in which DESTINY is EMBEDDED. NOD allows you to gain an understanding of destiny and of time. Therefore NOD helps you to gain access to the realms of the Norns. To try to gain access to the realms of the Norns before you have gained the necessary understanding of NOD may bring some serious problems. In most cases, though, the Norns will smilingly forgive the person who tries to approach them unprepared. However, if such approach is attempted with negative, or unethical, attitude, then whatever the operator projects will inevitable backlash against him or her in karmic determinism and structuring. At your present state of evolution, NOD allows you to recognize the reasons for your present karma. Consequently you will be able to work with it and eventually overcome it. NOD will give you memories of events that shaped your karma, present and past lives. It will give you insights in events that were significant for the shaping of your present karma. NOD also can help you overcome bad karma and change your destiny for the better. At this stage, NOD is likely to help you accept your present karma and to make the best of it. Read and murmur the Song of NOD to understand. In addition, set up meditation practices with NOD in a ceremonial setting. It is appropriate for this lesson to practice the following rituals that will change your destiny toward the better. You may use these rituals to help others. RITUAL TO CHANGE BAD LUCK INTO GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES 1. Set up your outer Rune Realm. 2. Establish your inner Rune Realm. You may use the tape for this purpose. 3.

You are now half way through your first course. Very likely you are now member of a local group, or castle, of the Knights of Runes. In this case, you benefit very much from Runic group practices. IS is a Runes that emphasizes the individual. So important is this Rune that some Rune masters of the past have put this Rune at the beginning of Runic training and of many practices. I strongly recommend that you practice this Rune thoroughly and that you explore in depth its many aspects. IS is the Rune that leads to your true ego and to your true personality. This is the ego that remains after you have gotten rid of the many illusions that make up your ego. These are in part illusions that developed as a result of you identifying yourself with the many distractions that are flooding your mind incessantly. Such distractions lead you to being attached to many things that ultimately lead to your being blocked from true advancement. There is another, more important, aspect to your true ego. To help you grasp the concept that follows I need to point out an important principle in human history. This principle says that the religion that best reflects in its doctrine and practices the methods of socio economic suppression that are prevalent in a society, will be main stream religion over all the others. Conversely, the most painful methods of socio economic suppression are incorporated in religious law and doctrine. Most of these mechanisms are so painful to the individual and to groups of humans as a whole that they can only accept them when they perceive them as being religious law, custom of the tribe, and the like. The individual is subjected to a similar condition. As soon as born, the individual suffers frustrations, deprivations, and suppression that is near impossible to accept. A process similar to the previously described one happens: the individual identifies with the reactions to these mechanisms of suppression, and he or she believes then that these reactions are part of the ego. An individual who identifies with such reactions is no longer aware of their causes, and society has gained another willful servant. It takes a strong ego to reach your spiritual goals. However, if you confound the true ego with your reactions to suppressive indoctrination, you are in a catch 22 situation. To get rid of your limitations you attempt to harness the same mechanisms that are part of your limitations. IS teaches you to find your true ego: the ego that shines through the morass of the limitations with which you are identifying yourself. IS is quite similar to the tarot card of the hermit, who has a staff that symbolizes his ego. He had to be a hermit so that he could look at his ego from a perspective that is beyond the limitations of society. The hermit, using IS, has renounced all distractions so that he can find his true ego that he needs to be ONE with his inner Self. Being ONE, he is then capable of enjoying life to 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"lesson06 its fullest, and serving society much more effectively than he ever could have done with the ego that society so skillfully has distorted. The stanza of IS in the magical poem shows the way. It says there clearly: A ninth one is mine: If danger is out in the sea To protect my good ship I conjure the wind on the billowing floods And I sing into slumber the sea. This is a clear reference to the four elements that the hermit has to master so he or she can reach the goal of Oneness with the Higher Self. Being aware of the true ego is an important step toward this goal. The ship, being solid, refers to the material plane, the earth element, or consciousness. The wind is the mind, or the air element, while the floods refer to the emotions, or the water element. The billowing floods refer to emotions that are stirred up by thought that attaches itself to futile objects of the external world and to illusions. These illusions are the result of your identifying the mapping of your perception with the object itself. Consequently, you have lost the knowledge of the difference between your picture of the world and the world as it is. Such pictures are nothing but figments of your imagination and results of your mechanisms of abstraction which in turn are subject to the illusions of a distorted ego. The act of conjuring the wind is the act of using your will, the representative of the cosmic fire element. With this will, you learn to control your thoughts that are emotionally charged, and your emotions that are running wild as a result of your having your thinking attached to them. The practice of IS teaches you how to detach yourself from your emotionally charged thoughts, and to reach a standstill of your thoughts whenever you desire to do so. Such calmed down thoughts give you the control that is necessary for your reaching the realms of your true ego. You need not go out in the woods to be a hermit, of course. All it takes is practice. With the mastery of IS, you will find it easy to control Runic energies. Therefore, you can use IS to attract Runic energies and to ground them. When you attract Runic energies with IS you are an antenna of cosmic energies. When you ground them, you act as a grounding rod. The body positions for these two practices are accordingly. You have your arms stretched above the head when you draw cosmic energies. When you ground, your arms are hanging down on the sides of your body. Runes for Healing With HAGAL, you have learned to project Runic energies to specific parts of the body. The purpose of this projection is to energize chakras or to help a healing. What follows are correlations of Runes with functions and parts of the body. With this knowledge, you can then project Runic energies to any part of the body. IMPORTANT! Before I continue here, I need to point out a very important fact. The suggestions that follow reflect the opinions of Rune masters of the past and present. As you are well aware, in the US and its territories, any healing that is not sanctioned by the appropriate authorities is ineffective and does not exist. This seems also to include any type of medical healing that is still to be discovered before it will be sanctioned by the AMA and related bodies. Because of that, Runic healing may be considered as an auxiliary placebo and should never interfere with the officially sanctioned medical treatment. A symbolism for healing The Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes are a true symbolism. As I have pointed out in previous lessons, the word \"symbolism\" implies that the position of each individual symbol in relation to all other symbols is of crucial importance. Where no such relation exists, we speak of an incoherent array of symbols. 80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"lesson06 A true symbolism typically represents the universe or any part of it. The Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes represent the system of creative energies that act in the universe. Some of the manifestations of the creative energies that connect with the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes are the world crystal, the periodic system of chemical elements, and the natural zodiac of creative energies. This natural zodiac has 18 signs. Our body is a reflection of the universe. From this follows that the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes relate to the system of creative energies in our body. Since these correlations are easy to demonstrate, the eighteen sacred Futhork Runes lend themselves to chakra balancing, chakra awakening, and healing of the fields, or systems, of creative energies in our body. TRADITIONAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN RUNES AND HERMETIC MEDICINE: Traditional In the following you find correlations and uses of the Runes in hermetic medicine. FA -- ailments of the head, feverish diseases, to burn off fat, ailments of skin and bones, purification. UR -- healing Rune in general, finds roots of ailments, neck, liver, nervous system, (when practiced in combination with IS), chest and lungs (together with OTHIL). THORN -- Aura of Health. OTHIL (for OS) -- Chest, back, neck (with UR). RIT -- Chakra of the throat. KA -- Digestive organs (with IS), feverish ailments. HAGAL -- Kidneys and bladder, loins. NOD -- Infectious diseases and skin (with LAF). IS -- Neck, liver, and nerves (with UR); Digestive tract (with KA); Accidents and injuries (with MAN); Blood, gout, arthritis, arteriosclerosis (with TYR). AR --Strengthens life force, against hallucinations, against possession. SIG -- Nerves and tendons (with MAN). TYR -- Blood, gout, arthritis, arteriosclerosis (with IS). BAR -- Female sex organs, birth. LAF -- Infectious diseases and skin. MAN -- Accidents and injuries (with IS), Nerves and tendons (with SIG). YR -- Lower abdomen, sexual organs. EH -- Against depression, balance, glands, lymphatic system. GIBOR -- Procreation; Transmutation. The preceding correlations are to be understood in many ways, depending on the level at which the Rune Magician is operating. As far as healing is concerned, the standard disclaimer is to apply: In the U.S., its territories and vessels, healing methods are only effective AFTER they have been approved by the FDA. Before such time they are quackery and should be avoided. I mentioned the above correlations only in order to give a “folkloristic” picture of the Runes. Besides, the healing effects, Runes, and especially the shape-vibrations of Rune Yoga, have strong effect upon the chakras, or spiritual centers, in the body. Projection of specific Runes upon those centers will purify them and awaken them. The Rune IS can be used to help the energetic flow up and down the spine, from chakra to chakra. RUNES AND CHAKRAS CHAKRA RUNES 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"lesson06 Crown FA, HAGAL, BAR Eye UR, KA, TYR, NOD, LAF, GIBOR Throat THORN, RIT, IS, SIG, MAN, EH Heart OS, AR, YR Solar Plexus THORN, RIT, IS, SIG, MAN, EH Spleen UR, KA, TYR, NOD, LAF, GIBOR Root FA, HAGAL, BAR You may proceed from the crown chakra to root chakra, or from root chakra to crown chakra. When mutual projecting of energy, take turns. If you are a group, several persons may project energy on one or several chakras of one person. BREATHING EXERCISES FOR WORK WITH THE CHAKRAS Reread the section on breathing in the letter of OS. You will practice a similar way as you did them. Now, however, you will inhale slowly. As you inhale, mentally sing the Rune FA, while you feel the energies of FA flow into your lungs. When you exhale, strongly imagine those energies go down the spine into the root chakra. Repeat 18 times, or 108 times if you can bring up the patience to do so. Allow yourself sufficient rest before you continue. Then, you may either proceed with the projection of FA into the root chakra, or you may decide to work with the Rune UR, which you project in your spleen chakra, then the Rune THORN in your solar plexus, next OS into the heart chakra, RIT into the throat chakra, KA into eye chakra and finally, HAGAL into the crown. At first, visualize that the energies of the Runes are cleansing and balancing the chakras. Later, you contribute to the opening and development of your chakras. Again, group practice is very effective as is shown in the lessons of Rune Yoga. What was said here will suffice for the beginning. Chakra development is a natural part of Rune Magic. CONSCIOUS EATING Just as the air you breathe contains energies that may be amplified, charged, and dynamized with Runic energies, so does food. Desires, or wishes, which are impressed in food, have a strong impact on the material and etheric planes. As a Rune Master, you will do well to consider this aspect of food, especially if you want to achieve things that have to do with the well being of your body, or if you have other material desires. The practice that is described in the following is very simple. Yet, it is consistent in its application that will ultimately lead to spectacular success. Practice with at least one meal per day. It will be good if you practice with wholesome food rather than with junk. In fact, the negative effects of junk food are well enough known, so that it will be of the best interest of the Rune Master to refrain from it all together. A healthy body is of importance for your overall progress and advancement and it is counterproductive to poison it with an average of five or more pounds of chemical food additives, \"certified\" colors, \"safe\" preservatives, fillers, and what not. (again a variation of the above disclaimer is valid: An additive that is 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"lesson06 approved by the FDA is safe until such time when the FDA decides that it is no longer safe!) You proceed as follows: 1. Sit down with your food in front of you. 2. Establish your inner Rune Realm. 3. Establish your outer Rune Realm by imagining the 18 Futhork Runes around yourself. Of course you may also actually put your Rune staves around yourself, which will give additional strength to the ceremonial effects of your practice. To establish your Rune Realm mentally allows you to practice while in the company of others. 4. Think of your wish which you want to become reality on the material levels. 5. Dynamize the wish with the appropriate Rune or Runes. 6. Draw the Rune (and attached wish) from you inner Rune Realm and project it into the food which you are going to eat. 7. When eating, be aware that the wish, and attached Rune(s), become part of yourself and of your universe, all the way down to the material levels. Be sure that nothing will be left over. You will, at a later date, understand the magical significance of this practice. Also, do not read during the meal, and any kind of conversation is undesirable, since you should eat only with your mind, emotions, consciousness, and will focused on your desire, or wish. Do not formulate two wishes at the same time. As an alternative, you may project Runic energy into your food the same way you learned to project energy in the lesson of HAGAL: by drawing and projecting with your hands, as a full Runic ceremonial. You may also arrange a magical meal with your group, proceeding as shown under the Rune HAGAL. PRACTICE THE RUNE I S 1. Copy the Song of IS in your book of ceremonials, if time allows. 2. Murmur the Song of IS. 3. Practice hand and body positions, as well as meditations of IS. 4. Practice conscious breathing for the chakras. Work as far as you feel is good for now. Practice at least with the root chakra. 5. Practice conscious eating. PREVIEW FOR THE NEXT LESSON: A R 1. About AR 2. The magic of water 3. The four elements and Rune Magic 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"lesson06 Letter of Instructions # 10 The Rune AR by Karl Hans Welz Welcome to AR, your tenth Rune. I assume that you have studied and practiced the previous letter of instructions thoroughly. Acquaintance with the Rune IS is very important for your overall advancement. Like every Rune, AR has a special message for you at this level. Above all, AR helps you deal with your \"ghosts of the past.\" Obviously dealing with your ghosts of the past will naturally lead to dealing successfully with your ghosts of and of your present and your future. Here we do not speak of “gaseous mammals” but of personal problems: You are going to overcome things of the past that are haunting you. This includes events that lead you to irrational dealing with situations. Look at the stanza of AR and meditate upon it. Focus on the non-conscious material that has accumulated during the past or your present lifetime, and, neglected by materialistic \"psychology,\" the vast material that is piled up from your past lives. This material is \"stored,\" so to say, in non-conscious levels that are still less accessible and more subtle that what psychologists usually refer to as your subconscious mind. The Rune AR has strong links with energies of the Sun. Practice of AR will help you bring to Light some of those trends that haunt you. The \"covers\" of those “evil” spirits disappear. You will recognize these spirits for what they are and you no longer need to worry about them. You know them for what they are and it is from this point of power that you are capable of effectively dealing with them. When you want to cause change on deep levels, Runes are very powerful tools. In other words, Runes allow you to work on deep- rooted change from the levels of Creation. Practice of AR is useful on many occasions of changing bad habits and, still more important, deep rooted and difficult to detect mechanisms within your psyche that consistently and repeatedly lead you to do things that cause undesirable outcomes. Practice the Song of AR! T H E M A G I C O F W A T E R Water is an external manifestation of the element that bears its name: the water element. As such, it can serve to bring you in contact with everything that is ruled by this element: Emotions, the astral worlds, the magnetic fluid on the Etheric Plane (or Higher Material Plane), life force, the magnetic component of every plane. Water, with its magnetic characteristics, may be used as an accumulator of life force, or Odic energy. And, similar as you have read about impregnating food with a wish, so can you project an idea, or wish, into water. This idea is then dynamized by the life force, or Odic force, of water. Ideally, you charge 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"lesson06 the water with raw Odic force before you impregnate the magnetic/Odic energies with your wish. Those among you who are familiar with Orgone physics may use an Orgone generator (Welz chi generator) to charge water before you impregnate it with your wish. Otherwise, you may charge water simply by holding your hands above it and visualizing Odic energy flow from your palms into the water. After you have impregnated the water with your wish, you may drink it and \"incorporate\" your wish. This process is essentially the same as conscious eating. If you consider the magnetic characteristic of water, you will also understand the many rituals of washing hands and body before religious practices. Many religious systems have washing of the hands incorporated in their ritual. You may include such washing in your magical practices. Before you begin with the practice, wash your hands. While washing imagine that everything that burdens you, all impurities, etc., are washed off. Better yet, take a bath with the same imaginations. THE FOUR ELEMENTS, THE FOUR LEVELS, AND RUNIC PRACTICES We worked already with all four elements, namely fire, water, air, and earth. Even though Runes are active on levels that are much deeper that the elementary levels, it will be of importance to have some knowledge of these levels. This is so because it is from there levels where you trigger the power of the Runes. Let's begin with the material planes. The material are the planes that academic scientists attempt to describe. To it belongs the world of space-time. Yet part of the material planes is something that science has neglected for centuries even though there is much evidence and factual basis for it. Very likely, science of academia will keep neglecting this part. I am talking about life energy and all its manifestations of life. For our purpose we divide the material planes in two sub-planes: the dense material plane, and the etheric levels of the material planes. The plane of more density represents -- in our mapping -- that which we experience (abstract) as being \"tangible.\" The etheric plane on the other hand contains that which we experience as energies which are in direct relation with what we experience as material. Of the etheric plane we know the electric fluid (or that which science describes as electromagnetic phenomena), and the magnetic fluid, which, unlike the electric fluid, is not subject to the relativistic natural laws. The magnetic fluid of the etheric plane has been denied by scientists of academia with an irrational fervor. More zealous than academic scientists are followers of a religious system that I label “pop science.” The magnetic fluid, of course, is well known to occultists and scientists who are not subject to the vested interests of corporate-controlled academic institutions. Franz Anton Mesmer called it \"animal magnetism\" and he developed devices to accumulate it. Later, Baron von Reichenbach came upon the same energy in his research, and he called it \"Od.\" We call it \"Odic energy\" or \"Odic force.\" However, whenever we speak of Odic force, we mean not only the magnetic fluid of the purely etheric planes, but we recognize that Odic force reaches into the planes beyond. This is a characteristic of life force (the magnetic fluid of the etheric plane) that will prove very useful in our later work. Korschelt named this energy \"Solar ether\" and he built machines to accumulate and generate it. Wilhelm Reich, who was born and raised in the city of Korschelt, Lwow, discovered it again and named it \"orgone energy.\" At a later point in your studies you will find out that Odic energy, or Orgone, is very important in practical magical work, especially when you want to overcome the boundaries of space-time. The material world has correlation to the earth element and consciousness, which is the expression of \"earth\" in the human being. In the course “magic of the future” I demonstrate that magic is an exact science. It is action at a distance that involves the use of life energy and structural links. Beyond the material plane we find the astral plane. Like the materials plane, the astral plane also contains the electric and magnetic fluid. However here the manifestations of electricity and magnetism are different. The astral has to do with emotions and the water element. This is the reason dynamizing and charging of water has such profound effects. Beyond the astral world, you find the mental world. The mental plane relates to the air element, thoughts, 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"lesson06 and the mind. Above the mental spheres, you find the spheres of will of the causal plane. This plane relates with to the fire element. This highest sphere, the causal plane, is also called world of emanation. Next, the mental sphere, is world of creation, then comes the world of formation, or astral, and finally, the conscious world of forms. To the \"scientist\" among you, I want to point out that, with the above, we have at our disposition a MAPPING of the world, which has proven to be USEFUL. For our practice, it is irrelevant whether this mapping is \"true\" or \"false\" according to academic logistics. We are only interested in the USEFULNESS of the mapping, which is its main criterion. We are, in our work, abstracting that which we experience on the objective, un-speakable, levels, and going to higher and higher levels of abstraction, we eventually develop theories, or mappings, which help us develop our metaphysical practices. If we reverse the path that we have taken, i.e. proceeding from the material world to the world of emanation, then we have a fairly good description of what is going on in metaphysical work: The world of emanation refers to the will which determines that something is to be done about a specific situation. The world of creation refers to the creative mind, which lays out practical ways of how to handle a specific situation, then, the astral, gives it shape by concentration of emotional forces, and finally, you have the material plane, where the change becomes manifest and conscious. An ancient and little known magical law says that, if you focus all four elements, namely will, mind, emotion, and consciousness upon one outcome, then this outcome is bound to happen. In the course of cosmic consciousness you can learn how to achieve such a focus with relative ease. To the Rune Master who sets up a ceremonial, the presence of the four elements (candle, incense, water or wine, and bread or some other symbolism of consciousness-matter-earth) is an important help. This is so because the presence of these utensils aligns the four elements without the Rune master needing to focus on it constantly. Be aware that with the consistent and repeated use of the same utensils or set-up of utensils the Rune Master develops the presence of specific metaphysical functions without him or her needing to tie up his or her mind to produce the effect. His or her mind/emotions/will/consciousness is then free for other things, and the effectiveness of the Rune practice is thus increased considerably. EXERCISE THE RUNE A R 1. Copy the Song of AR in your Book of Ceremonials, if time allows. 2. Murmur the Song of AR. 3. At least two times, while murmuring, tune into the problematic of \"ghosts of the past\". Explore your past and use AR to dynamize change. 4. Practice magic of water: project energy into a glass of water (see HAGAL), then project AR into the water. Drink the water. 5. Practice hand and body positions of AR. PREVIEW FOR THE NEXT LESSON: S I G 1. About SIG 2. Guide to Runic Exercises 3. Sounds of Runes, or Rune Mantras 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"lesson06 Letter of Instructions # 11 The Rune SIG by Karl Hans Welz SIG is another Rune that has to do with visualization. It has to do with useful mappings that bring the Rune Master to victory in the symbolic battle of life and in the struggle to reach Oneness with the Higher Self. SIG is the Light of the Sun on a spiritual level. As a Rune of success, SIG has to do with clarification, purification, freedom, and life. It symbolizes the soul and the path \"coming from God and back to God.\" Rune of spirit and of inspiration that strikes lightning like. As such, SIG has some correlation with Uranus, in an astrological sense. I take this occasion to give you a comprehensive. GUIDE TO RUNIC EXERCISES Before you begin with the Runic practice, you should have prepared yourself accordingly. 1. Establish your Outer Rune Realm. 2. Establish your Inner Rune Realm. 3. Have your body relaxed. This is necessary for proper breathing. One of the best practices to relax is the \"shavasana\" of Eastern Yoga. Lie flat on a mat with your arms slightly angled. This is the position of the SIE Rune: a variation of the Rune IS. Relax your muscles progressively. Be sure that jaws and tongue are relaxed, as well as the many small muscles around the eyes. Eyes closed, at least at the beginning of your practice. Autogenic training is an excellent way to enter a very profound state of relaxation. It is a training that is related to lengthy yoga practices, yet more effective than and much less involved. The relaxation that you achieve with autogenic training is considerably more profound than what you can achieve with the usual method of progressive relaxation. You can order the course “Autogenic Training” from the KOR. The person who practices Yoga, usually ends the array of exercises with this position. Similarly, it is good for the Rune Master to remain in this position for a while after Runic practice, after the Runic energies were properly grounded. SIE naturally follows IS. This very simple, yet important Runic position causes peace, quiet, dissolving of spasms and tension in the body, help in internal conflict situations, activation and dynamization of energies received, and spiritual illumination. 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"lesson06 4. Very important: Conscious full-breathing. Without proper control of breath, there is quite often no total success in Runic practice. Yet, that which is labeled \"breathing\" by most people, is generally nothing but a poor fragment of the breathing that should be practiced. Full breathing is composed of: a) Breathing with the diaphragm, visible in the movement of the abdomen. b) The middle breathing, where the ribcage is expanding, and c) The upper breathing, where by means of lifting the shoulders the last remaining space in the lung is filled. Full breathing combines all three ways of breathing. When inhaling, the body appears to expand in a wave- like movement, from below to the shoulders. When exhaling, this motion goes the other way. Full breathing is the basis of all existing healthful systems of breathing. You should practice this way of breathing in the position of SIE. Begin with a complete exhalation, and wait until the urge to inhale comes naturally. Next you follow some rhythm of breathing. When practicing, be sure to do so gently, and avoid strains at any cost. Be aware that gentle stimuli strengthen the life force, and very strong stimuli destroy the life force. Therefore, the gentler you train your body, the faster the desired results. Rhythms to practice: a) Inhalation: 5 seconds Hold breath: 1 second Exhalation: 5 seconds Wait for urge to inhale b) Inhalation: 4 seconds Hold: 2 seconds Exhalation: 4 seconds Pause: 2 seconds c) Inhalation: 5 seconds Hold: 3 seconds Exhalation: 7 seconds Pause: 3 seconds d) Inhalation: 3 seconds Hold: 7 seconds Exhalation: 4 seconds Pause until urge to inhale e) Inhalation: 4 seconds Hold: 16 seconds Exhalation: 8 seconds Pause until urge to inhale. Depending of goal and capability, you may extend the times of inhalation, hold, exhalation, and pause in their proper proportions. You may dynamize your breath with the imagination that you inhale Odic energies, or specific Runic energies. 5. Next preparation is to transform your body into a large vibratory field of Runic sounds. Only a good voice (speak up-front!) results in good resonance. Your voice should not appear as coming from the throat, palate, nose, or squeezed-out. Vowels should be formed up front. Practice the sounds of M, N, NG, by themselves and in connection with vowels. This practice will increase your feeling for sounds and your capability to make various parts of the body resonate with the sound. This is essential for Runic practice. 6. Thoughts are to be controlled. Observe only those thoughts that have to do with your Runic practice. Do not allow a playground for vagrant thought to unfold. 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"lesson06 7. The body needs to be trained so that it will stay in any Runic position for a while. When you are familiar with the practice of all of the above, then you are ready for more involved practice. If you have followed the exercises given in previous letters of instruction, you should not have much problem. Quite naturally, you may now ask: In what sequence should I practice Runes? This question is to be answered individually. Your Cycles of Runic energy are an important factor to consider, as well as your personal Runes. If, during your previous practices, you found one specific Rune to which you feel strong links, then you may begin every Runic practice with this Rune. You may also practice in the sequence of the FUTHORK. Whenever you are advanced to a degree where you tune into what Runes can tell you, then you will intuitively find out which sequence to use for what purpose. SOUND OF RUNES, OR RUNE MANTRAS Up to this lesson, you have learned to practice Runes by singing specific sounds. If you did not order the tape on Rune mantras yet, then you were limited to utter only the names of the Runes as mantras. However, there is much more to singing Runes than mere singing of their names. In fact, if you compare the Runes to colors of a spectrum, then the many possible ways of intoning Runes would give you the many shades and hues of a sub-spectrum for every Rune. Experience will tell you how to use those slight shades of Runic energies, and which sound is connected with what specific bundle of energies of the Runic Realms of Creation. Needless to say, what lies before you is an extensive amount of Runic practice, and only consistent, preferable daily, practice will lead to mastery of the many shades and sub-shades of the Runic spectrum. At the beginning you should exercise the Runes, one at a time, with their specific sounding of the name. It is useful to recite the Song of the Rune before practicing its mantras. Next you begin with variations: a) Change pitch and loudness of sound. Holding the same pitch, increase power of voice, then decrease again. Then change pitch, from low to high, then back to low. Practice with high pitch alone, then low pitch. Develop a feeling of the differences. Find as many combinations as possible. b) Practice with fingers close to each other, then with stretched out fingers. c) Change hand positions, palms pointing upward, then downward. d) Practice in combination with the imagination of the sound, i.e., hear the sound with your inner ear, while inhaling, also see the symbol of the Rune with your inner eye. You should be familiar with the practice if you properly learned how to establish your Inner Rune Realm. The difference is now that you practice the Rune with many different pitches. In other works, you introduce the many hues of Runic sub- spectrums into your Inner Rune Realm. This practice of visualizing while inhaling has especially strong effects on your chakras, provided you project the appropriate Runic energies in those spiritual centers of your body. e) Change and vary the sounds of the Runes by substituting vowels with other vowels, or with diphthongs. f) Next, focus on specific key-symbols of Runes, such as \"root, healing\" with UR, \"projection activity\" with THORN, etc. g) Next, you may include the body positions, changing from Rune to Rune, adjusting to the pitch, from which eventually a Runic dance develops, which makes you capable of drawing and modifying Runic energies even more powerfully and with much more versatility than you may even dream about now, especially when, once you are advanced to Rune Master, you will develop your background music to your practices. At last, some useful hints for practice of the more powerful Runic exercises and ceremonials: Before you begin, clean your body, and wash off -- symbolically speaking -- all impurities. 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"lesson06 Purify your Aura (see Runic projection in letter of instructions of HAGAL), and rub your body with good oil. The oil may contain essential oils of herbs, which are in accordance with the goal(s) that you envision. Tune consciously into the vibrations of your Runic Realms, and connect the three Runic Realms. Then you may begin the action with drawing the Rune(s) that are most in tune with you. At the end of your ceremonial or practice you should visualize an enclosure (aura) of Odic energy around yourself. As an alternative you may pose the Rune MAN, and sing MAN. This brings you in tune with the spiritual symbolism of the Holy Grail. Never forget to ground surplus energy at the end of every ceremonial, ritual, or other Runic practice. When grounding, visualize IS, pose IS in grounding-position, and visualize all surplus energy flow through your body into the ground. You may also sing the Rune, beginning with the highest possible pitch and lowering the pitch more and more, all the you see the energy flow down your body, and into the ground. This practice prevents you from being overcharged after the ceremonial. Then practicing with a group, the group as a whole is to practice the grounding. 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"lesson06 Letter of Instructions # 12 The Rune TYR by Karl Hans Welz Welcome! Welcome to TYR, the twelfth Rune. TYR is the Rune of self sacrifice. It represents the god within who self sacrifices, certain of resurrection. TYR has a strong connection with Odin's Rune Song. With TYR, you are now ready for another initiation. This time it is an initiation that is not so much an exterior one such as the knighting ceremony. This initiation is an inner one. It shows you the futility of worldly life when such a life is not well rooted in spirit. The initiation in TYR also gives you an experience of the power of Thor's Hammer. However, to experience this power you need to learn to use this powerful tool correctly and responsibly. The initiate of TYR expands into the vibrations of the Norse god Thor. With this initiation you will follow a ritual of renouncing, then returning. In Christian mythology this ritual is symbolized by the self sacrifice of Jesus, who then descends into the abyss so that he will return as the Christ. This ritual is a dramatization of the process of the human nature within us which rejoins Christ consciousness, or the Higher Self. In the Norse religion, the god Odin recognizes the need of gaining access to the realms of creation to be a full being. He removes himself from all worldly situations. For nine cold nights he hangs on the tree of life. The nine refers to the Rune Is and its relation to the true ego. Perhaps you remember that Jesus was crucified in the ninth hour! As the poem says, this tree \"conceals man, from whose roots man sprung.\" Odin gains awareness of the roots of the tree of life and recognizes there the energies of creation, the Runes. This shows that Odin's Rune Song is highly symbolic. It has little to do with physically hanging from a tree and piercing out a physical eye with a physical spear. You need to gain an understanding of the symbolic meaning of Odin's Rune Song before you can attempt an initiation of TYR. Then the initiation helps you gain a Christ consciousness like union with the realms of creation. Here I repeat Odin's rune Song: I know myself hanging on the wind cold tree for nine icy nights. Wounded by the spear, consecrated to Wodan I consecrated to myself. I was hanging on the mighty tree which conceals man Where man grew out of its roots. 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"lesson06 They offered me neither bread nor wine So I bent down in search. I recognized the Runes; wailingly I grasped them. Until I sank down from the tree. Now I began to increase, to be wise, To grow and to feel well. From the word, word grew after word And deed shaped to deeds with deeds. Now I know the songs like no wise one knows And none of the children of men. And should these songs, o human child, be unlearnables to you for sheer endless time; Grasp them as you get hold of them, use them as you hear of them. Hail you if you retain them! Let's point out here: Odin hangs on the wind cold tree for nine icy nights. The wind refers to the mind. The nine to the Rune Is and so does the ice, frozen water. Remember the Rune Stanza of Is: A ninth one is mine, if danger is out in the sea ... Not only is Odin exposed to the elements outside him, but also within. Obviously the realm of a human being does not end with its skin. Odin is exposed to the elements on the world tree. He is exposed in an eternal cycle that can only be overcome when time itself has been recognized as being irrelevant. Odin has to sink down to the roots of time to recognize the Runes, forces of creation. Odin wounded himself with the spear. The human karma blinds humans. A misdirected will gives up an eye. Too much concern with karma that results from \"past\" (and future?!) lives may bring even more attachment to the material planes of the life tree and the shackles that bind to the tree become even stronger. Only by gaining access to the creative realms can Odin re-gain his Divine nature. Because Odin knows well that he will not handed redemption on a silver platter, but that the human being has to strive to attain Divinity, he bends down in search. This means that he focuses on the roots of all existence, symbolized by the tree and its roots. There he recognizes the energies from the creative realms, or roots: the Runes. He accepts them as a way of life. This is acceptance of karmic structure from a point that lies beyond karma itself. Once the karmic bondage is overcome, Odin can free himself from the tree. Now he is master of his destiny. To be capable of passing the initiation of TYR you should be well grounded in the inner and outer Rune realms. In previous lessons you should have practiced the basics of Runic ceremonial. It will be good if you do have a set of ceremonial utensils. You may delay the ceremonial of TYR to a later time. It is not an absolute requirement to pass this lesson. However you should have passed it before your initiation to Rune Master. If you have started your castle with regular meetings, the members of your castle may be a valuable assistance to your initiation. For your initiation to being a Knight of THOR you need: 1. Thor’s Hammer. You may use a cardboard hammer in which you write your name. An ideal tool is the silver Hammer of Thor that you can receive from the Knights of Runes. This hammer has the Bindrune SIG- TYR inscribed. 2. An incense burner. 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"lesson06 3, Runic incense, Frankincense, or Sandalwood 4. A cup or glass with wine or water. 5. An altar candle. 6. An altar. A simple table with a white cloth will do. 7. A rune dagger, power rod, or wand. A power rod is a metal pipe that is coated with Life energy accumulating material. You can order it from the Knights of Runes. 8. A set of Rune Staves, ideally Crystal Staves. 9. A personal candle inside the circle or square. 10. The tape to introduce you to the inner Rune realm. This is not necessary! The initiation of TYR takes some preparation and it takes some time. The energies with which you connect as a result of your initiation will be important for your further advance and understanding. Initiation to Knight of Thor Preparation: For seven days prior to the initiation be sure not to overindulge in food or drink. Make sure that you are in as good a physical shape as you can be. Prepare your ceremonial utensils. Take a bath before the initiation. This symbolizes purification. Wear clean clothes or a robe. Set up the altar. Bless the water or wine before you set it on the altar: “This is the blood of life that contains the power of the realms of creation Put the personal candle in the middle of the altar.

Welcome to BAR, the thirteenth Rune. BAR is your first Rune to experience after your initiation as a Knight of Thor. With this Rune you have an opportunity to touch on the realms from which existence sprouts, especially life. In ancient mythology this state carries the name of Chaos. Chaos is that mysterious state before time and space, or at the root of time-space. Since it is before time, Chaos IS. With the Rune BAR you learn to experience that the formation of worlds, of universes, and of life itself is not a process that happened eons ago. With the proper understanding of time, a person can be utterly amused at the famous Sunday school question as to \"where this all came from.\" Bar teaches that the universe comes from chaos rather than having come from chaos long ago. Creation is a continuous process and the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes are among the first manifestations of creation. Bar touches upon the threshold of creation. It is not structure yet. The beginning creative structures are expressed by UR, Rune of the root of time space and by YR, Rune of the three Norns, goddesses of destiny. In its esoteric expression BAR is the realm to which the Rune Master descends to be born again, certain of resurrection. While TYR represents the self sacrifice that preceded the taking of new form, BAR represents the process of rebirth itself. Mythologically speaking, the god descends back into chaos, back into the womb, before experiencing rebirth. In Christian mythology Jesus descended \"to hell\" before resurrecting. The Catholic credo reflects that. Catholic priests feel a bit uneasy when confronted with the question why Jesus did go to the devil. Often they conveniently invent a realm that is sort of a den to hell. Religious outfits are as credible as chemical corporations who manufacture “safe and effective” drugs! In all patriarchalistic religions with their typical rage against women and life, the original meaning of this process was forgotten. BAR is decomposition as much as it is life that sprouts from it anew. Old structure goes to make place for new structure. In this respect BAR carries a characteristic of the planet Pluto. It is a prime Rune of life force of the origin. BAR provides freedom from restrictions of space-time. Therefore BAR is an ideal Rune to use when you begin to explore new capabilities such as clairvoyance and ESP. It is a Rune that introduces you to meditation practices that can lead to the depths that are useful to acquire these skills. In this case BAR helps decompose the old rigidified structure so that you can acquire new skills. By means of deep meditation BAR loosens up the rigid structures of indoctrination that have been imposed on all of us. 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"lesson06 Therefore BAR is one of the primary Runes that you can use to enhance your psychic and magical powers. BAR helps you free yourself from the restrictions of time itself. This practice compares to the following: You may envision time like the map of a city. As long as you are in one of the streets of the city, you see something that lies before you and something that is behind you. At times you come to crossroads and you feel a need to choose. When you elevate yourself above the city you see that whole of it at once. You see what's behind, what's before, and the crossroads. With the Rune BAR you can elevate yourself beyond the confines of space-time into the eternal Now that shows you past, present, and the infinite mesh of time- lines. The mathematician sees this mesh as a Gaussian (\"curved\") space. The Rune GIBOR and, even more so, the FYRFOS (fire foot) represent this structure of the eternal Now beautifully. BAR represents the eternal creative Now. It teaches us that the zero is not a nothing but that it may well be regarded as a balance of forces. Once you touch the equilibrium of this balance you create \"out of nothing.\" Ancient mythologies saw in chaos the realm that contained everything and nothing. According to ancient mythology it is from chaos that the oldest gods come from. These mythologies recognized an important fact, namely that gods are created. They did not yet fall into the fallacy that postulates that some well-structured deity created the universe way in the past. However, having no valid concept of time, they usually put the emergence from chaos way back into the past rather than recognizing it as a continuous process that happens at the roots of time. Time is \"created at all times,\" or time emerges continuously from roots that are ubiquitous as do many other phenomena. Some modern pop- physicists call this state the \"zero energy\" or tachyonic energy. BAR opens us up to an important realm: the realm of the threshold of chaos where structure begins to emerge. In its most simplified meaning, BAR represents death and birth, day and night, life and light. It represents these things not as isolated but as an all encompassing unity. Structure in space-time is light energy, forming life relates to darkness and chaos. We are living beings in a structured universe of light. Here we have to refrain from attaching emotional values to the terms of light and life. Such misguided emotional values are the result of indoctrination by one sided patriarchalistic religion which by its nature is hostile to life. The structured universe by itself is an illusion. It gains reality when we connect it with life. Love brings life to the lifeless universe. With BAR you learn to see life as a whole from a point beyond. You perceive life in its wholeness that encompasses all its aspects. Therefore BAR is truly a Rune of birth as well as it is a Rune of death. Bar perceives the human being as a whole. It perceives the human form as a whole consisting of that which lives in the universe and that which exists in transition. BAR contains all aspects of creation. It contains life and death, sprouting and decomposition, time and time-lessness. The Higher Self manifests at the precise point where Chaos is touched. This is a truth that religionists will never grasp as long as they worship a personal male god who, structure himself, usually claims to \"have created\" the universe. The idea of a gaseous mammal of the male sex who lives above the clouds prevents us effectively from deeper insights into the workings of the universe. Our innermost being is also our outermost one. The depth of our life experience touches upon the farthest reaches of the structured universe that consciousness causes us to experience. The concepts of BAR reach far beyond any one of the concepts that organized religions can ever hope to offer. To benefit from these concepts is very simple. So simple indeed is the loving union of formative chaos and established form that it takes most of us decades, even lifetimes, to learn. Going back to chaotic experience is near impossible for the person who has been conditioned to perceive structures only, nothing but structures, and then still more structures and hierarchies of existence. Too many persons who try to gain knowledge of the universe do so in the typical Luciferian way of gaining more and more knowledge about it. They do not know the simple fact that, regardless how many formulas they create and how much they describe in terms of knowledge, there will always be characteristics left out. BAR teaches us the lesson that knowledge has to combine with the loving touch of the threshold of Chaos. Those persons who are unwilling to take the risk of simply letting go and immersing themselves into the female forces of formation and creation are the \"living dead\" in the meaning that Jesus gave to this word. Jesus himself \"descended to hell,\" which means that he touched upon the chaotic threshold of creation before being born again in His resurrection. We have to let go of our cherished way of identifying with the maps of our experiences or, worse still, to identify with the maps that a collective subjectivity tries to indoctrinate us with. Bar teaches us that the root to our spiritual rebirth is within ourselves. The external form, or creed, that may lead to it is a help at best. It cannot do the job for us. BAR helps you in your descent into the underworlds. This descent is a metaphor for getting in tune with the threshold of creation. You find it in most religious systems. From this descent the shaman is born 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"lesson06 again. From this descent the founder of a world religion resurrects, giving the mythological example of what we have to do to reach Divinity. Descent to the underworld, eternal birth and transition, and eternal transformations are ideas of which most large religious systems can only give hints without understanding the deep realities that lie behind their pompous myths. The practitioner of evocative magic understands the touching of the creative reality as a descent to the mothers. Here we tend to experience the eternal creative life force as mother. It is a dangerous path for the magician who is incapable of letting go of cherished mappings. This is so because this descent confronts the magician with the formless, shapeless, and unstructured energetic ocean from which life comes forth in its manifold manifestations. Bar is the \"womb\" from which the phenomena that we experience are born and it is the grave to which they return. Time as we experience it is one of these perceived phenomena. Being of such a flexible nature, BAR will reveal many of its uses with practice and with practice only. ROBES Ceremonial magicians give much importance to the clothing that they wear. Of special significance is the color of the robe, sometimes the shape of the robe and especially the symbols that are attached to it. All of this reflects the ceremonial that the wearer of the robe intends to perform. Some practitioners, especially those who are part of the old religion, operate nude. They understand nudity as an expression of their freedom. Robes are magical utensils. When you use a magical utensil repeatedly you attach ideas, or energies, onto it. When you perform a ceremonial with such a \"charged\" utensil present you need no longer use your powers to bring in these energies that the utensil represents. The more routine the use of a specific energy or group of energies, the more useful is a utensil representing it. On the other hand it makes little sense to create a utensil that you use just once. When you use a utensil you can ensure that the energies the utensil represents are present. You can the focus your attention on more specific parts of the ritual that you perform. You can see utensils as part of a machinery on the spiritual levels that you have present to perform very specific tasks at each ritual. Robes are no exception to that. They take the aspect of magical utensils and so do a painted body and even nudity. Another function of a robe, of a painted body, or nudity, is equally important. A ceremonial operation requires to some extent that the practitioner gets rid of his/her limitations of the everyday world and enters another realm of existence. A cleansing ritual such as a ritual bath or fasting does that to some extent. With the robe, nude body or painted body the practitioner creates a new set of energies. This procedure then alters the practitioner's view of the universe. A new set of limitations is valid. More important still, the old limitations are no longer as strong as in everyday life. When the practitioner uses the robe, nudity, or body paint to be born into a realm that transcends everyday limitations, envisioned change becomes possible, even easy. In this respect, the wearing of a robe, nudity, or body paint connect with the Rune BAR. Perhaps you will understand this situation of being born into another realm better after you will have considered the following: Under \"normal circumstances\" you experience many limitations. Some limitations are good for you while others are blocking you. The average person tries to overcome some of the undesirable limitations such as psychological difficulties from within a state where these same limitations are active, i.e., from the normal waking state. Quite often their friendly neighborhood psychologist or counselor encourages to do so, for a hefty fee, of course. The person who makes such an attempt is confronted with a catch-22 situation that makes the task of overcoming a specific situation very difficult, if not impossible. On the other hand, when the person who desires change alters his/her consciousness, e.g., in a hypnotic state, a new set of limitations emerges. The strength of the limitations of the \"normal state\" is considerably reduced. Consequently change is possible, quite often even very easy, in such an altered state. If you develop the skill of changing between many different sets of limitations, or states of consciousness, you will have the tool of dynamically achieving nearly everything that you envision. The hypnotist is well aware of this fact and so is the preacher of a charismatic church. This points out the importance of a robe or of changed appearance after a ritual cleaning off the old 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"lesson06 limitations. The robe or nudity allows shift into new states of consciousness with alternate limitations without any long induction or introduction. The power of such a rebirth and the depth of the new state of consciousness is a result of the practitioner's own imagination and of the specific appearance of the robe and the surroundings that the practitioner builds for this purpose. The spiritual name that the practitioner may have is another such tool. It too relates to a state of rebirth. The same thing that we have said about robes or nudity applies to the spiritual name that the practitioner uses. Baptism and cleansing rituals belong to the realm of the Rune BAR. From this point the robe, nudity, or body paint emerge. Robes in Runic Ceremonial Most of the time the robe of a magician represents the form of energy that is present in the ceremonial. For each planetary energy there is a robe in the color of the planet: gold for the Sun, silver or white for the Moon, green for Venus, red for Mars, blue for Jupiter, yellow for Mercury, and violet for Saturn. Runes too have their colors, but these colors are more flexible than the planetary colors. There is no rigid color code per se but rather some preferences of several colors for each Rune. Most of the time FA will appear in red or orange, sometimes in blue or green and much less frequent in any other color. UR likes black when referring to its quality as root energy. It is appearing in green, the color of Venus, when its creative energies help the processes of healing. Likewise is YR black when relating to its quality as maker of destiny and green when needed for love. Color appearance of each Rune adjusts to the purpose for which you use the Rune. It is obvious that you cannot afford hundreds of robes in order to adjust to the specific requirements of a Runic operation. Nudity is a good alternative when circumstances allow it. Body paint can help. A good Runic robe is one that brings you in good contact with the creative realms. The closer it relates to the chaotic roots of creation the more powerful the symbolism of the robes will be. Therefore the black robe will provide you with the dynamics of being born again. The white robe in Runic work refers to structure in creation. A good all round robe is in blue color. Use golden color for sigils on the robe. Where the situation allows you should wear the robe over the naked body. The traditional material for the robe is linen. Cotton is fine. Silk gives good protection (insulation) and so do synthetics. Practice -- the Rune BAR 1. Set up your outer Rune realm, enter your inner Rune realm and tune into the energies of BAR. 2. Murmur the Song of BAR 3.

Welcome to LAF, the fourteenth Rune of the Sacred Futhork. With this Rune you will have the opportunity to enter the realms of original law, or the law of life. LAF is also the Rune of the original water, or the water of life. There seems to be a consensus that the water of life is some mythological \"fountain of youth.\" Many adventurers tried to discover this fountain of youth. I have to point out that there is something deeper in the meaning of this symbol. To come to a deeper understanding of this term, you need to first cone to grips with the symbolic meaning of water. When there is talk of water in educated esoteric circles, there is often a reference to both the water element and its realm and to the astral realms. The astral realms are the sphere of manifestation for most energies of a higher order, or entities, before they can descend into the material realms. The descent into the material realms can only happen with the help of a material being such as a human. Even entities that are not purely astral, but much more complex, need the astral plane as a gate to enter the material plane. In this context it is good that you meditate over the stanza of LAF: A Fourteenth I sing To all the assembled people And I name the Divine Names For no one knows the names Of all Albes and Ases As well as I do. Clearly there is reference to names. An old magical idea is that once you know the name of an entity you have it under your control. The references to Light beings (Albes, or elves) and gods (Ases or Aesir) are obvious. LAF, then, is a way to control the beings of the finer densities BEFORE they descend into the 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"lesson06 material plane. Compare this way to the path that many a channeler takes, namely to let an astral entity enter his or her body (materialize) without knowing how to control it, without having the will to control it, often even without knowing its true name and without ever finding out the true name of that entity. There is more to that concept of the water. Water has a clear reference to the etheric level on the material plane where an entity manifests. This is life energy. Life energy has other names such as prana, chi, orgone, or animal magnetism. I have been able to photograph many entities when I supplied them with an adequate amount of life energy from the Chi generators that I invented. For these photographs I did not need a special camera, but a simple Polaroid camera was sufficient! This goes hand in hand with the Voodoo concept that you need to feed the entity that you have do the work. The feeding technique is always a way to set free sufficient amounts of life energy. The water of life, therefore, is the magnetic fluid on the etheric plane. This matter of a fine density has many names such as prana, chi, orgone, mana, and animal magnetism. The ancients clearly recognized that life emanates from prana. Wilhelm Reich brought scientific proof of this important fact. The same energy is also good for rejuvenation. Therefore the concept of the \"fountain of youth\" is not too far away from reality. However, closer examination of this energy proves that the famous fountain of youth is actually within ourselves. The orgone energy ocean that surrounds us is the inexhaustible source of life energy. To find the fountain of youth means to discover for ourselves the practices that help us harness life energies. This fountain of youth helps us keep in good shape throughout the period of our life. About Eternal Life As long as mankind existed there have been glib talkers who claimed that they found the secret not only to eternal youth, but also to eternal life. As a matter of convenience, they generally used concepts of the metaphysical trends that were accepted at the time by most of their targets, then they modified the concepts for their purpose. There is something else that helps these hucksters. Aging people are jealous of the younger generation. This jealousy is often on a non-conscious level. As a consequence they may go one of two routes. They either tend to buy into a doomsday cult that claims that the end is near (you youngsters cannot enjoy life that long any more, because the end is near, ha ha ha haaa!) or they fall for the promise of eternal life. A simple analysis of a history of both of these trends can quickly convince any thinking person what these claims are worth. Both trends exist at least as long as we can follow history. Neither trend ever kept what they promised. We know that the world still exists and we know of nobody that lived eternally. In our days only one group is rivaling the Witnesses of Jehovah in the amount of ludicrous false doomsday prophesies. This group are the New Agers. For years I had the fallacious thought that this group might be a bit more sophisticated than religious fanatics. This seems not to be the case. A word to those who dream of eternal life: it does make sense to live a healthy life that will naturally extend the life time and its quality. To extend life beyond that point is of little use. This would compare to keep yourself from going to sleep. The average life span of the human animal has its root in the genetic code. This genetic trait of the average life span (or of aging) has evolved because the average life span of the human being is optimal for survival of the species. It is the result of an evolutionary process that established a perfect balance between the human species and its environment. None of the eternal life hucksters have talked about gene changing ... yet! Mr. Cheapak Dopra comes close! The evolved living being knows that there is no death, but only a continuous transformation. Consequently fear of death is a tragic illusion. The dream of extending one's life span forever compares well to the wish of the little child to stay awake forever! Both behaviors are the mark of childish ignorance. Both behaviors prove to be unhealthy in the long run. This does not mean that we should not benefit from the waters of life, or the fountain of youth. This gift 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"lesson06 allows us to live our lives to the fullest as healthy and vigorous human beings. Eternal Life Energy at the Roots of the Universe Modern researchers have demonstrated that life energy is not just something that acts independently of the electromagnetic ocean of the universe. There is no life energy that may be conceived as opposing or existing besides electromagnetic energies. Both etheric energies are part of the same phenomenon: the etheric level which is part of the material plane. Light and Life are a manifestation of opposites that come forth from chaos. Both forms of energy set up universes according to their specific characteristics. The time-space continuum is the mark of light energy, while the magical universe is the mark of life energy. That is the reason for the importance of life energy in magical work. It is life energy that makes magical work possible. It is life energy that it at the root of sending magical energy to a target that is thousands of miles away. It is life energy that allows energies of a higher order (entities) to manifest in the material planes. Entities can only have effect if they manifest at these planes. That is the law of magic that the Rune LAF teaches us. It is the law of the water of life. It is the law of the famous fountain of youth that is within ourselves. The Hierarchies of Entities I have talked about energies of a higher order, or entities. LAF teaches us the names of these entities. In this aspect, LAF is the gate that opens for us the gates to the spheres where the deities dwell. If we learn to name the names of the entities, we can learn their characters, what they can do for us, and how we can establish contact with them so that they perform work for us. In some instances it is useful to regard entities, or deities, as energies of a higher order. You have learned about the four planes that correspond to the four elements. The material plane relates to the fire element or to consciousness. It is the plane where things manifest. Of the material plane we divide into the dense material plane and into the etheric plane. We may see the dense material plane as a plane where the etheric forms are \"frozen, so to say.\" The etheric plane contains the two energy forms, light energy (the electromagnetic spectrum) and life energy (orgone, chi, prana, etc.). Etheric and dense materials are to extremes of the material plane. Nothing that we know in the material plane is totally \"dense\" or structured, and nothing is totally structure-less or form-less. The astral plane relates to our emotions. Astral energies are energies in the state of formation. After this the mental plane follows. It is the plane where ideas and mental images form. Our thinking is perception of mental forms. Energies that connect with the mental plane can manifest and they have the characteristic of being able to personify. Therefore we perceive these energies as entities: gods, angels, devas, ... you name it. The fourth plane connects with the will. It is the causal plane. This plane contains what we may call the Divine spark or the Divine impulse. In this plane the impulse of manifestation emerges. Some of the traditional magicians claim that the astral plane has space but no time and that the mental plane has time but no space. This model reflects the work that we can do when connecting with the respective planes. We need to keep in mind that we always connect with all four planes. Traditional magicians call this a four- polarity. Many entities have no four fold polarity, but they live as thought forms with an emotional body, bi- polar. They need four polar beings to manifest. For this reason I prefer the label \"Higher Order Energies\" (HOE's) for entities rather than gods, spirits, angels, etc. This label clarifies better the relation that these entities have with us. 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"lesson06 In each one of the planes, the Runes represent the least structured end. In the material plane they represent near-unstructured light and life energies. In the astral plane they represent near un-shaped astral beings, or emotions. In the mental plane Runes represent thoughts in the process of forming, and in the causal plane they represent the impulse in the process of forming. Runes are closest to the chaotic state. Other energies such as the zodiacal forces, gods, angels, etc., are much more defined. The Rune LAF takes a position that allows us to define the deities that we decide to call \"by its name.\" Therefore LAF allows us to know the names of the Albes and Ases, of light beings and gods. LAF is true love that creates by interacting life energies (the water of life or the fountain of youth) with chaos. About Evocation An important part of the metaphysical process that leads to self actualization is the capability to use and direct the energies of the universe. This includes the conscious contact with the HOE's, deities, devas, genii, etc. These energies have the capability to appear as persons. This is why we perceive them as spirits. These energies, or spirits, are classified into hierarchies that reflect their action, their strength, and their importance in relation to us. There are many ways to classify these spirits. The earliest methods of this kind reflect in the many mythologies that humans have created. Each mythology connects with the reality of the worlds of entities, or energies of a higher order. Although all of the mythologies are very useful, we have to dismiss the claims of some of them that they are the only acceptable \"truth.\" Such claims block the progress of the individual, which in some of the above cases is in the interest of the ruling classes that push one and one only mythology. Hierarchies, then, are models that we make to put some order into the many energies of a higher order. The entities result from our focus on specific ranges of these energies. Since they are models, we can custom tailor them to any mythology. Several excellent classifications, or hierarchies of entities, connects with the reality of astrological structures. These astrological hierarchies have all the marks of true symbolisms. This is so because in a true symbolism the position of each entity in relation to all other is of crucial importance: If you know the structure of a true symbolism and the meaning of one of its basic elements you can deduce the meanings of all other elements of the symbolism. The hierarchies that were derived from the astrological system are the cabalistic system and the system of spherical magic. The process of evoking an entity is the following: You zero-in on one specific spirit. You do this with the spirit's \"name,\" symbol (sigil), etc. Then you give the command that the spirit manifests on the conscious- material plane. The spirit can only manifest if you give it the appropriate atmosphere, i.e., if you provide it with the material substance to materialize. This substance is life energy. LAF is the Rune that gives you the flexibility in choosing the appropriate hierarchy and spirit for your evocation. LAF gives you also the means to actually create an infinite amount of hierarchies of devas, angels, etc., that fit exactly your needs. This you find in the part of the stanza of LAF that says \"for no one knows the names of all the Albes and Ases as well as I do!\" To recognize and experience the structures and hierarchies of \"divine\" beings and their mutual relationships is theology. Theology is a Greek word that means knowledge of the gods. The skill to interact with these beings and to put them to work is theurgy, or the command over gods. The next step is to 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"lesson06 actually create these hierarchies. We call this process theogenesis. Theogenesis means the creation of gods. A prerequisite for successful theogenesis is a command over the forces of creation. The Runes are a set of creative energies that we can command. Theogenesis is at the root of the most powerful practices in metaphysical and magical work. The Power to Change In your normal conscious state you live under a specific set of limitations. At some point you are unwilling to accept some of these limitations. To overcome them while in this normal conscious state is very difficult: How can you overcome limitations from a state that contains the same limitations? The whole thing is like a catch-22 situation: You try to overcome limitations while employing the same limitations that you try to overcome. If you alter your state of consciousness, you are no longer exposed to the \"old\" limitations. In such an altered state other limitations may be valid, but they do not interfere with your envisioned process of change. Therefore change becomes possible. The Rune LAF connects with the universe and its basic laws. Therefore you can use LAF to create alternate universes. These alternate universes have their own laws and limitations. The limitations differ from the limitations of the \"normal\" universe. Change becomes possible. In this respect the Rune LAF is the gate of very powerful technologies of change. Practice -- The Rune LAF 1. Practice LAF as outlined in previous lessons. Give special attention to body postures and hand positions. 2. Invoke LAF and experience the symbolic meaning of the fountain of youth and the water of life. 3. Tune meditatively into the Divine hierarchies. First tune into Divine hierarchies of your own religious background, then explore other religions. 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"lesson06 Letter of Instructions # 15 The Rune MAN by Karl Hans Welz THE RUNE MAN MAN is the fifteenth Rune of the Sacred Futhork. It is one of the most noticeable Runes. You have already worked with MAN in previous letters of instruction. This was necessary, because indeed there are few Runic ceremonials that do not call upon the energies of the Rune MAN in one way or another. In fact, so tremendous can be the energies of MAN and (less noticeable, yet fully active) YR that both of those Runes could well be substituted for FA and UR at the beginning of the symbolism. MAN together with YR forms HAGAL, the mother of the Runes. MAN is the crown and branches of the world tree, Yggdrasil, while YR signifies the roots of the world tree. MAN is the symbol of man, of humanity, which strives toward the spiritual, all the while it is conscious of its roots of destiny. It is the principle of the Higher Self. A fully aware person, however, has to be aware of its roots -- in YR! In Christian mythology, Christ has to descend to its roots for three (!) days. The fully aware person has to be one with the three goddesses of destiny, the Norns, before he/she will reach effortlessly Oneness with the Divine Higher Self. Look closely at the stanza: A fifteenth I count, that which Volkrast the gnome Sang by the gates of the day To strength for the ashes, to force the Albs And to clear my own senses. The gnome refers to the fourth element: to consciousness. The gates of the day have a reference to the creation into humanity, the bursting into existence which springs forth from the roots of destiny, the Norns. MAN strengthens the determination to achieve spiritual Oneness, here symbolized by the Ases (or Aesir, the Nordic Gods), but it also helps overcome material limitations. 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"lesson06 MAN is the Rune of the human being who resurrects. It is the Rune of the god-man, of power, of Divine, spiritual, magic. MAN clears the perception and it opens the senses and perception. The mantra of MAN is ideal to awaken the third eye. The vibration of M and N, when sung properly, make the whole skull vibrate, and center upon the pineal gland and the area of the third eye. It not only cleanses, but it makes clairvoyant. It helps perceive the human worlds as well as the Divine worlds. It makes you grow beyond the tallest of the world trees. MAN can also give strength on the material planes, and it is, together with UR, IS and AR, used for experimentation with levitation and to lift heavy objects. MAN increases and gives wealth. When looking \"downward\" (or inward), then MAN opens up the secrets of MIMIR, or original memories that are seated in the Norns of YR. MAN helps explore YR the same way as YR helps explore MAN. Original memories are contained in the world-Crystal. PRACTICE OF MAN Practice of MAN is self-explanatory. It is Runic practice at its strongest impact, and strongest perceived. The body position of MAN protects against hostile influences, it keeps away dangerous psychic influences, and it strengthens the etheric hull of protection (Odic hull); and so does the symbol of MAN. It also helps achieve quiet, strength, and health. It awakens the understanding of many spiritual characteristics of the Runic symbolism, and provides inspiration by drawing the spiritual manifestation into the womb of destiny, represented by the Norns of YR. MAN contains a KEY to all other Runes and to the Runic symbolism as a whole. Especially Runic meditations with MAN will open up your understanding of the Runic symbolism. Therefore, it is useful to practice MAN while being within your inner Rune realm. An interesting practice with MAN may be an experiment with levitation, at its beginning, with making heavy objects appear lighter. Put both hands, right upon left hand, on a heavy object, sing the mantra of MAN, then withdraw hands and shake them, as if you were shaking out heaviness. Repeat three times. Then lift. The same experiment may be performed with people, where two (or four) persons lift a heavy person just with the index fingers. In this case, the hands of all participants are alternately laid upon the head of the subject, with the same procedure of chanting and shaking followed. MEDITATIONS WITH MAN This letter of instructions will familiarize you more thoroughly with Runic meditations, which will greatly expand your knowledge of, and your connection with a Rune. No Rune appears to be a better choice for tuning into spiritual vibrations than MAN, for it even strengthens the gods (ases or aesir). To perform very effective meditations, a ceremonial set up is of great help. Of course, you may also meditate by simply tuning into a Rune. The set-up 1. Arrange your altar: cup, candle, incense burner, dagger or power rod. Set up the Rune circle around 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"lesson06 you. Candle in the center of the circle. 2.

Set up your outer Rune Realm. 4. Take Runes dagger, or power rod, trace Rune circle around you, then draw the HAGAL Rune in all four directions, beginning with North (position of FA Rune), next West, South, and East. Each time you draw the HAGAL Rune, do so with the strongest possible imagination of protection and Oneness with the Universe. 5. Light the altar candle and say: \"Forces of the Light Eternal in the universe, Penetrate darkness! Sacred flame, shine! Bring light to the night! All around darkness All around night I amidst the Light Darkness is penetrated By the light. Light candle in center and say: Original fire of FA Burning from the roots Of times Light force of AR Born in the Sun At the roots of the worlds, Give Light to the seeker!\" 6. Light incense and say: \"May the power of the Runes Lead me to a greater understanding Of the universe and myself!\" 7. Hold both hands over the cup with water (or wine which is thinned with water). Project the energies of MAN into the cup. Drink part of the water (or wine). 8. Look at Thor's Hammer. Be aware that this brings your consciousness in tune with the Rune MAN. Hold both hands over it, knowing of its power. 9.

Not only does the language of the stanzas seem incomprehensible, but also work with the Runes, once some of their general meanings have been accepted. To understand the meaning of YR, one has to come to a full understanding of the Rune MAN. Neither YR nor MAN can fully stand by themselves. If they stood by themselves a great portion of their power would be lost. True, for the person who is biased toward the more \"spiritual\" nature of man, too often to the extent of totally looking down on consciousness-matter, or the fourth element, MAN comes easier, yet this is NOT the full scope on MAN. YR appears as the reversion of MAN, in its graphic representation as well as in the body position. If you look at the body positions, you will notice that the left hand draws energy from the universe and the right hand directs it back to the universe. In cases of MAN, you draw \"from above\" and project back to \"above.\" In the case of YR, draw and projection go \"below.\" The symbolism is clear. While MAN refers to that which we call \"spiritual,\" YR refers to consciousness- matter. Not the dense matter of the material level, but matter on all levels, astral, mental, and spiritual included. It is exactly a one-sided perception of matter, which made it so difficult for many Rune Masters in the past to truly comprehend the meanings of YR, which represents the roots of the world tree, Yggdrasil, while MAN 113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"lesson06 represents the crown of the tree. YR also relates to the three Norns, goddesses who spin the threads of destiny (of consciously perceived destiny): Urda, the ever present, Verdandi, the ever becoming, and Skuld, karmic debt, or structure. YR, in the meaning of many Rune Masters, represents the illusion of matter. Again, here we deal with a bias that considers matter to be evil and women as evil. It's not matter per se that is to be considered an illusion, but human thinking which says all too often that our perception and labeling of our perception are the things that they describe. Such thinking limits the scope of our dealing with our environment and ultimately rigidifies us in that illusion. YR can be considered a Rune of mappings, or of theories which we make of our worlds. If we think that the theory is reality, then we have succumbed to illusion. If we take the theory as a tool, then we are flexible enough to change mappings whenever needed. Ultimately, it does not matter whether a theory is true or false (true or false according to what??? another theory??? biased \"academic\" standards that have a history of opposing useful innovations???), but whether it is useful. We have to keep in mind that the world that we perceive is result of processes of abstraction. Further abstracting leads to theories of some sort. The factual basis, which consists of things perceived, therefore has only limited validity. So do facts resulting from inferences. In their interactions with their environment, humans developed theories, based on some structural \"metaphysics\" of their thinking, regardless whether they deal with facts of a spiritual nature, or with \"objective\" scientific thought (or bias of academia). Objectivity appears as an illusionary subjectivity of a larger body of human beings, of masses, of a scientific body, of some religious group, etc. It changes continuously, as history proves will. Interesting enough, regardless of this continuous shift, many persons involved in seeking \"truth,\" scientific, religious, or otherwise, think that what they have found NOW, or what was revealed or channeled to them LATELY, is the ultimate truth. All they need to do is look backwards in history in order to understand the continuous pattern of emergence of such illusion throughout history and the ultimate futility of such assumption. There is no factual basis known to me, from which you could not derive infinite many theories, or mappings, of the specific world (or set of phenomena) which make up this factual basis. Every lawyer could tell you that: You have a group of facts, you have hundreds of interpretations of those facts available, and what the lawyer tries to do is to convince judge and jury that his or here specific interpretation is the only true one. Most scientists try to do the same, but many of them are not aware, or refuse to be aware, that there are many more theories than the one they cherish. Most religious leaders are still very shortsighted in this respect -- usually because of vested interests! YR teaches you to create new and useful mappings according to your needs. YR does not condemns the material side, but it is fully aware of the importance of that which becomes conscious to us, and it is ready to enjoy the gifts of consciousness-matter, and to fulfill our wishes. Many Rune students of the past stumbled over the typically male-chauvinist content of the last stanzas of the magical poem, not realizing the deeper meaning in it. Their male chauvinism paralleled their denial of that which is \"dirty matter,\" not realizing that this was a denial ultimately of that which is consciously perceived. The last three Runes are a special threshold to an initiation process which requires a tuning into what matter really means to us. The stanzas can bring a contact with those ideas on a subtle, subconscious level. Rune Masters who know history have not so much been caught by the entrapment of the the last three stanzas. They knew that the time when the present Runic lore was created was much less patriarchalistic than what the stanzas indicate. In fact, there have been just as many female shamans as there were male 114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"lesson06 ones. Realizing that discrepancy, they immediately looked for the more hidden meanings in the stanzas, realizing that if this important step of balancing was not made, the resulting imbalance would jeopardize the path of the aspiring Rune Master. Shape Related Energies Being the Rune of conscious perception, of the Norns, it is natural to tune more into the concept of shape vibrations. When we use this term, we are naturally thinking of the shapes that are the geometric outline of the Runes. Next, the body positions. What other shapes? Mantras are shapes, too, so are sounds, or plain colors or combination of colors, feelings in the body, taste, smells, etc. The Rune Master is increasingly capable to correlate all those shapes, in order to be capable of effectively working with Runic energies, to differentiate between Runes and various shades of Runes, and to apply them in the most effective way possible. What we do here is to give you some ideas of how to practice shape vibrations in order to get the right feeling, or visions, of Runes, and how to project your desires or wishes whenever you practice shape vibrations. The following gives important hints. You will combine more and more as you progress. 1. The Rune MAN: Stand in the position of MAN, be conscious of the Runic streams entering your body through your left hand and leaving the body through the right hand. 2. The Rune YR: Stand in position of YR, do the same. In both cases, wait for specific visions, feelings, etc., write them in your magical diary. 3. (Works best in a group of Rune students) Sit down and establish the inner and outer Rune Realms. Next, chant mantras of the Runes continuously for at least five minutes. Ideally more. From time to time, while chanting, stand up, get into the body position of the Rune, and keep chanting. Compare with other participants and share experiences. 3a. As a variation, while chanting (for at least 5 minutes), consciously draw the energies of the Rune chanted: hand position of the Rune and draw Rune energies through the hand(s). With other hand (if free), ideally with a power rod or in your imagination, project the Runic energy in the middle of your circle. If you practice by yourself, in the middle of the Rune circle which you laid out on the altar. While chanting, become ONE not only with the Rune, but with the shape vibrations of the sound. 4. Extend the chanting, ideally with a group, up to 15 minutes. Include your special wish in the chant. Expect the Runes to set in motion whatever is needed to achieve your goal(s). 5. Set up a ceremonial (as described in the preceding letter), and have a chant of 15 to 20 minutes precede the meditation part. 6. Practice deviations of the Rune mantras (see letter of IS). 7. Practice Rune body positions while lying on the floor. Include chanting. Include your wish. 115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"lesson06 PRACTICE, THE RUNE Y R 1. Copy the Song of YR in your book of ceremonials. 2. Murmur the Song of YR regularly, once everyday or once every other day. 3. Practice as described above, at least three Runes of your choice. 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"lesson06 Letter of Instructions # 17 The Rune EH by Karl Hans Welz EH is another Rune that can be quite difficult to understand when practiced the first time around. The superficial meaning is too easy. The beginner tends to stumble over this easiness and thinks that this is all there is to EH. EH refers to \"marriage,\" and, esoterically speaking, to cosmic union. Perhaps, let's look at the shape vibration of the body position. NOD has the right hand up, and the left one down. EH draws from \"above\" and directs to \"below,\" while NOD draws from \"below\" and directs to \"above.\" While NOD teaches us to use karma for spiritual goals, EH uses the realm of the spirit to work on karma. The person who mastered EH and NOD needs no longer be exposed to blind karma. EH and NOD again join into HAGAL, the world crystal, just the same way as MAN and YR do. Therefore, the combination of EH and NOD defines the world-crystal for the individual. There is something more exciting to EH: Take KA, the sixth Rune of the king magician (Knight at the first level) and AR, Rune of the Solar spirit (Solar Christ), ARAHARI: These two Runes combine to EH. We need to be capable of working with consciousness-matter so that we can overcome karmic need. We also need to be aware of cosmic union. An old Greek myth says that at some time man became so powerful a being that the gods were afraid of being dethroned. So they decided to split man into two sexes, which, since then, expend most of their energy in finding each other. Consequently the gods were safe again. Here you find the myth of the sister soul, soul twins, etc. Meditate on KA and AR becoming EH, then EH and NOD becoming HAGAL! It is very important for the student to read between the lines. This is so because in the three last Runes you will find much material that can be said to the person who practiced and advanced well, but which should not come across to the person who could not reach yet the appropriate level. 117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"lesson06 Most of those who came to this point have practiced Runes in their past lives, and they are likely to use Runes responsibly to overcome their karmic restrictions. They are reaching a point, from which they are aware of karmic structuring, and they act accordingly. Doubts have ceded to exist in many respects. YR makes good use of that which becomes conscious: It maps it, forms useful theories, and uses those mappings to advance to the level of god-man. Going back to the myth that I have mentioned before: The gods feared the human being that used his/her full potential. An evolved human being knows that there is no need to worship energetic patterns. So they “made the split into two sexes.” This means nothing more and nothing less than that the gods polarized human beings and thus controlled human sexuality. Control of sexuality entails frustration, chronic sexual spasms and unhealthy sexual expression. This then can easily be directed into insecurity and worship of gaseous mammals above the clouds and invisible playmates! In its most unhygienic expression, natural sexual ecstasy finds its “ersatz” in religious ecstasy. I say unhygienic, because religious ecstasy brings excitement (most of the time not perceived as what it is -- a cheap surrogate with strong sexual overtones), but no release. EH combines, re-combines, the spiritual with the material-conscious. Idea (in the meaning which Plato gave it) becomes ONE with perception, without being a fallacious identity (words are NOT the things they describe). Again, while the stanza may point toward the re-unification of the two principles of man and woman in a mystical wedding, which can be performed at any interval in space-time desired, there is some meaning embedded which at first communicates itself sub-consciously. It is more a transcending of the attitude that considers unhealthy sexual relations being “God-given’” or, worse, “natural.” EH relates to the hermaphrodite in the Tarot-deck (\"the world\") where the cosmic union of male and female principles within the individual is perfected. GIBOR, as we will experience, transcends \"the world\" of the cabalist and brings in the pantheistic notion (god-universe) unknown to most cabalists. To experience the realms of EH, it will be useful to meditate on EH, and to chant the Rune. This practice is good in a group. It is even better when practiced by a couple. As you come closer to being a Rune Master, it becomes more important to have group support. Since most of those who are our students either are leaders of groups (other than Runes) or are to become such leaders (not necessarily Runes), I strongly urge you to not only let people know of true unfettered love, but also to further it by all available means. EH brings the bonding of spirit-consciousness in true cosmic union. Now, I am including two very important rituals, which you can act out either in an esoteric way or in an exoteric way: These rituals are the magical calling of the \"YOU\" and the ritual of Gnostic wedding. You may perform these rituals to connect with the sister soul and to wed with the sister soul or to unify spirit and consciousness-matter. The attentive student will find additional suggestions between the lines, and may shape the ceremonials accordingly. Both rituals have strong sex-magical background. MAGICAL CALLING OF THE \"YOU\" 1. Set up your Rune staves in a circle. Ideally crystals.

After initiation Gibor leads to a new cycle. This initiation of GIBOR to be a Rune Master, of Baron of the Knights of Runes, brings you in touch with the Runic symbolism as a whole. If, after this initiation, you pass through the eighteen Runes again, then you will do so in awareness of the symbolism as a whole. New revelations will then follow, a better understanding, and still more powerful uses that you may apply responsibly. GIBOR allows you to be ONE with the universe, ONE with the realms of creation. If you understand the hidden meanings of the Runes YR, NOD, and EH, GIBOR will reveal itself to you. The initiation to be a Rune Master will open you up to many new insights. With this initiation you will receive the keys to many new and powerful practices. After you have become a Rune Master, it will be important that you help others with your Runic knowledge. I do suggest that you begin to build your own power base. This means that you should form a Runic castle, i.e., a group of persons who are dedicated to study Runes. This is so because group practices can help you develop much stronger energies than practice by yourself would do. Group practice can also turn out to be a significant factor in your further advancement in your Runic work. As your students ask you about Runic practice, you will find yourself drawing answers and knowledge from realms that you were not aware existed. Consequently your power over Runic realms increases, your skills become more proficient, and your path becomes easier to follow. In brief, you will bring your life more and more under your own control. The Initiation This letter of instruction concerns itself in the main with your initiation. Since this is a correspondence course, I am going to prepare you for a self initiation. If you do have the opportunity to be initiated by a 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"lesson06 Rune Master of the Knights of Runes, you should do so. If you have formed a castle, you can share the ceremony of your own initiation with members of the castle. Persons who practiced the eighteen lessons jointly may perform a joint initiation. In this case it is important that they join their outer as well as their inner Rune realms. In the following I am giving suggestions of how you set up your Rune realm for the initiation. If you followed well the lessons, You are aware, of course, that you may set up your realm following your own preferences. Items needed for an Initiation 1. An altar, preferably with an altar cloth. The cloth may be either black or white. A clean table may serve as an altar. 2. Rune staves. Your personal set may form a circle on the altar. Crystal staves with a center crystal are very good for your initiation. 3. An incense burner with Runic incense. Frankincense is a god substitute. 4. A power rod or dagger. 5. A Hammer of Thor. It is good if this hammer has your personal Runes inscribed. 6. A cup or chalice with water or wine. 7. Candles. You may use eighteen candles, each of which has one of the Runes inscribed. 8. A robe. You may also practice nude. Preparations Do these preparations up to three days before you practice the ceremonial of initiation. 1. Bless the power rod (or dagger): Hold your hands above the power rod, chant one Rune after the other, and project the energy of each Rune into the power rod. 2. Bless the water or wine. Use your power rod and project with it energy into the water or wine. Chant all Runes, one after the other, and project their energies into the water or wine. 3. Bless the incense. Do this the same way as you did the water and power rod. 4. Charge the Hammer of Thor, again the same way, by projecting each of the eighteen Runes into it. 5. Lastly, bless each of the eighteen candles, one by one, by projecting the corresponding Rune into it. The Ceremonial Immediate preparation 1. Write date of ceremonial and outline of it into your magical diary. 2. Cleanse yourself in some form of ritual bath. 3. Put on your robe. Some followers of the old religion prefer to practice nude. 4. Set up the outer Rune realm, altar, etc. 5. Imagine a sphere around the whole operation. Charge the sphere, focussing on protection. 124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"lesson06 Initiation to Rune Master Introduction: 1. Tune into inner Rune realm 2.
