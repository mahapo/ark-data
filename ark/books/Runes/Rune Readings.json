Published by Magitech Press P.O. Box 1298, Woodstock, GA 30188 RUNE READINGS A Correspondence Course - Lesson I By Karl Hans Welz - Grand Rune Master - The Knights of Runes About Runes Since ancient times Rune readings have played an important role in Northern European cultures. In his book \"germania\" Tacitus, a Roman historian who lives some 2000 years ago, describes the casting of Runes as it was practiced by the Teutonic peoples. The oldest known runic inscription dates from approximately the same time. It is on an Alaman or Suebic helmet. On it a name is inscribed, probably of the owner of the helmet: The inscription on this helmet reads from the right to the left: HARIGASTI(Z)TEIWA (WULF) IL(A). Both, the Alamans and the Suebes were German tribes. The helmet was found in the last century near Graz, Austria. It was dated to the years 6-9 c.e. (common era). The Germanic runes are essentially different from the ancient Greek and Roman alphabets. Runes have not been used on an everyday basis to write down trivial things. They served religious-cultic purposes and magic. Their magical power has been fully mastered only by a few Rune Masters. The Germanic peoples did not have a script for everyday usage. Knowledge of the Runes was reserved to a few people. It is also very likely that these sacred symbols were not a spontaneous invention by one person alone. They seemed to 1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 1 have evolved slowly and through many different alphabets. The origins of the Runes is somewhat shrouded in mystery. The oldest Runic alphabets have been found in the Alpine region South of the main ridge. We know that the Greek alphabet was derived from the Phoenician one. The alphabets that were used in the Italian peninsula have evolved from the Greek alphabet. Among these alphabets was the Etruscan alphabet. The Etruscan empire flourished in today's Tuscany, North of Rome. During a Keltic invasion at about 400 b.c.e. many Etruscans fled North into the Alpine region where the Illyrians had taken a foothold. Both, the Etruscans and Illyrians were kin to today's Albanians. Soon the Illyrian tribes developed their own alphabets from the Etruscan alphabet. They used it for magical purposes. From the Illyrians the Runic alphabets spread to the Germanic tribes. Caesar wrote that the Suebic people, whose duke, Ariovist, he defeated, used the Runes for divination. From the Alpine regions the Runes spread into Northern Europe and Scandinavia. The Vikings of Scandinavia were the last people who had Runes incorporated in their religious system. In the German realm, the Catholic church destroyed much of the Runic tradition and wisdom. From that point on the Runic tradition had to be transmitted in secrecy. With the invasion of Christianity in Scandinavia, the practice of Runic wisdom suffered setbacks similar to those in the German realm. However, some of the high ranking members of the church became Rune Masters themselves. consequently the Runes could survive and with them some of the ancient mythology. I want to mention here that a great deal of the Norse (Viking) mythology goes back to real historical events that actually happened in the Alaman, Frank, and Suebi realms of Southern Germany. About Rune Readings In the past years Runes have been increasingly used as tools for divination, readings, and advice. Of course people who cast Runes are no longer doing this to find out the will of the gods. Some neo-odinist circles may be an exception to that. Runes are an excellent tool to find advice, to help in spiritual evaluation, and to help in personal growth. They help you know the trends of your future. Knowing these trends will help you in your decision making processes. Then, once you decided for a course of action that is based on a Rune reading, you can use Runes again to find out the outcome of your decision. Of course, you can significantly increase your powers of ESP, including rune readings, 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 1 when using a Welz Chi Generator for that purpose.

Many successful people reached their positions because they gained insight in future trends and acted accordingly. Managing trends of the future is still better than just knowing them! The Runes can be a significant help to manage your trends, especially when you boost them with a Welz Chi Generator! This is so, because the use of Runes goes much beyond giving readings. Runes are a system of creative energies. You can use these energies to find out about trends and you can use them to make trends or manage trends. This way, Runes help you to have influence on your future. You may use Runes to change negative trends, even to eliminate them. Conversely you can use Runes to enhance positive trends of destiny. You find these techniques in the Basic Rune Course. this is a course of eighteen lessons that culminates in your initiation to being a Rune Master. If you want to decisively influence your destiny, you should get this course now! The present course has the purpose to give you a comprehensive introduction into Rune readings. The methods that I am going to show you in the following lessons are based on the most powerful Runic symbolism of our days: The symbolism of the Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes. The following lessons will provide you with a no nonsense approach that will allow you to practice Rune readings within a relatively short time. The instructions are easy to follow by anyone who is willing to invest some time into Runic practice. Repeated practice will rapidly develop your skills as a Rune reader. You may gain certification as a Rune reader if you enroll in the Basic Rune Course and advance to the eighteenth lesson. More About Runes Runes are an ancient system of psychic practice that was last incorporated in the religious systems of the European North. This system was based on a set of sacred symbols that were referred to as Runes. In the old Germanic languages the word \"runa\" referred to a special kind of murmur. It was the murmuring of nature. Nature gives humans \"murmured\" messages in a language that is not words. Nature tells something on the creative levels of experience. The shaman, priest, or visionary knows what nature tells him or her, but again, cannot translate it exactly into words of everyday usage. This murmuring is more like the conveying of creative ideas. Neither action nor feelings of this murmuring can be defined 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 1 in words of language. Language is too well-defined for such communication. In his translation of the Bible into Gothic language, the bishop Wulfila used the Gothic word \"runa\" whenever he translated the word \"mystery.\" The use of this mysterious word alone caused a tremendous impact of this translation upon the Gothic people who understand \"runa\" on a much deeper level than the original texts of the Bible were conveying! The Runes have always been perceived as sacred symbols rather than as an alphabet. In fact, several sounds of the ancient Viking language are not even represented in the Runic alphabet. This fact by itself rendered the writing of language in Runic symbols to being a rather clumsy affair. Runes represent energies from the realms of creation. Because of this characteristic, Runes are well suited for the making of very powerful talismans as well as for other powerful magical practices. Being creative energies, Runes are extremely flexible. The best approach is by means of \"natural murmur of the creative experience!\" Practice with the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes will teach you how to do that. We cannot describe it! The Sacred Futhork is the most powerful Runic system in use. This is so because this runic system connects with the basic creative structures of the universe. These structures are the building blocks of the universe, so to say. On a material level these building blocks are the chemical elements. The system of the chemical elements is founded on the number 18, the number of the Sacred Futhork! The 18 also connects with the natural zodiac and with the structure of the world crystal. The creative force of the enneagram comes to its peak in the connection with the 2 x 9 Runes! Each of the eighteen Sacred Futhork runes represents a set of creative energies with which you can get in contact and draw from. In the first and second lessons of this course you will learn key words for each Rune that serve you to get in contact with their powers! For your success as a Rune reader it is imperative that you know well how to connect with the creative energies of each Rune. You need to know how to draw and project Runic energies. With a bit of practice you will learn to establish your Rune realms. Establishing your rune realms is an essential practice for successful Runic work, including readings! Much of what I have laid out here may seem difficult at first. However, the purpose of this course is to make the learning for you as easy as possible. If you follow the instructions given in this course and do a minimal amount of practical work, you are likely to give good Rune readings in a couple of weeks. If you acquire some of the additional material that is designed to simplify your learning, then you can reach your goal in a considerably shorter period of time. Each Rune is represented by a graphical symbol. The Eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes are, in their outline, or graphic representation, derived from the Hexagon with the three 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 1 inscribed diameters. This figure is often referred to as THE WORLD CRYSTAL. The eighteen, number of the Runes, becomes apparent! Every Rune connects with worlds of creation and formation. The Rune Poem is part of this ancient tradition. It appears in the Edda, an Icelandic collection of songs and mythology. This poem has one stanza for each Rune. In each of these stanzas, there are hidden meanings of the Rune. Some persons dwell on the outer appearance of the stanzas, and miss their inner meaning. For instance, some people show a delight in expressing their disgust concerning the \"male chauvinist\" content of some stanzas, all the while they miss a deeper understanding of the interplay between Light energies and Life energies that is symbolized in those stanzas. Their narrow minds prevented them from penetrating deepest mysteries. FA I know the Songs that no wise one knows And none of the human children The first Song is HELP, and help it will Against sorrow, hurt, and any distress. UR A second I know; quite useful to all people Who practice the healing hand: It chases disease and all pain, It cures hurts and all wounds. THORN A third Song I know: If urgency tells me to tie the opponent with magic Then I dullen the steel of my foes So that their swords will not cut anymore.

Mantra: t-t-t-t-tyyyyyyrrrrr Some Preconditions For you to be successful in Rune readings, you need to become familiar with some basic methods of Runic practice. In this lesson, I am going to introduce you to two very important things: The book of ceremonials, and the establishing of your Rune realms. The Book of Ceremonials The book of ceremonials is a very important tool for your Runic practice in general and for Rune readings in particular. True, our times have the advantage of tapes, computers, and printed books. Yet nothing compares to your own, handwritten, documentation that your book of ceremonials will be. There is a high symbolic significance to your setting up such a book: It is a significance that reaches well beyond simply writing down those things that you want to remember. The book of ceremonials is your own sacred book, written by yourself, and only for your own use. It contains spiritual energies which you -- consciously or not -- project into this book whenever you are writing in it and whenever you use it. Time will teach you the immense value of this book. Be aware that repeated use of a ceremonial utensil ties up energies in this utensil. These energies will then be present later when needed. All it takes is the presence of the utensil. Consequently you can then consciously focus on other things. You should consider your book of ceremonials as such a utensil. To set up your book of ceremonials, you buy a nice looking notebook. First, you copy in it the \"Runic Poem,\" which contains the key-triggers for the eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes. As you continue in your Runic practice, you write in your book of ceremonials the various rituals, methods, practices, and ceremonials with Runes. True, copying takes its time, but this rather small investment in your time will bear hundred fold fruit. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Rune Readings Course Lesson 2 While copying, be aware that you are writing symbolic language. You will experience the symbolic meaning communicating itself to you with this practice of the Runes. As you continue you will penetrate the depths of the symbolic language. This will help you to increasingly gain an understanding of the hidden meanings of the poems and songs that you never may have thought to be possible. How to Write your Book of Ceremonials For your best benefit, and for best results, you should do the copying or writing in your book of ceremonials in an environment that is optimal for this process. It should be an environment that is quiet and free from outside interference. Remember, more is going on when you write in your book of ceremonials than mere copying! Therefore, make sure that nothing will disturb you in this very important work, and arrange your whole set-up in a ceremonial-like manner. Before you begin to copy, set up your EPG (Welz Chi Generator) and transfer to yourself. Set it onto an alpha frequency. This will bring you into a calm state of meditation. See yourself in your inner Rune Realm. Continue to focus your whole, undivided attention on the process of writing. Visualize and feel energy flow through your hand and pen into the letters and words that you write on paper. See and feel every word that you write fill up with spiritual energy and radiating with Light and life energies. If you cannot yet focus your undivided attention to your writing, do not get unnecessarily worried. Practice will be your best teacher, and repeated use of the Book of Ceremonials, as you do when murmuring the Rune Songs, will fill it with strong spiritual energies. (You can also practice without the EPG, of course) If you proceed as instructed, your book of ceremonials will be a powerful talisman. It connects you with the Runic Realms of Creation whenever you use it for a Runic ceremony, or reading. There is a great significance in your writing your own book of ceremonials that goes much beyond that which you may comprehend at present. The Rune Realms Before you begin to practice Runes, you need to establish within yourself a space in which you can work. It will also be useful to have some symbolic arrangement outside, which you can use to draw and to project Runic energies. The arrangement outside is your OUTER RUNE REALM. The inner workspace that you establish is your INNER RUNE REALM, and the Realm from which you draw the Runic 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Rune Readings Course Lesson 2 energies is the RUNE REALM OF CREATION. With your imagination, you connect those three Rune Realms. At a later point, when your capability of visualization will be sufficiently advanced, you may see the three Rune realms connected with the axis of the (multidimensional) world tree, where the distance from each Rune Realm to every other is equal. You will also become aware that the inner Rune Realm is not completely inside yourself, as little as the outer Rune Realm is completely outside. The three Realms permeate each other. With your practice, the mutual contact of the three Rune Realms increases continuously, and so will your capability to harness the energies of the Runes. The Outer Rune Realm You create your outer Rune Realm best with some utensils. As a future Rune Master, you need to be aware that repeated use of the same utensil allows you to set up structures of higher order energies (HOE) without the need of using your own energies. This practice frees your conscious mind for that which is most important in your action. Ceremonial utensils compare to machines on the material planes. They can be regarded as machines that have effects that reach into planes beyond the material levels. Those utensils are focal points. Needless to say, the best utensil is of such symbolic arrangement that it can be a focal point for any desired energy of a specific symbolism. A very strong set of utensils is the symbols of the four elements. These symbols appear in three ways at least. First, they symbolize the four elements on the material planes. Second, they symbolize the four elements on all other planes. Third, they represent the four planes on which the Operator acts. We suggest, that you use the following set of utensils that symbolizes the elements. Use candles for fire, or the world of emanation and your will. Use a cup with water or wine to symbolize your emotions, the water element, and the astral world. Choose a dagger (active) and incense (passive) for the air element, your mind, and the mental spheres. Finally, use a dish with earth, bread, or a coin or special talisman such as the Hammer of Thor for the earth element, matter, your consciousness, and the material planes upon which you want to act. Be aware of the old wisdom that, when you align the four elements, you can perform anything you want to perform. In some way this is like having will, mind, emotions, and consciousness directed at one and the same goal. You can achieve this with proper direction of the will power, control of thoughts, concentration of emotions, and conscious attitude. NOTE: An excellent help for you to align the four elements and reach Oneness with the Divine is the COURSE IN COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS by Karl Hans Welz. You may order this course from: HSCTI, P.O. Box 666 033, Marietta, GA 30066. Course Fee: $24.00 The next, very important feature is a utensil, so to say, that brings about protection. The CIRCLE is ideal for this purpose. However, for it to be very effective, your imagination needs to go beyond the mere circle that you draw or project. You need to 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Rune Readings Course Lesson 2 envision a bubble at least. The circle symbolizes your duniverse, of which you are the Divine principle in the act of creation: You rule all energies in this universe. Now let's talk about the symbolism that gives you access to the energies with which you want to practice: the Runic symbolism. You arrange one set of RUNE STAVES (you need another set for the reading) in a circle around you. You begin with FA in the North, going counterclockwise until GIBOR. If you intend a specific Runic practice, then you will do well to have the Rune(s) involved in front of you, taken out of the context of the circle. This symbolically brings you in touch with the specific Rune(s). It is important that you either make or get your set of Rune staves soon. You may use a set of rituals (a ritual is a part of a ceremonial) to establish your outer Rune Realm. In later lessons, you will learn those specific rituals. Here we mention that such rituals include lighting of candles, charging of the elements, lighting of the incense, establishing of the protection, etc., including rules of purification of the practitioner and other participants. The Inner Rune Realm Once the outer Rune Realm is established, you continue to establish the inner Rune Realm. You may, of course, establish the inner Rune Realm only. To establish the outer realm you may project the Runes mentally into the space around yourself. However, the effect of this technique will be in the main on the mental planes, unless you are very well advanced. For the sole purpose of training in establishing the inner Rune Realm, of course, you need not establish the outer Rune Realm. This counts also for Rune meditations and for murmuring of a Rune Song. However, it is always useful to have at least on candle burning as a focal point: a \"miniature outer Rune realm,\" so to say. For anything where you expect effects on the astral emotional, conscious or material planes, you will do well to set up the outer Rune Realm. All too often students complain that they can not get spectacular results. Failures of this kind may be for karmic reasons. In most cases, however, it is failure to properly establish the outer Rune Realm. The inner Rune Realm takes shape of your visualization. You build up a space within yourself that is your working space. In this space you imagine yourself working with Runes. You know of the connection of both Rune Realms with the Realms of creation. To establish this working space, your inner Rune Realm, to its most effective shape, you need to practice a bit. You need to train yourself to a point where you can establish this inner Rune Realm spontaneously, at any time. This capability, or course, will in most cases not be learned spontaneously. To establish your inner Rune Realm, you proceed as follows: 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Rune Readings Course Lesson 2 1. Set up your EPG and transfer the energy to yourself. Set an alpha frequency. 2. Bring yourself in a comfortable position. If you do more than practice, establish some symbolism of your outer Rune Realm. 3. Relax your body. You may use progressive relaxation, beginning from the tips of the toes and progressively relaxing up to the crown of your head. 4. Imagine yourself being in a place that you consider to be appropriate for establishing your Inner Rune Realm. You may imagine that you are in a clearing in the woods, which is very peaceful, with a brook running through, on a very sunny day. You may see yourself on a quiet beach, or on the top of a mountain, or in an old temple. Visualize whatever situation suits you, and whatever place you can imagine as being a holy place. The place that you are to establish now is the place from which you are triggering and harnessing the Runic energies. This place is your place of power. You are ruler in this place, master of your universe. For your convenience, and for easier access to the inner Rune Realm, a tape is available. You see yourself in the middle of this space, your inner Rune Realm, and you see yourself fully protected. This protection also reaches out in your outer Rune Realm. It connects with the protective measure(s) of your outer Rune Realm. Then, you see a circle of Runes around you. Those Runes may be giant Rune stones, or wooden staves arranged around you, similar to the arrangement you would have in your outer Rune Realm. Again, the arrangement may be the 16 Runes from FA through YR around you, beginning with FA in the North, in front of you, going counterclockwise, until you reach YR again in the North. The Rune EH to you left, and GIBOR to your right. You may also visualize an altar in front of you, similar to an altar that you may have in your outer Rune Realm. Now, you see every one of the Runes around you in a glowing light, indicating that they get their charge from the Rune Realm of creation. At the same time, if your outer Rune Realm is established, this outer Rune Realm is automatically charged, and the connection to the Rune Realm of creation is established. As the Rune Master of this universe, you are aware that you are its absolute ruler. Having established your inner Rune Realm, you may operate from there on a purely mental level. If your outer Rune Realm is also established, then you may keep the awareness of your inner Rune Realm being present, and you can now begin with the Rune rituals or ceremonials. Practice of the inner Rune Realm is necessary for good progress in Runic practice, and for your advancement toward being a Rune Master. 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Rune Readings Course Lesson 3 RUNE READINGS A Correspondence Course - Lesson III By Karl Hans Welz - Grand Rune Master - The Knights of Rune Access Keywords, Meanings, Correlations of Runes The Rune BAR Rune of revelation, Rune of birth of the spirit.

Mantra: ggiiibbboooorrrr More Basics: General Energetic Principles In the following, I am giving you insights in the structures and working of the universe. What is of importance here is the USEFULNESS of those insights in relation to what you are doing, namely giving Rune readings. I do not claim that the descriptions of the structures of the universe are the only true ones. However, you will find that these descriptions will prove to be useful when you are receiving insights during a Rune reading. Universal Structures: The Elements Perhaps the most familiar universal structure with which any psychic, or reader, is working are the four elements: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. In our days, the term \"element\" is somewhat misleading for the beginner. This is so, because when we hear this word, our attention is immediately drawn to the chemical elements. The chemical elements are part of a completely different ball game. In our days, it may be more useful to use the work \"principles\" rather than \"elements.\". However, I decided to keep in line with tradition and use the word \"element.\" Those four principles, or elements, 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Rune Readings Course Lesson 3 reflect a set of basic experiences that we have. We can regard the elements as undefined terms. The meanings of undefined terms are encompassing many things. This allows for a great flexibility of those terms. At first, I am simply giving things, or experiences, or structures, which relate to the various elements. FIRE: Anything fiery. The human will. The \"world of emanation,\" or \"spiritual sphere\" (more about this below). Physical fire. Hot spices (experienced as \"fire\" when ingested). Anger, \"hot\" temper. Fever. The qualities of fire: HOT (positive polarity) and DRY (electric energy -- more about this later). The TRIANGLE. WATER: Anything watery. The human emotions, the astral sphere, world of formation. Physical water, all liquids. COLD (negative polarity) and HUMID (magnetic energy). The PENTAGON. AIR: Anything airy. Physical air, gases. The mental sphere, world of creation. The human mind. HOT (positive polarity) and HUMID (magnetic energy). The SQUARE. EARTH: Anything earthy. Physical earth, solid materials. The human consciousness. COLD (negative polarity) and DRY (electric energy). The PENTAGRAM. The quality HOT is active The quality COLD is passive The quality DRY is LIGHT (electric) The quality HUMID is LIFE (magnetic) With the qualities the same holds true as with the elements. They are to be considered as undefined terms, the meanings of which are encompassing many things. This allows for a great flexibility of those terms. The elements are related to the various levels of existence. Earth, or consciousness has relation to the physical, or material planes. That which is \"tangible\" naturally is conscious. That which is conscious manifests. In fact, even when you get in touch with one of the \"higher spheres,\" you necessarily get in touch with that which becomes conscious. The physical plane is often considered to be the \"lowest,\" or \"most dense\" plane. I suggest that you do not fully accept this point of view. In fact, matter as it is perceived changes constantly. It is in continuous flux as is consciousness. Perceiving the material sphere as \"low, rigid,\" or \"dense\" may rob you of very important methods. It is useful to perceive the material plane in two \"layers\": One is tangible material (the \"lower\" material plane), and the other is of an energetic characteristic: electric and magnetic. This plane is sometimes called the \"etheric plane.\" There, the electric manifestation is the electromagnetic spectrum (light), which permeates everything in one form or another, from gamma -- and x-rays to visible light to the radio frequencies. The magnetic manifestation is the life energy that permeates everything. Throughout the ages, this life energy has received many different names. For our purposes, we use the word \"Orgone.\" This word was introduced by Wilhelm Reich. We may also use the word \"animal magnetism,\" which was introduced by Franz Anton Mesmer. Study the course \"magic of the future\" to learn working with orgone energy. Diagrams of the levels, energies, etc. are shown below. PLANE HUMAN CORRELATING EXPRESSION ELEMENT Spiritual Will Fire Mental Mind Air Astral Emotion Water Material Consciousness Earth Some More Basics Giving Rune readings is rooted in a process of visualization, tuning into the Runic energies, and intuitive interpretation. More advanced readings involve the practice of specific ceremonials. Both practices require basic meditation skills from which you can then go on to skills of focusing, visualizing, and projecting energies. I have mentioned before that the use of an EPG (Welz Chi Generator) will enhance considerably your 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Rune Readings Course Lesson 3 meditative skills, focus, and eventually projection of energies as in ESP and astral travel. Meditation as we practice it here is the ability to calm the body and the mind. Later, you will learn to concentrate on a given subject, to see certain things with your inner eye, and to keep your focus on one and the same object for a while. You will acquire those skills step by step. For those of you who are already familiar with those practices, I still suggest that you follow them so that you can tune yourself in the specific purposes of making talismans. Of course, you need then not practice as long as a pure beginner would need. Find yourself a quiet spot where you are unlikely to be disturbed. Set up your EPG, if you have one, and transfer the life force to yourself. Start out by sitting quietly. Be aware of the many functions of your body that usually escape your attention. The air flowing in the lungs, your heart beat, some tingling on the skin, and much more. Focusing on your body helps you block out the many thoughts that chase each other during the normal course of your day by day activities. Once you know that you are calm, you may begin to practice with Runic mantras. Chant mentally \"FA\" while inhaling. While exhaling, let the energies of FA: flow into your body and extend into your aura. Do the same with other Runes. Write down your insights, feelings, visions, etc., which come as a result of this practice. What this practice will do for you is teaching you how to manipulate psychic (in our case: Runic) energies. Continue by concentrating of Runes: Draw the Rune you want to concentrate of (such as FA) on a piece of paper. Although you know by now the meanings of the Rune, you do not think about those meanings. Simply look at the Rune you have drawn. While looking, chant the mantra of the Rune (FA, in our case) while inhaling, chant the mantra mentally while exhaling. Close your eyes. Continue the mental chanting. At the same time, visualize FA with the eye of your mind, or inner eye. Hold the picture of the Rune with your inner eye as long as you can. Be aware of the other experiences, visions, insights, etc., which the Rune brings to you. Once you can hold the image of the Rune for three to five minutes, you are ready to go on to your first Rune reading. 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 4 RUNE READINGS A Correspondence Course - Lesson IV By Karl Hans Welz - Grand Rune Master - The Knights of Rune About Rune Readings Most people who know about Runes think immediately of readings, when hearing about them. There is no doubt that Rune readings are the best known application of Runic practice. Many metaphysical books concerning Runes are devoted almost entirely to Rune readings. In fact, some recent books are concerned with no other aspect of Runes at all. The type of readings dealt with in these books is usually very materialistic, or what could be best described as worldly. When this kind of reading is the goal, it is of little importance that the Runes used constitute a symbolism rather than an array of symbols. Indeed, almost any set of symbols that describe life situations would suffice. Since this is so, a word of advice is called for. The 18 Sacred Futhork Runes are operating on the levels of the realms of creation. The symbolism of the Sacred Futhork does not lend itself easily to merely worldly readings. When you eventually perform Rune readings with the help of the Sacred Futhork, you should not forget what seem to be statements about worldly situations are coming in fact from deeper, and more spiritual realms, the realms of creation eternal. Rune readings, when properly performed, are a voice from the realms of creation. Hence the need to be familiar with some aspects of Runic practice before you are ready to perform a Rune reading. You must be capable at least of properly establishing your Rune realms as learned in the second lesson. Rune readings tell you of the energies from the realms of creation that are at the roots of trends, or events, in the past, present, and future. Rune readings then tell you what energies you may use to deal with the situation effectively. Such a Rune reading emphasizes the spiritual background of everything. The worldly outcome is merely a side effect of a deeper spiritual development. It is never the real crux of the matter. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 4 About Rune Staves Rune staves can be made of many materials. One ancient method of reading the Runes was within the framework of a sacred ritual to explore the will of the gods. In this ritual, the Rune master, sometimes the father of the family, threw little twigs on the ground. In the pattern that was formed from the fallen twigs, the reader then found several Runes showing, which he or she interpreted. Later, twigs were split in two, and Runes were cut on the surface. Therefore, wooden Rune staves were the tradition. Oak and ash seemed to have been the favored trees. In our days a wide variety of materials are used. The material that you use for the staves is totally your choice and preference. Some advanced Rune Masters have several sets of Runes available that are made of different materials. For each Runic practice, they choose one or more sets following their intuition. In the following, I am going to describe some of your possible choices. Wooden Staves Wood is the traditional material for Rune staves. In our days, oak is preferred, because many Rune masters connect oak with Teutonic traditions. Ash, too, is given a high preference. The world tree of the Germanic mythology, Yggdrasil, was thought to be an ash. In general, hardwoods make good Runes. Each Rune connects with one or more specific trees. Rosewood, ebony, and other tropical woods make also excellent sets. You may decide for one set in which each Rune is made of a wood to which you see a correspondence with the Rune. Many experienced Rune Masters have several sets of wooden staves. As you advance in your practice, you may do the following: Collect your own twigs of 1/2 to 3/4 inch's diameter, or branches of 1 1/2 to 2 inches diameter. Then you may intuitively decide which Rune connects best with what twig, or branch. Then, if branches are your choice, cut discs of equal thickness, 3/8/ to 1/2 inches. When working with twigs, cut sections of 2 inches which you split in two. This provides you with nice surfaces on which the Runes may be carved or burned. The sets made available by the Knights of Runes are kits of ash or oak. The staves are measuring 1 1/8 in. X 1 5/8 in. X 3/8 in. The Runes are burned on the staves. You will do the final sanding and polishing of the staves before you go on to charge them. You may also order Rune staves which are already finished. In this case, all you need to do is charge the staves. Crystal Staves Crystals are excellent materials for Runes. As you know already, the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes represent the 18 facets of the World Crystal. The \"ideal\" quartz crystal has 18 facets. If you look at such a crystal from above, you the HAGAL RUNE within the 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 4 HEXAGON. This is the figure from with the Runes are derived. Considering the quality of quartzes, using the crystal in its original shapes is preferable to using the bauble. You may also decide to use other semi precious (or precious) stones for Runes. In this case it is of importance that you consider astrological factors pertaining to your chart in combination with your personal Runes. Consult your Rune Master for advice. The Knights of Runes are offering sets of Rune crystals. Each individual crystal measures between 1 1/4 in. and 2 in. Quartz crystal Runes are universal. They may be used by any person. Rune sets that use a variety of gemstones are custom tailored to the person who is going to use it. They may be special ordered after you have received the appropriate advice from your Rune master. Metal Runes You may special order metal Runes. Those Runes are brass, copper, or silver. Metal runes have very special energies that may be preferred in some situation. Unless you are drawn very much to the idea of having a set of metal Runes, you should prefer wooden staves for the beginning. Rune Cards Rune cards are a fairly recent development. However, they have been around much longer than some people who are bragging about \"being the first ever on the planet who published Rune cards\" would like to be true. Some 35 years ago, a set of Rune cards was included with Karl Spiesberger's book \"Runen Magie\" that was published in 1954. Even an \"expert\" of the somewhat mediocre caliber (as usual) should know that classic. Don Tyson and Llewellyn Publishers are DEFINITELY NOT the first to ever have published a set of Rune cards! Since 1986, the Knights of Runes recommend the use of Rune cards as a TEMPORARY SUBSTITUTE by those who either begin Runic studies or who cannot afford Rune staves. The Rune should be the only thing showing on the card. Drawings of gods, nice looking landscapes, and other \"arteestic\" expressions (kitsch) are severely watering down the connection of the Runes with the Realms of creation. This is so, because Runes are DEFINING and CREATING energies. They are not CREATED and WELL DEFINED energies as is the case with the symbols of the Tarot, where pictures are useful. Pictures of gods, scenarios, and other clutter which is thought to represent Runes is robbing the Rune effectively of its original defining and creative power. The nonsense of drawing pictures could only be perpetrated by \"experts\" who are totally ignorant of the true power of the Runes and their functions as creative and defining energies of the 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 4 universe. Preparing The Staves Do you know how to cut? Do you know how to read? Do you know how to find? Do you know how to explore? Do you know how to demand? Do you know how to celebrate? Do you know how to project? Do you know how to redeem? (from Havamal v. 143) One of the best choices for the beginner is a set of oaken Rune staves which you may order from the Knights of Runes in kit form. The Runes are burnt in the face of these staves. What it needs now is some of your own charging, to make these staves powerful, personal tools to trigger Rune energies. By taking great care to do the finishing work on these staves you will be able to get in tune with each Rune, stave by stave, and end up with a fully charged set. So now you have the staves burned into the wood to start you off, and it is up to you to sand them and polish them and charge them with your own energies. Before you begin on any Rune, read up on the meaning of it. When you are sanding and polishing, be aware of the meaning of the Rune that you are working with. Be also aware that there is much more meaning and significance yet to come, which will open up to you as you progress with your practice and study. Ideally you should do this work in a ceremonial setting. Set your work table, or altar, EPG, and light your candle. You may use the ceremonials outlined in the book \"Runic Ceremonials.\" If this is not possible, get as close as you can to it. With each Rune, you proceed as follows: [Position, or hand position, of IS] Say: Self conscious I am antenna For the rays and vibrations From the Realms of Creation. [Position or hand position, of UR] Say: Self conscious I draw power From the deepest depths 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 4 From the spheres of the Earth From the womb of All Mother. [Position or hand position of MAN] Say: Self conscious I draw power From the highest heights, From the cosmic realms, From the great universe. [Position or hand position of the Rune you are working with] Say: Powers of . . . (Rune name) Come to me Stay with me Give me the wisdom and power Of your Realm! Note: If body or hand positions are not yet known, strongly visualize the Rune with which you are working, in your inner eye. Now you can sand and polish. While doing this, project energy into the Rune. The Runes MAN and YR, KA and AR, FA and OS, need to be notched or otherwise marked at the bottom of the Rune stave, so that you know later which Rune it is. The first step is to sand with a fairly coarse sandpaper, rounding off corners and tidying up. You can go straight to the fine sandpaper from here, or use medium before going on to wool. You can oil the Rune with a good quality oil designed for wood. Some oil polishes and stains require you to steel wool the surface when wet, or soon after drying. Check the label to ensure perfect results. Once the Rune feels good to you, hold the stave in your right hand, look at it and say: You became the carrier of the powers of . . . (Rune name) Tied to you is the power of the Rune. Sing the mantra of the Rune. Murmur the song of the Rune if you are a student of the order, or recite the stanza of the magical poem, if you are not familiar with the Song. Draw the Rune in the air with your dagger, power rod, or wand. Next say: Powers of . . . (Rune name) Thank you for your energy. Flow back to the Realms of Creation Ground by chanting the Rune IS three times while visualizing all surplus energies drain 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 4 in the ground, then go to the next Rune stave. It is best to prepare on stave at a time. This takes a long time, but you will end up with a well charged set of Runes, fully tuned to you; well worth the effort you put into it. If the set of Runes is for the group (castle or lodge), proceed similarly, but have the group present or in mind while preparing the staves. As an alternative, all members of the group can assemble and finish the Runes in a group ceremonial using group energies. In this setting it is permissible for all the members to take part simultaneously, each finishing one Rune at a time, until they are all done. It is important however that group staves are used for group practices only and that individuals' staves are use only by the person to whom they are tuned. The only exception is where a Rune master of Knight uses his or her own personal set for the ceremonials of the castle. Similar provisions apply to the use of Thor's Hammer. Whenever you use the staves, make sure that there is nobody around who may project negative energies or ideas, disbelief, hostility, and so forth, into your Rune staves. Should you suspect, or become aware of too much negative energy building up in your Runes, it will be necessary to de-node, i.e., purify them and then recharge them. Purification: Fumigate in Frankincense, being aware that this action will remove all negative energy. Do this one Rune at time. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 5 RUNE READINGS A Correspondence Course - Lesson V By Karl Hans Welz - Grand Rune Master - The Knights of Rune Divinatory Meanings of the Runes The material that follows must be regarded as a basic alphabet from which you will form sentences. Until all the basic data, i.e., meanings of Runes, is thoroughly known there can be no insights or intuition from an inner manipulation of the meanings here listed. Insights based on a THOROUGH mastery of these basics can with confidence be allowed to enrich the hoard from which you draw your interpretations. The divinatory meanings given here are to be considered as a bare skeleton to be fleshed out by the work and intuitions of the student. It will be good practice to work through the meanings, Rune by Rune. Have the Rune in front of you, read up on the material that follows (the divinatory meanings), then read through the access keywords of the Runes (lesson 1 through 3), and finally read the stanza of the magical poem which relates to the Rune. A practitioner who uses crystals will be astonished at the increase in perceptions brought about by an alliance of the Runes with the crystals. The hexagonal cross section of quartz, and the fact that all of the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes are derived from the geometry of the hexagon is the basis of an enormous increase in crystal power when it is associated with Rune images. To one without any previous knowledge of other systems the Runes will speak clearly and succinctly. There is no limit to the intuitions available to one who reads the Runes with pure motives.

So Rune readings tell you what energies you may use from those realms to deal positively with the situation under examination. As such, Rune readings become a valuable tool for the advanced Rune Master. NEVER use your Rune staves to give purely worldly readings by neglecting what Runes tell you about the deeper, spiritual side of the situation. Before you lay out the staves the introductory ceremony will be very useful. It makes the vibrations right for a successful reading. Proceed as outlined in \"Runic Ceremonials\". Place: Your altar (table), altar of the castle or lodge; best of all set up in a natural setting in a high energy place. Best times: Hours of sunrise, high noon, hour before sunset, midnight. Best days: Wednesday or Sunday, first day of a Runic period (Mal), sacred days, day before the birthday of the person for whom the reading is being done. Direction: Look at the North . . .the location of YR and FA in the altar. Clothing: Robe, or nude. Wear only metal objects that are meaningful, such as the Hammer of Thor, the Great Rune Talisman, dagger, or power rod. Participants: Only those for whom the reading is being done may be present. Diary: It is important to make notes of the operation and the interpretations in your diary, which is the best place for notes that must be of a confidential nature. 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 6 RUNE READINGS A Correspondence Course - Lesson V By Karl Hans Welz - Grand Rune Master - The Knights of Rune The Reading Ceremonial Introduction 1. Setting of the Outer Realm. The outer realm is the physical space in which you are working. It is your temple. The setup of your outer realm symbolizes the universe upon which you intend to operate. Be sure that you will not be disturbed, and make sure that the room in which you are working is clean. The Altar Setup You need an altar. A table will do. Arrange your ceremonial utensils as shown on the previous page. Leave enough space for the candles and Rune staves which you use for the ceremonial. Set a circle of Rune staves around the table. The circle should be large enough for you and the other person(s) present to move around in it. Have the Runes EH and GIBOR on the table as shown. You may have a different Rune or Runes taken from the circle and put on the table, depending on what ceremonial you are performing. At the moment these are general purpose instructions. Set the cup with water, wine, as shown, together with the incense burner, one altar candle, Thor's Hammer, and the Rune dagger or power rod. At this point you are preparing the circle for the reading so the petitioner's candle is not yet positioned as in the diagram. This is where it will be a little later when the reading commences. You should have your book of ceremonials and your diary available. The look of the center of operations will differ, depending what ceremonial you are performing, but the diagram, without the petitioner's candle is a good general purpose arrangement. You may stand, or have a chair available for sitting in front of the table. Now you can set up the space in which you are going to work, your inner and outer Rune realms. First, tune in to each Rune in the circle, singing the stanza of the magical poem for each Rune. As an alternative you may listen to the students' tape that establishes your inner Rune realm, and connect each Rune of your inner Rune realm with the corresponding Rune stave in your outer Rune realm.

First you trace the circle of Rune staves around the table and yourself. After that you draw the HAGAL Rune in all four direction, beginning with the North (the FA Rune in your circle), and going counterclockwise through the West (RIT), South (IS), and then East (BAR). Each time you draw HAGAL in the air do so with the strongest possible image of protection and Oneness with the universe. Put the dagger or rod back at the side of the incense burner. 3.

All around darkness All around night I amidst the Light Darkness has merged With the Light!

Project into the water or wine the success of the reading and the beneficial effect of it on the querent. Know as you do this that the water or wine symbolize emotional strength. Project energy into the water or wine. 6. Look at Thor's Hammer. Be aware that this is the symbol of your capability of drawing, harnessing, and projecting Rune energies. Hold both hands over it, knowing of its power. Imagine it being sent to the realms of destiny, from whence it returns with the knowledge that you seek. Now, you are finished with the preparation and you are ready for the next step, the ceremony of the Rune reading. Ceremony of the Rune Reading The realm of action is the circular area on your altar, as shown on page 2. For the reading you do not place your personal Runes around in the usual circle. You shuffle them, face down, inside the realms of action. Set the petitioner's candle inside the circle, in the Northern direction, as shown in the diagram on page 56. 7. Light the candle of the petitioner, and say: \"This candle represents . . . . . (name of person for whom the reading is to be made), whose trends of destiny the Runes are to show.\" 8. Touch the Hammer of Thor and say: \"I am sending the Hammer of Thor to the Runic realms of Creation. may the Hammer of Thor bring back the wisdom of those realms.\" 9. [Position of UR (hand or body).] Tune to the realm of UR. Sing the mantra of UR (3 or 9 times). Sing the stanza of UR. Then say: \"With the power of UR I am seeing the roots of all fate.\" 10. [Position of MAN] 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 6 Tune into the realm of MAN. Sing the mantra of MAN (3 or 9 times). Sing the stanza of MAN. Then say: \"MAN, symbol of resurrection, Crown of the world tree, Symbol of man I open to the influx of MANA, Of spiritual power Which permeates the universe. Sacred MAN, Reveal the mystery of MIMIR, Awaken within me original memory, Original wisdom. 11. [Position of YR] Tune into the realm of YR. Sing the mantra of YR (3 or 9 times). Sing the stanza of YR. Then say: \"YR, symbol of the roots Symbol of the Norns, Goddesses of destiny, Who spin the threads of destiny At the roots of the world tree. Power of becoming Which permeates The Realms of Creation Bring me in tune with the roots From which life springs Eternally. 12. Drawing the Staves You may now say the question(s) aloud or mentally. Cast all 18 Rune staves onto the altar, while you look at the sky. Still looking at the sky, draw three staves. There are other methods to use five, seven, or nine staves. The first stave tells you about the past, the root, or the beginning of the matter of the question. The second tells about the present, existing, and active now, of the question. The third tells of the outcome, future, or development of the matter of the question, if things are allowed to go on as they now are. 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 6 13. Interpretation Before any attempt of interpretation is made, the data in the previous lesson giving the divination meanings of the Runes should be committed to memory. After this section there is a sample reading and how it was interpreted for the querent. 14. After the Interpretation After the interpretation, you, or the querent, if there is one, drinks the water or the wine. You then end the ceremony by saying: \"Powers of the Runes Thank you for your advice. Flow back to the Realms of Creation.\" 15. Imagine or visualize the Rune energies grounding, flowing into the ground as water flows down a drain, or seeps into sandy soil. 16. Extinguish the flame of the altar candle, incense burner, and petitioner's (querent's) candle, in that order. 17. Remove all utensils. Note: The ceremonial setting gives the reading a very deep, spiritual background, which cannot be achieved as easily by simply drawing Runes from a bag, or in other ways promoted in some of the recent books purporting to teach Rune Reading. It is the decision of the practitioner whether to access knowledge from the realms of creation, that will give insights into how present trends may be developed, or to give psychic fair type reading with all the superficiality of such. The energies present at the proper ceremonial setting give insight on the levels other than the purely verbal. A reading should not be just words, talk about karma, or light entertainment. It should provide a DIRECT EXPERIENCE of the energies and powers that continually shape our destinies. 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 6 Sample Reading This example is taken from an actual reading at which the petitioner asked for counsel in connection with job difficulties. The Runes NOD, IS and FA were drawn, after the preliminary ceremonial that prepared the reader and petitioner for insights of a specific kind. NOD An eighth one is mine: Quite useful to hear For all the people in danger and need. Where hate should arise Between man and man I settle it fast. Be aware that there is karma working at the root of the situation, and it reaches back much further than the difficulties encountered in this lifetime. Use NOD to access this karma. Sing NOD aloud, and invoke NOD, and await what NOD will tell you. At this point, the seeker, who was familiar with Runic ceremonial, has some flashbacks into former lifetimes and situations with some of the same people involved in the present difficulties. From those insights the seeker was capable of developing a basis from which to deal with the situation. NOD gave insight and the power to change. The two- way interaction between the petitioner and the Runes, and the subsequent empowering of the petitioner with a subtle, directed energy that cleared the way to helpful insights, is typical of a Sacred Futhork reading. Mere information and conjecture is more likely in other forms of Rune reading. IS A ninth one I know: If danger is out in the sea: To protect my dear ship I conjure the wind On the billowing floods And I sing into slumber the sea. You are not innocent of what's happening, and NOD has shown you. There is old karma that has to be worked out. How you are dealing with it at the present time is the question to be examined. It seems as though you are constantly getting carried away by irritations that form a nucleus around which your thoughts revolve, thus involving you move emotionally than the actual circumstances warrant. Because your emotions 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Free Rune Readings Course Lesson 6 are tied to the astral level of energies you are projecting these energies into the situation. This is not beneficial to yourself or the other persons concerned. You are in fact adding to this old karma instead of settling it. It is possible for you settle these karmic debts without the other people having to be aware of this. Sing IS aloud and be aware of the energies that are at the roots of your present behaviors. Be aware of your true ego, which has nothing to do with that ego associated with ego trips and illusions. (At this point the seeker became acutely aware of certain behavioral patterns that could modify the situation. He was capable of gaining spiritually on this basis, and discovered a new aspect of IS). FA I know the songs that no wise one knows And none of the children of men. The first song is HELP and help it will Against sorrow, hurt, And any distress. You may not do anything positive you may decide not to learn the lessons from the situation, and still you will receive help on the situation. It's stirring you up at the present, more than it should. The outcome will be positive in any case, since someone will help you. Yet the true message, which helps you solve the karmic problem rather than the present, worldly one, is to use the fires of purification after you become aware of your true ego in relation to the whole matter. Visualize FA. Visualize its purifying fires, and see them reach you in the not too distant future, so that you no longer need depend on outside help. You learned the lesson, you mastered the karma of this situation, and now you are ready to help those who are still in need of your help: those whose hate around NOD. You know now how to help them, being purified yourself. They may be closed to higher wisdom, yet you lay the spark in them, and helpfully project the purifying fires of FA. Now you are no longer exposed to blind fate, or trends. Now YOU are making the trends. Important! After giving the initial meaning, do not hesitate to WORK with the client on the solution of the problem, or situation, until all angles of the problem have been explored, and as many questions as possible have been satisfactorily answered. The 18 Sacred Futhork Runes should not be used for readings by a person who just wants to throw the Runes and look up the answers in a book. Many initiates don't even use Runes for readings, there are so many important and helpful things to do with them. Those who do use them for reading usually use the full ceremonial and treat the matter very seriously. They have their reward in the depths of the insights produced, and the changes made in the situations under examination. 37"}]
