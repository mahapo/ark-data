All life is continuous change! Some for the better, some for the worse. Every day we are confronted with new situations. Some pleasant, others less pleasant! We have to deal with them whether we want to do so or not. We can never be certain about the outcome, but we are working with all that we have available to get the best outcome possible that our imagination can create, and more, if we keep the desire open-ended. To influence the outcome of a specific situation we have many means available. Most of these means are well-known to most everybody. Usually we evaluate a situation, or challenge that we face, first. Then, based on this evaluation we can take whatever steps it takes to make the best of the situation. If, for instance, you want something very badly, then you look for methods to get that which you want. If, for some reason you have to find out that the means that are available to you at the time being are insufficient for the task, then you can take one of two ways: Either you accept the fact that your means are insufficient and you settle for second-best, i.e., you give up, or you look for new means to achieve that goal. There are certainly lots of people out there who always try to tell you that your means are inherently limited and that you should not go for the sky and that it's morally better if you are satisfied with that which you can get easily. In real English those folks means that you should be satisfied with that which they don't want anyway while giving up on things that they try to get for themselves. These sermons are in most cases those folks' means of keeping you out of a competition so that it will be easier for them to get the things they want. It is certainly best to be suspicious of such sermons and to have a closer look at the people who are proffering them. Many of those are folks who skillfully clothe their greed into moralizing spiritual sermons! Naturally they try to convince you to stop searching for new means and to give up your intentions to have the good life they aspire to. Every shepherd's intent is to have as many sheep as possible! Especially if you dare to think of the less conventional means, many of your contemporaries try to convince you that such means are \"evil\". They tell you that astrology is \"evil\", because they may fear that exactly at the time when you are willing and ready to give that large donation, making their lives sweeter, your astrological aspects could show that somehow you are prone to be defrauded out of a lot of money and property, and you may think over your generosity twice before making a move to fatten their billfolds even more! Once you overcome you self-imposed limitations to which you were indoctrinated, you will find out soon that you have more means available to get many more good things in life than you ever may have thought possible. Magickal or psychic methods to change a situation in one's favor have been used successfully for as long as humankind roamed this planet. Of these methods, the work with Runes has a very special importance. This is so, because work with Runes can bring you in contact with the realms of creation, hence more possibility to change a situation from its roots, right at the beginning. Over the centuries past, Runic practice developed many powerful techniques to influence the outcome of a situation. Such methods can be a lot more powerful than the usual calling of gods, angels, spirits, the Holy virgin, etc., all entities that traditionally have helped the rich and the powerful while keeping those who worshipped them most toiling in almost 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"introduction unbearable poverty. The reason for this tremendous power of Runes, as far as adjusting a situation is concerned, is that with Runes you tune into root causes at the creative levels and to creatively work on your destiny rather than dealing with well-defined trend energies. Working with Runes compares with a card player having a hand full of wild cards, rather than well-defined cards. Such a player can name his cards whichever way is desirable for the situation. Most people can feel the runes almost immediately, so it is easy to get this \"feel\" whether something you do works or not. This is especially true when you use a Welz Chi Generator in combination with your Rune work. Should you not have had this experience before, we will be happy to connect you with one of these devices for a day at no cost if you ask us to do so! Then you can find out for yourself the tremendous power of these symbols that connect you with the realms of creation-eternal, consequently how much more powerful Runes can perform your work! Here you will find examples of Runic ceremonials for many situations. Consequently it will be easy for you to devise special Runic ceremonials to handle just about every situation. Precondition is naturally that you have knowledge of Runic practice. Rune energies can be generated with ease. Furthermore, most people, even beginners of Runic practice, can actually feel these energies immediately. To be able to work with this book you do no need a thorough knowledge of Runes. Practically everything you need for success is contained here. Of course, since the invention of the Welz Chi Generator, it is possible to add an enormous boost of life force to Runic ceremonials. We invite you to test the power of this device by getting an individual transfer of energy for a few hours. You can ask to connect this transfer with a Rune of your choice. With this extraordinary test you will certainly have a Runic experience, the power of which you will surprise. 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Rune Ceremonial Basics What are the Basics? To be successful with a Runic ceremonial you need to be familiar with its elements. Therefore you will need to gain knowledge of 1. the 18 stanzas of the \"Magical Poem\", each of which is the trigger of one Runes 2. The mantras of each Rune. When chanting its mantra, you can trigger the power of the Rune. 3. The Body postures and hand positions of the Runes will transform your body or your hand into a \"window\" through which the Runic energy can flow from the realms of creation into your setup. Again, you can increase the power of this flow with the help of the life force generator! 4. The meanings of the Runes that are descriptions of the creative energies that connect with each Rune and its effects. This knowledge is indispensable if you want to design effective Rune ceremonials that have the effect that you envision. 5. Basic knowledge of ceremonials in general and of Rune ceremonials in particular. 6. The proper grounding procedures that are necessary to get rid of Rune energies after the work is done 7. The meaning of the elements in general and of Thor's Hammer in particular. 8. An understanding of the function of the Rune realms and methods to connect with them. In addition to the above it will be useful to gain knowledge of 1. Exact runic frequencies (sound pitches) 2. Runes and chakras 3. The Runic zodiacs 4. Knowledge of life energy and its relation to light energy 5. Odin's Rune Song. 6. Aligning the elements (see the course on cosmic consciousness) You will find all of this in the Basic Rune course and other publications on our web sites. Odin's Rune Song I know myself hanging on the wind cold tree for nine icy nights. Wounded by the spear, consecrated to Wodan I consecrated to myself. I was hanging on the mighty tree which conceals man Where man grew out of its roots. They offered me neither bread nor wine So I bent down in search. I recognized the Runes; wailing I grasped them. Until I sank down from the tree. Now I began to increase, to be wise, To grow and to feel well. From the word, word grew after word And deed shaped to deeds with deeds. Now I know the songs like no wise one knows And none of the children of men. And should these songs, o human child, be un-learnable to you for sheer endless time; 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Rune Ceremonial Basics Grasp them as you get hold of them, use them as you hear of them. Hail you if you retain them! The Song of Odin, the Magical Poem, the Rune Songs and the structures of Runic ceremonials, contain deep cryptic and symbolic significance. The writers of the songs and poems used such language to describe that which pertains to the realms of the physio-psychic, the metaphysical, the hyper physical, and the transcendental. They used ritual to trigger experience of things that words cannot describe easily. Odin's Rune Song and the eighteen stanzas of the Magical Poem show clearly the initiation- oriented content of the powerful ancient tradition of the Runes. They also contain keys for the practical use of the Runes. Personal experience with Runes will give you all the evidence that you need to understand this aspect of the eighteen Sacred Futhork Runes. In their graphic representation Runes are derived from the Hexagon with the three inscribed diameters. This shape is often referred to as \"The World Crystal\". In this shape the eighteen, Number of the runes, becomes apparent: eighteen surfaces of this crystal! Singing Runes compares to singing mantras of power. Once you sing a Rune consciously, you turn on a switch that gives you access to transcendental energies, whether you want this to happen or not. Slowly the Runes will then communicate to you how to manage and how to use their energies, provided, of course, that you are ready to accept the Runes and to overcome the bondage of your self-imposed limitations and the restrictions of the world tree. When I refer to Runes as triggers and say that they communicate with you, this describes only a partial aspect of the Runes. Whatever description of Runic power you get from such practice, this is not all that the Runes are. Runes are way beyond mappings! Therefore it is irrelevant how you view Runes, whether as energies, as spiritual beings, as gods, as mantras, or all of this. Runes will remain beyond the attempts to describe them, beyond words, beyond mappings, but open to direct connection with them on the un-speakable levels of experience. Every Rune connects with Worlds of Creation and Formation. Therefore, whenever you connect with a Rune you may expect material effects that relate to the specific Rune with which you are working. Be aware then that the most powerful methods are all too often also the simplest ones! In fact, many of these powerful methods are of a simplicity that most people cannot comprehend. Consequently they practice for years to master that which they could have mastered in a matter of weeks, if not days! The deepest mysteries are often also the easiest ones to penetrate, but they self-protect against misuse and profanation. The magical poem F A I know the Songs that no wise woman knows And none of the children of men. The first Song is HELP, and help it will Against sorrow, hurt, and any distress. U R A second I know; quite useful to the children of men Who practice the healing hand: It chases disease and all pain, It cures hurts and all wounds. 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Rune Ceremonial Basics T H O R N A third Song I know: If urgency tells me To tie the opponent with magic Then I dull the steel of my foes So that their swords will not cut anymore. O S A fourth Song I know: If an enemy puts A tie of pliable limbs; Then I speak the spell, the shackles break on the feet And the fetters break on the hands. R I T This I know as a fifth: If in hostile flight An arrow shoots into the crowd; Not matter how it threatens, I block its force By grasping it tightly with the look of my eyes.

M A N A fifteenth I count: That which Volkrast, the gnome Sang by the gates of the day; To strength for the Aesir, and to force for the Albs, And to clear my own senses.

The one only knows who is in my arms as my only lover. Obviously the nature of these eighteen stanzas is such that the student who can read between the lines will notice immediately that books could be written about the hidden, esoteric, meanings of the stanzas. To gain a thorough understanding of these 18 Rune stanzas, you need to open up to their symbolic messages plus their evocative meanings. This opening up will happen naturally as you continue practicing Runes and the more you practice the more these deep symbolic meanings will reveal themselves to you. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Rune Meanings Access Keywords, meanings and correlations of Runes. Note: Be sure to read, meditate, re-read, re-meditate these meanings and key words several times. As you tune into the Runes time and again, continuously new insights will open up to you and your power to handle creative energies will increase! The Rune FA FA is the Rune of original fire. It is a Rune that symbolizes the cosmos and the universe. FA symbolizes fire that acts creatively in love. It is will that sparks manifestation down to the material levels. FA is one of the Runes that rules the Salamanders, spirits of the fire element. It symbolizes change from within the creative levels and spiritual creation. FA represents the Phoenix that rises from its ashes. It represents spiritual creation, Fate, and Divine Law. FA is a Rune of fate, of mobility, and of wealth. It is said to connect with the Norse god Freyr and it connects easily with the Rune KA. Uses of FA: You can use FA to attract and absorb Solar and Lunar energy as well as the energies of the planets and fixed stars. Practice this absorption of energy with the body posture of FA. FA also strengthens the personal magnetism. On the etheric planes it symbolizes the electric fluid. Practice of FA strengthens the personal magnetism and the spiritual powers that you project into your environment. It is useful at the beginning of psychic healing. Use FA to increase wealth! FA is one of the Runes that you use to transfer energies. It is helpful in your practice to unfold the original fire. Time of the Year: December 22 through January 12. Runic Zodiac of 18: 0 degrees Capricorn to 20 degrees Capricorn. Note: The correlation with the degrees in the zodiac is an affinity not an exact superimposition. This means that the astrological zodiac may have its beginning anywhere in the Runic zodiac. The Runic zodiac has 18 Runic months of 20 degrees each. Number: 1 Mantra: fffffffff (visualize fire or a bright red and flaming Fa symbol). Note: Put the emphasis on the f-sound! some people make the mistake to chant faaaaaaaaaa, with hardly and \"f\" at the beginning. Chant: ffffffffffffaaa (much more \"f\" than \"a\"!) The Rune UR UR is the Rune of original cause, or root-causes, of cosmic and planetary events. It is the Rune of original time at the threshold of creation, original eternity and roots of eternity: Time- les time where space-time loses its relevancy. UR connects with cause of causes, with original creation, with original immortality, and with original law of vibration. UR is the threshold of creation that FA energizes with its impulse. It is creation for which 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Rune Meanings created deities (or, even more ridiculous, anthropomorphic collective egregors of religions - assumed gaseous mammals above the clouds) take undeserved credit. It is original knowledge. Mythologically speaking the roots of the world tree, Yggdrasil, reach into the Rune UR. It is here where the tree Norns, goddesses of fate and destiny, are spinning the threads of the web of time that determines the fates of humans and of gods. Here the fountain of wisdom is running to which depths the gods (think here also of the gods within!) \"descend\" to gain knowledge and wisdom. Uses: From UR is coming forth continuously new existence. On the etheric levels it represents the healing Orgone energy, life force, and its structural linkages and magical uses. UR opens clair-audience. Work with UR increases your capability to recognize the true origin, or root, of the universe and the true causes of everything. Practice of UR strengthens your healing energies. Time of the year: January 13 through February 3 Runic Zodiac of 18: 20 degrees Capricorn to 10 degrees Aquarius. Number: 2 Mantra: oo - oo - oo - oo rrrr. Emphasis on the oo-sound! The Rune THORN THORN is the Rune of activity and of the active mind. In this capacity, the Rune THORN is symbolized as the Rune of the master of the swords. It is a Rune of active exchange and one of the Runes that represent Thor's Hammer. THORN is a Rune of polarities. While FA is the spark of creation and original structure, UR connects with the chaos at the threshold of creation, THORN symbolizes the emerging of opposite polarities from the zero point energy of chaos as it gains its first structure. From the realm of opposite polarities THORN reaches much deeper into multiple polarities of an infinite order. As Rune of opposing polarities THORN represents life and death, hot and cold, light and darkness, etc. It is a Rune of opposites that actually are polarities of one and the same process. Therefore THORN is also a rune of eternal return and as such contains in itself the mystery of the thorn that awakens from sleep. The THORN that touches the zero energy of chaos brings forth continuous creation. THORN is the Rune of the dowsing rod, of lightning and thunder, of magnetic transfer and of mental telepathy. THORN awakens in us the will to act and to creatively act upon our universe. It helps us get in touch with the continuous change of day and night, waning and waxing, life and death. THORN protects us against attacks, especially magical attacks. The mantra of THORN strengthens the aura.

Time of the year: April 13 through May 5. Number: 6 Mantra: k-k-k-k-aaaa. THE RUNE HAGAL Fire refers here to \"the fire of thirst.\" HAG-ALL = take care of the universe. It contains the symbolism of the omnipresent and all-penetrating creative energy. HAGAL is the symbolism of the builder-architect of the worlds. The seven is the rhythm of the Solar System. It connects with Venus-entities (Venus = 7), who create the world in an eternal NOW. HAGAL is the Rune of the world tree, of the world, of the tree of life. It is a combination of MAN and YR, NOD and EH. HAGAL is maintenance and equilibrium of the moving universe. It is the Rune of the zodiac, and mother of all Runes that signifies continuous change. HAGAL leads to the spiritual leader. In the microcosm it represents man, in the macrocosm it represents the universe. Uses: HAGAL gives protection and harmony.

It brings spiritual powers and wisdom. It increases the functions of the pineal gland and of the solar plexus. Time of the year: May 6 through May 28. Number: 7 Mantra: hag-all The Rune N O D NOD is the Rune of karma. In the Northern tradition, NOD is the Rune of the Norn, goddess of destiny. It is the Rune of karmic debts (the Norn SKULD), of karmic law, of karmic need. NOD signifies Divine justice that balances. \"Hate\" in the song refers to unresolved karma. Nod helps to master your karma after you have accepted it and recognized it as a structuring process rather than the primitive assumption of cause-effect. NOD symbolizes the appearance out of the infinite, out of the undefined. It connects with the Divine that manifests itself within the finite universe, for \"a god who does no manifest itself is dead\" (Feuerbach). Uses: NOD makes you aware of your karmic debts and it helps dissolve karma. It leads to truth and fitting into the cosmic order, or the Divine Plan. NOD brings the protection of high spiritual entities of our Solar System. Use your karma and live it consciously. The emphasis here is on \"use\". With NOD you can recognize that karma is a structuring process rather than strict cause-effect and that the postulate (\"law\") of cause-effect is nothing but a human fallacy! Especially with the practice of NOD will you gain the insight of just how powerful work with the creative levels (Runes) can be, especially when it comes to the shifting of dimensions of time! 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Rune Meanings Time of the year: May 29 through June 20.

Published by Magitech Press P.O. Box 1298, Woodstock, GA 30188 BODY POSTURES AND HAND POSITIONS OF RUNES By Karl Hans Welz Grand Rune Master, The Knights of Runes Inventor of the Chi GeneratorÂ®, a generator of Od (life force), OrgoniteÂ®, etc. www.runemagick.com, www.runeradionics.com, www.magitech.com As you know by now, Runes can be viewed as shape-vibrations. In other words, specific shapes can trigger their energies. Shapes, in this respect, are to be understood in a very general way. The first thing which comes into the mind when we talk about shapes, is no doubt the graphic outline of a Rune. Another shape is the mantra, which is a shape of sound. As you will learn soon, Mantras can be sung in many variations, which helps you experience the various shades of Runic energies. Similarly, you can add the shapes of \"color\" to the Runic symbol, or environments. In the above, we showed you two extremes of shapes: first the graphic outline, then the sound. Those shapes may be combined, of course, which adds to the potentials of your Runic practice. One realm of shapes, which is closely connected with, often derived from, the graphic outline of Runes, are hand-and body positions of Runes. When posing those, something from the purely graphic outline is lost, no doubt. However, if you consider the conductivity of energy of the human body, then much is gained. Hand and body positions add extremely valuable dimensions to your Runic practice. Especially when those positions are practiced in a ceremonial set-up, by several persons, each person perhaps representing one specific Rune, or several persons forming one single Rune. On this web site I am showing you the basic hand and body positions of Runes. 1 6"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"rune magick positions THE RUNE FA BODYPOSITION: Standing upright, feet together, both arms pointing upward in an angle of approximately 30 degrees from horizontal line.

WHY IT IS A GOOD THING FOR YOU TO STUDY AND PRACTICE RUNES The SYMBOLISM of the 18 Sacred Futhork Runes gives you ACCESS TO THE REALMS OF CREATION. THEREFORE... If you are a PRACTICING PSYCHIC who uses psychic capabilities to help others, Runic practice will add an invaluable new dimension to your profession. If you are an ASTROLOGER, READER, or COUNSELOR, Runic practice can bring you beyond the status of a mere bystander. No loner are you limited to just telling your clients what trends are in store for them and, perhaps, how they may adjust. Now you can actively work on your clients' destinies and help straighten out their lives. This added capability ensures repeat business and better reward. If you are a LECTURER or TEACHER of metaphysics or if you study to become one, knowledge of Runic practice will add to your classes. Especially the teaching of Rune Yoga is very rewarding, since its effects will be felt immediately by the majority of your students. If you are involved in the HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS, Rune Yoga and Runic energy treatment (using the energies of the world crystal) will increase the scope of your methods available. 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"rune magick positions If you are SEEKING ENLIGHTENMENT, Runes are one of the fastest and safest ways to deep mystical experiences, to insights in the workings of the universe and to experience on Oneness. If you want to achieve your FULLEST POTENTIAL AS A HUMAN BEING, Runic practice gives you access to the realms of creation. Runic practice is your gateway to your chakras and to your inherent psychic powers. Chances are, you may find a few more reasons why. I am looking forward to hearing from you Karl Hans Welz Grand Rune Master The Knights of Runes 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Rune Ceremonial Utensils About Ceremonials This publication is meant to be down to basics. Its purpose is to provide you with step by step instructions. All that you, the practitioner, need to do is follow these instructions. Later then you will design your own rituals. When practicing Rune ceremonies you are using technologies that involve Higher Order Energy Complexes (HOEC's). Knowledge of the principal theories of these HOEC's is not essential for the proper performance of ceremonials with Runes, but it certainly would be helpful. Study the Rune courses that you find on this web site thoroughly, perhaps become member of a Rune study group or start your own one. This more intensified practice of Runes will help you gain very helpful insights in the characteristics and uses of HOEC's. Although much of the \"machinery\" (so to say) that is designed to handle HOEC's properly is of a finer density, with etheric, astral, etc., components, their focal points usually are material. These material focal points are the utensils that you are using in the ceremonial, of course. One of essential requirements in any ceremonial is an abundant supply of \"raw energy\" that is often generated by strong emotional forces such as sex magick or the killing of chicken and other animals. The high-strung emotional outbursts in a charismatic church serve the same purpose, of course. Any good ceremonial provides you with a method to develop such strong methods of generating life force. Group practices with Runes are extremely powerful. An alternative, of course, is a generator of life force (Welz Chi Generator), which allows you then to use your freed-up energies to boost the actual purpose of the ceremonial rather than using them for routine-life-force generation. Therefore the Life force generator is a decisive advantage for you in any ceremonial that you practice. This is especially true for Rune ceremonials, where it adds to the sheer power and effect of a ceremonial that, by nature, already develops strong fields of life force! You can call us and we will set up a connection with one of our life force generators. Add to this life force one or more Runes of your choice, and the power that you generate - and feel - will tell you more than a thousand words! About Ceremonial Utensils As I mentioned before, ceremonial utensils are focal points for more subtle, higher order arrangements and energy components that are essential for the ultimate success of the ceremonial. When we speak about the \"symbolic meaning\" of a ceremonial utensil, we generally refer to the structures of the Higher Energy Components that are connected with the specific utensils. Another important characteristic of utensils is the following: as the utensil is used on a regular basis, the transcendental - and other - energies (HOEC's) that are attached to them increase, adjust to the operator (hence the necessity not to \"lend\" any utensil to others) and increase in power and effectiveness. Eventually such a utensil can function without the practitioner needing to be consciously aware of its presence nor of its inherent characteristics and specific functions. Therefore a dagger, for example, is no longer just a knife, but it is the instrument that gives the operator domination over astral energy complexes (astral \"entities\"). The basic arrangement of all utensils will get your \"machinery\" ready to function smoothly. It allows you to define the energies of a higher order that you want to use and to cause them to work for you. In the old language that meant that with the help of such utensils you can \" tell the spirits your will and send them wherever you wish to send them, and the spirits will be bound to obey you\". 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Rune Ceremonial Utensils An important factor, then, is to follow the instructions for ceremonials here so that you have the Runic energies and depending HOEC's perform as you intended and to bring you the desired results on whatever level you projected them. In the following you will learn about the main utensils that you can use in Runic ceremonials. Specific Utensils 1. The Temple The temple is your \"workshop,\" or, better yet, your place from which you are triggering the HOEC's (spirits) for specific purposes such as spiritual work. It is the space within which you arrange all your tools, or machinery. It is your specific outer realm (outer Rune Realm) from which you can reach every point of your universe. You may, in fact, see the temple as a symbol of your universe. As is the case with any workplace, cleanliness enhances proper functioning. Since you are working with HOEC's, or \"psychic energies,\" be aware that the temple needs also to be free from any kind of psychic debris or psychic pollution, otherwise the results of your practices may be negatively influenced. Many banishing rituals are designed to clean the temple from undesirable energies, so that psychic energies can be projected without undesirable interference. In Runic practice, you may use the Runes AR, IS and MAN to cleanse. Some students may not have a special room or space available for their temple. Although a specific assigned space for a temple has great advantages, it is not absolutely essential. Of course, you can practice Runes anywhere. You establish your temple by determining what space will serve as your temple, and by cleansing it from any undesirable psychic energy with AR, MAN, and IS every time before you begin to practice. You may define the boarder of the temple mentally or with a wand or dagger. Depending on the situation, you may chant mentally (yes, you CAN perform a fully valid ceremonial in the midst of a crowd, without anybody noticing what you are doing), or you may chant aloud while in the body positions of IS (grounding position), MAN, and AR. 2. The Circle of Protection The protective circle within your temple is a space within which you are working, unencumbered by any energy that may be attracted by your work. The circle makes sure that no energy will be present except those energies that you desire to be present. It is a barrier against negative energies and also against entities (energies) that may interfere with those HOEC's (Higher Order Energy Complexes) which you are going to trigger. This way, the circle serves not only as your personal protection from hostile HOEC's (spirits), but it also insures a clean functioning of your Rune Yoga practice. An ideal circle is formed by laying out all 18 Runes, which will then be in tune with your Inner Rune Realm. Have the sixteen Runes arranged on the periphery of your circle, starting with FA in the North, counter clockwise to YR, which will then be on the right side of FA. Have EH and GIBOR inside the circle, since those Runes symbolize the marriage of opposites and the universe of the symbolism. EH West and GIBOR East just inside the outer circle of Runes. The diameter of the circle is dependent on the amount of people who are participating in the ceremonial, and of course, considerations of space. 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Rune Ceremonial Utensils 3. The Altar The altar is the actual workplace, or your control panel. In more advanced practice, it can also serve as a point of manifestation for specific HOEC's (spirit, entity), in which case you have to observe specific measures of protection and insulating methods. Being your control panel, it will contain utensils that connect with the specific structures of the universe and HOEC's with which you are going to work in your ceremonial. Therefore, the arrangement of utensils on the altar and the symbols used will vary according to the purpose (s) of your ceremonial. You will, however, notice some CFP (common functional principle) on all arrangements of your altar. The size of the altar depends on the number of people attending, size of your temple, amount of utensils, etc. For most individual purposes and for small groups, an altar the size of 24 x 30 inches will be adequate. 4. Rune Staves Since you will use Runic energies, a set of triggers to those energies on top of the altar is of utmost importance. These Rune staves will be arranged in a circle, as shown in the diagram. More than the staves around yourself and the altar, the staves on the altar are triggers that connect with your Inner Rune Realm and the Runic Realms of Creation. Practical experience has established that a circle of Crystal Rune Staves by itself can give a clean temple and the protective circle as outlined above. However, I still recommend that you practice the banishing and cleansing as well as the establishing of the protective circle wherever possible. You may use Runes made of cardboard and charged accordingly, or you may use Runes made of wood. Crystal Runes are excellent and superior even to the traditional wooden Runes for several reasons. One of the reasons is that the crystalline structure of quartz represents HAGAL, and the \"mother\" of the Runic symbolism (the hexagon with the three inscribed diameters). Look at an ideally formed Quartz crystal from above and you see the HAGAL Rune inside a hexagon. Another reason for the awesome strength of crystal Runes lies in the fact that crystal energies can be modified and directed: modified by Runic energies that are very kin to the crystalline energies, and directed by means of gridding. All practitioners who used crystal Runes (and compared to wood) noticed the difference in power immediately! You can look up www. elementproducts.com and ask if you have specific wishes for your ceremonial needs. Among other things you find there: 1. A deck of eighteen Rune cards that may also be used for divination purposes. These cards have ONLY the Rune on it, perhaps their meanings on the back. \"Neat\" New Agey pictures of Elves, Gods, Goddesses, and other artistic clutter would water down the energy of the Runes. 2. Wooden Rune Staves, and 3. Crystal Rune Staves. 5. The Magical Wand While the candles connect with the will and the worlds of emanation, the wand is the tool that expresses the will of the practitioner. It is your tool to dominate the HOEC's that have characteristics belonging to the mental spheres. The symbolic meanings of the power rod or wand will be the more familiar to you the more you practice with Runes and other ceremonials. 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Rune Ceremonial Utensils 6. THE INCENSE BURNER The incense burner connects you with the mental worlds, with HOEC's that are part of the mental spheres, and with the air element in general. 7. THE DAGGER The dagger (or sword) represents your mind which controls the emotions and HOEC's that belong to the astral spheres. Again, while the incense tunes into mental worlds, the dagger uses mental energies. 8. THE POWER ROD The Power rod is an ideal combination of wand and dagger. It is very suited for work with Runes, because of the use of a quartz crystal as a tip of the power rod. Very powerful is a tube that acts as an orgone accumulator. You may put alternating layers of organic and metallic materials (plastic duct tape and aluminum duct tape) around it to make it an effective orgone accumulator. Again, look up www.elementproducts.com for orgone accumulators and orgone generators. 9. The Cup with Water (or Wine) The cup connects with the astral worlds and with the emotions. It provides the energy necessary to bring results in your ceremonies. It symbolizes the emotional power of the practitioner. Drinking the water or wine aligns the astral-emotional energies with the goal of the ceremonial. Water accumulates Odic energies (life energies) which are \"programmed\" with the goals of the healing ceremonial. In fact, any liquid that you like to drink is good! Engrave the runes in the cup! 10. THE HAMMER OF THOR The Hammer of Thor represents your consciousness that can connect with any point in space- time and then return back \"to yourself.\" In other words, the Hammer of Thor can be projected to any interval in the space-time continuum of your universe. It can be developed into being your specific tool to break the self-imposed limitations of space-time. It symbolizes conscious action which is charged and energized by the other elements (wand, sword, and cup). Once energized, the Hammer of Thor will perform for you. Again, with repeated practice you will learn more and more about this most powerful tool of Runic ceremonials. Thor's Hammer is perhaps the best symbol of your conscious projection. It collects within itself the three elements of the will, mental, and astral-emotional spheres. Once you have charge Thor's Hammer, you have aligned all elements toward your specific purpose: your will, mind, emotions, and consciousness. All you need to do now, is to throw Thor's Hammer (its higher plane components) toward your goal, which is embedded in an interval of your conscious space-time continuum. Thor's Hammer is your tool on the material planes that reaches beyond the confines of space and time. It is your instrument of power, your connection to your universe, your power of projecting into your universe whatever energy you charge the hammer. Thor's Hammer, therefore, is the most powerful Runic talisman, symbolizing the 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Rune Ceremonial Utensils element earth on your altar. You need to learn to use Thor's Hammer properly. Tune into the Nordic mythology of the god Thor and his hammer, and you will gain additional information about this powerful tool of Rune Practice. The material hammer of Thor remains on your altar, of course, but its spiritual parts, or components, you project them to the desired goal. You do this directing with the powers of your imagination. Be aware that the more you practice using Thor's Hammer the more skillful you will become in its use. In fact, RUNE YOGA TEACHES YOU THE SKILL OF PROJECTING AND USING THE HAMMER OF THOR! Ideally, your Hammer of Thor should be a true talisman, which you can wear as a pendant. You may use a piece of paper with Thor's Hammer drawn on it. 11. Candles Candles symbolize the fire element, your will powers or the world of emanation. Naturally there is much more symbolic meaning attached to candles than the fire element. There is hardly any ceremonial where Light would not play an important role. Light is neutral. Depending on the action to be performed it assumes some color. Since Light is so important, most ceremonials contain and include something that symbolizes Light. Candles are the preferred utensil to symbolize Light. Of course, there are deeper symbolic meanings connected with candles than that of giving Light. As you become familiar with various methods involving candles you will understand better the many symbolic meanings that candles connect with. Consequently you will be capable to touch upon more realms that involve the symbolism of the candles This will greatly increase the effectiveness of your magical operations. Candles, as we know, are made of various materials, mostly paraffin, more seldom true bees' wax. Candles may be scented and colored, tailored to special lengths and shapes, etc. As you progress, you will learn to include colors and shapes of candles into the overall symbolism of your ceremonial. The significance of candles reaches into may levels. Since candles are mostly thought to symbolize Light, they are the only source of light in many ceremonials. The specific color of the candle will symbolize the sphere(s) with which the operator wants to be in contact during the ceremonial. The number of candles used has another symbolic meaning. Operators who practice evocations and who work with the higher order energies that are part of planetary spheres match the number of candles with the number of the planet: three candles for evocations of Saturn or of beings of the sphere of Saturn, four candles for Jupiter, five for Mars, six for the Sun, seven for Venus, eight for Mercury, and nine for the Moon. Candles are an excellent tool to help the powers of visualization and imagination. The flame of a candle is an ideal focus. In some magical practices you may internalize this focus. When you practice with Runes you can use any number of candles that correspond to the specific higher order energies used in your operation. You may use one candle that has the Rune engraved which you practice. Instead of engraving the Rune, you can put the candle (candleholder) on a piece of cardboard or wood that has the Rune drawn on it. This Rune should be charged before use. Excellent is a set of 18 candle holders, each one with another Rune drawn or engraved on it. Many ceremonials require the use of more than one candle. It is good practice to use one candle for each Rune that you use in the ceremonial. You can use three âneutralâ candles, i.e., candles that have no Rune inscribed. These three candles would then symbolize the three groups of Futhork Runes. You may use five candles if you want to take advantage of the dynamics of the pentagram. You may use six candles which represent the Hexagram, or six 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Rune Ceremonial Utensils candles with a seventh candle in the center, if you want to symbolize the Hexagram with the three inscribed diameters, mother of Runes. You may use nine candles which, in Runic ceremonial, represent the Rune IS, the true ego, bridge to your Higher Self. You may go all the way and use eighteen candles in your ceremonial, one for each Rune. When you use eighteen candles, I recommend that you inscribe one Rune on each candle. You arrange these eighteen candles the same way you arrange the 18 Rune Staves. You should put one candle to the side of each Rune stave. Candles of bees wax have some advantages over candles made of paraffin: There is more \"life\" in them. The color of the candles is to match the purpose of your operation. White candles are good for every operation. In the case of bees wax candles, the natural wax color is equally universal. One candle alone or two candles serve as an excellent focus. Such a focus is very helpful for your concentration and visualization powers. Two techniques are useful, depending on the number of candles. While looking at the flame of one candle see visions in the halo around the candle. When you use two candles, look in the space between the flames of both candles. The best distance is between six and eight inches apart. In either case you will better be able \"to grasp the arrow with the look of your eyes.\" (see Rune Lesson 5 of the Basic Rune Course) Whatever shape, amount, color, scent, etc., of your candle or candles you choose, they will add to your ceremonial and can give your will power its first direction and it provides the trigger in the world of emanation Look at elementproducts.com for Bees wax candles! Preparation of Your Utensils Repeated use of a utensil connects you with specific energies (the energies connected to the utensil) without you needing to tie up your own forces. Naturally your own forces then can be used with much more ease towards the success of your operation. In this, the utensil takes on the function of a generator of energies that belong to the higher levels. Considering this aspect of utensils you must realize the importance of the proper preparation of your utensils, including yourself. Naturally you are the most important of all utensils, since you too will be part of the machinery of subtle energies that you are setting up with the ceremonial. Ideally all utensils should be purchased new and only you should use your utensils after you have them charged and blessed. Never lend your utensils to an other person. An exception may be reusable materials such as candles and incense as well as other utensils of a ceremonial that is set up for group practice rather than individual practice. Make a clear distinction between utensils that belong to a group and your personal ones. The same is valid for the Rune staves and the Hammer of Thor. Now to the preparation and blessing of your utensils. The simplest method to prepare a utensil before use is to charge it with your energy. Put yourself into a meditative state and preferably establish your rune realms. Then put the utensil in front of yourself and hold your hands above it. While inhaling, visualize your body drawing energy from the universe. When exhaling visualize this energy stream, through your hands into the utensil. 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Rune Ceremonial Utensils The charging, of course, has many variations. As you continue with your Rune practice and progress, your insights will increase and so will the means available to you. Prepare all your utensils by charging them. With all utensils charged, you may now being with the Runic ceremony. 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Basic Rune Ceremony The Basic Ceremony This is a basic outline of the basic ceremonial practice into which you can incorporate in any ceremonial of your choice by adjusting it accordingly to the specific purpose of that ceremony. 1. Take your diary or book of ceremonials and write in it the date, purpose of the operation, means employed, and way you will111 proceed. Keep the diary on your altar, so you can follow exactly the outline that you have written down. Besides helping you to follow exactly the outline of your ceremony, the diary has another important purpose: At a later date you can compare which of the ceremonials worked best for you. Of course you need not repeat to write down the basic ceremonial every time. References and special symbols should suffice. 2. Personal preparation: It is very important for you to be well prepared for the operation. This includes leaving all those things behind that trouble you in your everyday life. It is also essential that you DETACH YOURSELF from the situation that you intend to change with the ceremonial. It is very helpful for you to take a bath. The bath cleanses you symbolically from your worries and anything else that may contaminate the course of your ceremonial. A bath also can be used to purify your spiritual centers, provided that you take it with this attitude. Wear clean clothes for the operation. You may have some special clothes for your ceremonials or a special robe. Followers of the old religion prefer to practice nude, because for them nudity symbolizes freedom and direct contact with the living universe. 3. Setting of the outer Realm. The outer realm is the space within which you are working. It is your temple. The set up of your outer realm symbolizes the universe upon which you intend to operate. Make sure that you will not be disturbed in your work. Also make sure that the room in which you are working is clean. You need an altar. A table will do. Arrange your ceremonial utensils as shown in the picture. Leave enough space for the candles and Rune staves that you use for the ceremonial. You may set a circle of Rune Staves around the table, large enough so that you can move in this circle. Have the Runes EH and GIBOR on the left and right sides of the table, or altar. Have the Runes that you need for your ceremonial removed from the circle and set it on the table in the space where you have the center of operations. Set the cup with water or wine on the table, as well as the incense burner, one altar candle, Thor's Hammer, and the Rune dagger. Put there your book of ceremonials and your diary so that you can use them with ease. Arrange the center of operations according to the ceremonial and its purpose. You may either stand or have a chair available for sitting down in front of the table. Now you are ready to set up the space within which you are going to work: your inner and outer Rune Realms. First tune into each Rune in the circle by singing the stanza of the magical poem for each Rune. You can instead listen to the tape that establishes your inner Rune Realm. Connect each Rune of your inner Rune Realm with the corresponding Rune Stave in your outer Rune Realm. 4. Protective circle: Your next step is to build the protective circle. Take your Rune dagger, first you trace the circle of Rune Staves around the table, then you draw the HAGAL Rune in all four directions, beginning with North (the position of the FA Rune), next West (position of RIT), South (position of IS), then East, position of BAR. Each time you draw the HAGAL Rune in the air, do so with the strongest possible imagination of protection and Oneness with the 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Basic Rune Ceremony universe. Put the dagger back to the side of the incense burner. 5. Light the Altar Candle and say: Light the candles, then say: \"Power of the Light Eternal in the Universe Penetrate darkness. Sacred flame, shine! Bring Light into darkness. Around darkness, around night, Darkness has merged with the Light. Original fire of FA, Burning from the roots of times; Light force of AR, Born of the Sun At the roots of the worlds, Give Light to the seeker!\" 6. Light the Incense and say: \"May the Power of the Runes Lead me to a greater understanding Of the Universe and myself! 7. Hold both hands over the cup with water or wine. Be aware of the purpose of your ceremonials. Project the desired result into the water or wine, if the purpose is related to you personally. Otherwise know that the water element symbolizes emotional strength. Project energy into the water or wine. Then drink part of it. 8. Look at Thor's Hammer. Be aware that the Hammer of Thor is the symbol of your power to draw, to harness, and to project Rune energies. Hold both hands over it, knowing of its power. 9. Now you have finished all preparation and you are ready for the SPECIFIC CEREMONIAL with Runes. You will find these specific ceremonials in the next part of this publication. After you finished with the specific ceremonial you end the ceremony: 10. Say: Powers of .... (name of the Rune or Runes that you used in the ceremony) Thank you for your energy Flow back To the realms of Creation!\" 11. Imagine, or visualize, the Rune energies grounding, flowing into the ground as water flows down the drain or seeps into sandy soil. 12. Extinguish the flame of the altar candle and all other candles. 13. Extinguish the incense burner 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Basic Rune Ceremony 14.

You know that this inner Rune realm is connected with the outer Rune realm that you are about to establish energetically, and both realms are connected to the realms of creation. Introduction: 5. Light the Altar Candle and say the following: \"Powers of the Light Eternal in the Universe Penetrate darkness. Sacred flame, shine! Bring Light into darkness.

As you are in this position you notice yourself being in this realm that you have established previously in your Rune training. You know that all Runes are present and that you are amidst them. You can now draw and harness them at will and you can direct them wherever you intend to do so. For this specific ceremonial you have Runes charged in your inner relam. As you notice them charged, you know that these same Runes stay in contact with the same Runes in your Outer Realm where others can FEEL their prsence nd the also stay in contact with the same Runes in the realms of creation, from where their specific powers of creative impact are continuously drawn during this ceremony. You focus on the Rune NOD. You see it surrounded with light and life force and pulsating. You focus on the Rune MAN. You see it surrounded with light and life force and pulsating. You focus on the Rune SIG. You see it surrounded with light and life force and pulsating. You focus on the Rune BAR. You see it surrounded with light and life force and pulsating.

You see it surrounded with light and life force and pulsating. You focus on the Rune TYR. You see it surrounded with light and life force and pulsating. You are aware that each of these Runes is a key to your ceremonial for success. You may have prepared a bind-rune or a special talisman for success containing these Runes. NOD gives you awareness of karma. It brings you in contact withe the process of karmic structuring and it is the key to overcome and transcend Karma: NOD is your key to transcend the realm of karmic limitations! BAR gives you new birth, new direction. It helps you sprout that which you desire to happen. FA is the beginning of each of the new ventures that you embark on. It provides you with the financial means that are necessary for such ventures. It draws the constructive fire of the beginning. SIG ensures that you have the attitude of a dominant and victorious person. In SIG you are aware that you have the power to overcome everything and that you can be victorious in any venture. MAN causes you to be in touch with your Higher Self that transcends space-time and its connection with the structures of karma. It awakens in you memories coming from the time-less Divine providence. BAR, again, solidifies your new birth into another line of karma: a much more flexible line of permanent success. AR causes you to connect with the changes of your personal structure, attitudes, \"ghosts of the past\", etc., into something useful and supportive for the success that you envision. TYR provides you with success, yet this Rune keeps you from attaching yourself to it and from becoming a slave of your own success. It eliminates that trap of success.

This way the relationship becomes a creative entity by itself. This ceremony marks the beginning of joint work of partners who are either already married or who have a marriage-like relationship. This ceremony can be used for a wedding. It should be performed wither by the two partners jointly with no one else attending, or it can be performed jointly with a group. The setup of the altar should reflect the ceremony. For instance, the names of the participants should be there, perhaps inscribed in candles with Runes. Personal objects that the participants want to charge can be there as well. There is a lot of flexibility allowed and the partners should prepare each step of the ceremony in detail. An alternative would be a Rune Master leading the ceremony. In this case the Rune Master says all chants, which then are repeated by the couple. 1. Initial Meditation: Everybody sits down comfortably. Leave all daily worries, worldly thoughts, etc., behind you and be aware of the special occasion the the uniqueness of the situation in which you are going to embark. Be aware of the Inner Rune Realm and strengthen it in preparation for the ceremony. Be aware that the inner Rune realms of both partners are joined in one and live in it. I suggest that this joining of inner Rune Realms should be practiced before the wedding ceremony. Preparation: 2. All participants chant Odin's Rune Song. 3. Put the set of Rune staves around yourself and the Altar 4. Bless the personal objects that have been put onto the altar. Introduction: 5. Light the Altar Candle and say the following: \"Powers of the Light Eternal in the Universe Penetrate darkness. Sacred flame, shine! Bring Light into darkness. Around darkness, around night, Darkness has merged with the Light. Original fire of FA, Burning since the beginning of times; 100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Gnostic Wedding Ceremony Light force of AR, Born of the Sun At the beginning of the worlds, Give Light to the seeker!\" 6. Take the cups with water or wine. Hold both hands over it. Be aware of the purpose of this ceremonial. Meditate upon the roots of all being. Through the palms of your hands project energy into the water or wine. Be aware that you established now an astral link with the water and be aware that it represents the principle of the soul, or of desire which is at the root of manifestation. Bless the water - do this mentally in silence. Be aware that the energies of the water increase as the ceremonial continues. 7. Everybody takes the body position of YR. chant YR three times: YR -- YR -- YR 8. Light the incense and say: May the power of the Runes Lead us to a greater understanding Of the Universe and of ourselves. May the Power of the Runes Further our path to Oneness. We thank the singer of the Edda For preserving the heritage of Atlantis. We stride the direct path to Oneness. We tear down the fences That separate individuals, groups and nations. Fences that have been Erected by blindness. We are wanderers to higher realms. Unified with all people of good will We work to achieve A unified homeland of humankind On the throne of which Divine Spirit, Divine Wisdom Divine Love Are ruling. 9. Take the body position of MAN Chant MAN three times MAN -- MAN -- MAN 10. Every participant focuses on the Hammer of Thor. You are aware that the energies of the burning candles are transmitted into the water by means of the incense and that the combined energy is then projected upon the Hammer of Thor, which now contains the synthesis of all energies. You are aware that you can direct the energy of the hammer of Thor wherever you decide to direct it so that it ultimately will manifest into your universe. 11.

Chant: These are the candles Of ... And ... The flames of the two candles Are symbols of their love. 14. Charge the outer Rune realm as follows: Take your power rod, or dagger, and point at each Rune of the set around yourself and the altar while you chant the mantra of each Rune and follow up with its stanza from the magical poem. At the same time point at the Rune. Your partner (s) and other participants of the ceremonial go into body-and/or hand positions of each Rune that you chant. They join you in chanting the Rune and keep chanting the Rune while you recite the stanza. Ffffffffaaaaaa (the mantra) I know the Songs that no wise woman knows And none of the children of men.

Everybody sits or lies down in a comfortable position. The couple may connect so that the energies circulate freely within them and spiral to higher and higher levels of intensity. The meditation should be adjusted to the occasion. There is a lot of room for the couple to decide how the Rune realm should look. As you are in this position you notice yourself being in this realm that you have established previously in your Rune training, and you are there together with your partner. You know that all Runes are present and that you are amidst them. You can now draw and harness them at will and you can direct them wherever you intend to do so. For this specific ceremonial you have Runes charged in your inner realm. As you notice them charged, you know that these same Runes stay in contact with the same Runes in your Outer Realm where others can FEEL their presence and the also stay in contact with the same Runes in the realms of creation, from where their specific powers of creative impact are continuously drawn during this ceremony. You focus on the Rune NOD. You see it surrounded with light and life force and pulsating. You focus on the Rune LAF. You see it surrounded with light and life force and pulsating. You focus on the Rune TYR. You see it surrounded with light and life force and pulsating. You focus on the Rune EH. You see it surrounded with light and life force and pulsating.

You may have prepared a bind-rune or a special talisman for this purpose containing these Runes. NOD gives awareness of karma. It brings you in contact with your karmic background and it is the key to overcome karma and to grow beyond karmic limitations. NOD helps you understand karmic reasons for the two becoming one in the Gnostic wedding. LAF gives you knowledge of the cosmic law that ties two lives together and protects the union and embrace where the two join into one. TYR as the Hammer of Thor has the goal of synthesis through unification of the male and female energies. HAGAL gives universal union, or embrace, that generates a new universe, or a new world crystal. EH reminds the partners of the law of the union which leads to the completeness of GIBOR GIBOR is the wheel of life, which is turned as a result of union in mutual embrace.
