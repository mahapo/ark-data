[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Dion Fo rtune Texts > Talismans Talismanic magi c is an intri nsic part of the cerem onial art in gener al, and cannot be consider ed apart t herefrom; but bein g a special app lication of tha t art, it is enti tled to special consideration. If a sacrament is the outw ard and visible sig n of an inward and spiritua l grace, a talism an m ay be consi dered as the material object in which the inw ard and spirit ual grace is stored. A tal isman is, in fac t, nothing more or less tha n a sp iritual storage battery. The man ner in which a tal isman works is diffic ult to define, but the fac t that it works is a mat ter of e xperience. Af ter we hav e consider ed the techni que of the maki ng of talisma ns we shall be in a better position to examine t he principles involved and dedu ce an explana tion of the nat ure and man ner of operating of talism anic magic . If an occultis t wants to dr aw to hi mself powe r of a particul ar type, or to sti mula te a particul ar factor in his na ture, he will start by analyzing that factor into it s primary principles and assign it to its particular station upon the T ree of Lif e. For instance, all oper ations of a combati ve, or defensiv e nat ure would be assigned to Gebur ah, the Sp here of Mars; all those of an artist ic or em otiona l nature to Netzach , the Sphere of V enus. Having thus classified his problem, he w ould then stu dy the symbolism of tha t Seph irah accordin g to the tr aditional signi ficance assi gned to it. Having got clearly in his min d a concep t of the nature of the force in q uestion, he will next consider its opposite aspect that main tains it in equil ibrium ; for inst ance, the opposite aspect of Netzach upon the T ree is Hod, the Sphere of Me rcury , the intellectua l as oppos ed to the artis tic; the opposite aspect of G eburah is Chesed, the Sp here of Ju piter, the benign law-giver, organiz er and preserv er. He will then understan d how the force he desir es must be balanced and held in equilibriu m. Finally, he will consider its Qliphotic mani festation , that is to sa y, its nature when unbala nced an d degener ated. He will then have a clear understandi ng of the whole problem and be able to see it in perspectiv e aga inst the bac kground of the cosmos as a whole, an d he will also know the pa thologies he has to guard again st, and in what direction the force is liab le to go if it becomes un balanced . For insta nce, t he Qliphah correspondin g to Gebur ah is the S phere of the Burners, for unba lanced Geburic force leads to cruelty and destruc tion. It is very nec essary to mak e this careful analysi s of the problem befo re proc eeding to the construction of a tal isman , otherwise one ma y mak e bad worse by in tensifying the trouble. The quarr elsome man, for instance, who has already got too muc h Gebur ah in his composition, might try to inv oke mo re Ge burah in order to get himself out of the hot water that this quarr elsomeness has got hi m into. Wher eas what he needs is a tali sman for Chesed, Mercy , the opposite qualit y to Gebur ah. If he dr aws in more Gebur ah when he has already got too much Gebur ah, the re sult is Qliphotic . Having arriv ed at a clear understan ding of what he intends to do , and knowing that he will hav e to shoulder the responsib ility of any mis takes he may mak e shoul d he have failed to dia gnose his problem correctly, the oper ator then proce eds to design his ta lisman . Certain geometrical forms, colors, letters, numbers, and many other things, are associa ted with every type of cosmic force; these ar e class ified in to thirty -two types, correspond ing to the ten Holy Sephiroth upon the T ree of Life, repres enting ten types of primary forc e, and the T wenty-Two Paths tha t connect them; these ar e classed as secondary or deriv ative forces, arisin g from the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"equilibriu m of the pairs of Sephiroth they connect ; they did not emana te directly from the Source of All Force, bu t were gener ated in the course of the development of the dif ferent Sephiroth; the Seph irotic forc es are spirit ual in type, but the influences of the T wenty-Two Paths mus t be termed astr al, for want of a bet ter expression. In any talisman , therefo re, the Sephirotic aspect will be the sp iritual influence, and the specific mun dane app lication will be sought in the symbolism of the appropriate Path; if the diag nosis has been correctly ma de, it should be on e of the P aths connected with t he selected Sephir ah. The symbolis m will then be in ter- related . A talisman is best made of either parchmen t, which is the dressed skin of an animal , or she et metal, for e xperience shows tha t these hold the ma gnetism better than ordinary paper . It is inter esting to note tha t the subs tances th at have been traditionally used from ti me immemorial are those which mode rn scienc e knows to be good conduc tors of electricity . The substa nces, suc h as silk or w ood, in which tradition ins tructs us to encas e our tal ismans in order to conse rve their energy , are the same t hat mode rn scienc e has pro ven to be effectu al as non-conduc tors. The old adepts said : Do not use o rdinary paper for a tali sman , as it will not hold the force. The modern mechanic knows tha t there is nothing better tha n a piece of paper as an emergency ins ulator if he has to deal with a liv e wire. The re is an elabor ate system of attribu tion of the metals to the di fferent planets - gold to t he sun, silver to the moon, iron to Mars, - and t heoretically , talismans for a particul ar force should be made from t he appropriate metal . In actua l practice, howev er, this is not feasible; t he solid gold talisman of the sun is bey ond the means of all sav e millionaires; the lead talisma n of Sa turn is too w eighty for pr actica l use; the iron talism an of Mars is liab le to rust. The simplest and most pr actical method is to use a copper base enameled with the sym bolic colors. And this brings us to the question of the na ture of the efficacy of talis mans. Why should a talis man be made of lead, or tin, or gold , accordin g to t he fo rce it is designed to car ry? In what way does it influence t he fo rce, or the force influence i t? In the pr esent state of the exact science, our knowl edge of the occult arts is largely empirical. That some sort of sub tle el ectrica l factor enters in to the ma tter ther e is good reason to believ e, for tradition ins tructed its st udents to deal with ma gical forces after the manner of an electrical install ation thousan ds of y ears befor e anything was known of electricity . There are man y weird and wonderful recipes in folklo re and witchcr aft that have no value sa ve the psy chologi cal one of prolonging attent ion and gener ating emotion by the re ady means of fear and horror, but when we find traditiona l practices in acco rdance with an electrical analogy , we ar e justified in assum ing that they are based upon pr actical expe rience in handli ng a force of an electrical nature. It is extremely probab le tha t recently dev eloped instrumen ts for magn ifying and measuring electrical charges of v ery low potency would yield som e very in terestin g results if ap plied to magic . We may be justified in speculat ing that subtle el ectrica l chan ges do tak e place when an amu let or talisma n is charged, and that these ar e due to the personal magnetis m of t he pe rson consecr ating it. That personal mag netism is heigh tened by ceremonial work is a fact well known by experi ence to those who pr actice the occult arts."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"We may therefore conclu de that the use of an el ectrica lly active ma terial out of which to mak e a tal isman has a basis in experi ence. But what shall we say of the colors, symbols and na mes tha t go to make up the talis man itself ? Thes e can hav e no el ectrical effect one w ay or the other . In my opin ion, their importance is psychologica l, but in a more extended sense tha n that term is gener ally understood. Let us consider an analogy . In an electrical pow er sta tion, the switc h-box, in addition to the wo rd: 'DANGE R!', may have a skull and cross-bones pain ted on it bright scarlet, thus causin g even the most scat ter-brained to pause and t hink. Now, why is the skull and cross-bones a mor e potent sym bol tha n the w ord: DANGE R and why is scarlet paint more effectiv e than black? Because skulls and skeletons are associated in our minds with deat h, and red with blood. So it is with the ma gical symbols. Even the unin itiated associates these odd- looking scribbles wit h powe r. To the init iated, 'conditioned' to symbolis m, they con vey a sense of a particul ar kind of pow er. A talis man is only effectiv e when the pers on who mak es it has perfo rmed medita tions upon each of the symbols inscribed upon it, so tha t they are full of sig nifican ce fo r him. In maki ng these medita tions, he builds up a thou ght-form in the astr al light correspon ding to each force thus dealt with; when he inscribes a symbol on the tal isman , this though t-form he has made is associated with it; thus is the astr al storage bat tery charged, the thou ght-form in the astr al light being a link with t he cosmic force r epres ented . If he has not performed such work as this , and the symbols have no real signi ficance for him , the result ing talis man will ha ve no mo re tha n a su perstitious value as givin g rise to auto- suggestion . The real v alue of a talism an lies in the work tha t I put into it; ther efore second- hand talis mans made by some one els e are only of use to the supersti tious, like the quack medicine bou ght at fairs. But ther e is no question about it but that the mental work tha t goes to the makin g of a talisma n has a very re al effect upon the personality , defini tely ene rgizin g it in the chosen direction, and that the pow er thus gene rated goes far bey ond the influence of a purely sub jectiv e auto-su ggestion. Let this be noted, however, -- it is not the talis man that is doin g the work, but the energy that has been pu t into the talisma n. Miracles do not happen , if, by a miracle we understand an arbitr ary interfe rence with the na tural sequence of cause and effect; ma gic, in m y expe rience, always works through natural cha nnels, its efficac y lying in the increase of en ergy t hat it causes to flow in those channels . If you mak e a talis man for wealth , you will not find a show er of golden sovereigns fallin g around it, but you m ay, and v ery probably will find that opportuni ties for increasing your earnin g powe r will come y our w ay, and pro vided your temper ament is suff iciently energiz ed to enable you to ta ke adv antage of t hem, y ou will, by means of the normal channels , achiev e prosperity - the normal channels bein g sound judgment , adequate skill, and hard wo rk over a prolonged period. If you thi nk to acquire anything in hea ven, earth, or the Qliphotic waters under the earth by other channels than these, ta lisman ic mag ic will prove of no mo re use th an ap peals to rich relations. Talismanic work will giv e you en ergy, as can be readil y understood in the lig ht of the psy chology of au to-sug gestion; it will also gi ve you opportunity , as can only be understood in the lig ht of the occult hypotheses, but it cannot enable you to a vail yourself of that opportunity by an y means sav e your o wn capacit ies. A talisman is lik e any apparatus for ph ysica l culture - t he dev eloper does not develop your muscles, it is your use of it that dev elops t hem."}]
