Those who have formed the impression they are suffering fromsome form of psychic attack should take note of this. In the end, isn't your ownprojection simply exaggerated into a dramatic scenario? For the ultimate answerto most of life's problems almost inevitably lies within oneself.Sometimes the little ‘self craves for attention at all costs, even attentionthat most people would think was unwelcome attention. Whatever you do, don'tdwell on the problem; stand back from it and give yourself space! Believe andput your trust in something much more positive, bigger, and better. There aresome practical steps that you can take to restore the balance in your life.Please consider the following:1. Sever all connections with the suspected originator(s) of the attack, in sofar as this is practical, e.g., if you are living with your attacker, in whichcase you should detach and distance yourself as much as you can, and vigorouslyassert your own will and don't give in to someone else.2. Keep away from drugs.3. Don't meditate while the episode continues. If you have a religious belief,concentrate on that; e.g., go to Holy Communion, or whatever, regularly, forexample.4. Keep to a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep and fresh air, and take physicalexercise.5. Find something positive to do, such as sports or gardening.6. Some counsellors or psychotherapists are sufficiently open-minded,knowledgeable, and experienced to help you with your problem. In any case,before taking that step, it is generally advisable to have a thorough physicalcheck up, which should be done anyway. The supposed “attack” may be a simplephysical malfunction."},{"pageContent":"> THEN AND NOW: DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES This book was written shortly after the beginning of a major change in the Westthat brought with it the recognition of the positive contribution psychology waslikely to make in the future. Written over sixty years ago, Dion Fortuneinevitably reflects many commonly held beliefs and attitudes of that time.Times have changed, but the underlying principles have not. “Psychic attack” isreally a form of bullying of one sort or another. It is the drive to dominate,if not crush, a person by invalidating that person—breaking his or her will. Itcan take many forms, such as sexual harassment, or political or religiouspersecution. It is generally an assault on free will by the assertion of“superior” power which, so far as the persecutor is concerned, is best carriedout in a controlled environment from which the “victim” cannot easily escape.Obvious environments would include the workplace; any close group, institutionsof one kind or another including schools, service units, prisons, cults andsects, the family even. As well as the victim's own mind.One solution, after weighing the pros and cons, is leaving that environment andthe “psychic bully” to his or her own devices. What such a person craves is themeans to exercise power over others. Once that is removed, he or she has failedand is no different from anyone else. The second Achilles heel of the“persecutor” is activated when he or she is not taken seriously. He or she mustbe taken seriously at all costs, otherwise the power is lost. To be laughed at,or not to be taken seriously, is to turn the tables on the bully. That it is allvery serious is the name of the silly negative game.However, it is needless to point out that walking away from an environment isnot always easy and, in doing so one may simply be exchanging one problem foranother. One should be able to appeal to higher authority, though a sympatheticresponse from human “superiors” or law enforcers cannot always be relied on. Athird solution is direct confrontation with the oppressor, as Dion Fortunerelates; a similar run-in of the sort described between East and Flash man inTom-Brown's Schooldays. And while that was physical confrontation, it is equallytrue to say that in the end all bullies are, at heart, cowards in whatevercontext.Negative thought-streams are not always easy to handle since they tend to beattuned and attracted to the weak spots in a person's psyche. Hence theparticular vulnerability of the inexperienced of either sex when confronted byan older and therefore seemingly more experienced “adept”.Without a modicum of self-confidence, or a firm trust in one's ability to handlethe situation using good judgement, one becomes a relatively easy target.However, we repeat, the ultimate solution is in the mind of the “victim”; untilthe weak spot attracting negative attention and thought-flows is eliminated orbalanced, the problem cannot be properly dealt with. Strength to bear with, riseabove, and overcome the negative influence can be obtained by sincerely andsilently invoking the Christ Force as the temporarily veiled aspect of one's ownHigher nature."},{"pageContent":"> OBJECTIVE PHENOMENA The world mood has swung, to some extent, from demons of the night and variouselementals, some of which are sadly missed, to corn circles, alien sightings,and abductions, UFOs, etc. However, poltergeists are still in evidence, thoughlargely linked to young girls approaching puberty. Similarly, hauntings—thelikely consequence of unresolved fragmented personalities “stuck” in the beyondand unable to proceed in the normal after-death sequence, still obsessed by aparticular habit pattern or event from which they seem powerless to ridthemselves."},{"pageContent":"> RECENT DEVELOPMENTS It must be pointed out that recent developments in quantum physics, namelyBell's Theorem, confirmed experimentally by John Clause (1978) and AlainAspect's team (1982) confirms the proposition that our world is supported by anunmediated invisible reality, which allows instantaneous communication fasterthan light. This interaction does not diminish with distance and links uplocations without crossing space.This reinforces the reality of thought transfer (ESP) from one person toanother. The ability to concentrate is a key factor in this though, and with thepresent level of mind and will development, that is probably a somewhat raretalent.The use of such a technique negatively is unlikely to be successful wheredistance is involved. Again the key to disengaging oneself from this kind ofinvolvement consists in severing all mental, emotional and physical links, sofar as is possible. In extreme emergency one should sincerely invoke the HigherPowers in the form of the Christ Force.Here is a formula you can use to calm yourself when unduly stressed. Use it inprivate! Face the East, visualising yourself standing in the Sign of Stabilityand raise your right hand in the Sign of Evocation, saying:> By the Power of the Christ within me Whom I serve... Make the Sign of the Cross on the breast and forehead.> with all my heart and with all my soul and with all my strength... Draw a Circle of Protection right round you, using the pointed index finger ofyour right hand, now saying:> I encompass myself about with Divine Circle of His protection, across which no> error may set foot.

It is with a sense of the seriousness of the issues involved that I set myselfto the task of writing a book on psychic attack and the best methods of defenceagainst it. The undertaking is beset with pitfalls. It is hardly possible togive practical information on the methods of psychic defence without at the sametime giving practical information on the methods of psychic attack. It is notwithout reason that initiates have always guarded their secret science behindclosed doors. To disclose sufficient to be adequate without disclosingsufficient to be dangerous is my problem. But as so much has already been madeknown concerning the esoteric teachings, and as the circle of students of theoccult is becoming rapidly wider every day, it may well be that the time has nowcome for plain speaking. The task is not of my seeking, but as it has come intomy hands, I will do my best to discharge it honourably, making available theknowledge which has come to me in the course of many years' experience of thestrange by-ways of the mind which the mystic shares with the lunatic. Thisknowledge has not been attained without cost, nor, I suspect, will the divulgingof it be altogether free from cost, either.I have endeavoured to avoid, as far as possible, the use of second-handmaterial. We all know the person who has a friend whose friend saw the ghostwith her own eyes. That is not of very much use to anybody. What we need is tohave the eye-witness under cross-examination. For this reason I have not drawnupon the vast literature of the subject for illustrations of my thesis, but havepreferred to rely upon cases that have come within the range of my ownexperience and which I have been able to examine.I think I may fairly claim to have practical, and not merely theoretical,qualifications for the task. My attention was first turned to psychology, andsubsequently to occultism as the real key to psychology, by the personalexperience of a psychic attack which left me with shattered health for aconsiderable period. I know for myself the peculiar horror of such anexperience, its insidiousness, its potency, and its disastrous effects on mindand body.It is not easy to get people to come forward and bear witness to psychicattacks. First, because they know there is very little likelihood of their beingbelieved, and that they will be more likely to earn themselves a reputation formental unbalance than for anything else. Secondly, because any tampering withthe foundations of the personality is an experience of such peculiar and uniquehorror that the mind shrinks from the contemplation of it and one cannot talkabout it.I am of the opinion that psychic attacks are far commoner than is generallyrealised, even by occultists themselves. Certainly the general public has noconception at all of the sort of things that are done by people who have aknowledge of the powers of the human mind and set to work to exploit them. I amconvinced that this factor played a large part in the witch-cult, and was thereal cause of the universal horror and detestation of the witch. These powershave always been known to students of occultism, but nowadays they are known andused by people who would be exceedingly surprised to find who are their fellowpractitioners. Mrs. Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, stumbled on to thesemethods empirically without ever acquiring any rational knowledge as to theirmodus operandi. She endeavoured to teach them in such a way that they could onlybe used for good and their power for evil should be concealed; but that sheherself was well aware of their possibilities if abused is witnessed by thedread of what she called “Malicious Animal Magnetism” which shadowed her wholelife.The methods of Christian Science, without its strict discipline and carefulorganisation, were developed and exploited by the innumerable schools and sectsof the New Thought Movement. In many of the developments the religious aspectwas lost sight of, and they simply became a method of mental manipulation forpurely personal ends, though not necessarily deliberately evil. Their exponentsadvertised that they would teach the art of salesmanship, of making oneselfpopular and dominant in society, of attracting the opposite sex, of drawing tooneself money and success. The amazing number of these courses advertised showstheir popularity; in a recent issue of an American magazine I countedadvertisements for sixty-three different courses in various forms of mind-power.They would not be so popular if they achieved no results at all.Let us consider some of these advertisements and see what they indicate, readingbetween the lines and drawing our own conclusions.“Transfer your thoughts to others. Send for free folder. Telepathy, or MentalRadio.”“Troubled-health, love, money? Let me help you. No failures, instructions beingfollowed. Strictly personal and professional. Careful as family physician. Fivedollars must accompany enquiry. Money back if not satisfied.”“What do you want? Whatever it is, we can help you to get it! Just give us thechance by writing for ‘Clouds Dispelled.’ Absolutely free. You will bedelighted.”“HYPNOTISM. Would you possess that strange mysterious power which charms andfascinates men and women, influences their thoughts, controls their desires andmakes you supreme master of every situation? Life is full of alluringpossibilities for those who master the secrets of hypnotic influence, for thosewho develop their magnetic powers. You can learn at home, cure diseases and badhabits without drugs, win the friendship and love of others, increase yourincome, gratify your ambitions, drive worry and trouble from your mind, improveyour memory, overcome domestic difficulties, give the most thrillingentertainment ever witnessed and develop a wonderfully magnetic will-power thatwill enable you to overcome all obstacles to your success.”“You can hypnotise people instantly - quick as a flash - put yourself or anyoneelse to sleep at any hour of the day or night, or banish pain and suffering. Ourfree book tells you the secrets of this wonderful science. It explains exactlyhow you can use this power to better your condition in life. It isenthusiastically endorsed by ministers of the gospel, lawyers, doctors, businessmen and society women. It benefits everybody. It costs nothing. We give it awayto advertise our institution.”These are a few specimens chosen from among the sixty-three similaradvertisements counted in this single issue of a popular weekly magazine. Theyare given in extenso, in no way edited save by the omission of addresses.Let us now consider what such advertisements as these signify from the point ofview of the persons to whom they are not addressed, the persons over whom thereader is presumed to want to acquire power. What will be their position shouldhe break the tenth commandment and covet his neighbour's wife, or his ox, or hisass, or any of his other valuables? Supposing the diligent student of thesemethods wants something he ought not to have? Supposing he is on the shady sideof the law? Or is nursing a sense of injury and desires to be revenged? Ormerely loves power for its own sake? What is the fate of the cannon fodder thatsupplies the student of mind-power with the material for his experiments? Whatdoes it feel like to be dominated by these methods, and what results mayultimately be obtained by a competent experimenter?Let me give my own experience, painful though it is, for someone has got to bethe first to come forward and uncover these abuses which are only able toflourish because of the general failure to realise their significance.As a young girl of twenty I entered the employment of a woman who I now knowmust have had a considerable knowledge of occultism obtained during a longresidence in India, and concerning which she used to drop hints that I couldmake nothing of at the time, but which, in the light of later knowledge, I havecome to understand. It was her custom to control her staff by means of herknowledge of mind-power, and she had a steady succession of most peculiarbreakdowns among the people working under her.I had not been with her very long when she wanted me to give evidence in alawsuit. She was a woman of violent temper, and had dismissed an employeewithout notice and without wages, and he was suing her for the money due to him.She wanted me to say that his behaviour had been such that she was justified inthus dismissing him. Her method of collecting my evidence was to look into myeyes with a concentrated gaze and say, “Such and such things happened.”Fortunately for all concerned I had kept a diary and had a day-to-day record ofthe whole transaction. If it had not been for this I should not have known whereI was. At the end of the interview I was dazed and exhausted, and lay down on mybed in my clothes and slept the sleep of utter exhaustion till the next morning.I suppose I slept for about fifteen hours.Soon after this she wanted my testimony again. She wished to get rid of myimmediate superior, and wanted to find sufficient grounds to justify her indoing so. She repeated her previous manoeuvres, but this time I had not got adiary record to fall back upon, and to my intense surprise I found myselfagreeing with her in a series of entirely baseless charges against the characterof a man I had no reason to believe to be otherwise than perfectly straight. Thesame exhaustion and the same dead sleep descended upon me immediately after thisinterview as after the preceding one, but an additional symptom now manifesteditself. As I walked out of the room at the end of the interview I had a curioussensation as if my feet were not in the place I expected them to be. Anyone whohas walked across a carpet that is bellying up with the under-floor draught willknow what I mean. Occultists will recognise it as having to do with theextrusion of the etheric double.The next incident to occur in this curious menage did not concern myself, butanother girl, an orphan with considerable means. My employer kept this girlconstantly with her, and finally persuaded her to put the whole of her capitalinto her schemes. However, trustees descended in wrath, forced my employer todisgorge, and took the girl away with them then and there, leaving all herbelongings behind, to be packed up and sent on to her afterwards.Another incident followed quick on the heels of this one. There was an elderlywoman in the establishment who was slightly “minus” mentally. A dear old thing,but childlike and eccentric. My employer now turned her attention to her, and wewatched the same process of domination beginning. In this case there were notrustees to interfere, and the poor old lady was being persuaded to take heraffairs out of the hands of her brother, who had hitherto managed them, andcommit them to the tender mercies of my employer. My suspicions had by now beenthoroughly aroused. It was more than I could bear to see old “Auntie” rooked, soI took a hand in the game, woke “Auntie” up to the situation, pushed herbelongings into a box, and got her off to her relatives while my employer wasaway for a brief absence.I hoped my complicity in the affair would not become known, but I was soondisillusioned. My employer's secretary came to my room one night, after “lightsout,” and warned me that the Warden, as we called our employer, had found outwho it was that had engineered “Auntie's” escape, and I had better look out fortrouble. Knowing her to be of an exceedingly revengeful nature, I knew that mybest refuge was flight, but flight was not altogether easy to achieve. Theinstitution in which I was employed was an educational one, and a term's noticehad to be given before leaving. I did not look forward to working out that termunder the unchecked control of a spiteful woman. So I watched for an opportunitythat should justify me in walking out. With my employer's uncontrolled temper itwas not long to seek. I was up late the following night packing, in preparationfor my intended flight, when there came to my room another member of the staff,a girl who seldom spoke, had no friends, and went about her work like anautomaton. I had never had any dealings with her, and was more than surprised ather visit.It was soon explained, however.“You are going to leave ?” She said.I admitted that it was so.“Then go without seeing the Warden. You will not get away if you don't. I havetried several times, and I cannot get away.”However, I was young and confident in my untried strength, with no means ofgauging the forces arrayed against me, and next morning, dressed for the journeyand suitcase in hand, I went down and bearded my formidable employer in her den,determined to tell her what I thought of her and her methods, quite unsuspiciousthat anything save ordinary knavery and bullying was afoot.I was not allowed to get started with my carefully prepared speech, however. Assoon as she learnt that I was leaving, she said:“Very well, if you want to go, go you shall. But before you go you have got toadmit that you are incompetent and have no self-confidence.”To which I replied, being still full of fight, that if I were incompetent, whydid she not dismiss me herself, and anyway, I was the product of her owntraining-school. Which remark naturally did not improve matters.Then commenced a most extraordinary litany. She resumed her old trick of fixingme with an intent gaze, and said:“You are incompetent, and you know it. You have no self-confidence, and you havegot to admit it.”To which I replied, “That is not true. I know my work, and you know I know it.”Now there was no doubt that much could be said concerning my competency in myfirst post at the age of twenty, with a great deal of responsibility on myshoulders, and newly inducted into a disorganised department; but nothingwhatever could be said against my self-confidence, except that I had too much ofit. I was quite prepared to rush in where archangels would have hung back in thecollar.My employer did not argue or abuse me. She kept on with these two statements,repeated like the responses of a litany. I entered her room at ten o'clock, andI left it at two. She must have said these two phrases several hundreds oftimes. I entered it a strong and healthy girl. I left it a mental and physicalwreck and was ill for three years.Some instinct warned me that if I admitted I were incompetent and had noself-confidence my nerve would be broken, and I would never be good for anythingafterwards, and I recognised that this peculiar manoeuvre on the part of myemployer was an act of revenge. Why I did not pursue the obvious remedy oftaking refuge in flight, I do not know, but by the time one realises thatsomething abnormal is toward on these occasions, one is more or less glamoured,and just as the bird before the snake cannot use its wings, so one cannot moveor turn away.Gradually everything began to feel unreal. All I knew was that I had to hold onat all costs to the integrity of my soul. Once I agreed to her suggestions, Iwas done for. We went on with our litany.But I was getting near the end of my resources. I had a curious sensation as ifmy field of vision were narrowing. This, I believe, is a characteristicphenomenon of hysteria. Out of the corners of my eyes I could see two walls ofdarkness creeping up behind me on either side, as if one stood with one's backto the angle of a screen, and it were being slowly closed upon one. I knew thatwhen those two walls of darkness met, I should be broken.Then a curious thing happened. I distinctly heard an inner voice say:“Pretend you are beaten before you really are. Then she will let up the attackand you will be able to get away.” What this voice was, I have never known.I immediately followed its advice. With my tongue in my cheek I asked myemployer's pardon for everything I had ever done or ever should do. I promisedto remain on in my post and to go softly all the days of my life. I remember Iwent down on my knees to her, and she purred complacently over me, wellsatisfied with the morning's work, as she had every reason to be.Then she let me go, and I went up to my room and lay down on the bed. But Icould not rest until I had written her a letter. What that letter contained, Ido not know. As soon as I had written it and put it where she would get it, Ifell into a sort of stupor, and lay in this state with my mind completely inabeyance till the following evening. That is to say, from two o'clock oneafternoon till about eight o'clock of the following day - thirty hours. It was acold spring day with snow on the ground. A window close to the head of the bedwas wide open and the room unheated. I had no covering over me, but I feltneither cold nor hunger, and all the processes of the body were in abeyance. Inever stirred. Heartbeat and respiration were very slow, and continued so forseveral days.I was found eventually by the housekeeper, who revived me by the simpleapplication of a good shaking and a cold sponge. I was dazed, and disinclined tomove or even to eat. I was left to lie in bed, my work taking care of itself,the housekeeper coming to look at me from time to time, but making no comment onmy condition. My employer never showed herself.After about three days my especial friend, who thought I had left the house,learnt of my continued presence, and came along to see me; an act requiring somecourage, for our mutual employer was a formidable antagonist. She asked me whathad happened at my interview with the Warden, but I could not tell her. My mindwas a blank and all memory of that interview had gone as if a sponge had beenpassed over a slate. All I know was that out of the depths of my mind a mostterrible state of fear was rising up and obsessing me. Not fear of any thing orperson; just plain fear without an object, but none the less terrible for that.I lay in bed with all the physical symptoms of intense fear. Dry mouth, sweatingpalms, thumping heart and shallow, hasty breathing. My heart was beating so hardthat at each beat a loose brass knob on the bedstead rattled. Fortunately forme, my friend saw that something was seriously wrong and she sent for my family,who fetched me away. They were exceedingly suspicious. The Warden wasexceedingly uncomfortable, but no one could prove anything, so nothing was said.My mind was a blank. I was thoroughly cowed and very exhausted, and my onedesire was to get away.I did not recover, however, as had been expected. The intensity of the symptomswore off, but I continued to be exceedingly easily tired, as if I had beendrained of ail my vitality. I knew that, somewhere at the back of my mind, washidden the memory of a terrible experience, and I dared not think of it, becauseif I did, the shock and strain would be so severe that my mind would give wayaltogether. My chief consolation was an old school arithmetic book, and I usedto spend hour upon hour doing simple sums to keep my mind from racing itself topieces in wondering what had been done to me and sidling up towards the memory,and then shying away from it like a frightened horse. Finally I gained somemeasure of peace by coming to the conclusion that I had simply had a breakdownfrom overwork, and that the whole queer transaction was the fruit of myimagination. And yet there was a lingering feeling that it was real, and thisfeeling would not let me rest.About a year after the incident, my health still being very poor, I went away tothe country to recuperate, and there came across a friend who had been on thespot at the time of my breakdown. It had apparently caused a good deal of talk,and I found here one who was not inclined to explain away my experience, butasked pertinent questions. Another new friend became interested in my case andhauled me off to the family doctor, who bluntly gave it as his opinion that Ihad been hypnotised. It was before the days of psycho-therapy, and hisministrations to a mind diseased were limited to patting me on the back andgiving me a tonic and bromide. The tonic was useful, but the bromide was not, asit lowered my powers of resistance, and I speedily discarded it, preferring toput up with my discomfort rather than to render myself defenceless. For all thetime I was obsessed by the fear that this strange force, which had been appliedto me so effectually, would be applied again. But although I feared thismysterious power, which I now realised was abroad in the world, I cannot tellwhat a relief it was to me to find that the whole transaction was not anhallucination, but an actual fact that one could rise up and cope with.I obtained my release from the bondage of this fear by facing the wholesituation and determining to find out exactly what had been done to me and how Icould protect myself against a repetition of the experience. It was anexceedingly unpleasant process, in fact, the reaction caused by recovering thelost memories was only a little less violent than the original one; but Ifinally succeeded in freeing myself from my hag-ridden condition of fear,although it was a very long time before my physical health became normal. Mybody was like an electric battery that had been completely discharged”. It tooka long time to charge up again, and every time it was used before the chargingwas completed, it ran down again rapidly. For a long time I had no reserves ofenergy, and after the least exertion would fall into a dead sleep at any hour ofthe day. In the language of occultism, the etheric double had been damaged, andleaked prana. It did not become normal until I took initiation into the occultorder in which I subsequently trained. Within an hour of the ceremony I felt achange, and it is only upon the rarest occasions since then, after some psychicinjury, that I have had a temporary return of those depleting attacks ofexhaustion.I have told this story in detail because it is a useful illustration of themanner in which the little-known powers of the mind can be abused by anunscrupulous person. First-hand experience is of far more value than any amountof illustration from the pages of history, however well authenticated.If such a transaction had taken place during the Middle Ages, the parish priestwould have organised a witch-hunt. In the light of my own experiences, I am notat all surprised that people who had acquired a reputation for the practice ofwitchcraft were lynched, the methods are so terrible and so intangible. We maythink the records of the witch-trials are ridiculous, with their tales of waximages melting in front of slow fires, or the crucifying of christened toads, orthe reciting of little jingles, such as “Horse, hat tock, To ride, to ride.” Butif we understand the use of mind power we soon realise that these things weresimply aids to concentration. There is no essential difference between stickingpins into a wax image of an enemy and burning candles in front of a wax image ofthe Virgin. You may think that both these practices are gross superstition, butyou can hardly think that one is real and potent and deny reality and potency tothe other “The weapons of our warfare are not carnal” may as truly be said ofthe practitioners of Black Magic as of the Church.My own case belongs more to the realm of psychology than to occultism, themethod employed being an application of hypnotic power to improper ends; I havegiven it, however, because I am convinced that hypnotic methods are very largelyused in Black Magic, and that telepathic suggestion is the key to a largeproportion of its phenomena. I cite my own case, painful as it is to me to doso, because an ounce of experience is worth a pound of theory. It was thisexperience which led me to take up the study of analytical psychology, andsubsequently of occultism.As soon as I touched the deeper aspects of practical psychology and watched thedissection of the mind under psychoanalysis, I realised that there was very muchmore in the mind than was accounted for by the accepted psychological theories.I saw that we stood in the centre of a small circle of light thrown by accuratescientific knowledge, but around us was a vast, circumambient sphere ofdarkness, and in that darkness dim shapes were moving. It was in order tounderstand the hidden aspects of the mind that I originally took up the study ofoccultism.I have had my full share of the adventures of the Path; have known men and womenwho could indubitably be ranked as adepts; seen phenomena such as no séance roomhas ever known, and borne my share in it; taken part in psychic feuds, and stoodmy watch on the roster of the occult police force which, under the Masters ofthe Great White Lodge, keeps guard over the nations, each according to its race;kept the occult vigil when one dare not sleep while the sun is below thehorizon; and hung on desperately, matching my staying-power against the attackuntil the moon-tides changed and the force of the onslaught blew itself out.And through all these experiences I was learning to interpret occultism in thelight of psychology, and psychology in the light of occultism, the onecounterchecking and explaining the other.Because of my specialised knowledge, people came to me when an occult attack wassuspected, and their experience reinforces and supplements my own. Moreover,there is a considerable literature on the subject to be found in quarters whereone would least expect it—in accounts of folklore and ethnology, in the StateRecords of witch trials, and even under the guise of fiction. These independentrecords, by people in no way interested in psychic phenomena, confirm thestatements made by those who have experienced occult attacks.On the other hand, we have to distinguish very carefully between psychicexperience and subjective hallucination; we have to be sute that the person whocomplains of a psychic assault is not hearing the reverberation of his owndissociated complexes. The differential diagnosis between hysteria, insanity andpsychic attack is an exceedingly delicate and difficult operation, for sofrequently a case is not clear-cut, more than one element being present; asevere psychic attack causing a mental breakdown, and a mental breakdown layingits victim open to invasion from the Unseen. All these factors have to be bornein mind when investigating an alleged occult attack, and it shall be my task inthese pages not only to indicate the methods of occult defence, but also to showthe methods of differential diagnosis.It is very necessary, with so much occult knowledge about, that people shouldknow an occult attack when they see it. These things are much more common thanis generally realised. The recent tragedy in Iona gives point to this assertion.No occultist is under any illusion as to that death being from natural causes.In my own experience I have known of similar deaths.In my novel, The Secrets of Dr. Taverner, there were presented, under the guiseof fiction, a number of cases illustrative of the hypotheses of occult science.Some of these stories were built up to show the operation of the invisibleforces; others were drawn from actual cases; and some of these were written downrather than written up in order to render them readable by the general public.So much first-hand experience, confirmed by independent evidence, should not gounregarded, especially since rational explanations are difficult to find save interms of the occult hypotheses. It may be possible to explain away eachindividual case mentioned in these pages by alleging hallucination, fraud,hysteria, or plain lying, but it is not possible to explain the sum-total ofthem in this way. There cannot be so much smoke without some fire. It is notpossible that the prestige of the magician in antiquity and the dread of thewitch in the Middle Ages could have arisen without some basis in experience. Thevapourings of the wise woman would be no more heeded than those of the villageidiot if no painful consequences had ever been found to follow upon them. Fearwas the motive of these persecutions, and fear founded upon bitter experience;for it was not officialdom which incited the witch-burnings, but whole countrysides that rose up for a lynching. The universal horror of the witch must havesome cause behind it.The labyrinthine windings of the Left-hand Path are as extensive as they aredevious; but while exposing them in something, at any rate, of their horror, Istill maintain that the Right-hand Path of initiation and occult knowledge is away to the loftiest mystical experiences and a means of lifting the burden ofhuman suffering. Not every student of this knowledge necessarily abuses it;there are many, nay, the great majority, who hold it selflessly in trust formankind, using it to heal and bless and redeem that which is lost. It may wellbe asked: If this knowledge can be so disastrously abused, why should its veilever be lifted? What answer is made to this question is a matter of temperament.Some will maintain that knowledge of whatever kind cannot be without its value.Others may say we had better let sleeping dogs lie. The trouble is, however,that sleeping dogs have an unfortunate knack of waking up spontaneously. So muchoccult knowledge is abroad in the world, so much of the kind of things describedin these pages is going on unknown and unsuspected in our midst, that it is verydesirable that men of goodwill should investigate the forces which men of evilwill have perverted to their own ends. These things are the pathologies of themystic life, and if they were better understood, many tragedies might beaverted.On the other hand, it is not well that everybody should indulge in the study oftextbooks of pathology. A vivid imagination and a weak head are a disastrouscombination. The readers of that onetime “best seller,” Three Men in Boat, mayremember the fate of the individual who spent a wet Sunday afternoon reading amedical textbook. At the finish he was firmly convinced he had got every singledisease described therein with the single exception of housemaid's knee.This book is not intended merely to make the flesh creep, but is designed as aserious contribution to a little-understood aspect of abnormal psychology,perverted, in some instances, to the purposes of crime. It is a book intendedfor serious students and for those who find themselves confronted by theproblems it describes, and who are trying to understand them and find a way out.My chief aim in speaking so frankly is to open the eyes of men and women to thenature of the forces that are at work below the surface of everyday life. It mayhappen to any one of us to break through the thin crust of normality and findourselves face to face with these forces. Reading of the cases cited in thisbook, we may well say that there, but for the grace of God, goes any one of us.If I can give in these pages the knowledge which protects, I shall havefulfilled my purpose."},{"pageContent":"> PART I> TYPES OF PSYCHIC ATTACK "},{"pageContent":"> 1 SIGNS OF PSYCHIC ATTACK > The mind-side of nature Image [images/00004.jpg] The Unseen not necessarily> evil Image [images/00004.jpg] Causes of the rending of the veil Image> [images/00004.jpg] Signs of psychic attack Image [images/00004.jpg] Fear and> oppression Image [images/00004.jpg] Nightmares Image [images/00004.jpg]> Hypnagogic visions between sleeping and waking Image [images/00004.jpg]> Nervous exhaustion Image [images/00004.jpg] Wasting and loss of strength Image> [images/00004.jpg] Changes of temperament Image [images/00004.jpg] Projection> of thought-forms Image [images/00004.jpg] Materialisations Image> [images/00004.jpg] Hauntings Image [images/00004.jpg] Vampirism Image> [images/00004.jpg] Repercussion Image [images/00004.jpg] Evil odours Image> [images/00004.jpg] Precipitation of slime Image [images/00004.jpg] Phantom> footprints Image [images/00004.jpg] The astral bell Image [images/00004.jpg]> Poltergeist phenomena Image [images/00004.jpg] Outbreaks of fire Image> [images/00004.jpg] Necessary to consider: (a) Possibility of a natural> explanation, (b) Deliberate fraud Image [images/00004.jpg] An open mind> essential. IF WE LOOK AT the universe around us we cannot fail to realise that there mustbe some overruling plan coordinating its infinite complexity. If we take intoour hands and examine minutely any living thing, however simple, equally must werealise that the order of its parts is built up on a determining framework.Science has sought in vain for this organising principle; it will never find iton the physical plane, for it is not physical. It is not the inherent nature ofatoms which causes them to arrange themselves in the complex patterns of livingtissues. The driving forces of the universe, the framework upon which it isbuilt up in all its parts, belong to another phase of manifestation than ourphysical plane, having other dimensions than the three to which we arehabituated, and perceived by other modes of consciousness than those to which weare accustomed.We live in the midst of invisible forces whose effects alone we perceive. Wemove among invisible forms whose actions we very often do not perceive at all,though we may be profoundly affected by them.In this mind-side of nature, invisible to our senses, intangible to ourinstruments of precision, many things can happen that are not without their echoon the physical plane. There are beings that live in this invisible world asfish live in the sea. There are men and women with trained minds, or specialaptitudes, who can enter into this invisible world as a diver descends to theocean-bed. There are also times when, as happens to a land when the sea-dykesbreak, the invisible forces flow in upon us and swamp our lives.Normally this does not occur. We are protected by our very incapacity toperceive these invisible forces. There are four conditions, however, in whichthe veil may be rent and we may meet the Unseen. We may find ourselves in aplace where these forces are concentrated. We may meet people who are handlingthese forces. We may ourselves go out to meet the Unseen, led by our interest init, and get out of our depth before we know where we are; or we may fall victimto certain pathological conditions which rend the veil.The Threshold of the Unseen is a treacherous coast on which to bathe. There arepotholes and currents and quick sands. The strong swimmer, who knows the coast,may venture in comparative safety. The non-swimmer, who takes counsel of nothingbut his own impulses, may pay for his temerity with his life. But we must notmake the mistake of thinking that these invisible forces are necessarily eviland inimical to humanity. They are no more inimical in themselves than are wateror fire, but they are potent. If we run counter to them, the result isdisastrous for us, for we have broken a natural law; but they are not out toattack us, any more than we are out to attack them. We must face the fact,however, that men and women with knowledge of these things, have, both in thepast and in the present, used that knowledge unscrupulously, and that we mayfind ourselves involved in the results of their actions. It may safely be saidthat the Unseen is only evil and inimical to humanity when it has been corruptedand perverted by the activities of these unscrupulous men and women, whominitiates call adepts of the Left-hand Path.We must consider the outward and visible signs of psychic attack before we arein a position to analyse the nature of such attacks and indicate their source oforigin. It is a fundamental rule that diagnosis must precede treatment. Thereare many different kinds of psychic attacks, and the methods that will disposeof one will be ineffectual against another.The commonest form of psychic attack is that which proceeds from the ignorant ormalignant mind of our fellow human beings. We say ignorant as well as malignant,for all attacks are not deliberately motived; the injury may be as accidental asthat inflicted by a skidding car. This must always be borne in mind, and weshould not impute malice or wickedness as a matter of course when we feel we arebeing victimised. Out persecutor may himself be a victim. We should not accuse aman of malice if we had linked hands with him and he had stepped on a live rail.Nevertheless, we should receive at his hands a severe shock. So it may be withmany an occult attack. The person from whom it emanates may not have originatedit. Therefore, we should never respond to attack by attack, thus bringingourselves down to the moral level of our attackers, but rely upon more humanemethods, which are, in reality, equally effectual and far less dangerous tohandle.People also come into touch with the Unseen through the influence of places.Someone who is not actually psychic, but who is sufficiently sensitive toperceive the invisible forces subconsciously, may go to a place where they areconcentrated at a high tension. Normally, although we move in the midst of theseforces (for they sustain our universe), we are oblivious of them. Where they areconcentrated, however, unless we are very dense-minded, we begin to be dimlyconscious of something that is affecting us and stirring our subliminal self.It may happen that the barrier between consciousness and sub consciousness isdense in some people, and they are never able clearly to realise what is goingon. They merely have the sense of oppression and general malaise, which liftswhen they go away to another place. Consequently, the condition may never bedetected, and lead to years of ill-health and misery.More commonly, however, if there is a definite psychic attack of sufficientforce to make itself noticeable at all, there will soon begin to appearcharacteristic dreams. These may include a sense of weight upon the chest, as ifsomeone were kneeling on the sleeper. If the sense of weight is present, it iscertain that the attack emanates locally, for the weight is due to theconcentration of etheric substance or ectoplasm, and is sufficiently tangible topress down the scale of a balance when it is possible to capture it formeasurement. A great deal of research has been done with materialising mediumsupon the nature of this tangible subtle substance, and the reader is referred tothe books on the experiments conducted by Crawford with the Goligher Circle atBelfast, and in Paris with Eva C. by other experimenters, for furtherinformation and evidence on this subject. It may be noted that Crawfordeventually committed suicide for no known reason.A sense of fear and oppression is very characteristic of occult attack, and oneof the surest signs that herald it. It is extremely rare for an attack to makeitself manifest out of the blue, as it were. We are not in our normal state ofmind, body and circumstance, and then find ourselves suddenly in the midst of aninvisible battle. An approaching occult influence casts its shadow onconsciousness before it makes itself apparent to the non-psychic. The reason forthis is that we perceive subconsciously before we realise consciously, and aline of creeping shade indicates the penetrating of the subconscious censor frombelow upwards.As the attack progresses, nervous exhaustion becomes increasingly marked, andthere may, under certain conditions, which we will consider later, be suchwasting of the tissues that the victim is reduced to a mere bloodless shell ofskin and bones, lying on the bed, too weak to move. And yet no definite diseasecan be demonstrated.Such a case is an extreme example, proceeding unchecked to its logicalconclusion. Other issues are possible, however. The resistance may be good, inwhich case the attack is unable to gain a foothold on the physical plane, and islimited to that borderland between matter and mind which we perceive upon thethreshold of sleep. This is a very terrible experience, for the victim is afraidto sleep and cannot keep awake indefinitely. Worn out by fear and lack of sleep,mental breakdown soon supervenes.Nervous exhaustion and mental breakdown are the commoner results of astralattack among white people, for in Europe, at any rate, it is not often that anattacker is able to bring the attack to a conclusion in the death of the victim.There are, however, records of cases where the victim has died of pure fright.Kipling's terrible story, The End of the Passage, gives an account of such anoccurrence.But in addition to the purely subjective phenomena, there will also be objectiveones if the attack has any degree of concentration. The phenomenon ofrepercussion is well known, the phenomenon wherein that which befalls the subtlebody is reflected in the dense body, so that after an astral skirmish duringsleep, bruises are found on the physical body, sometimes bruises of a definitepattern. I have seen the print of a goat's hoof and the ace of clubs marked uponthe skin as well-defined bruises, passing from blue to yellow and dying away inthe course of a few days, as bruises will.Evil odours are another manifestation of an astral attack. The characteristicsmell is of decomposing flesh, and it comes and goes capriciously; but while itis manifesting, there is no doubt whatever about it, and anyone who is presentcan smell it, whether they are psychic or not. I have also known a frightfulstench of drains arise when a ritual belonging to the Element of Earth was beingincorrectly performed.Another curious phenomenon is the precipitation of slime. I have not actuallyseen this myself, but I have first-hand information upon good authority of onesuch case. The marks are sometimes as if an army of slugs had been marching inordered formation; sometimes there is a broad smear of slime, and at others,distinct footprints, often of gigantic size. In the case to which I refer, ofwhich I heard from an eyewitness, the marks were like the footprints of anelephant, enormous tracks on the floor of the drawing-room of a bungalowsituated near the sea.Odd footprints appearing from nowhere and leading nowhere, are sometimesobserved when there is snow about. I have seen them on two occasions on the roofof an outbuilding. They alighted upon the edge of it, as if the walker hadstepped off an aero plane, went straight across, and ended abruptly at the wallof the main building upon which the lean-to abuts. They did not return. A singleline of footprints came from nowhere and ended in a lofty wall.A similar happening took place on a very extensive scale in Devon some fiftyyears ago, and an account of it is to be found in that very curious book,Oddities, by Commander Gould. In this case, however, the prints were not human,but were those of what was apparently the hoof of a donkey, proceeding in asingle line and going straight through walls and over roofs and covering thebest part of a couple of hundred miles in a single night on both sides of anunbridged estuary. Those who want confirmatory evidence would do well to consultCommander Gould's book, where the incident is given in detail.There is a curious phenomenon known to occultists as the astral bell; Sir ArthurConan Doyle makes use of it in one of his Sherlock Holmes stories. This soundvaries from a clear, bell-like note to a faint click. I have often heard itresemble the sound made by striking a cracked wine-glass with a knife-blade. Itcommonly announces the advent of an entity that is barely able to manifest, andneed not necessarily be a herald of evil at all. It may simply be a knock on thedoor of the physical world to attract the attention of the inhabitants to thepresence of one who stands without and would speak with them. If, however, itoccurs in the presence of other symptoms of an astral attack, it would givestrong evidence in confirmation of the diagnosis.Inexplicable outbreaks of fire are also sometimes seen in this connection. Theseindicate that elemental forces, not human, are at work. Poltergeist phenomenaalso occur, in which objects are flung about, bells rung and other noisymanifestations take place. Of course, there may be multiplicity of phenomena,more than one type appearing in the same case.Needless to say, the possibility of some natural, material explanation mustnever be ignored, even in cases where the supernatural element appears mostobvious. It should always be diligently sought in every possible directionbefore any supernormal hypothesis is considered worthy of attention. But, on theother hand, we should not be so wedded to materialistic theories that we refuseto take a psychic theory as a working hypothesis if it shows any possibility ofbeing fruitful. After all, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and if,working on an occult hypothesis, we are able to clear up a case which hasresisted all other methods of handling, we have pretty good evidence in supportof our contention.We must also bear in mind that the element of deliberate fraud may enter intothe most unexpected places. I have seen a drug addict successfully pass himselfoff for a considerable length of time as the victim of an occult attack. Arecent writer in the British Medical journal declared that whenever he cameacross a case of bell-ringing, knocks, the dripping of water and oil fromceilings, and other untoward happenings, he always looked for the hystericalmaidservant. Occultists would be very well advised to do likewise before theybegin to worry about the Devil. But, on the other hand, the wise man, whetheroccultist or scientist, will not insist upon the hysterical maidservant unlesshe can catch her red-handed, as he surely will do sooner or later if she is theguilty party.Forged bank-notes would never gain currency unless there were such a thing asgenuine bank-notes. It would never occur to anyone to produce fraudulent psychicphenomena unless there had been some genuine psychic phenomena to act as apattern for the forgery.The acceptance of an explanation should rest upon the weight of evidence in itsfavour, not upon one's dislike of its alternatives. I plead that the possibilityof a non-material explanation should be investigated in cases where thematerialistic hypothesis does not yield results. Not in diseases of the brainand nervous system, nor of the ductless glands, nor in repression of the naturalinstincts, shall we find the explanation in all cases wherein the mind isafflicted. There is more to man than mind and body. We shall never find the clueto the riddle of life until we realise that man is a spiritual being and thatmind and body are the garments of his manifestation."},{"pageContent":"> 2 ANALYSIS OF THE NATURE OF PSYCHIC ATTACK > Telepathic suggestion the key to psychic attacks Image [images/00004.jpg]> Three types of suggestion: (a) Auto-suggestion; (b) Conscious suggestion; (c)> Hypnotic suggestion Image [images/00004.jpg] Suggestion must fit the> temperament Image [images/00004.jpg] Unsuspected depths Image> [images/00004.jpg] How a psychic attack operates Image [images/00004.jpg]> Cannot take effect until the aura is pierced Image [images/00004.jpg]> Reinforcement by evil entities Image [images/00004.jpg] Case of psychic attack> described Image [images/00004.jpg] Significance of nightmare Image> [images/00004.jpg] How to distinguish a psychic seizure from epilepsy Image> [images/00004.jpg] Correlation of attacks with phases of the moon Image> [images/00004.jpg] Psychic diagnosis of this cas Image [images/00004.jpg]> Confirmatory details elicited Image [images/00004.jpg] Course of case Image> [images/00004.jpg] Interpretation of events. THE ESSENCE OF A psychic attack is to be found in the principles and operationsof telepathic suggestion. If we put together what we know of telepathy and whatwe know of suggestion, we shall understand its modus operandi.Suggestion is of three kinds: Auto-suggestion, Conscious Suggestion and HypnoticSuggestion. The distinction, however, is not as fundamental as at first sightappears; for the goal of all suggestions in the subconscious mind is the same,and they do not become operative until it is reached. Suggestion isdistinguished from threats and appeals to reason by the fact that these aim at amark in the conscious mind. If they succeed, they owe their success to theacquiescence of the conscious personality, whether coerced or voluntary. Butsuggestion does not make its appeal to consciousness, but aims at laying itshands upon the springs of action in the sub consciousness and manipulating themfrom there.We might compare these two processes to the operation of pulling at thebell-knob outside the front door and taking up a floor-board and twitching thebell-wires themselves. The result will be the same in both cases, the bell willring. Threats and argument pull the bell-knob with varying degrees of emphasis,from the persistent tinkling of moral suasion to the resounding peal of theblackmailer Suggestion twitches the wires at various points in their course.Auto-suggestion is given by one's own conscious mind one's own subconsciousmind. Now, you may ask, why can I not give orders to my subconscious minddirect, without having to resort to the paraphernalia of suggestion? The answerto this question is very simple. The subconscious mind belongs to a much earlierphase of evolution than the conscious mind; belongs, in fact, to a phase priorto the development of speech. To address it in words, therefore, is likespeaking to a man in a language he does not understand. In order to deal withhim we must have resort to sign-language. So it is with the subconscious mind.It is no use to say to it, Do this: or, Don't do that. We must make a mentalpicture of the thing we want done and hold it in consciousness till it begins tosink into the subconsciousness. The subconscious mind will understand thispicture, and act upon it.The actor who wishes to cure himself of stage-fright, will fail to do so if hesay to his subconscious mind, “Don't be frightened,” for a nod is as good as awink to a blind horse. Equally, if he makes a mental picture of stage fright andsays to his subliminal self, “Now don't do that,” the result will be disastrous,for the subliminal self will see the picture and omit the negative, because theword “not” means nothing to it. In order to handle the subconscious mindeffectually, we make a mental picture of the thing we want done and hold it inmind by repeated applications until the subconscious begins to be influenced andtakes up the task of its own accord.This is the end result of all suggestion, and the different kinds of suggestionare distinguished, not by the difference in end result, but by the gate throughwhich they enter the subconscious mind. Auto-suggestion originates in our ownconsciousness; waking suggestion originates in the mind of another and isconveyed to our mind by the ordinary channels of the spoken or written word;hypnotic suggestion enters the subconscious mind direct, without impinging uponconsciousness at all.Hypnotic suggestion (which means, literally, suggestion made during sleep, andis to some extent a misnomer) is of three kinds: firstly, true hypnoticsuggestion, made when the subject has been rendered insensible by magneticpasses or fixation of the eyes on a bright object; secondly, suggestion givenduring normal sleep, as Coué advises should be done with children, in my opiniona most undesirable proceeding; and, thirdly, telepathic suggestion. All thesemodes of suggestion enter the mind behind the censor; that is to say, they areindependent of consciousness, which is neither asked to cooperate, nor has thepower to inhibit them.In most cases, suggestions made in this way are never recognised as coming fromoutside, but are only discovered after they have matured in the subconsciousnessand are beginning to take effect. We do not see the invisible seed, that hasbeen sown in our mind by the mind of another, but in due course germinationtakes place and the strong-growing shoot appears above the threshold ofconsciousness as if it were a native growth. The skilful suggestionist alwaysaims at making his suggestions harmonise with the bias of the personality; forif they do not, the established subconscious complexes will expel them beforethey have time to strike root. All he can really do is to reinforce andstimulate the ideas and impulses that are already there, though perhaps latent.He cannot plant an entirely alien seed. He cannot graft a rose shoot on a lilacbush, for it will merely wither and die.For growth of the thought-seeds of suggestion to take they must find a congenialsoil. It is herein lies the strength of the defence. We may not be able toprevent the minds of others from sending us suggestions, but we may so purifythe soil of our own natures that no harmful ones can find a congenial seed-bed.It is a simple matter to pull up a seedling nettle, but it is quite a differentbusiness to eradicate a thickset bank of tangled roots and stinging shoots, manyyears old.It has been said, and not untruly, that a person cannot be hypnotised into doinganything which is contrary to his real nature. But what is the real nature ofeach one of us? Have we all overcome the ape and tiger, or are they merelycaged? Suggestion can unbar the cage of all our secret temptations and let themloose upon us. None but the saint is naturally immune. It is possible to reduceanybody to anything provided suggestion has unchecked scope for a sufficientlength of time. The purest woman can be made a harlot, the noblest man amurderer under certain conditions. Knowledge is necessary to protect, and it isthat knowledge which I intend to give in these pages.Let us now consider exactly how a psychic attack operates. In the realms of mindthere is neither time nor space as we understand them. I do not propose to arguethis statement philosophically but state it as a fact of experience which anyonewho is accustomed to operating on the Inner Planes will have shared. If we thinkof a person, we are in touch with that person. If we picture them clearly, it isas if we were face to face with them. If we picture them vaguely, it is as if wesaw them in the distance. Being in the mental vicinity of a person, we cancreate a thought-atmosphere by dwelling upon certain ideas in connection withhim. This is how spiritual healing is done. The affirmations of ChristianScience are used in order to get the mind of the healer into a certain emotionalstate, and his condition effectually influences the mind of the patient withwhom he has put himself en rapport.This power, however, can be used for evil as well as good; the Founder ofChristian Science was wise enough to put her teaching in such a way that herstudents would not readily discern the second edge of the sword. As long as theworld in general was ignorant of the powers of the mind, it was better thatnothing should be said by those who knew, because the knowledge, if spreadabroad indiscriminately, might do more harm than good, giving information tothose who ought not to have it. But now that so much is generally known and evenpractised concerning the powers of the human mind, it is as well that the realfacts should also be known and the whole matter brought out into the open, andas far as lies in my power I am prepared to do this.Any message to the subconscious mind must be couched in very simple terms,because subconscious thought is a primitive form of mentation, developed beforespoken language was known to mankind. The primary aim of the suggestion is tocreate a mental atmosphere about the soul of the person, whether that person isto be attacked or healed, until a sympathetic response or reaction is elicitedwithin the soul itself. (I use the term soul to include both the mental andemotional processes, but to exclude the spiritual ones.) Once this reaction isachieved, the battle is half over, for the gate of the city has been opened fromwithin, and there is free ingress. The telepathic suggestion of definite ideascan now proceed rapidly.It is this point which is the critical one in any occult attack. Up to thispoint, the defender has the advantage. If he has sufficient knowledge, theknowledge I hope to make available through this book, he can without any undueexertion retain that advantage indefinitely, and wear his attackers down, evenif unable to meet them on their own ground of occult knowledge. There is nothingin this world or the next that a hypnotist can do with the person who keeps hisnerve and won't pay attention.There are two gates, and two only, by which the attacker can gain entrance tothe city of Man soul, and these are the Self-preservation Instinct and the SexInstinct. The hypnotic appeal must be couched in terms of one or both of theseif it is to be successful. How does the attacker proceed? He has to create anatmosphere about the soul of his victim on the Inner Planes. He can only do thisby creating that atmosphere within his own consciousness while he thinks of hisvictim. If he wants to perform a psychic murder, he must fill his own soul withthe rage of destruction until it overflows. If he wants to perform a psychicrape, he must fill his soul with lust and cruelty. The cold rage of cruelty isessential to effectual operations of this nature. Now what happens when he doesthis? He has sounded a ringing keynote in the Abyss. It will be answered. Allbeings who have this keynote for the basis of their nature will respond -” DarkUriel and Azrael and Ammon on the wing” - and will join in the operation. Butthey do not operate direct upon the victim, they work through the operator. Itis like the old game of Nuts and May, in which the one who is sent “to fetch heraway” is gripped round the waist by the leader of a chain of supporters. Thereal pressure comes on his own abdominal muscles, as anyone who has played thegame will remember.> And when the magical operation is over, what then? Will the operator be left> to enjoy his victim in peace? IS IT LIKELY? This is the mystical basis of the story of Faust. The Devil might be not onlywilling but anxious to enable Dr. Faustus to win Margarita, but he came for hissoul at the appointed time. We may also remember that if Margarita had notresponded to the lure of the Jewel Song she would not have fallen a victim. Theweak spot in the defence was after all in her own nature.We have considered the modus operandi of telepathic suggestion in detail becauseit forms the real basis of every kind of occult attack. Whether it be adiscarnate entity, a being of another order of evolution, a demon from the Pit,or merely the panic-stricken soul of a selfish friend, clinging to the life ofform regardless of consequences, in all cases the opening gambit is the same.Until the aura is pierced, there can be no entrance to the soul, and the aura isalways pierced from within by the response of fear or desire going out towardsthe attacking entity. It we can inhibit that instinctive emotional reaction, theedge of the aura will remain impenetrable, and will be as sure a defence againstpsychic invasion as the healthy and unbroken skin is a defence against bacterialinfection.It happens sometimes, however, that a rapport has been formed with the attackingentity in a previous incarnation, and therefore it holds, as it were, the key tothe postern. Such a problem is a very difficult one, and external assistance isneeded for its solution. The difficulty is increased by the fact that the victimis often disinclined to allow the break to be made, being bound to the attackingentity, whether discarnate or incarnate, by bonds of fascination, or evengenuine affection.A case with which I was acquainted throws so much light on various aspects ofpsychic interference by incarnate souls operating out of their bodies that it isof value to quote it at length.In the summer of 1926 I saw in the papers a short paragraph describing the deathof a certain man and his wife, which took place within a few hours of eachother. A couple of years previously I had been consulted by a friend of thewife, who was deeply perturbed about the state of affairs, and suspected psychicinterference. The wife, Mrs. C. we will call her, had begun to be troubled bynightmares, waking up in a state of intense fear, hearing the echoes of menacingwords ringing in her ears. At about the same time the husband, Mr. C, developedwhat at first sight looked like epileptic fits. A careful diagnosis byspecialists, however determined that although epileptiform, they were not trueepilepsy. Epilepsy is due either to a congenital tendency whose nature is notfully understood by medical science, or to some injury or disease of the brain.In congenital epilepsy the disease shows itself early in life; in fits due todisease, other symptoms are present which can be detected by a physicalexamination, such as changes in the eye that are revealed by the ophthalmoscope.The diagnosis can therefore be definitely established. Moreover, there is onesure sign by means of which an epileptic fit can be distinguished with certaintyfrom a hysterical or psychic seizure. In true epilepsy the urine isinvoluntarily voided in the course of the fit. This is a sure sign, and when itis absent we are safe in saying that the fit is not epileptic, whatever else itmay be. This is a useful point for those who have to deal with the pathologiesthat afflict the psychic temperament, for they will see plenty of seizures, anda sure method of distinguishing those that are of organic origin is very useful.We must not, however, conclude that all cases of such incontinence areepileptics, for there are many other causes, both organic and functional.In the case of Mr.C. this cardinal symptom was lacking. The attacks, moreover,always took place in sleep, and it seemed as if they were more of the form ofsevere nightmare, verging on somnambulism. It was a curious factor in the casethat Mrs. C.'s nightmares usually heralded Mr. C.'s attacks.These occurrences showed a certain cyclic regularity, occurring about once amonth. In the case of a woman this would naturally be referred to thetwenty-eight day cycle of her nature, but in the case of a man, no suchexplanation was forthcoming, and we therefore had to look for anothertwenty-eight day cycle to explain his periodicity. The only other cycle of thisperiod is that of the phases of the moon.We were then confronted by a correlation of epileptiform attacks, which had noorganic basis, the nightmares of a second person, and the phases of the moon.Some theory had to be found which would resume these three and explain theirinter-relationship.A dream is commonly the first way in which psychic manifestations makethemselves known, the subconscious perceptions being reflected intoconsciousness in this form.It is held by many occultists that congenital epilepsy, as distinguished fromthat due to tumours of the brain, has its roots in the operations of black magicor witchcraft in which the sufferer participated in a past life, whether aspractitioner or victim, the fit being an astral struggle with a discarnateentity, reflected on the physical body by means of the well-known phenomenon ofrepercussion.The moon plays a very important part in all occult operations, different tidesbeing available at different phases of her cycle. Persephone, Diana and Hecate,all aspects of Luna, are three very different persons.It therefore appeared probable that as the physical investigation had drawnblank, a psychic investigation might yield fruits. One was performed. And withthe following results. Nothing at all was discerned with regard to Mrs. C. Shewas merely what lawyers call an accessory after the fact. But the psychic trailof Mr. C. was soon picked up and followed, and it appeared that in his lastincarnation he had been associated with two women, mother and daughter, who hadpractised witchcraft for his benefit. The younger of the two women had been fora short rime his mistress. Mother and daughter had paid the penalty for theircrimes, but their male partner had escaped.The diagnosis was as follows: It is the younger witch that is at the bottom ofthe trouble. It is her astral visits which cause the seizures of Mr. C. and thenightmares of Mrs. C, and they correlate with the phases of the moon becausecertain phases ate favourable for the operation she performs and she thereforetakes advantage of them. The question now remains, is this woman in incarnationor not ? That is to say, is the midnight visit paid in an astral body projectedfrom a living human being, or by an earth-bound spirit which has succeeded inevading the Second Death?Mrs. C. had by now been taken into the confidence of their mutual friend who wasconcerned for her welfare, and lent a ready ear to the suggestion that somepsychic influence might be at the bottom of the trouble, for this explanationcoincided with her own intuitions in the matter, intuitions she had not dared todivulge for fear of ridicule.When asked if she could identify anyone in the circle of her husband'sacquaintances who might prove to be the younger witch, she replied immediatelythat she could without any difficulty, identify both the women, and told thefollowing curious story.The older witch she identified as her husband's mother, an aged lady whooccupied a suite of rooms in their house. For this inoffensive old creature Mrs.C. had always had a peculiar horror and repulsion, although admitting there wereno rational grounds for it, and honestly endeavouring to do her duty by her. Sogreat was her horror of the old lady that she would never remain in the houseafter her husband had left for his office in the morning, but went out herselfto her club if she had no other engagement.Among the frequenters of the house was an intimate friend of the elder Mrs. C, awoman of peculiar psychic temperament, who always called the old lady mother andwas singularly attached to her. She was also very attached to Mr. C, but herfeelings never exceeded, outwardly at any rate, the bounds of propriety, and Mr.C, who was sincerely attached to his own wife, never paid the slightestattention to her, looking upon her as his mother's friend, and as such to betolerated.Mrs. C. unhesitatingly identified Miss X., as we will call her, as the youngerwitch. Enquiries were then made regarding her history, and a very curious storyunfolded.As a young girl she had become engaged to a man who, soon after the engagementwas announced, had developed galloping consumption and died after a shortillness with a violent haemorrhage.Soon after this, Miss X's sister also became engaged, and by a strange fatalityher lover shared the same fate, dying as died the other man, in a flood of hisown blood.Years went by, and Miss X. became engaged again. Soon the second lover fell ill,not, this time, with galloping consumption, but with a more lingering form ofthe complaint, in which haemorrhage was the principle symptom. He seemed tolinger on from haemorrhage to haemorrhage, and this went on for years. Miss X.,a woman of considerable private means, took a house, installed an aunt as achaperone, and took her fiance to live there and be nursed by her. Soon the auntdeveloped symptoms of illness; she appeared to be drained of all vitality andfor days at a time would lie unconscious, but no specific cause was everdiscovered for her illness. This peculiar menage continued for years, Miss X.living in her big house with these two moribund creatures lingering on fromattack to attack.She was a constant visitor at the home of the C.'s, both during the lifetime ofMr. C.'s first wife and that of his second, the friend of my friend. On thedeath of Mr. C.'s first wife she had great hopes, it was observed, that hisattentions would turn towards herself, but they did not; nevertheless sheswallowed her chagrin, and succeeded in maintaining her foothold as an intimatefriend of the family when the new Mrs. C. came to preside over the household.Certain methods of protection were suggested to Mrs. C. which helped herconsiderably, but it was not possible to exclude Miss X. from the house owing toher intimacy with the old lady. In due course, however, old Mrs. C. was gatheredto her fathers, and then young Mrs. C. put her foot down and said she would haveno more to do with Miss X. Mr. C. concurred in this, as he had always had arepulsion for Miss X., and had only tolerated her for his mother's sake.Soon after this Mrs. C. began to feel unwell, the indisposition slowlyprogressed, until finally, although she had no definite symptoms, she wasobliged to consult a doctor on account of her steadily increasing weakness andsense of malaise. A diagnosis of rapidly growing cancer of the womb was made. Anoperation was performed, which gave temporary relief, it was not expected to doany more, and she went downhill steadily.Towards the end she lapsed into unconsciousness, and at the same time, Mr. C.also became unconscious, apparently having one of his seizures in sleep, fromwhich he never awakened. They died within a few hours of each other.Mr. C.'s first wife had also died of cancer of the womb.About this time Miss X.'s aunt and fiance died within short time of each other,and the last that was heard of Miss X. was that she had been removed to anursing-home in the country with a severe mental breakdown.Taken separately, any of the incidents in this strange, eventful history can beexplained away, but taken together they make a curious story, especially when itis remembered that without any previous information a psychic investigation had“spotted” the existence of a person with abnormal faculties who was interestedin Mr. C.Cancer is a disease upon which certain occult hypotheses throw a good deal oflight. It is believed to be a disease of the etheric double, not of the physicalbody, and that a “Cancer Elemental” is the infective factor.To prove or disprove anything concerning the foregoing story is impossible, butthe following occult hypothesis may explain much. If this hypothesis be notaccepted, readers may find an interesting exercise for their ingenuity inconstructing another that shall explain more satisfactorily the circumstances ofthe case.Miss X. retained subconsciously the knowledge and powers that had been hersduring the previous life when she was implicated in the witch-cult. She alsoretained her passion for Mr. C, a passion which was obviously unrequited. Sheemployed her power of projection of the astral body to visit Mr. C. at night,during sleep. In the absence of details it is impossible to decide definitelywhether the “fit” of Mr. C. was a struggle or an embrace. It might be either, orit might be both, an initial struggle ending in an embrace. The dreams of Mrs.C. obviously related to the same astral visitant who caused the seizures of Mr.C. There is, unfortunately, no record to show at what phase of the moon theseattacks took place, but presumably at the Hecate phase, which is the period ofevil witchcraft.The condition of Miss X.'s fiance and aunt and the death of her first loverpoint markedly towards vampirism. It is difficult to believe that a consumptivewould continue for so many years without his disease either being checked ormaking definite progress. It is difficult to say what the connection, if any,might be between Miss X. and the death of her sister's lover, but it is acurious thing that three men, associated with this ill-omened household asprospective husbands, should lose their lives in the same way. This, togetherwith the mysterious illness of the aunt, are very suspicious. As noted before,any one of these incidents could be explained away, but taken together they callfor thought. It is also curious that Miss X. should keep her fiance in her houseand yet not marry him, from every normal point of view an arrangement with manydrawbacks and no advantages. On the other hand, if her feelings were fixed uponMr. C. and were obtaining satisfaction by astral visits, she would naturally notwant to break her rapport with the man she loved by giving herself to the manshe did not love. If she were a vampire, her motive for keeping the aunt andlover in her house, and their condition, would be readily explained. Also herbreakdown, which followed immediately upon their deaths.The fact that Mr. C.'s first wife died of cancer of the womb does not in itselfcall for remark, but it is a curious thing that he should lose his second wifefrom the same disease. Cancer is not as common as all that, and in any case,there are many available sites beside the womb. On the other hand, Diana, one ofthe aspects of Luna, of whom Hecate, the goddess of witches, was another,presides over the female reproductive organs.The illness of Mrs. C. began to show itself soon after Miss X. was excluded fromthe house.Finally, what shall we say concerning the deaths of the three people mostintimately associated with Miss X. within a short time of each other, and herimmediate breakdown? In the absence of details any conclusion must be guesswork,but we have good grounds for supposing that Miss X.'s magical operations wereattended by some mishap.It may be said that such a theory is the wildest improbability and does violenceto all the laws of evidence. Let it, however, be borne in mind that two yearsbefore these matters eventuated, the work of a witch in connection with Mr. C.'sepileptiform attacks was suspected and the nature of her relationship to him wasindicated; and subsequent enquiries revealed the curious facts in connectionwith Miss X.'s history and menage; let it also be noted that the happeningswhich subsequently occurred are such as have been recorded in many accounts ofwitch-trials. It is a scientific maxim that the power to foretell the course ofphenomena is a good indication of the truth of a theory."},{"pageContent":"> 3 A CASE OF MODERN WITCHCRAFT > Effect of witchcraft in previous incarnations Image [images/00004.jpg] Case of> an occult attack by an ex-witch Image [images/00004.jpg] Antipathy of animals> to her Image [images/00004.jpg] Nightmares of the other occupants of the house> Image [images/00004.jpg] Psychic discernment of danger Image> [images/00004.jpg] Maniacal attack Image [images/00004.jpg] Method of handling> the case Image [images/00004.jpg] Use of pentagram Image [images/00004.jpg]> Its effect Image [images/00004.jpg] Incident of magnetised cross Image> [images/00004.jpg] Dread of sacred symbols Image [images/00004.jpg] Her> confession. THE PART PLAYED by the ex-witch in occult attack is very marked. Again and againdo the investigations of independent psychics point to witchcraft in a previousincarnation when trouble of this sort is afoot. The motive is nearly alwaysvengeance, but there is also good reason to believe that the projection of theastral body takes place involuntarily during sleep, and is not deliberatelywilled by the offender. Very many people who are at present psychics andsensitives got their training in the covens of mediaeval witchcraft, and forthis reason experienced occultists are very wary of the natural psychic, asdistinguished from the initiate with his technique of psychism. Where psychismand mental unbalance are found conjoined with a malevolent disposition, there isstrong presumption that the cult of Diabolus is not far to seek.A curious set of happenings, in which I myself was one of the actors, throws agood deal of light on this by no means uncommon occurrence. It was in the earlydays of my interest in occultism, when I was still buying my experience by theexpensive but effectual method of running my head into obstacles. I made theacquaintance of a woman who was interested in psychic matters. She was a personof the most extreme sensitiveness to anything unclean or ugly, fastidious to adegree in her personal habits, living almost exclusively on uncooked vegetarianfoods, even refusing eggs as too stimulating. Although not an animal lover, shewas morbidly humanitarian, reading with gusto those papers which give lurid anddetailed descriptions of vivisection experiments. Had I been older and wiser Ishould have recognised the significance of her ultra-cleanliness andultra-sensitiveness as marking the abreaction of a sadistic temperament - sadismbeing a pathology of the emotional nature in which the sex instinct takes theform of an impulse to inflict pain. Not having learnt then many things I nowknow, I looked upon her characteristic, as indicative of an exaltedspirituality.At the time I knew her she was verging on a breakdown which was alleged to bedue to overwork, and she was very anxious to get away from cities and back tonature. I was just leaving London to take up my residence at an occult collegewhich was hidden away in the sandy fastnesses of the Hampshire barrens. In theinnocence of my heart I suggested that she might come down there and help withthe domestic duties. The suggestion was acted upon, and a few days after my ownarrival Miss L. joined us. She seemed quite normal, made herself agreeable, andwas well liked. One incident, however, in the light of subsequent events, wassignificant. On getting out of the ancient fly in which she had driven from thestation, she immediately went and patted the still more ancient horse that drewit. That beast, usually sunk in all apathy from which he was with difficultyroused when action was required of him, galvanised into life at her touch as ifshe had stung him. He threw up his head, backed, snorted, and nearly turned theequipage over in the ditch, to the amazement of his jehu, who declared he hadnever been known to do such a thing before, and viewed our visitor withdisfavour.Miss L., however, appeared quite normal, made herself agreeable, and was given afriendly reception by the humans at any rate.That night I was awakened by nightmare, a thing to which I am not usuallysubject. I struggled with a weight on my chest, and even after consciousness hadfully returned, the room seemed full of evil. I performed such simple banishingformulae as I knew, and peace was restored.At breakfast next morning an assembly of blear-eyed people met together,complaining of having passed disturbed nights. We compared notes, and found wehad all, some six or seven of us, had similar nightmares, and proceeded toexchange experiences. The effect of this upon Miss L. was curious. She squirmedupon her chair as if it had suddenly become red-hot and said with much emphasis:“These things should not be discussed, it is most unwholesome.”Out of deference to her feelings we desisted. But presently up to the openwindow came another member of our community, a woman who slept in an open-airshelter at some little distance from the house. We enquired after her health, asusual, and she replied that she was not feeling very well, as she had sleptbadly, and proceeded to recount the same nightmare as the rest of us.Later on in the morning, another lady, who had a house a little way down theroad, arrived, and she in her turn told of a similar nightmare.These nightmares continued, on and off for the next few days, to afflictdifferent members of the community. They were vague and nebulous, and there wasnothing we could pitch upon for diagnostic purposes, and we put it down toindigestion caused by the village baker's version of war bread.Then one day I had a quarrel with Miss L. She had conceived a “crush” for me; Ihave a constitutional repulsion for crushes and give them scant politeness, andshe complained bitterly of my lack of responsiveness. Whatever may be the rightsand wrongs of the case, I had roused her resentment in good earnest. That nightI was afflicted with the most violent nightmare I have ever had in my life,waking from sleep with the terrible sense of oppression on my chest, as ifsomeone were holding me down, or lying upon me. I saw distinctly the head ofMiss L., reduced to the size of an orange, floating in the air at the foot of mybed, and snapping its teeth at me. It was the most malignant thing I have everseen.Still not attaching any psychic significance to my experiences, and being firmlyconvinced that the local baker was responsible, I told no one of my dream,thinking it one of those things that are better kept to oneself, but when themembers of the community came to talk matters over in the light of subsequentevents, we found that two other people had had similar experiences.A night or two later, however, as it came to bed-time, I was overcome with asense of impending evil, as if something dangerous were lurking in the bushesaround the house threatening attack. So strong was this sensation that I camedown from my room and went all round the house, testing the catches of thewindows to make sure that all was secure.Miss L. heard me, and called out to know what I was doing. I told her of myfeelings.“You silly child,” she said, “it is no use latching the windows, the danger isnot outside the house but in it. Go to bed, and be sure and lock your door.”She would give no answer to my questions except to reiterate that I should lockmy door. This was the first night I had slept in that house, previously havingbeen in a cottage on the opposite side of the road.I did not lock my door because the night was intolerably hot and the room andthe window small. I compromised, however, by putting an enamel slop-pail at astrategic spot in the fairway, trusting that any intruder would fall over it andgive the alarm.Nothing happened, and I slept quietly.Next morning, however, the storm broke. Miss L. and I were peacefully at work inthe kitchen when she suddenly caught up a carving-knife and started after me, asmad as a March hare. Fortunately for me I had in my hands a large saucepan fullof freshly boiled greens, and I used this as a weapon of defence, and we dancedround the kitchen table, slopping hot cabbage-water in all directions.We neither of us made a sound; I fended her off with the hot and sooty saucepan,and she slashed at me with an unpleasantly large carving-knife. At apsychological moment in walked the head of the community. He took in thesituation at a glance, and handled it by the tactful method of scolding us bothimpartially for making so much noise and telling us to get on with our work.Miss L. finished whatever she was doing with the carver, I dished up thecabbage, and the incident passed off quietly.After lunch Miss L. experienced the reaction from her excitement and went to herroom completely prostrated with exhaustion. I was somewhat perturbed. Althoughused to mental cases, and therefore not as disturbed by the recent fracas asanyone else might have been, I did not relish the prospect of being thehousemate of a dangerous lunatic who was under no sort of control.The head of the community, however, said there was no cause for alarm, he wouldsoon have the case in hand. He went up to the bathroom, filled a soap dish withwater from the tap, made certain passes over it, and dipping his finger in thewater, proceeded to draw a five-pointed star upon the threshold of Miss L.'sroom.Miss L. made no attempt to leave her room until forty-eight hours later when hefetched her out himself.As he had promised, he soon had her in hand. He had several long talks with her,at which I was not present, and at the end of a few days a very chastened MissL. began to go about her household duties again. There were relapses, and therewere struggles, but in the course of a few weeks she became comparativelynormal, and when I met her again some eighteen months later there had been norelapse.Two curious incidents occurred during the period of her treatment at the handsof this man, an adept if ever there was one. The house in which she had a roomwas a very old one, and the front door exceedingly massive. It was secured atnight by two enormous bolts that extended right across it, a chain that couldhave moored a barge, and a huge lock with a key the size of a trowel. When thedoor was opened in the morning it acted as an alarm clock for the entirevillage. It creaked, it groaned, and it clanged. Yet night after night we camedown in the morning to find this door standing ajar. We all slept with our doorsopen on to the small landing. To go down the ancient, creaking stairs was likewalking on organ stops. The back door was a modern affair, which could have beenopened easily. The windows were modern casements of the most gimcrackdescription. Who opened the heavy front door, and why?We exchanged recriminations several mornings at breakfast as to who had left thedoor open the night before, but no one could ever be convicted of the blame.Finally the matter came to the knowledge of the head of the group.“I will soon put a stop to that,” he said, and each night he resealed Miss L.'sroom with the pentagram. We had no more trouble with the front door coming openafter that.While he was dealing with Miss L. he made a practice of sealing the threshold ofhis own room in the same way, only in this case he drew the pentagram pointoutwards, to prevent Miss L. from coming in; whereas when he sealed her room, heput its point inwards, to prevent her coming out. She did not know this, nor wasit likely to reach her ears indirectly, for he was very uncommunicative, I onlyknew that he was sealing his room because I chanced to see him doing it.Nevertheless, one day I heard a knock at my door, and there was Miss L. with herarms full of clean linen. She asked me if I would be good enough to take it intothe room of the head of the community, and put it away. I asked her why she didnot do so herself, for I knew he was out, and it was her work to put away thelinen. She replied that she had been to his room for that purpose, but there wasa psychic barrier across the threshold that prevented her entering.She also asked me, on several occasions, to put inside my frock out of sight alittle silver cross that I habitually wore, as she said she could not bear thesight of it. This cross I had purchased just before coming to this occultcollege, and had taken it to a priest of my acquaintance to be blessed, for Ihad not been altogether easy in my mind concerning the nature of the group I wasjoining, and during the early days of my association with it was poised ontiptoe, as it were, ready for instant flight. Naturally I had kept my owncounsel concerning the psychic precautions I had taken against my new friends,and no one was aware that the cross had been specially magnetised againstpsychic attack. Nevertheless, the woman who would have attacked if she could,felt its influence and feared it.Auto-suggestion and imagination play so large a part in so-called psychicimpressions that one is chary of accepting confirmatory testimony from a psychicwho knows what is expected of him, but a spontaneous reaction is in my opinionevidential. When the treatment of Miss L. had progressed some way towards herfinal recovery, much interesting information was elicited. She told us that shehad distinct memories of dealings with black magic in her previous lives. This,she said, had been confirmed by several independent psychics, and I wouldcertainly have been willing to add my testimony to theirs had I been asked. As achild, she used to daydream that she was a witch, willing the death ormisfortune of those who annoyed her, and she also averred, though whether thiswas true or not I cannot say, that her wishes were so effectual that she wasfrightened and tried to abandon the practice. She also volunteered that she wasin the habit of visualising herself standing before people she was angry with,scolding them, and projecting malignant force at them. This, of course, wouldexplain our nightmares. She also said that she had been in the habit ofattacking her mother and sister in this way, and had made her sister very ill,so that they now refused to have her in the house. This statement was laterconfirmed by the mother.She told us that she felt as if she were two distinct persons, her normal selfbeing spiritually-minded, intensely compassionate and idealistic. Her other, andlower self, which came to the surface when she was crossed, upset, orover-tired, being intensely malicious and subject to paroxysms of hate andcruelty.These characteristics had been particularly marked when she was little. But asshe grew older she recognised the wrongfulness of them, and her lofty idealismrepresented her endeavour to rise above them. This endeavour was, I amconvinced, an honest one; unfortunately it was not always successful.She referred to the incident in which she told me to lock my door, and said shehad done so in the hope of affording me some measure of protection against theastral projection in which she knew she was tempted to indulge.At first sight her case had looked like one of obsession, and had been sodiagnosed by one or two members of the community, but wise handling revealedotherwise.This case reveals another interesting point in that, true to thewitch-tradition, she had a horror of sacred symbols. She would not occupy a roomwhere there was a picture of a religious subject. Nothing would induce her towear any piece of jewellery in the form of a cross, and it was impossible forher to enter a church.This case has many points of interest, especially in the fact that what wasapparently a case of well-marked insanity was cleared up by occult methods."},{"pageContent":"> 4 PROJECTION OF THE ETHERIC BODY > Etheric projection Image [images/00004.jpg] Experience with the projected> etheric body of an adept Image [images/00004.jpg] Repercussion Image> [images/00004.jpg] Artificial elementáis Image [images/00004.jpg] Experience> of accidental projection of a were-wol Image [images/00004.jpg] Method of its> destruction. BEFORE WE CAN leave the subject of attack by incarnate human beings, we mustconsider the subject of etheric projection. In this case not only is the mind atwork, but also something which is pretty nearly physical; sufficiently physical,at any rate, to leave bruises on the flesh of the victim, throw the furnitureabout, or at least make a considerable amount of noise.Where such manifestations take place, it is obvious that we are dealing withsomething more substantial than the mind, for although mind can influence mind,and through it the body to an extent to which in the present state of ourknowledge it is difficult to set limits, mind cannot manipulate matter directly:that is to say, you cannot smash a window by means of a thought. There must besome physical vehicle that can be manipulated by the mind if effects are to bewrought on the physical plane. The living body is such an instrument; it ismanipulated by the mind every time a voluntary movement takes place, and theoperations of spiritual healing are simply an extension of this principle to theinvoluntary muscles and physiological processes not ordinarily directed by theconscious mind. Occultists maintain that mind affects body by means of theetheric double, as it is called, the “mortal mind” of the Christian Scientists.We may not unreasonably conclude that when physical action is produced at adistance by occult means, it is done by employing this etheric double.The etheric double is primarily a body of magnetic stresses in the framework ofwhose meshes every cell and fibre of the physical body is held as in a rack. Butintermediate between this and the dense physical body as we know it, there iswhat may be called the raw material out of which dense matter is condensed. Thiswas called by the ancients, Hyle, or First Matter, and by the moderns,Ectoplasm. It is this projected ectoplasm which produces the phenomena wheneverphysical manifestations are in question. It may be projected as long rods, whichwill operate up to a distance of a dozen feet or so; or it may be projected as anebulous cloud, connected with the medium by a tenuous thread. This cloud can beorganised into distinct forms, having the semblance of life and acting asvehicles for conscious wills. There is a great deal of information available onthis subject in the literature of spiritualism, to which reference may be foundin the bibliography at the end of this book.The adept who was head of the occult college to which I have previouslyreferred, and from whom I received my first training in occultism, was able toperform this operation, and I have many times seen him do it. He would go into adeep trance, after a few convulsive movements, somewhat like a slow tetany, andwould then lose about two-thirds of his weight. I have many times helped to lifthim, of even lifted him single-handed, when he was in this state, and he weighedno more than a child. A man can fake many things, but he cannot fake his weight.I have lifted him single-handed from the floor on to a sofa when in this state.It is quite true that, being rigid as a board, he was much easier to handle thanthe ordinary limp, unconscious human form; but there is a certain ratio betweenthe weight of a grown man and the strength of a woman of average physique.What became of the missing weight on these occasions I found out one night. Hehad been ill, with some delirium, and the lion's share of the nursing,especially the night work, had fallen to my lot. There came a time, however,when we decided that he was so far recovered that it was unnecessary for anyoneto sit up with him, so to bed we all went, for the first time for several days.I shared a room with another member of the community. It was a comparativelysmall cottage we were in, and our two beds were close together, side by side,right under the uncurtained open window. It was the time of the full moon, and Iremember that I had no need to light a candle in order to see to undress.I fell asleep at once, for I was very tired. I could not have been asleep verylong, however, when I was awakened by the sensation of a weight upon my feet. Itwas as if a good-sized dog, say, a collie, had jumped up and lain down on thebed. The room was flooded with moonlight, and as bright as day, and I clearlysaw, lying apparently asleep across the foot of my bed, the man whom we had leftsafely tucked up for the night in the room below. It was a somewhat embarrassingsituation, and I lay still, taking thought before I did anything. I was wideenough awake by now, as may well be imagined. I concluded that Z., as I willcall this man, had either had a return of the delirium, or was sleep-walking. Inany case I was very anxious to get him safely back to bed again without a fussor a scene. My companion had a bad heart, and I did not want her to get a shock;neither did I want him to get a shock in his weak state. I was afraid that if Iasked my room-mate first, she might scream, and wake Z. up with a start, withdisastrous consequences. I decided therefore to wake him gently, as being theworse case of the two, and let her take her chance. Having cogitated thesematters for several moments at least, I finally took action. I sat up in bed andleant quietly forward with the intention of touching him gently on the shoulderand so arousing him. In order to lean forward, I had to withdraw my feet fromunder him, for they were pinned by his weight, which until now had rested uponthem, for I had been careful not to stir while thinking out my plan of campaign.Z. was plainly visible in the moonlight, clad apparently in his dressing-gown,or so I took the muffling folds of material to be that swathed him about. Bothhis face and wrapping appeared grey and colourless in the moonlight, but therewas no question in my mind as to his solidarity, for not only could I see him,but I could feel his weight resting upon my feet. But the moment I moved, hevanished, and I was left staring in amazement at the smooth fold of the blanketsover the end of the little camp-bed on which I lay. It was then, and only then,that I realised he had appeared all grey and colourless, more like a shadedpencil sketch than a human being of flesh and blood.I asked him about this incident in the morning, but he said he had norecollection of it; he had been dreaming the uneasy, broken dreams of a sickman, but could not recall them.This, of course, was in no way an occult attack, but rather the visit of afriend, who had come to lean upon me in the course of his illness, andinstinctively came to me for consolation when out of his body in trance at atime when his weakened condition prevented him from retaining his normal controlover his psychic activities. Nevertheless, it serves to illustrate what could bedone if the etheric form that visited me had been energised by a malignant will.It may explain the nature of the sense of weight that oppresses the victims of acertain type of nightmare.I have heard of more than one case wherein bruises resembling finger-marks werefound on the throats of people who had been victims of an astral attack. I havenever actually seen such bruises myself, but I have been told of them by peoplewho have either had them themselves, or seen them. It is a well-known fact thatif an occultist, functioning out of the body, meets with unpleasantness on theastral plane, or if his subtle body is seen, and struck or shot at, the physicalbody will show the marks. I myself have many times found curiously patternedbruises on my body after an astral skirmish. The mechanism of the production ofsuch marks must, I think, be of the same nature as that which produces thestigmata of saints and the curious physical marks and swellings sometimes seenin hysterics-the mind, powerfully stirred, affects the etheric double, and theetheric double acts upon the physical molecules held in its meshes. I dare toprophesy the next advances in medicine will be bound up with the knowledge ofthe nature and function of the etheric double.The next type of psychic attack which we must consider is that conducted bymeans of artificial elementáis. These are, distinguished from thought-forms bythe fact that, once formulated by the creative mind of the magician, theypossess a distinct and independent life of their own, though strictlyconditioned as to nature by the concept of their creator. The life of thesecreatures is akin to that of an electric battery, it slowly leaks out by meansof radiation, and unless recharged periodically, will finally weaken and dieout. The whole question of the making, charging, recharging, or destruction ofthese artificial elementáis is an important one in practical occultism.The artificial elemental is constructed by forming a clear-cut image in theimagination of the creature it is intended to create, ensouling it withsomething of the corresponding aspect of one's own being, and then invoking intoit the appropriate natural force. This method can be used for good as well asevil, and “guardian angels” are formed in this way. It is said that dying women,anxious concerning the welfare of their children, frequently form themunconsciously.I myself once had an exceedingly nasty experience in which I formulated awere-wolf accidentally. Unpleasant as the incident was, I think it may be justas well to give it publicity, for it shows what may happen when aninsufficiently disciplined and purified nature is handling occult forces.I had received serious injury from someone who, at considerable cost to myself,I had disinterestedly helped, and I was sorely tempted to retaliate. Lying on mybed resting one afternoon, I was brooding over my resentment, and while sobrooding, drifted towards the borders of sleep. There came to my mind thethought of casting off all restraint and going berserk. The ancient Nordic mythsrose before me, and I thought of Fenris, the Wolf-horror of the North.Immediately I felt a curious drawing-out sensation from my solar plexus, andthere materialised beside me on the bed a large wolf. It was a well-materialisedectoplasmic form. Like Z., it was grey and colourless, and like him, it hadweight. I could distinctly feel its back pressing against me as it lay beside meon the bed as a large dog might.I knew nothing about the art of making elementáis at that time, but hadaccidentally stumbled upon the right method -the brooding highly charged withemotion, the invocation of the appropriate natural force, and the conditionbetween sleeping and waking in which the etheric double readily extrudes.I was horrified at what I had done, and knew I was in a tight corner and thateverything depended upon my keeping my head. I had had enough experience ofpractical occultism to know that the thing I had called into visiblemanifestation could be controlled by my will provided I did not panic; but thatif I lost my nerve and it got the upper hand, I had a Frankenstein monster tocope with.I stirred slightly, and the creature evidently objected to being disturbed, forit turned its long snout towards me over its shoulder, and snarled, showing itsteeth. I had now “got the wind” up properly; but I knew that everything dependedon my getting the upper hand and keeping it, and that the best thing I could dowas to fight it out now, because the longer the Thing remained in existence, thestronger it would get, and the more difficult to disintegrate. So I drove myelbow into its hairy ectoplasmic ribs and said to it out loud:“If you can't behave yourself, you will have to go on the floor,” and pushed itoff the bed.Down it went, meek as a lamb, and changed from wolf to dog, to my great relief.Then the northern corner of the room appeared to fade away, and the creaturewent out through the gap.I was far from happy, however, for I had a feeling that this was not the end ofit, and my feeling was confirmed when next morning another member of myhousehold reported that her sleep had been disturbed by dreams of wolves, andshe had awakened in the night to see the eye of a wild animal shining in thedarkness in the corner of her room.Now, thoroughly alarmed, I went off to seek advice from one whom I have alwayslooked upon as my teacher, and I was told that I had made this Thing out of myown substance by revengeful thoughts, and that it was really a part of myselfextruded, and that I must at all costs recall it and reabsorb it into myself, atthe same time forgoing my desire to “settle accounts” with the person who hadinjured me. Curiously enough, just at this time there came an opportunity mosteffectually to “settle” with my antagonist.Fortunately for all concerned, I had enough sense left to see that I was at thedividing of the ways, and if I were not careful would take the first step on tothe Left-hand Path. If I availed myself of the opportunity to give practicalexpression to my resentment, the wolf-form would be born into an independentexistence, and there would be the devil to pay, literally as well asmetaphorically. I received the distinct impression, and impressions areimportant things in psychic matters, for they often represent subconsciousknowledge and experience, that once the wolf-impulse had found expression inaction, the wolf-form would sever the psychic navel-cord that connected it withmy solar plexus, and it would be no longer possible for me to absorb it.The prospect was not a pleasant one. I had to forgo my dearly-loved revenge andallow harm to be done to me without defending myself, and I also had to summonand absorb a wolf-form which, to my psychic consciousness at any rate, lookedunpleasantly tangible. Nor was it a situation in which I could either ask forassistance or expect much sympathy. However, it had to be faced, and I knew thatwith every hour of the Thing's existence it would be harder to deal with, so Imade the resolution to let the opportunity for revenge slip through my fingers,and at first dusk summoned the Creature. It came in through the northern cornerof the room again (subsequently I learnt that the north was considered among theancients as the evil quarter), and presented itself upon the hearthrug in quitea mild and domesticated mood. I obtained an excellent materialisation in thehalf-light, and could have sworn that a big Alsatian was standing there lookingat me. It was tangible, even to the dog-like odour.From it to me stretched a shadowy line of ectoplasm, one end was attached to mysolar plexus, and the other disappeared in the shaggy fur of its belly, but Icould not see the actual point of attachment. I began by an effort of the willand imagination to draw the life out of it along this silver cord, as if suckinglemonade up a straw. The wolf-form began to fade, the cord thickened and grewmore substantial. A violent emotional upheaval started in myself; I felt themost furious impulses to go berserk and rend and tear anything and anybody thatcame to hand, like the Malay running amok. I conquered this impulse with aneffort, and the upheaval subsided. The wolf-form had now faded into a shapelessgrey mist. This too absorbed along the silver cord. The tension relaxed and Ifound myself bathed in perspiration. That, as far as I know, was the end of theincident.I had had a sharp lesson, and a highly instructive one. It may not be convincingto other people, owing to the lack of corroborative evidence, but it wasexceedingly evidential to me, and I put it on record for what it is worth tothose who, having personal knowledge of these things, can see its significance.It is a curious point that, during the brief twenty-four hours of the Thing'slife, the opportunity for an effectual vengeance presented itself."},{"pageContent":"> 5 VAMPIRISM > Vampirism supposed to have died out Image [images/00004.jpg] Curious effect of> certain persons upon their associates Image [images/00004.jpg] Effect of the> same persons upon electric batteries Image [images/00004.jpg] Morbid rapports> Image [images/00004.jpg] Oedipus complex Image [images/00004.jpg] Psychic> parasitism Image [images/00004.jpg] The Berberlangs Image [images/00004.jpg]> Description of case of vampirism Image [images/00004.jpg] Necrophilia on the> Western Front Image [images/00004.jpg] Vampirism in South-Eastern Europe Image> [images/00004.jpg] Contagiousness of vampirism Image [images/00004.jpg]> Abnormal “mosquito-bites.” Image [images/00004.jpg] Where to look for vampire> marks Image [images/00004.jpg] The characteristic teeth of vampires. THE ALLEGED VAMPIRE has always been a popular character in tales of mystery andimagination. There is a considerable literature concerning his doings, from thefamous novel Dracula to serious studies of the mediaeval witch-trials, for whichthe reader is referred to the bibliography at the end of the book. In thesepages, however, I do not want to avail myself of second-hand evidence, nor ofincidents which took place in other centuries and under primitive conditions,for it might be argued that with the passing of such conditions from our midst,the problem of vampirism, like the problem of typhus, has gone too, and need nottrouble us. From my own experience I am of the opinion, however, that this isnot so, and that the peculiar condition which the ancients called vampirism mayaccount for certain forms of mental disturbance and the physical ill-healthassociated therewith.When psychoanalysis was first introduced into England I took up the subject, andbecame a student, and eventually a lecturer at a clinic that was founded inLondon. We students were soon struck by the fact that some cases wereexceedingly exhausting to deal with. It was not that they were troublesome, butsimply that they “took it out” of us, and left us feeling like limp rags at theend of a treatment. Someone happened to mention this fact to one of the nursesengaged in the electrical department, and she told us that the same patientsequally “took it out of the electrical machines and that they could absorb themost surprising voltages without turning a hair.At the same place, in the course of my psychoanalytical work, I came across anumber of cases where a morbid attachment existed between two people, mostcommonly mother and daughter, or two women friends; sometimes also betweenmother and son, and in one case I met socially, between a man and a woman. Itwas always the negative one of the pair who came for treatment, and we were ableto benefit them considerably by psycho-therapeutic means.They always showed the same symptom-complex, a sensitive temperament, pallidcomplexion, wasted form and general debility, sense of weakness, and were easilyfatigued. They were also invariably highly suggestible, and were therefore easyto handle. Consequently we were usually able to get good results pretty quicklyin such cases.The curious point, however, was that the breaking of the morbid rapport caused amarked disturbance and even semi-collapse of the dominant partner in thealliance. We found it necessary to insist upon a separation if a cure were to beeffected, and the separation invariably disagreed very actively with thedominant partner.At that time I explained everything in terms of the psychology, but even so, Icould not help being struck by the curious effect a separation had upon theperson who was not supposed to be ill, and that as the one went uphill, theother went down.I am of the opinion that what Freud calls an Oedipus complex is not altogether aone-sided affair, and that the “soul” of the parent is drawing upon the psychicvitality of the child. It is curious how aged Oedipus cases always look, andwhat little old men and women they are as children. They never have a normalchildhood, but always are mentally mature for their years. I persuaded variouspatients to show me photographs of themselves as children, and was much struckby the elderly, worried expression of the childish faces, as if they had knownall of life's problem and burdens.Knowing what we do of telepathy and the magnetic aura, it appears to me notunreasonable to suppose that in some way which we do not as yet fullyunderstand, the negative partner of such a rapport is “shorting” on to thepositive partner. There is a leakage of vitality going on, and the dominantpartner is more or less consciously lapping it up, if not actually sucking itout.Such cases are by no means uncommon, and clear up rapidly when the victim isseparated from the vampire. Whenever there is a record of a close and dominatingbond between two people with the devitalisation of one of them, it is a goodplan to recommend a temporary separation and observe the results.Such cases as these, however, may more justly be described as parasitism thanvampirism. Such psychic parasitism is exceedingly common, and explains manypsychological problems. We will not pursue the subject in these pages, however,as it is outside the scope of our present enquiry, and is merely mentioned forillustrative purposes. Vampirism, as generally understood, is a very differentmatter, and we shall do well to reserve the term for those cases wherein theattack is deliberate, applying the term parasitism to the cases wherein it isunconscious and involuntary.In my opinion, true vampirism cannot take place unless there is power to projectthe etheric double. All the records of vampirism that we have give an account ofsomething much more tangible than a haunting. In Western Europe the occurrenceseems to be comparatively rare in modern times, but in Eastern Europe and inprimitive countries it appears to be by no means uncommon, and innumerablewell-authenticated cases occur in books of travel.Commander Gould, in his exceedingly interesting book, Oddities, gives an accountof vampirism among the Berberlangs of the Philippine Islands. His account isbased on a paper printed in the Journal of the Asiatic Society, Vol. LXV, 1896.These unpleasant people, according to Mr. Skertchley, the author of the articlewhich Commander Gould quotes, “are ghouls, and must eat human flesh occasionallyor they would die.... When they feel a craving for a meal of human flesh they goaway into the grass, and having carefully hidden their bodies, hold theirbreaths and fall into a trance. Their astral bodies are then liberated. . . .They fly away, and entering a house, make their way into the body of one of theoccupants and feed on his entrails.“The Berberlangs may be heard coming, as they make a moaning noise, which isloud at a distance and dies away to a feeble moan as they approach. When theyare near you, the sound of their wings may be heard, and the flashing lights oftheir eyes can be seen dancing like fire-flies in the dark.”Mr. Skertchley declares that he himself saw and heard a flight of Berberlangspass by, and, visiting next day the house he saw them enter, found the occupantdead without any sign of external violence.Compare Mr. Skertchley's account of the Berberlangs lying in the long grass andthrowing themselves into trance with Mr. Muldoon's account of The Projection ofthe Astral Body, with which every student of occultism ought to be familiar, forit is undoubtedly a classic of occult literature, being a practical account ofoccult experiences and detailed instructions how to go and do likewise.But to return nearer home. In the course of my experience of the byways of thehuman mind, which, from the nature of my work, has been, like Sam Weller'sknowledge of London, extensive and peculiar, I have only known one case ofgenuine vampirism, according to the sense in which I use the term, and this wasnot one of my own cases, though I knew the persons concerned, but was handled bymy original teacher, whom I have already referred to in connection with the caseof the good lady who chased me with a carving-knife. I have made use of thefacts of this case as a groundwork for one of the stories in The Secrets of Dr.Taverner, but the actual facts are such that they were unsuitable for a worksupposedly designed to amuse.At that time I was doing the tutorials in abnormal psychology at the clinic Ihave spoken of, and, supervising the work of the other students, one of themtook counsel with me concerning a case that had come to her in private practice,the case of a youth in the late ‘teens, one of those degenerate but intellectualand socially presentable types that not infrequently crop up in old familieswhose blood is too blue to be wholesome.This lad was taken as boarder in a flat which the student shared with anotherwoman, and they soon began to be troubled with curious phenomena. About the sametime every evening the dogs in a neighbouring mews began a furious outcry ofbarking and howling, and a few moments later the French window leading on to theverandah would open. It did not matter how often they got the locksmith to it,nor how they barricaded it, open it would come at the appointed time, and a colddraught sweep through the flat.This phenomenon took place one evening when the adept, Z., was present, and hedeclared that an unpleasant invisible entity had entered. They lowered thelights, and were able to see a dull glow in the corner he indicated, and whenthey put their hands into this glow, felt a tingling sensation such as isexperienced when the hands are put into electrically-charged water.Then began a mighty spook-hunt up and down the flat, and the presence wasfinally cornered and dispatched in the bathroom. I have staged the incidentsomewhat more picturesquely in my story, but the essential facts are the same.The result of the dispatching of this entity was a marked improvement in thecondition of the boy patient, and the elicitation of the following story.The boy, whom we will call D., was in the habit of going to sit with a cousinwho had been invalided home from France suffering from alleged shell-shock. Thisyoung man was another scion of a worn-out stock, and it transpired that he hadbeen caught red-handed in that unpleasant perversion called necrophilia.According to the story elicited from the parents of D., this vice was notuncommon on certain sections of the Front, as were also attacks on wounded men.The authorities were taking drastic steps to put it down. Owing to familyinfluence the cousin of D. was able to escape incarceration in a militaryprison, and was placed in the care of his family as a mental case, and they puthim in the charge of a male nurse. It was while the male nurse was off duty thatthe unfortunate young D. was misguidedly employed to sit with him. It also cameout that the relations between D. and his cousin were of a vicious nature, andon one occasion he bit the boy on the neck, just under the ear, actually drawingblood.D. had always been under the impression that some “ghost” attacked him duringhis crises, but had not dared to say so for fear of being thought mad.What may have been the exact percentage of neurotic taint, vice, and psychicattack, it is difficult to say, nor is it easy to decide which was thepredisposing cause that opened the door to all the trouble, but one thing stoodout clearly to all beholders, that with the dispatch of the psychic visitant,not only did D.'s condition clear up immediately, but after a short, sharpupheaval the cousin also recovered. The method of dispatch used by the adept,Z., was to pin the entity inside a magic circle, so that it could not get away,and then absorb it into himself through compassion. As he completed theoperation, he fell over backwards unconscious. It was, in fact, the same methodthat I was instructed to use in dealing with my were-wolf, but it is a much moreformidable task to absorb and transmute the projection of another person than toabsorb one's own, and could only have been accomplished by an initiate of a veryhigh grade, which Z. indubitably was.His opinion concerning the case, though there was no means of obtainingindependent confirmation of this, was that some Eastern European troops had beenbrought to the Western Front, and among these were individuals with thetraditional knowledge of Black Magic for which South-Eastern Europe has alwaysenjoyed a sinister reputation among occultists. These men, getting killed, knewhow to avoid going to the Second Death, that is to say, the disintegration ofthe Astral Body, and maintained themselves in the etheric double by vampirisingthe wounded. Now vampirism is contagious; the person who is vampirised, beingdepleted of vitality, is a psychic vacuum, himself absorbing from anyone hecomes across in order to refill his depleted resources of vitality. He soonlearns by experience the tricks of a vampire without realising theirsignificance, and before he knows where he is, he is a full blown vampirehimself, vampirising others. The earth-bound soul of a vampire sometimesattaches itself permanently to one individual if it succeeds in making afunctioning vampire of him, systematically drawing its etheric nutriment fromhim, for, since he in his turn is resupplying himself from others, he will notdie from exhaustion as victims of vampires do in the ordinary way.Z. was of the opinion that D.'s cousin was not the primary vampire in the case,but was himself a victim. Being a youth of unstable morale, he speedily acquiredthe vampire tricks, and the earth-bound soul of some Magyar magician exploitedhim. Through his act of biting and drawing blood from the neck of his cousin,this entity became transferred to young D., preferring pastures new to thedepleted resources of its previous victim. Probably it alternated between thetwo, for it was not constantly with D.Exactly what Z. did we do not know, for he was exceedingly secretive concerninghis methods, but in the light of subsequent knowledge I should imagine that heabsorbed the etheric energy of the earth-bound soul, and thus deprived it of itsmeans of resisting the Second Death. Merely to drive the resisting soul out tothe Judgment Hall of Osiris would have involved leaving behind an astral corpse,which for some time would have continued to give trouble.It may be interesting to note in connection with this case that during the timethat Miss L. was at the occult college in Hampshire we had some rather curioushappenings. There was an outbreak among us of exceedingly bad “mosquito bites.”The bites themselves were not poisonous, but the stabs were of such a naturethat they bled freely. I remember waking up one morning to find a patch of bloodthe size of the palm of my hand on the pillow; it had apparently come from asmall puncture just behind the angle of the jaw. Several others had similarexperiences. I have never seen anything like it, either before or since, nor didit occur again after Miss L. left.I did not tell the adept Z. about it at the time, and later, when I was remindedof the incident and mentioned it, the opportunity for investigation had gone by.He expressed the opinion that it was a vampire's work, and cited similar caseswhich he had met with in the course of his experience. He said he had seen casesin Africa where the victim had become so bloodless that it was with difficultythat a specimen of blood could be obtained for examination, for it could hardlybe induced to flow from the debilitated tissue.Nothing can be done for such cases by medical science. They are dying by inchesand yet no organic disease can be demonstrated. Nevertheless, their appearanceis that of a person sinking from repeated haemorrhages.When vampirism is suspected the thing to do is to go over that person's bodyinch by inch with a powerful magnifying-glass, and the search will probably berewarded by the discovery of numerous minute punctures, so minute that they arenot discovered by the naked eye unless they reveal themselves by becominginfected and suppurating, when they are usually mistaken for insect bites. Theyare bites right enough, but not those of an insect. The places to look for themare around the neck; down the inner surface of the forearms; on the lobes of theears; about the tips of the toes and in a woman, upon the breasts.It is said that a person with vampire tendencies develops abnormally long andsharp canine teeth, and I have myself seen one such case, and a curious sight itwas. The two canine teeth, the pair that come between the incisors and thedouble teeth, were half as long again as the others, and terminated in points ofneedle-like sharpness.True Vampirism in Western Europe appears to be rare, but Z. was of the opinionthat many obscure cases of tropical debility in which anaemia played a prominentpart might be attributed to this cause."},{"pageContent":"> 6 HAUNTINGS > Interference by earth-bound souls Image [images/00004.jpg] Case of dead> drunkard who over-shadowed his wife Image [images/00004.jpg] Case of dead> lover who caused astral projection in his fiancee Image [images/00004.jpg]> Thought-atmospheres Image [images/00004.jpg] Example of stage fright Image> [images/00004.jpg] Case of haunting by the atmosphere left behind by a living> drunkard Image [images/00004.jpg] How to distinguish between atmospheres and> entities Image [images/00004.jpg] Haunting by a suicidal lunatic Image> [images/00004.jpg] Phenomena connected with case of haunting by a Black> Occultist Image [images/00004.jpg] Vampirism Image [images/00004.jpg]> Poltergeist phenomena Image [images/00004.jpg] Outbreaks of fire Image> [images/00004.jpg] Method of handling Image [images/00004.jpg] Subsequent> elucidation Image [images/00004.jpg] Forces evoked by ritual magic Image> [images/00004.jpg] Their effect on casual visitors Image [images/00004.jpg]> Forces evoked by Christian rituals Image [images/00004.jpg] Hauntings of> vicarages Image [images/00004.jpg] Objects magnetized by ceremonial Image> [images/00004.jpg] Incident of the consecrated crosses Image> [images/00004.jpg] Spurious curios Image [images/00004.jpg] Incident of the> altar in the cast-room at the British Museum Image [images/00004.jpg] Types of> atmosphere in the different rooms at the British Museum Image> [images/00004.jpg] The mummy's curse Image [images/00004.jpg] Reverence for> the sacred objects of another faith Image [images/00004.jpg] Dugpa Buddhas> Image [images/00004.jpg] Incident in connection with a statue of the Buddha> Image [images/00004.jpg] Evil thought forms returning to their sender Image> [images/00004.jpg] Hallucinations of the insane are projected thought-forms. THERE ARE TWO forms of “haunting” which have to be considered, the one which isdue to a discarnate soul who interferes with a particular person, and the onewhich is due to the conditions prevailing in a particular place, and whichaffects any person sufficiently sensitive who happens to go there. Except incases where the influence is exceptionally strong, the insensitive person isimmune. To perceive a “haunting” one needs, as a general rule, to be slightlypsychic; it is for this reason that children, Celts and the coloured racessuffer severely from such interferences, and the stolid Nordic type iscomparatively immune, and, to a lesser extent, the lively, materialistic andsceptical Latin.Let us consider first of all the question of interference by a discarnate soul.It will be noted that I use the term “interference” and not “attack.” Thedisturbance need not necessarily be an attack, any more than the drowning manwho clings to his rescuer and drags him under is motived by malice. The entitythat is causing the trouble may be a soul that is itself in distress on theInner Planes, and is too ignorant of post-mortem conditions to know the harm itis doing by clinging so desperately to the living. It is for this reason thatthe wide dissemination of Spiritualistic teaching is of value, for it helps torelieve the tension between this world and the next.As far as my experience goes, I am inclined to think that deliberate malevolenceis rare; but this panic-stricken clinging is not uncommon, and explains why thesurvivor of a pair sometimes goes through very unpleasant experiences after thedeath of the partner. There are also cases, though rarer, wherein a soul who hassome occult knowledge but is bound strongly to earth by sensual desires, uses acurious form of rapport in order to gratify those desires through the physicalbody of another.There are innumerable instances of both these types of astral interference inoccult and spiritualistic literature, but as I am confining myself to caseswithin my own experience, I will not cite them, but limit myself to listing theliterature of the subject in the bibliography.Someone of my acquaintance lost, after a long illness, her husband to whom shewas much attached, but whom most people would have thought she was well rid of,as for many years he had been addicted to drink, and died finally after a longillness during which he was kept under morphia for prolonged periods, takingenormous quantities. He was a man of intensely malignant and selfishdisposition, and died unrepentant. She, however, during the course of his lastillness, when, being bedridden, he could do no more harm, elected to idolisehim, and as soon as he was safely dead, canonised him into the family saint. Shewas interested in occultism and in the habit of practising meditation andinvoking the Masters. In spite of all counsel to the contrary, she began to tryand get into psychic touch with her husband, invoking him as her guide. Likemany other men of a sensual disposition, he had clung desperately to life,remaining in articulo mortis for days. Fortunately for all concerned, it hadbeen possible to persuade her to have his remains cremated, but despite allpersuasion she brought all his belongings from the nursing-home where he haddied and kept them in her bedroom, and made a little altar around his photographand used it as the focus of her meditations.The last illness had been a long and trying one, and she had been living at theend of a telephone wire, in a state of constant anxiety for weeks, but had hadno physical strain, so there was nothing physical to account for the seriousillness which ensued after the strain was over. It soon became noticeable thatshe, who had previously had a very lovable and gentle disposition, was graduallychanging, so that not only in temperament, but in facial expression, she wasgrowing like her late husband. Next a curious thing ensued. Her husband had diedof an inflammatory spinal lesion which caused no pain at the site of thetrouble, but intense pain in the nerves that issued from the spine at thatpoint, so that the pain was referred to a particular distribution in the handsand arms, more upon one side than the other. The lady developed a severeneuritis that exactly corresponded in its distribution to her late husband'ssymptoms.Another illustrative case is that of Miss E., whose fiance was killed during theWar. She says in a letter written to the person whom she consulted with regardto her problem;“I was able to rise above the loss and separation at the time, but six monthslater I suffered nervous breakdown; from this time I have been troubled withweak nerves. For the last two months I have been having very extraordinaryexperiences which are causing me much perplexity and rendering me unfit forwork. It is a night experience and has not once occurred during the day. After Ihave composed myself for sleep I find that gradually my body is losing allsensation; it feels as if I was being slowly frozen stiff. (I don't know howelse to describe it.) At this stage I can sometimes rouse myself and overcomeit, but I cannot always do this. My efforts to rouse myself are in vain, andalthough fully conscious I feel unable to move or call. Usually after this Isink into some kind of sleep. I have all kinds of experiences. Sometimes I visitstrange places and talk with people I don't know. Sometimes my experiences arebeautiful beyond description; sometimes I am threatened with danger of drowningor falling, but in these cases I always rise in the air and travel for miles, itseems to me. Sometimes I feel that I am just floating in the air. How long thedream lasts I cannot tell. When I wake up, however, I have great difficulty inmoving for some time; but gradually I retain the power to move about, and aftera lot of stinging sensation in the limbs I get up, usually feeling very tiredand unrefreshed, but sometimes I feel none the worse for the strange experience.But it is undermining my health and happiness, and it cannot be good.”In conversation she amplified the statements in her letter, and said that duringthe experiences described, someone, she thought it was her fiance, was trying toprevent her from getting back into her body again after these nocturnalexpeditions.The case was entirely cleared up in one week by means of telepathic treatment.The notes on the manner in which the work was done are of considerable interest.“The treatment was given to the entity that was causing the trouble, not merelyto the patient, and it was the release of the obsessor from his plane of workand helping him Heavenward that gave freedom to his victim.”In the other type of haunting, that in which it is the place which is the focusof manifestation, not a special person, we must distinguish between theearth-bound entity which remains attached to a particular spot, and thethought-atmosphere which is left behind after violent emotions have beenexperienced there.Let us consider first the question of thought-atmosphere, of which I can give avery illuminating example. A friend of mine who was a student at a school ofdramatic art consulted me concerning an attack of stage fright she had had,which left her rather nervous as to its recurrence. She was an experiencedstudent, in fact a pupil teacher, and she was having some extra tuition from thehead of the school. Going for her lesson one afternoon, she found that herteacher had just finished taking the junior students for their end-of-termexamination in elocution. She went on to the stage and stood beside the smalltable which had been placed there for the convenience of the examiner, andcommenced to recite the piece on which she was to have het lesson. She herselfhad no occasion for nervousness; as had already been noted, she was anexperienced speaker and teacher; moreover, nothing of importance hung upon thislesson, it was merely one of a series. Nor was she usually nervous orself-conscious. But as soon as she tried to start, she experienced a complete“dry-up,” and stood paralysed, unable to utter a word. A little prompting soonstarted her off, however, but she had experienced a nasty attack of stagefright, and it shook her nerve.From the psychic point of view, the explanation was not far to seek. She wasstanding in the mental atmosphere created by a series of girls who had gone onto that platform for an examination upon which a good deal depended for them,and who had all been correspondingly nervous. She herself, being sensitive, hadbeen affected by this atmosphere, which induced in her a similar mental state bymeans of what is called “sympathetic induction,” a phenomenon well known inelectricity and in acoustics, but equally valid in psychology.No doubt the unfortunate examinees themselves were infecting each other. It maywell be that the “microphone panic,” so well known to broadcasters, is caused bythe thought-atmosphere generated by a succession of nervous people who havestood upon the same spot.An experience of my own may be of interest in this connection. I took abed-sitting-room in a hostel, and as soon as I came there, I found myselfafflicted with the most intense depression. I am not usually subject to theblues, being normally a cheerful soul, but as soon as I entered this room, whichwas a sunny and pleasant, the cloud descended upon me, but lifted again as soonas I went out of it, whether into the dining room of the hostel, or out ofdoors. I soon recognised that here was something that needed to be dealt with,and enquired as to the history of the room. I was told that it had previouslybeen the bedroom of the last owner of the house, who had been addicted to drinkand had gone bankrupt. It is a curious fact that drunkards and drug addicts makevery evil psychic atmospheres, whereas a person who is a common criminal,however bad, is not nearly so noxious and his atmosphere fades rapidly.In these two cases there was no question of an entity, discarnate or incarnate,being concerned in the matter; there was merely an unpleasant mental atmospheregenerated by some powerful and painful emotion that had been experienced over aconsiderable period at that spot.Such a concentration, if very strong, will linger almost indefinitely. Thestructures that saw the concentration may have been pulled down and new onesbuilt, nevertheless the forces remain, like a previous exposure on aphotographic plate, and sensitive people are affected by them. The insensitivemay escape comparatively scathe less.It is not altogether an easy matter to determine whether the disturbance is dueto atmosphere alone, or whether an earth-bound entity complicates the situation.Where an entity is present, it will usually be seen sooner or later. Moreover,it will usually be heard as well as felt. This latter sign, however, does notinvariably indicate the presence of an organised entity, for I know of a casewherein a room that had been used as a lodge of ritual initiation wassubsequently partitioned into an office and two bedrooms after the lodge wasmoved elsewhere, and the bedrooms were practically uninhabitable owing to thedin of cracks, bangs and thumpings that went on at night. In such a case therewas no reason to suspect the presence of any entity, for the rituals had notbeen of an evocative type, nor was the influence evil. It was merely force in astate of tension. It was sheer physical noise that made the disturbance, as Ican testify, for I have slept, or rather, tried to sleep there.Where a ghost is seen, it is usually also heard because for a form to besufficiently substantial to be visible there must be a modicum at least ofectoplasm in its composition, and ectoplasm is capable of exercising force onthe physical plane, in some degree at least. Where a ghost is both seen andheard, we may be sure there is an actual haunting. Where it is seen, but notheard, it may possibly be that a person with psychic tendencies is perceivingthe images in the reflecting ether, the photographic plate of Nature, and theremay be no actual entity present. Where the disturbance is heard, but not seen,it may be due to astral forces set in motion by ritual magic, and which continuefor a while after the original impulse is withdrawn. These may be perfectlyharmless, save that, they disturb the sleep in the same way that a rattlingwindow would do. On the other hand, if powerful evocative rituals have beenperformed, and the clearing of the sphere has not been properly done, profounddisturbances may result and the whole situation be exceedingly unpleasant.Examples will again help to make the problem clear. As an instance of anon-ritual haunting, I may cite the case of a friend of mine who went to live ina block of modern mansions. From the first she was not happy there, and as timewent by the oppression and distress strengthened. Coming into her drawing- roomone evening at dusk, she saw in the half-light a man standing with his back tothe room, gazing intently out of the window. She switched on the light, andfound that there was no one there. On several occasions her maid saw someonewalk down the passage leading to this room. Moreover, the hall door had a knackof coming open of its own accord.My friend's depression deepened until finally, when standing herself at thedrawing-room window one day, she had a sudden impulse to fling herself out. Thenshe realised that things were serious and that liver-pills and a weekend at theseaside would not put them right. Being an occultist, she understood thesignificance of the happenings that had been going on in her flat, and she madeenquiries concerning the history of the square in which this block of modernmansions had been built. She learnt that it was the site of an old madhouse ofsinister reputation. The form that she and her maid had seen was probably thatof some unfortunate patient of suicidal tendencies who had succeeded in givingeffect to his impulses on a spot corresponding to the situation of her room. Theterrific emotional forces generated by his brooding and last desperate act werephotographed on the atmosphere, as it were, and suggested to her mind thoughtsof self-destruction just as the ill-temper or depression of a companion willinduce a similar mood in ourselves without any word spoken.Another example within the sphere of my experience, although it was not actuallymy case, is of much interest in that it combines an example of a very definitepoltergeist haunting with vampirism.I was once consulted by a mental healer to whom a very curious case had beenbrought. Some charitably disposed people had raised funds to found a home forunwanted babies, and a suitable house had been purchased on the outskirts of avillage not far from London. The house had been a conspicuous bargain and theywere very pleased with it.Soon, however, they began to be disturbed by some curious phenomena, and also byinexplicable illness and seizures among the babies. One child, in fact, actuallydied and its death was not satisfactorily accounted for. Then one of the nurses,an Irish girl, began to be affected also; Celts are notoriously susceptible topsychic influences, and are always the first to be affected by them. It will beobserved that the babies went down first under the attack, their resistancebeing low compared to that of an adult; and then the most sensitive of theadults was affected, the Irish Celt.On several occasions the sound was heard of a cart and horse coming up thedrive, but when the maid went to the door to open it, there was nothing to beseen. Soon the ghost became even more energetic, and took to shovelling the coalfrom side to side of an outhouse. It would shift several tons of coal in thisway in a night, the occupants of the house lying shivering in their beds whilelumps of coal thudded and rumbled against the sides of the bunkers. As to why orwherefore this particular manifestation should take place, I can offer nosuggestion.On several occasions different people saw a strange man crossing the hall, andimmediately afterwards children were taken ill.Finally, in addition to all other troubles, mysterious fires began to break outall over the house. A basket of clean linen in an empty room was found to be onfire. Curtains were found to be smouldering. Meanwhile, the unfortunate Irishnurse went from bad to worse, lying in bed too weak to stand up, and rapidlygoing off her head.It will probably be suggested that some mischievous or demented person was atthe bottom of the trouble, but it is difficult to know what human agency eithercould or would shovel a truck load of coal across a shed single-handed duringthe night.The superintendent of the home was interested in mental healing and knew enoughof the mind side of things to realise that something abnormal was happening inthe house under her charge. She consulted a mental healer, who in her turnconsulted me.I made a psychic diagnosis of the case, and reported that in my opinion thehouse had at some time been occupied by someone who had a knowledge ofoccultism, and who, being upon the Left-hand Path, objected strongly to going toface his portion of Purgatory after the death of the physical body, and that hewas maintaining himself in an intermediate state as an earth-bound spirit bydrawing upon the vitality of the unfortunate children, and had accidentallydrawn too much from one, thus killing it outright.Working on this hypothesis, the healer undertook to give the case “absenttrearment.” Needless to say, the officials of the home were not taken into ourconfidence.The result of this treatment was that the manifestations immediately ceased. Nomore children had seizures and the Irish nurse rapidly recovered. Thesuperintendent was then told the hypothesis upon which we had worked. She wasgreatly interested, and made enquiries in the village as to the history of thehouse, and learned that it was notoriously haunted, which was the reason theyhad obtained it so cheaply. It appeared that no tenant could stop there long,and that there was a constant record of these exhausting and mysteriousillnesses. It also transpired that about sixty years previously the house hadbeen occupied for a long period by a man who was viewed askance by hisneighbours as an eccentric and mysterious personage, and was reported to beengaged in some sort of research which necessitated the use of a laboratory intowhich no one was ever allowed to go, and in which he worked by night.It is interesting to note that neither the mental healer nor myself ever visitedthe house or were within twenty miles of it; for it shows in what way theseunseen forces can be manipulated from a distance.A final example, taken from The Confessions of Aleister Crowley will serve toshow the nature of a haunting produced by ceremonial magic in which the forcesinvoked are not adequately dispersed.“The demons connected with Abramelin do not wait to be invoked, they comeunsought. One night Jones and I went out to dinner. I noticed on leaving theWhite Temple that the latch of its Yale lock had not caught. Accordingly Ipulled the door to and tested it. As we went out, we noticed semi-solid shadowson the stairs; the whole atmosphere was vibrating with the forces we had beenusing. (We were trying to condense them into sensible images.) When we cameback, nothing had been disturbed in the flat; but the Temple door was wide open,the furniture disarranged, and some of the symbols flung about the room. Werestored order, and then observed that semi-materialised beings were marchinground the main room in almost unending procession.“When I finally left the flat for Scotland, it was found that the mirrors weretoo big to take out save by the way of the Black Temple. This had, of course,been completely dismantled before the workmen arrived. But the atmosphereremained, and two of them were put out of action for several hours. It wasalmost a weekly experience, by the way, to hear of casual callers fainting, orbeing seized with dizziness, cramp or apoplexy on the staircase. It was a longtime before these rooms were re-let. People felt instinctively the presence ofsomething uncanny.”It is well known to all psychics that the sites of ancient temples wheremystery-rituals have been worked, are always potently charged with psychicforce. This force need not necessarily be evil, but it has a powerfullystimulating effect upon the psychic centres and stirs up the subconsciousforces; and as the majority, of civilised people suffer in a greater or lesserdegree from what Freud calls “repression,” such a stirring of the subliminalmind produces a feeling of profound disturbance. We should not unquestioninglyattribute evil influence to a place or a person that causes us discomfort; itmay merely be that psychic force at a greater tension than we are accustomed tois disturbing our equilibrium.The sites of monasteries that were disbanded with persecution at the time of theReformation are also frequently badly “haunted” by psychic forces. Thegroup-mind of a religious community is a very potent thing, and when it isdisturbed by the corporate emotion of its members, the forces thus let loose arenot readily dispersed. Moreover, the monks, initiates of the Mysteries of Jesus,would not be likely to hand over their sacred places to the despoilers with anygood will. It has been reported again and again that a curse rests on those whoprofited by the spoliation of Church lands. This is too well known to requirediscussion in these pages.There is another fact in connection with Church property, however, which may notbe so well known, and that is the frequency with which psychic happenings arereported in connection with vicarages. In enquiring among friends andfellow-workers for data in connection with the research that has gone to themaking of this book, I have been astonished how frequently a vicarage has beenmentioned in connection with the phenomena of which I have been told.The rituals of the Church are, of course, ceremonial magic, as is admitted byeven such an orthodox authority as Evelyn Underhill. The average clergyman isnot conversant with the technique of occultism, and has therefore little or nounderstanding of what he is doing. What influences he brings to the altar, andwhat forces he takes away there from, must therefore be an open question in eachindividual case. A man whose consciousness has been exalted by ritual, and whodoes not know how to seal his aura and return to normal is liable to psychicinvasion.Objects associated with any form of ceremonial operations are invariably highlycharged with magnetism and intimately linked with the force whose uses they haveserved. I remember, many years ago, when I had but little knowledge of occultismand no pretensions at all to psychism, that two friends and myself were amusingourselves by turning over each other's trinket-boxes. I picked up a handsomeamethyst cross, from one of them, and immediately exclaimed:“There is something extraordinary about this cross. It feels as if it werealive.”“That was the cross that was given me at my first communion,” replied my friend,and it was originally a bishop's pectoral cross.”Her sister was greatly interested, and immediately brought her own jewel-case tome and asked me if I could pick out her first communion cross also, for, likeher sister, she was a Roman Catholic, and these crosses that were given them aspresents on the occasion of their first communion had been specially blessed bythe priest. I was greatly interested to observe that from three or fourornamental crosses I was able to pick one which felt warm and living andelectric to the hand, and pass it across to her, saying, “This is your communioncross,” and it was.I remember once as a small child, picking up a dying rook; the creature laymotionless on my knee for a few minutes and then gave a flutter and died. I hadnever seen death before but I needed no one to tell me that I saw it now. The“feel” of the creature, before and after that flutter, was different, I can onlycompare the feel of the magnetised and the unmagnetised cross to the differencebetween the living and the dead bird.But the Christian is not the only religion that can magnetise its ceremonialinstruments. There are other ritualistic religions, and some of these aredebased. We ought to use much caution before we place about our rooms asornaments objects which may have been associated with cults whose nature we donot understand. Many of them, of course belong to the Brummagem cult, and arededicated to no more desperate deity than Mammon; but the genuine curio is adifferent matter.I had an example of this once in the British Museum. I was visiting the room inthe basement which contains a collection of plaster casts of the famous statuesof antiquity, the originals being elsewhere. Suddenly I became aware of a senseof magnetic power. I turned towards it, and saw a small altar. Reading thelabel, I found that this was not a cast but the original. It is a veryinteresting test of psychism to sample the atmosphere of the different rooms ofthe British Museum. The benign and brooding peace of the Buddhist Room is athing to be remembered. The flavour of the Ethnological Room is a thing to begot out of the mouth as quickly as possible. To me, at any rate, the Egyptian isdisappointing; the mummies seem neither malignant nor benignant, but merelycynical. Perhaps I should feel differently, however, if I spent a night withthem. Magnetism, which is dispersed during the day, charges up again in thesilence and darkness of the night. I remember visiting Stonehenge amid a crowdof trippers and char-a-bancs, and thinking that the glory had departed; but itwas a very different affair when I visited it in the desolation of a bleakspring day after its long winter solitude. It had charged up again and was asformidable as anyone could wish.I should hesitate, therefore, to say that because the mummies and I have neverstruck sparks when we met in the Brirish Museum, that their reputation isgroundless. At the time that Tut-ankh-amen's tomb was being opened I said tomyself, “If the mummy's curse does not work in this case, I shall lose my faithin occultism.” We all know how it has worked, even unto the third and fourthgeneration. No novelist, deriving his ideas of ancient Egypt from anencyclopaedia article on Egyptology and some photographs, would have daredstretch the long arm of coincidence anything like as far.The Egyptians attached great importance to the preservation of the physicalbody. The tombs of great men, as is well known, were protected by means of whatare popularly called spells, and the power and scope of Egyptian magic arethings that very few people realise. The modern student of occultism who readsIamblichos on the Egyptian Mysteries, will have a surprise.In most cases, however, the purchaser of Egyptian curios has nothing to fear;the worst that they will yield to psychic investigation is a vision of labourdisputes in a mass-production factory. I have, however, heard of a verywonderful psychometric reading which was obtained from a mummy which, whensubsequently unrolled, was found to consist entirely of French newspapers ofrecent date!I have always been greatly amused by the indignation of Egyptologists againsttomb robbers. After all, is there any distinction between the earlier and latervisitors to a tomb save that one lot work by day and the other by night? In theview of the people who made the tomb, and spared nothing to render it inviolateand preserve the peace of their dead, the workers by night would probably bepreferred, for they merely robbed, and did not strip and expose the nude bodiesto the public gaze. There was a terrible outcry recently when some bodies weremoved in a village churchyard to make room for the monument chosen to decoratethe grave of a famous public man. Even the people whose religious feelings werenot outraged by this act of sacrilege regarded it as in shocking bad taste. Yetnobody proposed to strip the grave cloths from the body of someone's wife ormother and photograph it stark naked. When it comes to the question of themummy's curse, I am afraid that my sympathies are entirely with the mummy.The initiate is strictly counselled that he should never blaspheme the name bywhich another knoweth his God, for it is the same force that he himself worshipsrepresented by another symbol. “The ways to God are as many as the breaths ofthe sons of men,” says the old Arab proverb. We should have enough sympathy withthe struggles of another soul towards the light not to desecrate the things thatare sanctified by his hopes and endeavours, even if by nothing else. The Fatherof us all may understand their significance better than we do, and by Hisacceptance consecrate them for ever.There are many Europeans who have a great affection for the Buddha, and have Hisstatue in their rooms (though sometimes they confuse it with Chenresi, the stoutand beaming god of good-luck). That the influence of that great Being, the Lightof Asia, is noble and benignant, I would be the last to deny; but the statues ofthe Buddha are a different matter, and need to be approached with caution ifgenuine. Some of the worst black magic in the world is a debased form ofBuddhism. To say this is not to insult that venerable faith, for it is only lackof opportunity that prevents the Black Mass from occupying that dubiouseminence. In the Tibetan monasteries of the Dugpa sect there are temples eachone of which contained literally thousands of statues of the Buddha. On variousoccasions one or another of these monasteries has been raided, either by rivalreligionists or Chinese troops, and its curios scattered. To be the possessor ofone of these Buddhas, magnetised by Dugpa rites, is not a very pleasant thing.I had a curious experience with a Buddha upon one occasion. It was an archaicsoap-stone statuette, some nine inches high, and its owner had dug it up herselfon the site of a Burmese city that had fallen in ruin and been swallowed by thejungle. It was placed on the floor in an angle of the stairs and served as adoorstop upon occasion. I had a flat on the top floor, and had to pass themelancholy little Buddha each time I came in or went out, and to me it seemed adesecration to see the sacred symbol of another faith treated thus. I tried topoint this out to her, and asked her how she would feel if she saw a crucifixthus utilised, but without result. Meanwhile the little Buddha sat therepatiently, getting the carpet-sweeper pushed in his face and receiving libationsof slops.One day, passing upstairs bearing a bunch of flowers, I was prompted to throwbefore him one of the traditional marigolds of Indian devotion. Immediately Iwas conscious that a link had been formed between myself and the little statue,and that it was sinister. A night or two afterwards I was returning home ratherlate, and as I passed the Buddha I had a feeling that there was something behindme, and looking over my shoulder, saw a ball of pale golden light about the sizeof a football separate itself from the Buddha and come rolling up the stairsafter me. Thoroughly alarmed, and disliking this manifestation very much indeed,I immediately made a banishing gesture and the ball of light returned down thestairs and was reabsorbed into the Buddha, who, needless to say, got no moremarigolds from me, and received a very wide berth until I left the flat shortlyafter. The experience was a singularly unpleasant one, and was a sharp lesson tome not to meddle with the sacred objects of another system unless I knew exactlywhat I was about. I learnt subsequently that some of these statues areconsecrated with the blood of a human sacrifice.I do not mean to imply by this that all Buddhist statues have been so treated;such consecrations are, I should imagine, comparatively rare; but I think no onewho has a knowledge of the facts will deny that they occur, even as one mightoccasionally come across a Crucifix which had been used upside down at a BlackMass.It is not every case of psychic disturbance, however, which originatesexternally. It is a well-known cosmic law that everything moves in circles, andwhatever forces we send out, and whatever thought-forms we extrude from ourauras, unless absorbed by the object to which they are directed, will return tous in due course. One of the most effective, and also one of the most widelypractised methods of occult defence is to refuse to react to an attack, neitheraccepting nor neutralising the forces projected against one, and thus turningthem back on their sender. We must never overlook the fact that a so-calledoccult attack may be evil thought-forms returning home to roost.There are certain types of insanity in which the lunatic believes himself to bethe victim of an attack by invisible beings, who threaten and abuse him andoffer base or dangerous insinuations. He will describe his tormentors, or pointto their position in the room. A psychic who investigates such a case can veryoften see the alleged entities just where the lunatic says they are.Nevertheless, the psychologist can come forward and prove beyond any reasonabledoubt that the so-called “hallucinations” are due to repressed instincts givingrise to dissociated complexes of ideas in that patient's own subconscious mind.Does this mean that the psychic is mistaken in thinking he perceives an astralentity? In my opinion both psychic and psychologist are right, and theirfindings are mutually explanatory. What the psychic sees is the associatedcomplex extruded from the aura as a thought-form. A great deal of relief can begiven to lunatics by breaking up the thought-forms that are surrounding them,but unfortunately the relief is short-lived; for unless the cause of the illnesscan be dealt with, a fresh batch of thought-forms is built up as soon as theoriginal ones are destroyed."},{"pageContent":"> 7 THE PATHOLOGY OF NONHUMAN CONTACTS > Other forms of life as well as ours Image [images/00004.jpg] Folklore and the> Fairy Kingdom Image [images/00004.jpg] Nonhumans Image [images/00004.jpg]> Esoteric data relating to conception Image [images/00004.jpg] Nonhuman souls> in human bodies Image [images/00004.jpg] The problems they present Image> [images/00004.jpg] Their deleterious effect on humans Image [images/00004.jpg]> Cause of their attractiveness to certain types of humans Image> [images/00004.jpg] Problem of single-element beings in a four-element universe> Image [images/00004.jpg] Development of elementáis through association with> magician Image [images/00004.jpg] Difficulties this may cause Image> [images/00004.jpg] Distinction from Spiritualistic controls. THERE ARE OTHER forms of life as well as ours whose sphere evolution impingesupon the earth. In the realm of folklore we constantly meet with the idea ofintercourse between the human and the fairy kingdoms; of the marriage of a humanbeing with a fairy spouse, or the theft of a child by the fairies, an impishchangeling being left in its place. We shall be rash if we assume that anextensive body of folk-belief is entirely without foundation in fact. Let ustherefore examine these old and crude beliefs and see whether we can find anygrounds for them, and if so, what the real nature of the facts may be, andwhether they throw any light upon modern psychic phenomena of the kind we areconsidering in these pages.There are many of us who have met people who might well be described asnonhuman, soulless, in that the ordinary human motives are not operative withthem, nor do the ordinary human feelings prompt or inhibit them. We cannot butlove them, for they have great charm, but we cannot but dread them as well, forthey spread an infinitude of suffering around them. Although seldom deliberatelyevil, they are singularly detrimental to all with whom they come in contact.They, for their part, are unhappy and lonely in our midst. They feel themselvesto be alien and uncompanioned; every man's hand is against them, and inconsequence it all too often happens that their hand is against everyone andthey develop a puckish malevolence, though there is seldom calculatedevil-doing. Gratitude, compassion, good faith, morality and common honesty areutterly foreign to their natures, as far beyond their conception as thedifferential calculus. They are not immoral, however, but simply non-moral. Onthe other hand, they possess the virtues of absolute sincerity and greatcourage. In terms of human ethics they are “undesirables,” but they have anethic of their own to which they are loyal, and that is the beauty which istruth, and this is all they know, and, as far as their life is concerned, allthey need to know. In appearance they are usually small and slight, possessingunusual physical strength and endurance but very liable to nervous exhaustionand brain-storms. In social relations they take violent likes and dislikes; theyshow a facile and demonstrative affection towards those they like, but quicklyforget them. Gratitude and pity are unknown to their nature. Towards those theydislike they are pettily malicious, and in all relations of life they areutterly irresponsible. One cannot describe them better than to say that theyresemble nothing so much as a blend of Persian kitten and pet monkey. They havethe beauty and aloofness and charm of the cat, and the amusing, mischievousdestructiveness of the monkey. Many human beings hate them at sight; others arefascinated by them because they bring with them a sense of unearthly beauty anda quickening of the life-forces. I have been able to investigate the history oftwo such beings, and it is interesting to note that both of them were conceivedwhile their mothers were under the influence of drink. There is a very greatdeal of information available concerning the occult aspect of the incarnation ofsouls, but not much of the knowledge concerning the actual facts of conceptionhas ever found its way into print. I have given a little in my book The EsotericPhilosophy of Love and Marriage. I cannot enter into the subject deeply in thesepages, for it would be too much of a digression. Some points, however, it isessential to touch upon for a comprehensive survey of our subject.At the moment of sexual union a psychic vortex is formed resembling awaterspout, a funnel-shaped swirling that towers up into other dimensions. Asbody after body engages, the vortex goes up the planes. In all cases thephysical, etheric and astral bodies are involved; the vortex therefore alwaysreaches as far as the astral plane; a soul upon the astral plane may be drawninto this vortex if it is ripe for incarnation, and thus enter the sphere of theparents. If the vortex extends higher than the astral plane, souls of adifferent type may enter this sphere, but such extension is rare, and thereforeit is said that man is born of desire, for few are born of anything else.But this vortex may not only extend vertically up the planes (speakingmetaphorically), but it may also, under certain conditions, be deflected, as itwere, out of the normal human line of evolution, so that its open end extendsinto the sphere of evolution of another type of life. Under such circumstancesit is theoretically possible for a being of a parallel evolution to be drawninto incarnation in a human body. Occultists hold that this occasionally occurs,and explains certain types of nonpathological abnormality which are occasionallymet with.These nonhumans are either adored or hated by their human associates. They havea peculiar fascination for certain types of temperament, the types thatpsychologists call the unstable. In these types the subconscious comes very nearto the surface, deep calls to deep, and they are instinctively drawn towards theelemental kingdoms.There is nothing more disastrous than marriage with a non-human, for they havenothing in their nature that can satisfy the normal human yearnings foraffection and sympathy. The one saving feature in such a union is that groundsfor divorce are invariably readily available, for the morals of the non-humanare those of the barnyard.The power of nonhumans to injure their enemies is comparatively small, for theyare aliens in a strange land when incarnated in human form, and cannot availthemselves of any of the ordinary human resources of mischief. They are, infact, singularly defenceless and helpless, and themselves suffer acutely, at thehands of society. It is otherwise, however, in their relations with theirfriends. They seem to have an infinite capacity for inflicting hurt on those wholove them. Not deliberately or maliciously, but like a child pulling flies topieces out of idleness not realising what it is doing. Obeying the laws of theirown nature, they are destructive to beings of the human evolution. Yet whatother laws can they obey? For them to submit to our standards is to deny theirdeepest instincts.The effect they have upon those who love them constitutes such a well-markedsyndrome among the psychic pathologies that we must consider it in detail. Theperson who forms a rapport with a nonhuman becomes deeply stirred by theelemental forces that find ingress to our sphere through the channel of thiswandering and alien soul. He becomes, as it were, drawn away from normal humanthings and set wandering upon the confines of the fairy kingdom, and yet he canfind there no rest for his foot and no sustenance for his soul. The story of thehandsome fisher lad and the mermaid is indicative of this condition. She loveshim, draws him to her and he drowns, for he cannot live in the element of water.The explanation of the curious power, both of fascination and destruction, whichis exercised by nonhumans may lie in the fact that they belong to one elementonly, whereas in man all four are combined. Any elemental contact is stimulatingto us, because elemental beings pour forth in abundance the vitality of theirown particular sphere, and this vitalises the corresponding element inourselves. But if a four-element creature is drawn into the sphere of a singleelement he is poisoned by an overdose of the one element in which he findshimself, and starved of the other three. It is for this reason that mortals inthe fairy kingdom are always said to be enchanted or asleep. They are neverliving normally in full possession of their faculties.An equally difficult problem is set to the non-human who is drawn into ourmidst. A single-element creature is bidden to control and assimilate anadditional three elements for which it has no equipment or experience, and theresult is disastrous.But it is not enough that we should merely describe the conditions and state theproblems in these pages. Our aim is essentially practical. What then can be donewhen a non-human has to be faced and dealt with? It must be clearly realisedthat any mating between a human and a non-human is a hopeless proposition. Inthe first place, it can only be the preamble to a divorce, because non-humansare promiscuous in their sexual habits; and, secondly, there is nothing in thenature of a non-human that can satisfy the higher aspirations of the human. Wemust not allow the human form to mislead us as to the existence of a human soul.A nonhuman is a pet animal, not a fellow creature. That, frankly, is the onlypossible ground upon which they can be approached. If we expect no more of themthan we should of a pet bird, if we manage them as we should manage a kitten, wehave got as near to the solution of the problem as we are ever likely to getuntil the Dark Angel mercifully restores them to their own kingdom; a mercyseldom long delayed, for nonhumans do not make old bones.Human beings may also come into touch with elemental beings by themselvesventuring into the spheres of elemental life. Such contacts need not necessarilybe harmful to either kingdom provided those who enter into them know what theyare about. In fact, such associations are frequently entered into by occultistsin the course of their work and researches, but it is an undertaking for theadvanced initiate only, not for neophytes.There are cases, however, where such an association may lead to harm. The humanpartner in the association may be ill-equipped or ill-adapted for theundertaking. He may have ventured out beyond his depth, having picked up aformula from some more experienced occultist and used it without properpreparation. Or again, it is not uncommon to find people who have broughtthrough from previous incarnations a natural aptitude for getting into touchwith the elemental kingdoms. In such cases it may occur that an elemental whohas had experience of relations with human beings may deliberately get intotouch with them. This is in every way undesirable, for the elemental has not gotthe knowledge of human conditions necessary to enable it to avoid injuring itsnew friend. In any case, elementáis have got a one-way intelligence, and it isnot well that they should be senior partners in any alliance with human beings.The whole question of elemental contacts, an exceedingly fascinating one, is tooextensive and intricate to be entered upon in these pages. It has been necessaryto refer to it, however, for certain cases of psychic difficulty may be due toinexpert operations on both sides of the Veil.These elementáis, or nature spirits, are quite different to the controls withwhom Spiritualistic circles come into touch. The Spiritualistic movement ishighly organised on the Inner Planes, and promiscuous controlling is notpermitted. Controls have, in fact, to “sit” for development in just the same waythat mediums do, and there is invariably some experienced entity within call whocan come to the assistance of the circle if all is not going well. WesternOccultism was thoroughly disorganised and broken up by centuries of persecution;its Inner Plane conditions, consequently, present many tangles and gaps even tothis day. It is nothing like as well organised as the Spiritualistic sphere. Thegreat Orders have their definite contacts and work strictly within them, keepinga firm hand on neophytes; outside the Orders there is a good deal of chaos andbanditry, and it is unwise to venture far save in the company of an experiencedoccultist who understands the technique of the methods employed.There are many people for whom the Deva Kingdom, as the sphere which theelementals share with the Nature Spirits is sometimes called, has a greatfascination, and they try by meditation and ritual to get into touch with it. Inmy opinion it is decidedly risky for a person who is not an initiate to attemptthis work. It is exceedingly apt to lead to mental unbalance, if not to actualobsession. Not that the nature contacts are evil, but they are profoundlydisturbing to the human consciousness because they stir those atavistic depthswhich the psychoanalyst aims at laying bare by means of his technique. Anyonewho is acquainted with the literature of practice of psychoanalysis knows thatthe abreaction is an important factor in this system; it is a crisis, and can,for the time being at any rate, upset the patient pretty thoroughly andexacerbate all his symptoms. When we touch the elemental contacts we get thesame reaction that is caused by psychoanalysis when the censor is beingpenetrated.Persons in whom the subconscious mind is near the surface, such as the artist,the crank, the unstable, and, for the matter of that, the genius in any walk oflife, love the elemental contacts because they stimulate the elemental forces intheir own nature which are to them the springs of their power and inspiration.But the average citizen, whose mental content is organised largely on a basis ofrepression and compromise in order that he may be a citizen at all and take hisplace in organised society, is upset by the elemental contacts according to theproportion of repression to compromise in his make-up. Compromise is the normallot of humanity; repression is the pathology of compromise. The person who hasmanaged to effect a working compromise between the different elements of hisnature can afford to allow himself a holiday with the Devas without doinganybody any harm; but the person who is repressed will find that they disagreewith him actively because they are having the same effect upon him that adrastic psychoanalysis would have. We hear sometimes of the tragedy that resultsfrom taking the last dose in a bottle of tonic of which arsenic is one of theingredients. This is due to the fact that the bottle has not been thoroughlyshaken up each time a dose has been taken, so that the arsenical sediment hasall collected in the last dose and reached a poisonous concentration. So it iswith the elemental contacts; they are a potent tonic, but they can reach apoisonous concentration under unsuitable circumstances.I have never come across or heard of a case of pathology due to the fascinationof the Element of Earth; it is not an element that usually attracts the amateurexperimenter, though the initiate appreciates its value and importance. I havecome across cases, however, of sensitive people dwelling in a mountainouscountry, especially in narrow gulches where there is a paucity of sunlight, whohave become obsessed with the fear of the mountains. They do not fear so muchthat the mountains will fall upon them as that they will close over them, as thecave closed upon the children who followed the Pied Piper of Hamelin. Thepsychiatrist will, of course, recognise this symptom as belonging to thewell-known psycho-neurosis of claustrophobia. This, however, does not invalidatemy statement; for in my opinion we may find that in a more intimate knowledge ofthe elemental kingdoms we shall come upon the clue to both claustrophobia andagoraphobia.Mountaineers also know this peculiar terror with which the great hills canobsess mankind. It is neither giddiness nor mountain sickness, but a curiousoppression of the spirits by the overwhelming grandeur of nature. The sameforce, when not at a poisonous concentration, inspires the passionate love ofthe hills or of the sea that Kipling has celebrated so gloriously in one of hispoems.The pathologies of the Element of Water may be a fascination so great that a manwill walk out into the sea until he drowns. Swinburne had this peculiarity, andhas immortalised it in several of his poems, “Strike out as the heart in us bidsand beseeches, athirst for the foam.” On one occasion he was picked up in theopen sea by a Breton fishing-smack, swimming tirelessly, many miles from land,borne on the sea by currents, but oblivious of his danger. Being rescued, he satupon the deck with his mane of red hair drying in the wind, chanting sea-poemsto his rescuers, a spectacle that one would have given much to witness.Another curious case of water-pathology I knew personally. A very level-headedwoman, a school teacher, was obsessed by a horror of rough waves. She alwaysdeclared that if she went on the sea-front to watch a storm, the waves made a“dead-set” at her. She lived at a seaside place, but so great was her dislike ofthe waves that she did not care to walk on the promenade when the tide was in.She was cured of her fear in a curious way. She took initiation into Co-Masonry,and found to her surprise that from that day forth she was free from her fear ofthe sea. I am not a Co-Mason, and speak subject to correction, but I believe Iam right in saying that Co-Masonry differs from other forms of Masonry in thatElemental Invocations have been introduced into it.The Element of Air, as all occultists know, is a very tricky element to dealwith. More initiates turn off the Path in the Grade of Air than in any other,and it is rare to see a Ritual of Air worked without something being dropped orknocked over. It is a quarrelsome element; when it is being worked, theoperators are apt to bicker and squabble. It is also intimately associated withsex, as is revealed by its symbolism. If an occultist is making a magic circle,and for any reason wishes to seal it with the Kerubim of the Elements instead ofthe Archangels, as is more commonly done, and feels himself unequal to the taskof drawing a presentable eagle, the symbolic form of the Kerub of Air, he willuse the Zodiacal sign for Scorpio. The evolutionary connection between the snakeand the bird is well known to biologists; but long ages before Darwin, initiatesused the Serpent and the Eagle to represent the unsublimated and sublimatedaspects of the life-force. The Scorpion connects with the Serpent through theDragon.I had a very curious experience myself in connection with the Element of Air. Iam betraying no secrets if I say that certain grades of initiation refer to theelements, for the fact is too generally known, and too obvious, for it to be anymore mysterious than the Queen of Spain's legs.To begin with, I have an exceptionally bad head for heights, and as the Abyss ofHeight belongs to the Element of Air, I obviously have no natural affinity withit. The ceremony went exceptionally badly even for an Air Ritual. Two of theprincipal officers, husband and wife, helped to maintain its reputation as acontentious element by having a family jar in the middle of the proceedings, andthe usual upsets and smashings occurred on a generous scale.For the next fortnight I lived in the midst of a cataclysm of crockery. Ismashed my way through two entire tea-sets and all the mantelpiece ornaments.The ornaments just fell off the mantelpiece one by one of their own accord. Iactually saw two of them do it. I did not know at the time that the Element ofAir had this sinister reputation. I realised that something queer was afoot,however, and asked my teacher about it. She was much amused, but I was not,because it was my crockery that was supplying the raw material for thephenomena. She advised me to get into sympathetic touch with the Sylphs, as theinitiation had evidently not been altogether successful. I tried to do this, butI was in London at the time and met with no success, for the elemental contacts,with the exception of Fire, cannot be worked successfully in a city. Thesmashing went on, and I was reduced to a tin mug and a tooth-glass, for I saw itwas useless to get any more china until things had settled down.Then I went away for my summer holiday and found myself on the summit of a highand isolated hill on a day of bright sun and high wind. I was very conscious ofthe nearness of the elemental kingdoms. The air seemed full of silver sparkles,which is always a sign that the veil is thin. There was no one present save somefriends who were sympathetic. I faced into the wind and raised my arms ininvocation. Suddenly we saw below us a figure bursting through hedges andleaping ditches and running wildly toward it. We presently recognised it asanother of our friends, and when he joined us he told us that he had felt thesudden rush of power while in the valley and on an overpowering impulse startedfor the hill-top. Then all of us, without any suggestion of leadership, beganthe Dance of the Elements, whirling like dancing dervishes upon that hill-top.Fortunately nobody was about, but I do not know that it would have made verymuch difference if they had been, for we were caught up out of ourselves and theair seemed full of rushing golden flames, lying level in the wind. For daysafterwards we seemed charged with elemental energy by that extraordinary dance.It may be interesting to note that we danced with a circular movement, eachrevolving on our own axis at the same time, and that we both danced and revolveddeosil, that is, with the sun. All this occurred spontaneously, the tide of theelements catching us up and away. I have never known a more glorious experience.It was indeed the divine inebriation of the Mysteries.After this there were no more smashings of crockery.I have already noted my exceptionally bad head for heights. I have found that itis considerably mitigated, temporarily at any rate, by the Invocation of Air. Iam of the opinion that the curious impulse which causes people for no reasonwhatsoever to commit suicide by throwing themselves from heights may be due tothe same impulse that causes people who are obsessed by the Element of Water toswim out to sea, as I have recorded of Swinburne.These apparently causeless suicides by Water and Air are, in my opinion, a formof union with the god which is one of the ideas underlying human sacrifice.There are two types of human sacrifice, the willing and the unwilling. Theunwilling sacrifice, the prisoner struggling or drugged into passivity, is used,not to propitiate the god, as is usually thought, but in order that his vitalforces may serve as a basis of manifestation. The willing sacrifice, in whichthe victim will be either a priest or a devotee of the god has for its motivethe idea of divine union, not altogether unknown to Christian mystics, who seekits achievement by a living death, whereas the adherents of juggernaut escapewith one brief pang.The European belief of one man, one life, has imbued us with the idea of deathas the supreme evil. Therefore the European very often does not go to his deathwhen he unites with the elements, but his higher self withdraws fromincarnation, leaving his body ensouled by a curious kind of intelligentautomaton, which deteriorates rapidly. Whatever may be the status of the soulthat withdraws, that which is left behind is not nice. I feel, therefore, thatit must seriously delay and distort the evolution of the human Monad if it turnsaside into the sphere of the Deva evolution. It may well be that some of thecreatures whom at first sight we might classify as nonhumans are really humanswho have had a Deva phase in their Karmic record. There is a very interestingfield of research awaiting the person who systematically investigates the pastlives of the weak-minded and the mentally deranged.The pathologies of the Element of Fire are also rare, though it may be that theaimless incendiary and pyromaniac belong to this class. I have never personallyhad any opportunities of investigating this type of case. Algernon Blackwoodwrites of one in his very interesting story, “The Regeneration of Lord Ernie,”which is published in his volume of short stories entitled IncredibleAdventures.Indeed, this author is exceedingly fond of drawing his inspiration from the Devakingdom, and has some most interesting studies of the subject scattered throughhis books.Any organic geographical unit develops something of an over soul, and where thedifferentiation is marked, the over soul may become a very definite entity. Ifthere are among the inhabitants of the district any who are sensitive to theUnseen, they may form either an affinity or a repulsion for this oversoul. Agreat forest has a very marked personality, and there are few white men who canresist its influence, becoming markedly changed and dehumanised if exposed to itfor long periods without the companionship of others of their race. Natives, onthe other hand, seem to enter into it and be part of it.It is well known how often trees are objects of worship in all parts of theworld. They have very marked personalities and strong magnetic fields. In thespring, when the sap is rising, even nonpsychics can often see the aura of atree. It can best be seen by getting at a distance of a couple of hundred yardsand looking at the sky beyond the top of the tree. The aura will then beperceived as a whitish cloud, like a patch of lighter-coloured sky, surroundingthe top of the tree, and usually swaying gently from side to side.There is a curious antagonism between elms and humanity, and about orchids allsensitive persons agree there is something sinister. Tropical vegetation, as awhole, is over powerful for humanity. Under the tremendous stimulation of thesolar fire the elemental forces are concentrated to a poisonous strength. I amnot personally acquainted with the West Coast of Africa, but from what I cangather I am of the opinion that the elemental forces and the atmosphere made byJuju rites are between them more responsible than the climate for earning thatpart of the world its sinister reputation as the White Man's Grave. There areother spots where the climate is equally hot and humid, Burmah, for instance,but there is no other spot that produces the same loosening of moral fibre. Theonly place that is at all comparable to it is the Caribbean Sea, which produces,not so much a demoralisation, as a fierceness and violence quite alien to theracial characteristics of the people who go there."},{"pageContent":"> 8 THE RISKS INCIDENTAL TO CEREMONIAL MAGIC > Esoteric theory of the nature of evil Image [images/00004.jpg] Qabalistic> system Image [images/00004.jpg] Negative Evil Image [images/00004.jpg]> Positive Evil Image [images/00004.jpg] The Qlippoth Image [images/00004.jpg]> Unfortunate experiment with geomancy Image [images/00004.jpg] Case of> obsession by the Abramelin demons Image [images/00004.jpg] Sources of danger> in practical occultism Image [images/00004.jpg] Accidents occurring in> ceremonial workings Image [images/00004.jpg] Accident due to the breaking of> the circle during an exorcism Image [images/00004.jpg] Strange death in island> of Iona Image [images/00004.jpg] Difference between ceremonial magic and> initiatory ceremonie Image [images/00004.jpg] Mme.

IF THE PROBLEM of psychic self-defence is to be adequately dealt with, we musthave an understanding of a subject upon which very little has been written - thenature of the forces of intelligent and organised evil.The great faiths of the ancient world all had their evil gods as well as theirbeneficent deities, and they did not call these evil gods devils. In Hinduism wehave Shiva and Kali; in the Egyptian system we have Set and Besz and Typhon; inthe Grecian pantheon there are Pluto and Hecate.All the other faiths, also, have their angelic choirs, their Archons, orbuilders, and all the hierarchy of heaven. Protestant Christianity alone hasforgotten its angelology, the Creator has to be both Architect of the Universeand Bricklayer, forming man from dust of the ground without assistance.If we refer to Paradise Lost, however, we shall find that Milton was familiarwith both divine and infernal hierarchies, and that these were graded andcharted according to a definite system. Anyone who is acquainted with theQabalah will recognise that in Milton he meets a fellow-Qabalist.In the Qabalah we find the esotericism of the Old Testament. I propose to usethe Qabalistic terminology to explain the esoteric theory of evil because,firstly, it is the one I am most familiar with; secondly, it forms the basis ofWestern occult thought and all mediaeval magic is based upon it, together withmuch modern magic; thirdly, it is, in my opinion, singularly lucid, coherent andcomprehensive; and being a system consecrated by antiquity, I cannot be accusedof romancing, or fabricating my own system.In order to render my concepts clear, a brief explanation of Qabalistic doctrinemust be given. As it is not possible to enter into an exposition of this vastsystem, I will state certain axioms dogmatically, and explain them byillustration instead of argument, thus obtaining the maximum clarity for theminimum expenditure of space.The initiate recognises two kinds of evil, Negative Evil and Positive Evil.Negative Evil is the polarising opposite of Good. Let us try and make this clearby an illustration. Every action gives rise to a reaction. The forward drive ofthe bullet is equated by the recoil of the gun. Everything which moves has tohave the equivalent of a thrust-block against which to push, something firmunder its feet from which to take off. It is difficult to walk on a slipperysurface because it offers no resistance. We must have something for the foot togrip, to push against, and give us the forward impulse at each step.Negative Evil is the thrust-block of Good; the principle of resistance, ofinertia, that enables Good to “get a purchase.”But Negative Evil is more than this. We might call the principle of resistancethe “negative” aspect of Negative Evil. For it has also a “positive” aspect, thePrinciple of Destruction.We can best explain the cosmic function of the Principle of Destruction bycalling it by its esoteric name of the Scavenger of the Gods. Its function is toclear up behind the advancing tide of evolution, removing that which has becomeeffete so that it may not choke and clog evolving life.We now find the answer to the eternal riddle as to why God tolerates the Devil.The Devil is the cosmic thrust-block and Scavenger of the Gods. It is thisaspect of evil which is given a more detailed symbolism in the pantheons ofother faiths, having its Shiva and Kali, or its Pluto and Hecate aspects. We cannow see why these resistive and destructive forces are classed as gods and notas demons, for they are reactions according to cosmic law, not anarchical andchaotic forces.We now come to the consideration of Positive Evil. This again has a “negative”and “positive” aspect. Its “negative” aspect is pure chaos, unformed substanceand uncoordinated force. It has been aptly called the Cosmic Abortion. To driftinto the sphere of “negative” Positive Evil is like being caught in a psychicquicksand.We are now ready to consider the sphere of “positive” Positive Evil, the demonsthemselves, or the Qlippoth, as they are called in the Qabalah. In order tounderstand their significance we must make a further excursion into Qabalisticphilosophy.The Creator is conceived of as bringing the universe into manifestation througha series of Divine Emanations, ten in number. These are called the Ten HolySephiroth, and are represented in a diagram as arranged in a particular pattern.This is the famous Tree of Life, the key to all symbolism.The Sephiroth were not emanated independently, each from the Divine Source; butoverflowed, the one from the other. As soon as one Sephira has emanated another,these two are said to be in equilibrium, compensating each other. But there is aperiod during the emanation of a Sephira when the force is not yet inequilibrium, but is pushing out unsupported, like an incomplete arch. It is theuncompensated force emanated during this epoch of unbalance, and neversubsequently absorbed after the establishment of the new sphere, whichconstitutes Positive Evil. There are, therefore, ten kinds of Positive Evil,just as there are ten Divine Emanations.To these spheres go, according to their kind, all the evil imaginings of theheart of man that are not neutralised by repentance or compensated by theoverplus of good in other members of the same group-soul. There is a deep occultdoctrine here which we cannot enter upon now; it must suffice to state itdogmatically in explanation of the Qabalistic conception of the Qlippoth. Whenwe consider all that must have been poured into these ten sinks of iniquitysince the days of Atlantean Magic, through the decadence of Babylon and Rome,down to the Great War, we can guess what rises up from them when their seals arebroken.Not only do influences emanate from them which tempt and corrupt souls, eachaccording to its susceptibility, but time has served for the formulation of evilintelligences. These probably originated through the workings of Black Magic,which took the essential evil essence and organised it for purposes of its own.The beings thus formulated assumed an independent existence, developed, andmultiplied their kind. They appear as dreams and hallucinations, and may producea considerable degree of objective phenomena, such as noise, deposit of slime orblood, balls of light, and, above all, stenches of an amazing pungency.The Ten Divine Emanations are personified as Archangels and the Ten InfernalEmanations are personified is Arch demons. It is these which are the Names ofPower in Magic. Each Sephira, then, has its obverse side in the correspondingQlippottic demon. The initiated adept always gains control over the demonicforce before he attempts to utilise the angelic force which, by the appropriatemeans, can be contacted in each Sephira. If he does not do so, he contacts themboth simultaneously. Moreover, the planets, the elements and the Signs of theZodiac are all intimately connected with the Sephiroth, being arranged upon theTree of Life in a pattern known only to initiates.The initiated adept is exceedingly careful what he does when he is working withthese potencies because he knows that he has always got the Qlippoth in thebackground. The uninitiated occultist goes ahead gaily, juggling with such Namesof Power as he has picked up from the innumerable books on the subject nowavailable for the general reader, thinking that if he does not invoke the demonshe will not get them. He forgets that every planet is a Jekyll and Hyde.Consequently, ceremonial magic has got a bad name owing to the unpleasantfrequency of untoward results, just as surgery got a bad name before the days ofLister. It is the imperfect technique that is the trouble.I was once doing some experimental work with geomancy, which is a method ofdivination belonging to the Element of Earth. Now all divinations, whenperformed according to their esoteric formulae, always begin with an evocationof the genius that presides over that particular operation. The genii ofgeomancy are not of a very high type. I was imperfectly familiar with themethod, and was trying to set up my prick-figure on a piece of paper instead ofusing a tray of wet sand as I should have done. Things began to go wrong, andthe room was filled with the most terrible stench of drains. The appropriatebanishing ritual was immediately performed, and the air cleared; but there wasnot much doubt about the objectivity of this phenomenon while it lasted.A very interesting case is given in the Occult Review for December 1929, in aletter to the editor signed H. Campell.“Desiring some information which I could not get in any ordinary way, I resortedto the System of Abramelin, and to this end prepared a copy of the necessaryTalisman, perfecting it to the best of my ability with my little stock ofknowledge. The ritual performed, I proceeded to clear my place of working.' Alittle knowledge is a dangerous thing; my ritual was imperfect and I onlyrendered the Talisman useless without in any way impairing the activities of theentity invoked. This looks like nothing else than gross carelessness on my part;and to a certain extent this is true -but the point I wish to make is this, thatmy knowledge of this particular system, and therefore my ritual, were imperfect;and in any case, I had been shown no method of combating this particular entitywhen once aroused. Now note the results.“Unfortunately I have no account of the date when these occurrences began, butthe first hint of trouble must have come on or about March 3, 1927. I can guessthe date with fair accuracy because, as I was to learn, the manifestations werealways strongest about the new moon, and after I had gone to sleep. Upon thisoccasion I can remember waking up suddenly with a vague feeling of terroroppressing me; yet it was no ordinary nightmare terror, but an imposed emotionthat could be thrown off by an effort of the will. This passed almost as soon asI stood up, and I thought no more about it.“Again on April 2, or thereabouts, I was troubled by the same feeling, butregarded it as nothing more than a severe nightmare, though the fact that mysleep was distorted towards the time of the new moon had occurred to me; whileas full moon drew on, the nights were peaceful again.The new moon of May 1 brought a recurrence of the trouble. This time very muchmore powerful, and necessitated an almost intolerable effort of will to cast itoff. Also it was about this time that I first saw the entity which was rapidlyobsessing me. It was not altogether unlovely to look at. Its eyes were closedand it was bearded, with long flowing hair. It seemed a blind force slowlywaking to activity.“Now there are three points which I must make quite clear before I proceed. Inthe first place, I was never attacked twice in the same night. Secondly, when Ispeak of physical happenings, the smashing of glass and voices, they were never,with one absolutely inexplicable exception, actual, but pure obsessions; andthis leads to the third point. Not one of these incidents happened while I wasasleep. Always I found myself awake with the terror upon me and strugglingviolently to cast off the spell. I have had nightmares before, but no nightmarethat I have ever had could hold my mind in its grip for minutes at a time asthis thing did, or send me plunging through a ten-foot-high window to the groundbelow.“The first indication I had that these visitations were absolutely out of theordinary course of events came on May 30. About midnight I was suddenly awakenedby a voice calling loudly, ‘Look out,’ and at once I became aware of a redserpent coiling and uncoiling itself under my bed, and reaching out onto thefloor with its head. Just at it was about to attack me I jumped through mywindow, and came to earth among the roses bushes below, fortunately with no moredamage than a badly bruised arm.“After this there was absolute peace until June 30, when the real climax came. Ihad seen the thing again on the night of the new moon, and had noticedconsiderable changes in its appearance. Especially it seemed far more active,while its long hair had changed into serpent heads. The night after I wasawakened by a violent noise and jumped out of bed. I then saw the noise wascaused by a great red obelisk which crashed through the west wall of my room andleaned against the wall at the east end, smashing both that and the window topieces but missing my bed, which was in an alcove to the left of its path. Inits transit it had smashed all the mirrors, and the floot and top of my bed werestrewn with broken glass and fragments of wood. This time the obsession musthave lasted some minutes, I dared not move for fear of cutting myself, and toreach the matches - wherein, I knew, lay safety - I had to lean across the bedand again risk the glass. Yet in my heart I knew that all this was false, buthad no power to move. I could only stand there, incapable, looking at theshattered room in a state of hopeless terror.“And now comes the most extraordinary part of the whole business. When I hadfinally mastered the obsession, I went to bed again dead tired, and I know thatthe only sound I made that night was jumping to the floor, also my room is atleast a hundred yards from the rest of my family, yet next morning at breakfastI was asked what was the terrible noise in my room during the night.After that I realised that the game was up. I had not taken these occurrenceslying down, but I knew that it was impossible for me to try and control theforce which I had set in motion. In desperation I turned to a good friend, who,I was aware, knew much of these things. She did not hesitate, but came at onceto my assistance, and from that day to the present the trouble has absolutelygone from me.“Such is the case; and I only hope it may warn those who are contemplating myfolly to treat with the greatest of care any printed systems of magic, and notto use them at all unless they have the fullest control over the entitiesinvoked.”Among the general public, who do not dabble in occultism, the results of amagical mishap are never seen, and the only doctors, who ever see them arefellow-initiates who happen to be medical men, and they, naturally, keepsilence. The catastrophes are of varying degrees of severity, ranging from a badfright to a fatality.I cannot say much upon these subjects, for they are among the most secret pathsof occult lore. Enough must be hinted, however, to reveal what, under certaincircumstances, may be experienced. I do not think it in the least likely,however, that the Qlippotic demons will be encountered save through the use ofceremonial magic. They are rare as anthrax in England, but it is as well to knowthe manner of their manifestation so that, when encountered, they may berecognised.The great majority of dabblers in occultism are protected by their owninaptitude. They fail to get results, and consequently come to no harm; but ifthey should succeed in getting results they would find that they had their handsfull. The serious student, unless he is working under skilled guidance, may alsofind himself in difficulties, and for various reasons.He may be insufficiently experienced in the operation he has undertaken, for inmagic theory is one thing and practice is another. A student of occult sciencewill often take a formula out of a book and try to use it. He might just as wellstudy the instructions in a book on surgery and try to operate. Most formulaeare incomplete, there is always unwritten work. Some of the “barbarous names ofevocation” which the uninitiated use as Words of Power, are really the initialletters of a mantric sentence or formula. I came across an invocation once inwhich the Word of Power was Tegatoo. On investigation this turned out to be thebattered remains of The Great Architect Of The Universe.Even an experienced occultist may get into difficulties if he attempts magicalwork when he is in bad health, over-tired, or has had even a moderate amount ofalcohol, for very little is too much when the Invisible Forces are beinghandled. Equally does this apply to each of his assistants. A chain is nostronger than its weakest link, and if one of the team cannot handle the forces,everybody is going to suffer. A ritual lodge is no place for the well-meaningineffectual.There is an immense amount of dabbling in occultism going on today. Most of itis innocuous because it is totally ineffective; but there is never any knowingwhen one is going to strike a live wire. Take, for instance, the advertisers invarious occult papers who offer to supply “charms that work.” One of two thingsis certain. Either they do not work at all, in which case one is wasting one'smoney on them; or they work by means of some power with which they have beencharged. What is the nature of that power, and did the persons who made thecharm or talisman really know what they were about? Did they take the precautionto bind the baser aspect before magnetising with the higher aspect?These are the elementary precautions of the practical occultist who has beenproperly trained. Did the maker of the talisman know them?Again, one buys second-hand books on magic. Who was the previous owner and forwhat purposes were these books used? Or one buys a new book which has beenbrought out by some occult school for propaganda purposes. Those books are oftenmagnetised before they are sent out, and so form a magnetic link between thepurchaser and the Order which caused them to be issued.Or someone may join a group who has previously been associated with anotheroccult group whose contacts were debased. Unless the proper precautions aretaken, that person will bring the psychic contagion in with him, and hisfellow-members may have unpleasant experiences.I well remember it being said to me by an occultist of great experience that twothings are necessary for safety in occultism, right motives and rightassociates. We lull ourselves into a false security if we believe that goodintentions are sufficient protection. My advice to the would-be student is toinvoke the Master to send him an initiator, and to refuse to attempt anypractical work until he is fully satisfied that the initiator has been found.I cannot here enter into either the precautions to be taken against untowardhappenings in practical occult work, nor the remedies to apply if they takeplace; I will merely indicate the signs by which such an eventuality may berecognised. This is all that can be done, and all that is necessary in a book ofthis type; the initiate knows what to do without need of guidance from me; thenon-initiate cannot do anything, and must seek assistance. It is enough for himif he knows when such assistance is needed.If things go wrong in the course of a magical ceremonial, the power “shorts,”and someone, it may be the operator, or it may be the weakest person in theteam, gets “knocked out” as if he had received a punch from an invisiblepugilist. When picked up, he will be very dazed and badly shaken, and willcertainly be some days, possibly weeks, before he gets over it. He will be in astate of complete prostration and considerable mental confusion, which willgradually wear off. Unless there is some organic defect, such as hereditarymental instability, a bad heart, or hardened arteries, there will be a completerecovery, given time but naturally it is a bad outlook should one of theseconditions be present, and those who have them should not take part in occultexperiments. Personally, I do not believe that the invisible forces alone willever actually cause the loss of life or permanent disability in the absence ofany physical lesion. The person who goes out of his mind as the result of apsychic shock would have gone out of his mind if he had been in a railwaydisaster or any other drastic emotional experience.Unless the psychic atmosphere indicates otherwise, it is not necessary to do anybanishings, or take precautions against obsession, because the power hasdispersed itself in the very act of inflicting the shock.During my early days of occultism I developed my powers very rapidly because Irecovered the memories of previous incarnations en bloc, and with them thecapacities acquired in previous lives, and I shook myself up severely onnumerous occasions before I learnt the technique of handling the invisibleforces. I never experienced any permanent ill-effects from my mishaps, though Iadmit that upon occasion I have been extricated by my friends from aconsiderable amount of debris.During the early days of my occult career a girl was brought to me by a mutualfriend, who told me that the mother of this girl, an ardent student ofoccultism, seemed to have a terrible effect upon her daughter. The mother was awidow, and mother and daughter lived together under very comfortable materialcircumstances; but whenever the girl made a friend, or showed any desire toleave home, the mother performed extraordinary antics, coming to the daughter'sroom at night and drawing signs in the air about her bed. The effect of all thisupon the girl was most peculiar. She felt unable to free herself from the mentaldomination the mother had obtained over her, and she was wasting away in a mostcurious fashion. When I saw her, although able to get about, she looked likenothing I have ever seen save a famine victim.I made a psychic investigation, and formed the opinion that the mother wasworking by means of an entity of which she had obtained possession. How this hadbeen accomplished in the present instance, I do not know, but such things arecommon in occultism. I determined to take on the case, and to chase and, ifpossible, break up this artificial elemental. I was away from the group I wasaccustomed to work with, but among people keenly interested in occultism ofevery sort, size and description, and I had no difficulty in picking up a teamto help me with the undertaking.I had no qualms about the undertaking. A second-hand elemental, directed by awoman with only a rule-of-thumb knowledge of magic, did not appear to me to be aformidable opponent. I had seen a good deal of practical occultism, had lent ahand at similar operations and possessed the necessary formulae. So I went roundthe town, asked certain friends to lend a hand, and others to come and see thefun. To be frank, our attitude was that of a party of small boys going ratting.We met at the appointed time and place. Formed our circle, and went to work. Themethod I meant to use made it necessary for me to leave my body, and the groupwere really there to look after it while I was out of it, and see it came to noharm. I got out on to the astral readily enough, did my job, and returned,feeling very pleased with myself, for it was the first time I had operatedentirely on my own, without the supervision by my teacher.As I began to recover physical consciousness, which is just like coming roundfrom an anaesthetic, I had a sensation as of machinery running, and felt as if Iwere lying on something very lumpy. I opened my eyes, and saw something browntowering above me to an enormous height. As I gathered my senses together, Idiscovered that I was lying on the floor, close to the skirting, across the feetof an unfortunate man, who was thus securely pinned against the wall, and it washe, shaking in his shoes, that had felt to me like the vibration of machinery.Various other members of the circle slowly and reluctantly reappeared frombehind the piano and sofa and other heavy articles of furniture. They had seensome practical occultism for once in their lives, but they did not appear tolike it.It appears that, after I had gone out and left them with my unconscious body,they got a good deal of phenomena in the way of bells and voices outside thecircle. If they had kept quiet, it would have been quite all right, but theylost their heads and scattered. Then, the circle being broken, I began toperform antics, arching up on my head and my heels and, in some way that hasnever been explained, arriving at the far side of the room at the feet of one ofthe circle, which, of course, did not improve matters.Then an extraordinary thing happened. We were just gathering ourselves together,thinking that everything was over, when a force of what nature I have neverknown suddenly rushed round the circle, and one member seemed to take the bruntof it. He went flying across the room and landed, fortunately for him, facedownwards in an arm-chair, and was ill in bed for three weeks.While all this was going on, the father of one of the people taking part becameuneasy about her, and walked across from where he lived at the far side of thelittle town, to see what was happening. Like most little country towns, this oneusually went to bed early, but he told us that as he came along he saw thatinnumerable windows were lit up, and he heard the sounds of children crying alldown the street.When I think of the risks I took and the conditions under which I worked inthose early days, I wonder that I or any of my friends are alive to tell thetale. It is said that there is a special Providence to look after fools,drunkards and little children. I think there must be another that looks afterinexperienced occultists and their friends.It may be interesting to note that as a result of this operation which I sorashly undertook, the girl was entirely freed from the domination of her mother,and began forthwith to put on flesh and rapidly became normal. That end of it,at least, was entirely successful.Another very curious case is that referred to in the Occult Review of January,1930.“The mysterious death of a student of occultism, Miss N. Fornario, is receivingthe attention of the authorities at the present time. Miss Fornario was foundlying nude on the bleak hill-side in the lonely island of Iona. Round her neckwas a cross secured by a silver chain, and near at hand lay a large knife whichhad been used to cut a large cross in the turf. On this cross her body waslying. A resident of London, Miss Fornario seems to have made her way to Ionafor some purpose connected with occultism. One of the servants at her house inLondon stated that a letter had been received saying she had a ‘terrible case ofhealing on.’ One newspaper report alludes to ‘mysterious stories on the islandabout blue lights having been seen in the vicinity of where her body was found,and there is also a story of a cloaked man.’ Occultists no less than the generalpublic will await with interest any disclosures that may be forthcomingconcerning this occurrence.”No disclosures ever were forthcoming, however, and conjecture alone can workupon the case. One detail only can I add to the brief but comprehensive reportof the Occult Review. The body bore marks of scratches.I knew Miss Fornario intimately, and at one time we did a good deal of worktogether, but some three years before her death we went our separate ways andlost sight of each other. She was half Italian and half English, of unusualintellectual calibre, and was especially interested in the Green Ray elementalcontacts; too much interested in them for my peace of mind, and I became nervousand refused to cooperate with her. I do not object to reasonable risks, in factone cannot expect to achieve anything worth while in life if one will not takerisks, but it appeared to me that “Mac,” as we called her, was going into verydeep waters, even when I knew her, and that there was certain to be troublesooner or later.She had evidently been on an astral expedition from which she never returned -She was not a good subject for such experiments, for she suffered from somedefect of the pituitary body. Whether she was the victim of psychic attack,whether she merely stopped out on the astral too long and her body, of poorvitality in any case, became chilled lying thus exposed in mid-winter, orwhether she slipped into one of the elemental kingdoms that she loved, even asSwinburne swam out to sea, who shall say ? The information at our disposal isinsufficient for an opinion to be formed. The facts, however, cannot bequestioned, and remain to give sceptics food for thought.It may be as well to say in concluding this chapter, that when I speak of theexperiments of ceremonial magic, I do not mean ritual initiation. Now a ritualinitiation is of course ceremonial magic, and so, for the matter of that, arethe sacraments of the Church. But the occultist, using his terms perhapssomewhat loosely, does not include the initiatory rituals when he speaks ofceremonial magic.There are many varieties of initiatory ceremonies, but these are all designed towork upon the soul of the candidate only. Ceremonial magic, on the other hand,in the technical sense of the term, is designed to work upon the soul of nature.The two operations, although there are innumerable forms of each, are entirelydifferent in type, and aim at, and achieve, entirely different results.There is a strong prejudice against ritual magic among those interested inpopular occultism owing to the strictures passed upon it by Mme. Blavatsky. NowMme. Blavatsky was trained in the Eastern School and had very little, if any,practical acquaintance with the inner aspects of Western Occultism, nor was shea master of its methods. She spoke from an Eastern standpoint and judged Westernesoteric conditions by those she had seen in the East, where Tantric magic hasbecome depraved in the hands of Dugpas and similar sects.In the dense and materialistic atmosphere of the West it is exceedinglydifficult to get any results worth mentioning without the use of some form ofceremonial. Even the Theosophical Society, of which she was the foundress, hasunconsciously drifted into Western methods, adopting the Catholic ceremonial andthe Masonic initiations as side chapels to its main temple, and the mixture isgiving trouble. The “Back to Blavatsky” movement within its ranks may be able toproduce a much purer ethical and metaphysical teaching, but I think we maysafely prophesy it will produce no practical results, in Europe at any rate.Ought we to eschew ceremonial methods because occasionally, in inexpert hands orunder unsuitable conditions, they lead to disastrous results? Ought we to eschewmotor racing, or mountaineering, or flying, or research into the nature ofradioactive substances? All these take their toll of life each year. There is anunjustifiable risk which no level-headed person will run if they can help it,and there is a justifiable risk which everybody must be prepared to take whowants to come out of the luck. It is not every follower of the Inner Way who issuitable for ceremonial work, just as it is not every individual who is fittedto handle the controls of an aero plane; but there are some people, both men andwomen, to whom a spice of danger is a spur which brings out the mettle of theirpasture, and these will always be found in the van of great adventure."},{"pageContent":"> 9 DISTINCTION BETWEEN OBJECTIVE PSYCHIC ATTACK AND SUBJECTIVE PSYCHIC> DISTURBANCE > Psychism a frequent cause of self-delusion Image [images/00004.jpg]> Unexpectedly rapid development of students sometimes leads to emotional> disturbance Image [images/00004.jpg] Recovery of distressing memories of a> previous incarnation Image [images/00004.jpg] Findings of inexperienced> psychics to be accepted with caution Image [images/00004.jpg] “Old maid's> insanity” Image [images/00004.jpg] Reactions to fixations Image> [images/00004.jpg] Magnetism of an adept too potent for many people Image> [images/00004.jpg] The fraudulent Image [images/00004.jpg] The insane Image> [images/00004.jpg] The sex-cycle in relation to mental unbalance Image> [images/00004.jpg] Case of cyclic insanity Image [images/00004.jpg] The best> test for genuineness is to be found in an examination of motives Image> [images/00004.jpg] Case of delusions of persecution Image [images/00004.jpg]> Examples of genuine psychic attacks for comparison with bogus ones Image> [images/00004.jpg] Need for caution in making a diagnosis. PSYCHISM, HOWEVER genuine, is a fruitful cause of self-delusion. A psychic isinvariably highly sensitive and suggestible. This is the basis of his gifts.Psychism not being a normal development, among Europeans at any rate, thepsychic is, in the language of nautical engineers “over-engined for his hull.”He is consequently unstable, liable to violent emotional reactions, and ingeneral exhibits those aberrations of conduct we are accustomed to associatewith artistic genius. Unless a psychic is trained, disciplined, protected andwatched over by those who understand his condition, his psychism is neverreliable because he is blown about by every wind of influence. The psychic andthe neurotic are closely akin in their reactions to life, but the neuroticdiffers from the psychic in that, instead of being over-engined for his hull, heis under-hulled for his engines. The result is the same, however, a discrepancybetween the force and form with the consequent inability to maintain a central,reasoned, directing control. The technique of the occult discipline is largelydirected towards maintaining control of the, disparate forces, compensating thesensitiveness of the psychic, and protecting him from unwanted impressions. Itis never well to learn how to open the door of the Unseen unless at the sametime one learns how to close and latch it.As was noted in the Introduction, it is comparatively seldom that the Unseencomes in search of human beings. As the Caterpillar told Alice concerning thePuppy-dog, “You let it alone, and it will let you alone.” But if we begin tostudy occultism, or even to dabble in it, sooner or later we are liable toobtain results, provided, of course, that the system we are using contains thegerms of efficacy.In the case of a person who is coming on to the Path for the first time,progress is necessarily slow and laborious; but a soul that has taken initiationin previous incarnations may re-open the latent psychic faculties so rapidlythat the problem of maintaining the harmonised coordination of the personalitybecomes a serious one. It is exceedingly common for a person who is making hisfirst contact with the occult movement to experience psychic disturbance. Thisis sometimes attributed to evil influences, sometimes to evil entities. Neitherof these inferences may be just. There is a third possibility, which isresponsible for by far the greater percentage of victims - the mere fact thatconsciousness is being disturbed by an unaccustomed force. How common a thing itis to see a child feverish and fretful during the first few days of a seasideholiday. It is not necessarily sickening for an illness. The strong air andunaccustomed food and the excitement of its new surroundings are disturbing itssensitive physical equilibrium. So it is when the neophyte is disturbed at theoutset of his occult career. The unaccustomed vibrations are upsetting him, andhe is having an attack of occult indigestion. In both cases the treatment is thesame-temporary restriction of the diet which has caused the disturbance.Another cause of psychic upset may lie in the partial recovery of the memoriesof past incarnations if these include any painful episodes, especially such asare connected with esoteric studies. The entry of occult concepts into theconscious mind tends to awaken the subconscious memory of similar experiences inpast lives. The emotion surrounding a memory is invariably recovered before theactual image of the incident. (This is one of the best tests for the accuracy ofmemories of past lives.) This foreshadowing emotion may hang about for a longtime on the threshold of consciousness before the images clarify sufficiently tobecome tangible. If the emotion that is rising over the horizon is of a painfulnature it may cause considerable disturbance, and in the absence of anexperienced adviser may be attributed to an occult attack, or to the psychicperception of evil influences in the occult group to which the neophyte isaffiliated. It is necessary to use very great caution in drawing conclusionsfrom the psychic impressions of an inexperienced student, who is apt to be asfull of alarms as a two-year-old thoroughbred.On the other hand, the instinctive reactions of a pure and sensitive soul arenot to be ignored. There are such things as Black Lodges and evil entities. Wemust not allow the cry of “Wolf! Wolf!” to make us either callous or careless.In any case, the victim is suffering remediable discomfort.It is an exceedingly difficult thing to determine psychically whether thecomplainant has reasonable grounds for his feelings, for his own imaginationwill have filled his atmosphere with menacing thought-forms. It is no simplematter to decide whether these thought-forms are subjective or objective. Thewisest way is to rely on such evidence as is capable of objective examination,and enquire into the record of the particular group or occultist against whomthe charges are being brought. But it is equally necessary to enquire into therecord of the person who is bringing the charges. That that person is filledwith the loftiest ideals is no proof that he has a level head, a clear andunbiassed judgment, or appreciation of the nature of evidence. A person need notbe a deliberate liar to make statements that are very far from the truth.Another factor which has to be reckoned with is the vagaries of the sex instinctin a person in whom that instinct is repressed. Consider the case of a woman,perhaps no longer young, whose circumstances for the first time permit her tofollow her own inclinations; a very common case with home-keeping women, whohave to wait for dead men's shoes before they can set out on life's journey. Shetakes up occultism, towards which she may always have had a leaning, and joinssome circle for study and possible ritual initiation. The leader of that circlewill in all probability be a person of strong individuality. The inexperienced,love-starved new-comer is glamoured. Ritual is a very stimulating thing, asAnglo-Catholic clergy have found to their cost. The woman, possibly quiteignorant of the facts of life, finds herself strangely stirred. She isfrightened, she senses that something of the Kingdom of Pan is approaching. Herinstincts will usually guide her truly enough in divining the source from whichthe disturbing influence proceeds. She will point an unerring finger at themagnetic male. She will seldom take into account the reactions of the female inthe presence of the male.If she is a woman ignorant of the facts of life, the charge she brings willusually take the form of an accusation of hypnotic influence. She does notrealise that nature is the hypnotist. If she is a woman who knows something ofthe world, the charge may be of improper advances. One glance at the woman isusually enough to tell us whether there is likely to be any foundation in thischarge or not. It is seldom the young and pretty girl, who might reasonably beapprehensive, who is the teller of these stories. It is a curious fact that itnever seems to occur to the complainants either to take refuge in flight or purthe matter in the hands of a solicitor. If, at the end of a long tale full ofdark hints and unspeakable innuendos, the question is asked, “What exactly didhe do?” the answer usually is, “He looked at me in a meaning way.”When one of these stories is being told we should be wise to give more attentionto the bearing of the person who is telling it than to the facts alleged. Thiswill usually yield the more valuable information. It is the most difficult thingin the world to get a genuine victim to speak. A woman who is broadcasting thetale of her own shame is usually a woman scorned, and the reliability of hertestimony in the matter is in inverse ratio to her loquacity. Do not let usforget that it takes two to make a scandal as well as a quarrel, and the personwho admits a mistake and asks for help to retrace wandering footsteps is muchmore likely to be worth helping than the one who claims to be even as the angelsin heaven, where there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage.So great is the need for caution in assessing the facts in a charge ofimmorality that the law courts will not accept the evidence of the victim, evenon oath and under cross-examination, unless it is supported by additionaltestimony. Equally well does the doctor know the same type of mentality, and acommon form of mental derangement is called Old Maid's Insanity, even in thetextbooks.I could cite cases by the dozen in exemplification of the preceding statements,but they have not sufficient occult interest to justify their inclusion in thesepages.If the leader of the group is a woman, a different set of reactions come intoplay though the same causes are at work. It is not generally realised that thefixation, or “crush” of one woman for another is really a substitute loveaffair, as is proved by the fact that the girl who has plenty of admirers, orthe woman who is happily married is never given to them. In this case, just asmuch as in the normal, heterosexual attraction, “hell knows no fury like a womanscorned”; it is not, for obvious reasons, possible to bring charges of improperbehaviour. (Though in one accusation this was alleged against me, and I wasaccused of being a man in disguise and attempting to seduce the complainant, andthe charge found believers.) The charge brought in such cases usually takes oneof two forms, the mechanism being either, “You don't love me, therefore you arecruel. I have been badly treated”; and the most far-fetched instances are rakedup in support of this charge. Or, “You don't love me, therefore I hate you. Theattraction you have for me is hypnotic.”It must be borne in mind in assessing these charges that a trained occultist,especially if of high grade, has an exceedingly magnetic personality, and thisis apt to prove disturbing to those who are unaccustomed to high-tension psychicforces. For whereas the person who is ripe for development will unfold thehigher consciousness rapidly in the atmosphere of a high-grade initiate, theperson who is not ready may find these influences profoundly disturbing. Anadept who allows unsuitable persons to enter his magnetic field is blameworthyfor his lack of discrimination and discretion, but he cannot justly be chargedwith abuse of occult powers. He emanates force involuntarily and cannot helphimself. The greater adepts always live in seclusion, for not only do they needsolitude for their work, but their influence upon unprepared souls produces tooviolent a reaction, and it ends in the Cross or the hemlock cup.We must not be unmindful of the fact that the person who comes to us with a longtale of occult attack and asks for assistance, especially financial assistance,may simply be “pitching a yarn,” and should use the same discrimination that wewould in listening to any other “hard-luck story,” trying to differentiatebetween the deserving and the undeserving. I knew a man who allowed an allegedadept who was undergoing an alleged occult attack to take refuge in his studio,and returned after a short absence to find that the alleged one had been sellingthe furniture to buy drink; and there was every reason to believe that the onlyspirits who were in any way concerned with his troubles had entered the studioin bottles.The complaints of occult attack may have their source in nothing more or lessthan the delusions of the insane, and it does not necessarily invalidate thisfact that a second person can be found to give supporting evidence. There is acurious form of insanity known to alienists called folic de deux, in which twopeople intimately associated together share the same delusions. It is usuallyfound in such cases that one is definitely insane, and that the other is of ahysterical type and has become imbued with the delusions of her associate bymeans of suggestion. I use the feminine pronoun because this form of insanity israre with males. It usually occurs with two sisters, or with two women livingtogether.There is another pitfall for which the inexperienced do well to watch out intheir dealings with the person who complains of an occult attack. Insanity maybe periodic in its manifestation, outbreaks of acute mania alternating withperiods of complete sanity. This periodic aspect should always be watched for inthe case of women, in whom any temperamental instability becomes greatlyexaggerated during the times of monthly periods, at the change of life, duringpregnancy, and, in fact, at any period when the sex life is stirred to activity,whether emotionally or physically. It is also well to bear in mind that inpathological cases the periodicity of a woman's function may be greatlydisturbed.I had a sharp lesson in this respect upon one occasion, which exemplifies theneed of caution. We had, at the introduction of one of our members, receivedinto one of our community houses a woman whose husband, a well-known man inpublic life, refused to live with her, so I was told, and had made severalattempts to do away with her, and Threatened to have her certified insane if shein any way resisted him. These facts were vouched for by a circle of friends towhom both husband and wife were known. I kept this lady under observation for amonth in order to see whether there was anything to justify the charge ofinsanity, and seeing nothing, took up her case. At the seventh week, however,trouble ensued. She got into a great state of excitement, declared that she wasbeing starved, and ill-treated by the person who, in my absence, was responsiblefor the house. Seven weeks later we had another bout, in which she said thatevil influences were proceeding from a certain cupboard in her room, wanderedabout the house in exceedingly inadequate apparel, and lost all self-control.This attack also passed off in a few days. It came out in the end that shesuffered from chronic appendicitis which involved the right ovary, and wheneverher exceedingly irregular menstruation occurred, she went right off her head fora few days. The position was greatly complicated by the fact that in theinterregnum she was to all outward appearances perfectly sane. After she leftour community house she told exactly the same stories about us that she hadpreviously been telling about her husband. The out-and-out lunatic is a muchless serious problem to society than these border-line cases. They need dealingwith extremely cautiously, for they can cause an immense amount of trouble.When an insanity has once become well developed anyone who has had experience oflunatics has little difficulty in recognising it. Each type of insanity has itscharacteristic facial expression and even gait. But it is not so simple a matterfor even the expert to recognise an insanity in its incipient stages. Lunaticsare exceedingly plausible, and if they have picked up something of the jargon ofthe occultist or spiritualist, can make out an extraordinarily good case forthemselves. Even the experienced alienist often has to keep a case underobservation in order to ascertain whether it is an actual insanity or not.In a field where experts are frequently in doubt, what is the layman to do whofinds himself confronted by a case which rouses his suspicions? He cannot beexpected to recognise insanity when he sees it, but his own common sense oughtto be sufficient to enable him to recognise sanity. In other words, let himsuspend judgment upon the alleged facts and concentrate upon the question ofmotive. It is here he will find his best indication. If a person can offer novalid explanation as to the reasons for the attack that is being made upon him,nor as to its cause or origin, we can probably rest assured that it originatesin his own imagination.In one case which came into my hands for help, the victim declared that he wasbeing persecuted by telepathic suggestion. I enquired as to the origin of thispersecution, and he said that some people who lived in the next flat used to sitin a circle and concentrate upon him. I asked him why they did this. He did notknow. I asked him how he knew they did it, and he could not tell me. He merelyreiterated that they did it, although he admitted that he had never been insidetheir flat, never, in fact, even spoken to them except to exchange a goodmorning on the stairs. It was immediately apparent that there was no conceivablemotive that could cause these people to go to the trouble of persecuting him. Ifanyone has ever tried any experiments with telepathic suggestion, they will knowwhat intense concentration it requires, and, in fact, what hard work it is, andone cannot possibly imagine anybody putting themselves to the trouble of doingit over long periods of time without a very definite motive. I have, however,heard of a well-authenticated case of a woman, who had a liaison with a marriedman, attacking his wife in this way. I have also myself known of two cases inwhich a certain individual, at one time prominent in transcendental circles, inconnection with what the newspapers impolitely called his “Prayer Shop,” andequally well known in the City in connection with his efforts to obtain goldfrom sea-water, used telepathic suggestion in order to induce the signing ofcheques and documents. Before a visitor was expected for an interview, he wouldsit down and concentrate upon him. So strong was the influence thus exerted thata man of my acquaintance threw up a post he held under him because of the unduemental influence he felt was being exerted over himself, and another resignedoff the board of one of his companies for the same reason.In both these cases an adequate motive for the mental attack is not far to seek.Compare these two cases with the previous one, and the difference can readily beperceived. We should, however, be just as cautious in deciding there is nothingwrong as in accepting at their face value any statements that may be made to us.Moreover, we should always bear in mind when dealing with a person who isobviously mentally unbalanced and who alleges a psychic attack, that the mentalunbalance may have been induced by the psychic attack. Life is a strange thingat best, and many things that are stranger than usual can happen to those whomove in occult circles."},{"pageContent":"> PART II> DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS "},{"pageContent":"> 10 NON-OCCULT DANGERS OF THE BLACK LODGE > Black Lodges connect with the underworld Image [images/00004.jpg] Kinds of> crime usually associated with Black Lodges Image [images/00004.jpg] Necessary> precautions Image [images/00004.jpg] Character and record of occult teachers> Image [images/00004.jpg] Truth periodical - Blackmail Image [images/00004.jpg]> Undue influence Image [images/00004.jpg] Drugs Image [images/00004.jpg]> Immorality Image [images/00004.jpg] Danger to boys - Human sacrifice Image> [images/00004.jpg] Revolutionary politics Image [images/00004.jpg] Signs of a> Black Lodge. THE FACTS CONSIDERED in the previous chapter, though they should make usexceedingly careful in weighing evidence, must not blind us to the fact thatthere are black sheep in every fold and that a fraternity which started out withthe best intentions may quite inadvertently, through the ignorance orimperfections of its leaders, begin to drift on to the Left-hand Path. Perfectlyinnocent people enter it when it is in process of drifting but not yet avowedlyblack and may find themselves in waters that are unpleasantly dirty, even if notactually dangerous.The esoteric dangers will be studied in detail in the next chapter, but we mayvery well consider in this place the exoteric dangers which may occur behind theVeil of the Temple, for human nature is much the same wherever we meet it, andshows little originality in choosing its road to the Pit. It might be thoughtthat in such a book as this there were no need to touch upon these matters, butif this book is to serve the purpose for which it is intended, it is necessaryto do so for three reasons; firstly, because the greater proportion of thestudents of esotericism are women, and even in these enlightened days they areusually ignorant of the life of the underworld, and a Black Lodge leads by astraight and narrow way into the land of apaches and demi-mondaines, quite apartfrom its other drawbacks. Secondly, a knowledge of these facts is essential fordifferential diagnosis. Thirdly, occult powers are not infrequently used toobtain purely mundane ends, therefore when the question of ordinary criminalityoccurs in connection with an occult organisation, the issue may be complicatedby an admixture of methods that belong to another plane.We must always remember that a lodge may not necessarily have been formed forthe express purpose of evading the law; it may have started with a perfectlylegitimate end in view, and have been exploited by evil-doers for their ownpurposes, for, owing to the secretive nature of its proceedings, the fraternityform of organisation lends itself to various forms of law-breaking.One occult organisation is well known to have been involved in the drug traffic,another is riddled with unnatural vice. A third degenerated into what was littlebetter than a house of ill-fame, and its head was an expert abortionist. Othershave been involved in subversive politics. Those who join fraternities withoutproperly investigating them and the credentials of those who are running themmay find themselves involved in any or all of these things.Behind the veil of secrecy, guarded by impressive oaths, many things may happen,and it is therefore essential to inform oneself most carefully concerning thecharacter, credentials and record of the leaders of an organisation.If these are not readily accessible, something is wrong. The MysteriousStranger, who has just arrived from the East or the Continent, both rather vagueaddresses, is probably a fraud.If difficulty is experienced in discovering the antecedents of an alleged adept,enquiries could be made of the well-known periodical (However, Truth, formerlyof Carteret Street, S.W.I, stopped publishing many years ago.) Truth wasoriginally founded to expose abuses in financial and public life, and for thispurpose keeps a ‘Black List’ of individuals who are better avoided. It is fairand fearless in its methods, neither a persecutor nor a respecter of persons. Itkeeps a watchful eye upon the occult field and pillories charlatans, a task forwhich it should have the gratitude and support of all who have the cause of theWisdom Religion at heart.The commonest danger to which a person who gets into the company of undesirablesis exposed, is to be induced to part with more money than is convenient by thetime-honoured expedients of either swindling or blackmailing, the latter beingby far the commonest form of unpleasantness in Black Lodges. The one and onlyremedy in all such cases is to place the matter in the hands of the police.Firstly, it is your duty as a citizen in order that others may not be victimisedas you have been. Secondly, if you don't, your persecutors will not leave youuntil they have sucked you absolutely dry, and not even then if they can stillfind a use for you as a cat's-paw. A blackmailer is never got rid of by givinghim money. It is merely an invitation to call again. Act quickly and firmly atthe outset and you will soon be at the end of your troubles.To demand money with threats is blackmail, and to coerce to any course of actionby threats is also a crime. Any arrangements entered into, or documents signedin consequence of threats are not binding. Threats need not necessarily be grossand open, such as the pointing of a revolver; anything which coerces you againstyour inclinations may be interpreted as a threat. For instance, supposing itwere intimated to you, however tactfully, that if you did not subscribe to thefunds of an organisation, your interest in occultism would be gossiped about andpossibly involve you in unpleasantness with your relatives or your employers,this, in the eyes of the law would be blackmail. Anything, in fact, which playsupon a person's fears is a threat.Let us now consider what is the best thing to do if you are being threatened. Itis seldom wise to answer threat with threat. The best thing is to reply that youwill think it over and see what can be done, and then go straight to the nearestpolice-station and tell the whole story. You can be sure of the utmost courtesy,even kindness, and that every effort will be made to help you even if you haveto admit that you have not been wholly blameless yourself. In coming to thepolice and telling them frankly the position of affairs you have, in popularlanguage, “turned King's evidence,” and the authorities will go a long way toprotect anyone who does this.Do not be deterred by the fact that you cannot bring forward any additionaltestimony in support of your statement. The police may tell you that there isnot sufficient evidence for them to apply for a warrant; nevertheless, they willmake enquiries, and the very fact that the police are making enquiries will besufficient to frighten blackmailers out of their wits and probably out of thecountry, nor will they usually stop to make the threatened disclosures en route,but will “go while the going is good.” Moreover your complaint will go on to thepolice records, and a watch will be kept; in due course another complaint may bemade, or, for all you know, may already have been made, and then the net beginsto tighten.Always remember that the blackmailer has a great deal more to fear from exposurethan you have; for whatever unpleasantness may be in store for you, he has tolook forward to a long term of penal servitude, and possibly the dreaded “cat”if the case is a bad one.* A timely reminder of this fact works wonders withprospective blackmailers.Nor need the fear of exposure of your own shortcomings deter you. The nature ofthe charges brought against you by the blackmailer will never be mentioned. Itis not you who are being tried. Neither will your identity be disclosed. Youwill be referred to as Mr. A. or Mrs. B. Far from being treated as an evil-doeror having the finger of scorn pointed at you, you will find that you are lookedupon as a person who is performing a public service and every effort will bemade by those in authority to smooth your path. A determined effort is beingmade at the present time to stamp out this abominable crime, and judges aregiving exemplary sentences and protecting prosecutors in every way in order toencourage them to come forward.But quite apart from any form of coercion, unwary persons may, while filled withenthusiasm or glamoured by the new revelation, part with considerably more moneythan they can comfortably spare; they may even literally lay their all upon thealtar, and then, disillusioned by subsequent events, greatly regret having doneso. In many such cases a competent solicitor can secure a refund. The courts donot look with favour on excessive contributions to “movements.”It goes without saying, that no rightly conducted organisation would consent toaugment its funds at the expense of the ruin of one of its members. It must, ofcourse, equally protect itself against capriciousness and spite and themachinations of the kind of mentality that tries to buy influence bysubscriptions. It has always been our custom, in the Fraternity of the InnerLight, to insist that any woman who proposes to give a large donation shouldconsult her financial adviser before doing so. For one reason or another we haverefused upwards of twenty-five thousand pounds during the last seven years. Norhave we had any reason to regret having done so. The strength of an occultorganisation does not lie upon the physical plane.It is well known that there are various drugs which can be used to exaltconsciousness and induce a temporary psychism. It may not be equally well knownthat most of these substances come under the regulations of the Dangerous DrugsAct, and that to obtain them from irregular sources, or even to be found inpossession of them save for a legitimate purpose, is to render oneself liable toprosecution, and in this case too the authorities are exceedingly alert and themagistrates exceedingly drastic.All initiates of the Right-hand Path agree in declaring that to exaltconsciousness by means of drugs is a dangerous and undesirable proceeding. Theremay be research workers who for legitimate reasons wish to undertakeexperiments, but I cannot conceive of any legitimate reason for introducing aneophyte to the drug habit. In any case, if such experiments are undertaken,they should be conducted under the supervision of a qualified medicalpractitioner who will be in a position to prevent catastrophe or deal with itshould it arise. The drugs that alter consciousness also affect the heart, andhearts are not always all they should be. Moreover, the composition of raredrugs is not standardised and varies enormously; they are liable to containvarious impurities, and samples may turn out to be unusually toxic. Theunpleasantness of having upon one's hands an unexpected and unaccountable corpseis only exceeded by the unpleasantness of becoming the corpse oneself, either ofwhich eventualities may happen when people begin to experiment with the drugsthat “unloose the girders of the mind.”The morals of mankind in general leave much to be desired from the point of viewof the purist, and the occult organisations, occupying as they do, the sea-coastof Bohemia, leave more than usual. A few of the best, maintaining that occultismis essentially a religion, uphold a high standard; the remainder are blest witha kaleidoscopic collection of soul-mates. This need not concern us here. Ifpeople choose to kick over Mrs. Grundy's apron-strings, that is their affair.Nor need we at the moment consider the occult abuses of sex-force, which willrequire detailed consideration in their proper place. All we need consider inthis chapter is the purely normal form of loose living which is camouflagedunder a pretence of occultism. Of this I have seen numerous cases. The head ofone group systematically seduced his pupils under the pretext that it was partof their initiation, and the group accepted the situation in a spirit of thepurest self-sacrifice. Several others sailed unpleasantly near the wind, withthe result that “crushes” and the subsequent nervous breakdowns were veryprevalent. It ought hardly to be necessary to say that such methods form no partof the Right-hand Path.It is amazing to what an extent women of the highest ideals and of good familyand wide culture can be induced to accept such theories and practices. Thedanger of membership of such a group to young girls or unsophisticated women canreadily be imagined.I have often been accused of being narrow-minded in my attitude towards groupsin which such happenings are allowed to go on, but the cost in human sufferingis so great and the general demoralisation so sordid that tolerance comesperilously near to cynicism.It may not generally be realised, but there is just as much danger of corruptionin a Black Lodge for boys and youths as there is for women. There have been anumber of cases so flagrant that the police have intervened, both here andabroad.In ancient times, and among primitive peoples, human sacrifice was a commonincident in connection with occult practices. It is not unknown in EasternEurope even at the present day. The nursery story of Bluebeard has its origin inthe practices of the infamous Gilles de Rais, Marshal of France and comrade ofJoan of Arc, who slaughtered innumerable children and youths in connection withhis magical experiments. I have never heard of a case in England, but there havebeen at various times some curious killings reported from the United Stateswhich look suspiciously like ritual murders, but in the absence of adequateinformation it is impossible to come to a final conclusion upon them. Thererecently came into my hands, however, a book upon magic published for privatecirculation, in which the statement is made that the ideal blood sacrifice is amale child.The charge of revolutionary activities is one that has been frequently madeagainst the occult movement. There are certain things, however, which must beborne in mind when assessing the truth of this charge. Firstly, the occultmovement is not a homogeneous whole. It is totally unorganised and unregulated,and may best be likened to the state of England before the Norman Conquest.Conditions in the various groups and associations vary widely, and what is trueof one may not be true of another. There can be no doubt whatsoever that variousorganisations at various times have been implicated in politics, as witness theTheosophical Society's association with Indian political movements; but we mustbear in mind that one generation's revolutionaries are the next generation'sreactionaries. After all, politics are a matter of opinion, and even the peoplewe disagree with may turn out to be right in the end. I, personally, am of theopinion that an occult fraternity is extremely ill-advised to concern itselfwith politics for reasons which I have stated in another of my books, SaneOccultism, and which I will not enter upon now, as they are not relevant tothese pages. But as folk from time immemorial have banded themselves togetherfor political action we cannot very well take exception to what the law permits.People who join an organisation established for political work join it withtheir eyes open and presumably for the purposes for which it was founded.Grounds for objection arise, however, when an organisation is founded fornon-political pursuits and subsequently the leaders, without consulting, or eveninforming their supporters, take up political activities on their own accountand use their organisation for the purpose, thus involving their followerswithout their consent in whatever complications may arise, and using moneycontributed for a specific purpose for ends other than the donors had in view.It may be wondered what use, at the present day, revolutionaries could make ofthe occult organisations. Within my personal knowledge they have used, orattempted to use them, for the purpose of getting letters to people whosecorrespondence is being watched, and I myself once received a request to allow aperson who had been deported to return to the country under an assumed name andreside in one of our community houses as a member, and was offered some hundredsof pounds for so doing.Needless to say, the correspondence was sent straight to the authorities.The problems which we have considered in this chapter are not peculiar to occultfraternities, but are common to any organisation which does not discriminate asto its members. The organisations which advertise must perforce take all comersand sort them out in the light of subsequent experience, and some of theseexperiences can be very queer indeed. One cannot blame an organisation thatpicks up an occasional black sheep, one only takes exception if it retains anaccumulation of them.A lodge of dubious whiteness can be readily recognised by the type of people whobelong to it, who may best be described as the seedy adventurer type with asprinkling of smart society folk, who often have a taste for crude flavours inthe way of sensation. The really Black Lodges are as carefully guarded as thehigh-grade White Lodges, and no outsider can gain entrance to them. The seriousstudent of Black Occultism is out for knowledge and magical experiment and he isnot going to waste his time on a tyro. Those who choose to graduate into a BlackLodge after serving their apprenticeship in the Outer Court of a White Lodge doso with their eyes open, and experience must be their teacher. One cannot feelthat they deserve much sympathy if the experience is a painful one. The person Iam out to help is the person who is a victim, not the one who is hoist with hisown petard. The man or woman who, rejecting the steady grade of the Way ofInitiation, chooses to go up with a rocket had better come down with the stick.Any request for a large sum of money should always be regarded as a dangersignal. It is one of the strictest conditions of initiation that occultknowledge may never be sold or used for gain. I know of an occultist who charges£300 for one of the initiations he confers; and he will give it to anyone whohas got £300. In my opinion, the person who pays out £300 for such a purposedeserves the kind of initiation he is going to get.It is also a bad sign when an occultist makes free with signs and wonders beforethe uninitiated. No genuine adept ever does this. The person who reads your pastincarnations, describes your aura, rolls up his eyes, twitches, and gives you amessage from your Master as soon as he is introduced, is a person to be avoided.The more I see of the occult movement, the more I am amazed at the things peoplecan say and do and “get away with.” The average person is out of his depth whenhe deals with psychic matters. He usually goes through three phases. Firstly, hethinks it is all superstition and fraud. Secondly, his scepticism beingbreached, he will believe anything. Thirdly, if he ever gets as far as thirdly,he learns discrimination, and distinguishes between the Black Fraternities, theWhite Fraternities and Fatuous Fraternities."},{"pageContent":"> 11 THE PSYCHIC ELEMENT IN MENTAL DISTURBANCE > Personality, individuality and reincarnation Image [images/00004.jpg] The> three great instincts Image [images/00004.jpg] Hysteria Image> [images/00004.jpg] The neurotic Image [images/00004.jpg] Organic insanities> Image [images/00004.jpg] The endocrines Image [images/00004.jpg] The blood> Image [images/00004.jpg] Contacting the Unseen Image [images/00004.jpg]> Qabalistic concept of the Invisible Kingdoms Image [images/00004.jpg] The> Qlippoth in relation to insanity Image [images/00004.jpg] Consciousness in> relation to the Spheres Image [images/00004.jpg] The Psychism of the> psychopath Image [images/00004.jpg] Common ground of psychology and occultism> Image [images/00004.jpg] Occult methods of dealing with insanity Image> [images/00004.jpg] Obsession. WE HAVE SEEN in a previous chapter that nervous and mental disorders canstimulate a psychic attack, especially if the subject is familiar with theterminology of occultism. We must also consider the part played by psychicattack in nervous and mental disorders. But before we can embark upon thissection of our studies, we must give a brief explanation of the nature ofnervous and mental disturbances and the distinction between them. We will not gointo academic considerations, for these pages are not written for the orthodoxprofessional psychologist, who has an abundance of textbooks at his disposal,but for the person whose interest is primarily in occult matters, and who comesto the study of the subject unequipped with the technicalities of psychology andpsycho-physiology, two sciences of which at least a working knowledge isexceedingly necessary in the pursuit of practical occultism.In the course of an incarnation the mind is built up on the foundations of thetraits of the Higher Self or Individuality, which is the immortal soul thatdevelops in the course of an evolution. The mind, therefore, is part of thepersonality - the unit of incarnation - commencing at birth and dissolving atdeath, its essence being absorbed by the individuality, which evolves thereby.The mind is essentially the organ of adaptation to the environment, and it iswhen that adaptation fails that neurotic and hysterical troubles begin. Eachliving creature is the channel for a current of life-force which proceeds fromthe Logos, the Creator of this universe. This current is divided into three mainchannels represented to us as the three great natural instincts,Self-preservation, Reproduction, and the Social Instinct. These are themainsprings of our lives. The pressure of life itself is behind them, and ifthey are thwarted beyond their power of compensation (considerable as that is)they are like streams whose channels are blocked, and which in consequenceoverflow and make a morass of the adjacent land.Emotion is the subjective aspect of an instinct. That is to say, when aninstinct is at work, we feel emotion. Every emotion we feel can be referred toone or other of the instincts. Our resentment of a slur upon our dignity has itsroots in the instinct of Self-preservation. Our love of art has its roots in theinstinct of love, beauty and creative expression which, upon its lowest arc, iscalled sex. Each of these instincts has its high spiritual aspect and itselemental physical aspect, and transmutation from one plane to another takesplace freely, so that unless we understand the significance of thesemanifestations we shall be misled. In their understanding is the key to thescience of life.If one of these great instincts is so thwarted that all attempts at compensationbreak down; or if the temperament is so inelastic and unaccommodating that itwill not modify its demands, the ego makes a final desperate attempt atadjustment which goes outside the limits within which harmonious relations withthe environment can be maintained. Communications with the environment breakdown, and the mind has, in part at least, quitted the sphere of reality for thesphere of imagination. The sense of fixed values is lost, and things assume asymbolic importance. This breakdown may be partial, relating to certain aspectsof the life only, or it may be total.In hysteria, the damned-up forces of life remain in the channel, but spurt withconcentrated force through any sluice that may be opened to them. Consequently,instead of the river below the obstruction being a smooth-flowing body of water,it descends in rapids and whirlpools difficult and dangerous to navigate, sothat the barque of life makes shipwreck therein. The surrounding country, too,is reduced to a morass, neither land nor water. In other words, the temperamentbecomes tempestuous and unduly emotional, and the non-emotional factors of themind, such as judgment and self-control, are demoralised. Such a temperamentmust of necessity be perpetually in difficulties with life, and periodically therepressed emotions boil over in fits of screaming, crying and convulsivemuscular movements, which act as safety valves and relieve the pressuretemporarily.The neurotic differs from the hysteric in certain well-marked ways which need tobe carefully borne in mind, as they are very important from the practicalstandpoint. The troubles of the neurotic start in the same way as those of thehysteric, being due to repressed emotion and failure to adapt to environment;but in his case, the life-forces set to work to cut fresh channels forthemselves that shall circumvent the obstacle which blocks their path.Consequently we get what the psychologist calls displacement of emotion. Somecomparatively innocuous matter becomes the object of an outpouring of emotionwhich in no way concerns it, for it has been made a substitute for somethingelse. It is this curious underground tracking of emotion in the mind whichcauses so much trouble, for the sufferer is not insane, and yet certain sectionsof his values and reactions to life are perverted. He is an extremely trickyperson to deal with because he is given to unexpected and quite irrational lovesand hates and fears, and acts accordingly.Similar conditions prevail in the organic insanities; the psychological resultsare the same, but because the origin is physical, not mental, they are butlittle amenable to psychotherapy. Certain things can be done to alleviate them,however, even if they are not entirely curable; therefore let us consider themfrom both the psycho-physical and occult standpoints.The body is the vehicle of the mind. If the vehicle be faulty, the mind cannotexpress itself accurately; its reactions will be distorted. Orthodox sciencesays that the brain is the organ of the mind, but esoteric science says thebrain is the organ of perception of sense impressions and coordination ofefferent impulses. It is the telephone exchange of the nervous system. It isonly one of the points where mind touches body, the others being the ductlessglands of the endocrine system, the pineal, pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, thymusand gonads; to which may be added the Solar Plexus and Sacral Plexus. Thestudent of Tantric physiology will be very dull if he has not observed that theChakras coincide in their physical location with the endocrine organs.Now the endocrines have for their task the maintenance of the chemicalcomposition of the blood. They pour into it their secretions, called hormones,in certain balanced proportions. If the balance is in any way upset, either byan overplus of one secretion or shortage of another, profound changes inmetabolism take place. The whole of the life processes are regulated by theendocrines, and can be speeded up or slowed down in their different aspects asthe balance of the endocrines alters. This endocrine balance is known byphysiologists to be intimately associated with emotional states, and especiallywith the alertness or stolidity of the temperament. Psychologists do notsufficiently appreciate the importance of the recent work upon the endocrines,but occultists have a knowledge of this aspect of psycho-physiology as part oftheir traditional teaching. The breathing exercises of the yoga system are basedupon this knowledge, and are exceedingly potent, as are all occult practiceswhich are brought through correctly to the physical plane. In fact, we may saythat no occult process is really potent, nor can it be said to have completedits circuit, unless it has its point of contact with dense matter; a point whichmany occultists leave out of their calculations. Occultism, though primarily amental process, is not a purely mental process. It is both spiritual andmaterial.In the great majority of cases of insanity, organic brain changes cannot bedemonstrated, but alienists are more and more coming to recognise that they maylook for the clues of Hecate in the blood. Its chemical composition may departfrom normal, whether owing to a change in the hormone balance or to theby-products of disease. This change in the blood chemistry is immediatelyfollowed by a change in the emotional tone. It may become over-emotional ordepressed, apathetic or irritable. The ancients described these conditionsadmirably as the four humours, the sanguine, the bilious, the lymphatic and thecholeric.It has been abundantly demonstrated by physiologists that emotional statesaffect the chemical composition of the blood. It is gradually being realisedthat these changes are brought about through the mediation of the ductlessglands, which may be called the emotional brain, just as the grey matter withinthe skull may be called the sensory-motor brain. It follows, therefore, that ifthrough some interference with their functioning the glands produce ablood-composition corresponding to that produced by them when a particularemotional state is giving its special stimulus, the individual will experiencethe physical sensations associated with the corresponding emotional state. Hismind will proceed to adjust itself to these conditions by accounting for themthrough the imagination as best it may. So that if there is a state of the bloodcharacteristic of the condition of fear, fear-images will arise in the mind. Itis upon this basis that the organic insanities produce their characteristicmental states.Whether the emotional state be due to a mental cause or a physical cause, theresult is the same for the patient. Organic insanities are distinguished fromfunctional ones solely by their origin. An organic insanity tends to departfurther from the normal than a functional nervous disorder, because in thelatter a considerable degree of compensation takes place, for the patient can toa great extent pull himself together and keep himself from going to disastrousextremes. This is not the case with an organic insanity, which proceeds to itslogical conclusion. It is for this reason that a neurotic, although he maysuffer severely, seldom has a complete breakdown unless he is sure of thenecessities of life. The self-preservation instinct keeps him on his feet.Having considered the physical and subjective bases of mental disturbances, weare now in a position to assess accurately the part played by the Unseen. Whathappens when a neurotic takes up occultism? We can best answer this question byconsidering what happens when a normal person takes up occultism. He learns forthe first time of the existence of the Invisible Worlds and begins to thinkabout them. Immediately he does this he comes into touch with them. At first hemay not be able to perceive them consciously; nevertheless he is feeling themsubconsciously and they are affecting him. His life shows this to the closeobserver in a thousand ways.There are great forces moving like currents in the Unseen, and we are drawn intothese according to our temperamental affinity for them. The violent personalityis drawn into the Current of Mars, the emotional, suggestible one into thesphere of Luna. The influences of these spheres play upon them. Now theoccultist working under a proper system, knowing that he has got to meet theseforces sooner or later, picks them up one by one voluntarily and by means of theappropriate rituals, and synthesises them within his own nature. He knows toothat each aspect has its obverse. The Virgin Mary is reflected in Lilith. Theolder faiths knew this, but popular Christianity, which has no roots intradition, has forgotten it. Protestant Christianity threw away its occultaspect at the Reformation. All the pagan pantheons have gross aspects ofdivinities as well as etherial ones. We need to search the refuse-heap ofhistory for the lost parts of our own tradition if our faith is to be complete,and the most profitable line of search is in the Qabalah and the Gnosticliterature. The literature of the Gnosis has been largely destroyed bysystematic persecution, but in the Qabalah there is still left for us a completesystem. The Jews, being strictly monotheistic, did not speak of gods, but theyrecognised a hierarchy of angels and archangels which is the equivalent of thepagan pantheons. It is through these ethereal messengers that the All-Fatherformed the worlds.Let us consider once more the Qabalistic doctrine of the Qlippoth, for it has anintimate bearing upon the problem of insanity. The doctrine of the Ten HolySephiroth, arranged in their correct pattern to form the Tree of Life, isinvaluable in enabling us to conceive the Invisible. The First Sephira isconcentrated out of the Unmanifest, the Point within the Circle. This emanatesthe Second, which in its turn emanates the Third. As soon as one has emanatedanother, these two are said to be equilibrated; but when emanation is inprocess, there is a period of unbalanced force. This, as it were, goes off byitself in the Cosmos and establishes a sphere of its own, unconnected with theCosmic system. Consequently, each sphere of the Cosmos has its counterpart inChaos, in miniature, it is true, but nevertheless potent and functional.Each sphere, in the course of its evolution, builds up an Over -soul which iscalled by different names in different systems. In the Qabalistic system we callthem the Archangels, the Spirits before the Throne. The Sphere of the Sun isrepresented by Raphael, the Sphere of the Moon by Gabriel. The ObverseSephiroth, or Qlippoth, build up in exactly the same way. In the Habitations ofHell these two are known as the Disputers and the Obscene Ones, whose namessufficiently indicate their characters. The Sphere of the Sun is also the pointof manifestation of the Messiah or Saviour upon earth. The Prince of Peace hasHis obverse in the Disputers. Who that has had the Vision Beautiful does notknow the reaction that follows it, and the need of wisdom, self-control andpatience to deal with the forces that are released not only in the soul but inthe environment? It is for this reason that periods of purgation and disciplineprecede all revelations. We must keep the vigil before we can sit at the feast.Consciousness, released from the Sphere of Earth, rises straight upwards to theSphere of the Moon. This is the negative, feminine, receptive, psychic sphere.From thence it passes onwards to the Sphere of the Sun. This is the positive,masculine sphere of the higher consciousness, the vision of the seer asdistinguished from the psychic. Upon either hand the path is flanked by theSpheres of Hermetic Wisdom and Elemental Beauty.These Spheres, which have to do with the grades of initiation, need not concernus in the present pages. We shall only have to do with the Sphere of the Moon,Luna, the Mistress of the Luna-tic. Now Luna was represented by the ancientsunder diverse forms as Diana the chaste huntress, symbol of sublimation, andHecate, patroness of witchcraft and childbirth. We have already noted that theQlippoth of the Sphere of Luna are called the Obscene Ones. Hence it is thatwhen the unstable soul advances by the Path of Saturn that bridges the Astraland enters the Sphere of Luna, he touches her Hecate aspect and finds himself enrapport with the Obscene Ones, whose chief is Lilith, she who giveth lustfuldreams. Need we then wonder that Freud finds the dreams of the neurotic filledwith sexual images in their most perverted and debased forms? The Rabbis knewtheir psychology just as well as he does.As has already been noted, the neurotic is very often psychic, and the psychicis very often neurotic. What may we expect to happen to the soul that has takeninitiation in a past life, retains subconsciously the psychic development thusconferred, and finds itself incarnated in a neurotic personality in this life?He will come under the dark dominion of the Moon, and Lilith will be hismistress. Through the ill-fitting doors of the neurotic temperament the forcesof the Abyss find ingress. The dissociated complexes of the Microcosm arereinforced by the dissociated complexes of the Macrocosm, for that is preciselywhat the Qlippoth are.Occultists and their ignorant admirers, the superstitious, have always held thatinsanity had to do with demonic possession. Modern medicine disputes this, anddeclares the various manifestations of the diseased mind to be due entirely tosubjective psychological processes. At present these two schools of thought arelike two armed camps, drawn up for battle and shaking their weapons at eachother. Each is too sure of his own ground to be willing to give the other ahearing. It is my belief that a common ground can be found for the meeting ofthese two opposing viewpoints. Psychology demonstrates the mechanism of the mindand can explain the mental processes whereby the ideas of the deranged assumetheir ultimate form. It can show the connection between these ideas and thedreams of the normal mentality. What it cannot explain is the fundamentaldifference between these subjective states and the normal waking consciousness.It is here that the occultist can tell the psychologist something that it isworth his while to hear, for he can show how these visions can be producedexperimentally and at will by means of ceremonial magic. And still moreimportant, the occultist can show him how these visions can be dispersed and thepsychic faculties closed down and sealed.This brings us to the practical part of our considerations: How far can themethods of ritual magic be applied to the relief of mental disease? They areundoubtedly palliative, but they will not produce a permanent cure unless theorigin of the disturbed mental condition is found and cleared up. Unless this bedone, as fast as we disperse the phantoms, they will re-form, because the mentalstate of the patient is invoking them. Under such circumstances, no magic circlecan be kept intact. As fast as we break the rapport with the Abyss, the patientrenews it.But such conditions constitute a vicious circle. The Qlippotic forces with whicha contact has been established will actively develop it, and will hold on totheir victim when attempts are made to dislodge them. In this rationalistic agewe are apt to forget that there is such a thing as organised and intelligentevil. If the physical causes of this disturbance have been cleared up, theseptic focus eradicated, or the tumour pressing upon the ductless gland excised,and still the mentality does not return to normal, an exorcism will oftenproduce immediate and marked results.In the case of the neurotic, whose trouble is entirely in the sphere of themind, an exorcism is of enormous value as a preliminary to the appropriatepsycho-therapeutic treatment because it clears the ground and preventsre-infection, giving the patient a chance to make a fresh start. It is possiblefor the Qlippotic demons to gain so powerful a hypnotic influence over a victimthat he is powerless to break it by any effort of his own will, not can theorthodox type of psychotherapy touch the root of the trouble. The exorcism mayhave to be repeated two or three times in the course of the treatment, becausethe rapports may be renewed after they have been broken. But once the patient'scomplexes have been cleared up, they will not return. In any case, an exorcismproduces marked Temporary benefit; during the lull the patient gets a chance topull himself together and the evil influences are undermined. A courageouspatient, who is cooperating intelligently, will seldom have to be exorcised morethan three times provided material conditions are favourable. I have seen casescleared by a single exorcism, and remaining well indefinitely so long as thepatient obeyed instructions and had nothing whatever to do with the Unseen,neither reading books upon occultism nor associating with people who wereinterested in such subjects; and I have also seen the Abyss re-establish itsinfluence when the patient disobeyed instructions and re-awakened the oldvibrations.We need to realise that the human consciousness is not a closed vessel, but likethe body, has a continual intake and output. The cosmic forces are circulatingthrough it all the time, like sea-water through a living sponge. Whateveremotional state may arise within us is reinforced from outside. The subjectiveself only has the kindling, the Cosmos supplies the fuel. Once the fire isstarted, the cosmic forces of the appropriate type will stoke it. Just as thedevout Catholic is inspired by the influences of his patron saint, invoked byprayer, so the neurotic is hag-ridden by his obsessive demon, invoked by themorbid broodings of the dissociated subconsciousness. The occultist maintainsthat the generalised principle of evil has its intelligent channels, just as theorganised Principle of Good has Its ministering spirits. Any observer whoconsiders the phenomena of mental disturbance will find much to support thishypothesis.The question of obsession is an exceedingly important one. The word is used veryfreely in occult circles, and is held to mean the withdrawal of a soul from itsbody and its replacement by another soul, but I doubt whether this is a truerepresentation of what happens. It has always appeared to me that in obsessionwe have not got the actual replacement of one soul by another, but the completedomination of one soul by another. It is hypnotic domination, and we can explainit in terms of the known psychology of hypnosis, the hypnotist in the case beingan astral entity.There is an operation in magic known as “assuming the god-form,” in which theoperator identifies himself in imagination with the god and so becomes a channelfor its power. It is one of the special modes of Egyptian magic wherein thepriest always wore a mask to represent the animal head symbolically attributedto the god he represented. This imaginative identification is a method wellknown in occultism and is often employed in order to enter into the inner lifeof a plant or a crystal as a mental exercise. The effects of it are very markedand very peculiar. I am inclined to think that it is this method, combined withhypnosis, which is used by the obsessing entity, which first identifies itselfwith its victim and then superimposes its own personality upon his, thusobtaining a vehicle of manifestation. I am also of the opinion, however, that itis only in certain abnormal states, whether induced by disease of mind or body,or by some of the more drastic operations of black magic, that this impositioncan take place."},{"pageContent":"> PART III> THE DIAGNOSIS OF A PSYCHIC ATTACK "},{"pageContent":"> 12 METHODS EMPLOYED IN MAKING A PSYCHIC ATTACK > Witchcraft, ancient and modern Image [images/00004.jpg] Knowledge of drugs> Image [images/00004.jpg] Factors concerned in making a Psychic attack Image> [images/00004.jpg] Mental concentration Image [images/00004.jpg] Invocation of> a Cosmic force Image [images/00004.jpg] Example of a ceremonial invocation> Image [images/00004.jpg] The magician himself the channel of evocation Image> [images/00004.jpg] Method of contacting the victim Image [images/00004.jpg]> Substitution Image [images/00004.jpg] Talismans Image [images/00004.jpg]> Magnetised objects Image [images/00004.jpg] Motives for psychic attack Image> [images/00004.jpg] Case of the concert singer Image [images/00004.jpg] Case of> the Oriental Adept Image [images/00004.jpg] Mental trespassing. ANYONE WHO READS the old books on witchcraft, usually compiled by theprofessional witch-finders from the confessions of alleged witches extortedunder torture, will find that the phenomena described fall into certain broadcategories which are so constant in different ages and in different parts of theworld that we are left with the impression that there must be some fire behindso much smoke. The State records of witch trials in Scotland, the reports of apriest charged with the task of extirpating witchcraft in Northern Italy, thearchives of Brittany, the stories of magic in classical literature, and finally,travellers' accounts of the practices of primitive people all over the world,all corroborate each other, agreeing as to the phenomena described, theexplanations given by the witches of their methods, and the broad divisions intowhich the phenomena fall.We must first take account of the use of drugs, of which the Black Fraternity inall ages have possessed a remarkable knowledge. Potions, unguents andfumigations were used extensively and among all the weird and wonderfulingredients of which they were composed we now and again find substances whichare known to be medicinally potent.The poppy which gives sleep and dreams, hemp which gives visions, datura whichproduces loss of memory, blighted grains which produce abortion, certain insectswhich are powerfully aphrodisiac, certain barks which are effectuallyanaphrodasiac, and in the New World, the buds of a certain cactus - all theseand many others play their part in the witch brews. Paracelsus earned fame byturning some of the traditional magical brews to medicinal purposes. The Borgiasearned infamy by employing them as subtle poisons which destroyed the mindwithout necessarily destroying the body. It is related that the Romanphilosopher Lucretius was driven insane by a magical draught given him by hiswife in order to restore to her his lost affections. There exist old recipes forwitch unguents which contain opium and cantharides. It is not difficult toimagine what manner of dreams would come in the sleep thus induced. C. S.Ollivier, in his recent book, Analysis of Magic and Witchcraft, gives it as hisopinion that attendance at the Sabbat was often achieved by means ofdrug-induced dreams.Subtle poisons also undoubtedly play a part in the effectiveness of curses, afavourite method being to make a talisman of brass, copper or lead, and fastenit inconspicuously at the bottom of a drinking vessel or cooking pot. Whateffect the talisman had is conjectural, but there is no doubt at all about theeffect of the steady dissolving of small quantities of lead and verdigris in thefood.But while all these things were a part, and a considerable part, of thewitch-cult, they cannot, strictly speaking, be considered a psychic method ofattack, and we only refer to them in these pages in order that their effects maybe excluded from the diagnosis.There are three factors in a psychic attack, any or all of which may be employedin a given instance. The first of these is telepathic hypnotic suggestion. Thesecond is the reinforcement of the suggestion by the invocation of certaininvisible agencies. The third is the employment of some physical substance as apoint d'appui, point of contact, or magnetic link. The force employed may beused as direct current, transmitted by the mental concentration of the operator,or it may be reserved in a kind of psychic storage battery, which may be eitheran artificial elemental or a talisman.In chapter 11 [index_split_022.html#filepos334246] we have considered in somedetail the psychology of suggestion, and need not repeat what has already beensaid, save to remind the reader that the essence of telepathy consists in thesympathetic induction of vibration. Experimental psychologists are alreadysuspecting that emotion is closely akin to electricity; they have provedconclusively that emotional states alter the electrical conductivity of thebody. The occultist believes that emotion is a force of an electrical type, andthat in the case of the ordinary man it radiates out from him in all directions,forming a magnetic field; but in the case of the trained occultist it can beconcentrated into a beam and directed. Supposing you ate able to concentrateyour whole attention upon a single feeling, inhibiting all else, you will haveachieved a pure emotional state, unadulterated and undiluted. All the life-forcecoming into your soul will therefore flow in this single subdivision of a singlechannel instead of in the many ramifications of the usual three channelspreviously referred to. The concentration will be terrific, but it will only beachieved at a terrific price. It is in order to achieve this terribleconcentration that the saints of the West and the yogis of the East practise atorturing asceticism. You must sell all that you possess in order to purchasethis pearl of great price, and an echo of the method lingers in the fairy-taletradition that the person who finds the lucky stone can only have one wish. Sucha concentration is good for one purpose, and one purpose only. We canconcentrate on a healing, or on a destruction, but we cannot work at bothsimultaneously; neither can we readily change over from one to the other. Wecannot combine incompatibles within the limits of a single life. That is to say,if we have concentrated on a work of malediction and death in order to achievean act of revenge, our rage being satiated, we cannot immediately reverse thespin of the soul and reconcéntrate upon works of wisdom and redemption. We mayliken the soul moving with the tide of evolution to a wheel spinning clockwise,or deosil; and a soul moving against the tide of evolution to a wheel spinningcounter-clockwise, or widdershins. The position of the axle can be altered sothat the wheel revolves at any angle without the direction of its revolutionbeing effected, but the flywheel has to be stopped before the engine can bereversed, and a big flywheel takes a great deal of stopping. Moreover, in orderto reverse the flywheel, we have to stop the engine. The normal movement of thesoul is deosil, forward with the current of evolution. We need to think manytimes before we undertake to reverse that spin even momentarily, in order toundertake a work of malediction and death. The old saying, “There is the devilto pay,” is a true one. Indeed, it is questionable whether there is such a thingas momentary reversal of spin. Momentum has to be checked and worked up againbefore reversal of spin can take place.Very great forces can be developed by this subjective concentration of the minditself, but even greater forces can be rendered available if we apply themechanical equivalent of gearing; if, in other words, while this tremendousconcentration is being held, we pick up the contacts of the corresponding cosmicforce. We use the powers of the human mind as a self-starter, and as soon as itslesser driving-wheel is flying round merrily, we throw in the clutch of the mainengine. There is a brief period of struggle as the little machine forces overthe reluctant levers of the great machine, then the vapour fires and then theengine takes up its work. After that it is only a matter of engaging the gearsand driving - if you can! So it is with ceremonial magic.Let us consider a concrete case of someone who wants to avail himself of afighting force. He would have recourse to a ceremony of the planet Mars. Hewould therefore gather together in his temple all that was appropriate to Mars.He would drape his altar with a scarlet cloth; he would himself wear a scarletrobe. All his magical implements would be of iron and his rod of power would bea naked sword. Upon his altar he would place five lights, five being the numberof Mars. Upon his breast would be the symbol of Mars engraved upon a steelpentagon. On his hand would be a ruby ring. He would burn sulphur and saltpetrein his thurible. Then, according to the work in hand, he would call upon theangelic or demonic aspect of the Fifth Sephira, Geburah, the sphere of Mars. Hewould invoke either the deity-name in Geburah, calling upon the God of Battlesto hear him, or the arch-devil of the Fifth Infernal Habitation. Havingperformed this mighty invocation, he would then offer himself upon the altar asthe channel for the manifestation of the force.There are many formulae extant designed to enable a force to be brought throughwithout the necessity of the magician himself being the channel. In my opinionthey are one and all ineffectual; the only possible substitute for the magicianhimself being a trance medium. It is for this reason that ritual magic so oftenfails to come off. You cannot make custards without breaking eggs, and if youmean to be a magician you have got to “go the whole hog.” When it is a questionof bringing through the angelic aspect of a force, the matter is on a clearfooting. To be the channel of such a force is a great privilege and is aninitiation in itself. The operator has simply to eliminate from his nature allincompatibles and maintain his concentration without wavering. The worst thatcan happen is that he should fail to obtain his results. But when it comes tobringing through the demonic aspect of a sphere, the matter is on an entirelydifferent footing. Very few people care to offer themselves for themanifestation of such a force as Asmodeus. I do not believe that there is anyreliable device for invoking the devils without being obsessed by them save themethod of Abramelin, which involves six months' preparation and is only operatedafter the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel have beenattained. The edge of the Abyss is well fenced. It is not possible to fire a gunand avoid the recoil.Having invoked and concentrated his force, our sorcerer has next to consider histarget. He has to get into astral contact with his victim. In order to do this,he must form a rapport, not quite as easy as might be imagined. First he has tofind his victim and establish a point of contact in his sphere, and then,working from this base, succeed in piercing his aura. An unfocussed force is notvery much use. A focus has to be achieved. The usual method is to obtain someobject which is impregnated with the intended victim's magnetism, a lock ofhair, nail-paring, or something habitually worn or handled. Such an object ismagnetically connected with its owner, and the sorcerer can work up the trailand thus enter the sphere of his victim and establish a rapport. He thenproceeds as does any other practitioner of suggestion who has succeeded ingetting his victim into the first stages of hypnosis. By means of the magneticlink he has gained the psychic ear of his victim, who will hear his suggestionssubconsciously. It now remains to be seen whether the thought-seeds thus plantedwill strike root or be cast out from the mind. In any case the victim isrendered disturbed and uneasy.If a magnetic link cannot be obtained, the practitioner of black magic has tofall back upon other devices. One of the most common is that of Substitution.Something is chosen and by means of ceremonial is identified with the intendedvictim. For instance, a small animal may be baptised with the victim's name, andthen immolated, usually with torture, the operator meanwhile concentrating uponthe personality of the original. The old device of making a wax image andmelting it before a fire, or driving nails into a wooden statue, baptised withthe name of the victim, are frequently met with in the records of witch-trials.The actual driving of the nail has no conceivable effect upon the victim, but ithelps the concentration of the operator.The talismanic method in various forms is also employed. A talisman is a symbolrepresenting a certain force, or combination of forces, depicted upon a suitablesubstance and magnetised by ritual. It can be made from anything which willretain magnetism; metals, precious stones or parchment are usually employed;paper is less effective unless it be enclosed in a metal case. Water and oil canbe effectually magnerised but soon lose their potency. A talisman is made byinvoking the requisite force, as already described, and then concentrating itupon the prepared object, which is placed ready upon the altar before theevocation begins.A talisman thus made has next to be brought into the magnetic sphere of thevictim. It is related that Lady Burton, anxious to convert her free-thinkinghusband, the famous Sir Richard Burton, the great explorer, used to get herpriest to bless little statues of the saints and put them in the pockets of hisclothes. A similar device is used by the workers of black occultism. Magnetisedobjects are placed in the rooms habitually occupied by the victim, or buried inhis path, so that he must pass over them frequently.These talismans of evil not only work by their own power, but also serve thesorcerer as a point of concentration for his meditations. Harmful effects arealso produced by objects which have been used in black magic and have becomeimpregnated with the forces they were employed in generating. Odds and ends ofmagical equipment turn up in some queer places. I was present at an auction in acountry town when the twelve signs of the Zodiac, neatly painted on ablackboard, came up for sale. Various of my friends have picked up magicaltreasures, such as altar lamps and incense burners that obviously came out ofritual lodges, but the prize of the collection was a magical rod that was put upto auction along with a bundle of fire-irons. Large crystals for scrying arefrequently seen in antique shops. All such things need carefully de-magnetisingbefore they are brought into one's psychic sphere.I was taking part at one time in a series of psychic experiments which had beengoing on very well, when, for no apparent reason, things went wrong and therewas a considerable upheaval. We did not know at the time, but we learnt later,that the owner of the flat where they were being held had obtained possession ofa floor-cloth that had been used in ritual magic by an occultist whom only theutmost leniency could call doubtful.The artificial elemental is really the basis of the efficacy of curses. In thiscase no physical substance is employed, but a portion of the Akasha is mouldedinto a definite form and held thus by the will of the operator until, as itwere, it “sets.” Into this mould is poured the concentrated energy of theoperator, something of his own self goes into it. This is its soul, and it islike a self-steering torpedo which is set to move in a curve towards a chosenmark. Or the operator, if an expert magician, may deliberately ensoul thisthought-form with elemental essence, which is the raw, undifferentiatedsubstance of life drawn from one or another of the elemental kingdoms. It is inorder to do this that the curse is invoked in the name of some being. The curserdeclares, “I curse you by so and so.” This is the form of evocation which callsthe ensouling essence into the thought-form, thus making an artificial elementalwhich is endowed with an independent life of its own.If we want to know something of the efficacy of curses, we have only to considerthe record of the men who were connected with the opening of the famousTut-ankh-amen tomb. There are many other cases equally well authenticated.One can become exposed to occult unpleasantness eithet by thwarting or in someother way falling foul of an unscrupulous occultist, or by getting oneselfinvolved with a dubious occult fraternity. In the case of a quarrel with anoccultist, in addition to the ordinary human motives for an abuse of power, onehas to reckon with the fact that an adept who is not of the whitest nearlyalways suffers from that unpleasant psychic disease of “hypertrophied ego.” Hewill love power for its own sake, and take any defection on the part of anerstwhile follower, or any resistance to his imperious will as a personal insultor even injury. With a trained mind, an angry thought will do damage, and I haveknown cases of occultists who, out of pure pique, went to extraordinary lengthsof spite. One can only hope that they did not really believe in the efficacy ofwhat they did, and were merely playing to the gallery “pour encourager lesautres” and ensure loyalty among their supportets.Another thing which is particularly disliked by this type of adept is anyattempt on the part of a pupil who has broken with him to make use of what hehas been taught. There seem to be no lengths to which a jealous guru will not goin order to smash his chela psychically.In one case which came to my knowledge a concert singer had had “treatment” forthe improvement of her voice from an adept of sorts. She finally decided thatshe would spend no more money on this enterprise, and told him so at the visitwhich she had decided should be the last. He concentrated his gaze upon her andtold her that if she broke with him, as soon as she went on the concert platformshe would see his face in the air in front of her, and her throat would closeand she would be unable to utter a sound, and that this horrible experiencewould occur every time she tried to sing until she returned to him and continuedto have “treatment” (at a guinea a time). This potent hypnotic suggestion provedeffective, and her career was at an end until the spell was broken.The following letter contains a very illuminating experience, and is of value,not only for its account of a psychic attack, but also for its description ofthe manner in which the attack was combated.“In the winter of 1921-1922 I was told (from the Inner Planes), ‘We see yourinitiation into the Order of the Christ.’ I did not understand very clearly andI waited.”In June, 1922, an Oriental, the head of a great religious Order, came to see me.(I was living in Switzerland.) We will call him Z. I expected great things fromhim and looked on him as a sort of Master. Knowing that he had met Abdul Baha, Ithought to please him by putting A.B.'s photo on my walls, but when Z. enteredmy room I saw at once that he did not quite like it. We conversed for a whileand he asked me several questions. Suddenly he offered me initiation into hisOrder. I was taken aback and did not feel the inner consent. I said I mustreflect. Later on an inspiration(P) came to me and I said, ‘Is your Order theOrder of the Christ?’ He answered, ‘It is.’ I told him of my experience (relatedabove) and accepted initiation; but I had the inner conviction that all was notright.“I felt no inner response to several incidents during the initiation, and Ibegan to call mentally and earnestly upon the Christ, and kept on doing so untilthe end of the ceremony. (I learned afterwards that he had told one of hisdisciples that I had accepted initiation but not the Master.)“It would take too long to relate other less important details so I go on to oursecond interview during which he asked me several times to leave the town whereI was and to join him in active work. This time I heard the inner voice clearly;it said, ‘No.’ Suddenly he said, ‘Sit in front of me; I will heal you.’ (I wasin very bad health at the time.) He fixed his eyes on mine with a strongcommanding gaze. Mentally I called on the Christ and I felt form all round me asort of shell. ‘There,’ he said, T have healed you.’ The inner voice said, ‘No.’“Well, he went away and I had a “bad time” for I had the feeling that all wasnot right, though I had no suspicion of evil. (Nor have I now.)“I wrote an account of this interview to a friend, and a letter from her crossedmine. She told me that about the time of my interview with Z., of which she wasunaware, she was told to join our spiritual teacher in helping me. She withdrewfrom the Outer Planes, and then she realised that strong hypnotic forces wereplaying upon me in waves. Again and again she had to use all her spiritual powerto help me withstand them, but finally we stood on a rock, bathed in light andfree.' My letter gave her the key to it; but she replied, ‘Take care, Z. willtry again. He realised that he was baffled; he will try on the Inner Planes nexttime.’“Now comes the great experience. A few weeks later, at night, I had a very vividvision, it seemed; but it was a real experience. I was in the middle of a groupof seven or eight persons of whom I saw two clearly. On my left was a womanentirely veiled in black, but she made a startlingly clear figure for all that.On the right was Z. He said, ‘Now I will give her the second, the higherinitiation.’ And he seized my right arm with force. But I disengaged myself, andstanding straight and calm I said (I can hear myself now). Before this ceremonyproceeds I wish to make a statement. I can allow nothing and no one to comebetween me and the Christ.’ There was a howl, a tossing of hands and everythingdisappeared.“Soon after I tore up my initiation card, put Z. out of my mind and have had noconscious personal experience of him since. But I had introduced him to a youngFrench musician of high social standing, whom he found much to his taste. (Wewill call him F.) There is a close friendship between F. and me, and at thattime he needed some Oriental music for one of his compositions - on the otherhand, he might have been extremely useful to Z., towards whom he felt stronglyattracted. After my own experience I began to be much alarmed, but felt that Iwas not big enough to deal with the situation, so I said nothing to F. butprayed that he might be protected from all evil. Shortly afterwards F. told mein his letters of various astral experiences. In his dreams he was going throughall sorts of disagreeable things and voices kept saying to him, Ask Z. to helpyou. He will help you.' Then he became conscious of my presence and begancalling on the Christ (all this in his dream) and everything vanished. Thishappened more than once. Only when I met him again did I tell him of my ownexperience.“I must add that a friend with psychic power came to see me at this time andsaid, ‘This last week, at night, I have seen you three times. You asked me tohelp you save a young man who was in danger. What did it mean?”The above case indicates clearly the deliberate use of mental power by Z. Hispretence of “spiritual healing” being an obvious attempt at hypnosis. Mycorrespondent says definitely that she has never suspected him of deliberateevil; rather was he acting rightly according to his lights. I maintain, however,that any attempt to dominate others, or in any way to manipulate their mindswithout their consent, is an unwarrantable intrusion upon their freewill and acrime against the integrity of the soul. How can we judge the intimate spiritualneeds of another, especially if that other has not elected to confide in us?What right have we to invade his spiritual privacy and thrust our tamperingfingers into the wheels of his innermost being? It is so common a practice tosend the names of people to healing circles with a request that they should beconcentrated upon, without taking the preliminary precaution of asking theirpermission, that I have heard it announced from the platform of a largeSpiritualist public meeting that only those cases could be taken up which gavetheir written consent.Fortunately for all concerned, the proceedings at such “healing circles” areusually so futile that nobody need mind being concentrated upon by them even ifthey were attempting murder.The principle, however, remains, and I can only record my opinion once more, asI have already recorded it many times, that such a proceeding is an outrageousbreach of good manners and good faith, and contrary to all occult tradition. Ithink I can honestly say that I have never wished to direct the great currentsof destruction upon my fellow-occultists, but there are some of them I wouldlike to get face downwards across my knee!"},{"pageContent":"> 13 THE MOTIVES OF PSYCHIC ATTACK: PART I > Love-philtres Image [images/00004.jpg] Psychic pressures Image> [images/00004.jpg] Congressus subtilis Image [images/00004.jpg] Lilith of the> Qabalists Image [images/00004.jpg] “Counterparts” Image [images/00004.jpg] The> sons of God and the daughters of men Image [images/00004.jpg] Incident of> astral projection in a liaison Image [images/00004.jpg] Curious case of> substitution Image [images/00004.jpg] Fairy matings Image [images/00004.jpg]> Etheric aspect of sex-congress Image [images/00004.jpg] Incubi and succubi> Image [images/00004.jpg] Magical experiments of Mr. X: (a) with an unmarried> girl; (b) with a married woman Image [images/00004.jpg] Unnatural vice. WE HAVE NOTED in a previous chapter that the simplest way to find out whetherthe victim of an alleged psychic attack is romancing or not, is to seek formotives, and if they are not discernible, to give imagination the benefit of thedoubt. The commonplace motives of greed, lust, revenge and fear of betrayal donot need psychic discernment for their discovery but are perceptible to thenaked eye. There are other motives, however, that may be operative in occultcircles but which would be passed by unsuspected by the ordinary investigator.The old charm-books that have come down to us, mostly via the servants' hall,are replete with recipes for securing the love of the opposite sex. The ancientgrimoires supply more elaborate ritual prescriptions, and the reports ofwitch-trials contain frequent indictments of the wise woman who, for aconsideration, undertook to direct people's affections towards persons for whomthey apparently had no natural predilection. Are such operations to be takenseriously, or should we class them with the anti-fat pills that reduce withoutdieting?We have already referred to the old love-philtres. The ancients were wellacquainted with the aphrodisiac drugs which excited sexual passion. Nor are themoderns altogether ignorant of them, as carefully-worded advertisements incertain astrological publications reveal. There are firms in France whichspecialise in the manufacture of chocolates which contain masked doses of thesedrugs. Publicity was given to their production recently owing to the death oftwo girls and a man through taking overdoses. There are cocktails in use in thiscountry containing so-called “tonic” ingredients whose effect is well known. Ifthese are not “love philtres,” what are they?We are not concerned in these pages with methods that belong solely to thephysical plane, but these matters call for mention because there are grounds forbelief that upon more than one occasion, even in this country, aphrodisiacs havebeen employed as an adjuvant to occult ptactices. There was a certain firm whichbegan to advertise extensively and was building up a nice business in what mightbe called “occultist's sundries.” Among other preparations which they suppliedwas “Incense for the operation of Venus.” However, the firm came to an untimelyend through the intervention of the police, both partners going to jail.But apart from the use of purely material means, it is not difficult to see whatuses could be made of mental influence in this direction. I have seen severalcases that looked extremely, suspicious, but in these matters it is verydifficult to get at the facts. The manner of attack is intangible and leaves notrace, and the victim may be unsuspicious and entirely ignorant not only of thepsychic side of sex, but also of its physical and subtler emotional aspects.Moreover, those who have suffered most usually talk least. One may occasionallyhear of the attempt which was frustrated. The attempt which was successful veryrarely comes to light because the victim has just as much motive for concealingit as the aggressor.When we come to purely occult practices, there are two ways in which the desiredend can be achieved; psychic pressure may be brought to bear upon the desiredperson so that he or she shall come under the influence of the operator; or thepsychic operation known as wngressus subtilis may take place.What exactly is congressus subtilis? We shall have to know a good deal more thanwe do at present about the occult side of sex before we can answer thatquestion. In the first place, what are the facts, or alleged facts, of thematter? The ancients held very definite beliefs upon the subject, and thesebeliefs can very often afford us a clue, even if we do not accept the veryanthropomorphic explanations by which they are accompanied.It was believed that the arch-demon Lilith had a very great deal to do withthese matters. According to the Qabalists, Lilith was the first wife of Adam,who used to visit him in his dreams while he was as yet alone in the Garden ofEden, and the Lord God became so perturbed at these goings-on that He createdEve as a counter-attraction. Witches were the recipients of similar attentionsfrom the Devil. St. Theresa of Avila records that the Godhead Itself visitedher. The Virgin Mary received the Holy Ghost. St. Anthony was tempted byapparitions of beautiful female demons. There are many cases on record of wholenunneries being attacked by the Devil, who visited their members. George Moore,in his exceedingly interesting study of convent life, Sister Theresa, gives anaccount of an outbreak of “Counterparts” among the younger nuns, in which theyformed liaisons with angelic lovers, who were supposed to be the souls of thosewho were drowned in the Flood. We read in Genesis and in the Book of Enoch thatthe Sons of God mated with the daughters of men, and the demonic race was theresult. The folk-lore of every country contains instances of the mating ofhumans with elementáis, usually with disastrous consequences. Classicalliterature is full of stories of the visits of gods and goddesses to human kind.What shall we say of all such stories? Is there any element in them beyondfairytale and wish-fulfilment? We can readily understand the motive of the nunwho, wishing to conceal the identity of her paramour, declares herself to bewith child by the Devil. We can equally understand the psychology of the rest ofthe convent that take up the story and see the Devil in every corner.Let me cite certain cases which have come within my personal knowledge and seewhether in the light of these we can sift fact from phantasy. There came tovisit me once a young man who was in love with a married woman. He told me thatupon several occasions he had had a very vivid dream of visiting her, and shehad simultaneously dreamed of receiving his visit. He was anxious to perfect thetechnique of this operation, hence the visit to me. I am afraid I wasunsympathetic, consequently I did not obtain any further information concerningthis curious experiment.An even more curious case came to my knowledge some years ago. A woman told methat in the days of her youth she had been engaged to marry a man to whom shewas very deeply attached, and who was murdered while working as a missionary inWest Africa. Having lost the only man she felt she could love, she consented tomarry a second cousin who had long been in love with her, and who was asemi-invalid. Whenever she had relations with her husband, she always visualisedthe form of her first lover. She herself was short, dark and petite. Herhusband, a blood relation, was similar in type to herself, and a weed into thebargain. But her three sons were tall, upstanding blond men of the nordic type,bearing a strong resemblance to the dead man. The truth of this story wasvouched for to me by a friend of the family.I have known personally two alleged “changelings.” The male had the pointed earsof Pan, and if anyone was ever a son of the Devil, he was. The female was acurious and fascinating creature, essentially non-human, and when her child wasborn it came into the world with no more trouble than a kitten. Both thesebeings were conceived when their mothers were under the influence of drink, andboth of them were characterised by a marked callousness, which in one casedeveloped into deliberate cruelty. Although very peculiar to look at, neither ofthem was in the least defective, both being, in fact, possessed of considerablymore than the average share of brains.Anyone who has any knowledge of the esoteric aspect of sex knows that union isas much etheric as physical. It is this fact which constitutes the realdifference between normal union and self-abuse, and explains why the former isvitalising and harmonising, and the latter is exhausting and nerve-wrecking. Maywe not conceive it possible for anyone who can project the etheric body, or abeing whose densest vehicle is etheric, to play a part in unions under certainconditions? And if we accept the theory of medium ship, or of obsession, whichis a pathological form of mediumship, what shall we say concerning thepossibility of a union while one or other of the partners is under control? Whatmanner of soul might come through into incarnation under such conditions?Mediaeval tradition recognised two classes of demons which invade sleep, andcalled them Incubi and Succubi. These were held to be responsible for lasciviousdreams. Modern psychology discounts their services and looks nearer home. Thepsychic, however, is of the opinion that there is something in the old belief,and that the lustful imaginings of men's hearts (and women's too, for thatmatter) do indeed produce artificial elementáis according to the methoddescribed in a previous chapter, and that these elementáis are something morethan subjective images, and have an objective etheric existence and play theirpart in the genesis of certain experiences. For instance, a person may havedreams and phantasies of a lascivious nature, and these may give rise to theircharacteristic thought-forms; these thought-forms, now existing independently ofthe mind that originally conceived them, and being in the aura of that person,give him suggestion just as any other thought-forms projected telepathicallyfrom the mind of another person might do. We little realise the extent to whichwe give ourselves telepathic suggestion by means of extruded thought-forms. Weare, in fact, ensphered by our own atmospheres, emanated by ourselves. Iremember being told as a child that if a bird-cage were hung immediately underthe canopy of an old-fashioned four poster bed, the bird would be found dead inthe morning, poisoned by the carbonic acid gas exhaled by the sleeper lyingbelow. We little realise the extent to which we are psychically poisoned by ourown emanations of unguarded and unpurified thoughts.It is well known that orgasm takes place in dreams, accompanied by appropriatedream-pictures. The ancients believed that such an experience was due to theaction of demons. Moderns believe it to be due to physical tension. It is not sogenerally known that there are people, both male and female, who can produce thesame reaction at will solely by means of day-dreams. May we not ask ourselveswhether it cannot also be produced by means of telepathic suggestion, andwhether this may not have played a part in the operations of many covens?There is another curious phase of this aspect of the Left-hand Path, which wasbrought to my knowledge through a case which came into my hands. A young girl,simple-minded and unsophisticated, living a very isolated life with a widowedmother, went to consult a well-known psychic, whom we will call Mr. X. In thecircle in which both Miss Y. and Mr. X. moved there was another, and prominentfigure, whom we will call Mr. Z., who had a reputation for a knowledge of magic.Mr. X. told Miss Y. that he had read the records of her past lives, and thatthere was a karmic tie between herself and Mr. Z., and that she could help himin his work by pouring out upon him her love and magnetism. She was instructedto meditate upon Mr. Z. every night as she lay in bed, until she fell asleep.This poor girl, lonely and unsuspicious, gave herself up unreservedly to thistask. Presently, however, she began to grow uneasy. Her common sense asserteditself, for she found the meditations she was required to perform were having avery disturbing effect upon her; but Mr. X. allayed her fears and recalled herto her allegiance by assuring her that he had looked into the future and seenthat eventually Mr. Z. would marry her. By now she had upon her hands aheart-breaking love affair which was making her very unhappy and unfitting herfor work. A number of letters upon the subject were exchanged between Miss Y.and Mr. X., which I have seen. I did my best to persuade her to drop the wholeaffair. Mr. X. succeeded in persuading her to go on with it, playing upon herfeelings and telling her how terrible would be the plight of Mr. Z. if shewithdrew her psychic support, and renewing his assurance of a karmic tie whichwould result in an ultimate marriage if she were faithful. Miss Y, pitifullydistressed and bewildered, betook herself to certain of the leaders of theorganisation to which all three of them belonged. These people seconded myadvice that she should discontinue these practices, but persuaded her tosurrender the very compromising letters which were in her possession. Havingsecured these, they declared that the whole transaction was imagination on herpart, and instead of turning this choice pair of scoundrels out of their ranks,let them continue to function as usual.This would be a strange enough case if it were an isolated one, but it is not.Another woman came to me about this time in a state bordering on insanity, andtold me that she too had been consulting Mr. X., who had told her that she hadalready received initiation on the Inner Planes, though she might not beconscious of it, and that her psychic faculties were on the point of opening (astock remark of his), but if she wanted to make real progress on the Path shemust cease to live with her husband and he (Mr. X.) would put her in touch withher astral soul-mate. The consequence of this precious advice was to break upher home and send her out of her mind. One day, walking in the Park, she met Mr.Z., and declared him to be her astral lover, a statement which Mr. X. confirmed,and embellished with the information that Mr. Z. was also the Master who wouldinitiate her.I tried to persuade her to bring the whole transaction to a summary conclusionand return to her husband, but she replied that she could never do this afterthe astral experiences she had had. Mr. X. re-established his influence overher, she left the address at which I had known her, and I have never heard whatbecame of her. Her condition when I last saw her was deplorably emaciated,wild-eyed and twitching with convulsive movements.Would anyone believe the story of such a woman? Obviously no one, unless theyhad seen the letters that I had seen. Nor is this the only case; a fellow-workerof mine told me of two precisely similar ones which had come to her knowledge inconnection with Mr. X. It is cases such as these which make the honestinvestigator of occult phenomena thankful that there is upon our statute-book alaw which enables magistrates to deal effectually with occultists who prostitutetheir powers. It is so generally known that no initiate may use the occult artsfor gain that it is difficult to sympathise with people who pay some advertisingoccultist his half-crowm or half-guinea and then find themselves let in forunpleasantness.What conclusions may we draw from the incidents that I have related, for thefacts of which I can vouch from personal knowledge? Four women are persuaded toembark upon a meditation process whose aim is to pour out force. The nature ofthe force that is to be poured out is indicated by the fact that the marriedwomen are instructed not to live with their husbands and the unmarried girl isencouraged to fall in love with the man who is made the focus of the operation.This man is the head of a group of people known to be occupied with practicaloccultism and ceremonial. The conclusion I draw is that an occult experiment wasafoot, and that, regardless of the consequences to them, these women were beingmade use of in order to carry it out, the procurer being the well-known psychic,Mr. X., and the operator the notorious Mr. Z.The same group have to their credit a recurring series of scandals in connectionwith unnatural vice. If this were merely vice as such it would not come withinthe purview of these pages, but it appears to be used systematically as a meansof obtaining occult power. Those who have any knowledge of the deeper aspects ofoccultism know that sex force is one of the manifestations of kundalini, theserpent-fire that according to Tantric philosophy lies coiled at the base of thespine, or in the terms of Western occultism, the sacral plexus. The control andconcentration of the kundalini force is an important part of the technique ofpractical occultism. There is a right way of directing it throughthought-control, the technique of which I have explained in my little book, TheProblem of Purity (Rider); but there is also another method, which consists instimulating this force, and then directing it into abnormal channels where itwill not be absorbed, but remain available for magical purposes. It is for thisreason that in certain forms of the Black Mass the altar is the naked body of awoman who may either be still living, or have been slain sacrificially. A. E. W.Mason gives an account of such a transaction in his book, The Prisoner in theOpal.Less expert operators, however, cannot control this form of force; as soon asthey generate it, it has to go to its logical conclusion. They therefore employanother type of stimulus, not the woman, but the boy or youth. The practice ofpaederasty in connection with occultism is very old, and was one of the causesof the degeneration of the Greek Mysteries.I have dealt with these subjects in some detail in another book of mine, SaneOccultism.* Particulars of the actual cases can be found by reference to thefiles of Truth, the journal already referred to."},{"pageContent":"> 14 THE MOTIVES OF PSYCHIC ATTACK: PART II > Disputes with occult fraternities Image [images/00004.jpg] Powers of the> penalty clause in initiation oaths Image [images/00004.jpg] Incident in> initiation ceremony Image [images/00004.jpg] The Adept who defied his Order> Image [images/00004.jpg] The cat attack Image [images/00004.jpg] An astral> skirmish Image [images/00004.jpg] The Iona case again. IT IS A MATTER of general knowledge among occultists that it is not a pleasantthing to fall foul of an occult fraternity of which one has been made a memberby means of a ceremonial initiation and to which one is bound by oaths. As wehave already seen, the malignant mind of a trained occultist is a nasty weapon;how much more so the group-mind formed out of a number of trained minds,especially if concentrated by means of ritual?But in addition to the individual mental force of the members of a fraternity,and in addition to the collective force of its group mind, there is anotherfactor to be reckoned with when a genuine occult organisation is concerned inoperations of either protection or destruction. Every occult organisationdepends for its power to initiate upon what are called its “contacts,” that isto say, upon one or more of its leaders being psychically in touch with certainforces. If, in addition to this, the organisation has a long line of traditionbehind it, a very potent collection of thought forms will be built up in itsatmosphere. Every initiation ceremony contains in some form or other the Oath ofthe Mysteries, which binds the candidate neither to reveal the secrets of theMysteries nor to abuse the knowledge they bestow. This oath always contains aPenalty Clause and an Invocation wherein the candidate submits himself to apenalty in the event of a breach of faith, and calls upon some Being to exactthe penalty. Some of these oaths are most formidable affairs, and they areadministered with every circumstance of solemnity that stage management candevise. The way in which the occult fraternities have succeeded in preservingtheir secrets shows how seldom these oaths are broken.In the event of a dispute with an occult fraternity, the force invoked in thisoath may come into action automatically. If the recalcitrant brother is in thespirit of the tradition and it is his chiefs who are at fault, the power invokedin the oath will be a potent protective influence with which the chiefsthemselves will collide. If, on the other hand, he breaks faith with theMysteries, this avenging punitive current will come into action although hisdefection may pass undiscovered. I was informed by an eyewitness of an incidentwhich took place at an initiation, in which the candidate, a man to allappearances normal in every way, after taking the oath in the usual manner,suddenly screamed most terribly, startling everyone, and was ill for some weeksas if from a severe nervous shock, and never had anything more to do withoccultism. No explanation of the incident was ever forthcoming. I was presentmyself upon one occasion when a batch of three candidates was being “done,” andit was suddenly noticed in the course of the ceremony that the number of thecandidates had become reduced to two. Enquiry elicited the fact that the thirdhad taken fright and fled.What happened in these two cases, I do not know; whether there had been a breachof good faith, or whether one was intended, no one can say; but something putthe fear of the Lord into these two individuals pretty effectually. That no suchshock is inherent in the ceremony is proved by the fact that these are the onlytwo cases in my experience, and I have seen a very large number of ceremonies.Personally, when I took my own initiation I felt as it I had come into harbourafter a stormy voyage.Another man who was intimately known to me as an advanced occultist was turnedout of the Order to which he belonged, why, I do not know, but from what I sawof him I should imagine there were plenty of reasons. In defiance of hisinitiation oath he began to work an independent lodge. He was warned to desist,and did so, dismantling his temple. But he immediately began to get togetheranother temple in a carefully concealed place; and this time he was moreambitious, for he made ready to attempt the Greater Mysteries. He was anexceedingly clever craftsman and made all the equipment of the temple with hisown hands so that no one should know what was afoot. Concealed behind Nottinghamlace curtains in a mean street in West London was a beautiful little temple ofthe Greater Mysteries. He completed this work after some months of arduous toil,no one knowing of it save those in his immediate confidence. But beforecommencing the actual ritual work he went away for a short holiday at theseaside, and there he was seized with a heart attack while sitting on the beachand died in four hours. The Order secrets were not betrayed.Another man who had had a dispute with the same famous Order, printed andpublished their secrets as an act of revenge. He was a man of good socialposition, considerable wealth and brilliant literary abilities, already making aname for himself as a writer. From that moment he began to go downhill, and cameto poverty and disgrace. The curse of Ahasuerus seemed to be upon him, and hewas hounded from country to country, finding no abiding place. No publisher willhandle his books, no paper will review them.Let me finally tell of my own experiences in an astral skirmish. I wrote aseries of articles on the abuses prevalent in occult fraternities, and thesewere published in the Occult Review* My writing is largely inspirational, agreat deal “coming through” of which I have no previous knowledge, and in thisparticular case I evidently shot a great deal better than I knew, and got myselfinto serious trouble. My first intimation of it was a sense of uneasiness andrestlessness.Next came a feeling as if the barriers between the Seen and the Unseen were fullof rifts and I kept on getting glimpses of the Astral mingling with my wakingconsciousness. This, for me, is unaccustomed, for I am not naturally psychic,and in the technique in which I was trained we are taught to keep the differentlevels of consciousness strictly separate and to use a specific method foropening and closing the gates. Consequently one seldom gets spontaneouspsychism. One's vision resembles the use of a microscope in which one examinesprepared material.The general sense of vague uneasiness gradually matured into a definite sense ofmenace and antagonism, and presently I began to see demon faces in flashes,resembling those picture-images which psychologists call by the unpleasing nameof hypnagogics, flashes of dream which appear upon the threshold of sleep. I wasquite unsuspicious of any particular individual, though I realised that myarticles had probably stirred somebody up pretty thoroughly; what was mysurprise, then, to receive from a person whom I looked upon as a friend and forwhom I had the greatest respect, a letter which left me in no doubt whatever asto the source of the attack and what I might expect if any more articles werepublished. I can honestly say that until I received this letter I had not theslightest suspicion that this person was implicated in the scandals I wasattacking.I was in a somewhat difficult position; I had fired off a charge of shrapnel ongeneral principles, and had apparently “bagged” a number of my friends andassociates and fluttered the dove-cote generally. My position was rathercomplicated by the fact that I did not know nearly as much as they apparentlysuspected me of doing; I had, of course, known that these abuses existedsporadically about the occult field as everybody in the movement knows; but toknow in this vague way is one thing, and to put one's finger on specific casesis another. I had evidently blundered into something much more considerable thanI had bargained for. I felt like the small boy who, fishing for minnows, hashooked a pike. I had to decide whether I would try and get my articles back fromthe Occult Review, or whether I would let them run their natural course and takethe consequences. I had had a very strong impulse to write those articles, andnow I began to see why I had had it. I shall have something to say in anotherchapter concerning the Watchers, that curious section of the Occult Hierarchywhich is concerned with the welfare of nations. A certain section of their workis apparently concerned with the policing of the Astral Plane. Very little isactually known about them. One comes across their work sporadically and piecesthe bits together. I have crossed their trail on several occasions, as I willtell later. Whenever black magic is afoot, they set to work to put a spoke inits wheels. Be that as it may, I came to the conclusion that, in view of whathad now transpired, the impulse I had had to take in hand this piece of workmight have emanated from the Watchers. At any rate, the work obviously neededdoing. Someone had to tackle these plague spots if they were to be cleared up,so I determined to stick to my guns and see the matter through, and so left thearticles in question to run their course.Very soon some curious things began to happen. We became most desperatelyafflicted with black cats. They were not hallucinatory cats, for our neighboursshared in the affliction, and we exchanged commiserations with the caretakernext door who was engaged in pushing bunches of black cats off doorstep andwindow-sill with a broom, and declared he had never in his life seen so many, orsuch dreadful specimens. The whole house was filled with the horrible stench ofthe brutes. Two members of our community at that time went out to business everyday, and at their offices, in different parts of London, they found the samepenetrating reek of the tom-cat.At first we attributed this persecution to natural causes, and concluded that wewere near neighbours of some fascinating feline female, but incidents succeededeach other which made us feel that things were not quite in the ordinary courseof nature. We were getting near to the Vernal Equinox, which is always adifficult time for occultists; there was a sense of strain and tension in theatmosphere, and we were all feeling decidedly uncomfortable. Coming upstairsafter breakfast one morning, I suddenly saw, coming down the stairs towards me,a gigantic tabby cat, twice the size of a tiger. It appeared absolutely solidand tangible. I stared at it petrified for a second, and then it vanished. Iinstantly realised that it was a simulacrum, or thought-form that was beingprojected by someone with occult powers. Not that the realisation was any toocomforting, but it was better than an actual tiger. Feeling decidedlyuncomfortable, I asked one of my household to join me, and as we sat in my roommeditating we heard the cry of a cat from without. It was answered by another,and another. We looked out of the window, and the street as far as we could seewas dotted with black cats and they were wailing and howling in broad daylightas they do on the roofs at night.I rose up, gathered together my paraphernalia, and did an exorcism then andthere. At the end we looked out of the window again. There was not a cat insight, and we never saw them again. The visitation was at an end. Only ournormal population of local mousers remained to us.The Vernal Equinox was now upon us. I must explain that this is the mostimportant season of the year for occultists. Great power-tides are flowing onthe Inner Planes, and these are very difficult to handle. If there is going tobe astral trouble, it usually blows up for a storm at this season. There arealso certain meetings which take place on the Astral Plane, and many occultistsattend them out of the body. In order to do this, one has to throw oneself intoa trance and then the mind is free to travel. It is usual to get someone whounderstands these methods of work to watch beside the body while it is vacatedto see that it comes to no harm.In the ordinary way, when an occult attack is afoot, one clings to wakingconsciousness at all costs, sleeping by day and keeping awake and meditatingwhile the sun is below the horizon. As ill-luck would have it, however, I wasobliged to make one of these astral journeys at this season. My attacker knewthis as well as I did. I therefore made my preparations with all the precautionsI could think of; gathered together a carefully chosen group to form thewatching circle, and sealed up the place of operation with the usual ceremonial.I had not much faith in this operation under the circumstances, for my attackerwas of much higher grade than I was, and could come through any seals I mightset. However, it afforded protection against minor unpleasantness.The method of making these astral journeys is highly technical, and I cannotenter upon it here. In the language of psychology, it is auto-hypnosis by meansof a symbol. The symbol acts as a door to the Unseen. According to the symbolchosen will be the section of the Unseen to which access is obtained. Thetrained initiate, therefore, does not wander on the astral like an uneasy ghost,but comes and goes by well-known corridors.My enemy's task was therefore not a difficult one; for she knew about the time Imust make this journey and the symbol I must use in order to get out of thebody. I was therefore prepared for opposition, though I did not know what formit would take.These astral journeys are really lucid dreams in which one retains all one'sfaculties of choice, will-power and judgment. Mine always begin with a curtainof the symbolic colour through whose folds I pass. No sooner was I through thecurtain on this occasion than I saw my enemy waiting for me, or, if anotherterminology is preferred, I began to dream about her. She appeared to me in thefull robes of her grade, which were very magnificent, and barred my entry,telling me that by virtue of her authority she forbade me to make use of theseastral pathways. I replied that I did not admit her right to close the astralpaths to me because she was personally offended, and that I appealed to theInner Chiefs, to whom both she and I were responsible. Then ensured a battle ofwills in which I experienced the sensation of being whirled through the air andfalling from a great height and found myself back in my body. But my body wasnot where I had left it, but in a heap in the far corner of the room, whichlooked as if it had been bombed. By means of the well-known phenomenon ofrepercussion the astral struggle had apparently communicated itself to the body,which had somersaulted round the room while an agitated group had rescued thefurniture from its path.I was somewhat shaken by this experience, which had not been a pleasant one. Irecognised that I had had the worst of it and had been effectually ejected fromthe astral paths; but I also realised that if I accepted this defeat my occultcareer was at an end. Just as a child who has been thrown by his pony mustimmediately get up and remount if he is ever to ride again, so I knew that atall costs I must make that astral journey if I were to retain my powers. So Itold my group to pull themselves together and re-form the circle because we mustmake another attempt; I invoked the Inner Chiefs, and went out once more. Thistime there was a short sharp struggle, and I was through. I had the Vision ofthe Inner Chiefs, and returned. The fight was over. I have never had any troublesince.But when I took off my clothes in order to go to bed my back felt very sore, andtaking a hand-glass I examined it in the mirror, and I found that from neck towaist I was scored with scratches as if I had been clawed by a gigantic cat.I told this story to some friends of mine, experienced occultists, who at onetime had been closely associated with the person with whom I had had thistrouble, and they told me that she was well-known for these astral attacks, andthat a friend of theirs after a quarrel with her had had an exactly similarexperience, and she too had been covered with claw-marks. In het case, however,she had been ill for six months and had never touched occultism again.There is a curious epilogue to this story, which may or may not have any bearingupon it. I have already told the story of the mysterious death that took placeon Iona. How the body of this unfortunate girl was found lying naked on a crosscut out of the turf. No cause of death could be found, and the verdict was thatshe died of exposure. But if she were lost, how did she come to lie down to diein this ritual manner, instead of wandering about? Why had she taken off all herclothes before leaving her house, covering herself only with a black cloak? Andwhy did she take with her the large knife with which she cut the cross in theturf? I do not know her later history, for I had lost sight of her during thelast two or three years of her life, but at the time I knew her she wasassociated with the woman I have referred to. The only marks found upon her deadbody were scratches."},{"pageContent":"> PART IV> METHODS OF DEFENCE AGAINST PSYCHIC ATTACK "},{"pageContent":"> 15 PHYSICAL ASPECT OF PSYCHIC ATTACK AND DEFENCE > Need of caution in presuming that a psychic attack is being made Image> [images/00004.jpg] Effect of neglected constipation Image [images/00004.jpg]> Septic foci Image [images/00004.jpg] Proper diagnosis and treatment of> physical conditions an essential preliminary Image [images/00004.jpg] Any> serious case should be under the supervision of a qualified medical> practitioner * Effect of sleeping Image [images/00004.jpg] Draught Image> [images/00004.jpg] Effect of sea and mountains * Effect of food Image> [images/00004.jpg] Effect of heat and pressure Image [images/00004.jpg] Effect> of diet Image [images/00004.jpg] All psychic work to be avoided by the victim> of an attack. WE HAVE DISTINGUISHED the various types of psychic attack, we have described themethods that can be employed in carrying them out, and we have also noted thevarious forms of delusion, fraud and auto-suggestion that may complicate theissue. We are now in a position to discuss the question of diagnosis. Let usconsider the whole matter from the practical point of view. Supposing a strangercomes with a story of psychic attack, what should be our procedure?We must first of all bear in mind that there is great need of caution inpresuming that a psychic attack is being made. Psychic attacks are comparativelyrare things. We must not assume we are dealing with one until we have excludedall the other things it can possibly be. Not so long ago I came across a ease ofalleged obsession which turned out to be neglected constipation, and which waseffectually exorcised with castor oil. If there are any physical symptoms atall, even if they are no more than a bad colour or a bad breath, a diagnosisought to be made by a qualified medical practitioner, for even if the troublehave a predominating psychic element, its origin may be physical. Septic fociare really centres of decomposition, and as such they open the door to low formsof elemental life whose function is to assist in the return of dust to dust.Impurities in the blood-stream may poison the brain. New growths or abscessesmay derange its functions. These things can only be recognised by the man whounderstands the body; other things being equal, the trained man is the betterman, and the man with the best training is the best man, and the only placewhere an adequate training in diagnosis can be obtained is a general hospital.Moreover, should things turn out badly, the only person who can pull thechestnuts out of the fire is the person whose signature the authorities willaccept on a certificate. Supposing the patient turns out to be a lunatic, whatis the unqualified practitioner going to do with him? A very large proportion ofthe cases of alleged psychic attack turn out, to be lunatics and hysterics.Incipient lunacy is a very hard thing to detect; hysteria is very cunning andplausible; a doctor who is handling human nature in bulk every day of his lifewill detect either of these two conditions much quicker than the layman who hasnever met them before.It may be objected that it is a very difficult thing to find a doctor who willhave a sympathetic attitude towards occultism. To argue thus is to misunderstandthe position. The doctor is not being asked to cooperate with any occultoperation, but to examine for physical disease, and if he finds it, to treat it.He is no more concerned in the occult measures that are taken for the benefit ofhis patient than he is in the church his patient attends.If the doctor finds no evidence of organic disease, or some complaint such asvaricose veins which can obviously have no bearing on the mental condition, thecase may be held to have passed the first test, and we may feel that it is worthwhile to proceed to the psychic investigation. If the case is a bad one, or thetrouble is of long standing, the doctor will probably find that the patient isdebilitated, even if there is nothing definitely amiss, and will proceed totreat the condition accordingly. This is all to the good, for the better thephysical condition of the patient the more mental control and stamina he willhave. Sleeping-draughts, however, should be avoided if possible, and if theyhave to be administered, then the patient should be watched while he sleeps bysomeone who knows how to keep an occult guard, and the room in which he sleepsshould be purified and sealed. In the ordinary way, if a person who is out onthe astral meets with an occult attack, he bolts back to his body like a rabbitto its burrow and wakes up as if from a nightmare; but if the sleep is madeunnaturally deep by a sleeping-draught, he cannot wake up, and is locked out onthe astral, as it were, which is the last thing one wants in the case of apsychic attack. If a sleeping-drought is considered essential, for it isimpossible to go without sleep indefinitely, the person who is watching besidethe sleeper should observe carefully any signs that the sleep is being disturbedby dreams, and if he observes muttering or twitching, should immediately performthe necessary banishings and whisper into the ear of the sleeper soothing andreassuring suggestions such as Coue recommends should be done in the case ofyoung children. One of the most distressing features of a psychic attack is thatthe victim fears to sleep because he feels that in sleep he is defenceless.Those who have read Kipling's terrible story, The End of the Passage, mayremember that the victim of the occult attack therein described always went tobed wearing spurs in order that he might rowel himself and so wake himself up ifhe were struggling with his invisible enemy during sleep.There is a great deal that can be done upon the physical plane to help theperson who is suffering from an occult attack, and we may as well consider thesephysical methods while we are upon the subject of the part that can be played bya doctor in dealing with the case. Sunlight is exceedingly valuable because itstrengthens the aura and makes it much more resistant. People are often advisedto go away into the country on this account, but for the victim of an occultattack to go into the depths of the country may not be the wisest thing, becauseelemental forces are much more potent away from towns, and if he is threatenedby an up rush of atavistic forces, he had better cling to the haunts of men. Thesea, too, is an elemental force that is best avoided, for water is an elementintimately associated with psychism. Large bodies of water and high mountainsshould be avoided in choosing a health resort for a person suffering frompsychic trouble. The best place is an inland spa. Games, physical training,massage, anything that improves the bodily condition, are invaluable, but longsolitary walks should be avoided because there is often a risk of suicide. Theperson who is the victim of an occult attack should at all costs avoid solitude.There is another very simple measure which, gives immense relief in cases ofpsychic interference. It is obvious that the attack is made through the psychiccentres, therefore anything which closes those centres will render the victimcomparatively immune. It is well known how the stolid, materialistic type ofperson can live with impunity in haunted houses that drive the sensitive tomadness and suicide. It is also well known that psychic work cannot be performedif there is food in the stomach; the best results are always obtained whenfasting. The obvious corollary of these facts is that if we want to keep thepsychic centres closed, we should not allow the stomach to become empty. Theperson who is facing a psychic attack should not go more than two hours withoutfood.Certain important psychic centres are in the head. One of the simplest ways ofchecking their activity is by drawing the blood down from the head. This can bedone effectually by a hot bath or putting the feet in hot mustard and water.Another important centre is the solar plexus; during a psychic attack this isoften felt to be tense and distressing. A large hot-water bottle, well filled sothat it is heavy as well as hot, laid upon the solar plexus, which is thehand-breadth between the pit of the stomach and the ribs, will effectuallyrelieve tension in that spot. Indeed, pressure without heat will give relief,and I have known cases where a firm pad held in place by a belt or corsets gavemuch comfort.Above all things, the bowels should be kept freely open while facing a psychicattack, because there is nothing that puts one at so great a disadvantage as theaccumulation of effete matter within the body.All these simple physical remedies are readily available. They will not afford acure for psychic pathologies, nor a complete defence from psychic attack, butthey can give great relief from distress; they enable the victim to put up amuch more effectual resistance, and by relieving the strain they increase hisendurance. In many cases of psychic attack, he who endures longest wins; psychicattacks by human beings are not things which can be maintained indefinitelybecause they use up too much energy.There is an old adage, “Never use a big spade if a little spade will do.”Physical methods of defence involve much less outlay of energy that psychicones, therefore it is psychically economical to make as much use of them aspossible. Why trouble to exorcise the earth elements with a ritual if you can doit with a pill?The question of diet also requires to be considered in this connection. Thewidespread propaganda of the Theosophical Society has caused vegetarianism to beregarded as a sine qua non of occult training. This, however, is not the case.The Western Esoteric Tradition does not make vegetarianism any part of itssystem, but teaches that a man should partake sparingly and temperately of thefood of the land in which he finds himself. Personally I am inclined to thinkthat occultism and vegetarianism are apt to be an injudicious mixture for anEuropean, the result being a hypersensitiveness that makes life very difficultin our hard-driving civilisation.Vegetarianism has to be thoroughly understood and exceedingly well done if it isto be successful, and even so, there is a goodly proportion of people who areincapable of digesting vegetable proteins, which are not nearly so easily dealtwith as animal substances. Nothing but experience and experimentation can showwhether a vegetarian diet suits a given person. Indigestion is not the onlyindication that all is not well. Loss of appetite, loss of energy, loss ofweight, or a flabby stoutness are all danger signals which if disregarded willcause chronic ill-health. Vegetarianism may agree with a person well enough atfirst, but after a considerable period, possibly years, they may find that theyare becoming subject to neuritis, neuralgia, sciatica, or one or another of thenerve pains. This is a sure indication that a vegetarian diet is affordinginsufficient nourishment, not because it does not contain the necessary foodunits, but because the digestion is unable to assimilate them and they arepassing out of the body unchanged. Wherever there is a history of neuralgicpains complicating a case of psychic disturbance, I should be inclined tosuspect chronic malnutrition as the cause of a hypertrophied psychism. In suchcases it will probably be found that a gradual return to nourishing mixed dietwill bring about a reduction of the hypersensitiveness, the undesirable contactsthat have been formed will fade, and the condition return to normal. The changeof diet, however, should always be made gradually lest the digestion be upset.Anyone who is having trouble with psychic disturbance should immediatelydiscontinue all occult practices and should exchange his habitual meditationsfor the prayers of his childhood, or New Thought methods. It is no time to openup the psychic centres when there is astral trouble. The thing to do in suchcases is to get back on to the physical plane and stop there resolutely. Therewas a picture in an old number of Punch which to my way of thinking exactlyexpresses the correct attitude for the person afflicted by psychic trouble. Infront of an old-fashioned four poster bedstead stands a ferocious female armedwith a rolling-pin, and from under the valance protrudes the head of her spouse,who says, “Ye may whack me, and ye may thwack me, but ye canna break my manlyspirit, for I'll no cam' oot.”If the victim of an occult attack concentrates on mundane things he is aheart-breaking proposition for any sorcerer. What is the sorcerer to do if, atthe time when he is operating the Black art, his victim is at the local cinemaroaring at the antics of Charlie Chaplin? There is an old saying that one naildrives out another. If in fear of invisible dangers, take up a sport with anelement of risk in it."},{"pageContent":"> 16 DIAGNOSIS OF THE NATURE OF AN ATTACK > Physical condition may cause psychic centres to open Image [images/00004.jpg]> Delirium Image [images/00004.jpg] Problem of diagnosis Image> [images/00004.jpg] Method of approach Image [images/00004.jpg] Use of> psychometery Image [images/00004.jpg] How to take a psychometric specimen> Image [images/00004.jpg] Value of astrology Image [images/00004.jpg] How to> take a history Image [images/00004.jpg] How to detect a liar Image> [images/00004.jpg] Indirect approach Image [images/00004.jpg] Points of> correlation Image [images/00004.jpg] Influence of places Image> [images/00004.jpg] Influence of persons Image [images/00004.jpg] Need of> caution in apportioning the blame Image [images/00004.jpg] The investigator> should make an independent diagnosis and check it by the psychic's report> Image [images/00004.jpg] Limitations of psychometry. HAVING CONSIDERED the purely physical factors in a psychic disturbance, we maynow come to the consideration of its genuinely psychic factors. We must alwaysbear in mind, however, that because physical disease is found, it does notnecessarily eliminate the psychic factor. A physical condition, such as anabnormal state of the blood, may cause a low form of psychism and put its victimin touch with evil astral conditions. Science may call it delirium orhallucination, but the occultist calls it pathological psychism and can do agreat deal to relieve it, either by closing down the psychic centres, or byexcluding evil psychic influences from the environment of the patient so thatthe spirits he sees shall be angelic instead of demonic, and cause him happinessinstead of distress. The psychic centres forced open by a diseased blood-streamperceive anything that comes within their range of vision. Therefore let usensure that nothing save what is pleasant shall come near them. We may not beable entirely to keep him off the Astral, but at least we can ensure that hiswanderings shall be in a safe and pleasant part of the Astral. People do notrealise the extent to which the wanderings of delirium can be directed andcontrolled by suggestions whispered into the ear of a sick person. We cancompanion the sick man in his astral wanderings and make our voice heard amonghis visions, by our knowledge driving away the evil presences that threaten himand guiding his dreams into the way of peace.At the commencement of our diagnosis we must distinguish between three broadclasses of psychic disturbance: those which are a by-product of physicaldisease, those which are due to malicious human action, and those which are dueto non-human interference. The first type should be readily picked out by thedoctor if, as has already been advised, recourse has been had to him as theessential preliminary. Moreover, he will also be effective in eliminating thefrauds, for people moving in psychic circles and familiar with their terminologymay simulate a psychic attack either in order to borrow money or obtainhospitality, or out of pure love of notoriety, a far commoner motive for humanaberrations than is generally realised. Frauds usually either fade away orrecover quickly when threatened with a physical overhaul. Those who decide tochance their luck are pretty quickly caught out by the man who has served histime in the out-patient department of a general hospital.The diagnosis which the occultist has to make therefore lies in distinguishingbetween the attack of an incarnate mind and the attack of a discarnate mind.There are two ways in which he can do this, and he ought to use them both, sothat they countercheck each other. He ought to get at least two independentpsychics to psychometrise the case, and he himself ought to make his owndiagnosis entirely from the case-history interpreted in the light of firstprinciples. It is a great mistake to mix the psychic and the scientific. Theyare apt to neutralise each other. Let one person do the psychism and another theobservation, and let proper precautions be taken to prevent the results of theclairvoyant investigation being vitiated by suggestion, or by thethought-reading of previously conceived opinions held in the mind of any of thepersons concerned. It is therefore a good thing to send off the specimens forpsychometrising at the commencement of an occult investigation, before anyopinions have been formed.It is not the simplest matter in the world to take psychometric specimensproperly. I have seen a man bring a lock of hair belonging to someone else outof his pocket, where he had carried it about for a couple of days, and hand itover for psychometry. It was of course so thoroughly impregnated with his ownemanations as to be useless. A psychometrical specimen should be some objectthoroughly impregnated with the vibrations of a person. A garment recently andhabitually worn, a lock of hair, a piece of jewellery, all these can be made toserve provided they are properly preserved. Crystalline substances, such asprecious stones, hold magnetism better than anything else; metals are also good,whether precious or otherwise. A pocket-knife, for instance, will hold magnetismwell. Wood holds it badly and so do paper, wool, cotton and artificial silk,especially the latter. Silk and linen are good. India-rubber is useless. Glassdepends for its holding powers upon its form. If it is cut so that it willrefract light it can be very good; if it is flat and purely transparent, likewindow-pane, it is almost useless. Stone is fair. Earthenware poor. An elaboratearticle is not as good as a simple article. For instance, a marquise ring is notas good as a signet ring. Letters are apt to be misleading because they oftencontain nearly as much of the magnetism of the recipient as of the writer. Somepsychics can work from a photograph, but this method is not, strictly speaking,psychometry, for the mental image evoked by the photograph is used to pick upthe corresponding image in the reflecting ether.Great care should be used in taking a psychometric specimen, for it is readilycontaminated by the magnetism of anyone who handles it, who is in proximity toit, or who even thinks about it concentratedly. For instance, if while packingup such a specimen for sending off you are brooding over the problem it presentsand working out your own theory, the psychometrist may pick up your thought-forminstead of reading the conditions of the person to whom the object belongs. Thematerials which are used for packing should also be free from magnetism. I knewof a case wherein the psychic said that a certain trinket belonged either to anurse or to someone who had to do with hospitals. As a matter of fact, itbelonged to neither, but had been packed in surgical cotton-wool.When packing up a psychometric specimen, do it as expeditiously and with aslittle handling as possible. Take a piece of “virgin” black or white silk (notcoloured), large enough to serve as a wrapper. Throw it over the article andbundle it up rapidly, handling it through the silk. In the occult sense,“virgin” means something that has never been used for any other purpose. Forinstance, you should not use part of an old dress or a cushion-cover. An articlewhich does not lend itself to handling by this method can be picked up withsugar-tongs or the points of a pair of scissors and laid on the square of silkin which it is to be wrapped. Pack the wrapped article in a wooden box, beingsure that any padding which is used is also virgin. The report of a singlepsychometrist should not be relied upon. Specimens should be sent to two atleast. It is also well when sending specimens, and especially when sending abirth-hour for a horoscope, not to allow the name to be known lest gossip shouldbe spread about. Astrologers are much too fond of handing round charts anddiscussing them. I have known some very unfortunate things come about in thisway.A horoscope from someone who understands the nature of the work in hand is ofgreat value, for the position of the planets in the heavenly houses not onlyserves as an aid to diagnosis but is a very important guide to treatment. It isbest therefore to explain to the astrologer the nature of the case, and the kindof information that is wanted, so that he can examine the chart accordingly. Ahoroscope is to an occult therapist what an X-ray photograph is to a doctor.While awaiting these returns, and while his mind is still uninfluenced by them,the occultist should make his own independent diagnosis. In order to do this heshould have at least two interviews with his patient. In the first he shouldhear the case-history, allowing the patient to present the facts in his own way,without guidance or leading questions.Immediately the patient has left, the operator should write out the case-historywith as much detail as he can recall. It is exceedingly undesirable to takenotes in the presence of a patient, because it makes him nervous, for he feelsthat, in the words of the police-court; “everything he is saying will be takendown and used as evidence against them.”In preparation for the second interview the occultist should study his recordcarefully and have its points and sequence clear in his mind. Now is the time toquestion the patients concerning any discrepancies or hiatuses. This proceedingwill reveal the liar, whether deliberate or hysterical, quicker than anythingelse, for the discrepancies of his second statement will be clearly revealedagainst the written record of his first. If he is telling the truth, the twostatements will be in agreement. If he is distorting the facts, he will sooncontradict himself.Remember that you are dealing with a person who has something of either thepsychic or the neurotic, or very likely both, in his disposition, and that yourattitude towards him, and even your unspoken thoughts, will influence himprofoundly. If he feels that you are doubting his veracity, he will lose hisself-confidence and begin to think that his experiences may, after all, be thefruits of his own imagination. Consequently, he will suppress things which maybe all-important from the diagnostic standpoint. It is in this outpouring ofrelevant and irrelevant detail that you are going to find your clues.There are certain landmarks which you want to look out for in taking thiscase-history, but you do not want to let your patient realise what you arelooking for, because if you have won his confidence, he will be very apt to takeon your viewpoint, and if he sees you have formed any opinion, he willunconsciously twist incidents so that they fit in with that opinion. Do notallow him to guess the bearing of your questions, and then you will obtain fromhim an unbiassed response. In order to prevent his guessing what you are drivingat, do not ask a series of questions elucidating information on a specificpoint. There will probably be several points on which you want information. Askquestions upon first one and then another of these. For instance, if you suspectthat the trouble may be due to the house in which your patient is living, thelast thing you want to do is to rouse his suspicions in this respect lest youshould be on a false scent. And even if you should prove to be on the righttrack, you do not want to disclose the facts to him until you are ready to act,for by increasing his apprehensions you will increase his sufferings. If yoususpect that sex plays a part in his trouble, and he guesses the trend of yourquestionings, he will immediately cover his tracks, and you will find it verydifficult to get at the facts at all. Whereas, if his suspicions are notaroused, he will reveal himself to an astute and experienced questioner whoapproaches him indirectly, without realising that he has done so. By approachingthus indirectly you not only get at the real facts of the case, but spare hisfeelings.In taking a case-history you want to look for correlations between yourpatient's psychic experiences and the circumstances of his life. Dates andplaces therefore should be sedulously sought for. When did the trouble start,and where? Having obtained as detailed information as possible on these twopoints, set out to see whether any occult significance is to be found in it.Note the dates carefully, and turn them up in an ephemeris of those years, andobserve how the moon stood in relation to them, also the planets. Observewhether they fell on or about the equinoxes or solstices. Note also the days ofthe week upon which they occurred. If you found that all the crises of the caseoccurred on Thursdays, or round about the Vernal Equinox, or at the full moon,you would have a piece of information which was of considerable significance.You would be sure of one thing, at any rate, that you were dealing with a casein which the invisible psychic tides played a part.Information should also be sought concerning the place or places in which thedifferent crises of the trouble took place, and especially the circumstancesattending its first onset. It is exceedingly useful if possible to visit theplace and sense its atmosphere.A very great deal can also be learnt from visiting the place where the patientis living.Having obtained such geographical information as you can, study it carefully inconnection with a large-scale Ordnance map. Access to this, and to an relevantinformation desired can readily be obtained at any public library. Note whetherthere are any prehistoric remains in the neighbourhood, and if so, how the housebears in relation to them. Observe not only whether it is near any of them, butwhether it is in a direct line between any two of them. Look up the history ofthe district, and see whether it affords any further information. Roman remainsare often at the bottom of the trouble, for the legions brought some very queercults with them in the days of Rome's decadence. Druid remains, too, should besuspect of they are near neighbours.Enquire also concerning any unusual objects in the house, such as images of thedeities of primitive culrs or savage weapons. It is quite possible that powerfulelementals are attached to these.Enquire whether the trouble seems to lift when the patient goes away to anotherplace. If the reply is in the affirmative, it may safely be presumed that localconditions are at the bottom of the trouble. But if the reply is in thenegative, it does not necessarily follow that the opposite is the case. It mayalso be that the trouble does not depend upon the place, but upon some personresiding at the place. Never forget that in the great majority of cases thatperson's harmful influence is due to an unfortunate psychic make-up rather thandeliberate abuse of occult knowledge. Be very slow to accept the latterhypothesis, for its occurrence is comparatively rare. And even if the personsuspected is known to have occult knowledge and can be proved to be antagonisticto the patient, it does not necessarily follow that the attack is conscious anddeliberate. It may be unconscious and reflex. It is quite true that an occultistought to have sufficient control over his vehicles to prevent them from actingindependently of his will and consciousness; but this is not always the case.People are at many different stages of development. There is always a difficultperiod between the awakening of the higher powers and their full control.Enquiries should also be made concerning the nature of the dreams, and whetherthe patient is subject to nightmares apart from any question of occult attack.Also whether he has ever had any other psychic experiences, and if so, of whatnature.Finally, a careful enquiry should be made concerning the patient's associates,as to whether any of them are psychic, or students of the occult. Be verycareful, however, not to cast suspicion upon any person unless you haveconclusive evidence and it is essential to do so in order to save the patient.Remember it always possible that you may be mistaken. A case was reported in thepapers not so long ago of a man who committed suicide because a doctor told himthat he had organic heart disease and ought not to marry the girl he was engagedto. At the post mortem it was found that there was nothing whatever the matterwith his heart. Imagine the feelings of the doctor who had given this rashdiagnosis. A person already upset by a psychic attack will be in a state to jumpat shadows. He must be handled very discreetly. Be very chary of announcing yoursuspicions until they are conclusively verified. When all is said and done, themain object is a cure, not an explanation. It is of little value to your patientto fix the blame unless the matter can be cleared up. He is considerably worseoff if his suspicions are turned towards some person in his environment fromwhom he cannot escape, than if he be left to attribute his trouble tounidentified psychic influences. Where ignorance is bliss ‘tis folly to be wiseis truer in psychic matters than anywhere else. Never open the eyes of yourpatient to a danger for which you cannot give him an effectual defence. Thesurgeon who is about to operate covers his instruments with a cloth so that thepatient shall not see them. The wise occultist does the same. Do not forget thatthe Unseen is always suspect to the uninitiated.Having conducted an enquiry along the lines laid down in the previous pages, youshould have acquired a considerable amount of material for investigation.Examine it carefully for correlations of cause and effect. Note if anyexacerbation of the trouble is regularly associated with any incident, place, orperson. Consider also the various type-cases that I have given as examples inthe previous chapters, and see if you can find any that resemble the case youare investigating. Note the explanations given, and see if they throw any lightupon the problem, or suggest lines along which enquiry might be pursued.Working in this way, you ought to be able to arrive at a tentative diagnosis. Ifthis is confirmed by the findings of the psychics to whom you have sentspecimens for psychometry, then you may feel confident you are upon the righttrack and go forward boldly.Remember, however, that although the psychics ought to agree as to the mainpoints of their investigation, you cannot expect any complete agreement as todetails. They are inspecting a composite photograph of the patient's entirelife, and there is so much to see that no one person is likely to seeeverything. The things in which they confirm each other may be held to beestablished, but the things which the one sees and the other does not are notnecessarily illusionary."},{"pageContent":"> 17 METHODS OF DEFENCE: PART I > The non-initiate and exorcism Image [images/00004.jpg] Clearance of psychic> atmosphere Image [images/00004.jpg] Getting rid of magnetism Image> [images/00004.jpg] Running water Image [images/00004.jpg] Incident of the> conduit Image [images/00004.jpg] Electricity and bacteriology Image> [images/00004.jpg] Formula for preparing holy water Image [images/00004.jpg]> Physical phenomena Image [images/00004.jpg] Etheric magic in the East Image> [images/00004.jpg] Precautions to be taken against it Image [images/00004.jpg]> Disposal of the by-products of the Body Image [images/00004.jpg] Substances> employed in Black Magic Image [images/00004.jpg] Use of garlic for> purification. IN WRITING FOR the general reader an account of the methods to be used incombating a psychic attack, I am reminded of those excellent manuals uponmedicine and surgery which an enlightened Board of Trade insists shall beprovided for the captains of ships, together with a cupboard full of remedies,harmless and otherwise. When an emergency arises, the worthy skipper readsthrough the chapter he believes to bear upon the case in hand and goes to workas best be may. On these occasions the personal factor is a large one.So it is in dealing with psychic trouble. Wide experience is needed fordiagnosis, and specially trained faculties and specially developed powers areneeded to cope with the conditions that may be found. This book is more in thenature of a manual of first aid than a treatise on treatment.We must also bear in mind that just as the potent drug is effectual in the handsof the expert but dangerous in the hands of the amateur, so do the more potentoccult formulae need special equipment for their use. Moreover, a formula thatis used indiscriminately by the uninitiated is apt to lose its potency andbecome useless. The popular expletive which G.B.S. introduced into politesociety in his play, Pygmalion, is the worn-out remnant of the once-powerfuladjuration, “By Our Lady.” Moreover, no two cases are alike, and the clear-cut,typical case is a rarity and treasure. Common sense, natural aptitude andexperience are the exorcist's best equipment.Having made his diagnosis and being ready to proceed to the handling of thecase, the exorcist has to achieve three things: he must repair his patient'saura, clear the atmosphere of his environment, and break his contact with theforces that are causing the trouble. These three things are interdependent, andnot one of them is first or last. It is next to impossible to get a damaged aurato heal if you do not clear the atmosphere; nor will the atmosphere remain clearfor long if you cannot break the contacts.Theoretically, the ideal thing to do is to break the contacts as a start. Butunfortunately, in actual practice, these often take a good deal of finding, anda good deal of handling after they have been found. Meanwhile, something has tobe done to keep the patient going. The exorcist has got to clear himself a placein which to work. Or if the victim of the attack is defending himselfsingle-handed, he has got to throw up some temporary defences while he digshimself in.The first thing to do when dealing with an occult attack is to make a temporaryclearance of the atmosphere and so gain breathing-space in which to re-form theshattered ranks. This is more readily achieved by an organised ritual than byunaided will-power. Any act performed with intention becomes a rite. We can takea bath with no more in mind than physical cleanliness; in which case the bathwill cleanse our bodies and no more. Or we can take a bath with a view to ritualcleanliness, in which case its efficacy will extend beyond the physical plane.We therefore perform certain physical actions not only as a means of clearingetheric conditions, but also as a means of definitely effecting astral onesthrough the imagination, a very potent weapon in all magical operations.Physical objects become impregnated with etheric emanations and retain them forconsiderable periods as a knife will retain a smell of onions and tainteverything that is cut with it. These emanations, magnetism as they are calledin the terminology of occult science, profoundly affect any sensitive person whois in contact with them. There is something in the old superstition that it isunlucky to place boots on a table. It is equally inadvisable to place outdoorgarments on a bed. You do not know whom you have rubbed shoulders with in bus ortrain, so why give their magnetism a chance to contaminate your sleeping-place?Fortunately for all of us, magnetism is a very fugitive force, and although itmay be potent when fresh, it soon fades unless it has been deliberately createdby means of ritual. The terrible atmosphere that surrounds the victim of anoccult attack and permeates all his belongings is not difficult to get rid of,though it will rapidly re-form unless the conditions which gave rise to it arecleared up.The most effectual way of getting rid of magnetism is to move to a fresh place,taking nothing of one's old belongings with one.This, however, is a counsel of perfection for most people. Fortunately there areother devices which enable us to attain our ends nearly as effectually. If it bein any way possible, let the victim of an occult attack move temporarily toanother environment, taking with him as few of his belongings as possible, andlet him make the move in new clothes, or in clothes that are just back from thecleaner. Let him, moreover, keep his whereabouts a secret as far as it isconvenient for him to do so.There is an old superstition that a witch can be thrown off the trail bycrossing running water. It is my opinion that many of these old folk-beliefshave a basis in fact, however overlaid by superstition they may have become. Ionce had a curious experience which gives support to this opinion. I was aboutto take part in an important piece of occult work to which I knew there would beopposition. A friend who was concerned in the matter asked me to dine with heron the night before the day fixed for the proceeding. We were both conscious oftension in the atmosphere, and she suggested that I should remain the night ather flat instead of returning to my own, informing no one of my whereabouts inorder to throw the attack off the trail. The man oeuvre was not whollysuccessful, and we had a rather trying night, and I was conscious of a good dealof psychic tension next day. I decided therefore to walk to the appointed placeacross Hyde Park in order to refresh myself. When part of the way across, Isuddenly felt that the tension relaxed, and I was able to go through the work inhand without interference. I told my friend of this experience, and shequestioned me as to where I was when it took place. We looked up the spot on amap and found that I had just crossed the underground conduit which takes theoverflow from the Serpentine. I did not know of the old superstition concerningrunning water, neither did I know of the existence of the conduit. Nevertheless,the sense of relief was sufficiently marked to cause me to mention it when I sawmy friend again, and to be able to indicate the spot where it had occurred.We have very little exact knowledge concerning these subtle forces which are thebasis of both occult attack and spiritual healing, but we have good reason tobelieve that in their nature they are closely analogous to electricity. They arenot inanimate forces, however, but have in their nature something that is akinto life, though of a low type. It has been my experience that if we work on ablended analogy of electricity and bacteriology, we get pretty near the facts;as near, at any rate, as our present state of knowledge permits. In other words,if we act as if thought possessed the combined qualities of electricity andbacteria we shall have a sufficiently accurate method of steering by deadreckoning in the absence of certain knowledge and actual sight. If we considerthe various methods used in folk-magic of all ages and races, we shall observethat they are in agreement with these hypotheses.Running water, we know, has peculiar electrical qualities, as is witnessed byits effect on the divining-rod in the hands of a sensitive person. Whatever itmay be that affects the diviner is probably the same thing that affects theoccult attack. When we recall, moreover, that running water will throw houndsoff the scent just as effectually as it will the alleged witch, we may feel thatwe cannot be accused of gross superstition if we give the old folk tradition atrial and note the results.Water, again, is the vehicle of purification. It is used in the rite of baptismby the Church and in the Preparation of the Place by the occultist about toperform a ceremony. Strictly speaking, there should be a trace of salt in thewater thus employed, and both salt and water are blessed with powerfulinvocations when the priest is preparing holy water, whether for a baptism, orfor placing in the holy-water stoup for the use of the congregation.As far as the occultist is concerned, salt to him is the emblem of the elementof earth. It is also a crystalline substance, and crystalline substances, intheir different forms, receive and hold etheric magnetism better than anythingelse. Water, on the other hand, is the emblem of the psychic sphere. These tworealms, between them, contain by far the greatest part of occult evil. It israre indeed that spiritual wickedness in high places will reach up as far as theairy realms of mind or the fiery realms of spirit. If we want to get into touchwith, or operate upon a particular sphere, we use as base a substanceappropriate thereto. Consequently, a solution of salt and water makes a betterbase than either salt or water could do separately because it enables us tocover the whole of the sphere of probable operations in a single act. It may beinteresting to note concerning the magical properties of crystalline substances,that crystals are used in wireless apparatus to pick up the subtle vibrations ofthe ether. Once again we are close upon the trail of our electro-bacteriologicalanalogy.It is an excellent plan, when trying to break an undesirable psychic contact, toimmerse oneself in a bath of water that has been especially consecrated for thepurpose; re-dressing in new or at least clean clothing afterwards, and if it beby any means possible, moving into a different room. If this cannot be done,move the bed into a different position, taking care to turn it at a differentangle; that is to say, if you have been in the habit of sleeping lying north andsouth, place your bed so that you will now be lying east and west.The following prayers may be used for the blessing of the salt and water:“(Pointing the first and second fingers at the salt.) I exorcise thee, creatureof earth, by the living God (+), by the holy God (+), by the omnipotent God (+),that thou mayest be purified of all evil influences in the Name of Adonai, Whois Lord of Angels and of men.(Extending hand over salt.) Creature of earth, adore thy Creator. In the Name ofGod the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of Jesus Christ His Son,our Saviour, I consecrate thee (+) to the service of God, in the Name of theFather and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.(Pointing first and second fingers at the water.) I exorcise thee, creature ofwater, by the living God (+), by the holy God (+), by the omnipotent God (+),that thou mayest be purified from all evil influences in the Name of ElohimSabaoth, Who is Lord of Angels and of men.(Extending hand over water.) Creature of water, adore thy Creator. In the Nameof God the Father Almighty, Who decreed a firmament in the midst of the waters,and of Jesus Christ His Son our Saviour, I consecrate thee (+) to the service ofGod, in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.(Casting the salt into the water.) We pray Thee, 0 God, Lord of Heaven andEarth, and of all that in them is, both visible and invisible, that Thou mayeststretch forth the right hand of Thy power upon these creatures of the elementsand hallow them in Thy holy Name. Grant that this salt may make for health ofbody and this water for health of soul, and that there may be banished from theplace where they are used every power of adversity and every illusion andartifice of evil, for the sake of Jesus Christ our Saviour. Amen.”The water thus consecrated may be used as a bath, or for making the Sign of theCross upon the forehead, or for sprinkling about a place. When thus using it,the following prayer may be employed:“In the Name which is above every other name, and in the power of the Father andof the Son and of the Holy Ghost, I exorcise all influences and seeds of evil; Ilay upon them the spell of Christ's Holy Church, that they may be bound fast aswith chains and cast into outer darkness, that they trouble not the servants ofGod.”In pointing or making the Sign of the Cross (+), the first and second fingersare extended and the third and fourth are bent towards the palm of the hand andthe thumb laid upon their nails. When the hand is extended in blessing over thesalt and water, it is held flat, fingers together and parallel, the thumbstretched at right angles to the forefinger.If there is sufficient occult force at work to produce physical phenomena, it isvery advisable to take precautions to prevent materialisations taking place. Thephysical phenomena are of several types. They may take the form of noises,usually creakings, thuds, or more rarely bell-like notes or wailing sounds. Ifactual words are heard, auditory hallucinations should be suspected, for in theabsence of a medium, spirit messages are given to the inner ear, not to theauditory nerve. Lights may also be seen, usually taking the form of dim balls ofluminous mist drifting like soap-bubbles. They may be any size from mere pointsof light to considerable dimensions, some six feet or more in diameter. In thesespheres of dim luminosity psychics can generally see forms, sometimes human,sometimes from the animal kingdom. Whitish grey clouds can also sometimes beseen, rising pillar-wise from the floor like smoke. These are usually fixed toone place and do not move about the room as do the spheres of light, suchmovement as occurs being within themselves, like the eddyings of smoke caughtunder a tumbler. More rarely a distinctive odour may be noticed, and still morerarely there may be precipitations of powdery substances or slime. Light objectsalso may be overturned or thrown about the room.There are certain substances which experience has proved to be effectual inpreventing the condensation of etheric energy from taking place. Consecratedsalt dissolved in vinegar and placed in saucers about the room will copeeffectually with low degrees of force, but for higher potencies nitric acid isthe best thing to use, a small quantity being poured into a saucer and exposedto the air. It is best to use it well diluted to prevent accidents, for it isnot the strength of the acid in the saucer that is efficacious, but itsevaporation into the air, and it will evaporate just as well when diluted aswhen neat. In what manner it works I have not the slightest idea, but its valueis well known among psychic experimenters.The methods of occult attack employed in modern Europe are exclusively mental,so far as my experience of them has gone at any rate. That is to say, they workby the mind on the mind, and only affect physical conditions incidentally. Inthe East and among primitive people, however, other aspects have to beconsidered, as a much more etheric type of magic is in use under primitiveconditions of life and upon virgin soils. For these etheric operations, materialsubstances are required in order that the magnetism attached to them may be madeuse of. Hair combings, nail-parings, cast-off clothes, objects in familiar use,all contain magnetism. Consequently care should be taken to see that such thingsare effectually disposed of when discarded. Combings and nail-parings should bepromptly burnt. Cast-off clothing should never be allowed to go out of thepossession of the owner till it has had at least three days' exposure to sun andair in the open. The magnetism will be more effectually dispelled if thegarments be laid on the earth, especially freshly turned earth, than if hung ona line. The same applies to furniture. The chair that has been the accustomedseat and, above all things, the bedding, should be thoroughly aired and sunnedbefore they are parted with. The same precautions are useful if any second-handarticle has been purchased.The disposal of night-soil should also be carefully arranged for and entrustedto reliable servants, abundant disinfectants and deodorants being constantly inuse. Precautions should be observed to prevent any native obtaining access tofresh excrete. After the animal heat has gone out of it, its magical value hasgreatly decreased. A dirty handkerchief, too, is an effectual magnetic link, andso are dressings from a wound. Anything, in fact, that bears traces of any ofthe by-products of the body.But apart from any question of psychic attack, there are two substances whichare especially prized for purposes of magic, and these are seminal fluid andmenstmal blood. The former is used in fertility rites and the latter in certainforms of evocation. These substances are exceedingly hard to come by inprimitive lands, because the natives, knowing their significance, guard themmost scrupulously; but the memsahib has no suspicions, and allows stainedgarments and bed linen to go into the hands of the washer man to be disposed ofat his discretion, satisfied so long as the garments themselves return safely atthe end of the week, and never thinking to enquire what becomes of the water inwhich they were washed. There are many parts of the world in which the sale ofthese magical substances is a profitable sideline of the laundering business.In Europe, menstrual blood and faeces are part of the magical substances of theBlack Mass, being made up into patens with wheat flour.A time-honoured method of clearing a bad psychic atmosphere out of a house, andone which I have known in my own experience to be effectual, is to strew garlicabout the place, leave it overnight and then take it up and burn it. Amongcountry people, an onion is sometimes placed in a vase on the mantelpiece as ifit were a hyacinth bulb when unpleasant visitors are expected, and solemnlyburnt in the kitchen fire as soon as they have departed, it being believed thatthe onion tribe have the property of absorbing noxious emanations. It is curiousto note in this respect that in one coal mine to my knowledge the miners areforbidden to take onions down into the workings as part of their dinners becausethe onions absorb the underground gases and become poisonous. My informant toldme that he and others had smuggled onions down and learnt from bitter experiencethe wisdom of this rule."},{"pageContent":"> 18 METHODS OF DEFENCE: PART II > The meditative method Image [images/00004.jpg] The invocative method Image> [images/00004.jpg] Value of a combination of the two Image [images/00004.jpg]> Attack by thought-forms Image [images/00004.jpg] Attack by thought-force Image> [images/00004.jpg] Magnetic fields Image [images/00004.jpg] Formula for making> a magic circle Image [images/00004.jpg] The Qabalistic Cross Image> [images/00004.jpg] The Sword of Power Image [images/00004.jpg] The Circle of> Flame - Use of incense Image [images/00004.jpg] The Banishing Pentagram Image> [images/00004.jpg] Incident of the split panel Image [images/00004.jpg]> Formula for sealing the aura Image [images/00004.jpg] Method of making astral> shields Image [images/00004.jpg] How to prevent hypnosis Image> [images/00004.jpg] Value of the sacraments. HERE ARE TWO types of practical psychic work which may be used separately or incombination, the latter method, in my opinion, giving by far the best results,though the exponents of each are apt to decry the other. The method which wewill distinguish as the meditative method consists of meditation upon abstractqualities, such as peace, harmony, protection and the love of God. It is themethod of the New Thought school, and its value lies in the harmonising effectit has upon the emotional state and its counteracting of harmfulauto-suggestions. The other method, which we will call the invocative, consistsin the invocation of external potencies and the employment of formal methods forthe focussing of their force. This method has many gradations of complexity andan infinite variety of technique. It ranges from the simplest prayer which callsupon Christ with the Sign of the Cross, to the most elaborate rituals ofexorcism performed with bell, book and candle. The essence of the system lies inthe attempt to dissect out from the general force of good the particular aspectof energy that is needed, and the use of some symbol to act as the magicalvehicle of that force upon the plane of form. This symbol may be a mentalpicture of the blue robe of Our Lady; it may be the action of making the Sign ofthe Cross; it may be the consecrated water sprinkled for token of cleansing; orit may be some object specially magnetised to act as a talisman. In theinvocative method the aim is to concentrate the force, and therefore some symbolof form has to be employed. In the meditative method the aim is to escape beyondthe bounds of form into the atmosphere of pure spirit, too exalted for evil toenter, and therefore the use of any form or formula is eschewed as calculated toprevent the soul from rising into this pure air.In my opinion, and with all due respect to the practitioners of this lattermethod, much better results would be obtained if the invocative method, with itsutilisation of the efficacy of formula, were used to enable the mind to climbinto the pure air of spiritual consciousness where no evil is. It is only thosewho are highly trained in meditation who can rise on the planes unaided. It isexceedingly difficult to “take off from sense-consciousness without the use ofsome kind of psychological device to act as a spring-board. There seems to belittle object in refusing for purely academic reasons to avail ourselves of amethod of proven efficacy. If we realise that the use of forms and symbols ismerely a psychological device to enable the mind to get a grip on theintangible, we shall not fall into the error of superstitious observances. Asuperstition has been defined as the blind use of a form whose significance hasbeen forgotten.On the other hand, we shall be unwise to rely exclusively upon formal orceremonial methods unless at the same time we use meditative methods in order topurify and harmonise our own consciousness. If we neglect this aspect of ourwork, we shall re-infect by our own vibrations the magic circle as fast as wehave cleared it. It is not much use sealing a circle with the protective Namesif we allow a panic-stricken imagination to run riot, picturing everyconceivable kind of evil and leaving blank spaces for the possibility ofinconceivable kinds. Equally, however, we shall find it very much easier toperform the harmonising meditation if we are working within the protection of amagic circle. To attempt to perform the work of exorcism solely by means ofmeditation is like raising a weight by the unaided effort of our two hands. Theemployment of the magical method resembles the use of a lever, or a pulley andblock. Our muscles are still the sole source of energy, but by the utilisationof mechanical principles we have redoubled their Let us, then, in meditation,use symbols to concentrate our attention; we shall find this much easier thanmeditation in terms of abstract thought. Indeed, in times of stress and crisis,abstract thought may be impossible for us unless we are very experienced in itsuse; but we shall seldom reach a state when we cannot picture the Cross and callupon the Name of Christ.Occult attacks may be divided into two types, those which take place by means ofthought-forms, and those which operate by means of a current of force. But evenin the latter case the current of force soon gathers to itself or germinatesthought-forms congenial to its nature. Therefore in every psychic disturbancethe thought-form is a factor which has to be considered and dealt with, andwhich, in fact, forms the readiest means of diagnosis; for it is by theperception of the associated thought-forms that the experienced psychic is ableto detect the nature of the attack.Thought-force is a thing which has no relation to geographical position, but isa matter of pure consciousness and of tuning in to its key-note. We can pick upthe forces of dead faiths a thousand years after the death of their last votary,and upon the opposite side of the globe to that in which they flourished. Butthought-forms are a different matter. They have position in space, and althoughthey can be moved about with the speed of thought, and can be withdrawn to thesubtlest level of the astral and there anchored to an idea and thus preventedfrom impinging upon the planes of form for all practical purposes, nevertheless,although they do not occupy space, they can be referred to definite positions inspace. They can, for instance, be associated with a particular object, and willfollow that object about, remaining within its magnetic field. The immediatemagnetic field is anything from twelve to thirty feet; the remote magnetic fieldfrom a hundred to three hundred yards. Powerful holy centres, like Glastonburyor Lourdes, have a bigger magnetic field than this, extending possibly to acouple of miles; they are also inter-connected among themselves by lines offorce. These things have to be taken into account in practical occult work.When we are confronted by a disturbing influence emanating from a focus ofpower, such as the site of an old temple, we have got to deal with the remotemagnetic field by means of ceremonial. As this is a method that can only be usedby a high-grade initiate, we will not consider it here. For all practicalpurposes in a psychic attack it is the immediate magnetic field that has to beconsidered.The best method to deal with this is to make a magic circle. A mere banishing byitself is not so effective as a banishing performed within a circle, because thecircle will effectually prevent the banished forces from flowing back again.There are various methods of performing this operation, but the principle of allvalid ones is the same. The more potent conjurations cannot be given in thesepages, because their effective use depends upon the grade of initiationpossessed by the person who proposes to use them, and to possess a formulawithout the grade to which it belongs is as unsatisfactory as possessing a gunwithout any knowledge of shooting. The formula I will give will be foundeffectual for all ordinary conditions. Extraordinary conditions can only bedealt with by a person who has had experience.In making the magic circle the operator stands upright facing east. He faceseast because the magnetic current on which he proposes to operate runs from eastto west. His first procedure must be to steady his own vibrations and purify hisaura. In order to do this, he makes the Qabalistic Cross on breast and brow.Touching his forehead he says, “To Thee, 0 God (touching his solar plexus) bethe Kingdom (touching his right shoulder) and the Power (touching his leftshoulder) and the Glory (clasping his hands) unto the ages of the ages. Amen.”By this formula the operator affirms the power of God as sole creator andsupreme law of the universe to which all things must bow, and he establishesthis formula magnetically in his aura by the action of making the Sign of theCross upon himself. This Sign is not an exclusively Christian symbol, and can beused as readily by the Jew as the Churchman, for it is the Equi-limbed Cross ofNature that is being used, not the Calvary Cross, of which the shaft is doublethe length of the cross-bar, and which is the symbol of sacrifice. TheEqui-limbed Cross refers to the four quarters of the globe and the fourelements, and the formula associated with it proclaims the dominion of God overthese, and thereby occultly formulates His kingdom within the sphere of theoperator.The operator next imagines himself to be clasping in his right hand a large,cross-handled sword, such as is depicted in pictures of Crusaders. He holds itpoint upright and says, “In the Name of God I take in hand the Sword of Powerfor defence against evil and aggression,” and imagines himself to be towering upto twice his natural height, a tremendous armed and mailed figure, vibratingwith the force of the Power of God with which he has been charged by hisformulation of the Sword of Power.He now proceeds to draw the Magic Circle upon the floor with the point of theSword of Power, and he should see in his imagination a line of flame followingthe point of the Sword, consisting of small flames, such as spring up whenmethylated spirit is spilt and ignited, but of a pale golden colour. A littlepractice should enable this circle of light to be formulated effectually. Keepon going round the circle until it is formulated. The circle should always be,drawn deosil, that is to say, from east to south, to west, to north, in the sameway that the hands of a clock would move were the clock laid face upwards on thefloor. The contrary way is widdershins, the way in which the witches danced atthe Sabbats. The deosil movement affirms the rule of God's law in Nature becauseit is the Way of the Sun; the widdershins movement repudiates God's rule overNature by moving against the sun. In resisting an occult attack the wholeformula should be tuned to the key-note of asserting God's dominion over allexistence, the aim of the operator being to align himself with Cosmic Law andcause the Power of God to deal with the interference.The circle being formulated, the operator ceasing to visualize the sword burstill visualising the circle, clasps his hands in prayer, and raising them abovehis head towards the east, prays, “May mighty Archangel Raphael protect me fromall evil approaching from the east.” Turning to the south he repeats the sameformula in prayer to Michael. Turning to the west, he invokes Gabriel. Turningto the north he invokes Uriel. Facing to the east again, and thus completing thecircle, he repeats the formula of the Qabalistic Cross.This formulation of the magic circle is especially valuable for protecting thesleeping-place, the circle being drawn around the bed. It is not necessary tomove about the room, or shift the furniture in order to draw the circle, it willbe formulated wherever it is visualised to be.It is necessary to reaffirm this circle each time the tides change that is tosay, a circle made after sundown will hold good till sunrise, and a circle madeafter sunrise will maintain its potency till sunset. After the circle has beenaffirmed a number of times in the same place its influence will persist for aconsiderable period, but it is advisable to re-formulate it morning and eveningduring the active phase of an attack. Incense burnt within the circle is veryhelpful, but care has to be exercised in the choice of an incense. Joss-sticksof unknown composition should never be used, as they are usually compounded witha view to assisting manifestation. Good quality church incense, such as can bebought at most church furnishers, is safe and satisfactory because it iscompounded according to traditional recipes; cheaper qualities may not fulfilthese conditions.In dealing with elementáis or non-human entities the Pentagram, or Pent alpha,is the best weapon. This is a five-pointed star drawn in a particular way.Pointing the first and second fingers of the right hand, and folding the othersinto the palm and touching their tips with the thumb, proceed to draw thePentagram in the air, keeping the elbow stiff and swinging the arm at fulllength. Start with the right arm across the body, the hand about the level ofthe left hip, the extended fingers pointing downwards and outwards. Swing itupwards, as if drawing a straight line in the air, until the fingers pointstraight upwards above the head at arm's length. Now sweep it down again,keeping the elbow stiff, until the hand occupies the corresponding position uponthe right side to that from which it started on the left. You have now drawn agigantic V upside down. Next swing the hand across the body, on a risingincline, until it is stretched on a level with the left shoulder, pointing tothe left. Bring it across the body horizontally until it is in the same positionon the right, fingers pointing away from the body. Now swing it downwards acrossthe body till the hand has come back to the point by the left hip whence itstarted. This is an exceedingly potent sign. The value of the Five-pointed Star,the symbol of Humanity, is widely known among occultists, but its potencydepends upon the manner in which it is drawn. The method I have given is thecorrect one for banishing.The potency of the sign may be illustrated by an experience of my own in usingit, which the sceptical are at liberty to doubt if they wish; I merely mentionit for the sake of those who may be interested.I was taking part in some work with an Indian occultist when I became suspiciousthat all was not as it should be, protested, and was asked to withdraw. I didso, determined to watch proceedings from a distance, and if my suspicions wereconfirmed, to have an expose. A few days later I was sitting in my room oneafternoon chatting with a friend; it was just getting dusk, and we were talkingby the light of a gas-fire. Suddenly we were both aware simultaneously of apresence in the room and turned spontaneously in the same direction. My friend-ensed an antagonistic presence, and I, being more psychic, saw who it was, andhad no difficulty in perceiving the form of my Indian associate in an egg-shapedsphere of misty yellow light. I told my friend to quit the room and wait in thehall, and as soon as the door closed behind her, I made use of the Pentagram Ihave described, together with certain Names of Power that are unsuitable fordisclosure in these pages. Immediately the appearance in the corner by the doorshattered and vanished, at the same time there was a resounding crack, which myfriend heard in the hall. I called to her to return, and as she entered sheexclaimed, “Look what has happened to the door!” and we found that one of thepanels had split clean in two. It was this that had evidently caused the loudcrack we had both heard. I offer no explanation of this incident for the goodand sufficient reason that I do not know what the explanation may be. I merelystate what happened. My readers can explain it as they please.When it is not possible to seal the room, it is a very useful thing to be ableto seal the aura. Stand upright and cross yourself, by touching forehead,breast, right shoulder and left shoulder, saying, “By the power of the Christ ofGod within me, whom I serve with all my heart and with all my soul and with allmy strength (extend your hands forward as far as you can reach at the level ofthe solar plexus, finger-tips touching, then sweep them round to the back andtouch the finger-tips together again behind you, saying), I encompass myselfabout with the Divine Circle of His protection, across which no mortal errordares to set its foot.” This is an old monkish formula. It is very effectual,but its potency only lasts about four hours.There are various other devices which are useful, not only in dealing withpsychic attacks, but in any case of undue influence or domination.If you have to interview persons whose influence you find overwhelming, imaginethat they are separated from you by a sheet of plate-glass. You can see them,and hear them, but their magnetism cannot reach you. Visualise this sheet ofglass until it appears to you to be absolutely tangible. If you have toassociate with persons who distress you, but are not actually interviewing them,imagine that they are separated from you by a brick wall, and say to yourself,“You just aren't there. I can't see you, or hear you, and you simply don'texist.”When dealing with a person who saps your vitality, interlace your fingers, andlay your folded hands upon your solar plexus, keeping your elbows pressedagainst your sides. Keep your feet touching each other. You have thus contactedall your own terminals and made of your body a closed circuit. No magnetism willgo out from you while you maintain this attitude. Your friend will probablycomplain of your lack of sympathy, however kindly you may speak.If anyone tries to dominate you by gazing intently into the eyes, do not attemptto return gaze for gaze, for this only leads to an exhausting struggle in whichyou may get the worst of it, but look steadily at the spot just above the baseof their nose, between the inner ends of the eyebrows. If you are merely dealingwith an ordinary bully, you will immediately have the upper hand. If, however,your antagonist has knowledge of mind-power, you may not be able to dominatehim, but he certainly will not be able to dominate you, and the result will be astalemate. Do not attempt to dominate him, merely keep your eyes on the spot andwait for him to weary of his attempt to dominate you. You will not have long towait.By the use of the methods described in the preceding pages any person of normalcourage and mentality, provided he avoids drugs, alcohol and long periodswithout food, can, if he does not lose his nerve, wear down any ordinary psychicattack; or in the case of attacks of abnormal potency, can at least ensurehimself time to make good his escape and seek help. The sacraments are also amost potent source of spiritual power, and a church where the Blessed Sacramentis reserved, or which is sufficiently old to have been consecrated before theReformation, is an effectual sanctuary."},{"pageContent":"> 19 METHODS OF DEFENCE: PART III > Nature of rapports Image [images/00004.jpg] Effect of rapports Image> [images/00004.jpg] Group rapports Image [images/00004.jpg] The astral link> Image [images/00004.jpg] The Watcher Image [images/00004.jpg] Method of Image> [images/00004.jpg] Destroying thought-forms Image [images/00004.jpg] Method of> absorbing artificial elementáis Image [images/00004.jpg] Method of breaking> astral link Image [images/00004.jpg] Technique of substitution Image> [images/00004.jpg] Illustrative case. PSYCHIC TROUBLE not infrequently arises owing to the formation of an undesirablerapport. In order to understand the nature of this problem we must consider thewhole subject of rapport. We have already considered in some detail the questionof telepathic suggestion. Rapport might be considered as the passive aspect ofthat of which telepathic suggestion is the active aspect. It forms, in fact, thebasic condition necessary for telepathic suggestion to take place. Two peoplewho are in rapport might be described as astral Siamese twins. Although thephysical bodies are independent units, the astral bodies are linked in such amanner that there is free circulation of astral force between them, just as thecirculatory system of the mother is connected through the umbilical cord withthe unborn child, and the same blood circulating freely through both.This fact explains many important occult phenomena. It is the real key tomarriage, and explains many facts in the relationship of parent and child. Italso accounts for some important aspects of the relation of pupil and teacher.But not only is it possible for a rapport to be established between twoindividuals, but between an individual and a group. This fact plays an importantpart in all fraternity work. It is also possible to establish rapport between ahuman being and other kingdoms of nature; with discarnate entities, superhumanbeings, and, in fact, with any form of life with which an individual can form asympathetic understanding. There must be some ground of sympathy as the basisfor the formation of a rapport, but once formed, it can be developed almostindefinitely. It is a curious fact that if a rapport is long continued, thepersons thus united gradually come to resemble each other. We all know the“horsey” type of man also the son of the soil of whom it was expressivelyremarked, Father's in the pig-stye. You'll know him by his hat.When two human beings are in rapport, the less positive of the two tends to losehis own individuality and becomes the pale reflection of the other. It is forthis reason that the Western occultist, who values individuality highly, doesnot take personal pupils in the same way as does the Eastern guru, but prefersto work through ritual with a group because this method is more impersonal. Buteven so, the individual members of a group will undergo certain changes wherebythey are tuned in to the group-tone, so that there will be a certain commondenominator which they all possess. Who cannot recognise the sign-manual of theChristian Scientist, the Theosophist, the Quaker? Any system which has groupmeditation rapidly puts its mark on its members.In this fact, of course, lies much of the value of association with a worthygroup. In it, equally, lies the detriment of association with an unworthy group.Let us consider what happens when a person of ordinary good character becomesassociated with a group of degenerate moral tone. He will either find himself insuch sharp antagonism to the group-mind that he will have no option but towithdraw, or he will rapidly but unconsciously be tuned to the keynote of hisnew associates. Without his being aware of the fact, his moral sense will havebecome blunted and he will accept as a matter of course what he would originallyhave turned from in disgust.Rapport once established, other things beside the general feeling-tone can beshared. Actual ideas can be transferred from one mind to another as intelepathy; and in the same way, vital force can be transmitted. It is this factwhich is the explanation of certain types of spiritual healing. When ethericvitality is being transmitted, it is necessary that the persons concerned shouldbe within the immediate magnetic field of each other; but when astral force isin question, this is not necessary. Transmission is independent of space.We are not now considering the legitimate use of this force for healing, or forteaching and developing neophytes, so we will not, therefore, consider its modusoperandi in detail. Enough has been said to show in what way it works. Let usnow proceed to the consideration of the practical methods of breaking such arapport if for any reason it is desired to discontinue its use.To astral vision the telepathic link appears as a ray of light, a shining cord,or some similar thought-form, because it is in this form that it is usuallyformulated by the person who is making the magnetic link. It sometimes happens,however, if the operator has a high grade of initiation, that instead ofconnecting the ray direct to the person with whom he desires to be in touch, hewill formulate an astral animal at the end of it to which he transfers a modicumof his own consciousness. This animal-form is called a Watcher; it does not acton its own initiative unless attacked, when it defends itself according to thenature of the species in whose likeness it is made. The use of a Watcher is toobtain a record of what is transpiring without the necessity of focussingconsciousness thereon. When the psychic substance of the Watcher is reabsorbedby the adept, he becomes aware of the content of the Watcher's consciousness.The disadvantage of this method lies in the vulnerableness of the Watcher topsychic attack, and the fact that its projector is affected if it is injured ordisintegrated.In dealing with a thought-form, always bear in mind that it is the product ofthe imagination, and is in no sense self existent. What the imagination has madethe imagination can unmake. If the maker of a thought-form has thought it intoexistence by picturing it imaginatively, you can equally well think it out ofexistence by picturing it clearly and imagining it bursting into a thousandfragments, or going up in flames, or dissolving into water and being absorbed bythe soil. That which is thought into existence by the imagination can be thoughtout of existence by the imagination.If what was taken for a thought-form resists destruction by this method, it isprobably an artificial elemental. Now there are two such elementáis, one kindbeing ensouled by the invocation of elemental essence into a thought-form, andthe other by the projection of something of the magician's own nature into it.If it is ensouled by elemental essence, the use of the Pentagram will serve tobanish it; but if it is of the kind that is ensouled by the magician's ownforce, another method must be used, known as absorption.Now absorption is a very high-grade method, and its successful use depends uponthe state of consciousness of the user. Each individual has to decide forhimself whether in any given case at a given moment he is in a fit state toattempt it. Unless he can completely steady his own vibrations and arrive at astate of perfect serenity and freedom from all sense of effort, he should notmake the attempt.We will, however, describe the method for the benefit of those who care to tryit.Harmonising himself by meditation upon the Christ, the adept, as soon as he issatisfied that his own vibrations are steady, proceeds to call up before hisastral vision the image of the form he intends to destroy. He sees it clearly inall its details and sinks to divine its nature, whether it is a vehicle formalice or lust, or vampiric action: these are the three most common, and it canalmost certainly be assigned to one or other of these classes. Having discernedthe type of the force with which he has to deal, he then proceeds to meditateupon its opposite, concentrating upon purity and selflessness if the force belust; compassion and love, if it be malice; and upon God as the creator andsustainer of all life if it be vampiric.He continues this meditation until he feels himself suffused with the qualityupon which he is meditating; until he feels so imbued with purity andselflessness that lust causes him to feel nothing but pity, malice causes him tofeel nothing but compassion, and in regard to vampirism, he is so assured thathis life is hid with Christ in God that he would willingly let the vampirefinish its meal in peace if he could thereby help it. In fact, the adept whoproposes to perform a magical absorption has to reach the point where he hasclearly realised the nothingness of the evil he proposes to absorb, and nolonger has any feeling towards it but pity for an ignorance that thinks it cangain any good thing for itself in this way. He desires to uplift and educate andfree the misguided soul from its bondage. Until he has arrived at the point whenhe has no other feeling than this towards his persecutor, it is not safe for himto attempt an absorption.Having satisfied himself that he is ready for the attempt, he proceeds to drawthe thought-form towards him by pulling in the silver cord that connects it withhis solar plexus if it be a vampiric thought-form, or by opening his aura to itand enfolding it if it be one of the other two types. He literally sucks it in.This process should be done slowly and gradually, taking some minutes in thedoing. If it be done suddenly, the adept may not find it possible to keep hisown vibrations steady, and then he will indeed be in an unpleasant situation.As the thought-form is absorbed, the adept will feel a reaction in his ownnature corresponding to the type of the thought-form. If it is a lust-force, hewill feel desire rise, within him; if it is a malicious force, he will feelanger; and if it is a vampire, he will feel blood-lust. He must immediatelyovercome this feeling and revert to his meditation upon the opposite quality,maintaining it until his vibrations are once more fully harmonised. He will thenknow that the evil force has been neutralised and there is much less evil in theworld. He will immediately feel a great access of vigour and a sense ofspiritual power, as if he could say to a mountain, “Be ye cast into the sea,”and it would be done. It is this sense of spiritual exaltation and power whichtells him that the work has been successfully accomplished. It is, however,advisable to repeat the meditation at intervals for two or three days in caseanother thought-form is formulated and sent after the first.As for the sender of the thought-form, when the absorption takes place he willfeel that “virtue has gone out of him,” and may even be reduced temporarily to astate of semi-collapse. He will soon revive, however, but with his power forevil of this particular type considerably reduced for some time to come; and ifhe have the possibility of reform in his nature, it may even be that he himselfwill be permanently freed from this type of evil.The great advantage of this method is that it actually destroys the evil, rootand branch; whereas the mere destruction of a thought-form is like cutting offthe top of a weed. On the other hand, it can only be done by an advancedoccultist keyed up to the highest pitch. If one is disturbed or harassed or hasin any degree lost his nerve, one dare not attempt it.If the rapport is perceived as a line of light, a cord, or any similar form,attached to the solar plexus, the forehead, or any other part of the body, thebest way of severing the rapport is to forge a magical weapon and cut it. Infact, if a rapport is felt, the first thing to do is to visualise the cord andtry to see where it attaches; the solar plexus is the commonest place.Next formulate the cross-handled sword as already described, and invoke God'sblessing upon it. Then visualise a flaming torch, and invoke the power of theHoly Ghost, whose symbol it is. Now with the sword hack through the cord or rayuntil every shred is severed. Then sear the stump with the consecrated fire ofthe torch until it shrivels up and falls off from its point of attachment toyour body.After such a severing one must, of course, take the ordinary human precautionsto prevent the link being re-formed. Refuse to meet the person responsible forits formulation, or to either read or answer letters from him. In fact, cut offphysical communications as thoroughly and resolutely as one has cut off astralones for a period of some months at least.There are occasions, however, when a person is so completely overshadowed anddominated that he cannot perform this operation for himself. The magicaloperation of Substitution can then be performed, if he can find a friend readyto undertake the task.In order to perform this operation, the two friends agree that it shall be done,but the one who is to become the substitute does not tell the original victimwhen he proposes to undertake the operation lest the latter should be socompletely in the hands of the dominator that he should give the game awayinvoluntarily.Choosing a time at which he is sure his friend is asleep, the substituteconcentrates upon him and imagines himself to be standing beside him, andvisualises the cord or ray of the rapport stretching from his friend out intospace. If he can visualise its other point of attachment in the dominator, somuch the better.He then formulates the sword and the torch as above described, and with these inhis hands he imagines himself stepping right through the line of rapport, so asto break it with his body. He must not use either sword or torch for thisprocess, but break it with his own flesh, as it were. Having thus severed itfrom his friend, he should then go for it with sword and torch with all hisstrength as it tries to enwrap him, as it assuredly will do, for it resemblesnothing so much as the tentacle of an octopus. He should go for it hammer andtongs, making up in zeal what he lacks in knowledge, until it has had enough,and begins to curl up and withdraw. The combat, of course, takes place in theimagination, but if a clear and vivid image is produced it will be effectual.In illustration of this method I may mention a case I once handled by its means.I was asked if I could help a woman who had been a lifelong invalid, but whosecase the many doctors she had consulted were neither able to diagnosesatisfactorily, nor to help. They all agreed that there was nothing organic thematter with her, and after trying in vain to get her better, they generallyunited in saying that it was pure hysteria. She suffered from a chroniccondition of exhaustion, indigestion, attacks of vomiting, blinding headache andpalpitation of the heart. She was, however, not in the least of a neuroticdisposition, but a quiet, sensible, intellectual woman, bearing her sufferingswith fortitude.I made a psychic diagnosis and came to the following conclusion. That for manypast lives she had been upon the Path, and that in her last life, a maleincarnation, in order to speed up her progress she had travelled in the East,and eventually took initiation into one of the Tibetan Orders, whichunfortunately turned out to be upon the Left-hand Path. Here she learnt theHatha Yoga which gives control over the functions of the body.In her present life, she retained the powers her training had given her, but notthe memory of its technique. Consequently her emotional states affected thoseautomatic systems of nervous control whose functions are normally not under thedirection of the mind. Whenever, therefore, she was emotionally disturbed, hersubconscious mentation overflowed into the automatic mind and threw certain ofthe functional systems of the body out of gear. It is my belief that thisexplanation affords a key to a good many cases of functional disorder. Manypeople in the course of occult meditative ptactices obtain control of theautomatic mind which controls the functioning of the bodily organs. It may berecalled that the famous scientist, Sir Francis Galton, the founder of thescience of eugenics, experimented with mental control of respiration, and havingobtained it, found that the automatic function had fallen into abeyance, and hehad to spend three anxious days breathing by will power and voluntary attentionuntil the automatic function was re-established.In this particular case, however, there was more than disturbance of function;there was this peculiar and very marked chronic exhaustion. I formed the opinionthat a rapport still existed between her and the Tibetan Order of which she hadbeen an initiate in her previous life. As is well known to occultists, onereturns life after life to the Order of which one is an initiate, the rapportbeing a very strong one. This is one of the reasons why the great MysterySchools have no need to make themselves known by advertising; they know theirown, and pick them up on the astral plane.But while it is an invaluable thing to be under the aegis of a reputable Order,it is an exceedingly unpleasant thing to stand in a similar relationship to adisreputable Order. In this particular case it was my opinion that the Order towhich this lady had belonged in her previous life had sunk to a very low ebbindeed, and its leaders were deliberately drawing upon the vitality of itsmembers.Acting upon this hypothesis, I projected myself astrally in the way I havealready described, and visited this lady at night. I perceived that from hersolar plexus as she lay asleep there stretched a black, elastic, stringy-lookingsubstance that resembled nothing so much as a stick of Spanish liquor ice thathas been well chewed by a small boy. This went off into space. Upon trying tosee its further end I had a brief and far-off vision of a monastery with aChinese type of roof perched on a crag among vast mountains.I tackled the situation by the simple expedient of passing in my astral bodyathwart the line of black substance, thus breaking it. It immediatelytransferred itself to my solar plexus, and for a moment I felt a surge oftempting thoughts urging me to get this woman under my thumb and exploit her toher full financial capacity. I cast these out, and “went for” the rope of astralliquorice in the manner I have described, casting it off and searing the stump,and had the satisfaction of seeing it curl up and disappear into the darkness. Ithen fell into what I considered a well-earned sleep.I had told this lady nothing of my ideas because I wanted to see whether I couldclear up the case by working solely on the occult hypothesis without anyadmixture of suggestion. Next morning I visited her to see how she was gettingon, and found her sitting up in bed eating a hearty breakfast and looking anentirely different woman to the grey-faced, exhausted creature I had seen theday before.Without waiting for any enquiry from me, she said, “I don't know what has beendone, but I feel as if something has been broken and I am free.”After breakfast she got up, went for a stroll, and met the doctor who wasattending her in the street. So great was the change in her appearance that hefailed to recognise her until she spoke to him.I told her that in my opinion she ought to have nothing whatever to do withoccult studies lest she re-form the magnetic link with her old Order, and alsotaught her how to prevent her subconscious mind from giving disruptivesuggestions to her bodily systems of functional control. For some years sheremained in good health, but later, unfortunately, took up the study ofoccultism again and relapsed into a condition approximating to her previous one,having presumably re-forged the contacts with the Tibetan Brotherhood which hadproved so disastrous to her."},{"pageContent":"> 20 METHODS OF DEFENCE: PART IV > Guardian angels Image [images/00004.jpg] National Heroes Image> [images/00004.jpg] The Good and Evil Angels of the Qabalah Image> [images/00004.jpg] The Higher self Image [images/00004.jpg] The Christ-force> Image [images/00004.jpg] The Occult Police Image [images/00004.jpg]> Experiences-in connection with the Occult Police Image [images/00004.jpg] The> Indian Adept and his meditation group Image [images/00004.jpg] How access was> gained to the group-mind of the British race Image [images/00004.jpg] How the> Occult Police were found Image [images/00004.jpg] Their methods Image> [images/00004.jpg] The sign they gave Image [images/00004.jpg] The fulfilling> of the sign Image [images/00004.jpg] Proof that they knew the adept's> movements Image [images/00004.jpg] The Hunting Lodges Image [images/00004.jpg]> Curious manner in which information is obtained Image [images/00004.jpg] How> the Occult Police can be contacted Image [images/00004.jpg] The occult lodges> have no central organisation Image [images/00004.jpg] The movement is not> controlled by Jews Image [images/00004.jpg] Groundless-ness of the charges> brought against the movement in this respect Image [images/00004.jpg] Chief> abuses of the occult movement Image [images/00004.jpg] Principal occultists> unknown outside their own lodges. THERE ARE SO many stories of the appearance of guardian angels at moments ofcrisis that even the most sceptical must admit that there is a case to beanswered.There is a tradition in Devon that if Drake's Drum, which is preserved atBuckland Abbey near Tavistock, is beaten in a time of crisis, Drake himself willreturn to lead the fleets of England. New bolt has immortalised this legend inhis famous poem:> “Take my drum to Devon, hang it by the shore. Beat it when your powder's> runnin' low. If the Dons sight Devon, I'll quit the port of Heaven, And drum> them up the Channel as we drummed them long ago.” The idea of the hero who returns to lead his people, the guardian angel thatappears in times of crisis, is sealed deep in the hearts of all nations, andnothing will eradicate it. Innumerable instances were reported by the menreturning from trenches during the War.Let us again refer to the ancient wisdom of the Qabalah, that storehouse ofoccult knowledge. We learn here of the Good Angel and the Evil Angel of the soulof man who stand behind his right and left shoulder, the one tempting him, andthe other inspiring him. Translate the Dark Angel into terms of modem thoughtand we have the Freudian subconsciousness.But the Freudians fail to realise that there is also a Bright Angel who standsbehind the tight shoulder of every man. This is the mystic super consciousnessor, in other words, the Higher Self, the Holy Guardian Angel whom Abramelinsought with such ardour and effort.We all know that, when caught off our guard, there comes a dark temptation fromthe depths of our lower selves, something atavistic stirs, and we thinkthoughts, or even do deeds of which we would never have believed ourselvescapable. We have heard the voice of the Dark Angel speaking.Equally in times of dire stress, when we have our backs to the wall and we arefighting for more than our physical lives, another voice makes itself heard, thevoice of the Bright Angel. I have never known this to occur when a man wasfighting simply for his physical life. To those who see beyond the veil, deathis no great evil; but in times of spiritual crisis, when the very self is beingswept away, then it is that the cry of the soul is heard, and Somethingmanifests out of the mists of the Unseen, manifests in a form that iscomprehensible to the one who calls. Whether intense stress induces a temporaryexpansion of consciousness, a fugitive psychism, or whether a Being of its ownvolition passes through the veil and manifests, I do not know; there are neverany details available of these incidents. They take place only in times of direstress and go as swiftly as they came, leaving no trace except upon the soul.I maintain that even as the Lower Self can rise up in moments of temptation, socan the Higher Self descend in moments of spiritual crisis. It is the aim of themystic to live exclusively in the Higher Self. It is the aim of the occultist tobring this Higher Self through into manifestation in brain consciousness; “In myflesh shall I see God.” Just as surely as the Lower Self can rise up and betrayus to some horrible deed, so can the Higher Self come to the rescue, “terribleas an army with banners.”I have already told of the mysterious voice which instructed me how to extricatemyself from grave psychic danger. Upon other occasions of stress and strain Ihave experienced a sudden expansion or shifting of the level of consciousness.The Higher Self has descended and taken control. From being in the midst ofturmoil one is suddenly raised high above it and sees all the circumstances ofone's life spread out like a bird's-eye view, as one might see the land from ahigh place, and one knows intuitively the outcome of the matter. All emotionalturmoil ceases, and one is like a ship hove-to, securely riding out the storm.When this occurs to me, the memory of my past incarnations is always vividlypresent also. It is this simultaneous wakening of the past which makes me feelthat the voice is that of my own Higher Self, and not of another entity.It is my belief that in times of spiritual crisis the man that has faith in thelaw of God can rise up and invoke its protection and a seeming miracle will beperformed for his benefit. Yet there can be no breach of natural law; thereforesuch a miracle must simply be an example of the working of a law with which weare as yet unfamiliar, just as an eclipse appears to the savage as a miracle,but to the astronomer as a natural phenomenon which he can forecast withaccuracy.What is it that induces this change of control in our lives? We are familiarwith the fact that the engine of a car has three speeds and a reverse. May itnot be that our minds are also geared, and that it is a changing of gears whichinduces psychism? Are there not times when we get into reverse and the ape andtiger within us take charge?Behind the physical plane lies the astral plane, and behind the astral planelies the mental plane, and behind the mental plane lies the spiritual plane,each plane acting as plane of causation to the one beneath it, and each in turnbeing controlled from the subtler plane above it. When we “change gear,”consciousness is shifted from a denser to a subtler plane and we begin to moveamong remoter and remoter causes of which the happenings upon the physical planeare the end-results; we manipulate these causes and the results are immediatelyeffected.When we change gear from the physical to the astral, we find ourselves upon theplane of psychic consciousness and the lesser magic. Supposing a psychic combatis taking place between two occultists, if one of them is of such a grade thathe can change gear again, so that consciousness is lifted from the astral to themental plane, he will be in the sphere of the greater magic and be in fullcontrol of the situation. The other can make no stand against him. But whathappens in the case of the rare and mystic soul who can shift consciousness onceagain and engage the gears of a purely spiritual power? He has outclassed theadept. There are many souls who have this mystical spiritual consciousnessalthough they have no occult knowledge. Between the higher and the lower modesof thought there is a great gulf fixed across which they leap precariously. Ifin a time of crisis they are able to rise up in faith and enter into thismystical consciousness and be still, they will have the upper air of anyoccultist who relies upon nothing save the technique of occultism.The question of mystical consciousness is, however, outside the scope of ourpresent enquiry, which is concern with psychic methods and the traditionaltechnique of the occultist. Different temperaments will employ differentmethods, and the mystical method does not appeal to everybody.The occultist does not ignore the Christ-force, however; he recognises it asamong the hierarchy of supreme forces of the universe, although he may not beprepared to assign to it the exclusive position which it occupies in the heartof the Christian mystic. In the Western Tradition it is symbolised by Tiphareth,the central Sephira of the Ten Holy Sephiroth of the Qabalistic Tree of Life.The Christ-force is the equilibrating, compensating, healing, redeeming,purifying factor of the universe. It should be invoked in every operation ofpsychic self-defence where any human element, incarnate or discarnate, isconcerned. Where non-human elements, such as elementáis, thought-forms, or theQliphoth, have to be dealt with, it is the power of God the Father, as Creatorof the universe, that is invoked, His supremacy over all the kingdoms of nature,visible and invisible, being affirmed. God the Holy Ghost is the force that isemployed in initiations, and it should not be invoked during times of psychicdifficulty, as its influence will tend to intensify the condition and render theVeil yet thinner.There is a very curious aspect of the occult field concerning which somethingmust be said in the present pages, though not a great deal can be revealed, and,to be frank, I do not know a great deal about it myself, but only such aspectsas I have actually come across. I have always heard it called the Occult Police;others may know it by different names but I believe it to be a very real andconcrete thing, though its organisation is not upon the physical plane, nor, sofar as I know, are its mundane activities gathered up into any single pair ofhands. I have crossed its trail upon a number of occasions, and played my partin its activities, and I have talked with others who have also been concerned init, and they have always said as I do, that it is the inner voice andcircumstances that direct our activities when we cooperate with this mysteriousorganisation.I think myself that it is organised in national units, for people seem to go inand out of jurisdictions, or to be passed on from one to another. In myexperience it has no particular political bias, but concerns itself solely withoccult methods applied to criminal ends and offences against society.One or two illustrative cases may help to make the matter clear. Somecomplications arose at one time over an Indian occultist who was visiting thiscountry in order to found a school. He was deeply involved in the politics ofhis own country, and there could be no doubt about it that he disliked theEnglish and all their ways very much indeed. I think that I was the onlypure-blooded Anglo-Saxon who was in touch with him. As far as I know, he did notconcern himself with mundane plane political activities, his idea being toorganise a meditation group which should pour the regenerative spiritual forceof the East into the group-soul of the British Empire, which he declared was ina very bad way indeed. I maintained, however, that the group-soul was not dying,as he held, but very tired, for it was immediately after the Great War.Moreover, I could not see how anybody who disliked it so very much was going tobe able to regenerate it. Nor was I sure that the regeneration was going to beto our taste if we were to get it. This man, whom I will call X., was of anintense spiritual pride, and his root-idea was that England must acknowledge thespiritual supremacy of India and take her spiritual inspiration from the East. Iwas young and inexperienced at the time, but I began to ask myself what mannerof spiritual force was going to be poured in through the channel we wereconstructing. Supposing during the Great War a group of English occultists hadtried to perform a similar service for Germany, what line would they have taken?Would they not have tried to influence the German group-mind to give up itsmilitarist ideals and concentrate on the League of Nations? Was it not more thanlikely that our Indian friend was trying to disabuse us of our Imperialistictendencies? Would it not appear to him, smarting as he was under the raceprejudice of the white man, that the world would be a much better place forhumanity if the English cultivated their own garden and let other people alone?I got more and more uneasy, and X., being a good psychic, detected myuneasiness, and I was asked to withdraw from the group he was organising.I felt quite convinced that something sinister was being attempted against thegroup-mind of my race, but I had no means of gauging its extent or potency. Thiswas not the kind of tale one could take to Scotland Yard; moreover, several ofmy personal friends believed in the bona fides of X. and were taking part in thegroup he was organising, and I was very anxious not to involve them in anyunpleasantness. In my perplexity I resolved to do nothing upon the physicalplane and to invoke the Masters upon the Inner Planes.At this time I was not of a grade which is supposed to have direct access to theMasters, but I determined to try and get them telepathically, though I did notknow whether those to whom I was trying to telepath were human or non-human,incarnate in physical bodies or discarnate entities, for at that time I was notvery advanced in my occult studies.All I had to hold on to was an abstract idea and the knowledge that in previousdifficulties I had been able to get in touch with Something on the Inner Planeswhich had proved a powerful friend.In telepathing, the usual method of getting in touch is to visualise the personyou want to communicate with and call him by name. I had nothing I couldvisualise and I knew no names. However, I determined to make the attempt as bestI might and, metaphorically speaking, I put my head out of the window of thisfleshly tabernacle and called for the police. And I got an answer. The InnerVoice replied to me very clearly and distinctly:“You are to go to Colonel Y.”I was taken aback at this, for Colonel Y. was a rather eminent person to whom Ihad once been introduced, and the last person in the world one would invite togo mare's-nesting. I had no desire to make myself ridiculous by bearding thisformidable warrior in his den. My psychological studies had made me familiarwith the workings of the subconscious mind and what it can do when dissociated,and I felt that the situation required handling with considerable cautionbecause the results of a mis-step might be unpleasant.I therefore replied to the Inner Voice, “I cannot trust you unless you will giveme a sign.”The reply came through, “Colonel Y. will be at your next lecture. Tell himthen.”To this I replied, “I know that Colonel Y. cannot be at my lecture because hisregiment is ordered abroad, and he will have left before it takes place.”The answer came back, “Colonel Y. will be at your next lecture.”“Very well,” I said, “that shall be my sign. If Colonel Y. is there, I will tellhim, and if not, I shall leave the affair to take its course.”The day duly arrived when I was to give a public lecture at a certain town. Iarrived at the hall in due course, and the first thing I saw was Colonel Y.going up the stairs! So I determined to take the bull by the horns, andimmediately after the lecture I went straight to him and said, “I have got amessage for you.”“I know you have,” he replied, “for I have been told to expect it.”It appears that he was sitting in his quarters one evening with his two dogs.They suddenly became disturbed and began to investigate something that wasn'tthere. He heard a voice saying distinctly to his inner ear that I should comeand ask his help and that he was to give it. He was so impressed by thisoccurrence that he went to a mutual friend and asked her whether I was introuble of any sort. At his request she wrote to me to enquire how I was faring,but mentioned no names, and I, not realising the significance of the incident,returned a non-committal answer.He heard my story and told me to leave the matter in his hands, which I did.This is a queer enough story of coincidence, but the sequel is even queerer.After leaving Colonel Y, I enquired once more of the Unseen whether I shouldtake any further steps. The reply came through that for the present I was to donothing, but that I would be told when further action was to be taken. I learntafterwards that X. had left the country a few days after my interview withColonel Y.Nothing happened for about five months, and then one evening when I was sittingover my fire in the dusk I distinctly heard the Inner Voice telling me that nowwas the time to make a move in the matter of X., and that I was to go to Mr. Z,and tell my story. Now Mr. Z. was a very eminent person indeed, whom I knew ofas being an advanced occultist, but whom I had never met. I replied to theinterior voice that for me to approach Mr. Z. was impossible, I should merely beshown the door, and that unless they could open up that way from their end, Idid not see how it was to be done. The answer came through very clearly that theway would be made plain. And it was.A couple of days later a visitor was announced, an old friend whom I only sawoccasionally, and after the usual greetings and exchange of news, he said, “Ishould very much like you to meet a friend of mine who I think would beinterested in your work. May I take you to see him? His name is Mr. Z.” Needlessto say I agreed.When I came to the appointed meeting, I said to Mr. Z., after I had beenintroduced, “I have got a message for you,” thinking I might as well be hung fora sheep as a lamb. He listened attentively, and when I mentioned the name of theIndian, my friend who was present, exclaimed, “It is a curious thing that youshould be moving in this matter at the present moment. X. landed in England acouple of days ago.”It will be noted that as soon as X. left England, I was instructed to hold myhand, and as soon as he returned after an absence of five months, I wasinstructed to commence action again. Unless we are prepared to pull the long armof coincidence clean out of its socket, we must conclude that some directingintelligence was at work. This is but one among many instances in my experience.Limitations of space forbid me to mention any more.In addition to the Occult Police, who function solely on the Inner Planes, therealso exist certain groups of occultists who have banded themselves together forthe purpose of combating Black Occultism. I suppose they give themselvesdifferent names, but I do not know what these are; I have always heard themreferred to generically as the Hunting Lodges. Upon various occasions I haveskirmished on their flanks and looked on at some lively forays. I imagine themto be organised in conjunction with the Occult Police, and they certainlypossess means of obtaining information which point to cooperation from the InnerPlanes. They appear to possess alliances in unexpected quarters and to be ableto pull a remarkable number of strings. What psychic weapons they use I do notknow, but upon the physical plane they appear to rely largely upon newspaperexposes, and upon keeping undesirables on the move, never allowing them tosettle down and organise. Knowing what I do of their methods, I have from timeto time recognised their sign-manual in various transactions for which decentcitizens have every reason to be grateful.I came across them in a manner which serves to illustrate the way in whichoccultists can “call” for information they may be in need of, and the fortuitoustrain of circumstances that will supply it.As a young girl, at the commencement of my interest in occultism, I came intouch with an adept whom I soon realised to be on the Left-hand Path, and withwhom I soon severed my connection. Shortly after I broke with him, I waswatching a gymkhana in company with some friends, among them a student ofoccultism, and we began to discuss matters of mutual interest. Impelled by Iknow not what impulse to confide in him what I had never told a soul, I told himof my experiences with the adept I have referred to. To my surprise he knew allabout him. It seems that my new acquaintance was connected with a group ofoccultists who had taken for their work the hunting out of Black Lodges; theyhad already crossed the trail of my black adept and had compelled him to closedown, and he had sworn not to reorganise his Order. They had had reason tobelieve recently that this oath was not being kept and that he had againorganised a Lodge and was working his rituals, but they did not know where tolay their hands on him. Then here came I, a bit of human flotsam tossed up on asports field to give them the information they needed at the very moment whenthey needed it. These things happen too regularly in occultism for one to beable to look upon them as chance.It is my belief that it is possible for anyone who has need of them to get intotouch telepathically with this occult police force. The symbol I was taught touse was a black Calvary Cross with circle on a scarlet ground. This is picturedin the imagination, and while gazing at it mentally the call is sent out intothe Unseen, projecting it from the centre of the forehead.Various attempts have been made to prove that the occult fraternities are alldirected from a single headquarters, said variously to be situated in Germany,Tibet, Mongolia and South America. Personally I do not believe it. I supposethat I have a pretty varied acquaintance with the inner workings of the occultmovement, and I have never seen anything whatever that indicated any centralisedconrrol, whether for good or for evil. Everything, in fact, points the otherway, and indicates that there is no connecting link save that of a commonliterature, a common idealism, and a set of symbols which, if not common to allsections, are readily translatable by means of well-understood equivalents. Theposition in the occult field is analogous to that of Protestant Christianity,not Roman Christianity. Occultism has no Pope.Nor do I think that Bolshevism ever gained any foothold in the Lodges, though Ibelieve it tried; as witness the application to my own fraternity. The averageoccultist is not interested in politics, his concern is with things invisible.Moreover, the occult fraternities are too uncoordinated and scattered to beformidable political weapons even if they were imbued with Bolshevism.It has also been said that the occult fraternities are controlled by the Jews inthe interests of Zionism. This is quite untrue. There are very few Jews in theoccult movement. It is true, however, that the Qabalah, the traditionalmysticism of the Jewish race, is one of the principal sources of Westernoccultism, and that any occultist working on that tradition must know at leastenough Hebrew to be able to transliterate Hebrew script. The study of the modernmystical Qabalah is almost exclusively in the hands of Gentiles, and orthodoxJewish scholars know little or nothing of its literature and nothing whatever ofits mystical significance.No one has said harder things of the occult movement than I have, and if Ithought that there were any organised system of evil influence, I should nothesitate to say so, for I have the integrity of the movement very much at heart;but I honestly do not believe that there is any generalised organisation of theoccult movement, whether for good or evil, whatever may be one's conception ofgood and evil.One can, of course, only speak of that which one has seen, but I think it wouldhave been impossible for me to have been as intimately associated with thatmovement as I have been and never to have crossed its trail at any point. I havecrossed so many trails, and seen, I will not deny it, so much that was evil, butthis particular evil I have not seen, and I do not believe it exists outside theimagination of people with bees in their bonnets. The true nexus of the occultmovement is devotion to a common ideal, but this ideal is approached by aninfinite diversity of paths, as many as the breaths of the sons of men.I am sorry for the hypothetical person who has the task of organising the occultmovement, for occultists of different schools cannot be induced to cooperate.Any technique which differs from that which they are used to is suspect; anyunfamiliar contact is black. The great majority of the heads of schools that Ihave known have sat each in his own circle of light and damned everybody else.Like the old lady who watched her son march past with the Territorials, theyexclaim, “They're all out of step except our Jock.” I had once dreamed of afederation of occult societies with an annual convention, but I soon realisedthat it was unworkable. If occultists cannot be got to organise to serve theirown interests, it is very unlikely that they would ever be got to organise toserve anybody else's.The most prevalent abuses of Western occultism are immorality, drug-taking andthe bamboozling of silly women. Its worst faults are credulity, a slipshodscholarship that verges on illiteracy, and a widespread sappiness of intellect.Fortune-telling in all its forms and some very spurious spiritual healingconstitute another slur upon what should be holy ground. It is difficult to dojustice to ideals which one does not share, but it has always seemed to me thatthe highly-coloured humanitarianism with which certain sections of the movementare soaked is not an ornament. “By their fruits ye shall know them.” Such fruitsof this as I have seen have appealed to me to be somewhat over-ripe.The finest minds in occultism are totally unknown outside their own Orders. Avery common clause in initiation oaths binds the candidate not to reveal thenames of his fellow-members. If this oath were broken, the general public wouldget some surprises. Occultism not being in good repute with the general public,men in public positions cannot afford to have their names associated with it;their interest is therefore carefully concealed, and they only speak of it tothose upon whose sympathy and discretion they can count.Those who know what to look for, however, can pick them out readily. Anyone whois accustomed to the analysis of literary style can detect the regular reader ofthe Bible. Anyone who knows the occult rituals will detect their flavour in theliterary or oratorical style of a man who is habituated to their use. Perhaps atthis length of time I may be forgiven if I break the Oath of the Mysteries thatbinds to secrecy concerning the names of initiates and suggest that the key tothe Bacon-Shakespeare controversy may lie in the fact that Bacon and Shakespearewere members of the same Order?"},{"pageContent":"> CONCLUSION > Difficulties of the task undertaken Image [images/00004.jpg] Charge of> reviving the superstitions of the Middle Ages Image [images/00004.jpg]> Abnormal psychic phenomena commonly met with in the witch-cult Image> [images/00004.jpg] Prevalence of Black Magic at the present day Image> [images/00004.jpg] Recommended books Image [images/00004.jpg] The phenomena of> the witch-cult and Black Magic should be studied in the light of psychology. IN THE PRECEDING pages I have endeavoured to discharge a difficult task, onethat is almost impossible to discharge satisfactorily. Limitations of spaceprevent me from explaining my concepts step by step and offering proofs thereof.To have done so would have required a library, not a book. I have had to presumein my readers not only an acquaintance with the literature of occultism but,what is much rarer, some experience of its practice. At the same time I haveendeavoured to offer sufficient explanation as I went along to make my pagescomprehensible to those whose, acquaintance with the subject is but cursory.This book is not, and cannot be, a satisfactory handbook for the treatment ofpsychic disorders. All it can do is to point in directions where enquiries mightbe pursued with advantage. If it serves to direct attention to certain subjectsthat badly need investigation it will have fulfilled its purpose.I may be charged with having revived the superstitions of the Middle Ages. Tothis charge I must plead guilty. But I must put forward as a counter-claim theplea that there could not be so much smoke without some fire, and that thesuperstitions of the Middle Ages may repay examination in the light of therecent discoveries concerning the psychology of subconsciousness.Whoever is familiar with the literature of psychic research, abnormalpsychology, and the baser aspects of that movement which took its rise from theinspiration of Christian Science and spread into a hundred uncontrolled cults,cannot fail to be struck by the fact that the old witch-finders were gettingexactly the same phenomena as we meet with in all these different movements andfields of thought.It has been said that since we find the stigmata of hysteria liberallydistributed among those unhappy beings charged with witchcraft that thewitch-cult is explained and disposed of. But we may find that a study of thereal motives underlying the witch-cult would throw light on hysteria and theallied mental states.It has also been said that history moves in cycles. At the present moment we areseeing a great revival of interest in psychic and occult subjects. We shall nothave to look very much further to find that there are also the very promisingbeginnings of a witch-cult in our midst.Let it be remembered that the cases I have quoted in these pages are from theexperience of a single person, and I am by no means exceptional in the range ofmy experience, though I may be less cautious than most in committing myself topaper. If one dip of the bucket reveals so much, what might not be brought up bysystematic dredging?Since my treatment of my subject must necessarily be cursory, I should like todirect the attention of my readers to certain books which throw a great deal oflight upon the question from various angles.Not only occultists, but psychologists, alienists and students of psychicmatters owe an immense debt of gratitude to the scholarship of the Rev. MontagueSummers and the enterprise of Messrs. Rodker for making available exact andcomplete translations of the principal books upon witchcraft that were writtenby the men who were actually concerned in stamping out the witch-cult and hadfirst-hand knowledge of its nature."},{"pageContent":"> BIBLIOGRAPHY IN ADDITION TO these I would direct my readers' attention to The Projection ofthe Astral Body (Weiser, 1968), by Muldoon and Carrington, which throws a veryinteresting light upon the manner in which genuine witches attended the Sabbats.I do not mean by these words to imply that Mr. Muldoon is addicted to wizardry,but he certainly possesses the traditional powers, and if he can do these thingsat the present day, why could not the witches have done them in days past ? Atany rate, I do not think there is much doubt that the Holy Inquisition wouldhave paid him the compliment of burning him if he had lived during its hey-day.Thirty Years Among the Dead (Health Research, 1996), by Dr. Wickland, is anotherbook which gives chapter and verse for personal experience instead of citingauthorities and theorising about them. It is the record of an asylum doctorwhose wife is a trance medium, and who made a most remarkable series ofinvestigations concerning the nature of obsessing entities.In Dr. Moll's book, Hypnotism (Da Capo, 1982), some remarkable phenomena arerecorded such as do not find their way into modern books, whether because theinvestigators are less expert at eliciting them, or more cautious incommunicating them, having profited by the experience of the earlierinvestigators. Some of the earlier books on hypnosis and mesmerism yield somevery interesting reading to the psychic investigator.Dr. T. W. Mitchell's Medical Psychology and Psychical Research (Methuen, 1922)is another book of value to the student, who should be familiar not only withthe signs of psychic attack, but also with the signs of pseudo-attack in orderthat he may distinguish between them and not be misled into some veryuncomfortable errors. To find one has been successfully hoaxed by a lunatic is ahumiliating experience.Myers' Human Personality (Ayer, 1975) is of course a classic with which everystudent of psychic phenomena ought to be familiar. There is an excellentabridged edition available for those who do not feel equal to coping with thetwo massive volumes of its original form.Nicoll's Dream Psychology (Weiser, 1979) and Harr's Psychology of Insanity(Cambridge University Press, 1923) are two exceedingly illuminating littlebooks, both written for the layman and readily comprehensible by him. They throwa great deal of light upon the mechanisms of the mind, and no one should attemptto deal with a psychic attack unless he understands those mechanisms. My ownlittle book, Machinery of the Mind (Weiser, 1980), written under my maiden nameof Violet M. Firth, will, I think, be found a useful general introduction tomodern psychology.Let us approach the subject of modern witchcraft neither in a spirit ofincredulity nor of superstition, but from the standpoint of the psychologist,seeking to understand the workings of the mind and prepared to discover muchthat had hitherto passed unsuspected."},{"pageContent":"> INDEX A Abramelin, 61
