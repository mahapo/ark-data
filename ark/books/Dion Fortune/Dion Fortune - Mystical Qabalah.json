In thesepages I have availed myself of the alphabetical table given by MacGregor Mathersin The Kabba/ah Unveiled because this book is the one generally used by esotericstudents. He himself does not adhere to his own table systematically, however,and even uses different spellings for the same words. This is very confusing foranyone who wishes to use the Gematric method of elucidation, in which lettersare turned into numbers. When, therefore, Mathers gives alternative transliterations, I have followed the one which coincides with that given in his owntable.The capitalisation employed in these pages may also appear unusual, but it isthe one traditionally used among students of the Western Esoteric Tradition. Inthis system, common words, such as earth or path, are used in a technical senseto denote spiritual principles. When this is done, a capital is used to indicatethe fact. When a capital is not used, it may be taken that the word is to beunderstood in its ordinary sense.As I have frequently referred to the authority of MacGregor Mathers and AleistetCrowley in matters of Qabalistic mysticticism, it may be as well to explain myposition in relation to these two writers.[Page VI]I was at one time a member of the organisation founded by the former, but havenever been associated with the latter. I have never known either of thesegentlemen personally, MacGregor Mathers having died before I joined hisorganisation, and Aleister Crowley having then ceased to be associated with it.The Society of the Inner Light, founded by the late Dion Fortune, has coursesfor those who wish seriously to pursue the study of the Western EsotericTradition.

The Tree of Life and the Thirty-two PathsPART ICHAPTER ITHE YOGA OF THE WEST1. Very few students of occultism know anything at all about the fountain-headwhence their tradition springs. Many of them do not even know there is a WesternTradition.Scholarship is baffled by the intentional blinds and defences with whichinitiates both ancient and modern have wrapped themselves about, and concludesthat the few fragments of a literature which have come down to us are medievalforgeries. They would be greatly surprised if they knew that these fragments,supplemented by manuscripts that have never been allowed to pass out of thehands of initiates, and completed by an oral tradition, are handed down inschools of initiation to this day, and are used as the bases of the practicalwork of the Yoga of the West.2. The adepts of those races whose evolutionary destiny is to conquer thephysical plane have evolved a Yoga technique of their own which is adapted totheir special problems and peculiar needs. This technique is based upon thewell-known but little understood Qabalah, the Wisdom of Israel.3. It may be asked why it is that the Western nations should go to the Hebrewculture for their mystical tradition ? The answer to this question will bereadily understood by those who are acquainted with the esoteric theoryconcerning races and sub-races. Everything must have a source. Cultures do notspring out of nothing. The seed-bearers of each new phase of culture must ofnecessity arise within the preceding Culture. No one can deny that Judaism wasthe matrix of the[Page 2]European spiritual culture when they recall the fact that Jesus and Paul wereboth Jews.No race except the Jewish race could possibly have served as the stock uponwhich the new dispensation was to be grafted because no other race wasmonotheistic. Pantheism and polytheism had had their day and a new and morespiritual culture was due. The Mystical Qabala Page 5Christian races owe their religion to the Jewish culture as surely as theBuddhist races of the East owe theirs to the Hindu culture.4. The mysticism of Israel supplies the foundation of modern Western occultism.It forms the theoretical basis upon which all ceremonial is developed. Itsfamous glyph, the Tree of Life, is the best meditation-symbol we possess becauseit is the most comprehensive.5. It is not my intention to write a historical study of the sources of theQabalah, but rather to show the uses that are made of it by modern students ofthe Mysteries. For although the roots of our system are in tradition, there isno reason why we should be hidebound by tradition. A technique that is beingactually practised is a growing thing, for the experience of each workerenriches it and becomes part of the common heritage.6. It is not necessarily incumbent upon us to do certain things or hold certainideas because the Rabbis who lived before Christ had certain views. The worldhas moved on since those days and we are under a new dispensation but what wastrue in principle then will be true in principle now, and of value to us. Themodern Qabalist is the heir of the ancient Qabalist, but he must re-interpretdoctrine and re-formulate method in the light of the present dispensation if theheritage he has received is to be of any practical value to him.7. I do not clairn that the modern Qabalistic teachings as I have learnt themare identical with those of the pre-Christian Rabbis, but I claim that they arethe legitimate descendants thereof and the natural development therefrom.8. The nearer the source the purer the stream. In order to discover firstprinciples we must go to the fountain-head. But a river receives manytributaries in the course of its flow, and these need not necessarily bepolluted. If we want to discover whether they are pure or not, we compare themwith the pristine stream, and if they pass this test they may well be permittedto mingle with the main body of waters and swell their strength. So it is with atradition: that which is not antagonistic will be assimilated. We must alwaystest the purity of a tradition by reference to first principles, but we shallequally judge of the vitality of a tradition by its power to assimilate. It isonly a dead faith which remains uninfluenced by contemporary thought.9. The original stream of Hebraic mysticism has received many tributaries. Wesee its rise among the nomad star-worshippers of Chaldea, where Abraham in histent among his flocks hears the voice of God. But Abraham has a shadowybackground in which vast forms move half-seen. The mysterious figure of a greatPriest-king, \"born without father, without mother, without descent; havingneither beginning of days nor end of life,\"administers to him the first Eucharistic feast of bread and wine after thebattle with the Kings in the valley, the sinister Kings of Edom, \"who ruled erethere was a king in Israel, whose kingdoms are unbalanced force.\"10. Generation by generation we trace the intercourse of the princes of Israelwith the priest-kings of Egypt. Abraham and Jacob went thither; Joseph and Moseswere Mystical Qabala Page 6intimately associated with the court of the royal adepts. When we read ofSolomon sending to Hiram, King of Tyre, for men materials to aid in the buildingof the Temple we know that the famous Tyrian Mysteries must have profoundlyinfluenced the Hebrew esotericism. When we read of Daniel being educated in thepalaces of Babylon we know that the wisdom of the Magi must have been accessibleto Hebrew illuminati.11. This ancient mystical tradition of the Hebrews possessed three literatures:the Books of the Law and the Prophets, which are known to us as the OldTestament; the Talmud, or[Page 4]collection of learned commentaries thereon; and the Qabalah, or mysticalinterpretation thereof. Of these three the ancient Rabbis say that the first isthe body of the tradition, the second its rational soul, and the third itsimmortal spirit. Ignorant men may with profit read the first; learned men studythe second; but the wise meditate upon the third. It is a strange thing thatChristian exegesis has never sought the keys to the Old Testament in theQabalah.12. In Our Lord's day there were three schools of religious thought inPalestine: the Pharisees and the Sadducees, of whom we read so frequently in theGospels; and the Essenes, who are never referred to. Esoteric tradition aversthat the boy Jesus ben Joseph, when His calibre was recognised by the learneddoctors of the Law who heard Him speak in the Temple at the age of twelve, wassent by them to the Essenian community near the Dead Sea to be trained in themystical tradition of Israel, and that He remained there until He came to Johnto be baptised in the Jordan before commencing His mission at the age of thirty.Be that as it may, the closing clause of the Lord's Prayer is pure Qabalism.Malkuth, the Kingdom, Hod, the Power, Netzach, the Glory, form the basaltriangle of the Tree of Life, with Yesod, the Foundation, or Receptacle ofInfluences, as the central point. Whoever formulated that prayer knew hisQabalah.13. Christianity had its esotericism in the Gnosis, which owed much to bothGreek and Egyptian thought. In the system of Pythagoras we see an adaptation ofthe Qabalistic principles to Greek mysticism.14. The exoteric, state-organised section of the Christian Church persecuted andstamped out the esoteric section, destroying every trace of its literature uponwhich it could lay hands in striving to eradicate the very memory of a gnosisfrom human history. It is recorded that the baths and bakehouses of Alexandriawere fired for six months with the manuscripts from the great library. Verylittle remains to us of our spiritual heritage in the ancient wisdom. Everythingthat was above ground was swept away, and it is uniy with the excavation ofancient monuments the sands have swallowed that we are beginning to rediscoverits fragments.15. It was not until the fifteenth century, when the power of the Church wasbeginning to show signs of weakening, that men dared to commit to paper thetraditional Wisdom of Israel. Scholars declare that the Qabalah is a medievalforgery because they cannot trace Mystical Qabala Page 7a succession of early manuscripts, but those who know the manner of working ofesoteric fraternities know that a whole cosmogony and psychology can be conveyedin a glyph which means nothing to the uninitiated. These strange old chartscould be handed on from generation to generation, their explanation beingcommunicated verbally, and the true interpretation would never be lost. When indoubt as to the explanation of some abstruse point, reference would be made tothe sacred glyph, and meditation thereon would unfold what generations ofmeditation had ensouled therein. It is well known to mystics that if a manmeditates upon a symbol around which certain ideas have been associated by pastmeditation, he will obtain access to those ideas, even if the glyph has neverbeen elucidated to him by those who have received the oral tradition \"by mouthto ear.\"16. The organised temporal force of the Church availed to drive all rivals fromthe field and destroy their traces. We little know what seeds of mysticaltradition sprang up only to be cut down during the Dark Ages; but mysticism isinherent in the human race, and although the Church had destroyed all roots oftradition in her group-soul, nevertheless devout spirits within her foldrediscovered the technique of the soul's approach to God and developed acharacteristic Yoga of their own, closely akin to the Bhakti Yoga of the East.The literature of Catholicism is rich in treatises on mystical theology whichreveal practical acquaintance with the higher states of consciousness though asomewhat naive conception of the psychology thereof, thus revealing the povertyof a system which does not avail itself of the experience of tradition.17. The Bhakti Yoga of the Catholic Church is only Suitable for those whosetemperament is naturally devotional[Page 6]and who find their readiest expression in loving self-sacrifice. But it is noteverybody who is of this type, and Christianity is unfortunate in not having anychoice of systems to offer its aspirants. The East, being tolerant, is wise, andhas developed various Yoga methods, each of which is pursued by its adherents tothe exclusion of the others, and yet none would deny that the other methods arealso paths to God for those to whom they are suited.18. In consequence of this deplorable limitation on the part of our theologymany Western aspirants take up Eastern methods. For those who are able to livein Eastern conditions and work under the immediate supervision of a guru, thismay prove satisfactory, but it seldom gives good results when the varioussystems are pursued with no other guide than a book and under unmodified Westernconditions.19. It is for this reason that I would recommend to the white races thetraditional Western system, which is admirably adapted to their psychicconstitution. It gives immediate results, and if done under proper supervision,not only does it not disturb the mental or physical equipoise, as happens withregrettable frequency when unsuitable systems are used, but it produces a uniquevitality. It is this peculiar vitality of the adepts which led to MysticalQabala Page 8the tradition of the elixir of life. I have known a number of people in my timewho might justly be considered adepts, and I have always been struck by thatpeculiar ageless vitality they all possessed.20. On the other hand, however, I can only endorse what all the gurus of theEastern Tradition have always averred-that any system of psycho-spiritualdevelopment can only be safely and adequately carried on under the personalsupervision of an experienced teacher. For this reason, although I shall give inthese pages the principles of the mystical Qabalah, I do not consider it wouldbe in anybody's interest to give the keys to its practice even if by the termsof the obligation of my own initiation I were not forbidden to do so. But, onthe other hand, I do not consider it fair to the reader to introduce intentionalblinds and misinformation, and to the best of my knowledge and belief theinformation I give is accurate, even if incomplete.21. The Thirty-two Mystical Paths of the Concealed Glory are ways of life, andthose who want to unravel their secrets must tread them. As I myself wastrained, so can anyone be trained who is willing to undergo the discipline, andI will gladly indicate the way to any earnest seeker.[Page 8]CHAPTER IITHE CHOICE OF A PATH1. No student will ever make any progress in spiritual development who flitsfrom system to sytsem; first using some New Thought affirmations, then some Yogabreathing exercises and meditation-postures, and following these by an attemptat the mystical methods of prayer. Each of these systems has its value, but thatvalue can only be realised if the system is carried out in its entirety. Theyare the calisthenics of consciousness, and aim at gradually developing thepowers of the mind. The value does not lie in the prescribed exercises as endsin themselves, but in the powers that will be developed if they are perseveredwith. If we intend to take our occult studies seriously and make of themanything more than desultory light reading, we must choose our system and carryit out faithfully until we arrive, if not at its ultimate goal, at any rate atdefinite practical results and a permanent enhancement of consciousness. Afterthis has been achieved we may, not without advantage, experiment with themethods that have been developed upon other Paths, and build up an eclectictechnique and philosophy therefrom; but the student who sets out to be aneclectic before he has made himself an expert will never be anything more than adabbler.2. Whoever has any practical experience of the different methods of spiritualdevelopment knows that the method must fit the temperament, and that it mustalso be adapted to the grade of development of the student. Westerners,especially such as prefer Mystical Qabala Page 9the occult to the mystic Path, often come seeking initiation at a stage ofspiritual development which an Eastern guru would consider exceedingly immature.Any method that is to be available for the West must have in its lower grades atechnique which can be used as a stepping-stone by these undeveloped students;to ask them to rise immediately to metaphysical heights is useless in the caseof the great majority) and prevents a start from being made.3. For a system of spiritual development to be applicable in the West it mustfulfil certain well-defined requirements. To begin with, its elementarytechnique must be such that it is readily grasped by minds that have in themnothing of the mystic. Secondly, the forces it brings to bear to stimulate thedevelopment of the higher aspects of consciousness must be sufficiently powerfuland concentrated to penetrate the relatively dense vehicles of the averageWesterner, who makes nothing whatever of subtle vibrations. Thirdly, as fewEuropeans, following a racial dharma of material development, have either theopportunity or the inclination to lead the life of a recluse, the forcesemployed must be handled in such a way that they can be made available duringthe brief periods that the modern man or woman can, at the commencement of thePath, snatch from their daily avocations to give to the pursuit. They must, thatis to say, be handled by a technique which enables them to be readilyconcentrated and equally readily dispersed, because it is not possible tomaintain these high psychic tensions while living the hard-driving life of thecitizen of a European city. Experience proves with unfailing regularity that themethods of psychic development which are effectual and satisfactory for therecluse produce neurotic conditions and breakdowns in the person who pursuesthem while compelled to endure the strain of modern life.4. So much the worse for modern life, some may say, and adduce this undeniablefact as an argument for modifying Our Western ways of living. Far be it from meto maintain that our civilisation is perfect, or that wisdom originated and willdie with us, but it appears to me that if our karma (or destiny) has caused usto be incarnated in a body of a certain racial type and temperament, it may beconcluded that that is[Page 10]the discipline and experience which the Lords of Karma consider we need in thisincarnation, and that we shall not advance the cause of our evolution byavoiding or evading it. I have seen so many attempts at spiritual developmentthat were simply evasions of life's problems that I am suspicious of any systemwhich involves a breach with the group-soul of the race. Nor am I impressed by adedication to the higher life which manifests itself by peculiarities ofclothing and bearing and by the manner of cutting, or omitting to cut, the hair.True spirituality never advertises itselŁ5. The racial dharma of the West is the conquest of dense matter. If this wererealised it would explain many problems in the relationships of West and East.In order that we may conquer dense matter and develop the concrete mind we areendowed by our racial heritage with a particular type of physical body andnervous system, just as other races, such as the Mongolian and the Negro, areendowed with other types.Mystical Qabala Page 106. It is injudicious to apply to one type of psycho-physical make-up thedeveloping methods adapted to another; they will either fail to produce adequateresults, or produce unforeseen and possibly undesirable results. To say this isnot to condemn the Eastern methods, nor decry the Western constitution, which isas God made it, but to reaffirm the old adage that one man's meat is anotherman's poison.7. The dharma of the West differs from that of the East; is it thereforedesirable to try and implant Eastern ideals in a Westerner? Withdrawal from theearth-plane is not his line of progress. The normal, healthy Westerner has nodesire to escape from life, his urge is to conquer it and reduce it to order andharmony. It is only the pathological types who long to \"cease upon the midnightwith no pain,\" to be free from the wheel of birth and death; the normal Westerntemperament demands \"life, more life.\"8. It is this concentration of life-force that the Western occultist seeks inhis operations.He does not try to escape from matter into spirit, leaving an unconqueredcountry behind him to get on as best it may; he wants to bring the Godhead downinto manhood and make Divine Law prevail even in the Kingdom of the Shades. Thisis the root-motive for the acquisition of occult powers upon the Right-handPath, and explains why initiates do not abandon all for the mystic Divine Union,but cultivate a White Magic.9. It is this White Magic, which consists in the application of occult powers tospiritual ends, by means of which a large proportion of the training anddevelopment of the Western aspirant is carried out. I have seen something of agood many different systems, and in my opinion the person who tries to dispensewith ceremonial is working at a great disadvantage. Development by meditationalone is a slow process in the West, because the mind-stuff upon which it has towork, and the mental atmosphere in which the work has to be done, are veryresistant. The only purely meditative school of Western Yoga is that of theQuakers, and I think that they would agree that their path is for the few; theCatholic Church combines Mantra Yoga with its Bhakti Yoga.10. It is by means of formula that the occultist selects and concentrates theforces he wishes to work with. These formule are based upon the Qabalistic Treeof Life, and whatever system he may be working, whether he be assuming theGod-forms of Egypt or evoking the inspiration of Iacchus with chant and dance,he has the diagram of the Tree at the back of his mind. It is in the symbolismof the Tree that Western initiates are drilled, and it supplies the essentialground~plan of classification to which all other systems can be related. The Rayupon which the Western aspirant works has manifested itself-through manydifferent cultures and developed a characteristic technique in each. The moderninitiate works a synthetic system, sometimes using an Egyptian, a Greek, or evena Druidic method, for different methods are best suited for different purposesand conditions. In all cases, however, the operation he designs is strictlyrelated to the Paths of the Tree of which he is master. If he possesses thegrade which corresponds to the Sephirah Netzach, he can work with themanifestation of the force of that aspect of the[Page 12]Mystical Qabala Page 11Godhead (distinguished by the Qabalists by the name of Tetragrammaton Elohim) inwhatever system he may select. In the Egyptian system it will be the Isis ofNature; in the Greek, Aphrodite; in the Nordic, Freya; in the Druidic, Keridwen.In other words, he possesses the powers of the Sphere of Venus in whatevertraditional system he may be using. Having attained a grade in one system, hehas access to the equivalent grades of all the other systems of his Tradition.11. But although he may use these other systems as occasion serves, experienceproves that the Qabalah supplies the best groundwork and the best system uponwhich to train a student before he begins to experiment with the pagan systems.rhe Qabalah is essentially monotheistic; the potencies it classifies are alwaysregarded as the messengers of God and not His fellow-workers. This principleenforces the concept of a centralised government of the Cosmos and of the gripof the Divine Law upon the whole of manifestation-a very necessary principlewith which to imbue any student of the Arcane forces. It is the purity, sanity,and clarity of the Qabalistic concepts as resumed in the formula of the Tree ofLife which makes that glyph such an admirable one for the meditations that exaltconsciousness and justify us in calling the Qabalah the Yoga of the West.CHAPTER IIITHE METHOD OF THE QABALAH1. Speaking of the method of the Qabalah, one of the ancient Rabbis says that anangel coming down to earth would have to take on human form in order to conversewith men.The curious symbol-system known to us as the Tree of Life is an attempt toreduce to diagrammatic form every force and factor in the manifested universeand the soul of man; to correlate them one to another and reveal them spread outas on a map so that the relative positions of each unit can be seen and therelations between them traced. In brief, the Tree of Life is a compendium ofscience, psychology, philosophy, and theology.2. The student of the Qabalah goes to work in exactly the opposite way to thestudent of natural science; the latter builds up synthetic concepts; the formeranalyses abstract concepts. It goes without saying, however, that before aconcept can be analysed it must first be assembled. Someone must have thoughtout the principles that are resumed in the symbol which is the object ofmeditation of the Qabalist. Who then were the first Qabalists who built up thewhole scheme? The Rabbis are unanimdus upon this point, they were angels. Inother words, it was beings of another order of creation than humanity who gavethe Chosen People their Qabalah.3. To the modern mind this may seem as absurd a statement as the doctrine thatbabies are found under gooseberry bushes; but if we study the many mysticalsystems of Mystical Qabala Page 12comparative religion we find that all the illuminati are in agreement upon thispoint. All men and women who have had practical experience of the spiritual lifetell us that they are taught by[Page 14]Divine beings. We shall be very foolish if we altogether disregard such a cloudof witnesses, especially those of us who never have had any personal experienceof the higher states of consciousness.4. There are some psychologists who will tell us that the Angels of theQabalists and the Gods and Manus of other systems are our own repressedcomplexes; there are others with less limited outlook who will tell us thatthese Divine beings are the latent capacities of our own higher selves. To thedevotional mystic this is not a point of any great moment; he gets his results,and that is all he cares about; but the philosophical mystic, in other words theoccultist, thinks the matter out and arrives at certain conclusions. Theseconclusions, however, can only be understood when we know what we mean byreality and have a clear line of demarcation between the subjective and theobjective. Any one who is trained in philosophical method knows that this isasking a good deal.5. The Indian schools of metaphysics have most elaborate and intricate systemsof philosophy which attempt to define these ideas and render them thinkable; andthough generations ef seers have given their lives to the task, the conceptsstill remain so abstract that it is only after a long course of discipline,called Yoga in the East, that the mind is able to apprehend them at all.6. The Qabalist goes to work in a different way. He does not attempt to make themind rise up on the wings of metaphysics into the rarefied air of abstractreality; he formulates a concrete symbol that the eye can see, and lets itrepresent the abstract reality that no untrained human mind can grasp.7. It is exactly the same principle as algebra. Let X represent the unknownquantity, let Yrepresent the half of X, and let Z represent something we know. If we begin toexperiment with Y; to find out its relation to Z, and in what proportions, itsoon ceases to be entirely unknown; we have learnt something at any rate aboutit; and if we are sufficiently skilful we may in the end be able to express Y interms of Z, and then we shall begin to understand X.8. There are a great many symbols which are used as objects of meditation; theCross in Christendom; the God-forms in the Egyptian system; phallic symbols inother faiths.These symbols are used by the uninitiated as a means of concentratmg the mindand introducing into it certain thoughts, calling up certain associated ideas,and stimulating certain feelings. The initiate, however, uses a symbol-systemdifferently; he uses it as an algebra by means of which he will read the secretsof unknown potencies; in other words, he uses the symbol as a means of guidingthought out into the Unseen and Incomprehensible.Mystical Qabala Page 139. And how does he do this? He does it by using a composite symbol; a symbolwhich is an unattached unit would not serve his purpose. In contemplating such acomposite symbol as the Tree of Life he observes that there are definiterelations between its parts.There are some parts of which he knows something; there are others of which hecan intuit something, or, more crudely, make a guess, reasoning from firstprinciples. The mind leaps from one known to another known and in so doingtraverses certain distances, metaphorically speaking; it is like a traveller inthe desert who knows the situation of two oases and makes a forced march betweenthem. He would never have dared to push out into the desert from the first oasisif he had not known the location of the second; but at the end of his journey henot only knows much more about the characteristics of the second oasis, but hehas also observed the country lying between them. Thus, making forced marchesfrom oasis to oasis, backwards and forwards across the desert, he graduallyexplores it; nevertheless, the desert is incapable of supporting life.10. So it is with the Qabalistic system of notation. The things it renders areunthinkable-and yet the mind, tracking from symbol to symbol, manages to thinkabout them; and although we have to be content to see in a glass darkly, yet wehave every reason to hope that ultimately we shall see face to[Page 16]face and know even as we are known; for the human mind grows by exercise, andthat which was at first as unthinkable as mathematics to the child who cannotmanage his sums, finally comes within the range of our realisation. By thinkingabout a thing, we build concepts of it.11. It is said that thought grew out of language, not language out of thought.What words are to thought, symbols are to intuition. Curious as it may seem, thesymbol precedes the elucidation; that is why we declare that the Qabalah is agrowing system, not a historic monument. There is more to be got out of theQabalistic symbols to-day than there was in the time of the old dispensationbecause our mental content is richer in ideas. How much more, for instance, doesthe Sephirah Yesod, wherein work the forces of growth and reproduction, mean tothe biologist than to the ancient rabbi? Everything that has to do with growthand reproduction is resumed in the Sphere of the Moon. But this Sphere, asrepresented upon the Tree of Life, is set about with Paths leading to otherSephiroth; therefore the biological Qabalist knows that there must be certaindefinite relationships between the forces subsumed in Yesod and thoserepresented by the symbols assigned to these Paths. Brooding over these symbols,he gets glimpses of relationships that do not reveal themselves when thematerial aspect of things is considered; and when he comes to work these out inthe material of his studies he finds that therein are hidden important clues;and so upon the Tree, one thing leads to another, explanation of hidden causesarising out of the proportions and relations of the various individual symbolscomposing this mighty synthetic glyph.12. Each symbol, moreover, admits of interpretation upon the different planes,and through its astrological associations can be related to the gods of anypantheon, thus Mystical Qabala Page 14opening up vast new fields of implication in which the mind ranges endlessly,symbol leading on to symbol in an unbroken chain of associations; symbolconfirming symbol as the many-branching threads gather themselves together intoa synthetic glyph once more, and each symbol capable of interpretation in termsof whatever plane the mind may be functioning upon.13. This mighty, all-embracing glyph of the soul of man and of the universe, byvirtue of its logical association of symbols, evokes images in the mind; butthese images are not randomly evolved, but follow along well-definedassociation-tracks in the Universal Mind. The symbol of the Tree is to theUniversal Mind what the dream is to - the individual ego - it is a glyphsynthetised from subconsciousness to represent the hidden forces.14. The universe is really a thought-form projected from the mind of God. TheQabalistic Tree might be likened to a dream-picture arising from thesubconsciousness of God and dramatising the subconscious content of Deity. Inother words, if the universe is the conscious end-product of the mental activityof the Logos, the Tree is the symbolic representation of the raw material of theDivine consciousness and of the processes whereby the universe came into being.15. But the Tree applies not only to the Macrocosm but to the Microcosm which,as all occultists realise, is a replica in miniature. It is for this reason thatdivination is possible.That little-understood and much-maligned art has for its philosophical basis theSystem of Correspondences represented by symbols. The correspondences betweenthe soul of man and the universe are not arbitrary, but arise out ofdevelopmental identities. Certain aspects of consciousness were developed inresponse to certain phases of evolution, and therefore embody the sameprinciples; consequently they react to the same influences. A man's soul is likea lagoon connected with the sea by a submerged channel; although to all outwardseeming it is land-locked, nevertheless its waterAevel rises and falls with thetides of the sea because of the hidden connection. So it is with humanconsciousness, there is a subconscious connection between each individual souland the World-soul deep hidden in the most primitive depths of subconsciousness,and in consequence we share in the rise and fall of the cosmic tides.16. Each symbol upon the Tree represents a cosmic force or factor. When the mindconcentrates upon it, it comes into touch with that force; in other words, aŁurface channel, a channel in consciousness, has been made between the consciousmind of the individual and a particular factor in the world-soul, and throughthis channel the waters of the ocean pour into the lagoon. The aspirant who usesthe Tree as his meditation-symbol establishes point by point the union betweenhis soul and the world-soul. This results in a tremendous access of energy tothe individual soul; it is this which endows it with magical powers.17. But just as the universe must be ruled by God, so must the many-sided soulof man be ruled by its god-the spirit of man. The Higher Self must dominate itsuniverse or there will be unbalanced force; each factor will rule its ownaspect, and they will war among Mystical Qabala Page 15themselves. Then do we have the rule of the Kings of Edom, whose kingdoms areunbalanced force.18. Thus do we see in the Tree a glyph of the soul of man and the universe, andin the legends associated with it the history of the evolution of the soul andthe Way of Initiation.CHAPTER IVTHE UNWRITTEN QABALAH1. The point of view from which I approach the Holy Qabalah in these pagesdiffers, so far as I know, from that of all other writers on the subject, for tome it is a living system of spiritual development, not a historical curiosity.Few people, even among those interested in occultism, realise that there is anactive Esoteric Tradition in our midst, handed down in private manuscripts andby \"mouth to ear.\" Still fewer know that it is the Holy Qabalah, the mysticsystem of Israel, which forms its basis. But where may we look more aptly forour occult inspiration than to the Tradition which gave us the Christ?2. The interpretation of the Qabalah is not to be found, however, among theRabbis of the Outer Israel, who are Hebrews after the flesh, but among those whoare the Chosen People after the spirit-in other words, the initiates. Neither isthe Qabalah, as I have learnt it, a purely Hebraic system, for it has beensupplemented during medieval times by much alchemical lore and by the intimateassociation with it of that most marvellous system of symbolism, the Tarot.3. In my presentation of the subject, therefore, I do not appeal so much totradition in support of my views, as to modern practice among those who make useof the Qabalah as their method of occult technique. It may be 'alleged againstme that the ancient Rabbis knew nothing of some of the concepts here set forth;to this I reply that it is hardly to be expected that they should, as thesethings were not known in their day, but are the work of their successors of theSpiritual Israel. For my part, although I would not willingly mislead[Page 20]anyone concerning the teachings of those of ancient days, and upon matters ofhistorical accuracy stand subject to cor rection from any who are bettetinformed than I am in these matters (and their name is legion), I care not onejot for the authority of tradition if it hampers the free development of asystem of such practical value as the Holy Qabalah, and I use the work of mypredecessors as a quarry whence I fetch the stone to build my city. Neither am Ilimited to this quarry by any ordinance that I know of; but fetch also cedarfrom Lebanon and gold from Ophir if it suits my purpose.Mystical Qabala Page 164. Let it be clearly understood, therefore, that I do not say, This is theteaching of the ancient Rabbis; rather do I say, This is the practice of themodern Qabalists, and for us a much more vital matter, for it is a practicalsystem of spiritual unfoldment; it is the Yoga of the West.5. Having thus guarded myself as far as possible against blame for not havingdone what I never undertook to do, let me now define my own position in thematter of scholarship and general qualifications for the task in hand. So far asactual scholarship goes, I am in the same class as William Shakespeare, havinglittle Latin and less Greek, and of Hebrew only that peculiar portion which iscultivated by occultists-the ability to transliterate unpointed Hebrew scriptfor the purposes of Gematric calculations. Of any knowledge of Hebrew as alanguage I am guiltless.6. Whether such frank acknowledgment of my deficiencies will serve to disarmcriticism I do not know; no doubt it will be alleged against me, and not withoutjustification, that one so ill-equipped should not have undertaken the task atall. To this I reply that if one saw a man dying injured, should the admittedabsence of a medical qualification debar one from going to his assistance andgiving him what help one could, pending the arrival of qualified attention? Mywork upon the Qabalah is of the nature of first aid. I find an invaluable systemlying neglected, and ill-qualified for the task as I may be, I am stnving todraw attention to its possibilities and restore it to its proper place as thekey to Western occultism; and it is my chief hope in so doing that it mayattract the attention of scholars, and that they will continue the task oftranslation and investigation of the Qabalistic manuscripts, which are as yet avein of which only the outcroppings have been worked.7. One qualification for my task I can plead in justification, however. For thelast ten years I have lived and moved and had my being in the Practical Qabalab;I have used its methods both subjectively and objectively till they have becomea part of myself; and I know from experience what they yield in psychic andspiritual results, and their incalculable value as a method of using the mind.8. It is not required of those who would use the Qabalah as their Yoga that theyshould acquire any extensive knowledge of the Hebrew language; all they need isto be able to read and write the Hebrew characters. The modern Qabalah has beenpretty thoroughly naturalised in the English language, but it retains, and mustever retain, all its Words of Power in Hebrew, which is the sacred language ofthe West just as Sanscrit is the sacred language of the East. There are thosewho have objected to the free employment of Sanscrit terms in occult literature,and no doubt they will object even more strongly to the employment of Hebrewcharacters, but their use is unavoidable, for every letter in Hebrew is also anumber, and the numbers to which words add up are not only an important clue totheir significance, but can also be used to express the relationships existingbetween different ideas and potencies.9. According to MacGregor Mathers, in the admirable essay which forms theintroduction to his book, the Qabalah is usually classed under four heads:Mystical Qabala Page 17[Page 22]The Practical Qabalah, which deals with talismanic and ceremonial magic.The Dogmatic Qabalah, which consists of the Qabalistic literature.The Literal Qabalah, which deals with the use of letters and numbers.The Unwritten Qabalah, which consists of a correct knowledge of the manner inwhich the symbol-systems are arranged on the Tree of Life, and concerning whichMacGregor Mathers says, \"I may say no more on this point, not even whether Imyself have or have not received it.\" But as this portentous hint is elaboratedby the late Mrs MacGregor Mathers in her introduction to the new edition of hisbook in the following plain-spoken words, \"Simultaneously with the publicationof the Qabalah in 1887, he received instructions from his occult teachers toprepare what was eventually to become his esoteric school,\" it may bejustifiable to say that if he did receive the Unwritten Qabalah, it has for someyears ceased to be unwritten, for after a quarrel with MacGregor Mathers,Aleister Crowley, the well-known author and scholar, published the lot. Hisbooks are now rare and hard to come by, and being much valued by the morescholarly of esotericists, their price has gone up out of sight, and they seldomcome into the second-hand book market.10. The breaking of an initiation oath is a serious matter, and a thing that I,for my part, do not care to do; but I admit of no authority that debars me fromcollecting and collating all available material that has been published upon anysubject, and interpreting it according to the best of my understanding. In thesepages it is the system given by Crowley of which I shall avail myself tosupplement the points upon which MacGregor Mathers, Wynn Westcott, and A. E.Waite, the principal modern authorities upon the Qabalah, are silent.11. As to whether I myself have received any knowledge of the Unwritten Qabalab,it would as ill beseem me as MacGregor Mathers to be explicit upon this point,and having followed his classic example of burying my head in the sand andwaving my tail, I will return to the consideration of the matter in hand.12. The essence of the Unwritten Qabalab lies in the knowledge of the order inwhich certain sets of symbols are arranged upon the Tree of Life. This Tree, OtzChiim, consists of the Ten Holy Sephiroth arranged in a particular pattern andconnected by lines which are called the Thirty-two Paths of the Sepher Yetzirah,or Divine Emanations (see The Sepher Yetzirah, by Wynn Westcott). Here thereexists one of the \"blinds,\" or traps for the uninitiated, in which the ancientRabbis delighted. We find, if we count them, that there are twenty-two, notthirty-two Paths upon the Tree; but for their purposes the Rabbis treated theTen Sephiroth themselves as Paths, thus misleading the uninitiated.Mystical Qabala Page 18Thus the first ten Paths of the Sepher Yetzirah are assigned to the TenSephiroth, and the following twenty-two to the actual Paths themselves. It willthen be seen how the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet can be associatedwith the Paths without discrepancy or overlapping. With them also are associatedthe twenty-two Tarot trumps, the Atus, or Abodes of Thoth. Concerning the Tarotcards there are three modern authorities of note: Dr Encausse, or \"Papus,\" theFrench writer; Mr A. E. Waite; and the MSS. of MacGregor Mathers' Order of theGolden Dawn, which Crowley published upon his own authority.All three are different. Concerning the system Mr Waite gives, he himself says,\"There is another method known to initiates.\" There is reason to suppose thatthis is the method used by Mathers. Papus disagrees with both these writers inhis method, but as his system does violence to many of the correspondences whenplaced upon the Tree, the final test of all systems, and as the Mathers-Crowleysystem fits admirably, I think we may justly conclude that the latter is thecorrect traditional order, and I propose to adhere to it in these pages.13. The Qabalists further placed upon the Paths of the Tree the Signs of theZodiac, the Planets, and the Elements. Now there are twelve Signs, sevenPlanets, and four Elements, making twenty-three symbols in all. How are these tobe fitted on to the Twenty-two Paths? Herein is another \"blind,\" but thesolution is simple. Upon the physical plane[Page 24]we are ourselves in the Element of Earth, therefore that symbol does not appearupon the Paths which lead into the Unseen. Remove this, and we are left withtwenty-two symbols, which fit accurately and, correctly placed, are found tocorrespond perfectly with the Tarot trumps, each elucidating the other in themost remarkabl& fashion, and giving the keys to esoteric astrology and Tarotdivination.14. The essence of each Path is to be found in the fact that it connects two ofthe Sephiroth, and we can only understand its significance by taking intoaccount the nature of the linked Spheres upon the Tree. But a Sephirab cannot beunderstood upon a single planc; it has a fourfold nature. The Qabalists expressthis by saying that there are four worlds:Atziluth, the Archetypal World, or World of Emanations; the Divine World.Briah, the World of Creation, also called Khorsia, the World of Thrones.Yetzirah, the World of Formation and of Angels.Assiah, the World of Action; the World of Matter.(See MacGregor Mathers, The Qabalah Unveiled.)15. The Ten Holy Sephiroth are held to have each its own point of contact witheach of the four Worlds of the Qabalists. In the Atziluthic World they manifestthrough the Ten Holy Names of God; in other words, the Great Unmanifest,shadowed forth through the Mystical Qabala Page 19Three Negative Veils of Existence which hang behind the Crown, declares itselfin manifestation as ten different aspects which are represented by the differentnames used to denote Deity in the Hebrew Scriptures. These are variouslyrendered in the Authorised Version, and a knowledge of their true significanceand the spheres to which they belong enables us to read many of the riddles ofthe Old Testament.16. In the Briatic World the Divine Emanations are held to manifest through theTen Mighty Archangels, whose names play such an important part in ceremonialmagic; it is the worn and effaced remnants of these Words of Power that are the\"barbarous names of evocation\" of mediaeval magic, not one letter of which maybe changed.\" Why this is so may readily be seen when we remember that in Hebrewa letter is also a number, and the numbers of a Name have an importantsignificance.17. In the Yetziratic World the Divine Emanations manifest, not through a singleBeing, but through different types of beings, which are called the Angelic Hostsor Choirs.18. The Assiatic World is not, strictly speaking, the World of Matter whenviewed from the Sephirotic standpoint, but rather the Lower Astral and EthericPlanes which, together, form the background of matter. Upon the physical planethe Divine Emanations manifrst through what may not inapdy be called the TenMundane Chakras, likening these centres of manifestation to the centres thatexist in the human body, an exact analogy. These Chakras are the Primum Mobileor First Swirlings, the Sphere of the Zodiac, the seven planets, and theElements taken together-ten in all.19. It will be seen from the foregoing that each Sephirah will thereforeconsist, firstly, of its Mundane Chakra; secondly, of an angelic host of beings,Devas or Archons, Principalities or Powers, according to the terminology used;thirdly, an Arch-angelic Consciousness, or Throne; and fourthly, a specialaspect of the Deity. God as He is, in His entirety, being hidden behind theNegative Veils of Existence, incomprehensible to unenlightened humanconsciousness.20. The Sephiroth may justly be considered macrocosmic, and the Pathsmicrocosmic; for the Sephiroth, connected as they sometimes are in old diagramsby a flash of lightning, which is often depicted as hilted like a fiery sword,represent the successive Divine Emanations which constitute creative evolution;whereas the Paths represent the successive stages of the unfolding of cosmicrealisation in human consciousness; in old pictures a serpent is often depictedas twined about the boughs of the Tree. This is the serpent Nechushtan \"whoholdeth his tail in his mouth,\" the symbol of wisdom and initiation. The coilsof this serpent, when correctly arranged[Page 26]upon the Tree, cross each of the Paths in succession and see to indicate theorder in which they should be numbered. Witb the help of this glyph, then, it isa simple matter to arrange all the tables of symbols in their correct positionsupon the Tree, granted that the symbols are given in their correct order in thetables. In certain modern books which rank Mystical Qabala Page 20as authorities upon the subject the correct order is not given, the writersapparently holding that this should not be revealed to the uninitiated. But asthis order is given correctly in certain older books, and, for the matter ofthat, in the Bible itself and the Qabalistic literature, there seems to me nopoint in deliberately misleading students with spurious information. To refuseto divulge anything may be justifiable, but how is it possible to justify thehanding on of misleading statements? No one is going to be persecuted nowadaysfor their studies in unorthodox sciences, so there can be but one purpose inwithholding teaching that relates solely to the theory of the universe and thephilosophy arising therefrom, and in no way to the methods of practical magic,and that purpose is to retain a monopoly of the knowledge which confersprestige, if not power.21. For my part I believe that this selfishness and exclusiveness is the bane ofthe occult movement rather than its safeguard. It is the old sin of retainingthe knowledge of God in the hands of a priesthood and denying it to all outsidethe sacred clan; justifiable enough when the people were savages, butunjustifiable in the case of the modern student. For when all is said and done,the desired information can be worked out from existing literature by those whocare to take the trouble, or purchased plainly set forth by those who can affordhigh prices for books now rare. Surely the possession of ample time and amplecash should not be the test of the fitness to obtain the Sacred Wisdom?22. No doubt I shall expose myself to a shower of abuse from theself-constituted guardians of this knowledge who may hold that their precioussecrets have been betrayed.To this I reply that I am not betraying anything that is secret, but collectingthat which has already been given to the world and is of a simple and well-knownnature. When I first had access to certain manuscripts, I believed them to besecret, and unknown to the world at large, but a wider acquaintance with occultliterature has revealed to me that the information is to be found scatteredbroadcast through it. Much, in fact, to which the initiate is sworn to secrecyhas been published by Mathers and Wynn Westcott themselves, and as recently as1926 a new edition of Mathers' work on the Qabalab was brought out under theeditorship of his widow (who may be assumed to have known his wishes), and inthat work will be found most of the tables that I give in these pages. As thesecatalogues of beings were originally given to the world by Isaiah, Ezekiel, andvarious mediaeval Rabbis, it may justly be held that the copyright in them haslapsed owing to the passage of time. In any case such ownership as there may bein these ideas is vested in the original author and not in any subsequentcommentator, and that author, according to the Qabalah itself, is the ArchangelMetatron.23. Much that was once common knowledge has been gathered up and confined underthe initiate's oath of secrecy. It is Crowley's jibe at his teachers that theybound him to secrecy with terrible oaths and then \"confided the Hebrew alphabetto his safe keeping.\"24. The philosophy of the Qabalah is the esotericism of the West. In it we findsuch a cosmogony as is found in the Stanzas of Dyzan, which were the basis ofMme Blavatsky's work. Herein she found the framework of traditional doctrinewhich she expounded in her great book, The 5ecret Doctrine. This QabalisticCosmogony is the Christian Gnosis. Without it we have an incomplete system inour religion, and it is' this Mystical Qabala Page 21incomplete system which has been the weakness of Christianity. The EarlyFathers, in the homely metaphor, threw away the baby with the bath-water. A verycursory acquaintance with the Qabalah serves to show that here we have theessential keys to the riddles of Scripture in general and the prophetic books inparticular. Is there any good[Page 28]reason why initiates of the present day should put all this knowledge into asecret box and sit upon the lid? If they consider that I am wrong to giveaccurate information upoo matters which they consider their private preserve, Ireply that this is a free country and they are entitled to their opinion.CHAPTER VNEGATIVE EXISTENCE1. The esotericist, when endeavouring to formulate his philosophy forcommunication to others, is confronted by the fact that his knowledge of thehigher forms of existence is obtained by a process other than thought; and thisprocess only commences when thought is left behind. Consequently it is only inthat region of consciousness which transcends thought that the highest form oftranscendental ideas is known and understood; and it is only to those who areable to use this aspect of consciousness that he can communicate his ideas intheir original form. When he wants to communicate these ideas to those who havehad no experience of this mode of consciousness, he must either crystallise theminto form or fail to convey any adequate impression. Mystics have used everyimaginable simile in the endeavour to convey their impressions; philosophershave lost themselves in a maze of words; and all to no purpose so far as theunilluminated soul is concerned. The Qabalists, however) use another method.They do not try to explain to the mind that which the mind is not equipped todeal with; they give it a series of symbols to meditate upon, and these enableit to build the stairway of realisation step by step and to climb where itcannot fly. The mind can no more grasp transcendent philosophy than the eye cansee music.2. The Tree of Life, as cannot too often be emphasised, is not so much a systemas a method; those who formulated it realised the important truth that in orderto obtain clarity of vision one must circumscribe the field of vision. MostPhilosophers founded their systems upon the Absolute; but[Page 30]this is a shifting foundation, for the human mind can neither define nor graspthe Absolute. Some others try to use a negation for their foundation, declaringthat the Absolute is, and must ever be, unknowable. The Qabalists do neither ofthese things.Mystical Qabala Page 22They content themselves with saying that the Absolute is unknown to the state ofconsciousness which is normal to human beings.3. For the purposes of their system, therefore, they draw a veil at a certainpoint in manifestation, not because there is nothing there, but because themind, as such, must stop there, When the human mind has been brought to itshighest stage of development, and consciousness can detach itself ~ and, as itwere, stand upon its own shoulders, we may be abie to penetrate the Veils ofNegative Existence, as they are called. But for all practical purposes we canunderstand the nature of the cosmos if we are content to accept the Veils asphilosophical conventions, and realise that they correspond to humanlimitations, not to cosmic conditions. The origin of things is inexplicable interms of our philosophy. However far we push our inquiries back into origins inthe world of manifestation, we find a preceding existence. It is only when weare content to draw the Veil of Negative Existence across the path which leadsback to beginnings that we get a background against which a First Cause becomesvisible. And this First Cause is not a rootless origin, but a First Appearanceon the Plane of Manifestation. Thus far and no farther can the mind go back; butwe must always remember that different minds go back different distances, andthat for some the Veil is drawn in one place, and for others in another. Theignorant man goes no further than the concept of God as an old man with a longwhite beard who sat on a golden throne and gave orders for creation. Thescientist will go back a little further before he is compelled to draw a veilcalled the ether; and the philosopher will go back yet further before he draws aveil called the Absolute; but the initiate will go back furthest of all becausehe has learnt to do his thinking in symbols, and symbols are to the mind whattools are to the hand-an extended application of its powers.4. The Qabalist takes for his starting-point Kether, the Crown, the firstSephirah~ which he symbolises by the figure One, Unity, and by the Point withinthe Circle. From this he traces backward the three Veils of Negative Existence.This is quite a different matter from starting at the Absolute and trying towork forwards into evolution. It may not yield immediately accurate and completeknowledge of the origin of all things, but it enables the mind to make a start;and unless we can make a start we have no hope of a finish.5. The Qabalist, then, starts where he can-at the first point that is within thereach of finite consciousness. Kether is equated with the most transcendent formof God that we can conceive, Whose name is Ehieh, translated in the AuthorisedVersion of the Bible as \"I am,\" or, more explicitly, the Self-Existing One, PureBeing.6. But these words are words and nothing more unless they convey an impressionto the mind, and in themselves they cannot do that. They must be related toother ideas before they have any significance. We only begin to understandKether when we study Chokmah, the Second Sephirah, its emanation; it is onlywhen we see the full unfoldment of the Ten Sephiroth that we are ready toapproach Kether, and then we approach it with the data that gives us the key toits nature. In working with the Tree it is wisest to keep on going over it,rather than to concentrate upon a single point until it is mastered, for onething explains another, and it is out of the perception of the relationshipsbetween the Mystical Qabala Page 23different symbols that enlightenment arises. Again we say, the Tree is a methodof using the mind, not a system of knowledge.7. But at the moment we are not engaged in the study of the Emanations, but oforigins, so far as the human mind may hope to penetrate them; and paradoxical asit may appear, we shall penetrate further when we draw the Veils across themthan when we try to pierce the darkness. We will, then, sum up the position ofKether in one sentence, a sentence[Page 32]that can have but little significance for the student approaching the subjectfor the first time, but which must be borne in mind, for its significance willbegin to dawn presently.In so doing,we are adhering to the ancient esoteric tradition of giving thestudent a symbol to incubate till it hatches in his mind, rather than explicitinstruction which would convey nothing to him.The seed-sentence then, which we cast into the suheonscious mind of the reader,is this:\"Kether is the Malkuth of the Unmanifest.\" Mathers says ( op. cit. ): \"Thelimitless ocean of negative light does not proceed from a centre, for it iscentreless, but it concentrates a centre, which is the number One of themanifested Sephiroth, Ketlier, the Crown, the First Sephirah.\"8. These words in themselves contain contradictions and unthinkable; negativelight is simply a way of saying that the thing described, though having certainqualities in common with light, is nevertheless not light as we know it. Thistells us very little about that which it is intelided to describe. We are toldnot to make the mistake of thinking of it as light, but we are not told how tothink of it as it really is, and for the very good reason that the mind is notequipped with any images under which to represent it, and must therefore let italone till growth takes place. Nevertheless, althoughthese words do not tell uaall that we would like to know, they convey certain images to imagination; thesesink into the subconscious mind which are related to them. Thus knowledge growsfrom more to more when the Qabalistic method is given its practical applicationas the Yoga of the West.9. The Qabalists recognise four planes of manifestation, and three planes ofunmanifestation, or Negative Existence. The first of these is called AIN,Negativity; the second, AIN SOPH, the Limitless; the third, AIN SOPH AUR, theLimitless Light. It is out of this last that Kether is concentrated. These threeterms are called the three Veils of Negative Existence - depending back fromKether; in other words, they are the algebraic symbols that enable us to thinkof that which transcends thought, and which at the same time hide that whichthey represent; they are the masks of transcendent realities. If we think of thestates of negative existence in terms of anything that we know, we shall err,for whatever else they may be, they cannot be that, being unmanifest. Theexpression\"Veils,\" therefore, teaches us to use these ideas as counters, of no value inthemselves, but useful to us in our calculations. This is the true use of allsymbols; they veil that which they represent until we can reduce them to termswe can comprehend; nevertheless they enable us to use in our calculations ideaswhich would otherwise be unthinkable.Mystical Qabala Page 24And as the essence of the Tree lies in the fact that it causes its symbols toelucidate one another by means of their relative positions, these Veils serve asthe scaffolding of thought, enabling us to take our bearings in regions as yetuncharted. Such Veils, or non-concrete symbols, are, however, of no value to usunless one side of the Veil abuts upon known country. The Veils, in fact, whilethey conceal that which they represent, enable us to see clearly that to whichthey form a background. This is their function, and the only reason they arereferred to. It is only by reason of our infirmities that we need to have theseunresolvable symbols presented to us, and the mind disciplined in esotericphilosophy soon learns to work within these limitations and accept as a paintedveil the symbol of that which lies beyond its ken. This way lies the unfoldementof wisdom, for the mind grows with what it feeds upon, and one of these days,when we have climbed to Kether, we may hope to stretch out our hands and rendthe Veil and look through into the Limitless Light. The esotericist does notlimit himself by declaring the Unknown to be the Unknowable, for he is above allthings an evolutionist, and knows that that which we cannot compass to-day wemay achieve to-morrow of cosmic time. He knows, too, that evolutionary time isan individual matter upon the inner planes, and is measured, not regulated, bythe revolution of the earth upon its axis.10. These three Veils - AIN, Negativity; AIN SOPH, the[Page 34]Limitless ; and AIN SOPH AUR, the Limitless Light - though we cannot hope tounderstand them, nevertheless suggest to out minds certain ideas. Negativityimplies Being or existence of a nature which we cannot comprehend. We cannotconceive of a thing which 35, and yet is not; therefore we must conceive of aform of being of which we have never had any conscious experience; a form ofbeing which, according to our concepts of existence, does not exist, and yet, ifone may express it so, exists according to its own idea of existence. In thewords of a very wise man: There are more things in heaven and earth than aredreamt of in our philosophy.11. But although we say that Negative Existence is outside the range of ourrealisation, it does not mean that we are outside the range of its influence. Ifthis were so, we could dismiss it as non-existent so far as we are concerned,and our interest in it would be at an end. On the contrary, although we have notdirect access to its being, all that we know as existing has its roots in thisNegative Existence, so that, although we cannot know it directly, we haveexperience of it at one remove. That is to say, although we cannot know itsnature, we know its effects, in the same way as we are ignorant of the nature ofelectricity yet are able to turn it to good account in our lives, and from ourexperience of its effects we are able to come to certain conclusions concerningsome at least of the qualities it must possess. Those who have penetratedfurthest into the Unseen have given us symbolic descriptions by means of whichwe may turn our minds in the direction of the Absolute, even if we cannot reachit. They have spoken of Negative Existence as Light: \"Ain Soph Aur, theLimitless Light.\" They have spoken of the First Manifest as Sound: \"In thebeginning was the Word.\" I remember once hearing a man, who was an adept if everthere was one, say, \"If you want to know what God is, I can tell you in oneMystical Qabala Page 25word: God is pressure.\" And immediately an image leapt to my mind and arealisation followed. I could conceive the outflowing of life through everychannel of existence. I felt that a genuine realisation of the nature of God hadbeen conveyed to me. And yet, if one catfle to analyse the words, there wasnothing in them; nevertheless they had the power to convey an image, a symbol,to the mind, and the mind, working upon it in the realm of intuition beyond thesphere of reason, achieved a realisation, even if that realisation could only bereduced to the sphere of concrete thought as an image.12. We must clearly realise that in these highly abstract regions the mind canuse nothing but symbols; but these symbols have the power to convey realisationsto minds that know how to use them; these symbols are the seeds of thoughtwhence understanding arises, even if we are not able to expand the symbol itselfinto a concrete realisation.13. Little by little, like a rising tide, realisation is concreting theAbstract, assimilating and expressing in terms of its own nature things whichbelong to another sphere; and we shall make a great mistake if we try to provewith Herbert Spencer that because a thing is unknown by any capacity of the mindwe at present possess, that it must for ever be Unknowable. Time is not onlyincreasing our knowledge, but evolution is increasing our capacity andinitiation, which is the forcing-house of evolution, bringing faculties to birthout of due season, brings the consciousness of the adept within reach of vastapprehensions which are as yet below the horizon of the human mind. These ideas,though clearly apprehended by himself after another mode of consciousness,cannot be conveyed by him to anyone who does not share this mode ofconsciousness. He can only put them forth in symbolic form; but any mind thathas in any way had experienc~ of this wider mode of functioning will be able tolay hold on these ideas on their own plane, although it may be unable totranslate them into the sphere of conscious thought. In this way, therefore, inthe literature of esoteric science there are scattered seed-ideas such as\"God is pressure\" and \"Kether is the Malkuth of Negative Existence.\" Theseimages, whose content does not belong to our sphere at all, are as the malegerms of thought which fecundate the ova of concrete realisation. In them-[Page 36]selves they are incapable of maintaining more than the fugitive existence inconsciousness as a flash of realisation, but without them the ova ofphilosophical thought will be infertile. Impregnated by them, however, thoughtheir suhstance is absorbed and lost in the very act of impregnation growthtakes place within the formless germ of thought, and ultimately, after duegestation beyond the threshold of consciousness, the mind gives birth to anidea.14. If we want to get the best out of our minds, we must learn to allow for thisperiod of latency, this impregnation of our minds by something outside our planeof existence, and its gestation beyond the threshold of consciousness. Theinvocations of an initiation ceremony are designed to call down thisimpregnating influence upon the consciousness of the candidate. Hence it is thatthe Paths of the Tree, which are the stages of Mystical Qabala Page 26illumination of the soul, are intimately associated with the symbolism ofinitiation ceremonies.CHAPTER VIOTZ CHIIM, THE TREE OF LIFE1. Before we can understand the significance of any individual Sephirah, we mustgrasp the broad outlines of the OTZ CHIIM, the Tree of Life, as a whole.2. It is a glyph, that is to say a composite symbol, which is intended torepresent the cosmos in its entirety and the soul of man as related thereto; andthe more we study it, the more we see that it is an amazingly adequaterepresentation; we use it as the engineer or the mathematician uses hissliding-rule, to scan and calculate the intricacies of existence, visible andinvisible, in external nature or the hidden depth of the soul.3. It is represented, as will be seen from diagram III, as a set of ten circlesarranged in a certain pattern, and connected among themselves by lines. Thecircles are the Ten Holy Sephiroth, and the connecting lines are the Paths,twenty-two in number.4. Each Sephirah (which is the singular form of the word of which Sephiroth isthe plural) is a phase of evolution, and in the language of the Rabbis they arecalled the Ten Holy Emanations. The Paths between them are phases of subjectiveconsciousness, the Paths or grades (Latin, gradus, step) by which the soulunfolds its realisation of the cosmos. The Sephiroth are objective; the Pathsare subjective.5. Let it be recalled again that I am not expounding the traditional Qabalah ofthe Rabbis as a historical curio, but the structure that has been raised upon itby generations of students, initiates all of them, adepts some of them, who havemade the Tree of Life their instrument of spiritual development and magicalwork. This is the modern Qabalah, the[Page 38]Alchemical Qabalah as it has sometimes been called, and it contains all mannerof things beside traditional Rabbinical lore, as will be seen in due course.6. Let us now consider the general lay-out and significance of the Tree. It willbe seen that the circles which represent the Sephiroth are arranged in threevertical columns (see diagram I), and that at the head of the centre, higherthan any other, forming the apex of the topmost triangle of Sephiroth, is theSephirah Kether, to which we referred in the previous chapter. To quote againthe words of MacGregor Mathers, \"The limitless ocean of negative light does notproceed from a centre, for it is centreless, but it concentrates a MysticalQabala Page 27centre, which is the number one of the manifested Sephiroth, Kether, the Crown,the First Sephirah.\"7. Mme Blavatsky draws from Eastern sources the teron \"The point within thecircle\" to express the First Becoming of manifestation, and the idea iscontained in the Rabbinical term, Nequdah Rashunab, the Primal Point, a nameapplied to Kether.S. But Kether does not represent a position in space. The Am Soph Aur has beencalled a circle whose centre is every-where and whose circumference is nowhere,a statement which, like so many in occultism, is inconceivable, yet neverthelesspresents an image to the mind and therefore serves its purpose. Kether, then(and for the matter of that, all the other Sephiroth), is a state or conditionof existence. We must always bear in mind that the planes do not tower up oneabove another into the empyrean like the storeys of a building, but areconditions of being, states of existence of different types, and though theydeveloped successively in time, they occur simultaneously in space; existence ofall types being present in a single being, as we realise when we remember thatthe being of man is made up of a physical body, emotions, mind, and spirit, alloccupying the same space at the same time.9. If anyone has ever watched a heated liquid, at saturation point, crystalliseout as it cools, they will have a useful symbol of Kether. Fill a tumbler withboiling water and dissolve in it as much sugar as it will take up, and then, asthe mixture cools, watch the sugar crystals appearing. When you have done thisin actuality, and not merely read about it, you will have a concept under whichyou can think of the First Manifest coming into existence out of the PrimordialUnmanifest. The liquid is transparent and formless, but a change occurs withinit, and crystals, solid, visible, and of a definite form, begin to appear.Equally may we conceive that a change occurs within the Limitless Light, andKether crystallises out.10. I do not propose at the present moment to go deeply into the nature of anyof the Sephiroth, but merely to indicate the general scheme of the Tree. Weshall go over the ground again and again in the course of these pages until acomprehensive concept is built up. This can only be done gradually, and if wespend a great deal of time upon an individual point before the student has ageneral concept, much of that time will be wasted because the bearing of thatconcept on the scheme as a whole will not be understood. The Rabbis themselvesapply to Kether the titles, Concealed of the Concealed, and the InscrutableHeight, hinting that there is not a great deal that the human mind can hope toknow about Kether.11. It is worthy of note that Exoteric Judaism, to whose liabilitiesChristianity is the not altogether fortunate heir, does not contain any conceptof the Emanations, or overflowing of the Sephiroth one from another. It declaresthat God made the sea and the hills and the beasts of the field, and wevisualise this process, if we visualise it at all, as the work of a celestialcraftsman fashioning each new phase of manifestation and putting the finishedproduct in its place in the world. This concept kept science back for hundredsof years in Western Europe, and in the end men of science had to break withreligion and endure Mystical Qabala Page 28persecution as heretics in order to arrive at that conception of evolution whichwas explicitly taught in the Mystic Tradition of Israel, a tradition with whichthe writers of the Old Testament were unquestionably familiar, for their worksare full of Qabalistic references and implications.[Page 40]12. The Qabalah does not conceive of God as fabricating creation stage by stage,but thinks of the different phases of manifestation as evolving one fromanother, as if each Sephirah were a pool which, being filled, overflowed into alower pool. To borrow again from MacGregor Mathers, hidden moan acorn is an oakwith its acorns, and hidden in each of these is an oak with its acorns. So eachSephirab contains the Potentiality of all that come after it in the scale ofdowoflowing manifestation. Kether contains the rest of the Sephiroth, nine innumber; and Chokmah, the second, contains the potentialities of all itssuccessors, eight in number. But in each Sephirah only one aspect ofmanifestation is unfolded; the subsequent ones remain latent, and the precedingones are received by reflection. Each Sephirah, then, is a pure form ofexistence in its essence; the influence of preceding phases of evolution isexternal to it, being reflected. These aspects, as it were, having beencrystallised out in the previous stages, are no longer in solution in theoutfiowing stream of manifestation which ever proceedeth from the Unmanifestthrough the channel of Kether. When therefore we want to find the essentialnature, the basis of manifestation, of a particular type of existence, we get itin the Sephirah to which it corresponds when we meditate upon that Sephirah inits primal form; for there are four forms, or wor]ds, under which the Qabalistsconceive of the Tree, and these we will consider in due course. They are onlyreferred to now in order that the student may have enough background to see hispicture in perspective.13. The student will find it very helpful to refer to the chapters in TheAncient Wisdom, by Annie Besant, which deal with the phases of evolution. Thesethrow much light upon the subject with which we are dealing, though the systemof classification is not the same.14. Let us conceive of Kether, then, as a fountain which fills its basin, andthe overflow therefrom feeds another fountain, which in its turn fills its basinand overflows. The Unmanifest for ever flows under pressure into Kether, andthere comes a time when evolution has gone as far as it can in the extremesimplicity of the form of existence of the First Manifest. All possiblecombinations have been formed, and they have undergone all possiblepermutations. Action and reaction are stereotyped, there can be no newdevelopment save the combining of the combinations among themselves. Force hasformed all possible units; the next phase of developrnent is for these units tocombine into more complex structures. When this occurs, a new and more highlyorganised phase of existence begins; all that has already been evolved remains,but that which evolves now is more than the sum of the previously existingparts, for new capacities come into being.15. This new phase represents a change of mode ofexistence. Just as Kethercrystallised out of the Limitless Light, so the second Sephirab, Chokmah,crystallises out of Kether in Mystical Qabala Page 29this new mode of being, this new system of actions and reactions which haveceased to be simple and direct and become complex and tangential. We now havetwo modes of existence, the simplicity of Kether and the relative complexity ofChokmah; both these are so simple that no kind of life known to us could hemaintained in them ; nevertheless, they are the forerunners of organic life. Wemight say that Kether is the first activity of manifestation, movement; it is acondition of pure becoming, Rashith ha Gilgalim, the First Swirlings, thecommencement of Whirling Motions as it is called by the Qabalists-Primum Mobileas it is called by the Alchemists. Chokmah, the Second Sephirab, is called bythe Rabbis Mazloth, the Sphere of the Zodiac. Here we have introduced theconcept of the circle with its segments. Creation has moved onwards. Out of theprimordial Egg has developed the Serpent that holdeth his tail in his mouth, asMme Blavatsky chronicles in her invaluable storehouses of archaic symbolism, theSecret Doctrine and Isis Unveiled.16. In a similar manner to that in which Kether overflowed into Chokmah doesChokmah overflow into Binab, the Third Sephirab. The Paths pursued by theEmanations in these successive overfiowings is represented upon the Tree of Lifeby a Lightning Flash, or in some diagrams by a Flaming[Page 42]Sword. It will be observed by reference to diagram I that the Lightning Flashmust proceed from Kether outwards and downwards to the right to reach Chokmah,and then turns on a level course to the left and proceeds an equal distancebeyond Kether upon that side, and there establishes Binah. The result is atriangular figure upon the glyph, and it is called the Triangle of the ThreeSupernals, or the First Trinity and is separated from the rest of the Sephirothby the Abyss, which normal human consciousness cannot cross.Here are the toots of existence, hidden from our eyes.CHAPTER VIITHE THREE SUPERNALS1. Having considered in outline the development of the three first DivineEmanations, we are now in a position to obtain a deeper insight into theirnature and significance, for we can study them in relation to each other. Thisis the only way to study the Sephiroth, for a single Sephirab, taken by itself,is barren of significance. The Tree of Life is essentially a scheme ofrelationships, stresses, and reflections (see diagram II).2. The Rabbinical books apply many curious appellations to the Sephiroth, and welearn much from considering these; for every word in these books has a weightysignificance, Mystical Qabala Page 30and none are used lightly or for the sake of idle poetic imagery; all are asprecise as scientific terms, which, in fact, is what they are.3. The meaning of the word Kether, we have already noted, is Crown. Chokmahmeans Wisdom, and Binah means Understanding. But pendent to these two latterSephiroth is a curious and mysterious third, which is never represented in theglyph of the Tree; this is the invisible Sephirah, Daath, Knowledge, and it issaid to be formed out of the conjunction of Chokmah and Binah and is situatedastride the Abyss. Crowley tells us that Daath is in another dimension to theother Sephiroth, and forms the apex of a pyramid of which Kethet, Chokmah, andBinah form the three basal angles. To me, Daath presents the idea of realisationand consciousness.4. Let us now proceed to elucidate the Three Supernals according to the methodof the mystical Qabalah, which consists in filling the mind with all thecorrespondences and[Page 44]symbols assigned thereto and letting contemplation work among them.5. It will be observed that these three and their mysterious fourth all containsymbolism relating to the head, which in the archetypal man represents thehighest level of consciousness. When we seek in the Rabbinical literature to seewhat further names may have been applied to them, we find yet more headsymbolism applied to Kether; this, although not specifically referred to them,may be taken to embrace the other two Supernals also, for they are aspects ofKether on a lower plane.6. The Rabbis called Kether, among other titles, which we need not consider now,Arik Anpin, The Vast Countenance, The White Head, The Head Which Is Not. Themagical symbol of Kether, according to Crowley, is an ancient bearded king seenin profile.MacGregor Mathers says: \"The symbolism of the Vast Countenance is that of aprofile in which one side only of the countenance is seen; or as it is said inthe Qabalab, 'In him is all right side.\"' The left side, being turned towardsthe Unmanifest, is for us like the dark side of the moon.7. But Kether is primarily the Crown. Now the Crown is not the head, but restsupon it and above it. Therefore Kether cannot be consciousness, but the rawmaterial of conscious-ness when considered microcosmically, and the raw materialof existence when considered macrocosmically. For there is this twofold way ofconsidering the Tree, as we have already noted; it can be regarded as theuniverse and as the soul of man, and these two aspects throw light upon eachother. In the words of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes: \"As above, so below.\"8. Kether differentiates into Chokmah and Binah before it achieves phenomenalexistence, and these two are called by the Qabalists, Abba, the Supernal Father,and Ama, the Supernal Mother. Binah is also called the Great Sea, and Shahathai,the Sphere of Saturn. As we continue, we shall find that the Sephiroth arecalled successively the Mystical Qabala Page 31Spheres of the planets, but Binah is the first of the Emanations to be soassigned; Kether is called the First Whirlings, and Chokmah the Sphere of theZodiac.9. Now Saturn is the Father of the Gods; he is the greatest of the old gods thatwere the predecessors of the Olympians over which Jupiter rules. In the secrettitles attributed to the Tarot trumps, the Path of Saturn is called, accordingto crowley, The Great One of the Night of Time.10. We have, then, Kether differentiating into an active male potency, Chokmah,and a passive female potency, Binah, and these are placed at the head of the twoside columns formed by the vertical alignment of the Sephiroth in their spacingon the Tree of Life. Of these two columns, the left-hand one under Binah iscalled Severity; the right-hand one under Chokmah is called Mercy; the middleone under Kether is called Mildness, and it is said to be the Column ofEquilibrium. These two side columns are the two pillars that stand at theentrance to King Solomon's Temple and are represented in all Lodges of theMysteries, the candidate himself, when he stands between them, is the MiddlePillar of Equilibrium.11. Here we meet with the idea put forth by Mme Blavatsky, that there can be nomanifestation without differentiation into the Pairs of Opposites. Ketherdifferentiates its two aspects as Chokmah and Binab, and manifestation is inbeing. Now in this supernal triangle, The Head Which Is Not, the Father and theMother, we have the root concept of our cosmogony, and we shall return to itagain and again under innumerable aspects, and each time that we return to it weshall receive illumination. These earlier chapters do not attempt to deal withany of the points exhaustively for reasons already noted, for the studentunfamiliar with the subject (and there are very few students who are familiarwith it) has not yet got the necessary mental furniture of facts to enable himto appreciate the significance of a more detailed study; we are at the presentmoment engaged in assembling this furniture; in due course we shall begin toarrange it into a house of life, and study it in detail.[Page 46]12. Binah, the Superior Mother (as distinguished from Mal kuth, the InferiorMother, the Bride of Microprosopos, the Isis of Nature, the Tenth Sephirah), istwo-aspected, and these aspects are distinguished as Ama, the Dark SterileMother, and Aima, the Bright Fertile Mother. We have already noted that she iscalled the Great Sea, Marah, which not only means Bitter, but also is the rootof Mary; and here we meet again the idea of the Mother, at first virgin, andthen with child by the Holy Spirit.13. By the association of Binah with the sea we are reminded that life had itsprimordial beginnings in the waters; from the sea arose Venus, the archetypalwoman. The association of Saturn suggests the idea of primordial age: \"Beforethe gods that made the gods had drunk at eve their fill\" It suggests the mostancient rocks: \"Within the shady stillness of the vale . . . sat grey-hairedSaturn, quiet as a stone.\" Max Heindel speaks of the Lords of Form as among theearliest phases of evolution, and an inspirational work in Mystical Qabala Page32my possession, The Cosmic Doctrine, speaks of the Lords of Form as the Laws ofGeology.14. Considering again the symbolism of the two lateral columns of the Tree, wesee Chokmah and Binah as Force and Form, the two units of manifestation.15. It would not profit us to go more deeply into the endless ramifications ofthis symbolism at the present moment, for it is carrying us beyond the threeSephiroth we have already studied. Let us proceed to a further consideration ofthe mysterious Daath, which never appears on the Tree, and to which noDeity-name or angelic host is assigned and which has no mundane symbol in planetor element, as have all the other stations on the Tree.16. Daath is produced by the conjunction of Chokmah and Binah, as has beenalready noted. The Supernal Father, Abba, marries the Supernal Mother, Ama, andDaath is the issue. Now Daath is called some curious things by the Qabalists; wewill note a Tew of them.17. In verse 38 of the Book of Concealed Mistery (Mathers' English translationfrom the Latin translation of Knorr von Rosenroth) it says: \"For Father andMother are perpetually conjoined in Yesod, the Foundation (the ninth Sephirah),but concealed under the mystery of Daath or Knowledge\"; and in verse 40 we readconcerning Daath: \"The man that shall say, I am the Lord's, he descendeth. . . .Yod (the tenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet) is the foundation of Knowledge ofthe Father; but all things are called BYODO, that is, all things are applied toYod concerning which this discourse is. All things cohere in the tongue which isconcealed in the mother. That is, through Daath or Knowledge, whereby Wisdom iscombined with Understanding, and the Beautiful Path (Tipha reth, the SixthSephirah) with his bride the Queen (Malkuth, the Tenth Sephirah); and this isthe concealed idea, or soul, pervading the whole emanation. Since it is openedfor that which proceedeth from itself; that is, Daath is itself the beautifulpath, but also the inner, whereto Moses referred; and that Path lieth hid withinthe mother, and is the medium of its conjunction.\" When it is noted that Yod isidentical with the Lingam in the Hindu system; and that Kether, Daath, and theBeautiful Path, Tiphareth, the Sixth Sephirah, are in a line on the MiddlePillar of the Tree, which equates with the spine in man, the microcosm; and thatKundalini is coiled in Yesod, also on the Middle Pillar, we shall see that wehave here an important key for those who are equipped to use it.18. In the Greater Holy Assembly, verse 566 (Mathers' translation), we readconcerning the Head of Microprosopos, whose whole body is being taken as a glyphof the cosmos:\"From the Third Cavity there goes forth a thousand times a thousand conclavesand assemblies, wherein Daath, Knowledge, is contained and dwelleth. And thehollow place of this cavity is between the other two cavities; and all theseconclaves are filled from either side. This is that which is written inProverbs, 'And in knowledge (Daath) shall the conclaves be filled.' And thosethree are expanded over the whole body, on this side and on that, and with themdoes the whole body cohere, and the body is contained by them on Mystical QabalaPage 33[Page 48]every side, and through the whole body are they expanded and diffused.\"19. When it is recalled that Daath is situated at the Point where the Abyssbisects the Middle Pillar, and that up the Middle Pillar lies the Path of theArrow, the way by which consciousness goes when the psychic rises on the Planes,and that here also is Kundalini, we see that in Daath is the secret of bothgeneration and regeneration, the key to the manifestation of all things throughthe differentiation into pairs of Opposites and their union in a Third.20. Thus doth the Tree unfold its secrets to the Qabalists, 21. The SecondTriangle upon the Tree of Life is formed of the Sephiroth Chesed, Geburah, andTiphareth. Chesed is formed by the overflowing of Binah, and is situated in theRight-hand Pillar of Mercy, immediately below Chokmah; the angle of theLightning Flash, which is used to indicate the course of the emanations upon theTree, slopes downwards to the right across the glyph, from Binab at the head ofthe Pillar of Severity to Chesed, which occupies the middle section of thePillar of Mercy. Then the Flash turns and goes horizontally across the glyphback again to the Pillar of Severity, in the middle section of which is foundthe Sephirab Gehurab. Down and to the right slopes once more the symbol ofemanating force, and indicates the Sephirah Tiphareth, which occupies the verycentre of the Tree in the Pillar of Mildness or Equilibrium. These threeSephiroth constitute the next functional triangle we have to consider, andalthough we do not intend to go exhaustively into their symbolism until we havecompleted our schematic survey of the whole system, it is necessary to sayenough to give some clue to their significance and enable them to be assigned toa place in the concept we are building up. This concept is so vast and soin~nite in its elaboration of detail that to attempt to teach it exhaustivelyfrom A to Z must end in confusion. Only gradually can it reveal its significanceto the student as one aspect interprets another. My method of teaching the Treemay not be ideal from the point of view of systematic thought, but I believe itis the only one which will enable the beginner to \"get the hang\" of the subject.It was upon the Tree that I got my own mystical training, and I have lived andmoved and had my being in its company for a good many years now, so I feel thatI am competent to speak upon it from the point of view of practical mysticism;for I know from my own experience the difficulties of getting hold of theQabalistic system, so intricate, abstract, and voluminous, and yet socomprehensive and satisfactory when once it is mastered.22. Before we can consider the Second Triangle of the Tree as a unit, we mustknow the meaning of its component Sephiroth. Chesed means Mercy or Love; it isalso called Gedulah, Greatness or Magnificence, and to it is assigned the Sphereof the planet Jupiter. Geburah means Strength; it is ako called Pachad, Fear; toit is assigned the Sphere of th~ planet Mars. Tiphareth means Beauty, and to itis assigned the Sphere of the Sun. When the gods of the various pagan pantheonsare being correlated with the Spheres on the Tree, it will be found that thesacrificed gods invariably come on to Tiphareth, and for this reason it has beencalled the Christcentre in the Christian Qahalah.Mystical Qabala Page 3423. We now have sufficient material to make a survey of the Second Triangle.Jupiter, the beneficent ruler and lawgiver, is balanced by Mars the Warrior, thefiery and destructive force, and the two are equilibrated in Tiphareth, theRedeemer. In the Supernal Triangle we see the primary Sephirah emanating a pairof opposites which express the two sides of its nature, Chokmah, Force, andBinab, Form, masculine and feminine Sephiroth respectively. In the SecondTriangle we have the pairs of opposites which find their equilibrium in a third,placed upon the Middle Pillar of the Tree. From this we deduce that the FirstTriangle derives its significance from that which lies behind it, and the SecondTriangle derives its significance from that into which it issues forth. In theFirst Triangle we find a representation of the creative forces of the substanceof the universe; in the Second we have a representation of the governing forcesof evolving life. In Chesed is the wise and kindly king, the father of hispeople, organising his realm, building up industry, fostering learning, andbringing the gifts of civilisation. In Geburah we have a warrior king, leadinghis people in battle, defend mg his kingdom from the assaults of the enemy,extending his boundaries by conquest, punishing crime, and destroyingevil-doers, In Tiphareth we have the Saviour, sacrificed upon the Cross for thesalvation of his people, and thereby bringing Geburah into equilibrium withGedulah, or Chesed. Here we find the sphere of all the beneficent sun-gods andhealing gods. Tnus we see that the mercies of Gedulah and the seventies ofGeburah unite for the healing of the nations.24. Behind Tiphareth, traversing the Tree, is drawn Paroketh, the Veil of theTemple, the analogue, on a lower plane, of the Abyss which separates the ThreeSupernals from the rest of the Tree. Like the Abyss, the Veil marks a chasm inconsciousness. The mode of mentation on one side of the chasm differs in kindfrom the mode of mentation prevailing upon the other. Tiphareth is the highestsphere to which normal human consciousness can rise When Philip said to OurLord, \"Show us the Father,\" Jesus replied, \"He that bath seen Me hath seen theFather.\" All the human mind can know of Kether is its reflection in Tiphareth,the Christ-centre, the Sphere of the Son. Paroketh is the Veil of the Templewhich was rent asunder at the Crucifixion.25. We now come in our brief preliminary survey to the Third Triangle composedof the Sephiroth Netzach, Hod, and Yesod. Netzach is the basal Sephirah of thePillar of Mercy, Hod is the basal Sephirah of the Pillar of Severity, and Yesodis upon the Middle Pillar of Mildness or Equilibrium, in direct alignment withKether and Tiphareth. Thus the Third Triangle is an exact replica of the SecondTriangle upon a lower arc.26. The meaning of Netzach is Victory, and to it is assigned the Sphere of theplanet Venus; the meaning of Hod is Glory, and to it is assigned the Sphere ofthe planet Mercury; the meaning of Yesod is Foundation, and to it is assignedthe Sphere of the Moon.27.While the Second Triangle might not inaptly be termed the Ethical Triangle,the Third may well be called the Magical Triangle; and if we assign to Ketherthe Sphere of the Three in One, the undivided Unity, and to Tiphareth the Sphereof the Redeemer or Son, we may be justified in referring to yesod the Sphere ofthe Holy Spirit, the Enlightener; Mystical Qabala Page 35this is an attribution of the Christian Trinity that fits better upon the Treethan its assignation to the Three Supernals, which brings the Son in the placeof Abba, the Father, and the Holy Spirit in the place of Ama, the Mother, and isobviously irrelevant and productive of innumerable discrepancies in thecorrespondences and symbolisms. In this we see an example of the value of theTree as a method of counterchecking vision or meditation; correct attributionsfit upon the Tree through endless ramifications of symbolism, as we saw whenconsidering Binah as the Mother; incorrect symbolism breaks down and reveals itsbizarre associations at the first attempt to follow out a chain ofcorrespondences. It is amazing what ramifications of association-chains can befollowed when the attribution is correct. It seems as if it were only the extentof our knowledge which limits the length of the chain that can be linkedlogically together; it will extend through science, art, mathematics, and theepochs of history; through ethics, psychology, and physiology. It was thispeculiar method of using the mind which in all probability gave the ancientstheir premature knowledge of natural science, knowledge which has had to awaitthe invention of instruments of precision for its confirmation. We get clues tothis method in the dream-analysis of analytical psychology. We might describe itas the symbol-using power of the subconscious mind. It is an instructiveexperiment to toss a mass of irrelevant symbolism into the mind and watch itsort itself out in meditation upon the Tree, rising into consciousness in longassociation-chains like dream analysis.28. Netzach is the Sphere of the Goddess of Nature, Venus. Hod is the Sphere ofMercury, the Greek analogue of the Egyptian Thoth, Lord of Books and Learning.Observing their opposition, we shall expect to find two different aspectsrepresented in them, these finding their equilibrium in a third, Yesod, theSphere of Luna. We see then a Triangle Composed of the Lady of Nature, the Lordof Books, and the Mistress of Witchcraft; in other words, subconsciousness andsuper- consciousness correlate in psychism.29. Anyone who is familiar with practical mysticism knows that there are threepaths of superconsciousness-devotional mysticism, which correlates withTiphareth; nature mysticism, of the inebriating Dionysian. type, which equateswith the Venus Sphere of Netzach; and intellectual mysticism of the occult type,which equates with Hod, the Sphere of Thoth, Lord of Magic. Tiphareth, as willbe seen by reference to the diagram of the Tree, belongs to a higher plane thanany member of the Third Triangle; Yesod, on the other hand, is drawing very nearto the Sphere of Earth.30. To Yesod are assigned all the deities that have the moon in their symbolism:Luna herself; Hecate, with her dominion over evil magic ; and Diana, with herpresidency over child-birth. The physical moon, Yesod in Assiah, as theQabalists would say, with its twenty-eight day cycle, correlates with thereproductive cycle of the human female. Jf the symbolism of the luna crescent betraced through the various pantheons it will be found that the deitiesassociated with it are predominantly female; it is interesting to note inconfirmation of our assignation of the Holy Spirit to Yesod that according toMacGregor Mathers the Holy Spirit is a feminine force. He says (KabbalahUnveiled p. 22): \"We are usually told that the Holy Spirit is masculine. But theword Ruach, Spirit, is feminine, as Mystical Qabala Page 36appears from the following passage of the Sepher Yetzirah, 'Achath (feminine,not Achad, masculine), ruach elohim chum: One is she, the Spirit of the Elohimof Life.'\"When we consider the Middle Pillar as referring to levels of consciousness weshall find further confirmation of this view.31. There remains for our final consideration the Scphitah Malkuth, the Kingdomof Earth. This Sephirah differs from the others in several respects. Firstly, itis not part of any equilibrated triangle, but is said to be the receptacle ofthe influences of all the others.Secondly, it is a fallen Sephirah, for it was cut off from the rest of the Treeby the Fall, and the coils of the Stooping Dragon arising from the World ofShells, the Kingdoms of Unbalanced Force, separate it from its brethren. Behindthe shoulder of the Queen, the Bride of Microprosopos (Malkuth), the Serpentrears his head, and here is said to be the place of severest judgments. TheSphere of Malkuth abuts upon the Hells of the Averse Sephiroth, the Qliphoth, orevil demons. It is the firmament whereby Elohim separated the supernal waters ofBinah from the infernal waters of Leviathan.32. The signification of the Qliphoth must be considered flilly in due course;but having referred to them here in order to explain the position of Malkuth, wemust say something further in order to render the explanation intelligible.33. The Qliphoth (singular Qliphah, an immodest woman or harlot) are the Evil orAverse Sephiroth, each an emanation of unbalanced force from its correspondingSphere upon the Holy Tree; these emanations took place during the criticalperiods of evolution when the Sephiroth were not in equilibrium. For this reasonthey are referred to as the Kings of Unbalanced Force, the Kings of Edom, \"whoruled before there was a king in Israel,\" as the Bible puts it; and in the wordsof the Siphrah Denioutha, the Book of Concaled Mystery (Mathers' translation),\"For before there was equilibrium, countenance beheld not countenance. And thekings of ancient time were dead, and their crowns were found no more; and theearth was desolate.\"34. We have now completed our preliminary survey of the Tree of Life, and thearrangement of the Ten Holy Sephiroth thereon; we also have some clue to theirsignificance and have been given a hint or two of the manner in which the mindworks when it uses these cosmic symbols for its meditations. Consequently we arenow in a position to assign each fresh bit of information to its correctposition in our scheme; we are building up the jigsaw puzzle with a knowledge ofthe outlines of the picture.Crowley has aptly likened the Tree to a card-index file, in which each symbol isan envelope. This is a simile which it would be difficult to improve upon. Inthe course of our studies we shall begin to fill these filing cases, and to findthe cross-indexing among them indicated by the appearance of the same symbol inother associations.CHAPTER VIIITHE PATTERNS OF THE TREEMystical Qabala Page 371. There are various methods by which the Ten Holy Sephiroth can be grouped uponthe Tree of Life. Of these it cannot be said that one is correct and anotherincorrect; they serve different purposes and throw much light upon the rneaningof the individual Sephiroth by revealing their associations and equilibrium.2. They are also of value because they enable the decimal system of the Tree tobe equated with the three, four, and sevenfold systems.3. The primary conformation of the Tree is into three Pillars. It will beobserved by reference to the diagrams that the Sephiroth readily lend themselvesto this threefold vertical division, for they are arranged in three columns.These are called the Right-hand Pillar of Mercy, the Left-hand Pillar ofSeverity, and the Middle Pillar of Mildness or Equilibrium (see diagram I).4. Before proceeding any further we must make clear the significance of theright and left sides of the Tree. As we look at the Tree in the diagram we seeBinah, Geburah, and Hod upon the left side, and Chokmah, Chesed) and Netzachupon the right side; this is the way we view the Tree when We are using it torepresent the Macrocosm. But when we are using it to represent the Microcosm,that is our own being, we, as it were, back into it, so that the Middle Pillarequates with the spine, and the Pillar that contains Binah, Geburah, and Hodwith the right side, and the Pillar that contains Chokmah, Chesed, and Netzachwith the left side. These three Pillars can also be equated with the Shushumna,Ida, and Pingala of the Yoga system. It is very important to remember[Page 56]the reversal of the Tree when it is used as a subjective symbol, otherwiseconfusion results. In his valuable book Upon the literature of the Qabalah, TheHoly Kabalah, Mr Waite, in the frontispiece, for some reason best known tohimself, reverses the usual presentation of the Tree; but it may be taken forgranted that most representations of the symbol give the objective Tree, not thesubjective. When the Tree is being used to indicate the lines of force in theaura, it is the subjective Tree that must be used, so that Geburah equates withthe right arm. In all cases, of course, the Middle Pillar remains steadfast.5. The Pillar of Severity is considered to be negative or feminine, and thePillar of Mercy to be positive or masculine. Superficially it may be thoughtthat these attributions lead to incompatible symbolism, but a study of thePillars in the light of what we now know concerning the individual Sephirothwill reveal that the incompatibilities are purely superficial and that thedeeper significance of the symbolism is entirely consonant.6. It will be observed that the line which indicates the successive developmentof the Sephiroth zigzags from side to side of the glyph and has been aptly namedthe Lightning Flash in consequence. This indicates graphically that theSephiroth are successively positive, negative, and equilibrated. This is a farbetter representation of the process of Mystical Qabala Page 38creation than if the Spheres were represented one above another in a straightline, for it indicates the difference in the nature of the Divine Emanations andtheir relations to each other; for when we look at the glyph of the Tree wereadily perceive the relations existing between the different Sephiroth, and seehow they group, reflect, and react upon each other.7. At the head of the Pillar of Severity, the negative, feminine Pillar, isBinah, the Great Mother. Now to Binah is assigned the Sphere of Saturn, andSaturn is the Giver of Form.At the head of the Pillar of Mercy is Chokmah, the Supernal Father, a malepotency. Thus we see that we have here the apposition of Form and Force.8. In the Second Trinity we have the apposition of Chesed (Jupiter) and Geburah(Mars).Again we have the pairs of opposites of construction in Jupiter, the lawgiverand beneficent ruler, and destruction in Mars, the warrior and destroyer ofevil. It may be asked why such a male potency as Geburah should be placed in thefeminine Pillar. It must be remembered that Mars is a destructive potency, oneof the infortunes in astrology. The positive builds up, the negative breaksdown; the positive is a kinetic force, the negative is a static force.9. These aspects appear again in Netzach at the base of the Pillar of Mercy, andHod at the base of the Pillar of Severity. Netzach is Venus, the Green NatureRay, elemental force, the initiation of the emotions. Hod is Mercury, Hermes,the initiation of knowledge. Netzach is instinct and emotion, a kinetic force;Hod is intellect, concrete thought, the reduction of intuitive knowledge toform.10. We must remember, however, that each Sephirah is negative, that is to sayfeminine, in relation to its predecessor, whence it emanates and whence itreceives the Divine Influence; and positive, masculine, or stimulating inrespect of its successor, to whom it transmits the Divine Influence. Thereforeeach Sephirah is bi-sexual, like a magnet of which one pole must of necessity benegative and the other positive. We may perhaps explain matters further by ananalogy with astrology, and say that a Sephirah in the feminine Pillar iswell-dignified when it is functioning in its negative aspect, and ill-dignifiedwhen functioning positively; and that in the masculine Pillar the position isreversed. Thus Binah, Saturn, is well-dignified when providing stability andendurance, but ill-dignified when the overplus of resistance causes it to becomeactively aggressive and we get obstruction and the accretion of effete matter.On the other hand, Chesed, Mercy, is well-dignified when ordering and preservingall things harmoniously; but ill-dignified when mercy becomes sentimentality andit usurps the Sphere of Saturn, preserving that which the fiery energy of Mars,its opposite number, the Sephirah Geburah, should sweep out of existence.11. The two Pillars, then, represent the Positive - negative forces in Nature,the active and passive, the destructive and constructive, concreting form andfree-moving force.12. The Sephiroth on the Middle Pillar may be taken as representing levels ofconsciousness and the planes on which they operate. Malkuth is sensoryconsciousness; Mystical Qabala Page 39Yesod is astral psychism; Tiphareth is illuminated consciousness, the highestaspect of the personality with which the individuality has coalesced; this isthe condition which really constitutes initiation; it is the consciousness ofthe higher self brought through into the personality. It is a gleam of higherconsciousness coming from behind the veil Paroketh. It is for this reason thatthe Messiahs and Saviours of the world are assigned to Tiphareth in thesymbolism of the Tree, for they were the Light-Bringers to humanity; and as allwho bring fire from heaven must do, they died the sacrificial death for the sakeof mankind. It is here, too, that we die to the lower self in order that we mayrise in the higher self. 'In Jesu morimur.\"13. The Middle Pillar rises through Daath, the Invisible Sephirah, which we havealready seen is Knowledge according to the Rabbis, and conscious awareness orapprehension according to the terminology of the psychologist. At the head ofthis Pillar is Kether, the Crown, the Root of all Being. Consciousness, theri,reaches from the spiritual essence of Kether, through the realisation of Daath,which carries it across the Abyss, into the translated consciousness ofTiphareth, whither it is brought by the sacrifice of the Christ which rends theveil Paroketh; then on into the psychic consciousness of Yesod, the Sphere ofthe Moon, and thence to the sensory brain consciousness of Malkuth.14. Thus does consciousness descend in the course of involution, which is theterm applied to that phase of evolution which leads down from the First Manifestthrough the subtle planes of existence to dense matter; the esotericist should,strictly speaking, only use the term evolution when describing[Page 58]the ascent frorn matter back to spirit, for then is evolved that which wasinvolved in the descent through the subtle phases of development. It is obviousthat nothing can be evolved, unfolded, which was not previously involved,infolded. The actual course of evolution follows the track of the LightningFlash or Flaming Sword, from Kether to Malkuth in the order of development ofthe Sephiroth previously described; but consciousness descends plane by plane,and only begins to manifest when the polarising Sephi roth are in equilibrium;therefore the modes of consciousness are assigned to the Equilibrating Sephirothupon the Middle Pillar, but the magical powers are assigned to the opposingSephiroth, each at the end of the beam of the balance of the pairs of opposites.15. The Way of Initiation follows the coilings of the Serpent of Wisdom upon theTree; but the Way of Illumination follows the Path of the Arrow which is shotfrom the Bow of Promise, Qesheth, the rainbow of astral colours that spreadslike a halo behind Yesod.This is the way of the mystic as distinguished from that of the occultist; it isswift and direct, and free from the danger of the temptation of unbalanced forcethat is met with in either pillar, but it confers no magical powers save thoseof sacrifice in Tiphareth and psychism in Yesod.Mystical Qabala Page 4016. We have noted the Three Trinities of the Tree in our preliminary discussionof the Ten Sephi roth. Let us recapitulate these again for clearness' sake.Mathers calls the First Trinity of Kether, Chokmah, and Binah the IntellectualWorld; the Second Trinity of Chesed, Geburah, and Tiphareth the Moral World; andthe Third Trinity of Netzach, Hod, and Yesod the Material World. To my way ofthinking, this terminology is misleading, for these words do not connote in ourminds what is meant by these Worlds. The intellect is essentially a concretingof intuition and apprehension, and as such is an unsuitable term for theWorld ofthe Three Supernals. With the use of the term Moral World for Chesed, Geburah,and Tiphareth I agree; it is identical with my term, Ethical Triangle; but withthe term Material World for the Trinity[Page 60]of Netzach, Hod, and Yesod I emphatically disagree, for this term belongsexclusively to Malkuth. These three Sephiroth are not material but astral, andfor this Trinity I propose the term Astral, or Magical World; it is not well towrest words from their dictionary meaning, even if you define your use of them,and this Mathers has not troubled to do.17. The Intellectual Sphere is not so much a level as a Pillar, for theintellect, being the content of consciousness, is essentially synthetic. Theseterms, however, are apparently taken from a somewhat crude translation of theHebrew names given to the four levels into which the Qabalists dividemanifestation.18. These four levels permit of yet another grouping of the Sephiroth. Thehighest of these is Atziluth, the Archetypal World, consisting of Kether. Thesecond, Briah, called the Creative World, consists of Chokmah and Binab, theSupernal Abba and Ama, Father and Mother. The third level is that of Yetzirah,the Formative World, consisting of the six central Sephiroth, viz. Chesed,Geburah, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod. The fourth World is Assiah, theMaterial World, represented by Malkuth.19. The Ten Sephiroth are also conformed into Seven Palaces. In the First Palaceare the Three Supernals; in the Seventh Palace are Yesod and Malkuth ; and therest of the Sephiroth each has a Palace to itself. The grouping is of interestas revealing the intimate relationship of Yesod and Mal~th, and enabling thetenfold scale of the Qabalah to be equated with the sevenfold scale ofTheosophy.20. There is also a threefold division of the Sephiroth which is very importantin Qabalistic symbolism. In this system Kether is given the title of Arik Anpin,the Vast Countenance. This is manifested as Abba, the Supernal Father, Chokmah,and Ama, the Supernal Mother, Binab, these being the positive and negativeaspects of the Three in One. These two differentiated aspects, when united, are,according to Mathers, Elohim, that curious Divine Name which is a feminine nounwith a masculine plural attached to it.This union takes place in Daath, the invisible Sephirab.Mystical Qabala Page 4111. The next six Sephiroth are conformed into Zaur Anpin, the LesserCountenance, or Microprosopos, whose special Sephirah is Tiphareth. Theremaining Sephirab, Malkuth, is called the Bride of Microprosopos.22. Microprosopos is also sometimes called the King; Malkuth is then called theQueen.She is also called the Lesser Mother or Terrestrial Eve as distinguished fromBinah, the Supernal Mother.23. These different methods of classifying the Sephiroth are not competingsystems, but are designed to enable the decimal system of the Qabalists to beequated with other systems, using a threefold notation, such as the Christian,or as we have already noted, a sevenfold system like Theosophy; they are alsovaluable as indicating functional affiliations among the Sephiroth themselves.24. The final system of classification which we must note is under thepresidency of the Three Mother Letters of the Hebrew alphabet: Aleph, A; Mem, M;and Shin, Sh. These three, according to the Yetziratic attribution of the Hebrewalphabet, are assigned to the three elements of Air, Water, and Fire. Under thepresidency of Aleph is the Airy triad of Kether, in which is the Root of Air,reflecting downward through Tiphareth, the Solar Fire, into Yesod, the Lunarradiance. In Binali is the Root of Water (Marah, the Great Sea), reflectedthrough Chesed into Hod, under the presidency of Mem, the Mother of Watei. InChokmah is the Root of Fire, reflected downwards through Geburah into Netzach,under the presidency of Shin, the Mother of Fire.25. These groupings must be borne in mind, for they aid greatly in understandingthe significance of individual Sephiroth, for, as we have already pointed out invarious connections, a Sephirah is best interpreted by its affiliations.CHAPTER IXTHE TEN SEPHIROTH IN THE FOUR WORLDSI. We have already noted the division of the Sep hiroth into the Four Worlds ofthe Qabalists, for this is one of the methods of classification much employed inQabalistic thought and of great value when studying evolution. We must remember,however, that the Tree is not an arbitrary method of classification, and becausea thing is classified under one head in one system it does not mean that itcannot equally properly be classified under another head in another system. Thereappearance of the same symbol in a different Sphere often affords valuableclues.2. Under another method of classification the Ten Holy Sephiroth are consideredas appearing in each Qabalistic World upon another arc or level ofmanifestation; so that just as Am Soph Aur, the Limitless Light of theUnmanifest, concentrated a point, which was Kether, and the emanations workeddown through increasing grades of density to Malkuth, so the Malkuth of Atziluthis conceived of as giving rise to the Kether of Briah, Mystical Qabala Page 42and so on consecutively down the planes, the Malkuth of Briah giving rise to theKether of Yetzirah, the Malkuth of Yetzirah giving rise to the Kether of Assiah,and the Malkuth of Assiah, in its lowest aspect, abutting upon the Qliphoth.3. It is Atziluth, however, which is considered the natural sphere of theSephiroth as such, and for this reason it is called the World of Emanations. Itis here, and here only, that God acts directly and not through His ministers. InBriah He acts through the mediation of the Archangels, in Yetzirah through theAngelic Orders, and in Assiah through those centres which I have named theMundane Chakras-the planets, elements, and signs of the Zodiac.[Page 62]4. We have, then, in these four sets of symbols a complete system of notationfor expressing the mode of function of any given power at any given level, andthis system of notation is the basis of ceremonial magic with its Names ofPower, and also of talismanic magic and the Tarot system of divination. It isfor this reason that it is said of the\"barbarous names of evocation\" that not so much as a letter may be changed, forthese names are formulae based on the Hebrew alphabet, which is the sacredlanguage of the West as Sanskrit is the sacred language of the East. In Hebrew,moreover, each letter is also a number, so the Names are numerical formulae; amost intricate system of metaphysical mathematics, called Gematria, is based onthis principle. There are aspects of Gematria which I, at the present stage ofmy knowledge at any rate, consider debased and idle, being the accretions ofsuperstition, but the basic idea of the system of cosmic mathematicsunquestionably enshrines great truths and contains great possibilities. Usingthis system, it is possible to unravel the relationships of all manner of cosmicfactors if the correct Hebrew spelling of the Names of Power is known, for theseNames were formulated in accordance with the principles of Gematria, andtherefore Gematria supplies the key to them. But this aspect of our subject,fascinating as it is, we cannot enter upon now.5. In the Archetypal World of Atziluth there are assigned to the Ten Sephirothten forms of the Divine Name. Anyone who has read the Bible cannot fail to haveobserved that God is referred to under divers titles, as the Lord, as the LordGod, as the Father, and by several other appellations. Now these are notliterary devices to avoid needless repetition, but are exact metaphysical terms,and according to the Name used we know the aspect of Divine force in questionand the plane on which it is functioning.6. In the world of Briah it is held that the mighty Archangels carry out themandates of God and give them expression, and assigned to the SephirothicSpheres on the Tree in this World are the names of these ten mighty spirits.[Page 64]Mystical Qabala Page 437. In Yetzirah it is the choirs of angels, innumerable in their concourse, whocarry out the Divine commands; and these also are assigned to their SephirothicSpheres, thus enabling us to know their mode and level of function.8. In Assiah, as we have already noted, certain natural centres of force aregiven similar correspondences. We will consider all these associations when wecome to study the Sephiroth in detail.9. In the symbolic rendering of the Ten Holy Sephiroth in the Four Worlds thereis another important set of factors to be considered, and these are the fourcolour scales classified by Crowley as the King scale, assigned to theAtziluthic World; the Queen scale, assigned to the Briatic World; the Emperorscale, assigned to the Yetziratic World; and the Empress scale, assigned to theAssiatic World.10. This fourfold classification has a far-reaching significance in allQabalistic matters, and also in Western magic, which is largely based upon theQabalab. It is said to be under the presidency of the Four Letters ofTetragrammaton, the Sacred Name popularly rendered as Jehovah. In Hebrew, whichhas no vowels in its alphabet, this word is spelt JHVH, or, according to theHebrew names of these letters, Yod, He', Vau, He'. The vowels are indicated inHebrew by points inserted in and under the square letters of the script, whichis written from right to left. These vowel-points were only introduced at acomparatively recent date, and the older Hebrew scripts are unpointed so thatthe reader cannot see the pronunciation of any proper name for himself, butneeds to have it communicated to him by someone who knows it. The true mysticalpronunciation of the Tetragrammaton is said to be one of the arcana of theMysteries.11. To the Four Letters of the Name are allotted any fourfold mysticalclassification, and by means of their correspondences we can trace all manner ofrelationships, and these are very important in practical occultism, as will beseen later.12. Four important fourfold divisions find a place under them, thus enabling usto see their relationships among themselves. These are the Four Worlds of theQabalists; the four elements of the alchemists; the fourfold classification ofthe signs of the Zodiac and the planets into triplicities, employed by theastrologers; and the four suits of the Tarot pack used in divination. Thisfourfold classification resembles the Rosetta Stone which gave the key to theEgyptian hieroglyphs, for on it were inscriptions in Egyptian and Greek; Greekbeing known, it was possible to work out the meaning of the correspondingEgyptian hieroglyphs. It is the method of arranging all these sets of factors onthe Tree which gives the real esoteric clue to each of these systems ofpractical occultism. Without this key they have no philosophical basis andbecome matters of rule of thumb and superstition. It is for this reason that theinitiated occultist will have nothing to do with the uninitiated fortune-teller,for he knows that, lacking this key, his system is valueless.Hence the vital importance of the Tree in Western occultism. It is our basis,our standard of measurement, and our textbook.Mystical Qabala Page 4413. To understand a Sephirah, then, we need to know firstly its primarycorrespondences in the Four Worlds; its secondary correspondences in the foursystems of practical occultism mentioned above; and, thirdly, any othercorrespondences we can by any means gather together, in order that the testimonyof many witnesses may yield the truth.Of this gathering of correspondences there can be no end, for the whole cosmoson all its planes corresponds in endless sequences. We are constantly adding toour knowledge if we are good students of occult science. No better simile thanthat of the card-index system could possibly have been found.14. But yet again we must remind the reader in this connection that the Qabalahis as much a method of using the mind as a system of knowledge. If we have theknowledge without having acquired the Qabalistic technique of mentation, it isof little use to us. In fact, we might go so far as to say that itis notpossible to acquire any great degree of knowledge until this technique of themind has been mastered; for it is not the[Page 66]conscious mind to which the Tree appeals, but subconsciousness, for the logicalmethod of the Qabalah is the logical method of dream association; but in thecase of the Qabalah the dreamer is the racial subconsciousness, the oversoul ofthe peoples, the Earth-spirit.Into communion with this Earth-soul the adept enters by means of meditation onthe prescribed symbols. This is the real import of the Tree and its correspondences.15. The highest of the Four Worlds, Atziluth, the plane of pure Deity, is calledby the Qabalists the Archetypal World. It is also called, in the somewhat clumsytranslation of MacGregor Mathers, the Intellectual World. This term ismisleading. It is only intellectual as we commonly understand the word asrelating to the mind, the rational intellect, in so far as it is the realm ofarchetypal ideas. But these ideas are entirely abstract, and are conceived by afunction of consciousness quite outside the range of mind as we know it.Therefore to call this level the Intellectual World is to mislead the reader,unless at the same time we say that by intellect we mean something quitedifferent to what the dictionary means. This is a poor way of expressing ourideas. It is far better to coin a new term with a precise meaning than to use anold one in a misleadihg sense, especially as, in the case of Atziluth, there isan excellent term already current, the term Archetypal, which exactly describesit.16. The Atziluthic World is said by the Qabalists to be under the presidency ofthe Yod of the Sacred Name of Tetragrammaton. We may justly deduce from thisthat in any other fourfold system whatever is said to be also under thepresidency of Yod will refer to the Atziluthic, or purely spiritual aspect ofthat force or subject. Among other associations given by different authoritiesare the Wands suit of the Tarot pack and the Element of Fire. It will beapparent to anyone who has any knowledge of occult matters that as soon as weknow the element to which a symbol is assigned, we know a good deal, for itopens up all the ramifications of astrology for us, and we can trace out itsastrological affinities through the triplicities of the Zodiac and theaffinities of the planets with thern. As soon as we know what Zodiacal andplanetary associations exist, we are in a position to Mystical Qabala Page 45explore the correlated symbolism of any pantheon, for all the gods and goddessesof ah the systems that the human mind has ever invented have astrologicalassociations. The stories of their adventures are really parables of theworkings of cosmic forces. Through this maze of symbolism we could never hope tofind our way unaided, but if we anchor the end of each chain of correspondencesto its Sephirah, we have the clue we need.17. All systems of esoteric thought, as well as all popular theologies,attribute the construction and presidency of the different parts of themanifested universe to the mediation of intelligent and purposive beings,working under the instruction of Deity.Modern thought has tried to escape from the implications of this concept byreducing manifestation to a matter of mechanics; it has not succeeded, and thereare signs that it is not far from the point when it will perceive mind as beingat the root of form.18. The concepts of the Ancient Wisdom may be crude from the standpoint ofmodern philosophy, but we are forced to admit that the causative force behindmanifestation is more akin in its nature to mind than to matter. To go a stepfurther and personify the different types of force is a legitimate analogy,provided we realise that the entity which is the soul of the force may differ asmuch in kind and degree from our minds as our bodies differ in type and scalefrom the bodies of the planets. We shall be nearer an understanding of nature ifwe look for mind in the background than if we refuse to admit that the visibleuniverse has an invisible framework. The ether of the physicists is closer akinto mind than to matter; time and space, as understood by the modern philosopher,are more like modes of consciousness than linear measures.19. The initiates of the Ancient Wisdom made no bones about their philosophy;they took each factor in Nature and personified it, gave it a name, and built upa symbolic figure[Page 68]to represent it, just as British artists have by their collective effortsproduced a standard Britannia, a female figure with shield charged with theUnion Jack, a lion at her feet, a trident in her hand, a helmet on her head, andthe sea in the back ground. Analysing this figure as we would a Qabalisticsymbol, we realise that these individual symbols in the complex glyph have eacha significance. The various crosses which make up the Union Jack refer to thefour races united in the United Kingdom. The helmet is that of Minerva, thetrident is that of Neptune; the lion would need a chapter to himself toelucidate his symbolism. In fact, an occult glyph is more akin to a coat of armsthan anything else, and the person who builds up a glyph goes to work in thesame way as a herald designing a coat of arms. For in heraldry every symbol hasits exact meaning, and these are combined into the coat of arms that representsthe family and affiliations of the man who bears it, and tells us his station inlife. A magical figure is the coat of arms of the force it represents.20. These magical figures are built up to represent the different modes of themanifestation of cosmic force in its different types and on its differentlevels. They are given names, and the initiate thinks of them as persons, nottroubling himself about their Mystical Qabala Page 46metaphysical foundations. Consequently, for all practical purposes they arepersons, for whatever they may be in actual fact, they have been personalised,and thought-forms have been built up on the astral plane to represent them.These, being charged with force, are of the nature of artificial elementals; butthe force with which they are charged being cosmic, they are much more than whatwe ordinarily imply when we speak of artificial elementals, and we assign themto the angelic kingdom and call them angels or archangels according to theirgrade. An angelic being, then, may be defined as a cosmic force whose apparentvehicle of manifestation to psychic consciousness is a form built up by thehuman imagination. In practical occultism, these forms are built up with greatcare and the most elaborate attention to the details of the symbolism, and areused to evoke the force[Page 69]required; anyone who has had experience of their use will agree that they arepeculiarly effectual for the purposes for which they are designed. By holdingthe magical image in it and vibrating the traditional name assigned thereto,remarkable phenomena are obtained.21. As we have already noted, it is necessary to use the rnental technique ofthe Qabalists in order to get any sense out of the Qabalah; this formulation ofthe image and vibration of the name is designed to put the student in touch withthe forces behind each Sphere of the Tree, and when he comes into touch in thisway his consciousness is illuminated and his nature energised by the force thuscontacted, and he obtains remarkable illuminations from his contemplation of thesymbols. These illuminations are not a generalised flooding of light, as in thecase of the Christian mystic, but a specific energising and illuminationaccording to the Sphere opened up; Hod gives understanding of sciences, Yesodunderstanding of life-force and its tidal modes of functioning. When Hod iscontacted we become filled with enthusiasm and energy for research; when Yesodis contacted we enter deeply into psychic consciousness and touch the hiddenlife-forces of the earth and our own natures. These are matters of experience;those who have used the method know what it yields them. Whatever may be therational foundations of the system, as an empirical method it yields results.22. If we want to study a Sephirah-in other words, if we want to investigate theaspect of Nature to which it refers-we not only study it intellectually andme~tate upon it, but we try to get into psychic and intuitive touch with itsinfluence and Sphere. In order to accomplish this, we always start at the topand try to get into spiritual touch with the aspect of Deity which emanated thatSphere and manifests in it. If this is not done, the forces belonging to theSphere on the elemental levels may get out of hand and cause difficulties.Starting under the presidency of the Divine Name, however, no evil can enter.23. Having adored the Creator and Sustainer of All under[Page 70]Mystical Qabala Page 47His Holy Name in the Sphere we are investigating, we next invoke the Archangelof the Sphere, the mighty spi ritual being in whom we personify the forces thatbuilt up that level of evolution and continue to function in the correspondingaspect of Nature. We ask the blessing of the Archangel, and beg that he will bidthe Order of Angels assigned to that Sphere that they shall be friendly andhelpful towards us in the realm of nature in which they function. By the time wehave done this, we shall be thoroughly tuned to the keynote of the Sphere we areinvestigating, and be ready to follow out the ramifications of thecorrespondences of that Sephirah and its cognate symbols.24. Approached in this way, we shall find the association~ chains far richer insymbolism than we have ever believed to be possible, for the subconscious mindhas been stirred and one of its many chambers of imagery thrown open, to theexclusion of all the others. The association-chains that rise into consciousnessshould therefore be free from any admixture of extraneous ideas and true totype.25. First we review in our minds all the possible symbols that we can recollect,and as these present themselves to consciousness we try and see their import andbearing upon the secrets of the Sphere under investigation. But we do not trytoo hard; for if we concentrate upon a symbol and strain at it, as it were, weshall close the meshes of the tenuous veil that shields the subconscious mind.In these investigations, half meditation, half reverie, we want to work on theborders of consciousness and subconsciousness so as to induce that which issubconscious to cross the threshold and come within our reach.26. As we proceed thus, following out the ramifications of theassociation-chains, we shall find that a running comment of intuitionaccompanies the process, and after the experiment has been repeated two or threetimes we shall feel that we know that Sephirah in a peculiarly intimate way,that we feel at home there, that the feel of it is quite different to that ofthe other Sephiroth which we have not yet worked with.[Page 71]We shall also find that some Sephiroth are more congenial to us than others, andthat we get better results when working with them than we do with theuncongenial ones, where the associations-chains keep on breaking and the doorsof subconsciousness resolutely refuse to open to our knocking. One pupil of minecould do excellent meditations on Binah Saturn, and Tiphareth, the Redeemer, butdid not get on at all well with Geburah-Severity-Mars.27. I shall never forget my own experience with the first attempt I made at thismethod. I was working on the Thirty-second Path, the Path of Saturn, unitingMalkuth and Yesod, a very difficult and treacherous Path. In my horoscope Saturnis not well aspected, and I have often experienced his opp9sing influence in myaffairs. But after I had succeeded in treading the Path of Saturn out into theindigo darkness of the Unseen until the Moon of Yesod rose in purple and silverover the horizon, I felt that I had received the initiation of Saturn, that hewas no longer inimical to me, but a friend who, though candid and stern, was tobe trusted to protect me from mistakes and rash judgments. I realised hisfunction Mystical Qabala Page 48as the tester, and not the antagonist or avenger. I realised him as Time withhis scythe, but knew also why he was called in Hebrew Shabbathal, rest, \"for hegiveth his beloved sleep.\" After that, the Thirty-second Path was open to me,not only on the Tree, but in life, for the forces and problems symbolised bythat Path and its correspondences had become harmonised in my soul. From thesetwo brief examples it will be seen that the meditations upon the Tree form amost practical and exact system of mystical development; and one that ispeculiarly valuable in that it is equilibrated, for the different aspects ofmanifestation are, as it were, dissected out and dealt with in turn, nothingbeing neglected. By the time we have trodden all the Paths of the Tree we shallhave learnt the lessons of Death and the Devil, as well as of the Angel and theHigh Priest.CHAPTER XTHE PATHS UPON THE TREE1. The Sepher Yetzirah refers to the Ten Sephiroth theni selves, as well as thelines connecting them, as Paths, and justly so, for they are all equallychannels of Divine influence; but it is usual in practical working to considerthe lines between the Sephiroth only as the Paths, and the Sephiroth themselvesas Spheres upon the Tree. This is one of the many tricks and blinds to be foundin the Qabalistic system, for if we think of the Paths as thirty-two in number,as they are given in the Sepher Yetzirah, we shall not be able to equate themwith the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet which, with their numericalvalue and correspondences, form the key to the Paths.2. Each Path is said to represent the equilibrium of the two Sephiroth itconnects, and we have to study it in the light of our knowledge of theseSephiroth if we are to appreciate its significance. Certain symbols are alsoassigned to the Paths themselves. These are, as already noted, the twenty-twoletters of the Hebrew alphabet; the signs of the Zodiac, the planets, and theelements. Now there are twelve signs in the Zodiac, seven planets, and fourelements, making in all twenty-three symbols. How are these to be arranged onTwenty-two Paths? Here is another Qabalistic blind to puzzle the uninitiated.The answer is quite simple when it is known. Our consciousness being in theelement of Earth, we do not need the symbol of earth in our calculations when wemake contact with the Unseen, so we leave it out and then find ourselves withthe correct set of correspondences.Malkuth is all the earth we need for practical purposes.[Page 72]The third set of symbols to go upon the Paths are the twenty-two trumps or majorarcana of the Tarot pack. With these three sets of symbols and the colours ofthe four colour scales, our major symbolism is complete; the minor symbolismconsists of the innumerable ramifications of the correspondences through allsystems and planes.Mystical Qabala Page 494. The Tree of Life, astrology, and the Tarot are not three mystical systems,but three aspects of one and the same system, and each is unintelligible withoutthe others. It is only when we study astrology on the basis of the Tree that wehave a philosophical system; equally does this apply to the Tarot system ofdivination, and the Tarot itself, with its comprehensive interpretations, givesthe key to the Tree as applied to human life.5. Astrology is so elusive because the uninitiated astrologer works on one planeonly; but the initiated astrologer, with the Tree as his ground-plan, interpretson the four planes of the Four Worlds, and the effect of, shall we say, Saturn,is very different in Atziluth, where it is the Divine Mother, Binah, to what itis in Assiah.6. All systems of divination and all systems of practical magic find theirprinciples and philosophy based upon the Tree; whoever tries to use them withoutthis key is like the foolhardy person who has a pharmacopoeia of patentmedicines and doses himself and his friends according to the descriptions givenin the advertisements, wherein backache includes every disease which does notcause pain in front. The initiate who knows his Tree is like the scientificphysician who understands the principles of physiology and the chemistry ofdrugs, and prescribes accordingly.7. Various methods of attributing the Tarot cards have been worked out fromtraditional sources. In his little book, The Key to the Tarot, A. E. Waite givesthe chief of these; but refrains from indicating which, in his opinion, is thecorrect one. In his valuable tabulation of esoteric symbolism, \"777,\" Crowleyhas no such reticence, but gives the system as it is known among initiates. Thisis the method I propose to[Page 74]follow in these pages, for I believe it to be the correct because thecorrespondences work out without discrepancies, a thing they do in none of theother systems.8. According to this system, the four suits of the Tarot pack are assigned tothe Four Worlds of the Qabalists and the four elements of the Alchemists. Thesuit of Wands is assigned to Atziluth and Fire. The suit of Cups to Briah andWater. The suit of Swords to Yetzirah and Air. The suit of Pentacles or Coins toAssiah and Earth.9. The four aces are assigned to Kether, the first Sephirah; the four twos toChokmah, the second Sephirah; and so on down the pack. the four tens beingassigned to Malkuth. It will thus be seen that the cards of the four suits ofthe Tarot pack represent the action of the Divine Forces in each sphere and oneach level of nature. Equally, if we know the significance of the Tarot cards weshall obtain much light on the nature of the Paths and Spheres to which they areassigned. Both these systems, the Tarot and the Tree, being of immemorialantiquity, their origins lost in the vistas of the ages, there is an enormousmass of symbolic correspondences accumulated around each of them. Everypractical occultist who has ever worked with the Tree has added to this stock ofassociations, making the symbols live in the Astral by means of his operations.The Tree and its keys are infinite in their adaptability.Mystical Qabala Page 5010. The four court-cards of the Tarot are called in modern packs, King, Queen,Knight, and Knave; but in the traditional packs they are, according to Crowley,arranged and symbolised differently. The King, being a mounted figure,indicating the swift action of the Yod of Tetragrammaton; the Prince of theesoteric Tarot is a seated figure, corresponding to the Vau of Tetragrammaton;and the Princess, the Knave of the modern packs, correspond to the Hé final ofthe Sacred Name.11. The twenty-two trumps are arranged in various ways by various authorities,of which Mr. Waite gives a selection, but in our system we will follow the ordergiven by Crowley for reasons already discussed.12. In these pages we propose to give the philosophical Tree of Life, and enoughpractical instruction to render it available for meditation purposes; but we donot propose to give the Practical Qabalah, which is used for magical purposes;because that can only properly be learnt and safely practised in a Temple of theMysteries. Reference must be made to the Practical Qabalah, however, in order torender some of the concepts intelligible, but those who are rightfully inpossession of its keys need have no fear that these keys will be revealed to theuninitiated in these pages, for I am quite alive to the consequences of sodoing.13. If, from the information here given, and as a result of pursuing the methodsdescribed herein, anyone is able to work out for himself the keys of thePractical Qabalah, as he well may, can any dispute that he is entitled to them?14. The Tree is enormously valuable as a meditation glyph, quite apart from itsuse in magic. By meditation such as I have described in my account of my ownexperiences on the Thirty-second Path, it is possible to equilibrate the warringelements in one's own nature and bring them into harmonious balance. It is alsopossible to get into sympathetic rapport with the different aspects of Naturewhich these symbols represent when applied to the Macrocosm, even if theseforces are not given a definite form in talismanic magic.The information that is obtained from the study of one's own horoscope is not tobe accepted pasively as the dispensation of Fate from which there is no appeal.We ought to realise that talismanic magic, or the less concentrated method ofmeditation upon the Tree, should be used to compensate all unbalanced force inthe horoscope and bring all into equilibrium. Talismanic magic is to astrologywhat medical treatment is to medical diagnosis.15. It is not possible for me to give any formulae of practical[Page 76]magic here; before such formulae can be made use of it is necessary to havereceived the grades of initiation to Which they belong. Without these grades thestudent is no better off than the person who tries to diagnose and treat his owncomplaints after reading a medical textbook. That delightful humorist, Jerome K.Jerome, has told us what happens in such a case. The unfortunate imagines thathe has every disease described therein, Mystical Qabala Page 51except housemaid's knee, and cannot make up his mind as to the appropriatetreatment, for everything he fancies is contra-indicated.16. The ritual initiations of the Greater Mysteries of the Western EsotericTraditioh are based upon the principles of the Tree of Life. Each gradecorresponds to a Sephirah and confers, or should confer, if the Order workingthem is worthy of the name, the powers of that sphere of nature. Likewise itopens up the Paths leading to that Sephirah, so that the initiate is said to beLord of the Thirty-second Path when he has taken the initiation that correspondsto Yesod, or Lord of the Twenty-fourth, Twenty-fifth, and Twenty-sixth Pathswhen he has taken the initiation corresponding to Tiphareth, which constituteshim a full initiate. Beyond this lie the higher grades of adepthood."},{"pageContent":"17. The aim of each grade of initiation of the Greater Mysteries is to introducethe candidate to the Sphere of each Sephirah in turn, working from Malkuth upthe Tree. The instructions given in each grade concern the symbolism and forcesof the Sphere to which it refers and the Paths that equilibrate it. The sign andword of the grade are used when treading these Paths in the spirit-vision orprojecting by them on the astral plane.Consequently the initiate is able to move with accuracy and certainty intowhatsoever sphere of the Unseen he desires to penetrate, and to countercheck aHbeings he meets and all visions he sees, for he knows what the colours of thePaths are in all four scales, and he checks his vision by these. If he isworking up the Thirty-second path of Saturn, whose colours are all in the scmbrehues of indigo, dark blue and black, he knows that something is amiss if ascarlet-robed figure presents itself. Either that figure is illusive, or hehimself has wandered off the Path.18. To project the astral body along the Paths it is necessary for many reasonsto hold the degrees of initiation to which they correspond; chief among which isthat, unless one has received the grade, one will be unknown to guardians of thePaths, and they will be inimical rather than helpful, and do all in their powerto turn the wanderer back.Secondly, if one should succeed in forcing one's way past the guardian, onestill has no means of counterchecking the vision or knowing whether one is on oroff the Path, and there are plenty of beings in the lower sphere who are onlytoo ready to take advantage of presumptuous ignorance.19. These considerations, however, need in no way discourage anyone who wishesto meditate upon the Paths and Spheres in the manner I have described; and inthe course of his meditations he may so enter into the spirit of the Path thatits guardian shall come to know him and make him welcome. He will then literallyhave initiated himself, and no one can deny his right to be there.20. The Tree, considered from the initiatory standpoint, is the link between themicrocosm, which is man, and the Macrocosm, which is God made manifest inNature. A ritual initiation is the act of linking the microcosmic Sephirah, thechakra, with the Macrocosmic Sephirah; it is the introduction of a newcomer tothe Sphere by those who are already there. They construct a symbolicrepresentation of the Sphere on the physical plane in the furniture of thetemple; they construct an astral replica of it by concentrated Mystical QabalaPage 52imagination; and by means of invocation they call down into this temple not madewith hands the forces of the Sphere of the Sephirah they are working upon.21. These forces stimulate the corresponding chakras of the initiate and wakethem to activity in his aura. The process of self-mitiation by the meditations Ihave described is slower than the processes of ritual initiation, but it is sureenough if Persevered with by a suitable person, but one cannot teach ajelly-fish to sing by feeding it on canary-seed.CHAPTER XITHE SUBJECTIVE SEPHIROTH1. As above, so below, man is a miniature macrocosm. All the factors that go tothe make-up of the manifested universe are present in his nature. Hence, in hisperfection, he is said to be higher than the angels. At the present time,however, the angels are fully evolved beings and man is not. Thus he is as muchlower than the angels as a three-year-old child is less developed than athree-year-old dog.2. Hitherto we have considered the Tree of Life as an epitome of the Macrocosm,the universe, and the use of its symbols to put us in touch with the differentspheres of objective Nature. We will now consider it in relation to thesubjective sphere of the nature of the individual.3. The accepted correspondences, as given by Crowley (who, unfortunately, nevergives his authorities, so we do not know when he is using MacGregor Mathers'system and when he is relying upon his independent researches), are based partlyon the astrological attribution of the planets assigned to the differentSephiroth, and partly upon a crude anatomical scheme of the human form standingwith its back to the Tree. This is too crude for our purposes, and probablyrepresents the work of later generations of scribes; during the Middle Ages theQabalah was rediscovered by European philosophers, and they grafted astrologicaland aichernical symbolism upon its system. Moreover, the Rabbis themselves usedan extremely detailed set of anatomical metaphors, discussing in detail thesignificance of every hair on the head of God, and even the more intimate partsof His anatomy. Such references cannot be taken literally and applied to thehuman form.[Page 78]4. The Sephiroth, individually and in their pattern of relationships, representin relation to the Macrocosm the successive phases of evolution, and in relationto the Microcosm the different levels of consciousness and factors of character.That these levels of consciousness have some relation to the psychic centres ofthe physical body is a reasonable assumption, but we must not be crude andmediaeval in the conclusions we draw. Occult anatomy and physiology have beenworked out in detail in the Yoga science of the Hindus, and we can learn muchfrom their teachings. The latest advances in Mystical Qabala Page 53physiology are pointing to the conclusion that the link between mind and matteris to be sought primarily in the endocrine system of ductless glands and onlysecondarily in the brain and central nervous system. We can learn much from thissource of knowledge also, and piecing together all the information we cancollect from every source, we may finally arrive by inductive reasoning at whatthe ancients learnt by means of the intuitive and deductive methods which theybrought to such a high degree of perfection in their Mystery schools.5. It is generally agreed that the chakras, or psychic centres described in Yogaliterature, are not situated inside the organs with which they are associated,but in the auric envelope at spots roughly approximating thereto. We shall dowell, therefore, not to associate the different Sephiroth with the limbs andother parts of our anatomy, but to regard the use of such analogies asmetaphorical and look for the psychic principles which they may be held torepresent.6. Before proceeding to a detailed study of each Sephirah from this standpoint,it is very helpful to have a general survey of the Tree as a whole, because somuch of the elucidation of the symbolism depends upon the relationship of onesymbol to another in the pattern of the Tree. This chapter must needs bediscursive and inconclusive, but it will enable the detailed study of theindividual Sephiroth to be much more effectually carried out.7. The first and most obvious division of the Tree is into[Page 80]the three Pillars, and this immediately reminds us of the three channels ofPrana described by the yogis, Ida, Pingala, and Shushumna; and the twoprinciples, the Yin and the Yang of Chinese philosophy, and the Tao, or Way,which is the equilibrium between them. By the agreement of witnesses truth isestablished, and when we find three of the great metaphysical systems of theworld in complete agreement - we may conclude that we are dealing withestablished principles and should accept them as such.8. The Central Pillar should, in my opinion, be taken to representconsciousness, and the two side pillars as the Positive and negative factors ofmanifestation. It is noteworthy that in the Yoga system consciousness isextended when Kundalini rises through the central channel of the Shushumna, andthat the Western magical operation of Rising on the Planes takes place up theCentral Pillar of the Tree; that is to say, the symbolism employed to inducethis extension of consciousness does not take the Sephiroth in their numericalorder, commencing with Malkuth, but goes from Malkuth to Yesod, and Yesod toTiphareth, by what is called the Path of the Arrow.9. Malkuth, the Sphere of Earth, is taken by occultists as signifyingbrain-consciousness, as is proved by the fact that after any astral projectionthe ceremonial return is made to Malkuth and normal consciousness re-establishedtherein.Mystical Qabala Page 5410. Yesod, the Sphere of Levanah, the Moon, is taken as psychic consciousness,and also as the reproductive centre. Tiphareth is taken as the higher psychism,the true illuminated vision, and is associated with the highest grade of theinitiation of the personality, as is evidenced by the fact that to it isassigned, in the system taken by Crowley from Mathers, the first of the gradesof adepthood.11. Daath, the mysterious, invisible Sephirah, which is never marked upon theTree, is associated in the Western svstem with the nape of the neck, the pointwhere the spine meets the skull, the spot at which the development of the brainfrom the notochord took place in our primeval ancestors.Daath is usually held to represent the consciousness of another dimension, orthe consciousness of another level or plane; it essentially represents the ideaof change of key.12. Kether is called the Crown. Now a crown is above the head, and Kether isgenerally held to represent a form of consciousness which is not achieved duringincarnation. It is essentially outside the scheme of things so far as the planesof form are concerned. The spiritual experience associated with Kether is Unionwith God, and whoso achieves that experience is said to enter into the Light andcome not forth again.13. These Sephiroth unquestionably have their correlations in the chakras of theHindu system, but the correspondences are given differently by differentauthorities. As the method of classification is different, the West using afourfold system and the East a sevenfold system, correlation is not easy toobtain, and in my opinion it is better to look for first principles rather thanobtain a tidy pattern of arrangement which does violence to the correspondences.14. The only two writers known to me who have attempted this correlation areCrowley and General J. F. C. Fuller. General Fuller assigns the Muladhara Lotusto Malkuth, pointing out that its four petals correspond with the four elements.It is interesting to note that in the Queen scale of colour, as given byCrowley, the Sphere of Malkuth is represented as divided into four quarters,coloured respectively citrine, olive, russet, and black, to represent the fourelements, and bearing the closest resemblance to the usual representations ofthe Four-petalled Lotus.15. This Lotus is represented as situated in the perineum and is associated withthe anus and the function of excretion. In column XXI of the table ofcorrespondences given by Crowley in ~ he attributes the buttocks and anus of thePerfected Man to Malkuth. I consider that from every point of view theattribution of Fuller, who refers the Muladhara Lotus to Malkuth, is to bepreferred to that of Crowley, who in column CXVIII refers it to Yesod, thuscontradicting[Page 82]Mystical Qabala Page 55himself. In the infantile mind, according to Freud, the functions ofreproduction and excretion are confused, but I don't consider that thisattribution is one that can be generally accepted or ought to be perpetuated.16. Malkuth, viewed as the Muladhara Lotus, represents, we may take it, theend-result of the life processes, their final concretion in form, and theirsubmission to the disintegrating influences of death in order that theirsubstance may be utilised again. The form into which they have been organised bythe slow processes of evolution has served its purpose, and the force must beset free; this is the spiritual significance of the processes of excretion,putrefaction, and decomposition, 17. The Svadisthana Chakra, the Six-petalledLotus, at the base of the generative organs, is assigned by General Fuller toYesod. This agrees with the Western tradition, which assigns Yesod to thereproductive organs of the Divine Man; its astrological correspondence with theMoon, Diana-Hecate, also agrees with this attribution. Crowley, though assigningYesod to the phallus in column XXI of \"777,\" assigns the Svadisthana Lotus toHod, Mercury. It is difficult to understand this attribution, and as he does notgive his authority, I consider it better to adhere to the principle of referringthe levels of consciousness to the Central Pillar.18. Tiphareth, by universal consent, represents the solar plexus and breast; ittherefore seems reasonable to attribute to it the Manipura and Anahata Chakras,as Crowley does.Fuller attributes these chakras to Geburah and Chesed, but as these twoSephiroth find their equilibrium in Tiphareth, this attribution presents nodifficulty and causes no discrepancy.19. In the same way the Visuddhu Chakra, which in the Hindu system correlateswith the larynx and is referred to Binah by Crowley, and the Ajna Chakra at theroot of the nose, which correlates with the pineal gland and is referred toChokmah by the same authority, may be taken as uniting for function in Daath,situated at the base of the skull.20. The Sahasrara Chakra, the Thousand-petalled Lotus, situated above the head,is referred by Crowley to Kether, and there can be little reason to quarrel withthis attribution, for it is foreshadowed in the very name of the First Path,Kether, the Crown, which rests upon and above the head.21. The two flanking pillars of Severity and Mercy can be seen as representingthe positive and negativeprinciples- and their respective Sephiroth as representing the modes offunctioning of these forces upon the different levels.22. The Pillar of Severity contains Binah, Geburah, and Hod, or Saturn, Mars,and Mercury. The Pillar of Mercy contains Chokmah, Chesed, and Netzach, or theZodiac, Jupiter, and Venus. Chokmah and Binab, in the symbolism of the Qabalah,are represented by male and female figures and are the supernal Father andMother, or in Mystical Qabala Page 56more philosophical language, the positive and negative principles of theuniverse, the Yin and the Yang, of which maleness and femaleness are butspecialised aspects.23. Chesed (Jupiter) and Geburah (Mars) are both represented in Qabalisticsymbolism as crowned figures, the former a lawgiver upon his throne, and thelatter a warrior king in his chariot. These are the constructive and destructiveprinciples respectively. It is interesting to note that Binah, the supernalMother, is also Saturn, the solidifier, who connects through his sickle withDeath with his scythe, and Time with his hour-glass. In Binah we find the rootof Form. It is said of Malkuth in the Sepher Yetzirah that it sitteth upon thethrone of Binah-matter has its root in Binah-Saturn Death; form is the destroyerof force. With this passive destroyer goes also the active destroyer, and wefind MarsGeburah immediately below it on the Pillar of Severity; thus is theforce locked up in form set free by the destructive influence of Mars, the Sivaaspect of the Godhead.Chokmah, the Zodiac, represents kinetic force; and Chesed, Jupiter, the benignking, represents organised force; and the two are synthesised in Tiphareth, theChrist-centre, the Redeemer and Equilibrator.24. The next trinity, of Netzach, Hod, and Yesod, represents the magical andastral side of things. Netzach (Venus)[Page 84]represents the higher aspects of the elemental forces, the Green Ray; and Hod(Mercury) represents the mind side of magic. The one is the mystic and the otherthe occult, and they synthesise in the elemental Yesod. This pair of Sephirothshould never be considered apart, any more than the upper pair of Geburah andGedulah, which is another name for Chesed. This is indicated by the fact thatthe Qabalah attributes thern respectively to the right and left arms and theleft and right legs.25. It will thus be seen that the three form-Sephiroth are in the Pillar ofSeverity, and the three force-Sephiroth in the Pillar of Mercy, and betweenthem, in the Pillar of Equilibrium, are set the different levels ofconsciousness. The Pillar of Severity, with Binah at its head, is the femaleprinciple, the Pingala of the Hindus and the Yang of the Chinese; the Pillar ofMercy, with Chokmah at its head, is the Ida of the Hindus and the Yin of theChinese; and the Pillar of Equilibrium is Shushumna and Tao.CHAPTER XIITHE GODS UPON THE TREE1. All students of comparative religion and its poor relation, folk-lore, areagreed that primitive man, observing and beginning to analyse the naturalphenomena surrounding him, attributed them to the agency of beings akin tohimself in nature and type, but transcending him in power. As he could not seethem, he not unnaturally called them Mystical Qabala Page 57invisible; and as he could not see his own mind during life, or his friend'ssoul after death, he concluded that the beings that produced natural phenomenawere of the same nature as the invisible but active mind and soul.2. Now all this sounds very crude as it is put by the anthropologists, but thatis only because when translating savage ideas they choose words that have crudeassociatiohs.For instance, the standard translation of one of the chief scriptures of Chinarefers to the venerable philosopher Lao Tse as \"the Old Boy.\" This soundscomical to European ears, yet it is not so far removed from the words of anotherScripture which has been fortunate enough to receive translation at the hands ofthose who reverenced it-\" Except ye become as a little child\" I am not asinologue, but I incline to the opinion that the translation\"Eternal Child\" would have been equally accurate and in better taste.3. There is a saying in the Mysteries, \"See that ye blaspheme not the Name bywhich another knoweth his God. For if ye do this in Allah, ye will do it inAdonai.\"4. And after all, was primitive man so very far off the mark when he attributedthe causation of natural phenomena to activities of the same nature as thethought-processes of the[Page 86]human mind, but upon a higher arc? Is not that the Point towards which bothphysics and metaphysics are gradually converging? Supposing we were to re-castthe statement of the savage philosopher and say, The essential nature of man issimilar in type to that of his Creator, would we be held to have said anythingeither blasphemous or ridiculous?5. We may personalise natural forces in terms of human consciousness; or we mayabstract human consciousness in terms of natural forces; both are legitimateproceedings in occult metaphysics, and the process yields some very interestingclues and some very important practical applications. We must not, however, makethe mistake of the ignorant, and say A is B when we mean A is of the same natureas B. But equally we may legitimately avail ourselves of the Hermetic axiom, \"Asabove, so below,\" because if A and B are of the same nature, the laws governingA can be predicated concerning B.What is true of the drop is true of the ocean. Consequently, if we know anythingconcerning the nature of A, we may conclude that, allowing for the difference inscale, it will apply to B. This is the method of analogy used in the inductivescience of the ancients, and provided it is counter-checked by observation andexperiment, it can yield some very fruitful results and cut out many leagues ofweary wandering in the dark.6. The personification and deification of the natural forces was man's firstcrude and shrewd attempt to evolve a monistic theory of the universe and savehimself from the destructive and crippling influence of an unresolved dualism.As age by age extended his knowledge and elaborated his intellectual processes,he read more and more significance into the first simple classifications.Nevertheless, he did not discard his original classifications, because they werefundamentally sound and represented actualities. He Mystical Qabala Page 58simply elaborated and extended them, and finally, when he fell on evil times,overlaid them with superstition.7. We should not, therefore, regard the pagan pantheons as so many aberrationsof the human mind; nor should we try to understand them from the viewpoint ofthe uninstructed and uninitiated; we should try to find out what they must havemeant to the highly intelligent and cultured high-priests of the cults in theirheyday. Compare Mme David Neel and W. B. Seabrook on the subject of heathenrites with the reports of the average missionary. Seabrook shows us thespiritual significance of voodoo, and Mme David Neel shows us the metaphysicalaspect of Thibetan magic. These things appear in one way to the sympatheticobserver who wins the conBdence of the exponents of these systems and succeedsin being received into their holy of holies as a friend, and who goes to learninstead of merely to observe and ridicule, and in another way to the \"beef-fedzealot\" who walks into the holy place in his dirty boots and gets stoned by theindignant worshippers.8. In judging these things let us consider the form Christianity would presentif approached in the same way. Unsympathetic observers would probably concludethat we worshipped a sheep, and the Holy Ghost would yield some spectacularinterpretations.Let us credit other people with using metaphors if we do not expect to be takenliterally our-selves. The outer form of the ancient pagan faiths is no cruderthan Christianity in backward Latin countries, where Jesus Christ is representedin topper and tails and the Virgin Mary in lace-edged pantaloons. The inner formof the ancient faiths can compare very favourably with the best of our modernmetaphysicians. After all, they produced Plato and Plotinus. The human mind doesnot change, and what is true of ourselves is probably true of the pagans. TheLamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world is only another version ofthe Bull of Mithra which does the same thing, the only difference being that theancient initiate was literally \"Washed in blood\" and the modern one takes itmetaphorically. Autres temps autres mours.9. If we approach those whom we elect to call pagans, both ancient and modern,in a reverent and sympathetic spirit, knowing that Allah and Brahma and Amen Raare but other[Page 88]names for that which we worship as God, we shall learn a very great deal thatwas forgotten in Europe when the Gnosis was stamped out and its literaturedestroyed.10. We shall find, however, that the pagan faiths present their teaching in aform that is not readily assimilable by the European mind, and that if we are toarrive at its significance we must re-state it in our own terms. We mustcorrelate the metaphysical concept with the pagan symbol; then we shall be ableto apply to the former the vast mass of mystical experience which generations ofcontemplatives and expen. mental psychologists have organised about the latter.And when we speak of experimental psychologists, we must not make the mistake ofthinking that they are an exclusively Mystical Qabala Page 59modern product, because the priests of the ancient Mysteries, with their templesleep and deliberately induced hypnogogic visions, were nothing more nor lessthan experimental psychologists, though their art has been lost, like many otherof the ancient arts, and is only being laboriously recovered piecemeal in themore advanced circles of scientific thought.11. The method used by the modern initiate for interpreting the language spokenby the ancient myths is a very simple and effectual one. He finds in theQabalistic Tree of Life a link between the highly stylistic pagan systems andhis own more rational methods; the Jew, Asiatic by blood and monotheistic byreligion, has a foot in both worlds. Upon the Tree of Life with its Ten HolySephiroth the modern occultist bases both a metaphysic and a magic. He uses aphilosophical conception of the Tree to interpret what it represents to hisconscious mind, and he uses a magical and ceremonial application of itssymbolism to link it up with his subconscious mind. The initiate, consequently,makes the best of both worlds, ancient and modern; for the modern world is allsurface consciousness, and has forgotten and repressed the subconsciousness, toits own great hurt; and the ancient world was mainly subconsciousness,consciousness having been but recently evolved. When the two are linked up andbrought into polarised function they yield super-consciousness, which is thegoal of the initiate.12. Holding the foregoing conceptions in mind, let us now try to co-ordinate theancient pantheons with the Spheres upon the Tree of Life. There are ten suchSpheres, the Ten Holy Sephiroth, and between these we must distribute, accordingto type, the different gods and goddesses of whatever pantheon we wish to study;we are then in a position to interpret their significance in the light of whatwe already know concerning the principles represented by the Tree, and to add toour knowledge of the Tree all that is available concerning the significance ofthe ancient deities.13. This is, obviously, of great intellectual value-but there is another valuewhich does not so readily appear to the average man who has had no experience ofMystery-workings; the performance of a ceremonial rite symbolically representingthe working of the force personified as a god, has a very marked and evendrastic effect on the subconscious mind of any person who is at all susceptibleto psychic influences. The ancients had brought these rites to a very high pitchof perfection, and when we moderns are trying to reconstruct the lost art ofpractical magic we can go to them with great profit. The whole philosophy ofEuropean magic is based upon the Tree, and no one can hope to understand it oruse it intelligently who has not been trained in the Qabalistic methods. It isthis lack of training which makes popular occultism so very apt to degenerateinto the crudest superstition. \"Your number in your name\" becomes a differentthing when we understand the mathematical Qabalah; fortunes in tea-cups areanother matter when we understand the significance of the Magical Images and themethod of their formulation and interpretation as a psychological device forpenetrating the veil of the unconscious.Mystical Qabala Page 6014. Broadly speaking, then, we sort out the gods and goddesses of all the paganpantheons into the ten pigeon-holes of the Ten Holy Sephiroth, relying chieflyupon their astrological associations to guide us, because astrology is the[Page 90]one universal language, for all people see the same Planets. Space is referredto Kether, the Zodiac to Chokmah, the seven planets to the next seven Sephiroth,and Earth to Malkuth, Consequently, any god who has an analogy with Saturn willbe referred to Binah, as will any goddess who might be termed the primordialmother, the Superior Eve,as distinguished from the Inferior Eve, the Bride of Microprosopos, Malkuth.The Supernal triangle of Kether, Chokmah) and Binah always refers to the OldGods, which every pantheon recognises as the predecessors of those forms ofgodhead worshipped by the current faith. Thus Rhea and Kronos would be referredto Binah and Chokmah, and Jupiter to Chesed. All the corn goddesses refer toMalkuth, and all the lunar goddesses to Yesod. The war gods and destructivegods, or divine devils, refer to Geburah, and the goddesses of love to Netzach.The initiator gods of wisdom are referred to Hod, and the sacrificed gods andredeemers to Tiphareth. So great an authority as Richard Payne Knight in hisvaluable book, The Symbolic Language of Ancient Art and Mythology, speaks of\"the remarkable concurrence of the allegories, symbols, and titles of ancientmythology in favour of the mystic system of emanations.\" With this clue we sortout the pantheons, thus enabling ourselves to compare like with like and makethe one illuminate the other.15. In the system he gives in his book of correspondences, 777,\" Crowley assignsthe gods to the Paths as well as to the Sephiroth. This, in my opinion, is amistake and leads to confusion. It is the Sephiroth alone that represent naturalforces; the Paths are states of consciousness. The Sephiroth are objective andthe Paths are subjective. It is for this reason that in the working glyph of theTree used by initiates the Sephiroth are always represented in one Colour Scaleand the Paths in another. Those who possess this glyph will know to what Irefer.16. The Paths themselves, in my opinion, should be regarded as under the directpresidency of the Holy Names governing their Sephirothic attributions only, andshould not be confused with other pantheons; for although we may go to othersystems for intellectual enlightenment, we are unwise to attempt to mix themethods of practical working and unfoldment of consciousness.17. For instance, the Seventeenth Path, between Tiphareth and Binab, is assignedby the Sepher Yet~rah to the Element of Air. We are far wiser to work it withthe rite of the Element of Air and the Holy Names assigned thereto, and toapproach it through the appropriate Tattva, rather than confuse the issue withthe associations of the assorted collection of deities, Castor and Pollux,Janus, Apollo, Merti, and other incompatibles assigned to it by Crowley, whosecorrespondences present an inextricable tangle of associations.Mystical Qabala Page 6118. The Sephiroth should be interpreted macrocosmically, and the Pathsmicrocosmically; thus we shall find the clue to the Tree in both man and nature.CHAPTER XIIIPRACTICAL WORK UPON THE TREE1. If among the readers who have followed these studies in the Qabalah thus farthere are any of the more advanced students of Western occultism, they will nodoubt have found much more that is familiar than is new or original. In work mgupon this storehouse of ancient knowledge we are in the position of excavatorsworking on the site of a buried temple; we are digging up fragments rather thanstudying a coherent system; for the system, though coherent enough in itsheyday, was broken and scattered and defaced by the persecutions of twentycenturies ot unenlightened bigotry and spintual jealousy.2. More work has been done upon these scattered fragments than is generallyrealised, however. Mme Blavatsky gathered together a great mass of data andexposed it to the gaze of a public which understood it little better than thechild gazing at the cases in a museum and marveillng at the queer things theycontain. The scholarly work of G. R. S.Mead has given us much information concerning the Gnosis, the esoteric traditionof the Western world during the earlier centuries of our epoch; Mrs Atwood'smonumental book has revealed the significance of the Alchemical symbolism to us.None of these, however, have expounded the Western Tradition as initiates ofthat Tradition, but have approached it from outside and either pieced togetherits fragments, or, as in the case of Mme Blavatsky, interpreted it by analogy inthe light of the more familiar system of another Tradition.3. Those who approached the study of the subject from the inside-that is to say,with the initiatory keys-and employed[Page 92]it as a practical system for the exaltation of consciousness have, for the mostpart, maintained a secrecy which, though it raight have been not onlyjustifiable and even essential in the days when the Holy Inquisition rewardedsuch researches with the stake, is difficult to assign to any more creditablemotive in our liberal age than a desire to create and maintain prestige. A veryeffectual \"corner\" in occult practice, if not in occult knowledge, has beenestablished and maintained among English-speaking peoples for the last quarterof a century. A \"corner\" that effectually defeated the spiritual impulse whichshould have given rise to a renaissance of the Mysteries during the last quarterof the last century. Consequently, the earth being ripe for the sowing and thewheat not being broadcast therein, the four winds brought strange seeds to thewaiting ground, and a Mystical Qabala Page 62tropical growth sprang up that, having no roots in racial tradition, witheredaway or developed strange forms.4. The buried temple of our native tradition has in actuality been excavated inpart at any rate, but the rescued fragments have not been made available forstudents according to the honourable traditions of European scholarship, buthave been gathered together into private collections the keys whereof haverested in the pockets of individuals who have opened and closed the doors in anentirely arbitrary fashion. I have no doubt these pages will causeheart-burnings in certain quarters whose private collections they depreciate invalue. But I have no doubt also that the innumerable students who essayed theWestern Path in vain may find in these pages the keys to what wasincomprehensible to them in the method, or perhaps, to be more accurate, thecomplete lack of method, in which they were trained. Speaking for myself, ittook me ten years' work in the dark before I found the keys, and I only foundthese in the end because I was sufficiently psychic to pick up the Inner Planecontacts. I find it difficult to believe that any useful purpose is served bydeliberately darkening counsel or by withholding from the student keys andexplanations that are essential to his work. If the student is unworthy[Page 94]to be trained, do not let us train him. If he is to be trained at all, let ustrain him properly.5. In the following pages I have done my best to elucidate the principlesgoverning the use of magical symbolism. The practical use of the ceremonialmethod is best attempted under the guidance of one who is already experienced inits use; to work alone or with equally inexperienced comrades is to rununnecessary risks, but there is no reason why anyone should not experiment withthe meditative method.6. In order to use the magical symbols effectually one has to make the contactof each individual symbol. It is of little use to make a list of symbols andproceed to the construction of a ritual. In magic, as in violin-playing, one hasto \"make one's notes\"; one does not find them ready-made as on the piano. Thestudent of the violin has to learn to make each individual note before he canplay an air. So it is with any occult operation, we must know how to constructand contact the magical images before we can work with them.7. The sets of symbols associated with each of the Thirty-two Paths are used bythe initiate to build up the magical images; it is necessary that he should knowthese symbols not only in theory, but also in practice; that is to say, he mustnot only have them thoroughly well rooted in his memory, but must also haveperformed meditations upon them mdividually~until he has penetrated theirsignificance and experienced the force they represent. To know the vast range ofsymbols associated with each Path is, of course, the work of a lifetime, but thestudent must learn the key-symbols of each Path as the essential preliminary tohis studies; he is then able to recognise all other symbol-forms as they comehis way and assign them to their proper classification. His knowledge will thusdevelop under two aspects: firstly, the knowledge of the symbolism in itsMystical Qabala Page 63infinite ramifications; and secondly, the philosophy of the interpretation ofthat symbolism. Once he has mastered a working knowledge of the concepts ofesoteric cosmbgony and has the general scheme of symbolism assigned to eachSephirah well fixed in his memory, the student is equipped with a card-indexsystem and can commence filing, collecting the material for his files from everyimaginable source in archeology, folk-lore, mystical religion, travellers'tales, and the speculations of ancient and modern philosophy and ultra~modernscience.8. The uninitiated inquirer may wonder how the enormous mass of data is keptsorted in the memory. To begin with, the serious student who uses the Tree ashis meditationinethod works at it regularly every day. Moreover, it will befound by experience that the assignation of symbols to each Sephirah has apeculiar logical basis, hidden somewhere deep in the subconscious mind, and thesymbol-sequences are not nearly so difficult to remember as might be supposed,especially if they have been used for meditation. Some of the symbols refer tothe concepts of esoteric philosophy, some to the methods of projectingconsciousness in vision, and some to the composing of ceremonial. The studentmust remember, however, that the symbols will never yield their significance toconscious meditation alone, however correctly and completely they are known;they must be used as the initiates intended them to be used, to evoke imagesfrom the subconscious mind into conscious content.9. One set of symbols is assigned to the Ten Holy Sephiroth themselves, andanother set to the Twenty-two Paths that connect them. Some of the symbols,however, occur in both sets, and all of them interconnect through theirastrological and numerical correlations.This sounds most perplexingly complex, but in actual practice it is far simplerthan it sounds, because the work is not done with the conscious mind, but withthe subconscious mind, and it matters very little in what manner the symbols arepitchforked into it, the strange diemon that sits behind the censor sorts themout, picking that which it requires and rejecting all else, until finally acoherent pattern reappears in consciousness that only requires analysis to yieldits significance after the same manner as a dream.10. A vision evoked by the use of the Tree is, in fact, an[Page 96]artificially produced waking dream, deliberately motived and consciously relatedto some chosen subject whereby not only the subconscious content, but also thesuperconscious perceptions are evoked and rendered intelligible toconsciousness. In a spontaneous dream the symbols are drawn at random fromexperience; in the Qabalistic vision, however, the picture is evoked from alimited set of symbols to which consciousness is rigidly restricted by a highlytrained habit of concentration. It is this peculiar power to turn the mind loosewithin deter mined limits which constitutes the technique of occult meditation,and it is only to be acquired by constant practice over a considerable period.It is this which constitutes the difference between the trained and theuntrained occultist; the untrained person may be able to detach consciousnessfrom the control of the directing personality and thus allow the images to rise,but he has no power to restrict and Mystical Qabala Page 64select what shall appear, and consequently anything may appear, including avarying proportion of subconscious content. The trained occultist, however,accustomed to use this method in his meditations, is able to swing instantlyclear of the normal subconscious content unless it is disturbed by emotion, inwhich case he is liable to be entangled in its meshes; but even in this case hismethod is his protection, for he is inrrnediately able to recognise confusedsymbolism in the images because he has a definite standard of comparison withwhich to compare them.11. In studying the Tree the student should always think of each Sephirah underthe threefold aspect we have already mentioned of philosophy, psychism, andmagic; to this end he should always think of it firstly as representing acertain factor in the evolution of the cosmos in the immemorial past of cosmictime, whether it remains in manifestation, has passed away, or has not yetarrived at the level of dense matter.12. With this aspect of the Tree are also taken the curious cryptic texts of theSepher Yetzirah, one to each Path. These most baffling utterances have a curiousway of yielding sudden flashes of illumination to meditation and are by no meansto be rejected as rubbish, incomprehensible though they may appear at firstsight.13. Another source of illumination is to be found in the additional titles ofthe Sephiroth, each of which has anything from one to two or three dozen. Theseare graphic descriptive names applied to the various Sephiroth by the ancientRabbis and found scattered through the Qabalistic literature, and they tell us agreat many things. For instance, the titles\"Concealed of the Concealed\" and \"Primordial Point\" that are applied to Ketherconvey a good deal to those who know where to look for it.14. We can also, once we are acquainted with the symbolism, assign to thevarious Sephiroth their equivalent gods in other systems, and when we look upthe symbols, functions, cosmic concepts, and methods of worship assigned tothese deities we get a fresh flood of illumination. By the use of a goodmythological dictionary or an encyclopaedia, Frazer's Golden Bough, and MmeBlavatsky's Secret Doctrine and Isis Unveiled, we can, by the mere applicationof diligence, read a great many riddles that at first appeared insoluble, andthe exercise is a fascinating one. When used thus the Tree is peculiarlyvaluable, because its diagrammatic form causes things to be seen in relation toeach other, thus causing them to throw light upon each other.15. In order to manipulate the psychic aspect of the Tree and its Paths theoccultist uses images, because it is by means of images and the names that evokethem that vision is formulated. He associates with each Sephirah a primarysymbol, which is called its Magical Image. Secondly, he associates with it inhis mind a geometrical form which, in various ways, embodies itscharacteristics, and when he composes symbols he uses that form as the basis.For instance, Geburah, Mars, the Fifth Sephirab, has assigned to it a pentagonor five-sided figure. Any symbol of Geburah, whether it be a talisman, an altarto Mars, or a mental picture of a symbol, would be in the form of a pentagoncoloured in one of the colours of the Mars colourscale.Mystical Qabala Page 65[Page 98]16. The most important forms upon the Tree, however, are those associated withthe four Names of Power assigned to each Sephirah; with these are associatedfour colours in which they are conceived to manifest in a symbolic form in eachof the Four Worlds of the Qabalists. The highest of these is the God-name, whichmanifests in Atziluth, the plane of spirit, and is the supreme Name of Power ofthat Sephirothic Sphere and dominates all its aspects, whether cosmic,evolutionary, or subjective. It represents the idea underlying the develop~ mentof manifestation in that Sphere; the idea that runs through all subsequentevolution and expresses itself in all ensuing effects and manifestations.17. The second Name of Power is that of the Archangel of the Sphere, andrepresents the organised consciousness of the being through the activities ofwhich the evolution of that phase was inaugurated and directed. Although thesebeings are represented pictorially as of human form, though etherealised, itmust not be thought that life and consciousness as we know them in any waycorrespond to their nature. They are more akin in essence to natural forces, yetif we consider them simply as unintelligent energy we shall have no adequateconcept of their nature, because they are essentially individualised,intelligent; and purposive. Both these ideas must enter into our concept,modifying each other, till finally we shall arrive at a realisation that differsvery widely from anything to which Western thought is accustomed.18. The third Name of Power denominates, not one being, but a whole class ofbeings, the choirs of angels as they are called by the rabbis, and these againrepresent intelligent natural forces.19. The fourth denominates what we have called the Mundane Chakra, that is tosay the celestial object which is looked upon as the product of the particularphase of evolution which took place under the presidency of that Sephirah andwhich represents it.20. The third aspect under which we consider the Sephiroth is the magical aspectand is essentially practical. To arrive at this, we think of what may beexperienced under the presidency of these different aspects ofdeity-manifestation, and what powers may be wielded by the magician when he hasmastered their lessons.21. Each Sephirah has assigned to it a virtue, which repre~~nts its idealaspect, the gift which it brings to evolution; and a vice which is the result ofthe overplus of its qualities.For instance, Geburah, Mars, has for its virtues energy and courage, and for itsvices cruelty and destructiveness. The student of astrology will at oncerecognise that the virtues and vices attributed to the various Sephiroth arederived from the characteristics of the planets associated with them, and willfind that in this correspondence a whole new line of approach to astrology isopened up.22. The spiritual experience as I prefer to call it, or occult power as Crowleycalls it, is a profound realisation or vision of some aspect of cosmic science.This constitutes the Mystical Qabala Page 66essence of the initiation of the grade assigned to each Sephirah, for in theGreater Mysteries of the West the grades are associated with the Sephiroth.23. The mediaeval Qabalists also assigned a part of the body to each Sephirah,but this must not be taken too literally; the real key is to be found in therealisation that the different Sephiroth represent factors in consciousness, andif we take Geburah as the strong right arm, we must realise that it really meansthe dynamic will, the executive capacity, the destruction of the effete andunbalanced.24. Each Sephirah and Path has assigned to it symbolic animals, plants, andprecious stones. It is necessary that the student should know these for tworeasons: firstly, they give some very important keys to the relations of thegods of the different pantheons to the Sephiroth; and secondly, they form partof the symbolism of the Astral Paths and serve as landmarks when travelling inthe spirit-vision. For instance, if one saw a horse (Mars) or a jackal (Luna) inthe sphere of Netzach (Venus), one would know that there was confusion of planeand the vision was not reliable. In her Sphere one[Page 100]would expect to see her doves, and a spotted beast, such as a lynx or leopard.25. It may be thought that the association of the symholi~ beasts with the godsand goddesses in the old myths is entirely arbitrary and the fruit of the poeticimagination, which, like the wind, bloweth where it listeth. To this theoccultist answers that the poetic imagination is not an arbitrary thing andrefers the sceptic to the works of Dr Jung of Zurich, the famous psychiatrist,and to the essays of the Irish poet,\" A. E.,\" in particular Song and itsFountains, wherein he analyses the nature of his own sources of inspiration.From the intrinsic nature of his poetry, and from many passing references in hisworks, I think we may be entitled to claim \"A. E.\" as one of that band ofstudents who have been nurtured on the mystical Qabalah. At any rate, what hehas to say is sound Qabalistic doctrine and extremely illuminating to ourpresent argument.26. Dr Jung has a great deal to say concerning the myth-making faculty of thehuman mind, and the occultist knows it to be true. He knows also, however, thatits implications are much farther reaching than psychology has yet suspected.The mind of poet or mystic, dwelling upon the great natural forces and factorsof the manifested universe, has, by the creative use of the imagination,penetrated far more deeply into their secret causes and springs of being thanhas the scientist; it is not for nothing that the racial imagination, workingthus, has come to associate certain animals with certain gods; a briefexamination of the examples cited serves to show the basis of the association.The doves of Venus show her gentler aspect, and the cat-beasts her sinisterbeauty.27. The association of plants with the different Paths rests upon a twofoldbasis. Firstly, there are plants traditionally associated with the legends ofthe gods, as is corn with Ceres and the vine with Dionysos; these we findassociated with the Sephiroth, with which the functions of these gods arecorrelated~orn with Malkuth and the vine with Tiphareth, the Mystical QabalaPage 67Chnst-centre, wherewith are associated all the Sacrificed Gods and the givers ofillumination.28. Plants are also associated with the Sephiroth in another way; the olddoctrine of signatures assigned various plants to the presidency of variousplanets in a somewhat erratic fashion. In some cases there was a genuineassociation, in others it was arbitrary and superstitious. Old Culpepper andother ancient herbalists have a great deal to say on the subject, and some veryinteresting researches are being done on the Anthroposophical experimentalfarms.29. In a similar way certain drugs are associated with the different Sephiroth;and here again we need to distinguish the superstitious from the mystical. Thearbitrary attribution of drugs cannot always be justified by actual experiment,but we raay safely say that whole classes of drugs could be regarded as underthe presidency of certain Sephiroth because they partake of the nature ofcertain modes of activity which are classified under these Sephiroth. Forinstance, all aphrodisiacs could justly be assigned to Netzach (Venus), and allabortifacients to Yesod in her Hecate aspect; analgesics to Chesed (Mercy), andirritants and caustics to Geburah (Severity).30. This opens up a very interesting aspect of the study of materia medica-thepsychic and psychological aspect of drug activity. It was this aspect which wasespecially studied by the initiate-physicians such as Paracelsus, and it was theignorant and superstitious abuse of this aspect by uninitiated physicians thatled to the extraordinary aberrations of folk-medicine.31. The occultist knows that there is a psychological aspect to everyphysiological action and function; he also knows that it is possible powerfullyto reinforce the action of all drugs by the appropriate mental action, and thatcertain chemically inert substances lend themselves effectually to thetransmission and storing of mental activities, just as other substances areeffectual conductors or insulators of electricity.32. This consideration brings us to the question of the association of certainprecious stones and metals with the different Sephiroth, an associationdetermined by both astrological and alchemical considerations. As is well knownto[Page 102]psychics, crystalline substances, metals, and certain liquids are the best mediafor conveying or storing subtle forces. Colour plays an important part in thevisions induced by meditation on the various Sephiroth, and it is found byexperience that a crystal of the appropriate colour is the best material out ofwhich to make a talisman: a blood-red ruby for the fiery Martian forces ofGeburah; an emerald for the Green Ray nature forces of Netzach.33. Perfumes, especially incense, are also associated with the differentSephiroth. As has already been noted, certain spiritual experiences and certainmodes of consciousness are Mystical Qabala Page 68assigned to each Sphere on the Tree; it is well known that nothing inducesstates of mind or stimulates psychic consciousness more effectually than odours.\"Scents are surer than sights or sounds to make your heart-strings crack,\" saysthe most objective of poets, and the experience of practical occultists provesthis to be true. There are certain aromatic substances associated by traditionwith the different gods and goddesses, and these are most effectually potent tostimulate the mood which is in harmony with the function of that deity.34. Magical weapons are also included in the long lists of symbols andsubstances associated with each Path. A magical weapon is an instrument of somesort which is used in the evocation of a particular force, or is the vehicle ofits manifestation, such as the rod of the magician or the bowl of water orcrystal sphere of the seer. The assignation of the magical weapons to the Pathstells us a good deal about the nature of the Paths, because we can deducetherefrom the kind of power that operates in the particular sphere in question.35. As already noted, the various divinatory systems have their relations withthe Tree and find their subtlest clues therein. The associations of astrologyare readily traced through the symbolism of the planets and elements and theirtriplicities, houses, and rulership; geomancy links with the Tree via astrology;and the Tarot, the most satisfactory of all the systems of divination, risesfrom and finds its explanation in the Tree and nowhere else. That may seem adogmatic statement to the scholarly historian searching for traces of the originof those mysterious cards, and, may we add, most unamentably failing to find it;but when it is realised that the initiate works the Tarot and the Tree together,and that they dovetail into each other at every imaginable angle, it will beseen that such an array of correspondences could be neither arbitrary norfortuitous.36. A most interesting and important aspect of the practical work of the Treeconcerns the manner in which ceremonial and talismanic magic are used tocompensate the findings of the divinatory sciences. Each prick-symbol ofgeomancy, each card of the Tarot, and each horoscopic factor have their placesassigned to them on the Paths of the Tree, and the occultist with the necessaryknowledge can put together a ritual or design a talisman to compensate orreinforce each and any of these.37. It is for this reason that divination by the uninitiated is apt to bring badluck in its train, for it stirs the subtle forces by concentrating the mind uponthem, without compensating that which is out of equilibrium by the appropriatemagical effort.PART IICHAPTER XIVGENERAL CONSIDERATIONSMystical Qabala Page 691. In Part I we considered the general scheme and method of using the QabalisticTree of Life. We now come to the detailed study of the individual Sephiroth.This study must necessarily be tentative, for a life's research could be givento the significance of the correspondences that spread in end less ramificationsfrom every symbol associated with each Sephirah. But a start must be made, hencethese tentative jottings; for I do not consider the following chapters on theindividual Sephiroth worthy to be called anything better than this, even thoughthey are the fruit of ten years' meditation on that marvellous composite symbol.2. The Tables of Correspondences at the head of each section consist of aselection of the principal symbols and ideas associated with each Sephirah, andhave no claim whatsoever to comprehensiveness. They contain, however, the moresignificant symbols, and are suificient to enable the student to gain a soundphilosophical grasp of the subject, and experiment for himself in the use of theTree as a meditation symbol.3. The references are taken chiefly from \"777,\" by Aleister Crowley, who gotthem from the MacGregor Mathers MSS. Mathers, so far as I have been able totrace his references, for he gives no authorities, drew upon the work of Dr Deeand Sir Edward Kelly; Cornelius Agrippa; Raymond Lully and Pietro de Abana amongthe earlier writers.Among the moderns the same material is found scattered through the works ofKnorr von Rosenroth; Wynn Westcott; Eliphas Levi; Mrs Atwood; Mme Blavatsky;Anna Kingsford;[Page 104]Mabel Collins; Papus (Encausse); St Martin; Gerald Massey; G. R. S Mead, andmany others. To some of these it is probable he was indebted; others may havebeen indebted to him; some of them were actually members of the Order of theGolden Dawn which he founded.4. Other sources of information are Frazer's Golden Bough; the works of WallisBudge; the writings of Drs Jung and Freud; the translations of Dr Jowett fromthe Greek; the Sacred Books of the East Series, the Loeb Classical Library; thetranslation of Plotinus by Stephen MacKenna; the translation of tbe Zohar issuedby the Soncino Press; and last, but by no means the least valuable source ofinformation, the Holy Bible. So much for occult secrecy!5. It will be seen that the symbols assigned to each Sephirah are classified inregular order under certain headings. To understand the significance attached tothese different sections by the occultist and the use he makes of them it isnecessary to explain the method of classification in detail.6. SECTION 1. The Title assigned to the Sephirah.- Its name is given first inHebrew and then in English, and the Hebrew spelling appended. The accuratespelling of all proper names used in the Qabalah is vitally important because ofthe numerical value attached to them by the Qabalists and the use made of thesignificance of these numbers by those Mystical Qabala Page 70who work the numerological methods. I am neither a numerologist nor amathematician, and I do not therefore propose to comment on that which liesoutside the sphere of my knowledge. I merely give the data for the convenienceof those who can appreciate its significance.7. SECTION 2. The Magical Image and the Symbols associated with eachSephirah.-The magical image is the mental picture which the occultist builds upto represent the Sephirah, and its details yield many significant symbols tomeditation. These images are so old, and have been built with such a wealth ofmagical working, that they are apt to build themselves up of their own accordduring meditation upon the Sephiroth. In the course of my own work on theQabalah I saw most of[Page 106]them long before I had access to the tables that gave the~ In practical workingthe initiated adept builds them detailed symbolism, and it is a very valuablemagical exercise up to practise the visualisation of the magical images in theirfullest detail. Much of this detail can be gleaned frorn the accounts I give ofeach Sephirah, but readers who have specialised knowledge of the Eastern orclassical pantheons any can elaborate these images to any extent, surroundingthern with all the paraphernalia of the gods assigned to each Station on theTree; these can be identified through their astrological associations.8. SECTION 3. The Situation on the Tree. This throws an immense amount of lightupon any meditation, for it reveals the equilibrium of the spiritual forcesworking in nature. For instance, Geburah (Mars) and Chesed or Gedulah (Jupiter)are opposite each other upon the Tree. The warrior king and the wise and benignlawgiver of peace balance each other.Geburah when unbalanced becomes cruelty and oppression, and Gedulah whenunbalanced suffers evil to multiply.9. SECTION 4. The Yetziratic Text.- This consists of the description of theSphere or Path given in the Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of Formations. Thetranslation I have used is that of Wynn Westcott.10. These descriptions are exceedingly cryptic, but they will from time to timeyield a flash of inspiration, and undoubtedly contain the essence of theQabalistic philosophy.11. SECTION 5. Descriptive Titles. - A catalogue of the names that have beenapplied to that particular Sephirah in the Rabbinical literature. These throwgreat light on the subject and are also useful to the student for purposes ofreference when tracing out the ideas associated with a particular Sephirah.12 . SECTION 6 . The Names of Power assigned to each Sephira -The God-namerepresents the most spiritual form of the force and is conceived of asrepresenting the functiofliog Of that force in the Kingdom of Atziluth, thehighest of the FOLLZKingdoms of the Qabalists.Mystical Qabala Page 7113. The Archangelic Names represent the functioning of a force in Briah, theKingdom of the higher mind, are the archetypal ideas.14 . Angelic choirs correspond to the Kingdom of or the Astral Plane, and theMundane Chakras arerepresentatives of each force in the Kingdom of Assiah - the Material Plane.15. What I call in my tables the spiritual experience assigned to each sephirahis called by Crowley the magical power. - whereas this term may be rightlyassigned to the Twenty-two paths, it is misleading when applied to theSephiroth. I have changed the term in relation to the Sephiroth themselves, butretained it in reference to the Paths for reasons which will presently be seen.16. SECTION 7. The Virtues and Vices assigned to each Sephirah of the Tree.-These indicate the qualities necessary in order to take the initiation of thatgrade, and the form that is taken by any unbalanced force in that sphere. In thehighest grade of all, before form is developed, there is no correspondence.17. SECTION 8 . Correspondence in Microcosm.-The microcosm - which is man,corresponds with the Sephirothic macrocosm, and is important from many practicalstandpoints, particularly that of spiritual healing and astrology.18. SECTION 9. The Four Suits of the Tarot Pack.-The • • ~IO' don of the Tarotcards to the Tree opens up immense 1 of practical importance and forms thephilosophical b~h ofthe divinatory art.19 N the reader keeps these explanations in mind he will he able to follow thelines of reasoning and allusion developedthe Ciucidation of the symbolism assigned to each Sephirah.~ There is an immense amount of work to be done in''~ the different polytheistic pantheons and the of Christian, Hebrew, andMohammedan faiths~ the ~~5~~tions of the Tree. This has been done ~ b Y Crowley, and is, I fancy,original work and not rtrl Mathers. Its implications are not altogether108 THE MYSTICAL QABALAHMystical Qabala Page 72[Page 108]clear to me, and I doubt if I could subscribe to all of thern An immensely widerange of scholarship is necessary for the satisfactory accomplishment of thisbranch, a range of scholar ship which I do not possess. I shall thereforecontent myself with touching upon such points as have come within the range ofmy knowledge and make no attempt in the present pages at an orderedclassification.21. SECTION 10. The Flashing Colours.- This is only of Use to advanced studentswho possess the necessary keys.CHAPTER XVKETHER, THE FIRST SEPHIRAHTITLE: Kether, the Crown. (Hebrew spelling: - Kaph, Tau, Resh.)

Kether, the Crown, is placed at the head of the Middle Pillar of Equilibrium,and from it depend backwards the Negative Veils of Existence. I have alreadywritten concerning the use of these Negative Veils as a background to thought,so I will not repeat myself upon this point, but remind the reader that Kether,the First Manifest, represents the primal crystallisation into manifestation ofthat which was hitherto unmanifest and therefore unknowable by us. Concerningthe root from which Kether springs we can know nothing; but concerning Ketheritself we can know something. It may be for us at our stage of development theGreat Unknown, but it is not the Great Unknowable. The mind of the magus mustcompass it in his higher visions. In my own experiences with the operation knownas Rising on the Planes, which consists in carrying consciousness up the MiddlePillar by means of concentration on the successive symbols and the Paths,Kether, on the one occasion when I touched its fringe, appeared as a blindingwhite light, in which all thought went completely blank.Mystical Qabala Page 742. In Kether there is no form but only pure being, whatever that may be. It is,one might say, a latency only one degree removed from non-existence. Suchconcepts must necessarily be vague, and I am ill-equipped to give them suchdefiniteness as they might possess, but I am quite satisfied that we shouldrecognise grades of becoming, and that the crude differentiation of Being andNon-being does not represent the facts. With manifested existence there comeinto being the pairs of opposites; but in Kether there is no division into thepairs of opposites, which must wait for their manifestation till Chokmah andBinab are emanated.3. Kether, then, is the One, and existed before there was any reflection ofitself to serve it for an image in consciousness and set up polarity. We mustbelieve that it transcended all known laws of manifestation by existing alone,without reaction. But when we speak of Kether it must be remembered that we donot mean a person, but a state of existence, and this state of existingsubstance must have been utterly inert, pure being without activity, until theactivity began which emanated Chokmah.4. The human mind, knowing no other mode of existence than that of form andactivity, has the greatest difficulty in obtaining any adequate concept of anentirely formless state of passivity which is nevertheless most distinctly notnon-being. Yet this effort must be made if we are to understand cosmicphilosophy in its fundamentals. We must not draw the Veils of Negative Existencein front of Kether or we shall condemn ourselves to a perpetual unresolvedduality; God and the Devil will for ever war in our cosmos, and there can be nofinality to their conflict. We must train the mind to conceive the state of purebeing without attributes or activities; we may think of it as the blinding whitelight, undifferentiated into rays by the prism of form; or we may think of it asthe darkness of interstellar space, which is nothing, yet contains thepotentialities of all things. These symbols, dwelt upon by the inner eye, are agreater aid to the understanding of Kether than any amount of exactphilosophical definitions. We cannot define Kether; we can only indicate it.5. It is a continual surprise and illumination to discover the extraordinarysignificance of the hints contained in the tables of correspondences, and themanner in which they lead the mind on from concept to concept when ponderedupon. The First Sephirah is called the Crown, be it noted, not the head. Now theCrown is something superimposed upon the head, and this gives us a clear hintthat Kether is of our cosmos, but not in it. We also find its microcosmiccorrespondence in the Thousand-petalled Lotus, the Sahamsara Chakra, which is inthe aura immediately above the head. This, I think, teaches[Page 112]us clearly that the innermost spiritual essence of anything, whether man orworld, is never in actual manifestation, but is always the underlying,behind-standing basis or root whence all springs, belonging in fact to adifferent dimension, a different order of being.It is this concept of the different types of existence which is fundamental toesoteric philosophy) and must always be borne in mind when considering theinvisible kingdoms of the magician, or operative occultist.Mystical Qabala Page 756. In the Vedantan philosophy Kether would undoubtedly equate with Parabrahman,Chokmah with Brahman, and Binah with Mulaprakriti. In the other great Systems ofhuman thought Kether equates with their primary concept and may be taken as theFather of the Gods. If for them the universe originated in space, then Kether isthe Sky God. If it originated in water, Kether is the primordial ocean. Alwayswe find in connection with Kether the sense of formlessness and timelessness.The gods of Kether are terrible gods which eat their children, for Kether,although the parent of all, reabsorbs the universe back into itself at the endof an epoch ofevolution.7. Kether is the abyss whence all arose, and back into which it will fall at theend of its epoch. Therefore in exoteric myths associated with Kether we find theimplication of non-existence. In esoteric concepts, however, we learn that sucha concept is erroneou~.Kether is the intensest form of existence, pure being unlimited by form orreaction; but it is existence of another type than that to which we areaccustomed, and therefore it appears to us as non-existence because it conformsto none of the requirements we are accustomed to think of as determiningexistence. This concept of other modes of existence is implicit in ourphilosophy and must ever be borne in mind, for it is the key to Kether, andKether is the key to the Tree of Life.8. The Yetziratic Text descriptive of Kether, like all the sayings of the SepherYetzirah, is a hidden saying. It calls Kether the Hidden Intelligence, and thisappellation is confirmed by several other of the titles given to Kether inQabalistic literature. It is the Concealed of the Concealed, the InscrutableHeight, the Head which is not. Here again we get confirmation of the idea thatthe crown is above the head of the Celestial Man, Adam Kadmon; that pure beingstands behind manifestation and is not absorbed into it, but rather emanates orprojects it. As we express ourselves in our works, so does Kether express itselfin manifestation. But a man's works do not constitute his personality, but arethe expression of its natural activity. So it is with Kether; its mode ofexistence is not manifested, but is the cause of manifestation.II9. We have hitherto considered Kether in Atziluth, that is to say as itsessential and primal essence. We must now consider Kether as it appears in thethree other Kingdoms distinguished by the Qabalists.10. Each Kingdom or plane of manifestation has its primary form; matter, forinstance, is in all probability primarily electric, and this is expressed by theesotericists as the etheric sub-plane which lies behind the four elementalplanes of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water; or in other words, the four conditions ofdense matter, solid, liquid, gaseous, and etheric.11. The Qabalists conceive of the Tree as existing in each of the four Kingdomsof Atailuth, pure spirit; Briah, archetypal mind; Yetzirah, astralpicture-consciousness; and Assiah, the material world in both its dense andsubtler aspects. The operations of the Mystical Qabala Page 76forces of each Sephirah are represented in each world under the presidency of aDivine Name, or Word of Power, and these words give the keys to the operationsof practical occultism upon the planes. The God-name represents the action ofthe Sephirah in the world of Atziluth, pure spirit; when the occultist invokesthe forces of a Sephirah by the God-name, it means that he desires to contactits most abstract essence, that he is seeking the spiritual principle underlyingand conditioning that particular mode of manifestation.It is a maxim of White Occultism that every operation should commence with theinvocation of the God-name[Page 114]of the Sphere in which the operation is to take place. This ensures that theoperation shall be in harmony with cosmic law. The balance of natural force isnot lightly to be overset.It is essential to the safety of the magician that he Should conduct hisoperations in accordance with cosmic law; therefore he must seek to understandthe spiritual principle involved in every problem and work it out accordingly.Every opera tion, therefore, must have its final unification or resolution inEheieh, the God-name of Kether in Atziluth.12. The invocation of Deity under the name of Eheieh, that is to say theaffirmation of pure being, eternal, unchanging, without attributes oractivities, underlying, maintaining, and conditioning all, is the primaryformula of all magical working. It is only when the mind is imbued with therealisation of this endless unchanging being of the utmost concentration andintensity that it can have any realisation of limitless power. Energy derivedfrom any other source is a limited and partial energy. In Kether alone is thepure source of all energy. The operations of the magician that aim at theconcentrating of energy (and what operations do not?) must always start withKether, because here we touch the upwelling force ansing from the GreatUnmanifest, the reservoir of limitless power.It is through Kether, from the Great Unmanifest hidden behind the Veils ofNegative Existence, that power is drawn. If we draw power from any specialisedsphere of nature, we are, as it were, robbing Peter to pay Paul. The power hascome from somewhere, and gone somewhere, and it has to be accounted for at thefinal reckoning. It is for this reason that it has been held that the magicianpays in suffering for what he wins by magical means. This is true if hisoperation is performed in any of the lower spheres of nature; but if it startsin the Kether of Atziluth, he is drawing unmanifest force into manifestation; heis adding to the resources of the universe, and provided he keeps the forces inequilibrium, there need be no untoward reaction and no payment in suffering forthe use of the magical powers.13. This is a point of tremendous practical importance. Students have beentaught that the Three Supernals, Kether, Chokmah, and Binab, are beyond therange of practical working so long as we are in incarnation. True, they arebeyond the range of brain consciousness, but they are the essential basis of allmagical calculations, and if we do not work from this basis we have no cosmicfoundation, but are poised between heaven and earth and Mystical Qabala Page 77find no place of rest or security, but must ever maintain the magical stressesthat keep the astral forms in being.14. The great difference between Christian Science and the cruder forms of NewThought and Auto-suggestion is that it starts all its workings in the DivineLife; and utterly irrational though its attempts to philosophise its system maybe, its methods are empirically sound. The occultist, and especially thepractitioner of ceremonial magic, if uninstructed in this discipline, tends tostart his operation without any reference to cosmic law or spiritual principle;consequently the astral images he forms are like foreign bodies in the organismof the Celestial Man, or Macrocosm, and all the forces of nature arespontaneously directed towards the elimination of the foreign substance and therestoration of the normal equilibrium of stresses. Nature fights the magiciantooth and nail; consequently, whosoever has resorted to unconsecrated magic maynever lay down his sword, but must always be on the defensive in order tomaintain that which he has won. But the adept who starts his work in the Ketherof Atziluth, that is to say in spiritual principle, and works that principledownwards to its expression on the planes of form, employing power drawn fromthe Unmanifest for this purpose, has made his Operation a part of the cosmicprocess, and Nature is with him instead of against him.15. We cannot hope to understand the nature of Kether in Atailuth, but we canopen our consciousness to its influence; and its influence is very powerful andgives a strange sense of eternity and immortality. We may know when theinvocation of Eheieh in its pure white brilliance has been effectual, because Weshall find ourselves realising with complete conviction the[Page 116]utter impermanence and insignificance of the planes of form and the supremeimportance of the One Life which conditions all form as clay in the hands of thepotter.16. Meditation upon Kether gives us an intuitive realisation that the issue ofan Operation does not matter in the very least. \"Let the dirt play with the dirtif it pleases the dirt.\"Once that realisation has been obtained we have lordship over the astral imagesand can turn them this way and that as it pleases us. It is only when theoperator cares nothing for the outcome of the operation on the physical planethat he attains to this com plete lordship over the astral images. He isconcerned simply and solely with the handling of forces and the bringing of themthrough into manifestation in form; but he does not care what form the forcesmay ultimately assume, he leaves that to them; for they will assuredly assumethe form that is most consonant with their nature, and thus be truer to cosmiclaw than any design which his limited knowledge could assign to them. This isthe real key to all magical operations, and their sole justification, for we maynot turn the universe round and about to suit our whim or convenience, but areonly justified in the deliberate work of magic when we work with the great tideof evolving life in order to bring ourselves into fullness of life whatever formthat experience or manifestation may take. \"I' am come that they might havelife, and that they might have it more abundantly,\"said Our Lord, and that should be the word of the magician. Life, and lifealone, should Mystical Qabala Page 78be his word, and not any specialised manifestation of it as Wisdom, Power, noreven Love.17. Those who have followed the preceding discussion point by point may now beable to see some significance in the cryptic words of the Yetziratic Textassigned to Kether. The words \"Hidden Intelligence\" convey a hint of theunmanifest nature of the existence of Kether, which is confirmed by thestatement that \" No created being can attain to its essence\"; that is to say, nobeing using as its vehicle of consciousness any organism of the planes of form.When, however, consciousness has been exalted to the point where it transcendsthought, it receives from the \"Primal Glory\" 'the power of comprehension of theFirst Principle,'; or in other words, \"Then shall we know even as we are known.\"III18. Eheieh, I Am That I Am, pure being, is the God-name of Kether, and itsmagical image is an ancient bearded king seen in profile. The Zohar says of thisancient bearded king that he is all tight side; we do not see the magical imageof Kether full-face, that is to say complete, but only partially. There is anaspect which must ever be hidden from us, like the hidden side of the moon. Thisside of Kether is the side that is towards the Unmanifest, which the nature ofour manifested consciousness prevents us from comprehending, and which must everbe a sealed book to us. But accepting this limitation we may gaze incontemplation upon the aspect of Kether, the profile of the ancient beardedking, presented to us reflected downwards into form.19. Ancient is this king, the Ancient of Ancients, the Ancient of Days, for hewas from the beginning, when countenance beheld not countenance. A king he is,because he rules all things according to his supreme and unquestioned will. Inother words, it is the nature of Kether that conditions all things, because allthings are evolved from it. Bearded he is, because in the curious symbolism ofthe rabbis every hair of his beard has significance.20. The manifestation of the forces of Kether in Briah, the world of archetypalmind, is said to be through the archangel Metatron, the Prince of Countenances,who tradition avers was the teacher of Moses. The Sepher Yetzirah says of theTenth Path, Malkuth, that \"it causes an influence to flow from the Prince ofCountenances, the archangel of Kether, and is the solirce of illumination of allthe lights of the universe.\" Thus plainly do we learn that not only does spiritflow out into manifestation in matter, but matter by its own energy draws spiritinto manifestation, an important point for the Ptactitioner of magic, for itteaches him that he is justified[Page 118]in his operations and that man is not required to wait upon the word of theLord, but may call upon God to hear him.Mystical Qabala Page 7921. The angels of Kether, operating in the Yetziratic world, are the Chaioth haQadesh, Holy Living Creatures, and their name carries the mind to the ChariotVision of Ezekiel and the Four Holy Creatures before the Throne. The fact thatthe four aces of the Tarot, assigned to Kether, are regarded as representing theroots of the four elements of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water further bears out thisassociation. We may look, then, to Kether as the fountain-head of the elements.This concept clears up many occult and metaphysical difficulties that occur ifwe limit their operation to the astral plane and regard elementals as littlebetter than devils, as Some schools of transcendental thought appear to do.22. The whole question of the angels,archons,and elementals is a very vexed andvery important one in occultism, because its practical application to magic isimmediate.Christian thought can tolerate with an effort the idea of archangels, but theministering spirits, the messengers who are flames of fire, and the heavenlybuilders, are alien to its theology; God, alone and in an instant, made theheavens and earth. The Great Architect of the universe is also the bricklayer.Not so does esoteric science. The initiate knows the legions of spiritual beingswho are agents of God's will and the vehicles of creative activity. It isthrough these that he works, by the grace of their ruling archangel. But anarchangel cannot be conjured by any spell, however potent. Rather is it thatwhen we effect an operation of the Sphere of a particular Sephirah, thearchangel works through us for the fulfilment of its mission. The art of themagician therefore lies in ahgning himself with cosmic force in order that theoperation he desires to perform may come about as a part of the working ofcosmic activities. If he be truly purified and dedicated, this will be the casewith all his desires; and if he be not truly purified and dedicated, he is noadept, and his word is not a word of power.23. It is interesting to note that in the World of Assiah the title of theSphere of Kether is Rashith ha Gilgalim, or First -wirlings, thus indicatingthat the rabbis were acquainted with the Nebular Theory before science wasacquainted with the telescope. The manner in which the ancients deduced thebasic facts of cosmogony by purely intuitive means and the use of the method ofcorrespondences, centuries before the invention and perfection of theinstruments of precision which enabled modern man to make the same discoveriesfrom another angle, must be a matter of perpetual amazement to anyone who comesto the traditional philosophy unbiased.24. As above, so below. The microcosm corresponds to the macrocosm, and we musttherefore seek in man the Kether above the head which shines with a pure whitebrilliance in Adam Kadmon, the Heavenly Man. The rabbis call it the Yechidah,the Divine Spark; the Egyptians call it the Sab; the Hindus call it theThousand-petalled Lotus. But under all these names we have the same idea-thenucleus of.pure spirit which emanates but does not indwell its manymanifestations upon the planes of form.25. It is said that never while in incarnation can we rise to the consciousnessof Kether in Atziluth and retain the physical vehicle intact against our return.Even as Enoch walked with God and was not, so the man that has the vision ofKether is disrupted so far as the vehicle of incarnation is concerned. Why thismust be is readily discerned when we remember that we cannot enter into a modeof consciousness save by reproducing it in Mystical Qabala Page 80ourselves, just as music means nothing to us unless the heart sings with it. Iftherefore we reproduce in ourselves the mode of being of that which has neitherform nor activities, it follows that we must free ourselves from form andactivity. If we succeed in doing so, that which is held together by theform-mode of consciousness will fall apart and return to its elements. Thusdissolved, it cannot be reassembled by returning consciousness.Therefore when we aspire to the Vision of Kether in Atziluth we must be preparedto enter into the Light and come not forth again.26. This does not imply that Nirvana is annihilation, as an[Page 120]ignorant rendering of Eastern philosophy has taught European thought; but itdoes imply a complete change of mode or dimension. What we shall be when we findourselves ranked with the Holy Living Creatures, we do not know, and none whoachieved the vision of Kether in Atziluth have returned to tell us; buttradition avers that there are those who have done so, and that they areintimately concerned with the evolution of humanity and are the prototypes ofthose supermen concerning whom all races have a tradition; a tradition which,unfortunately, of recent years has been cheapened and debased by pseudo-occultteaching. Whatever these beings may or may not be, it is safe to say that theyhave neither astral form nor human personality, but are as flames in the firewhich is God. The state of the soul which has attained Nirvana may best belikened to a wheel that has lost its rim and whose spokes have become rays thatpenetrate and interpenetrate the whole creation; a centre of radiation to whoseinfluence no limit is set save that of its own dynamism, and which maintains itsidentity as a nucleus of energy.27. The Spiritual Experience assigned to Kether is said to be Union with God.This is the end and aim of all mystical experience, and if we look for any othergoal we are as those who build a house in the world of illusion. Anything thatholds him back from the straight path to this goal is felt by the mystic to be abond that binds, and as such to be broken All that holds consciousness to form,all desires other than the one desire-these are to him evils, and from thestandpoint of his philosophy he is right, and to act otherwise would invalidatehis technique.28. But this is not the only test which the mystic has to face; it is requiredof him that he shall fufil the requirements of the planes of form before he isfree to commence his withdrawal and escape from form. There is a Left-hand Paththat leads to Kether, the Kether of the Qliphoth, which is the Kingdom of Chaos.If he embarks upon the Mystic Path prematurely it is thither he goes, and not tothe Kingdom of Light. To the man who is naturally of the Mystic Path thediscipline of form is uncongenial, and it is the subtlest of temptations toabandon the struggle with the life of form that resists his mastery and retreatback up the planes before the nadir has been rounded and the lessons of formhave been learnt. Form is the matrix in which the fluidic consciousness is heldtill it acquires an organisation proof against dispersal; till it becomes anucleus of individuality differentiated out of the amorphous sea of pure being.If the matrix be broken too soon, before the fluidic consciousness had becomeset as an organised system of stresses Mystical Qabala Page 81stereotyped by repetition, consciousness settles back again into formlessness,even as the clay returns to mud if freed from the supporting restraint of themould before it has set. If there is a mystic whose mysticism produces mundaneincapacity or any form of dissociation of consciousness, we know that the mouldhad been broken too soon for him, and he must return to the discipline of formuntil its lesson has been learnt and his consciousness has attained a coherentand cohesive organisation that not even Nirvana can disrupt. Let him hew woodand carry water in the service of the Temple if he will, but let him not profaneits holy place with his pathologies and immaturities.29. The virtue assigned to Kether is that of Attainment, the Completion of theGreat Work, to use a term borrowed from the alchemists. Without completion therecan be no attainment, and without attainment no completion. Good intentionsweigh light in the scale of cosmic justice; it is by our completed work that weare known. True, we have all eternity in which to complete it, but complete itwe must, even to the final Yod. There is no mercy in perfect justice save thatwhich gives us leave to try again.30. Kether, viewed from the standpoint of form, is the crown of the kingdom ofoblivion.Unless we have realisation of the nature of the life of the pure white light weshall have little temptation to strive for the Crown which is not of this orderof being at all; and if we have this realisation, then are we free from thebondage of manifestation and can speak to all forms as one having authority.CHAPTER XVICHOKMAH, THE SECOND SEPHIRAHTITLE: Chokmah, Wisdom.

Every phase of evolution commences by being in a state of unstable force andproceeds through organisation to equilibrium. Equilibrium having been achieved,no further development is possible without once more oversetting the stabilityand passing through a phase of contending forces.Mystical Qabala Page 83As we have already seen, Kethet is the Point formulated in the Void. Accordingto Euclid's definition, a point has position but no dimensions. If, however, apoint may be conceived of as extending through space, it becomes a line. Thenature of the organisation and evolution of the Three Supernals is so remotefrom our experience that we can only conceive of them symbolically; but if weconceive of the Primordial Point which is Kether as being extended into the linewhich is Chokmah, we shall have as adequate a symbolic representation as we mayhope to achieve at our present state of understanding.2. This forth-flowing energy, represented by the straight line or the upliftedrod of power) is essentially dynamic. It is, in fact, the primary dynamism, forwe cannot conceive the crystallisation of Kether in space as a dynamic process;it partakes rather of a staticism-of the limiting of the formless and free inthe bonds of form, tenuous as that form may be in our eyes.3. The limits of the organisation of such a form having been reached, theever-inflowing force of the Unmanifest transcends its limitations, demandingfresh modes of development, establishing fresh relationships and stresses. It isthis out-driving of unorganised, uncompensated force which is Chokmab, andbecause Chokmah is a dynamic Sephirah, ever out-flowing in boundless energy, wedo well to look upon it as a channel for the passage of force rather than areceptable for the storage of force.4. Chokmah is not an organising Sephirah, but it is the Great Stimulator of theUniverse.It is from Chokmah that Binah, the Third Sephirah, receives its influx ofemanation, and Binah is the first of the organising, stabilising Sephiroth. It[Page 124]is not possible to understand either of the paired Sephiroth without consideringits mate; therefore in order to understand Chokmah we shall have to saysomething about Binah.Let it be noted, then, that Binah is assigned to the planet Saturn and is calledthe Superior Mother.5. In Binah and Chokmah we have the archetypal Positive and Negative; theprimordial Maleness and Femaleness, established while \"countenance beheld notcountenance\" and manifestation was incipient. It is from these primary Pairs ofOpposites that the Pillars of the Universe spring, between which is woven theweb of Manifestation.6. As we have already noted, the Tree of Life is a diagram matic representationof me Universe on which the positive and negative, male and female aspects arerepresented by the two flanking Pillars of Mercy and Severity. It may seemstrange to uninstructed thought that the title of Mercy should be given to themale or positive Pillar, and that of Severity to the female Pillar; but when itis realised that the dynamic male type of force is the stimulator of upbuildingand evolution, and that the female type of force is the builder of forms, itwill be seen that the nomenclature is apt; for form, although it is the builderand organiser, is also the limiter; each form that is built must in turn beoutgrown, lose its Mystical Qabala Page 84usefulness, and so become a hindrance to evolving life, and therefore thebringerin of dissolution and decay, which lead on to death. The Father is theGiver of life; but the Mother is the Giver of death, because her womb is thegate of ingress to matter, and through her life is ensouled in form, and no formcan be either infinite or eternal. Death is implicit in birth.7. It is between these two polarising aspects of manifestation-the SupernalFather and the Supernal Mother-that the web of Life is woven; souls going backand forth between them like a weaver's shuttle. In our individual lives, in ourphysiological rhythms, and in the history of the rise and rall of nations, weobserve the same rhythmic periodicity.8. In these; the first paired Sephiroth, we have the key to sex-the pair ofbiological opposites, maleness and femaleness.But the pairing of opposites does not only occur in type, it also occurs intime, and we have alternating epochs in our lives, in our physiologicalprocesses, and in the history of nations, during which activity and passivity,construction and destruction alternately prevail; the knowledge of theperiodicity of these cycles is part of the secret, guarded, ancient wisdom ofthe initiates, and is worked out astrologically and Qabalistically.9. The Magical Image of Chokmah and the symbols assigned toit bear out thisidea. The Magical Image is that of a bearded male, bearded to indicate maturity;the father who has proved his manhood, not the untried virgin male. The symboliclanguage speaks plainly, and the lingam of the Hindus and the phallus of theGreeks are the male generative organ in their respective tongues. Thestanding-stone, the tower, and the uplifted rod all signify the same virilemember at its most potent.10. It must not be thought, however, that Chokmah is a phallic or sexual symboland nothing else. It is primarily a dynamic or positive symbol, for maleness isa form of dynamic force, just as femaleness is a form of static, latent, orpotential force, inert till stimulus be given. The whole is greater than thepart, and Chokmah and Binah are wholes of which sex is a part. In understandingthe relationship which sex has to polarising force as a whole, we find the keyto the right understanding of sex, and we can assess against a cosmic standardthe teachings of psychology and morality relating thereto. We c~n also see howit comes about that the subconscious mind of man can represent the sexes by somany and such diverse symbols, as the Freudians aver; and why sublimation of thesexual instinct is possible, as the moralists aver. Manifestation, then, issexual insomuch as it takes place always in terms of the pairs of opposites; andsex is cosmic and spiritual because it has its roots in the Three Supernals. Wemust learn not to dissociate the airy flower from the earthy root, for theflower that is cut off from its root fades, and its seeds are barren; whereasthe root, secure in mother earth, can produce flower after flower and bringtheir fruit to maturity. Nature is greater and truer than conventional morality,which is often[Page 126]Mystical Qabala Page 85nothing but taboo and totemism. Happy the people whose morality embodiesNature's laws, for they shall lead har monious lives and increase and multiplyand possess the earth. Unhappy the people whose morality is a savage system oftaboos designed to propitiate an imaginary Moloch of a deity, for they shall besterile and sinful. Equally unhappy the people whose morality outrages thesanctity of natural process and in plucking the flower has no regard for thefruit, for they shall be diseased of body and corrupt of estate.11. In Chokmah, then, we must see both the creative Word which said \"Let therebe light,\" and the lingam of Siva and the phallus adored by the Bacchantes. Wemust learn to recognise dynamic force, and revere it wherever we see it, for itsGod-name is Jehovah Tetragrammaton. We see it in the spread tail of the peacockand the iridescence of the neck of the dove; but we also hear it in the yowl ofthe tom-cat and smell it in the stench of the he-goat. Likewise we meet it inthe colonising adventurers of the most virile epochs of our history, notablythose of Elizabeth and Victoria-both women! We see it again in the man diligentin his toil, strenuous in his profession, in order that his home may be providedfor. All these are types of Chokmah, whose additional titles are Abba-Father. Inall these manifestations let us see the father, the giver of life to the unbornas well as the male lusting after its mate; thus we shall get a truerperspective in matters of sex. The Victorian attitude, in its reaction againstRestoration grossness, practically arrived at the standard of the most primitivetribes, who, travellers tell us, do not associate the union of the sexes withthe production of offspring.12. The colour of Chokmah is said to be grey; in its higher aspects, pearl-grey,iridescent.In this we see the veiling of the pure white light of Kether descending in itspath of emanation towards Binah, whose colour is black.13. The Mundane Chakra, or direct physical manifestation of Chokmah, is said tobe the Zodiac, called in Hebrew Mazloth. We thus see that the ancient rabbisrightly understood the process of the evolution of our solar system.14. The Yetziratic Text assigned to Chokmah is, as usual, exceedingly obscure inits wording; nevertheless we can gather from it certain illuminating hints. TheSecond Path, as it denominates Chokmah, it calls the Illuminating Intelligence.We have already referred to the creative Word which said \"Let there be light.\"Among the symbols assigned to Chokmah in \"777\" (Mathers-Crowley system) is thatof the Inner Robe of Glory, a gnostic term. These two ideas, taken together,lead on the imagination to the idea of the ensouling life, the illuminatingspirit. It is the male force that implants the fecundating spark in the passiveovum on all planes and transforms its inert latency into the active up-buildingof growth and evolution. It is the dynamic force of life, which is spirit, thatensouls the clay of physical form and constitutes the Inner Robe of Glory thatis worn by all beings in whom is the breath of life. Force embodied in form, andform ensouled by force, is signified by the Illuminating Intelligence and theJnner Robe of Glory.Mystical Qabala Page 8615. The Yetziratic Text also calls Chokmah the Crown of Creation, thus implyingthat, like Kether, it is overshadowing and external to, rather than imminent andabsorbed in, the manifested Universe. Actually it is the virile force of Chokmabwhich gives the impulse to manifestation, and thus is prior to manifestationitselŁ The Voice of the Logos was crying \"Let there be light\" long ere thewaters were separated from the waters and the firmament appeared. This idea isfurther borne out in the phrase of the Yetziratic Text which speaks of Chokmahas the Splendour of Unity, equalling it, thus clearly indicating its affinity toKether, Unity, rather than to the planes of dualistic form. The word splendour,as used here, clearly indicates an emanation, or shining forth, and teaches usto think of Chokmah as the emanating influence of pure being rather than as athing in itself.This again leads us on to a truer apprehension of sex. Let it be made quiteclear, however, that the sphere of Chokmah has nothing to do with fertilitycults as such, save that maleness, dynamic force, is the primary life-giver andcaller into manifestation. Though[Page 128]the higher and lower manifestations of dynamic force are the same in essence,they are upon different levels; Priapus is not identical with Jehovah.Nevertheless, the root of Priapus is to be found in Jehovah, and themanifestation of God the Father is to be found in Priapus, as is indicated bythe fact that the rabbis call Chokmah the Yod of Tetragrammaton, and Yod isidentical with lingam in their phraseology.16. It is curious that the Sepher Ye~irah says of two of the Sephiroth that theyare exalted above every head-a contradictory statement; yet in the fact that itis made with regard to Chokmah and Malkuth there is illumination for us if weponder its significance.Chokmah is the Supernal Father, Malkuth is the Inferior Mother, and the textwhich declares her exaltation above every head also says that she sitteth uponthe throne of Binah, the Superior Mother, the negative counterpart of Chokmah.Now Chokmah is the most abstract form of force, and Malkuth is the densest formof matter; so in this statement we have a hint that each of this pair of extremeopposites is the supreme manifestation of its own type; and both are equallyholy in their different ways.17. We must distinguish between the fertility rite, the vitality rite, and theillumination or inspiration rite, which calls down the Pentecostal tongues offlame. The fertility cult aims at plain and simple reproduction, whether offlocks, fie]ds, or wives; it belongs to Yesod, and has nothing whatever to dowith the vitality cult, which belongs to Netzacb, the sphere of Venus-Aphrodite.This concerns certain very important esoteric teaching on the subject of thevitalising or magnetic influences which the sexes have on each other, quiteapart from physical intercourse, and will be dealt with when Netzach, the sphereof Venus, comes to be considered.18. The Rite of Chokmah, if such it can be called, is concerned with the influxof cosmic energy. It is formless, being the pure impulse of dynamic creation;and being formless, the creation it gives rise to can assume any and every form;hence the possibility of sublimating creative force from its purely Priapicaspect.Mystical Qabala Page 8719. So far as I know, there is no formal magical ceremony of any of the ThreeSupernals.They can only be contacted through participation in their essential nature.Kether, pure being, is contacted when we win to realisation of the nature ofexistence without parts, attributes or dimensions. This experience is aptlycalled the Trance of Annihilation, and those who experience it walk with God andare not, for God has taken them; therefore is the spiritual experience assignedto Kether that of Divine Union, of which it is said that those who experience itenter into the Light and come not forth again.20. In order to contact Chokmah we must experience the rush of the dynamiccosmic energy in its pure form; an energy so tremendous that mortal man is fusedinto disruption by it. It is recorded that when Semele, mother of Dionysos, sawZeus her divine lover in his god-form as the Thunderer, she was blasted andburnt, and gave birth to her divine son prematurely. The spiritual experienceassigned to Kether is the Vision of God face to face; and God (Jehovah) said toMoses, \"Thou canst not look upon my face and live.\"21. But although the sight of the Divine Father blasts mortals as with fire, theDivine Son comes familiarly among them and can be invoked by the appropriatentes-Bacchanalia in the case of the Son of Zeus, and the Eucharist in the caseof the Son of Jehovah. Thus we see that there is a lower form of manifestation,which \"shews us the Father,\" but that this rite owes its validity solely to thefact that it derives its Illuminating Intelligence, its Jnner Robe of Glory,from the Father, Chokmah.II22. The grade of initiation corresponding to Chokmah is said to be that ofMagus, and the magical weapons assigned to that grade are the phallus and theInner Robe of Glory. This teaches us that these symbols have a microcosmic orpsychological significance as well as a macrocosmic or mystical one. The InnerRobe of Glory must surely signify the Inner Light[Page 130]which lighteth every man that cometh into the world~the spiritual vision wherebythe mystic discerns spiritual things, the subjective form of the IlluminatingIntelligence referred to in the Yetziratic Text.23. The phallus or lingam is given as one of the magical weapons of the initiateoperating the grade of Chokmah; this tells us that a knowledge of the spiritualsignificance of sex and the cosmic significance of polarity concern this grade.Any-one who can see beneath the surface in things mystical and magical cannotfail to be aware of the fact that in the understanding of the tremendous andmysterious potency (which we call sex in one of its manifestations) lies the keyto a very great deal. It is not for nothing that sexual imagery pervades thevisions of the seer, from the Song of Songs to The Interior Castle.Mystical Qabala Page 8824. It must not be thought from this that I advocate orgiastic rites as the Wayof Initiation; but I may as well say plainly that without the rightunderstan4ing of the esoteric aspect of sex, the Path is a blind alley. Freudspoke the truth to this generation when he pointed to sex as a key topsychopathology; he erred, in my opinion, when he made it the only key to thenine-chambered soul of man. As there can be no health of subconsciousnesswithout harmony of sex-life, so there can be no positive or dynamic working uponthe plane of superconsciousness unless the laws of polarity are understood andobserved. To many mystics, seekitig refuge from matter in spirit, this may be ahard saying, but experience will prove it a true one; therefore it must be said,though there may be few thanks for saying it.25. The tremendous down-rush of the Chokmah-force invoked through the DivineFour-lettered Name comes from the macrocosmic Yod to the microcosmic Yod, and isthen sublimated. Unless the subconscious mind is free from dissociations andrepressions, and all the parts of the many~sided nature of man are co-ordinatedand synchronised, reactions and pathological symptoms are the result of thatdown-rush. This does not mean that the invoker of Zeus is necessarily aworshipper of Priapus, but it does mean that no man can sublimate adissociation. When the channel is free from obstructions the down-rushing forcecan swing round the nadir and become an up-rushing force which can be directedto any sphere or turned into any channel that is desired; but, like it or not,it will be a down-rushing force before it is an up-rushing one, and unless ourfeet are firmly planted on elemental earth we shall be like bursting wine-skins.26. Every practical occultist knows that Freud has spoken the truth, even thoughit is not the whole truth, but they are afraid to say so for fear of beingaccused of phallic worship and orgiastic practices. These things have theirplace, though it is not in the Temple of the Holy Spirit, and to deny them theirplace is a folly for which the Victorian age paid dearly in a rich harvest ofpsychopathology.27. Whenever we are working dynamically upon any plane we are operating theRight-hand Pillar of the Tree and derive our primary energy from the Yod-forceof Chokmah. In this connection we must refer to the fact that the microcosmiccorrespondence of Chokmah is given as the left side of the face. The macrocosmicand microcosmic correspondences play an important part in the practicalworkings. The Macrocosm, or Great Man, is, of course, the universe itself; andthe microcosm is the individual man. It is said that man is the only being thathas a fourfold nature exactly corresponding in its levels to the cosmos. Theangels lack the lower planes, and the animals lack the higher planes.28. The references to the microcosm should not, of course, be taken crudely asrepresenting the parts of the physical body; the references are to the aura andthe functions of the magnetic currents in the aura, and it must always be bornein mind, as the Swami Vivekananda points out, that what is on the right in themale is on the left in the female. In addition to this it must be rememberedthat what is positive on the physical plane is negative on the astral plane; itis positive again on the mental plane and negative Mystical Qabala Page 89on the spiritual plane, as is indicated in the twining black and white serpentsof the Caduceus of Mercury.[Page 132]If this Caduceus be placed upon the Tree when the Tree is marked off torepresent the Four Worlds of the Qabalists, a glyph is formed which reveals theworkings of the Law of Polarity in relation to the Planes. This is a veryimportant glyph, and yields a great deal to meditation.29. From this we learn that when the soul is in a female incarnation it willfunction negatively inAssiah and Briah, but positively in Yetzirah and Atziluth.In other words, a woman is physically and mentally negative, but psychically andspiritually positive, and the reverse holds good for a man. In initiates,however, there is a considerable degree of compensation, for each learns thetechnique of both positive and negative psychic methods. The Divine Spark, whichis the nucleus of every living soul, is, of course, bi-sexual, containing theroots of both aspects, as does Kether, to which it corresponds. In the morehighly evolved souls the compensating aspect is developed in some degree atleast. The purely female woman and the purely male man prove to be oversexed asjudged by civilised standards, and can only find an appropriate place inprimitive societies, where fertility is the primary demand that society makesupon its women, and hunting and fighting are the constant occupation of the men.30. This does not mean, however, that the physical functions of the sexes areperverted in the initiate, or that the configuration of the body is modified.Esoteric science teaches that the physical form and racial type which the soulassumes in each incarnation are determined by destiny, or Karma, and that thelife has to be worked out and lived accordingly. It is inadvisable for us toplay tricks with our type, racial or physical, and we should always accept it asthe basis of our operations, and choose our methods accordingly. There arecertain operations and certain offices in the lodge for which a male vehicle ismore suitable than a female, and when practical work is on hand the officers ina ceremony are selected on type; but when the routine training of an initiate isin progress it is the custom to let everyone take turns at the different officesin order that they may learn to handle the different types of force and sobecome equilibrated.31. Benjamin Kidd, in his very stimulating book, The Science of Power, pointsout that the highest type of human being approximates to the infantile. Weobserve the enormous relative size of the head as compared with the body-weightin the infant, and that the secondary sexual characteristics are not present. Wefind the same tendency appearing in a modified form in the civilised adult. Thehighest type of man is not a hirsute gorilla, nor is the highest type of womanan exaggerated mammal. The tendency of evolution in civilisation is to anapproxiniation of type between the sexes so far as the secondary sexualcharacteristics are concerned. What percentage of city-dwelling males could growa really patriarchal beard? The primary sexual character, however, must bemaintained unimpaired or the race speedily dies Out, and we have no reason tobelieve that this is the Mystical Qabala Page 90case even among our most epicene moderns, who fill the divorce courts withabundant evidence of their overflowing philoprogenitiveness.32. These things we can understand in the light that is thrown on them when theyare\"placed upon the Tree.\" The two Pillars, the positive under Chokmah and thenegative under Binab, correspond respectively to the Jda and Pingala of the Yogasystems. These two magnetic currents, running in the aura parallel to the spine,are called the Sun and Moon currents. In a male incarnation we workpredominantly with the Sun current, the fertiliser; in a female incarnation wework predominantly with the moon-forces. If we desire to work with the Oppositetype of force to that with which we are naturally endowed, we have to do so byusing our natural mode as th~ basis of operations and, as it were, \"cannoningoff the cushion,\" The male who wants to use the moon-forces employs devices thatenable him to get his natural sun-force reflected, and the female who wants touse the sun-forces employs a device whereby she is enabled to focus them uponherself and reflect them. On the physical plane the sexes mate, and the manbegets a child upon the woman, thus[Page 134]availing himself of her moon-powers. The woman, on the other hand, desiringcreation and unable to compass it single~ handed, entices the male through hisdesires till he bestows upon her his sun-force and she is impregnated.33. In magical workings the man or woman who desires to work with the oppositetype of force to that of their physical vehicle, and it is part of the routineof occult training that they should do so, shifts the level of consciousness onto a plane on which they find themselves of the requisite polarity, and worksthereon. The priest of Osiris sometimes employs the elemental spirits tosupplement his polarity, and the priestess of Isis invokes angelic influences.34. Because manifestation takes place through the Pairs of Opposites, theprinciple of polarity is implicit not only in the macrocosm but also in themicrocosm. By understanding it, and knowing how to avail ourselves of thepotentialities it affords, we can raise our natural powers far above theirnormal; we can use our environment as a thrust-block; we can look for the potentChokmah-force in books, in our racial tradition, in our religion, in our friendsand associates; from all these we can receive the stimulus that fecundates usand makes us creative mentally, emotionally, and dynamically. We make ourenvironment play Chokmah to our Binah. Equally, we can play Chokmah to itsBinah. Upon the subtle planes polarity is not fixed, but is relative; that whichis more forceful than ourselves is positive towards us, and renders us negativetowards itself; that which is less forceful than we are in any given aspect isnegative towards us, and we can assume the positive role towards it. Thisfluidic, ever~fluctuating subtle polarity is one of the most important points inthe practical workings; if we understand it and avail ourselves of it, we can dosome very remarkable things and put our lives and our relations with ourenvironment on an altogether different basis.Mystical Qabala Page 9135. We must learn to know when we can function as Chokmah and beget deeds uponthe world; and when we had best function as Binah, and make our environmentfertilise us so that we become productive. We must never forget thatself-fertilisation involves sterility in a few generations, and that we ~nustever and again be fertilised by the medium in which we are working. There mustbe an interplay of polarity between us and whatever we have set out to do, andwe must always be on the alert to find polarising influences, whether intradition, or in books, or in fellow-workers in the same field, or even in thevery opposition and antagonism of enemies; for there is just as much polarisingforce in a hearty hatred as there is in love, if we know how to use it. We musthave stimulus if we are to create anything, even a useful life weH lived.Chokmah is the cosmic stimulus.Whatever stimulates is assigned to Chokmah in the classification of the Tree.Sedatives are assigned to Binah. We shall obtain further insight into thisprinciple of cosmic polarity as we study Binah, the Third Sephirah, for it ishardly possible to understand the implications of Chokmah without reference toits polarising opposite, with which it always functions. We will, therefore,carry no further our study of polarity at the present time, but conclude ourexamination of Chokmah by reference to the cards attributed to it in the Tarotpack, and resume our research into this most significant subject when Binah hasafforded us further data.III36. As was noted in the chapter upon Kether, the four suits of the Tarot packare assigned to the four elements, and we saw that the four aces represented theroots of the powers of these elements, The four twos are assigned to Chokmah,and represent the polarised functioning of these elements in harmonised balance;therefore a two is always a card of harmony.37. The two of Wands, which is assigned to the element of Fire, is called theLord of Dominion. The wand is essentially a male phallic symbol, and isattributed to Chokmah, so we may take this card as meaning polarisation; thepositive that has found its mate in the negative, and is in equilibrium. There[Page 136]is no antagonism or resistance to the Lord of Dominion, hu~ a contented landaccepts his rule; Binah, fulfilled, accepts her mate.38. The two of Cups (Water) is called the Lord of Love and here again we havethe concept of harmonious polarisation.39. The two of Swords (Air) is called the Lord of Peace Restored, indicatingthat the disruptive force of Swords is in temporary equilibrium.Mystical Qabala Page 9240. The two of Pentacles (Earth) is called the Lord of Harmonious Change. Here,as in Swords, we see a modification of the essential nature of the elementalforce by its polarismg opposite, thus inducing equilibrium. The disruptive forceof Swords is restored to peace, and the inertia and resistance of Earth becomes,when polarised by the influence of Chokmah, a balanced rhythm.41. These four cards indicate the Chokmah-force in polarity, that is to say theessential balance of power as it manilests in the Four Worlds of the Qabalists.When they appear in a divination they indicate power in equilibrium. They do notindicate a dynamic force, as might be expected where Chokmah is concerned;because Chokmah, being one of the Supernals, its force is positive upon thesubtle planes, and consequently negative upon the planes of form. The negativeaspect of a dynamic force is represented by equilibrium, polarity. The negativeaspect of a negative potency is represented by destruction, as is shown in theglyph of Kali, the terrible wife of Siva, girdled with skulls and dancing uponthe body of her husband.42. This concept gives us a key to another of the many problems of the Tree-therelative polarity of the Sephiroth. As has previously been explained, eachSephirah is negative in its relation with those above it, from which it receivesthe influx of the emanations, and positive in relation to those beneath it,which proceed from it, and to which it therefore acts as emanator. Certain ofthe paired Sephiroth are, however, more definitely positive or more definitelynegative in their nature. For instance, Chokmah is a positive Positive,and Binabis a positive Negative. Chesed is a negative positive, and Geburah a negativeNegative. Netzach (Venus) and Hod (Mercury) are said to be hermaphroditic.Yesod (Luna) is a positive Negative, and Malkuth (Earth) is a negative Negative.Neither Kether nor Tiphareth are predominantly male or female. In Kether thePairs of Opposites are latent and have not yet declared themselves; in Tiphareththey are in perfect equilibrium.43. There are two ways in which transmutation can be effected on the Tree; andthese are indicated by two of the glyphs which are superimposed upon the Sephiroth; one of these is the Glyph of the Three Pillars, and the other is the Glyphof the Lightning Flash. The Pillars have been already described; the LightningFlash simply indicates the order of emanation of the Sephiroth, zigzagging fromChokmah to Binah and from Binah to Chesed, backwards and forwards across theTree. If transmutation takes place according to the Lightning Flash, the forcechanges its type; if according to the Pillar:s, it remains of the same type, buton a higher or lower are as the case may be.44. This sounds very complex and abstract, but examples will soon serve to showit to be simple and practical when understood. Take the problem of thesublimation of sex-force, which besets the psychotherap;sts, concerning whichthey talk so glibly and say so little.In Malkuth, which in the microcosm is the physical body, sex-force is in termsof ovum and spermatozoon; in Yesod, which is the etheric double, it is in termsof magnetic force, concerning which nothing is known to orthodox psychology, butconcerning which we shall have a good deal to say under the heading of theappropriate Sephirah. Hod and Netzach are on the astral plane, and in Hod wefind that the sex-force is expressed in Mystical Qabala Page 93visual images, and in Netzach in another and altogether subtler type ofmagnetism popularly referred to as \"(salt)~ It.\" In Tiphareth, theChrist-centre, the force becomes spiritual inspiration, illumination, the influxfrom the higher consciousness. If it is positive in type, it becomes theDionysiac inspiration, a divine[Page 138]inebriation; and if it is negative, it becomes the impersonal, all-harmonisingChrist-love.45. When the transmutation is worked upon the Pillars we are impressed by thetruth of the ironical French phrasePlus qu'il change, plus c'est Ia meme chose. Chokmah, pure dynamism, purestimulus without formed expression, in Chesed becomes the upbuilding, Organisingaspect of evolution; anabolism, as distinguished from the katabolism of Geburab.In Chesed the Chokmah force becomes that peculiarly subtle form of magnetismwhich gives power of leadership and is the root of greatness. Equally, on theLeft-hand Pillar, the force-restraining Binah becomes the form-destroyingGeburah, and again the maker of magical images, Mercury-Hermes-Thoth.46. From time to time the symbols of occult science have leaked out into popularknowledge, but the uninitiated have not understood the method of arranging thesesymbols in their pattern as the Tree, nor of applying to them the alchem;calprinciples of transmutation and distillation wherein lie • the real secrets oftheir use.CHAPTER XVIIBINAH, THE THIRD SEPHIRAHTITLE: Binah, Understanding.

Binah is the third member of the Supernal Triangle, and the task of itselucidation will be both extended and simplified because we can study it in thelight of Chokmah, which balances it on the opposing Pillar of the Tree. It isnever possible to understand a Sephirah if we consider it apart from itsposition on the Tree, because this position Mystical Qabala Page 95indicates its cosmic relationships; we see it in perspective, as it were, andcan deduce whence it comes and whither it goes; what influences have gone to itsmaking, and what it contributes to the scheme of things entire.2. Binah represents the female potency of the universe, even as Chokmahrepresents the male. As already noted, they are Positive and Negative; Force andForm. Each heads its Pillar, Chokmah at the head of the Pillar of Mercy, andBinah at the head of the Pillar of Severity. It may be thought that this is anunnatural distribution; that the Supernal Mother should preside over themercies, and the male force of the universe over the seventies.But we must not sentimentalise these things. We are dealing with cosmicprinciples, not personalities; and even the symbols under which they arepresented give us insight if we have eyes to see. Freud would not havequarrelled with the attribution of Binab to the head of the Pillar of Severity,for he has a great deal to say about the image of the Terrible Mother.3. Kether, Eheieh, I Am, is pure being, all-potential but non-active; when aflowing-forth of activity takes place from it, we call that activity Chokmah; itis this descending stream of pure activity which is the dynamic force of theuniverse, and all dynamic force belongs to this category.4. It must be remembered that the Sephiroth are states, not places. Whereverthere is a state of pure, unconditioned being, without parts or activities, itis referred to Kether.Thus into these ten pigeon-holes of our metaphysical card-index system we cansort our ideas of the whole of the manifested universe without the necessity ofremoving any object from its place in nature as it appears to our understanding.In other words, wherever we see pure energy functioning, we know that theunderlying force is that of Chokmah; this enables us to see the intrinsicidentity in type of all manner of phenomena which at first sight appear entirelyunrelated; for we learn by the Qabalistic method to refer them according totheir type to the different Sephiroth, thus enabling ourselves to link them upwith all manner of cognate ideas according to the system of correspondencesexplained on a previous page. This is the method of the subconscious mind, whichit pursues automatically; the occultist trains his conscious mind in the use ofthe same method. Incidentally we may note that whenever individuals are workingdirectly off the subconscious, as occurs in artistic genius, in lunacy, and indream or trance, this method is used.5. It may seem strange to the reader that this digression concerning Chokmahshould be included under the heading of Binah, but it is only in the light ofits polarity with Chokmah that Binah can be understood; and equally, we shallhave a great deal more to add to our explanation of Chokmah now that we have gotBinah to compare it with. Each of the Pairs ofopposites throws light on theother and is incomprehensible alone.6. But to return to Binah. The Qabalists state that it is emanated by Chokmah.Let us translate this statement into other terms. It is an occult maxim, whichis, I believe, confirmed by the researches of Einstein, though I have not theknowledge necessary to correlate his findings with the esoteric doctrines, thatforce never moves in a straight line, Mystical Qabala Page 96but always curve vast as the universe, and therefore eventually returns whenceit issued forth, but upon a higher arc, for the universe has progressed since itstarted. It follows, then, that force proceeding thus, dividing and redividingand moving at tangential angles, will eventually arrive at a state ofinterlocking stresses and some manner of stability; a stability which tends tobe overset in course of time as fresh forces are emanated from it intomanifestation and introduce new factors with which adjustment has to be made.[Page 142]7. It is this state of stability, which is arrived at by the inter acting forceswhen they act and react and come to a standstill, which is the basis of form, asis exemplified in the atom, which is nothing more nor less than a constellationof electrons, each of which is a vortex, or whirlpool. The stability thusachieved, which, be it noted, is a condition and not a thing in itself, is whatQabalists call Binah, the Third Sephirah. Wherever there is a state ofinteracting stresses which have achieved stability, the Qabalists refer thecondition to Binah. For instance, the atom, being for all practical purposes thestable unit of the physical plane, is a manifestation'of the Binah type offorce. All social organisations on which the dead hand of unprogressivenessweighs heavily, such as the Chinese civilisation before the revolution, or ourolder universities, are said to be under the influence of Binah. To Binah areattributed the Greek God Chronos (who is none other than Father Time) and theRoman God Saturn. It will be observed the importance attached to time, in otherwords to age, in these Binah institutions; only grey hairs are venerable;ability alone carries little weight. That is to say, only those who arecongenial to Chronos can succeed in such an environment.8. Binah, the Great Mother, sometimes also called Marah, the Great Sea, is, ofcourse, the Mother of All Living. She is the archetypal womb through which lifecomes into manifestation. Whatsoever provides a form to serve life as a vehicleis of Her. It must be remembered, however, that life confined in a form,although it is enabled thereby to organise and so evolve, is much less free thanit was when it was unlimited (though also unorganised) on its own plane.Involvement in a form is therefore the beginning of the death of life. It is astraitening and a limiting; a binding and a constricting. Form checks life,thwarts it, and yet enables it to organise. Seen from the point of view offree-moving force, incarceration in a form is extinction. Form disciplines forcewith a merciless severity.9. The disembodied spirit is immortal; there is nothing of it that can grow oldor die. But the embodied spirit sees deathon the horizon as soon as its day dawns. We can see then how terrible must theGreat Mother appear as She binds free-moving force into the discipline of form.She is death to the dynamic activity of Chokmah; the Chokmah-force dies as itissues into Binah. Form is the discipline of force; therefore is Binah the headof the Pillar of Severity.10. We may conceive that the first Cosmic Night set in, the first Pralaya, orsinking of manifestation to rest, when the Supernal Triangle found stability andequilibrium of force with the emanation and organisation of Binah. All wasdynamic before; all was Mystical Qabala Page 97forthrushing and expansion; but with the coming into manifestation of the Binahaspect there was an interlocking and stabilising, and the old dynamic free flowwas no more.11. That such an interlocking and consequent stabilisation was inevitable in auniverse whose lines of force ever move in curves is a foregone conclusion. Andwe can see, if we observe how the Binah-state was the inevitable outcome of theChokmah-state in a curvilinear universe, that time must move through epochs inwhich either Binah or Chokmah predominate. Before the lines of force hadcompleted their circuit of the manifested universe and begun to return uponthemselves and interlace, all was Chokmah, and dynamism was unrestricted. AfterBinah and Chokmah, as the first Pairs of Opposites, had found equilibrium, allwas Binah, and stability was immovable. But Kether, the Great Emanator,continues to make manifest the Great Unmanifest; force flows in upon theuniverse, and the sum of force is increased. This inflowing force oversets theequilibrium that is arrived at when Chokmah and Binah have acted, reacted, andcome to a stop. Action and reaction commence again, and the Chokmah-phase, aphase in which dynamic force predominates, supervenes upon the static conditionwhich is Binah, and the cycle proceeds once more; equilibrium between the Pairsof Opposites being arrived at in a more complex form-on a higher arc, as it iscalled from the evolutionary point of view-only to be overset again as theever-emanating Kether weighs down the balance[Page 144]in favour of the kinetic principle as opposed to the static principle.12. It will thus be seen that if Kether, the source of all being is conceived ofas the highest good, as it inevitably must he, and the nature of Kether iskinetic and its influence is for ever inclined towards Chokmah, it inevitablyfollows that Binah, the opposite of Chokmah, the perpetual opposer of thedynamic impulses, will be regarded as the enemy of God, the evil one.Saturn-Satan is an easy transition; and so is Time-Death-Devil.Implicit in the ascetic religions such as Christianity and Buddhism is the ideathat woman is the root of all evil, because she is the influence which holds mento a life of form by their desires. Matter is regarded by them as the antinomyof spirit in an eternal, unresolved duality. Christianity is ready enough torecognise the heretical nature of this belief when it is presented to it in theform of Antinomianism; but it does not realise that its own teaching andpractice are equally antinomian when it regards matter as the enemy of spirit,and as such to be abrogated and overcome. This unhappy belief has caused as muchhuman suffering in Christian countries as war and pestilence.13. The Qabalah teaches a wiser doctrine. To it, all the Sephiroth are holy,Malkuth equally with Kether, and Geburah the destroyer with Chesed thepreserver. It recognises that rhythm is the basis of life, not a steady forwardprogress. If we understood this better, how much suffering we should saveourselves, for we should watch the Chokmah and Binah phases succeeding eachother, both in our own lives and the lives of nations,and would realise the deepsignificance of Shakespeare's words when he says: Mystical Qabala Page 98\"There is a tide in the affairs of menWhich taken at the flood leads on to fortune.\"14. Binah is the primordial root of matter, but the full development of matteris not found till we arrive at Malkuth, the material universe. We shall seerepeatedly in the course of our studies that the Three Supernals have theirspecialised expressions on a lower arc in one or another of the six Sephirothwhich form Microprosopos. It is repeatedly said of these that they have theirroots in or are reflections of the higher triad, and these hints have a deepsignificance. Binah links with Malkuth as the root with the fruit. This isindicated in the Yet ziratic text of Malkuth, in which it says: \"She sittethupon the throne of Binah.\" It is for this reason that a hard and fastattribution of the gods of other pantheons to the different Sephiroth isimpracticable.Aspects of Isis are to be found in Binah, Netzach, Yesod, and Malkuth. Aspectsof Osiris are to be found in Chokmah, Chesed, and Tiphareth. This comes outclearly in Greek mythology, wherein the different gods and goddesses are givendescnptive titles. For instance, Diana, the moon-goddess, the virgin huntress,was worshipped at Ephesus as the Many-breasted; Venus, the goddess of femalebeauty and of love, had a temple where she was worshipped as the Bearded Venus.These things teach us some important truths.They teach us to look for the principle behind the multiform manifestation, andto realise that it assumes different forms on different levels. Life is notquite so simple as the uninformed would like to believe.II15. The meaning of the Hebrew names of the second and third Sephiroth are Wisdomand Understanding, and these are curiously balanced one against the other as ifthe distinction were of primary importance. Wisdom suggests to our minds theidea of accumulated knowledge, of the infinite series of images in the memory;but Understanding conveys to us the idea of a penetration into theirsignificance, a power to perceive their essence and interrelation, which is notnecessarily implicit in wisdom, taken as intellectual knowledge. Thus we get aconcept of an extended series, a chain of associated ideas, in relation toChokmah, which at once correlates with the Chokmah symbol of a straight line.But in regard to Understanding we get the idea of synthesis, of the perceptionof significances[Page 146]which comes when ideas are related one to another, and superimposed,metaphorically speaking, one upon another. in evolutionary series from the denseto the subtle. Thus does the idea of the binding-together Binah-principle comeonce again to our minds.16. These are subtle ways of mind-working, and may appear foolishness to thoseunaccustomed to the initiate's method of using his mind; but the psycho-analystunder stands them and appreciates them at their true significance; and solikewise does the poet when he constructs his cloud-capped towers of imagery.Mystical Qabala Page 9917. The Yetziratic Text stresses the idea of faith, the faith that rests onunderstanding, whose parent is Binah. This is the only place where faith mayrightly rest. A cynic defined faith as the power of believing what you knowisn't true; and this appears to be a fairly accurate definition for themanifestations of faith as they appear in many uninstructed minds, the fruit ofthe discipline of sects unenlightened by mystical consciousness. But in thelight of that consciousness we may define faith as the conscious result ofsuperconscious experience which has not been translated into terms ofbrain-consciousness, and of which, therefore, the normal personality is notdirectly aware, though it nevertheless feels, possibly with great intensity, theeffects, and its emotional reactions are fundamentally and permanently modifiedthereby.18. In the light of this definition we can see how the roots of faith may indeedrest in Binah, Understanding, the synthetic principle of consciousness. Forthere is a form aspect to consciousness as well as to substance, and that aspectwe shall consider in detail when we come to the study of Hod, the basal Sephirahof Binah's Pillar of Severity. Thus we see yet again how the Sephiroth link upamong themselves, and the illumination that comes from observing theirinterrelationships.19. The statement that the roots of Binah are in Amen refers to Kether, for oneof the titles of Kether is Amen. This clearly declares that although Chokmahemanates Binab, we must not pause there when seeking origins, but move back tothe fount of all as it rises from the Unmanifest behind the Veils of NegativeExistence. This concept is brought out very clearly by the Yetziratic Text ofChesed, wherein it says, speaking of spiritual forces: \"They emanate one fromanother by virtue of the primordial emanation, the highest crown, Kether.\"10. We must not be misled or confused in this respect by the fact that theYetziratic Text of Geburah declares that Binah, understanding, emanates from theprimordial depths of Chokmah, Wisdom. Binah is in Kether as well as Chokmah,\"but after another manner.\"In pure being, formless and partless though it is, are the possibilities of bothforce and form; for where there is a positive pole, there is necessarily thecorrelative aspect of a negative pole. Kether is for ever in a state ofbecoming. In fact, I have been told by a Jewish Qabalist that the realtranslation of Eheieh, the God-name of Kether, is \"I will be,\"not \"I am.\" This constant becoming cannot remain static, it must overflow intoactivity; and that activity cannot for ever remain uncorrelated within itself;it must organise; some manner of adjustment of interlocking stresses must bearrived at; thus we have the potentiality of both Chokmah and Binah implicit inKether; for be it said yet again that the Holy Sephiroth are not things, butstates, and that all manifested things exist in one or another of these states,and contain an admixture of these factors in their make-up, so that the whole ofthe manifested universe can be sorted out into its appropriate pigeon-holes inour minds when the glyph of the Tree is establi~~ed there. Indeed, when oncethat glyph is clearly formulated and well estabhshed, the mind uses itautomatically, and the complex phenomena of objective existence sort themselvesout in our understanding. It is for this reason that the student of occultismwho is working in an initiatory school is made to learn the principalcorrespondences of the Ten Holy Sephiroth off by heart, instead of being allowedto depend upon tables of reference. It has often been objected Mystical QabalaPage 100that this is an intolerable waste of time and energy, and that reference to thetables of correspondences,[Page 148]such as Crowley's \"777,\" is quite as good. But experience proves that this isnot the case, and that the esotericist who sets himself to this discipline andrehearses them daily, as the Catholic tells his rosary, is amply repaid by thesubsequent illumination he receives as his mind automatically sorts ou~ theinnumerable changes and chances of mundane life on to the Tree, thus revealingtheir spiritual significance. It must always be borne in mind that the use ofthe Tree of Life is not merely an intellectual exercise; it is a creative art inthe literal meaning of the words, and faculties have to be developed in the mindeven as manual skill is acquired by sculptor or musician.21. The Yetziratic Text specifically refers to Binah as the SanctifyingIntelligence.Sanctification conveys the idea of that which is holy and set apart. The VirginMary is held to be intimately associated with Binah, the Great Mother; and fromthis attribution the mind is led on to the idea of that which brings forth theAll but retains its virginity; in other words, whose creativeness does notinvolve it in the life of its creation, but which remains apart and behind asthe basis of manifestation, the root-substance whence matter arises. Foralthough matter is held to have its roots in Binah, yet matter as we know it isof a very different order of being to the Supernal Sephirah in which its essencelies.Binah, the primordial formative influence, the parent of all form, is behind andbeyond manifesting substance; in other words, is ever-virgin. It is thisformative influence underlying all form-building, this tendency for curvinglines of force to correlate and achieve stability, which is Binah.22. These two basal Sephiroth of the 5upernal Triad are especially referred toas the Father and Mother, Abba and Ama, and their magical images are those ofthe bearded male and the matron, thus representing, not the sex attraction ofNetzach and Yesod, who are represented as maiden and youth, but the maturebeings who have mated and reproduced. We must always distinguish betweenmagnetic sex attraction and reproduction; they are by no means one and the samething; Oft are they even different levels or aspects of the same thing. Hereinis an important occult truth which we will consider in detail in due course.23. Chokmah and Binah, then, represent essential maleness and femaleness intheir creative aspects. They are not phallic irnages as such, but in them is theroot of all life-force. We shall never understand the deeper aspects ofesotericism unless we realise what phailicism really means. It most emphaticallydoes not mean the orgies in the temples of Aphrodite that disgraced thedecadence of the pagan faiths of the ancients and brought about their downfall;it means that everything rests upon the principle of the stimulation of theinert yet all-potential by the dynamic principle which derives its energy directfrom the source of all energy. In this concept lie tremendous keys of knowledge;it is one of the most important points in the Mysteries. It is obvious that sexrepresents one aspect of this factor; it is equally obvious that there are manyothet applications of it which are not Mystical Qabala Page 101sexual. We must not allow any preconceived concept of what constitutes sex, or aconventional attitude towards this great and vital subject, to frighten us awayfrom the great principle of the stimulation or fecundation of the inertall-potential by the active principle. Whosoever is thus inhibited is unfit forthe Mysteries, over whose portal was written the words, \"Know thyself.\"24. Such knowledge does not lead to impurity, for impurity implies a loss ofcontrol that permits forces to override the bounds that Nature has set them.Whoso has not control of his own instincts and passions is no more fitted forthe Mysteries than he who inhibits and dissociates them. Let it be clearlyrealised, however, that the Mysteries do not teach asceticism or celibacy as arequirement of achievement, because they do not regard spirit and matter as anunreconcilable pair of antinomies, but rather as diffe~t levels of the samething. Purity does not consist in emasculatH, but in keeping the differentforces to their proper levels and in their proper places, and not allowing oneto invade another. It teaches that frigidity and impotence are just as muchimperfections,[Page 150]and therefore pathologies of sex, as is uncontrolled lust that destroys itsobject and debases itself.25. Every relationship of manifested existence involves the Binah and Chokmahprinciples, and because sex is such a perfect representation of these it wasused as such by the ancients, who were not troubled by our timidities on thesubject, and took their metaphors from the subject of repro~ duction as freelyas we take ours from the Bible.For to thern reproduction was a sacred process, and they referred to it, notwith ribaldry, but with reverence. If we want to understand them, we mustapproach their teaching on the subject of the life-source and life-force in thesame spirit in which they approached it, and no one whose eyes are not blindedby prejudice, or who does not stand in the shadow thrown by his own unsolvedproblems, can fail to realise that our present-day attitude towards life wouldbe both saner and sweeter for a leavening of pagan common sense and discernment.26. The principles of maleness and femaleness as mamfested in Chokmah and Binahrepresent more than mere positivity and negativity, activity and passivity.Chokmah, the All-begetter, is a vehicle of primal force, the immediatemanifestation of Kether. It is, in fact, Kether in action; for the differentSephiroth do not represent different things, but different functions of the samething, i.e. pure force welling lip into manifestation from the Great Unmanifestwhich is behind the Negative Veils of Existence. Chokmah is pure force, even asthe expansion of petrol as it explodes in the combustion-chamber of an engine ispure force. But just as this expansive force would expand and be lost if therewere no engine to transmit its power) so the undirected energy of Chokmah wouldradiate into space and be lost if there were nothing to receive its impulse andutilise it. Chokmah explodes like petrol; Binah is the combustion-chamber;Gedulab and Geburah are the back and forth strokes of the piston.Mystical Qabala Page 10227. Now the expansive force given off by petrol is pure energy, but it will notdrive a car.The constrictive organisation of Binah is potentially capable of driving a car,but it cannot do so unless set in motion by the expansion of the stored-upenergy of petrol-vapour. Binah is all-potential, but inert. Chokmah is pureenergy, limitless and tireless, but incapable of doing anything except radiateoff into space if left to its own devices.But when Chokmah acts upon Binah, its energy is gathered up and set to work.When Binah receives the impulse of Chokmah, all her latent capacities areenergised. Briefly, Chokmah supplies the energy, and Binah supplies the machine.III28. Consider now the maleness and femaleness of this Pair of Supernal Oppositesas reflected in the act of generation. The spermatozoa of the male are incapableof more than the briefest life; they are the simplest possible units of energy;once that energy is expended, they dissolve. But the reprod~uctive mechanism ofthe female, the womb that bears and the breasts that feed, are capable ofbringing this handed-on life to independent life of its own; and yet all thiselaborate machinery must lie inert till the stimulus of the Chokmah-force setsit in action. The female reproductive unit is all-potential, but inert; the malereproductive unit is all-potent, but incapable of bringing to birth.29. Most people think that because maleness and femaleness as they know them onthe physical plane are fixed principles determined by structure, that the potentand the potential are rigidly bound to their respective mechanisms. Now this isan error. There is a continual alternation of polarity on every plane except thephysical. And indeed, among primitive types of animal life there is even analternation of polarity on the physical plane. Among higher types, andespecially the vertebrates, polarity is fixed by the accident of birth, save inhermaphroditic anomalies, which can't be regarded as other than pathological,and in which only one sex is ever functionally active, whatever the apparentdevelopment of the other aspect may be. It is a knowledge of this continualinterplay of polarity which is one of the most important secrets of theMysteries.[Page 152]It is in no sense homosexuality, which is a perverted and pathologicalexpression of this fact that breaks out as a disorder of sexual feeling when thelaw of alternating polarity is not rightly understood.30. Briefly, although his actual mode of reproduction on the physical plane isdetermined for every individual by the configuration of his body, his spiritualreactions are not so fixed, for the soul is bi-sexual; in other words, in everyrelation of life we are sometimes positive and sometimes negative, accord mg towhether circumstances are stronger than we are, or we are stronger thancircumstances. This is clearly indicated in the proverb, that the grey mare issometimes the better horse. It also comes out clearly in the fact that Netzach(Venus-Aphrodite) is the basal Sephirah of Chokmah's Pillar. We thus get thefemale nature showing a different polarity on different levels, for in Netzachshe is as positive and dynamic as she is static in Binah.Mystical Qabala Page 10331. All this is not only bewildering intellectually, but also confusing morally,and even at the risk of being accused of fostering all manner of abnormalities,I must try to make the matter clear, for its practical implications are sofar-reaching.32. It has been said by the Rabbis that each Sephirah is negative in relation tothe one above it by which it is emanated, and positive in relation to the onebelow it which it emanates. This gives us the key; we are negative in ourrelationships with that which is of a higher potential than we are; and we arepositive in our relationships with that which has a lower potential. This is arelationship which is in a perpetual state of flux, and which varies at everyseparate point at which we make our innumerable contacts with our environment.33. For the most part, the relationship between a man and a woman is notentirely satisfactory to either party, and they have either to put up withincomplete satisfaction in their relationship under the compulsion of religiousor econorflic pressure, or supplement elsewhere their incompleteness, with as arule a recurrence of the previous conditions when once the novelty has worn off.It is to be observed that under such circumstances it is only in novelty thatsexual satisfaction at its highest is to be found; and novelty is a thing whichrequires constantly to be renewed, with disastrous results to sexual economics.34. The trouble is, that while the male gives the physical stimulus which leadsto reproduction, he does not realise that on the inner planes he is by virtue ofthe law of reversed polarity, negative, and is dependent for his emotionalcompleteness upon the stimulation given by the female. He is dependent upon herfor emotional fertilisation, as is clearly shown in the case of any highlycreative mind, such as Wagner or Shelley.35. Marriage is not a matter of two halves, but of four quarters, uniting inbalanced harmony of reciprocal fecundation. Binah and Chokmah are balanced byHod and Netzach. There are goddesses as well as gods for man to worship. Boazand Jakin are both pillars of the Temple, and only when united do they producestability. A goddessless religion is half-way to atheism. In the word Elohim wefind the true key. Elohim is translated \"God\" in both Authorised and RevisedVersions of the Holy Scriptures. It really ought to be translated \"God andGoddess,\" for it is a feminine noun with a masculine plural termination aflixed.This is an incontrovertible fact, in its linguistic aspect at any rate, and itis to be presumed that the various authors of the books of the Bible knew whatthey meant, and did not use this peculiar and unique form without good reason.\"And the spirit of the male and female conjoined principles moved upon thesurface of the formless, and manifestation took place.\" If we want equilibriuminstead of our present condition of unequal stresses, we must worship theElohim, not Jehovah.36. The worship of Jehovah instead of the Elohim is a Potent influence inpreventing us from \"rising on the planes,\" that is to say from obtainingsupernormal consciousness as Part of our normal equipment; for we must beprepared to Shift our Polarity as we shift level, for what is positive on thePhysical Plane becomes negative on the astral, and vice versa.Mystical Qabala Page 104[Page 154]Also, as practical occult work always involves the use of more than one plane,either simultaneously, as in invocation arid evocation, or in succession, aswhen we correlate the levels of consciousness after psychic work, the negativefactor must always have its place in our work, both subjectively andobjectively.37. This again opens up new aspects of the subject, how many people realise thattheir own souls are literally bi-sexual within themselves, and that thedifferent levels of consciousness act as male and female towards each other?38. Freud declared that the sex life determines the type of the whole life.Probably, fundamentally, the life as a whole determines the type of the sexlife; but for practical purposes his manner of putting it is true; for while itis not possible to straighten out a tangled sexual life by operating upon lifeas a whole-for instance, no amount of wealth or fame is any adequatecompensation if this fundamental instinct be thwarted - it is quite possible tostraighten out the whole life-pattern by disentangling the sex life. This is amatter of practical experience, and does not need to be reasoned from a priorigrounds.No doubt it is for this reason, learned by practical experience of the workingsof the human consciousness, that the ancients made phallicism such an importantpart of their rites. Actually, it is a very important factor in the ceremonialaspect of the worship of moderns also, but recognition of the significance ofthe symbols employed traditionally has been repressed from consciousness.39. Freudian psychology supplies the key to phallicism and opens a door thatleads into the Adytum of the Mysteries. There is no getting away from this factin practical occultism, unpalatable as it may be to many; and it explains why somany magical enterprises are sterile.40. These matters are highly recondite secrets of the Mysteries, of which wemoderns have lost the keys; but the experience of the new psychology, and itsallied art of psychiatry, has abundantly proved the soundness of the basis onwhich the ancients built when they made adoration of the creative principle andof fertility an important part of their religious life. It is a matter ofwell-established experience that the person who has dissociated his or hersexual feelings from consciousness can never get to grips with life on anylevel. This fact is the basis of modern psychotherapy. In occult work theinhibited, repressed person tends to unbalanced forms of psychism andmediumship, and is totally useless for rnagical work in which power has to bedirected and handled by the will. This does not mean that either totalrepression or total expression is necessary for magical working, but it doesmost emphatically mean that the person who is cut off from his instincts, whichare his roots in Mother Earth, and in whose consciousness in consequence thereis a gap, cannot be an open channel through which power can be brought down theplanes into manifestation on the physical level.41. I shall no~doubt be abused and misrepresented for my frankness in/thesematters; but if no one will come forward and bear the odium of speaking thetruth, how is the Mystical Qabala Page 105wayfaring man to find his way in the Mysteries? Are we to maintain a Victorianattitude in the lodge which has everywhere been abandoned outside it? Someonemust break these false gods made in the image of Mrs Grundy. I am inclined tothink, however, that any loss I may Sustain on this account will be small, forit would not be possible to train or to co-operate with the kind of person whois thrown into a panic by plain speaking ? Do not let it be thought that I aminviting anyone to participate with me in phallic orgies, as it will probably besaid that I am doing. I am merely pointing out that the person who cannot seethe significance of phallic worship from the psychological point of view has notgot enough brains to be of very much use in the Mysteries.IV42. Having given considerable space to the elucidation of the Binah principlefunctioning in polarity with Chokmah, for not otherwise can it be understood,for it is essentially a principle of polarity, we can now consider thesignificance of the[Page 156]"},{"pageContent":"symbolism assigned to the Third Sephirah. This falls into two divisions - theGreat Mother aspect and the Saturn aspect, for both these attributions are givento Binah. She 15 the mighty Mother of All Living, and she is also the deathprinciple; for the giver of life in form is also the giver of death, for formmust die when its use is outworn. Upon the Planes of form, death and birth arethe two sides of the same coin.43. The mother aspect of Binah finds expression in the title of Marah, the Sea,which is given her. It is a curious fact that Venus-Aphrodite is represented asbeing born of the sea-foam, and the Virgin Mary is called by Catholics StellaMans, Star of the Sea. The word Marab, which is the root of Mary, also meansbitter, and the spiritual experience attributed to Binah is the Vision ofSorrow. A vision which calls to ruind the picture of the Virgin weeping at thefoot of the Cross, her heart pierced by seven swords. We also recall theteaching of the Buddha that life is sorrow. The idea of subjection to sorrow anddeath is implicit in the idea of the descent of life to the planes of form.44. The Yetziratic Text of Malkuth, already referred to, speaks of the Throne ofBinab.One of the titles given to the Third Sephirab is Khorsia, the Throne; and theangels assigned to this Sephirah are called the Aralim, which also meansthrones. Now a throne essentially suggests the idea of a stable basis, a firmfoundation, upon which the wielder of power takes his seat and cannot be moved.It is, in fact, a thrust-block which takes the back-pressure of a force as theshoulder takes the kick of a rifle. The great guns used for long-distanceranging have to be bedded in a mass of concrete in order that they may resistthis back pressure of the charge that drives the shell forwards; for it isobvious that the pressure on the breech of the gun must equal the pressure onthe base of the shell when the gun goes off. This is a truth which ouridealising religious tendencies are inclined to ignore, with a consequentweakening and invalidating of their teaching.Binah, Marah, matter, is the thrust-block which gives dynamic life-force itssecure basis, out of the resistance to spiritual force, as we have alreadynoted, comes the idea of Mystical Qabala Page 106implicit evil, which is so unjust as Binah. This comes out very clearly when weconsider the ideas that rise up in association with Saturn-Chronos. There issomething sinister about Saturn. He is the Greater Malefic of the astrologers,and anyone who finds a square to Saturn in therr horoscope. regards it as aheavy affliction. Saturn is the resister; but, being a resister, he is also astabiliser and tester who does not allow us to trust our weight to that whichwill not bear it. It is an illuminating point that the Thirty-second Path, whichleads from Malkuth to Yesod and is the first Path trodden by the soul strivingupwards, is assigned to Saturn. He is the god of the most ancient form ofmatter. The Greek myth of Chronos, which is simply the Greek name for the sameprinciple, looks upon him as one of the Old Gods; that is to say, the Gods thatmade the Gods. He was the father of Jupiter-Zeus, who was saved from him by acunning device of his mother, for Saturn had an unpleasant habit of eating hischiIdren. In this myth we get again the idea of the bringer into life as thegiver of death. As we have already noted, Saturn with his reaping-hook readilybecomes Death with his scythe. It is very interesting to note the re-entrantcurves of these chains of associated ideas in connection with each Sephirah, forwe cannot but see how the same images crop up again and again in every train ofideas that we pursue, even when we start from ideas as apparently divergent asthe mother, the sea, and time.46. To each planet is assigned a virtue and a vice; in other words, each planetmay be, in the words of the astrologers, well or badly aspected, well or illdignified. We cannot go through life without noting that every type of characterhas the vices of its virtues; that is to say, its virtues, carried to extremes,becomes vices. So it is with the seven planetary Sephiroth; they have their goodand bad aspects according to the proportions in which they are represented; whenthere is lack of equilibrium owing to the unbalanced force of a particularSephirah, we experience the evil influences of that[Page 158]Sephirah; for instance, Saturn ate his children! Death began to destroy lifebefore it had fulfilled its function. No Sephirah, therefore, is wholly andsolely evil, not even Geburah- which is destruction personified. They are all equally indispensable to thescheme of things as a whole, and their relative good or evil influence dependson their being where they are wanted, in the right proportions, neither too muchnor too little. Too little of the influence of a given Sephirah leads tounbalance on the part of its opposite number. Too much becomes a positively evilinfluence a Poisonous overdose.47. The virtue of Binah is said to be Silence, and its vice Avarice. Here againwe see the Saturn influence making itself felt. Keats speaks of \"grey-hairedSaturn, silent as a stone,\" and in these few words the poet conjures up amagical image of the primordial age and silence of the Saturnian influence.Saturn is indeed one of the Old Gods and is concerned with the mineral aspect ofearth. He is throned upon the most ancient rocks where no plant grows.48. It is this silence which has ever been held to be an especially desirablevirtue in women. Be that as it may, and no doubt her tongue is her mostdangerous weapon, Mystical Qabala Page 107silence indicates receptivity. If we are silent, we can listen, and so learn;but if we are talking, the gates of entrance to the mind are closed. It is theresistance and receptivity of Binah which are her chief powers. And out of thesevirtues comes the vice which is constituted by their overplus, the avarice whichdenies too much and would withhold even that which is needful. When thisprevails, we need the generous Gedulah-Geburah, Jupiter-Mars influence to slaythe old god, the slayer of his children, and reign in his stead.49. The magical symbols of Binah are said to be the yoni and the Outer Robe ofConcealment, the latter is a gnostic term and the former an Indian one, meaningthe genitals of the female, the negative correspondence of the phallus of themale. The less well-known term Kteis is the European equivalent. In Hindureligious symbols the yoni and lingam appear with the greatest frequency, forthe idea of life-force and fertility is a prime mover in their faith.50. The idea of fertility is the main motif in the aspects of Binah thatmanifest in the world of Assiah, the material level. Life not only enters intomatter for discipline, but it also issues thence triumphantly, increased andmultiplied. The fertility aspect, balancing the Time-Death-Limitation aspect, isessential to our concept of Binab. Time-Death puts his sickle to the wheat ofCeres, and both are Binah symbols.51. The idea of the Outer Robe of Concealment clearly suggests matter; and theshrouding herein of the Inner Robe of Glory of the life-principle. How clearlydo these two ideas, taken together, convey to us the concept of the bodyensouled by the spirit; its Inner Robe of Spiritual Glory concealed from alleyes by the outer covering of dense matter. Again and again, as we meditate uponthese mysteries, do we find illumination from the apparently fortuitouscollection of symbols assigned to each Sephirah. We have seen already in ourstudy that no symbol stands alone, and that any penetration on the part of theintuition and the imagination serves to reveal long lines of interlacingconnections between them.52. The four Threes of the Tarot pack are the cards assigned to Binah, andindeed the number three is intimately associated with the idea of manifestationin matter. The two opposing forces find expression in a third, the equilibnumbetween them, which manifests on a lowe plane than its parents. The triangle isone of the symbols assigned to Saturn as the god of densest matter, and thetriangle of art, as it is called, is used in magical ceremonies and it is theintention to evoke a to visible appearance on the plane of matter; for othermodes of manifestation the circle is used.53. The Three of Wands is called the Lord of Established Strength. Here again wehave the idea of power in equilibrium, which is so characteristic of Binah.Wands, be it remembered, represent the dynamic Yod force. This force, when inthe sphere of Binah, ceases to be dynamic and becomes consolidated.[Page 160]Mystical Qabala Page 10854 Cups are essentially the female force, for the cup or chalice is one of thesymbols of Binah and is intimately allied with the yoni in esoteric symbolism.The three of Cups is, therefore, at home in Binah, for the two sets of symbolsreinforce each other. The three of Cups, which is aptly named Abundance,represents the fertility of Binah in her Ceres aspect.55. The Three of Swords, however, is called Sorrow, and its symbol in the Tarotpack is a heart pierced by three swords. Out readers will recall the referenceto the sword-pierced heart of the Virgin Mary in Catholic symbolism, and Maryequates with Marab, bitter, the Sea. Ave, Maria, stella maris!56. Swords are, of course, Geburah cards, and as such represent the destructiveaspect of Binah as Kali, the wife of Siva, the Hindu goddess of destruction.57. Pentacles are cards of Earth, and as such are congemal to Binah, form. Thethree of Pentacles, therefore, is Lord of Material Works, or activity on theplane of form.58. It will be observed that, just as the planets have their influencereinforced when they are in those signs of the Zodiac which are called their ownhouses, so the Tarot cards, when the significance of the Sephirah coincides withthe spirit of the Suit, represent the active aspect of the influence; and whenthe Sephirah and the suit represent different influences, the card is malefic.For instance, the fiery Sword card is a card of evil omen when it finds itselfin the sphere of influence of Binab.59. And finally to sum up. I have written of Binab at this length because withher is completed the Supernal Triad and the first of the Pairs of Opposites. Sherepresents not only herself but also the functioning partners, for it isimpossible to understand any unit on the Tree save by reference to those otherunits with which it interacts and equilibrates.Chokmah without Binab, and Binab without Chokmah, are incomprehensible, for thepair are the functional unit, and not either of them separately.CHAPTER XVIIICHESED, THE FOURTH SEPHIRAHTITLE: Chesed, Mercy.

Between the Three Supernals and the next pair of balancing Sephiroth upon theTree there is a great gulf fixed[Page 162]which is called by mystics the Abyss. The next six Sephiroth, Chesed, Geburah,Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod, constitute what Qabalists callMicroprosopos, the Mystical Qabala Page 110Lesser Countenance, Adam Kadmon, the King. The Queen, the Bride of the King, isMalkuth, the Physical Plane. We have, then, the Father (Kether), the King, andthe Bride, and in this con figuration of the Tree there is profound symbolismand great practical importance in both philosophy and magic.2. The Abyss, the gulf fixed between Macroprosopos and Microprosopos, marks ademarcation in the nature of being, in the type of existence prevailing upon thetwo levels. It is in the Abyss that Daath, the Invisible Sephirah, has itsstation, and it might aptly be named the Sephirah of Becoming. It is also calledUnderstanding, which might be further interpreted as Perception, Apprehension,Consciousness.3. These two types of existence, Macroprosopos and Microprosopos, serve toindicate the potential and the actual. Actual manifestation, as our finite mindscan conceive it, begins with Microprosopos; and the first aspect ofMicroprosopos to come into being is Chesed, the Fourth Sephirah, situatedimmediately below Chokmah, the Father, in the Pillar of Mercy, of which it isthe central Sephirah. It is balanced across the Tree by Geburah, Severity; andthis pair, Geburab and Gedulab, form \"the Power and the Glory\" of the finalinvocation of the Lord's Prayer; the \"Kingdom\" being, of course, Malkuth.4. As we have already seen, we can learn much from the position of a Sephirah inthe pattern of the Tree; and from the position of Chesed on the Pillar of Mercywe see tha~ it is Chokmah upon a lower arc. It is emanated by Binab, a passiveSephirah, and emanates Geburah, a katabolic Sephirah, whose Mundane Chakra isMars with all his warlike symbolism, who is Saturn upon a lower arc.5. From these things we can learn a great deal about Chesed. It is the lovingfather, the protector and preserver, just as Chokmah is the All-begetter. Itcontinues the work of Chokmah, organising and preserving that which theAll-Father has begotten. It balances with mercy the severity of Geburah. It isanabolic, or uphuilding, in contra-distinction to the katabolism, ordown-breaking of Geburah.6. These two aspects are very well expressed in the Magical Images assigned tothese two Sephiroth. These Magical Images are both kings; that of Chesed a kingon his throne, and that of Geburah a king in his chariot; in other words, therulers of the kingdom in peace and in war; the one a lawgiver and the other awarrior.7. The analogy of physiology gives us a clear understanding of the significanceof these two Sephiroth. Metabolism consists of anabolism, or the ingesting andassimilating of food and its building up into tissue, and katabolism, or thebreaking down of tissue in active work and the output of energy. The by-productsof katabolism are the fatigue-poisons which have to be eliminated from the bloodby rest. The life-process is an everlasting uphuilding and downbreaking, andGeburah and Gedulah (another name for Chesed) represent these two processes inthe Macrocosm.8. Chesed, being the first Sephirah of Microprosopos, or the manifesteduniverse, represents the formulation of the archetypal idea, the~ concretion ofthe abstract. When Mystical Qabala Page 111the abstract principle that Qms the root of some new activity is formulating inour minds, we are operating in the sphere of Chesed. Let an example serve tomake this clear.Supposing an explorer is looking out from a mountain over a newly discoveredcountry and sees that the inland plains lying behind the coastal ranges arefertile, and that a river flows through these plains and makes its ~ay to thesea through a gap in the mountain chain. He thinks of the agricultural wealth ofthe plains, transport down the river, and a harbour on the estuary,he knows thatthe scour of the river will have made a tunnel by which ships can come in. Inhis mind's eye he sees the wharfs and the warehouses, the stores and thedwellings. He wonders whether the mountains contain minerals, and pictures arailway line alongside the river and branch lines up the valleys. He sees thecolonists coming in, and the need[Page 164]for a church, a hospital, a gaol, and the ubiquitous saloon. His imaginationmaps out the main street of the township, and he determines to stake corner lotsthat he may prosper with the prosperity of the new settlement. All this he seeswhile virgin forest covers the coastal belt and blocks the mountain passes. Butbecause he knows that the plains are fertile and that the river has come throughthe mountains, he sees in terms of first principles all the development thatfollows. While his mind is working thus, he is functioning in the sphere ofChesed whether he knows it or not; and all those who can also function in termsof Chesed and think ahead as he does, seeing the thing that must arise fromgiven causes long before the first line is drawn on the plan or the first bricklaid in the trench, are able to possess themselves of the valuable land wherethe wharfs must be built and the main street must run.9. All the creative work of the world is done thus, by minds working in terms ofChesed the King seated upon his throne, holding sceptre and orb, ruling andguiding his people.10. By contrast with this we observe the people whose minds cannot functionabove the level of Malkuth, the Bride of the King. They are the folk who cannotsee the wood for trees. They think in terms of detail, lacking any syntheticprinciple. Their logic is never able to reach back to origins but is alwaysmaterialistic. They are never able to discern subtle causes, and are the victimsof what they call the caprices of chance. They are unable to discern subtleconditions, nor can they work out the line that primary impulses will follow, orcan be made to follow, when these are coming down, or being brought down, intomanifestation.11. The occultist who does not possess the initiation of Chesed will be limitedin his function to the sphere of Yesod, the plane of Maya, illusion. For him theastral images reflected in the magic mirror of subconsciousness will beactualities ; he will make no attempt to translate them into terms of a higherplane and learn what they really represent.He will have made himself a dwelling in the sphere of illusion, and he will bedeluded by the phantasms of his own unconscious projection. If he were able tofunction in terms of Chesed, he would perceive the underlying archetypal ideasof which these magical images are but the shadows and symbolic representations.He then becomes a master in Mystical Qabala Page 112the treasure-house of images instead of being hallucinated by them. He can usethe images as a mathematician uses algebraic symbols. He works magic as aninitiated adept and not as a magician.12. The mystic functioning in the Christ-centre of Tiphareth, if he lacks thekeys of Chesed, will also be hallucinated, but in a different and more subtleway. Upon this level he will read the magical images truly enough, referringthem to that which they represent and giving them no values save as tokens, asSt Theresa has so clearly shown in her Interior Castle. He will fall into theerror, however, of thinking that the images he perceives and the experiences heundergoes are the direct and personal dealings of God with his soul, instead ofrealising that they are stages on the Path. He will find a personal Saviour inthe God-man instead of in the regenerative influence of the Christ-force. Hewill worship Jesus of Nazareth as God the Father, thus confounding the Persons.13. Chesed, then, is the sphere of the formulation of the archetypal idea; theapprehension by consciousness of an abstract concept which is subsequentlybrought down the planes and concreted in the light of experience of theconcretion of analogous abstract ideas.Equally, in its macrocosmic aspect, it reprents a corresponding phase in theprocess of creation. Materialistic science believes that the only abstractconcepts are those formulated by the mind of man. Esoteric science teaches thatthe Divine Mind formulated archetypal ideas in order that substance might takeform, and that without such Archetypal ideas substance was formless and void,primordial slime awaiting the breath of life to organise into the crystal andcell. The latest researches in physics have revealed that every substance,without exception,has a crystalline structure, and the lines of tension that thepsychic perceives as etheric stresses have been revealed by the X-rays.[Page 166]14. A very important and very imperfectly understood part in the Mysteries isplayed by those beings who are generally called the Masters. Different schoolsdefine the term differently, and some include living adepts of a high gradeamong the Masters; but we consider that it is advisable to make a distinctionbetween the incarnate and disincarnate Elder Brethren because their mission andmode of function are entirely different. The title of Master should therefore begiven only to those who are free from the wheel of birth and death. In theterminology of the Western Esoteric Tradition the grade of Adeptus Exemptus isassigned to Chesed, the term Exemptus, or exempt, indicating that freedom fromkarma which liberates from the Wheel. I am fully aware that others may attach adifferent significance to the title, and that there are persons in incarnationwho hold this grade. To these I reply that such persons, if the grade be afunctioning one and not a mere empty honour, are karma-free and will notreincarnate. Such persons might justly be termed Masters, for theirconsciousness is of the grade of a Master, but as it is so necessary to make thedistinction between incarnate and disincarnate adepts, it is better to qualifythe classification by this minor distinction than to allow to humans a prestigewhich human nature is not fitted to bear. As long as an adept is incarnated hewill be liable to human frailties in some degree, and to the limitations imposedby old age and physical health. It is not until he is free from the Wheel, andfunctions as pure Mystical Qabala Page 113consciousness, that he will escape from human bondage to heredity andenvironment; therefore the same reliance cannot be placed in him that can beplaced in the true, disincarnate Masters.15. A very important part of the work of the Masters is the concretion of theabstract ideas conceived by the Logoidal consciousness. The Logos, Whosemeditation gives birth to worlds and Whose unfolding consciousness is evolution,conceives archetypal ideas out of the substance of the Unmanifest - to use ametaphor where definition is impossible.These ideas remain within the Cosmic consciousness of the Logos like the seedwithin the flower, because there is no soil therein for their germination. TheLogoidal consciousness, as pure being, cannot upon Its own plane provide theformative aspect necessary for manifestation. It is taught in the esoterictraditions that the Masters, disincarnate consciousnesses disciplined by formbut now formless, in their meditations upon the Godhead are able to perceivetelepathically these archetypal ideas in the mind of God, and by realising thepractical application of them to the planes of form and the line thisdevelopment will follow, produce concrete images in their own consciousnesswhich serve to bring the abstract archetypal ideas down to the first of theplanes of form, called by the Qabalists, Briah.16. This, then, is the work that the Masters perform in their special sphere,the sphere of the organising, upbuilding, constructive Chesed on the Pillar ofMercy. The work of the Dark Masters, who are quite different from the BlackAdepts, is performed in the corresponding sphere of Geburah, on the Pillar ofSeverity, which will be considered in due course. The point of contact betweenthe Masters and their human disciples is in Hod, the Sephirah of ceremonialmagic, as is indicated by the Yetziratic Text, which declares that from Gedulah,the Fourth Sephirah emanates the essence of Hod. These hints given in theYetziratic Texts concerning the relations between the individual Sephiroth arevery important in practical occultism. Ho then, may be taken as representingChokmah and Chesed upon a lower arc, even as Netzach represents Binah andGeburah. This will be explained in detail when these Sephiroth are dealt with,but it must be referred to briefly now in order to make the function of Chesedintelligible.17. We have now reached a point in the scheme of the Tree where the type ofactivity comes within the range of human consciousness. In the study of thepreceding Sephiroth we were formulating metaphysical concepts. These concepts,although {???rei~dte} from immediate application to the life of form, areexceedingly important, for unless they are at the[Page 168]basis of our understanding of esoteric science we shall fall into superstitionand use magic as magicians, not as adepts; in other words, we shall be unable totranscend the bondage of the planes of form and will be hallucinated and fallunder the domination of the phantoms evoked by the magical imagina tion, insteadof using them as the beads on the abacus of our calculations, which is as if theengineer used the slide-rule as if it were a foot-rule.Mystical Qabala Page 11418. Chesed, then, reflects into Hod through the Christcentre of Tiphareth, justas Geburah reflects into Netzach. This teaches us a great deal, for it indicatesthat for conscious~ ness to rise from form to force, and for force to descend toform, it must pass through the Centre of Equilibrium and Redemption, to whichare assigned the Mysteries of the Crucifixion.19. It is to the Sphere of Chesed that the exalted consciousness of the adeptrises in his occult meditations; it is here that he receives the inspirationswhich he works uut on the planes of form. It is here that he meets the Mastersas spiritual influences contacted telepathically, without any intermingling ofpersonality. This is the true, and the highest, mode of contact with theMasters, contact with them as mind to mind in their own sphere of exaltedconsciousness. When the Masters are seen clairvoyantly as robed beings, thecolours of whose robes indicate their ray, they are being perceived reflectedinto the sphere of Yesod, which is the kingdom of phantasms and hallucinations.We are treading on precarious ground when we have to meet the Masters here. Itis here that the anthropomorphic form is given to the spiritual inspirationwhich so misleads those psychics who cannot rise to Chesed. It is thus that theannouncement of a spiritual impulse flowing out upon the world gets interpretedas the coming of a World Teacher.II20. As we come down the Tree into those spheres more within the range of ourcomprehension than theThree Supernals, we find the symbols associated with eachSephirah becoming more and more eloquent as they speak to our experience insteadof causing us to reason by analogy.21. The magical image representing Chesed is a mighty throned and crowned king;throned because he is seated in stability in a kingdom at peace, not going forthin his chariot to war, as is suggested by the magical image of Geburah. Theadditional titles of Chesed-Majesty, Love-bear out this concept of the benignantking, the father of his people; and the situation of Chesed in the centre of thePillar of Mercy further bears out the idea of stability and ordered and mercifullaw, governing for the good of the governed. The title of the angelic hostassociated with Chesed-the Chasmalim, or Brilliant Ones~nhances the idea of theroyal splendour of Gedulah, which is an alternative title frequently used forChesed. The Mundane Chakra assigned to Chesed-Jupiter, the great benignity ofastrology-confirms the whole chain of associations.22. Upon the microcosmic, or subjective, side we find that the virtue assignedto this sphere of experience is that of obedience. It is only through the virtueof obedience that the sublect can profit by the wise rule of Chesed. We have tosacrifice much of our independence and egoism in order to share in the amenitiesof organised social life. From this sacrifice and restriction there is noescape. In this sphere no more than in any other is impossible to eat one's cakeand haveit. There is no such thing as liberty if liberty is to be interpreted asunrestricted self-will.The force of gravity resists us, if nothing else. Liberty might be defined asthe right to Mystical Qabala Page 115choose one's master, for a ruler one must have in all organised corporate life,else there is chaos. It is effectual and inspiring leadership that is the cryingneed of the world at the present time, and country after country is seeking andfinding the ruler who approximates most closely to its national ideal, and isfalling {???4nasĽn~} man behind him. It is the benign, organised in the orderingJupiter influence that is the only medicine for[Page 170]the world's sickness; as this comes to bear, the nations will recover theiremotional poise and physical health.23. Conversely, the vices assigned to Chesed - bigotry, hypocrisy, gluttony, andtyranny -are all social vices. Bigotry refuses to move with the times or see anotherpoint of View, both fatal vices in racial relationships. Hypocrisy implies thatwe do not give ourselves whole-heartedly to the corporate life, but, likeAnanias, keep back a part of the price.Gluttony exposes us to the temptation of taking more than our fair share of thecommon store, and is but another name for selfishness. And tyranny is that wronguse of authority which arises where there are taints of cruelty and vanity inthe nature.24. The correspondence in the microcosm is given as the left arm, whichindicates a less dynamic mode of the functioning of power than that of the righthand which grasps~the sword in the magical image of Geburah. The left hand holdsthe orb, which signifies the earth itself, and shows that all is held secure inthe firm grasp of the ruler. Chesed, in fact, denotes firmness rather thandynamic strength and energy.25. The mystical number of Chesed is said to be four, and this is oftenrepresented as a four-sided figure, or tetrahedron. A talisman of Jupiter isalways set up on such a figure.Another symbol of Chesed is the solid figure as understood in geometry. Thereason for this is easily seen if one considers the geometrical figures assignedto the Sephiroth which have already been studied. The point is assigned toKether; the line to Chokmah; the two-dimensional plane to Binah; consequentlythe three-dimensional solid naturally falls to Chesed.26. But more is signified in this connection than a mere random series ofsymbols. The solid essentially represents manifestation as it is known to ourthree-dimensional consciousness. We cannot conceive of one- or two-dimensionalexistence save mathematically or symbolically. Chesed, as we have already noted,is the first of the manifested Sephiroth; therefore how naturally does thesymbol of the solid figure come into line with the rest of its symbolism. Thesolid figure used for the purpose of symbolising Chesed is usually the pyramid,which is a four-sided figure, consisting of three faces and a base, thusexpressing the numerological quality of Chesed.27. There are many different aspects of the cross as a significant Mysterysymbol, besides the Calvary Cross of the Christian Mystery, and each of thesecrosses represents different modes of the functioning of spiritual power, justas do the different forms of the Holy Names of God. The form of cross associatedwith Chesed is the equal-armed cross, which Mystical Qabala Page 116is symbolic of the four elements in equilibrium, and implies the ruling ofnature by a synthesising influence which brings all things into balancedharmony.28. The orb, wand, sceptre, and crook, all assigned to this Sephirah, express soperfectly the different aspects of the benign royal power of Chesed that theyare in no need of elucidation.29. The four Tarot cards that are placed on Chesed when is set up for adivination carry out the ruling idea in the correispondence. The Four of Wandssymbolises Perfected Work, thus representing admirably the achievement of theking in peace-dome in his well-governed kingdom. The Four of Cups is called theLord of Pleasure, and is in keeping with the title of Splendour assigned toChesed and with the brilliancy of its angelic host. The Four of Swords indicatesRest from Strife, and agrees perfectly with the significance of the seatedruler. The Four of Pentacles is the Lord of Earthly Power, a symbolism spobvious that it needs no elucidation.30. The consideration of the Yetziratic Text has been left to the last in thisstudy, in order that the sequence of the symbolism, unfolding in such orderedrelationship, might not be broken in upbn. Moreover, this text contains so muchsignificance that it is best studied when we are as fully equipped as possiblewith the cognate symbolism. Much that relates to the thing contained in thistext, however, has already been studied as it came up for examination inrelation to the[Page 172]preceding Sephiroth. I will not repeat this at length, but content myself withreferring the student to those pages where the matters are dealt with in detail,thus avoiding needless repetition which otherwise is bound to occur in the studyof such a subject as the Tree of Life, where different symbols represent thesame potency upon different levels of manifestation or under different aspects.31. \"The Fourth Path is called the Cohesive Intelligence.\" How clearly can wesee the meaning of these words when we have learnt to look upon Chesed throughthe symbol of the king seated upon his throne, organising the resources andprosperity of his kingdom, and causing all things to be drawn together into anordered whole for the common good.32. It is also called the Receptive Intelligence in the Yetziratic Text, andthis is borne out in the symbol of the left arm, which is assigned to thisSephirah in the microcosm.33. Chesed \"Contains all the Holy Powers, and from it emanate all the spiritualvirtues with the most exalted Essences.\" The teaching implicit in this statementhas already been elucidated in the previous exegesis under the concept ofarchetypal ideas.34. \"They emanate one from another by virtue of the primordial emanation, theHighest Crown, Kether.\" These concepts have already been dealt with in relationto the Second Mystical Qabala Page 117Sephirah, Chokmah, when the overflowing of force from Sphere to Sphere wasconsidered.CHAPTER XIXGEBURAH, THE FIFTH SEPHIRAHTITLE: Geburah, Strength, Severity.

One of the least understood things in Christian philosophy is the problem ofevil; and one of the things least[Page 174]adequately dealt with in the Christian ethic is the problero of force, orseverity, as contrasted with mercy and rnildness Consequently Geburah, the FifthSephirah, which has for additional titles Din (Justice) and Pachad (Fear), isone of the least understood of all the Sephiroth, and is therefore one of themost important. Were it not that the Qabalistic doctrine explicitly lays it downthat all the Ten Sephiroth are holy, there are many who would be inclined tolook Upon Geburah as the evil aspect of the Tree of Life.Indeed, the planet Mars, whose sphere is the Mundane Chakra of Geburah, iscalled in astrology an infortune.2. Those, however, who are instructed beyond the crude pretty-pretty of awish-fulfilling philosophy know that Geburah is by no means the Enemy orAdversary described in Scripture, but the king in his chariot going forth to warwhose strong right arm protects his people with the sword of righteousness andensures that justice shall be done. Chesed, the king on his throne, the fatherof his people in times of peace, may win our love; but it is Geburah, the kingin his chariot going forth to war, who commands our respect.Sufficient justice has not been done to the part played by the sentiment ofrespect in the emotion of love. We have a kind of love for the person who canput the fear of God into us, should occasion arise, which is of quite adifferent quality, is far more steadfast and permanent, and, curiously enough,far more emotionally satisfying, than the love with which no tinge of awe ismingled. It is Geburah that supplies the element of awe, of the fear of the Lordwhich is the beginning of wisdom, and of a general wholesome respect which helpsus to keep to the straight and narrow way and calls forth our better nature,because we know our sihs will find us out.3. This is a factor to which the Christian ethic, as popularly understood, doesnot give sufficient weight; and because the general tone of Christian society isbiassed against the holy Fifth Sephirah, it will be necessary to consider itsplace jo relation to the Tree and the part it plays in both spiritual and sociallife in considerable detail; for it is ill-Mystical Qabala Page 119understood, and this absence of understanding of the Geburah-factor is the causeof many of our difficulties in modern life.4. Geburah holds the central position on the Pillar of Severity; it thereforerepresents the katabolic, or down-breaking aspect of force. Katabolism, be itremembered, is that aspect of metabolism, or the life-process, which is combinedwith the release of force in activity.It has been said that good is that which is constructive, which builds up, andevil is that which is destructive, which breaks down. How false thisphilosophyis we see when we tryto classify, according w this principle, a cancerand a disinfectant. In the deeper, more philosophical teaching of the Mysterieswe recognise that good and evil are not things in themselves, but conditions.Evil is simply misplaced force; misplaced in time, if it is out of date, or sofar ahead of its day as to be impracticable. Misplaced in space, if it turns upin the wrong place, like the burning coal on the hearth-rug or the bath~terthrough the drawing-room ceiling. Misplaced in proportion, if an excess of lovemakes us silly and sentimental, or a lack of love makes us cruel anddestructive. It is in such things as these that evil lies, not in a personalDevil who acts as Adversary.5. Geburah the Destroyer, the Lord of Fear and Severity, is therefore asnecessary to the equilibrium of the Tree as chesed, the Lord of Love, andNetzach, the Lady of Beauty.Gebura his the Celestial Surgeon; he is the knight in shining arinour, thedragon-slayer; beautiful as a bridegroom in his strength to the maiden indistress, though, no doubt, the dragon might have preferred a little more love.6. The initiations of the infortunes, Saturn, Mars, and the deceptive lunarYesod, are just as necessary to the evolution and balanced development of thesoul as are the Mysteries of the Crucifixion assigned to Tiphareth. It is theone-sidedness of Christianity which is its bane, and is responsible for so muchthat is unsound and pathological in both our national and our private lives.But, equally, we must not forget that Christianity as a corrective to a paganworld that was sick unto death[Page 176]with its own toxins. We need what Christianity has to give but also,unfortunately, we cannot do without that which it lacks. Let us now consider theastringent, corrective influence of Geburah.7. Dynamic energy is as necessary to the welfare of society as meekness,charity, and patience. We must never forget that the eliminatory diet, whichwill restore health in disease, will produce disease in health. We must neverexalt the qualities which are necessary to compensate an overplus of force intoends in themselves and the means of salvation. Too much charity is the handiworkof a fool; too much patience is the hall-mark of a coward. What we need is ajust and wise balance which makes for health, happiness, and sanity all round,and the frank tealisation that sacrifices are necessary to obtain it. You cannoteat your cake and have it in the spiritual sphere any better than anywhere else.Mystical Qabala Page 1208. Geburah is the sacrificial priest of the Mysteries. Now sacrifice does notmean giving up something that is dear to you because a jealous God will brook norival interests in His devotees and is flattered by your pain. It means thedeliberate and open-eyed choice of a greater good in preference to a lessergood, and the athlete prefers the fatigue of exercise to the ease of the sloththat puts him out of condition. Coal burned in a furnace is sacrificed to thegod of steam-power. Sacrifice is really the transmutation of force; the latentenergy in the coal offeted up on the sacrificial altar of the furnace istransmuted into the dynamic energy of steam by means of the appropriatemachinery.9. There is both psychological and cosmic machinery available in connection withevery act of sacrifice which converts it into spiritual energy; artd thisspiritual energy can be applied to other mechanisms and re-appear on the planesof form as an entirely different type of force to that as which it started.10. For instance, a man may sacrifice his emotions to his career; or a woman maysacrifice her career to her emotions. If the cut is clean, and there is norepining, an immense amount of psychic energy is released for use in the chosenchannel. But if the lesser desire is merely inhibited and denied expression andnot really laid upon the altar of sacrifice as a deliberate free-will offenog,the unfortunate victim has made the worst of both worlds. It is here that weneed Geburah to come like the priest that takes the sacrifice from our hands,even if it be our first-born, and offers it up to God with the quick, clean,merciful stroke. For Geburah in the microcosm, which is the soul of man, is thecourage and resolution that frees us from the taint of self-pity.11. How badly do we need the Spartan virtues of Geburah in this age ofsentimentality and the neuroses. How many break-downs would be saved if thisCelestial Surgeon were permitted to make the clean cut that has a chance toheal, and so avoid the deadly compromise and irresolution that is like an openwound and so often goes septic.12. And again, if there were no strong hand at the service of good in the world,evil would multiply. Though it is not well to quench smoking flax when the flaxis making an effort, it is equally evil to put up with the smouldering when whatit really wants is the use of the poker. There is a place where patience becomesweakness and wastes the time of better men, and when mercy becomes folly andexposes the innocent to danger. The policy of non-resistance to evil can only bepursued satisfactorily in a well-policed society; it has never been tried withsuccess under frontier conditions. For Nature, red in tooth and claw, wears thecolour of Geburah; whereas the compensatory civilisation is of Chesed, Mercy,which modifies the unrestricted force and mutual destructiveness of all that isin the Geburah phase of its development. But, equally, we must remember thatcivilisation rests upon Nature as a building rests upon its foundations, whereinis concealed the sanitation so necessary to health.13. Whenever there is anything that has outlived its usefulness, Geburah mustwield the pruning-knife; wherever there is selfishness, it must find itselfimpaled on the spear-point of Geburah; wherever there is violence against theMystical Qabala Page 121[Page 178]weak, or the merciless use of strength, it is the sword of Geburah, not the orbof Chesed, that is the most effectual counteractant; wherever there is sloth anddishonesty, Geburah's sacred scourge is needed; and where there is a removal ofthe landmarks set for our neighbour's protection, it is the chain of Gebu'rahthat must restrain.14. These things are as necessary to the health of society and of the individualas brotherly love, and a good deal rarer, used medicinally and not vengefully,in our sentimental age. Someone has got to cry \"Halt\" to the aggressor, and\"Move on\" to those who are blocking the way, and that someone is functioning asa priest in the sphere of the holy Fifth Sephirah.II15. If we watch life we shall see that rhythm, not stability, is its vitalprinciple. Such stability as manifesting existence achieves is the stability ofa man on a bicycle, balanced between two opposing pulls; he can fall over to theright, or he can fall over to the left, and he keeps his balance by means of hismomentum.16. In the life of individuals, in the development of any transaction, in thetone of any disciplined or highly organised group-mind, we see the constantalternation of the Geburah and Gedulah influences in a rhythmic swing from oneside to the other. Anyone who is responsible for the disciplining of anorganised group knows the constant need for tightening and slackening the reins;for stimulating and steadying. There is a sense of the need to pay out line asthe group surges forward with an impulse of interest and keenness, followed bythe need to take up the slack as the impulse spends itself. If the slack is nottaken up with a firm hand, the group tangles itself in the loops and waxesinsubordinate.The wise handler of humans knows when the reaction has spent itself, and themoment has come to crack the whip of Geburah over the team and make it jump intothe collar again as the new dynamic impulse surges up; but he also knows that hemust not crack it too soon, while the team is having a breather, or one of theless stable units will get a leg over the traces.17. Especially do we see the alternating rhythms of Geburah and Gedulab innational life.I venture to prophesy that the nation is passing out of a Gedulah phase andentering a Geburah one. Everywhere we see a mercy, that has been overstrained bythe imperfections of human nature, being abrogated in favour of a severity whichshall restore the balance of even-handed justice and prevent evil frommultiplying. Police work is being reorganised; judges are giving stiffersentences; penal reform has had a set-back; the humanitarian no longer has thelast word. The group-soul of the race is entering upon a Geburah phase, and haslost patience with its sub-standard units.Mystical Qabala Page 12218. For the next cycle the tendency will be to push the unfit into the discardand concentrate on bringing the fit to their finest development. Geburah will bethe senior partner, and any mitigations of severity that Gedulah proposes willhave to pass the scrutiny of even-handed justice. This is a very necessaryreform, for towards the end of a phase extremes tend to develop, and thehumanitarianism of Gedulah has been abused and made ridiculous, and itsrefinement has become finicking and lost touch with actualities.19. When a new phase comes in on a group-mind scale, it is upon the leastenlightened, the most crowd-minded that its influence is strongest; the culturedalways tend to stand aside from extremes. We see this clearly indicated in theline taken by the various types of journalism. Popular journalism is crying Outfor the free use of the cat as a punishment for crime; for the repudiation ofdebts and international agreements; for, in fact, a general slashing around withthe sword of Geburah. There is on every hand a growing tendency to stand nonon-Sense from anybody; a tendency which makes negotiations exceedinglydifficult to carry on, for Geburah is at his worst as a negotiator, his onecontribution to the discussion being that of the Greek soldier who took hissword and cut the knot.20. Now the initiate, knowing that phase succeeds phase in[Page 180]rhythmic alternation, does not take any phase too seriously, nor think that itis either the end of the world or the millenium.He knows that it will run its course being at first a valuable and necessarycorrective, and in the end running to extremes; but provided there is sufficientvision among the illurninati of a race, the people will not perish, for the veryfact of extremes being arrived at indicates the end of the swing, and thependulum will normally reverse its motion and start coming back towards thecentre of stability. It is only when vision is completely lost to a people thatthe pendulum is allowed to fly off its hook into self-destruction. Rome did it;Carthage did it; more recently Russia has done it. But even when socialorganisation breaks down and the pendulum has gone off into space, the principleof rhythm is inherent in all manifesting existence, and re-establishes itself assoon as any sort of organisation begins to arise out of the wreckage.21. The great weakness of Christianity lies in the fact that it ignores rhythm.It balances God with Devil instead of Vishnu with Siva. Its dualisms areantagonistic instead of equilibrating, and therefore can never issue in thefunctional third in which power is in equilibrium. Its God is the sameyesterday, to-day, and for ever, and does not evolve with an evolving creation,but indulges in one special creative act and rests on His laurels. The whole ofhuman experience, the whole of human knowledge, is against the likelihood ofsuch a concept being true.22. The Christian concept being static, not dynamic, it does not see thatbecause a thing is good, its opposite is not necessarily evil. It has no senseof proportion because it has no realisation of the principle of equilibrium inspace and rhythm in time. Consequently, for Mystical Qabala Page 123the Christian ideal the part is all too often greater than the whole. Meekness,mercy, purity and love are made the ideal of Christian character, and asNietzsche truly points out, these are slave virtues. There should be room in ourideal for the virtues of the ruler and leader-courage, energy, justice andintegrity. Christianity has nothing to tell us about the dynamic virtues;consequently those who get the world's work done cannot follow the Christianideal because of its limitations and inapplicability to their problems. They canmeasure right and wrong against no standard save their own self-respect. Theresult is the ridiculous spectacle of a civilisation, committed to a one-sidedideal, being forced to keep its ideals and its honour in separate compartments.23. We need Geburah's realism to balance Gedulah's idealism quite as much as weneed to temper justice with mercy. Experience in the handling of children soonteaches us that the child that is never checked is a spoilt child; that theyouth who lacks the spur of competition is apt to be a slack youth, for it isonly the few who will work for work's sake. And so it is with nations; Themonopoly, lacking the spur of competition, has always proved itself to beineffectual; the non-competitive professions always suffer from intellectualobesity.24. Geburah is the dynamic element in life that drives through and overobstacles. The character which is lacking in Martian aspects never gets to gripswith life. Those who have had to depend on a non-Geburah bread-winner know thatlove is not a complete solution of life's problems. We must learn to love andtrust the mailed warrior with the sword as well as Divine Love which gives usthe cup of cold water and says, \"Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavyladen.\"25. When we have learnt to kiss the rod and realise the value of astringentexperiences we have taken the first of the Geburah initiations; and when we havelearnt to lose our lives in order to find them, we have taken the second. Thereis a certain type of courage which does not fear dissolution, for it knows thatall spiritual principles are indestructible, and so long as the archetypespersist, anything can be rebuilt. Geburah is only destructive to that which istemporal; it is the servant of that which is eternal; for when by the acidactivity of Geburah all that is impermanent has been eaten away, the eternal andincorporeal realities shine forth in all their glory, every line revealed.26. Geburah is the best friend we can have if we are honest.[Page 182]Sincerity has no need to fear his activities; indeed, it is the greatest we canhave against the insincerity of others for there is nothing to equal theGeburah-influence for debunking\" both persons and viewpoints.27. Geburah and Gedulah must work together; never the one without the other. Wemust adore the God of Battles as well as the God of Love in order that thecombative element in the universe may not break from its allegiance to the OneGod, I Am That I Am. The sword must not be cursed as an instrument of the Devil,but blessed and dedicated in Mystical Qabala Page 124order that it may never be unsheathed in an unrighteous cause. It must not becast aside in an impracticable pacifism, but placed at God's service; so thatwhen the command goes forth that the evil thing shall not be suffered anylonger, the mighty Khamael, Archangel of Geburah, may lead the Seraphim intobattle, not in destructive rage, but temperately and impersonally in God'sservice in order that evil may be cleared up and good prevail.III28. So much has already been said concerning the nature of Geburah that a greatdeal does not remain to say in the analysis of the attribution.29. The Yetziratic Text tells us that the Fifth Path is called the RadicalIntelligence because it resembles Unity. Now Unity is one of the titles appliedto Kether; therefore we may say that Geburah is akin to Kether on a lower arc.There are several Sephiroth which are thus referred to in the Sepher Yetzirah,and these references are very important when arriving at an understanding oftheir nature. Chokmah is spoken of as the Splendour of Unity, equalling it. OfBinah it is said that its roots are in Amen, which is also a title of Kether.30. Geburah is a highly dynamic Sephirab, and its energy overflowing into theworld of form and energising it bears a close analogy to the overflowing forceof Kether, which is the basis of all manifestation. It is also said of Geburahin the Yetziratic Text that it~nites itself to Binah, Understanding. When we recall that in astrology Saturn,the Mundane Chakra of Binah, and Mars, the Mundane Chakra of Geburah, are calledthe Greater and Lesser Infortunes, we see that there must be more than asuperficial connection between the two.32. Binah is called the bringer-in of death because it is the giver of form toprimordial force, thus rendering it static; Geburah is called the Destroyerbecause the fiery Mars-force breaks down forms and destroys them. Thus we seethat Binah is perpetually binding force into form, and Geburah perpetuallybreaking up and destroying all forms with its disruptive energy.33. But equally we must see that it is only when the protecting, preservinginfluence of Chesed is in abeyance that the destructive influences of Geburahare able to work upon the forms built up by Binah, for the path of theEmanations between Binah and Geburah is via Chesed. Geburah is the essentialcorrective of Binah, without which Binah would bind all creation into rigidity.Binah, in its turn, as is pointed out in the Yetziratic Text, emanates from theprimordial depths of Cliokmah, Wisdom. Thus we see that there is a dynamicaspect even to Binah. No Sephirah is wholly of one kind of force, for eachemanates from a SephiAah of the opposite type of polarity to itself, and in itsturn emanates a Sephirah of opposite polarity. What we really have in theLightning Flash is successive phases in the development of a single force; andbecause these emanate, but do not supersede each other, they remun as planes ofmanifestation and types of organisation.Mystical Qabala Page 12534. These successive phases and planes of manifestation might be likened to thesuccessive reaches of a river. It starts as a mountain stream; in the next reachis a series of rapids and waterfalls; then come water-meadows and placidity; andfinally the great waterway between docks bearing shipping. The different reachesof the river remain constant; the type of water in each is constant; clear andsparkling in the upper reaches, loaded with alluvia among the water-meadows, and[Page 184]fouled with grime below the docks. But at the same time) the water itself is notconstant, for it does not stagnate on any reach, for they are all in unbrokencommunication the one with the other; they \"emanate\" each other, to use thelanguage of the Qabalah. But the water changes its nature as it progressesbecause something is added to it by the experiences it undergoes in each reach;alluvial soil from the water-meadows; city grime from the docks.35. So the primordial emanation of Kether becomes modi fled in each Sephirotic\"reach\"of the cosmic river; the reaches,\" or Sephirotic Spheres, remain constant; theemanations flow on, undergoing modification in each Sphere.36. The titles assigned to Geburah of Strength, Justice, Severity, and Fearspeak for themselves and indicate the dual aspects of this Sephirah. Now that weare coming down the Tree into the planes of form we see more and more clearlythat every Sephirah is two-sided, and that its overplus tends to unbalancedforce.37. The Magical Image of a mighty warrior in his chariot, crowned and armed,indicates the dynamic nature of the Geburah-force. The Mundane Chakra of thefiery Mars expresses even more fully the same idea.38. The Spiritual Experience that is conveyed by initiation into the Sphere ofGeburah is the Vision of Power. It is only when a man has received this that bebecomes an Adeptus Major. The right handling of power is one of the greatesttests that can be imposed on any human being. Up to this point in his progressup the grades an initiate learns the lessons of discipline, control, andstability; he acquires, in fact, what Nietzsche calls slave-morality-a verynecessary discipline for unregenerate human nature, so proud in its own conceit.With the grade of Adeptus Major, however, he must acquire the virtues of thesuperman, and learn to wield power instead of to submit to it. But even so, heis not a law unto himself, for he is the servant of the power he wields and mustcarry out its purposes, not serve his own. Though no longer responsible to hisfellow-men he is still responsible to the Creator of heaven and earth, and willbe required to give an account of his stewardship.39. Great freedom is his; but also great strain. He can speak the word of powerthat unlooses the wind, but he must be prepared to ride the ensuing whirlwind.This is a thing that the amateur magician does not always realise.Mystical Qabala Page 12640. The energy and courage which are the virtues of Mars, and the cruelty anddestruction which are his vices when these qualities run to excess, call for nocomment, for they are self-explanatory.41. The symbols assigned to Mars-Geburah need some elucidation, however, as.their significance is not in all cases apparent at first sight.42. Figures with a varying number of sides are assigned to the differentplanets, and in ceremonial or talismanic magic are used as the outline of anyform associated with a planetary force. To Saturn, the oldest planet, the firstto develop in evolutionary time, is assigned the simplest two-dimensionalfigure-the triangle. The balanced stability of Chesed gets the four-sidedfigure, the square; and to the third planetary Sephirah, Mars, is assigned thefive-sided figure, and five is looked upon in the Qabalistic system as thenumber of Mars. Consequently the Pentagon, the five-sided figure, is the symbolof Mars, and any altar to Mars should be pentagonal or five-sided, likewise anytalisman. The five-petalled Tudor rose, which is another symbol of Mars,requires more explanation; but when we remember the intimate association betweenMars and Venus in mythology, and that the rose is the flower of Venus, we get aclue to the significance of the symbolism.The lines of force, crossing over on the Tree, go from GeburahMars toNetzach-Venus through Tiphareth, the Place of the Redeemer, the centre ofequilibrium, in the same way that Caesed and Hod connect up, as is clearlyindicated in the Yetziratic Text, which says of Hod that it has its root in thehidden places of Gedulah, the Fourth Sephirah.43. Realising, then, the intimate relationship between the diagonal pairs thatform the four corners of the central square[Page 186]of the Tree, we understand the linked relationship indicated by the form of therose with its five petals.44. The sword, the spear, the scourge, and the chain are all such characteristicweapons of Mars that no comment is called for.45. The four Fives of the Tarot pack are all evil cards, each according to itstype. In fact, the five suit of Swords, which is under the presidency of Mars,represents contentiousness. for its best aspects are \"Rest from strife\" and\"Success after struggle,\"and where a Sword card is associated with a Sephirah whose Mundane Chakra is oneof the astrological infortunes, the result is disastrous, and we find the Lordsof Defeat and Ruin in this suit.46. Our ability to take the Geburah initiation depends upon our ability tohandle the Martian forces, and this is determined by the degree ofself-discipline and stability we have attained in our own natures.Mystical Qabala Page 12747. Geburah is the most dynamic and forceful of all the Sephiroth, but it isalso the most highly disciplined. Indeed, the military discipline, presided overby the god of War, is a synonym for the sternest kind of control that can beimposed upon human beings. The discipline of Geburah must exactly equate withits energy; in other words, the brakes of a car must bear a relationship to itshorse-power if it is to be safe on the road. It is this tremendous Geburahdiscipline which is one of the testing-points of the Mysteries. We speak of aniron discipline, and iron is the metal of Mars.48. The initiate of Geburah is a very dynamic and forceful person, but he isalso a very controlled person. His characteristic virtues are an even temper andpatience under provocation. It is well known on the sports field, which is theplay~aspect of the god of War, that a loss of temper gives the game away. Everyboxer knows that if he gets angry and starts fighting instead of boxing, theodds are against him. The initiate of Mars is essentially the Happy Warrior, theinitiate who has passed through the grade of Tiphareth and gained equilibrium.49. He fights without malice; he spares the weak and wounded; he does not setOut to destroy the law but to see to it that it is properly fulfilled. He is thecorrector of the balance, and as such is always the defender of the weak andoppressed. He is never a god that is found on the side of the large armies,although he says, \"With the froward I will show myself froward.\" He takes thattwo-headed giant of the Qliphoth, Thaumiel, the Dual Contending Forces, knockshis heads together and says, \"A plague on both your houses! Keep God's peace orit will be the worse for you.\"50. When a soul is at that stage of development when the only way it can learnis by experience, Geburah sees that it shall not be disappointed when it goesabout looking for trouble. Geburah is the Great Initiator of the swollen-headed.CHAPTER XXTIPHARETH, THE SIXTH SEPHIRAHTITLE: Tiphareth, Beauty. (Hebrew spelling: Tau, Pe, Aleph, Resh, Tau.) MAGICALIMAGE: A majestic king.

There are three important keys to the nature of Tiphareth. Firstly, it is thecentre of equilibrium of the whole 'rree, being in the middle of the CentralPillar; secondly, it is Kether on a lower arc and Yesod on a higher arc;thirdly, it is the point of transmutation between the planes of force and theplanes of form. The titles that are bestowed on it in Qabalistic nomenclaturebear this out. From the point of view of Kether it is a child; from the point ofview of Malkuth it is a king; and from the point of view of the transmutation offorce it is a sacrificed god.Mystical Qabala Page 1292. Macrocosmically, that is to say from the Kether standpoint, Tiphareth is theequilibrium of Chesed and Geburah; microcosmically, that is to say from thepoint of view of transcendental psychology, it is the point where the types ofconsciousness characteristic of Kether and Yesod are brought to a focus. Hod andNetzach equally find their synthesis in Tiphareth.3. The six Sephiroth, of which Tiphareth is the centre, are sometimes calledAdam Kadmon, the archetypal man; in fact, Tiphareth cannot rightly be understoodsave as the central point of these six, wherein it rules as a king in hiskingdom. It is these six which, for all practical purposes, constitute theatchetypal kingdom which lies behind the kingdom of form in Malkuth andcompletely dominates and determines the passivities of matter.4. When we have to consider a Sephirah in relation to its neighbours in order tointerpret in the light of its position on the Tree, it is not possible toproceed with an entirely systematic and orderly exposition of the Qabalisticsystem, for we must of necessity forestall with partial explanations if ourargument is to be comprehensible. We must therefore give Some explanation of thethree lower Sephiroth grouped around Tiphareth,Netzach, Hod, and Yesod.5. Netzach is concerned with the Nature forces and ele-mental contacts; Hod withceremonial magic and occult[Page 190]knowledge; and Yesod with psychism and the etheric double. Tiphareth itself,supported by Geburah and Gedulah, re presents seership, or the higher psychismof the individuality, Each Sephirah, of course, has its subjective and objectiveaspects-its factor in psychology and its plane in the universe,6. The four Sephiroth below Tiphareth represent the pet sonality or lower self;the four Sephiroth above Tiphareth are the Individuality, or higher self, andKether is the Divine Spark, or nucleus of manifestation.7. Tiphareth, therefore, must never be regarded as an isolated factor, but as alink, a focussing-point, a centre of transition or transmutation. The CentralPillar is alwavs concerned with consciousness. The two side Pillars with thedifferent modes of the operation of force on the different levels.8. In Tiphareth we find the archetypal ideals brought to a focus and transmutedinto archetypal ideas. It is, in fact, the Place of Incarnation. For this reasonit is called the Child. And because incarnation of the god-ideal also impliesthe sacrificial disincarnation, to Tiphareth are assigned the Mysteries of theCrucifixion, and all the Sacrificed Gods are placed here when the Tree isapplied to the pantheons. God the Father is assigned to Kether; but God the Sonis assigned to Tiphareth for the reasons given above.Mystical Qabala Page 1309. Exoteric religion goes no farther up the Tree than Tiphareth. It has nounderstanding of the mysteries of creation as represented by the symbolism ofKether, Chokmah, and Binah; nor of the modes of operation of the Dark and BrightArchangels as represented in the symbolism of Geburah and Gedulah; nor of themysteries of consciousness and the transmutation of force as represented in theinvisible Sephirab Daath, which has no symbolism.10. In Tiphareth God is made manifest in form and dwells among us; i.e. comeswithin range of human consciousness. Tiphareth, the Son, \"shows us\" Kether, theFather.11. In order that form may be stabilised, the component forces out of which itis built must be brought into equllibrium. Therefore do we find the idea of theMediator, or Redeemer, inherent in this Sephirah. When the Godhead in its verySelf manifests in form, that form must be perfectly equilibrated. One might withequal truth reverse the proposition and say that when the forces building a formare perfectly equilibrated, the Godhead its very Self is manifesting in thatform according to its type. God is made manifest arnong us when the conditionspermit of manifestation.12. Having come through into manifestation on the planes of form in the Childaspect of Tiphareth, the incarnated god grows to manhood and becomes theRedeemer. In other words, having obtained incarnation by means of matter in avirgin state, i.e. Mary, Marah, the Sea, the Great Mother, Binah, a Supernal, asdistinguished from the Inferior Mother, Malkuth, the developingGod-manifestation, is for ever striving to bring the Kingdom of the six centralSephiroth into a state of equilibrium.13. When the glyph of the Fall is represented upon the Tree it is interesting tonote that the heads of the Great Serpent that rises out of Chaos only come asfar as Tiphareth and do not overpass it.14. The Redeemer, then, manifests in Tiphareth, and is for ever striving toredeem His Kingdom by re-uniting it to the Supernals across the gulf made by theFall, which separated the lower Sephiroth from the higher, and by bringing thediverse forces of the sixfold kingdom into equilibrium.15. To this end are the incarnated gods sacrificed, dying for the people, inorder that the tremendous emotional force set free by this act may compensatethe unbalanced force of the Kingdom and thus redeem it or bring it intoequilibrium.16. It is this Sphere on the Tree that is called the Christ-centre, and it ishere that the Christian religion has its focussing-point. The pantheisticfaiths, such as the Greek and Egyptian, centre in Yes od; and the metaphysicalfaiths, such as the Buddhist and Confucian, aim at Kether. But as all religionsworthy of the name have both an esoteric, or mystical, and an exoteric, orpantheistic, aspect, Christianity, although it is essentially a Tiphareth faith,has its mystical aspect centring in[Page 192]Mystical Qabala Page 131Kether, and its magical aspect, as seen in popular continental Catholicism,centring in Yesod. Its evangelical aspect aims at a concentration on Tipharethas Child and Sacrificed God, and ignores the aspect of the King in the centre ofhis Kingdom, surrounded by the five Holy Sephiroth of manifestation.17. Hitherto we have considered the Tree from the macrocosmic point of view,seeing the different archetypes of manifesting force come into action and buildthe universe, and have but remotely approached them from the microcosmic pointof view in their psychological aspect as factors in consciousness. But withTiphareth our mode of approach changes, for from henceforward the archetypalforces are locked up in forms, and can only be approached from the point of viewof their effect upon consciousness; in other words, our mode of approach mustnow be through the direct experience of the senses, though these senses are notof the physical plane only, but function in both Tiphareth and Yesod, eachaccording to type. While we were on the higher levels we had to rely onmetaphysical analogy and reasoning by deduction frorn first principles; now weare within the legitimate field of inductive science, and must submit ourselvesto its discipline and express our findings in its terms; but at the same time wemust maintain our link with the transcendentals through Tiphareth; this isachieved by expressing the symbolism of Tiphareth in terms of mysticalexperience. All mystical experiences of the type in which the vision ends inblinding light are assigned to Tiphareth; for the fading-out of form in theoverwhelming influx of force characterises the transitional mode' ofconsciousness of this Sphere on the Tree. Visions which maintain clearlyoutlined form throughout are characteristic of Yesod. Illuminations which haveno form, such as those described by Plotinus, are rising towards Kether.18. In Tiphareth also are gathered up and interpreted the operations of thenature magic of Netzach and the Hermetic magic of Hod. Both these operations arein terms of form, though form predominates in the operation of Hod to a, greaterdegree than in those of Netzach. All the astral visions of Yesod also must betranslated into terms of metaphysics via the mystical experiences of Tiphareth.If this translation is not made, we become hallucinated; for we think thereflections cast into the mirror of the subconscious mind and translated thereinto terms of brain-consciousness are the actual things of which they are reallyonly the symbolic representations.19. Kether is metaphysical; Yesod is psychic; and Tiphareth is essentiallymystical; mystical being understood as a mode of mentation in whichconsciousness ceases to work in symbolic subconscious representations butapprehends by means of emotional reactions.20. The different additional titles and symbolism assigned to the variousSephiroth, and especially the God-names thereof, give us a very important keyfor the unlocking of the mysteries of the Bible, which is essentially aQabalistic book. According to the manner in which Deity is referred to, we knowto what Sphere on the Tree the particular mode of manifestation should beassigned. All references to the Son always refer to Tiphareth; all references tothe Father refer to Kether; all references to the Holy Ghost refer to Yesod; andvery deep mysteries are concealed here, for the Holy Ghost is the aspect of theMystical Qabala Page 132Godhead that is worshipped in the occult lodges; the worship of pantheisticnature-forces and elemental operations take place under the presidency of Godthe Father; and the regenerative ethical aspect of religion, which is theexoteric aspect for this epoch, is under the presidency of God the Son inFiphareth.21. The initiate, however, transcends his epoch, and aims at uniting all threemodes of adoration in his worship of Deity as a trinity in unity; the Sonredeeming the pantheistic nature worship from debasement and making thetranscendental Father comprehensible to human consciousness, for \"whoso bathseen Me hath seen the Father.\"22. Tiphareth, however, is not only the centre of the Sacrificed God, but alsothe centre of the Inebriating God, the Giver of Iliumination. Dionysos isassigned to this centre[Page 194]as well as Osiris, for, as we have already seen, the Central Pillar is concernedwith the modes of consciousness; and human consciousness, rising from Yesod bythe Path of the Arrow, receives i~umination in Tiphareth; therefore all thegivers of illumination in the Pantheons are assigned to Tiphareth.23. Illumination consists in the introduction of the mind to a higher mode ofconsciousness than that which is built up out of sensory experience. Inillumination the mind changes gear, as it were. Unless, however) the new mode ofconsciousness is connected up with the old and translated into terms of finitethought, it remains as a flash of light so brilliant that it blinds. We do notsee by means of the ray of light that shines upon us, but by means of the amountof that ray which is reflected from objects of our own dimension upon which itlights. Unless there are ideas in our minds which are illuminated by this highermode of consciousness, our minds are merely overwhelmed, and the darkness ismore intense to our eyes after that blinding experience of a high mode ofconsciousness than it was before. In fact, we do not so much change gear asthrow the engine of our mind out of gear altogether. This, for the most part, iswhat so-called illumination amounts to. There is enough of a flash to convinceus of the reality of super-physical existence, but not enough to teach usanything of its nature.24. The importance of the Tiphareth stage in mystical experience lies in thefact that the incarnation of the Child takes place here; in other words,mystical experience gradually builds up a body of images and ideas that are litup and made visible when illuminations take place.25. This Child aspect of Tiphareth is also a very important one to us in suchpractical work of the Mysteries as is concerned with illumination. For we mustaccept the fact that the Child-Christ does not spring like Minerva, full-armedfrom the head of God the Father, but starts as a small thing, humbly laid amongthe beasts and not even housed in the {? i1?n} with the humans. The firstglimpses of mystical experience must perforce be very limited because we havenot had time to build up through experience a body of images and ideas thatshall serve to represent them. These can only be got together with MysticalQabala Page 133time, each transcendental experience adding its quota and subsequent rationalmeditation organising them.26. Mystics are very apt to make the mistake of thinking that they are followingthe Star to the place of the Sermon on the Mount, not to the Manger atBethlehem, the birth-place.It is here that the method of the Tree is so valuable, enabling the transcendentto be expressed in terms of symbolism, and symbolism to be translated into termsof metaphysics ; thus linking the psychic with the spiritual via the intellect,and bringing all three aspects of our trinitarian consciousness into focus.27. It is in Tiphareth that this translation is made, for in Tiphareth arereceived the mystical experiences of direct consciousness which illuminate thepsychic symbols.II28. The Central Pillar of the Tree is essentially the Pillar of Consciousness,just as the two side Pillars are the Pillars of the active and passive powers.When considered microcosnuc-ally, that is to say from the point of view ofpsychology instead of cosmology, Kether, the Divine Spark round which theindividualised being builds up, must be regarded as the nucleus of consciousnessrather than consciousness itself Daath, the invisible Sephirah, is also on theCentral Pillar, though, strictly speaking, it always belongs to another plane tothat on which the Tree is being considered. For instance, as we are consideringthe Tree microcosmically at the moment, Daath would be the point of contact withthe macrocosm. It is not until we come to Tiphareth that we get clear-cut,individualised consciousness.29. Tiphareth is the functional apex of the Second Triad on the Tree, whose twobasal angles consist of Geburah and Gedulah (Chesed). This Second Triad,emanating from the[Page 196]First Triad of the Three Supernals, forms the evolving individuality, orspiritual soul. It is this which endures and builds up throughout an evolution;it is from this that the successive personalities, the units of incarnation, areemanated; it is into this that the active essence of experience is absorbed atthe end of each incarnation when the incarnating unit dissolves into dust andether.30. It is this Second Triad which forms the Oversoul, the Higher Self, the HolyGuardian Angel, the First Initiator. It is the voice of this higher self whichis so often heard with the inner ear, and not the voice of discarnate entities,or of God Himself, as is thought by those who have had no training in tradition.31. Overshadowed and directed by the Second Triad, the Third Triad builds upthrough the experience of incarnation, with Malkuth as its physical vehicle.Brain consciousness Mystical Qabala Page 134is of Malkuth, and as long as we are imprisoned in Malkuth, that is all we have.But the doors of Malkuth are not closely shut nowadays, and many there are whocan peer through the crack at the phantasmagoria of the astral plane andexperience the psychic consciousness of Yesod. When this has been achieved theway opens for the higher psychism, the true seership, which is characteristic ofthe consciousness of Tiphareth.32. Our first experience of the higher psychism, therefore, is usually in termsof the lower psychism to commence with; for we have only just risen clear ofMalkuth, and are looking up at the Sun of Tiphareth from the Moon-sphere ofYesod. Therefore we hear voices with the inner ear and see visions with theinner eye, but they differ from ordinary psychic consciousness because they arenot the direct representations of astral forms, but symbolic presentations ofspiritual things in terms of astral consciousness. This is a normal function ofthe subconscious mind, and it is very important that it should be thoroughlyunderstood, for misconceptions on this point give rise to very serious problemsand may even lead to mental unbalance.33. Those who are familiar with Qabalistic terminology know that the first ofthe greater initiations is said to consist of the power to enjoy the knowledgeand conversation of our Holy Guardian Angel; this Holy Guardian Angel, be itremembered, is really our own higher self. It is the prime characteristic ofthis higher mode of mentation that it consists neither in voices nor visions,but is pure consciousness; it is an intensification of awareness, and from thisquickening of the mind comes a peculiar power of insight and penetration whichis of the nature of hyper-developed intuition. The higher consciousness is neverpsychic, but always intuitive, containing no sensory imagery. It is this absenceof sensory imagery which tells the experienced initiate that he is on the levelof the higher consciousness.34. The ancients recognised this, and they differentiated between the manticmethods which induced the chthonic, or underworld contacts, and the divineinebriation of the Mysteries. The Mienads rushing in the train of Dionysos wereof an entirely different order of initiation to the pytho-nesses; thepythonesses were psychics and mediums, but the Monads, the initiates of theDionysiac Mysteries, enjoyed exaltation of consciousness and a quickening oflife that enabled them to perform amazing prodigies of strength.35. All the dynamic religions have this Dionysiac aspect; even in the Christianreligion many saints have left record of the Crucified Christ of their devotioncoming to them at last as the Divine Bridegroom; and when they speak of thisdivine inebriation that comes to them, their language uses the metaphors ofhuman love as its appropriate expression-\"How lovely art thou, my sister, my spouse.\"-\" Faint from the kisses of the lipsof God . . .\" These things tell a great deal to those who have understanding.36. The Dionysiac aspect of religion represents an essential factor in humanpsychology, and it is the misunderstanding of this factor which upon the onehand prevents the manifrstation of the higher spiritual experiences in ourmodern civilisation, and upon the other permits of the strange aberrations ofreligious feeling that from time to time give rise to scandalMystical Qabala Page 135[Page 198]and tragedy in the high places of the more dynamic religious movements.37. There is a certain emotional concentration and exalta tion which makes thehigher phases of consciousness available, and without which it is impossible toattain them. The images of the astral plane pass over into an intensity ofemotion that is like a burning fire, and when all the dross of the nature hasgone up in flame the smoke clears, and we are left with the white heat of pureconsciousness. By the very nature of the human mind, with the brain as itsinstrument) this white heat cannot endure for long; but in the brief space ofits lasting, changes occur in the temperament, and the mind itself receives newconcepts and undergoes an expansion that never wholly retracts. The tremendousexaltation of the experience dies away, but we are left with a permanentexpansion of personality, an enhanced capacity for life in general, and a powerof realisation of spiritual realities which could never have been ours if we hadnot been swung forcibly across the great gulf of consciousness by the momentumof ecstasy.38. Modern spiritual leaders have no knowledge of the technique of thedeliberate production of ecstasy and no idea how to direct it when it occursspontaneously.Revivalists succeed in producing a mild form of it among unsophisticated peopleby means of personal magnetism, and the worth of a revivalist is judged by hispower to inebriate his hearers. But the consequences of this inebriation are aptto be like the consequences of any other inebriation, and life seems exceedinglystale, flat, and unprofitable when the revivalist moves on to other fields ofactivity. Because the inebriation dies away, the convert thinks he has lost God;no one seems to realise that ecstasy is a magnesium flash in consciousness, andif it were prolonged, would burn up the brain and nervous system. But althoughit cannot be, and is not meant to be, prolonged, by means of it we swing overthe dead centre of consciousness and awake to a higher life.39. The technique of the Tree gives accurate definition to these spiritualexperiences, and those who are trained in that technique do not mistake thestirring of their own higher consciousness for the voice of God. From thesensory consciousness of Malkuth, through the astral psychism of Yesod, to theformless intuitions and quickened consciousness of Tiphareth they rise anddescend smoothly and skilfully; never confusing the planes or suffering them toleak one into another, but bringing them all into focus in a centralisedconsciousness.III40. Tiphareth is called by the Qabalists Shemesh, or the Sphere of the Sun; andit is interesting to note that all sun-gods are healing gods, and all healinggods are sun-gods, a fact which affords us food for thought.41. The sun is the central point of our existence. Without the sun there wouldbe no solar system. Sunlight plays a very important part in the metabolism, thelife-process, of living creatures, and the whole of the nutrition of greenplants depends upon it. Its influence is Mystical Qabala Page 136closely allied to that of vitamins, as is proved by the fact that certainvitamins can be used to supplement its activities. We see, therefore, thatsunlight is a very important factor in our well-being; we might go even furtherand say that it is essential to our very existence and that our association withthe sun is far more intimate than we realise.42. The symbol of the sun in the mineral kingdom is gold, pure and precious,which all nations have agreed in calling the metal of the sun and recognising asthe most precious metal and the basic unit of exchange. The part played by goldin the polity of nations far exceeds its intrinsic utility as a metal. It is,moreover, the one substance on earth which is incorruptible and untarnishable.It may be dulled by the accumulation of dirt upon its surface, but the metalitself, unlike silver or iron, undergoes no chemical change or decomposition.Neither does water corrode it.43. The sun is to us truly the Giver of Life and source of all being; it is theonly adequate symbol of God the Father, who[Page 200]may aptly be called the Sun behind the Sun, Tiphareth, in fact, being theimmediate reflection of Kether. It is through the mediation of the sun that lifecomes to the earth, and it is by means of the Tipharic consciousness that wecontact the sources of vitality and draw upon them, both consciously andunconsciously.44. The sun is, above all things, the symbol of manifesting energy; it issudden, unaccustomed gushes of solar-spiritual energy that cause the divineinebriation of ecstasy; it is gold, as the basis of money, which is theobjective representative of externalised life-force; for verily, money is lifeand life is money, for without money we can have no fullness of life.Life-force, manifesting on the physical plane as energy and on the mental planeas intelligence and knowledge, can be transmuted by the appropriate alchemy intomoney, which is a token of the capacity or energy of someone. Money is thesymbol of human energy, by means of which we can store up our output of workhour by hour, receiving it back as wages at the end of the week, and spending iton necessities or saving it for future use as we think fit. The gold which backsthe notes is a symbol of human energy, and is only earned by an expenditure ofthat energy; though it may be the energy of a father or a husband, transmittedthrough an heiress, yet nevertheless it is the symbol of some human being'sactivity in some sphere, even if it be only the sphere of company-promoting orburglary.45. The secret, underground movements of gold act in the polity of nations ashormones act in the human body, and there are cosmic laws governing their tidaland epochal movements which economists do not suspect.46. Kether, Space, the source of all existence, reflects into Tiphareth, whichacts as a transformer and distributor of the primal, spiritual energy. Wereceive this energy directly by means of sunlight, and indirectly by means ofthe chlorophyll in green plants, which Mystical Qabala Page 137enables them to utilise sunlight, and which we eat at first hand in vegetablefoods, and at second hand in the tissues of herbivorous creatures 47. But theSun-god is more than the source of life. He is also the healer when life goeswrong. For it is life, plus, minus, or misdirected, which is the activity indisease processes; disease has no energy save what it borrows from the life ofthe organism. It is therefore by adjustments in the life-force that healing mustbe brought about, and the sun-gods are the natural gods to invoke in thisconnection, for life and the sun are so intimately connected.48. It is by means of their knowledge of the manipulation of the solar influencethat the ancient initiate-priests performed their healings, and sun-worship layat the root of the IEsculapian cult of ancient Greece.49. We moderns have learnt the value of sunlight and vitamins in ourphysiological economy, but we have not realised the very important part playedby the spiritual aspect of the solar influences in our psychic economy, usingthat word in its dictionary sense.There is a Tipharic factor in the soul of man which, according to ancienttradition, has its physical correspondence in the solar plexus, not in the heador the heart, which is able to pick up the subtle aspect of the solar energy inthe same way that the chlorophyll in the leaf of a plant picks up its moretangible aspect. If we are cut off from this energy and prevented fromassimilating it, we become as sickly and feeble in mind and body as.plants growing in a cellar cut off from its more tangible aspect.50. This cutting-off from the spiritual aspect of Nature is due to mentalattitudes. When we refuse to acknowledge our part in Nature, and Nature's partin us, we inhibit this free flow of life-giving magnetism between the part andthe whole; and lacking certain elements essential to spiritual function, psychichealth is impossible.51. Psycho-analysts attach great importance to repression as a cause of psychicdisease; they learnt to recognise repression because in its extreme form ofsex-repression its ill effects are conspicuous. They did not realise, however,that sex-repression, unless it is caused by circumstances, in which case it doesnot give rise to dissociation, is but the result of a cause[Page 202]which lies far deeper than sex, and has its roots in a false spirituality, aspurious refinement and idealism, which has led to the cutting-off of thesympathies, of the recognition, of the gratitude of a living creature from theGiver of Life, the higher aspect of Nature. This is caused by a spiritual vanitvwhich considers the more primitive aspects of nature as beneath its dignity.52. It is because of our spurious ideals with their false values that we have somuch neurotic ill-health in our midst. It is because Priapus and Cloacina arenot given their due Mystical Qabala Page 138as deities that we are cursed by the Sun-god and cut off from Ilis benigninfluence, for an insult to His subsidiary aspects is an insult to Him.53. When a creature is not in a fit state for reproduction, sexual advances arerepellent to it; this is the natural basis of modesty and protects the organismfrom waste and exhaustion. Because an accumulation of decomposing excreta givesrisc to disease, the odour of their excreta is repulsive to living creatures ofeven the lowliest development, so that the; avoid its neighbourhood. Out ofthese two repulsions, so rational and valuable under natural conditions, underour artificial conditions of civilised life all manner of irrational taboos havegrown up. The repulsion is overdone, and no longer serves its biologicalpurpose.54. Our attitude towards two important sections of natural life implies thatthey are unnatural, debased, poisonous. Consequently we cut ourselves off fromthe earth-contacts; thcn the circuit is broken and the heavenly contacts alsofail us. The cosmic current comes down from Kether, through Tiphareth and Yesod,into Malkuth; if the circuit be broken anywhere, it cannot function. True, it isimpossible totally to break the circuit during life, for the life-processes are50 deeply rooted in nature that we cannot altogether suppress them; but a mentalattitude can cause such a kinking of the tube, as it were, can so insulate andinhibit, that only a scanty flow can be sucked through against resistance by thedesperate organism.55. In Tiphareth, the Sun Centre, we have the spiritual manifesting in thenatural, and we should give reverence to the Sun-god as representing thenaturalisation of spiritual processes ; the spiritualisation of naturalprocesses has had a good deal to answer for in the history of human suffering.IV56. The symbols assigned to the Sixth Sephirab become a very illunimating studywhen we examine them in the light of what we now know about the signifi( ance ofTiphareth, for we have here a very clear example of the way in which the symbolsassigned to a given Sephirah lace in and out, in and out, in long chains ofinterrelated associations.57. The meaning of the Hebrew word Tiphareth is Beauty; and of the manydefinitions of beauty that have been proposed, the most satisfying is that whichfinds beauty to Jie in a due and just proportion, whatever the beautiful thingmay be, whether moral or material.It is interesting, therefore, to find the Sephirah of Beauty as the centralpoint of equilibrium of the whole Tree, and that one of the two SpiritualExpexiences assigned to Tiphareth is the Vision of the Harmony of Things.58. It is curious tnat two separate and, at first sight, unrelated SpiritualExperiences should be assigned to Tiphareth; it is, in fact, the only Sphere onthe Tree where this Mystical Qabala Page 139occurs. It is also unique in having several Magical Images assigned to it. Wemust therefore ask ourselves why it is that the central Sephirah has thesemultiple aspects. The answer is to be found in the Yetziratic Text assigned toTiphareth, which declares that\"The Sixth Path is called the Mediating Intelligence. A mediator is essentiallya connecting link, an intermediary; consequently Tiphareth, in its centralposition, must be looked upon as a two-way switch, and we must Consider it bothas receiving the\"influxes of the Emanations\" and as \"causing that influence to flow into all thereservoirs of the blessings.\" We may therefore look upon it as the out-wardmanifestation of the five subtler Sephiroth, and also as[Page 204]the spiritual principle behind the four denser Sephiroth. If looked at from theside of form, it is force; if looked at from the side of force, it is form. Itis, in fact, the archetypal Sephirah in which the great principles representedby the five higher Sephiroth are formulated into concepts; \"In it are multipliedthe influxes of the Emanations,\" as the Sepher Yetzirah declares.59. The name Zoar Anpin, Lesser Countenance, as dis tinguished from Arik Anpin,the Vast Countenance, one of the titles of Kether, further bears out this idea.For the formless formulations of Kether take shape in this, the sphere of thehigher mind. As previously noted, Kether is reflected into Tiphareth. TheAncient of Days sees Himself reflected as in a glass, and the reflected image ofthe Vast Countenance is called the Lesser Countenance and the Son.60. But although a lesser manifestation and a younger generation as viewed fromabove, Tiphareth is also Adam Kadmon, the Archetypal Man, when viewed frombeneath-from the side, that is to say, of Yesod and Malkuth. Tiphareth is Malek,the King, the husband of Malkab, the Bride, which is one of the titles ofMalkuth.61. It is in Tiphareth that we find the archetypal ideas which form theinvisible framework of the whole of manifested creation formulating andexpressing the primary principles emanating from the subtler Sephiroth. It is,as it were, a Treasure-house of Images on a higher arc; but whereas the astralplane is peopled by images reflected from forms, the images of the Sphere ofTiphareth are those formulating, and as it were crystallising out, from thespiritual emanations of the higher potencies.62. Tiphareth mediates between the microcosm and the macrocosm; \"As above, sobelow,\" is the keynote of the Sphere of Shemesh, wherein the Sun that is behindthe sun focusses into manifestation.63. In the anatomy of the Divine Man is the interpretation of all organisationand evolution; in fact, the material universe. is literally the organs andmembers of this Divine Man; and it is through an understanding of the soul ofAdam Kadmon, which consists of the \"infiuxes of the Emanations,\" that we caninterpret His anatomy in terms of function, which is the only way in whichanatomy can be intelligently appreciated. It is because Mystical Qabala Page 140science is content largely to be descriptive, and shrinks from purposiveexplanations, that it is so barren of all philosophical import.64. In transcendental psychology, which is the anatomy of the microcosm, thebreast is the correspondence assigned to Tiphareth. In the breast are the lungsand the heart, and immediately below these organs, and intimately connected withthem and controlling them, is the greatest network of nerves in the body, knownas the solar plexus, aptly so named by the ancient anatomists. The lungsmaintain a singularly intimate relationship between the microcosm and themacrocosm by determining the ceaseless tidal motion of the atmosphere, in andout, in and out, that never ceases day or night, until the golden bowl is brokenand the silver cord is loosed and we cease to breathe. The heart determines thecirculation of the blood, and the blood, as Paracelsus truly said, is a\"singular fluid.\" Modern medicine knows well what sunlight means to the blood.It has also discovered that chlorophyll, which is the green substance in theleaves of plants which enables them to utilise the sunlight as their source ofenergy, has a very potent influence upon the blood-pressure.65. The three Magical Images of Tiphareth are curious, for at first sight theyare so utterly unrelated that each one appears to cancel out the others. But inthe light of what we now know concerning Tiphareth, their significance andrelationship appears clearly, speaking through the language of symbolism,especially when studied in the light of the life of Jesus Christ the Son.66. Tiphareth, being the first coagulation of the Supernals, is aptlyrepresented as the new-born Child in the manger at Bethlehem; as the SacrificedGod he becomes the Mediator between God and man; and when He has risen from thedead fie is as a king come to his kingdom. Tiphareth is the child[Page 206]of Kether and the king of Malkuth, and in His own sphere lie is sacrificed.67. We shall not understand Tiphareth aright unless we have some concept of thereal meaning of sacrifice, which is very different to the popular one, whichconceives of it as the voluntary loss of something dear. Sacrifice is thetranslation of force from one form to another. There is no such thing as thetotal destruction of force; however completely it disappears from our ken, itmaintains itself in some other form according to the great natural law of theconservation of energy, which is the law that maintains our universe inexistence. Energy may be locked up in form, and therefore static; or it may befree from its bondage to form and in circulation. When we make a sacrifice ofany sort, we take a static form of energy, and by breaking up the form thatimprisons it, put it into free circulation in the cosmos. That which wesacrifice in one form turns up again in due course in another form. Apply thisconcept to the religious and ethical ideas of sacrifice and some very valuableclues are obtained.Mystical Qabala Page 14168. The God-name of this sphere is Aloah Va Daath, which associates itintimately' with the Invisible Sephirah that comes between it and Kether. ThisSephirah, as we have already seen, may best be understood as apprehension, thedawning of consciousness; and we may interpret the phrase \"Tetragrammaton AloahVa Daath\" as \"God made manifest in the sphere of mind.\"69. In the microcosm Tiphareth represents the higher psychism, the mode ofconsciousness of the individuality, Jr higher self. It is essentially the sphereof religious mysticism as distinguished from the magic and psychism of Yesod;for be it remembered, the Sephiroth of the Central Pillar of the Tree representlevels of consciousness, and the Sephiroth on the side pillars represent powersand modes of functinO. Tiphareth is also said to be the Sphere of~the GreaterMasters; it is the Temple not made with hands, eternal in the heavens and theGreat White Lodge. It is here that the initiated adept functions when in thehigher consciousness; here that he hopes to meet the Masters, and it is by meansof the Name, and by an understanding of the significance of the Name of Aloah VaDaath that he opens up the higher consciousness.70. For be it noted that it is only in proportion to the significance a word hasfor us that it becomes a Word of Power. The name of his victim is a word ofpower to a murderer; and such is its recognised potency that in some countriesan instrument to register the changes of blood-pressure is attached to the armof a suspect while he is being questioned by the police, and the name of thedead man, and other words connected with the crime, are suddenly whispered inhis ear, and if these are \"words of power\" for him, the instrument registers itbeyond all question.71. It is popularly believed that Names of Power exercise direct influence overspirits, angels, demons and such-like, but this is not so. The Name of Powerexercises its influence upon the magician, and by exalting and directingconsciousness enables him to get into touch with the chosen type of spiritualinfluence; if he has had experience of that particular type of influence, theWord of Power will stir potent subconscious memories; if he has not, andapproaches the matter in the unimaginative and incredulous spirit of thescholar, the \"barbarous Names of Evocation\" will be just hocus-pocus for him.But be it noted that to the believing Catholic, \"hocus-pocus,\" which is theProtestant's name for deception and superstition and from which is derived theword hoax, means \"Hoc est Corpus,\" which is an altogether different story. Somuch lies in the viewpoint in these matters.72. Therefore it is that a definite spiritual experience is assigned to eachSephirah, and until a person has had that experience he is not an initiate ofthat Sephirah, and cannot make use of its Names of Power even if he knows them.As tradition has it, it is not enough to know a Name of Power, one must alsoknow how to vibrate it. It is generally believed that the vibration of a Name ofPower is the right note on which to chant it; but magical vibration is somethingmuch more than that. When one is deeply moved, and at the same[Page 208]Mystical Qabala Page 142time devotionally exalted, the voice drops several tones below its normal pitchand becomes resonant and vibrant; it is this tremor of emotion combined with theresonance of devotion which constitutes the vibration of a Name, and this cannotbe learnt or taught; it can only be spontaneous. It is like the wind, it blowethwhere it listeth. When it comes, it shakes one from head to heel with a wave offiery heat, and all who hear it involuntarily come to attention. It is anextraordinary experience to hear a Word of Power vibrated. It is an even moreextraordinary experience to vibrate it.73. The archangel of Tiphareth is Raphael, the \"spirit that standeth in thesun,\" who is also the angel of healing.74. When the initiate is \"working on the Tree,\" that is to say is building up inhis imagination a diagram of the Tree of Life in his aura, he formulatesTiphareth in his solar plexus between the abdomen and the breast; if he intendsto work in the sphere of the Sixth Sephirah, and concentrates the power in thiscentre, he will find that he himself has suddenly become a spirit standing inthe sun, with the blazing photosphere all round him.It is one thing to formulate a Sephirah in one's aura; but it is quite anotherto find oneself right inside the Sephirah. Although one can receive theinfluence of a Sephirah by means of the former operation, and it is a goodroutine method for daily meditation, it is not until one has everted-as it were,turned clean inside out, so that the position is reversed, and instead of theSphere being inside one, one is inside the Sphere-that one can work with thepower of a Sephirah. it is this experience which is the culmination of theinitiation of a Sephirah.75. The Order of Angels of Tiphareth are the Malachim, or Kings. These are thespiritual principles of natural forces--and no one can control, or even safelymake contact with elemental principles unless he holds the initiation ofTiphareth, which is that of a minor adept. For he must have been accepted by theElemental Kings, that is to say he must have rcalised the ultimate spiritualnature of natural forces before he can handle them in their elemental form. Intheir subjective elemental form they appear in the microcosm as powerfulinstincts of combat, of reproduction, of self-abasement, of self-aggrandisement,and all those emotional factors known to the psychologist. It is obvious,therefore, that if we stir and stimulate these emotions in our natures it mustbe in order that we may use them as servants of the higher self, directed byreason and spiritual principle. It is necessary, therefore, that when we operatethe elemental forces we do so through the Kings, under the presidency of theArchangel and by the invocation of the Holy Name of God appropriate to thesphere. Microcosmically, this means that the powerful elemental driving-forcesof our nature are correlated with the higher self, instead of being dissociatedinto the Quphothic underworld of the Freudian unconscious.76. Elemental operations are not, of course, performed in the Sphere ofTiphareth, but it is essential that they should be controlled from the Sphere ofTiphareth if they are to remain White Magic. If there is no such higher control,they will soon slide off into Black Magic. It is said that at the Fall the fourlower Sephiroth became detached from Tiphareth and assimilated to the Quphoth.When the elemental forces become detached from their spiritual principles in ourconcepts so that they become ends in themselves, even if no Mystical Qabala Page143ev'l but merely experimentation is intended, a Fall takes place and degenerationsoon follows. But when we clearly realise the spiritual principle behind allnatural things, they are then in a state of innocence, to use a theological termwith a definite Cortnotation; they are unfallen, and we can safely work withthem and advantageously develop them in our own natures; thus bringing about theunrepression and equilibrium so necessary to mental health. This correlation ofthe natural with the spiritual, thus maintaining it unfallen and in a state ofinnocency, is a very important point in all practical workings in any form ofmagic.V77. As has already been seen, two spiritual experiences go to make up theinitiation of Tiphareth, the Vision of the Harmony[Page 210]of Things and the Vision of the Mysteries of the Crucifixion, We have alreadyseen in another connection that there are two aspects to Tiphareth, andtherefore must be two Spiritual experiences in its initiation.78. In the Vision of the Harmony of Things we see deep into the spiritual sideof Nature; in other words, we meet the Angelic Kings, the Malachim. Through thisexperience we understand that the natural is but the dense aspect of thespiritual, the \"Outer Robe of Concealment\" covering the \"Inner Robe of Glory.\"It is this understanding of the spiritual significance of the natural which isso lamentably lacking in our religious life to-day, and which is responsible forso much neurotic ill-health and so much married unhappiness.79. It is through this Vision of the Harmony of Things that we are made one withNature, not by means of elemental contacts. Human beings who are in anywiseraised by culture above the primitive cannot become one with Nature upon theelemental level, for to do so is degeneration, and they become beastly in bothsenses of the word. The nature contacts are made through the Angelic Kings ofthe Elements in the Sphere of Tiphareth-in other words, through the realisationof the spiritual principles behind natural things-and the initiate then comes tothe elemental beings in the name of their presiding King. He descends into theelemental kingdoms from above, as it were, bringing with him his manhood; thushe is an initiator to the elementals; but if he meets them on their own level,he abrogates his manhood and returns to an earlier phase of evolution. Elementalforce, not limited and kept in check by the limitations of an animal brain, isbound to be unbalanced force when it flows through the wide channels of a humanintellect, and the result is chaos, which is one of the Kingdoms of theQliphoth.80. The Mysteries of the Crucifixion are both macrocosmic and microcosmic. Intheir macrocosmic aspect we find them in the myths of the Great Redeemers ofmankind, who are always born of God and a Virgin mother, thus again emphasisingthe dual nature of Tiphareth, wherein form and force meet together. But let usnot forget their microcosmic Mystical Qabala Page 144aspect, as an experience of mystical consciousness. It is by means of anunderstanding of the Mysteries of the Crucifixion, which concern the magicalpower of sacrifice, that we are able to transcend the limitations of brainconsciousness, limited to sensation and habituated to form, and enter into thewider consciousness of the higher psychism. We thus become able to transcendform and thereby release the latent force, changing it from static to kineticand rendering it available for the Great Work, which is regeneration.81. The characteristic virtue of the Sphere of Tiphareth is Devotion to thisGreat Work.Devotion is a very important factor in the Way of Initiation that leads to thehigher consciousness, and we must therefore examine it carefully and analyse itinto the factors of which it consists. Devotion might be defined as love forsomething higher than ourselves; something that evokes our idealism; which,while we despair of becoming equal to it, yet makes us aspire to become like it;\"Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same imagefrom glory to glory.\" When a stronger emotional content is infused into devotionand it becomes adoration, it carries us across the great gulf fixed between thetangible and the intangible, and enables us to apprehend things that eye hathnot seen, nor ear heard. It is this Devotion, rising to Adoration, in the GreatWork, which initiates us into the Mysteries of the Crucifixion.82. The Vice assigned to Tiphareth is Pride, and in this attribution we havesome very true psychology. Pride has its roots in egoism, and as long as we areself-centred we Cannot be made one with all things. In the true selflessness ofthe Path the soul overflows its boundaries and enters into all things throughlimitless sympathy and perfect love; but in pride the soul tries to extend itsboundaries till it possesses all things, and it is a very different matter topossess a thing to being made one with it, wherein it equally possesses us inPerfect reciprocity. It is this one-sided arrangement which[Page 212]is the vice of the adept. He must give as well as receive, and he must givehimself unreservedly if he would participate in mystical union, which is thefruit of the sacrifice of crucifixion. \"Let him who would be the greatest amongyou be the servant of all,\" said Our Lord.83. The symbols associated with Tiphareth are the lamen; the Rosy Cross; theCalvary Cross; the truncated pyramid; and the cube.84. The lamen is the symbol upon the breast of the adept and indicates the forcehe represents. An adept performing work in the Sphere of Shemesh, for instance,would wear upon his breast an image of the sun in splendour. A lamen is themagical weapon of Tiphareth; and it therefore becomes necessary to say somethingconcerning the nature of magical weapons in general in order that the functionof a lamen can be understood.85. A magical weapon is some object which is found to be suitable as a vehiclefor force of a particular type. For instance, the magical weapon of the Elementof Water is a cup or chalice; the magical weapon of the Element of Fire is alighted lamp. These objects are Mystical Qabala Page 145chosen because their nature is congenial to that of the force to be invoked; orin modern language, because their form suggests the force to the imagination byassociation of ideas.86. Tiphareth is traditionally associated with the breast, both by virtue of thenetwork of nerves which is called the solar plexus, and by its position when theTree is built up in the aura. Consequently the breast jewel of the adept is heldto be the focus of the Tipharic force, whatever operation may be performed. Theactual force, operating in its own sphere, is represented by the magical weaponassigned to it. For instance, an adept performing an operation of the Element ofWater would have as his magical weapon the Cup, and with the Cup would make allsigns, and upon the Cup would concentrate the force called down by invocation.But upon his breast would be the sigil of the Element of Water, and this wouldbe recognised as representing the spiritual factor in the operation, and asreferring to the archangel over that particular kingdom. Unless the adeptunderstands the significance of his lamen, as distinguished from his magicalweapon, he is no adept, but a wizard.87. The Rosy Cross and the Calvary Cross are both given as symbols of the Sphereof Tiphareth. In order to understand their significance, it is necessary to saysomething concerning crosses in general, and how they are used in systemsofsymbol-ism. Although the cross with which we are most generally familiar isthe Calvary Cross, Owing to its association with Christianity, there are manyother forms of cross, and each has its own significance. The Equal-armed Cross,such as the Red Cross of the army medical service, is called by initiates theCross of Nature, and represents power in equilibrium. It is to be found at thetop of some Keltic crosses, often enclosed in a circle, so that a Keltic crossactually consists of a tapering shaft ending in a nature cross, and has norelationship whatever to the Calvary Cross, which is the Cross of Christianity.The tapering shaft of the Keltic cross is, in actual fact, a truncated pyramid,and examples of this type of Keltic cross exist which leave no doubt upon thispoint whatsoever. Some archaic forms suggest the imposition of the cross andcircle upon the conical phallic stone which is so universal an object inprimitive worship.88. The Swastika is also a nature cross, and is sometimes called the Cross ofThor, or the Hammer of Thor, its form being supposed to indicate the whirlingaction of his thunderbolts.89 The Calvary Cross is the Cross of Sacrifice, and should Ptoperly be colouredblack. Its shaft should be three times the length of its arms, and the length ofeach arm three times its width. Meditation on this cross brings initiationthrough suffering, sacrifice, and self-abnegation. The Crucifix is, of course,an elaboration of the Calvary Cross.90. The circle upon the cross is an initiatory symbol, especially when the crossis raised upon three steps, as it should be in this form. The circle indicateseternal life; also wisdom;[Page 214]Mystical Qabala Page 146and we see a form of it in the emblem of the Theosophical Society, which has forits badge the \"serpent that holdeth his tail in his mouth.\" A Calvary Cross withthe circle Super imposed means initiation by the Way of the Cross, and the threesteps are the three degrees of illumination. It is this which is the so-calledRosy Cross. The fanciful oblect with brambles growing over it is not aninitiatory symbol at all. The Rose associated with the Cross in Westernsymbolism is the Rosa Mundi, and is a key to the interpretation of the natureforces. On its petals are marked the thirty-two signs of the natural forces;these correspond to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the TenHoly Sephi roth; these in their turn are assigned to the Thirty-two Paths of theTree of Life, and this is the key to the understanding of the Rosa Mundi. Thecurious scribbles that are called the sigils of the elementary spirits are madeby drawing lines from one to another of the letters of their names on the Rose.91. In the light of this exp]anation we are at no loss to understand the valueof the claims of those organisations which sport a floral emblem as theirsymbol. They are on a par with those of the gentleman who demanded of hishaberdasher a Public School tie with a bit of red in it.92. The cube is usually said to be assigned to Tiphareth because it is asix-sided figure, and six is the number of Tiphareth. But there is more thanthis in the symbolism of the cube. The cube is the simplest form of solid, andas such is the appropriate symbol of Tiphareth, in whose sphere is found thefirst foreshadowing of form. The symbol of Malkuth is the double cube, whichsymbolises \"As above, so below.\"93. The pyramid symbolises the perfected man, broad-based on earth and taperingto unity in the heavens; in other words, the Ipsissimus. The truncated pyramidsymbolises the initiated adept, or Adeptus Minor, who has passed within the Veilbut has not yet completed his grades. This pyramid, to whose six sidescorrespond the six central Sephiroth which constitute Adam Kadmon, or theArchetypal Man, is completed by the addition of the Three Supernals whichterminate in the unity of Kether.94 The Sixes of the Tarot suits are also assigned to Tiphareth, and in them theharmonious and balanced nature of this Sepbirah shows clearly. The Six of Wandsis the Lord of Victory. The Six of Cups, the Lord of Joy. Even the maleficentSuit of Swords is tuned to harmony in this sphere, and the Six of Swords isknown as the Lord of Earned Success - that is to say, success achieved afterstruggle. The Six of Pentacles is Material Success; in other words, power inequilibrium.PART IIICHAPTER XXITHE FOUR LOWER SEPHIROTHMystical Qabala Page 1471. The Ten Holy Sephiroth, when arranged upon the Tree of Life in theirtraditional pattern, fall into three main horizontal divisions, as well as thethree vertical divisions of the Pillars. The highest of these horizontaldivisions consists of the Three Supernals, which for all practical purposes arebeyond the sphere of our comprehension. We posit them as fundamental principleswhich must exist if subsequent manifestations are to be explained. Theyrepresent Pure Being and the opposing principles of Activity and Passivity, andthey are well described by calling them the Supernal Triangle.2. The next functional triangle upon the Tree consists of Chesed, Geburah, andTiphareth.These represent the active principles of Anabolism, Katabolism, and Equilibrium,and might best be described by calling them the Abstract Triangle.3. All these six higher Sephiroth we have considered in detail, and we have seenhow the three Supernal principles form the basis of manifestation, and the threeAbstract principles give expression to manifestation. The three higher arelatent, and the three lower are potent. If we understand these things, we findwe have a system for explaining the infinite diversity of manifestation of theplanes of form by reducing them to their primary principles, which renders therelations between them and the mode of their interaction and development clearlycomprehensible; which it never has been, and never can be when the attempt ismade to reduce all things to terms of form, instead of resolving them into termsof force.4. The lowest functional unit on the Tree of Life consists,[Page 216]not of a triangle, but of a quaternary, and this quaternary is said by theQabalists to have been affected by the Fall, the head of Leviathan rising out ofihe Abyss to a point between Yesod and Tiphareth. Beyond this it was notpermitted to go, and the six higher Sephiroth retained their innocency. In otherwords, the four lower Sephiroth belong to the planes of form, wherein force isno longer free-moving, but \"cabined, cribbed, confined\"; only to be freed byworks of destruction.5. Tiphareth, as has already been seen, is the centre of equilibrium of theTree.Equilibrium gives rise to stability, and stability to cohesion. From now onwardsin the descent of life upon the Path of Involution we find the principle ofcohesion playing an increasingly predominant part, until in Malkuth it reachesits apogee.6. We may well conceive that the active principles of the Abstract Triangleunderwent subdivision and specialisation in the course of the descent of lifethrough Netzach, and in Yesod attained to a considerable degree of stereotypingby means of which the forms of Malkuth were determined. Once Malkuth, which isthe plane of pure form, attained development, the evolutionary stream began toturn back towards spirit, freeing itself from the bondage of form whileretaining the capacities acquired by experience of the discipline of form.Mystical Qabala Page 1487. We may conceive, then, of numerous abstract principles of life-functionbecoming clothed upon with form owing to the influence of the experience oftheir outward manifestations in the Kingdom of Form. Or, in the language of theQabalists, the influence of the Fall is felt by them, and they have lost theirinnocency.8. These considerations give us an insight into the nature of the Quaternary ofthe Planes of Form, and enable us to tread the Middle Way between credulity andscepticism in this Sphere of Illusion, as it has somewhat unkindly been called.9. The great tide of evolving life, which issued as an emanation from Tiphareth,is broken up in the Sephirab Netzach as by a prism into many-rayedmanifestation; whence comes the[Page 218]Yetziratic description of this Sephirah as \"the refulgent splendour.\" In Hodthese multifarious forces are clothed upon with form; and in Yesod they act asetheric moulds for the final emanations in Malkuth.10. Manifestation in Malkuth completes the outgoing arc of involution, and lifeturns back npon itself to pursue a parallel course on the returning arc ofevolution. Human intelligence develops, and begins to meditate upon causationand discerns the gods. Be it noted that primitive man has never achievedmonotheism in a single stride; he has alwavs conceived of causation as multiformand it has required many generations of culture to reduce the many to the One.11. This brings us to the great question, which might almost be called theDweller on the Threshold of occult science, the horror which confronts everyadventurer into the Unseen which unites in itself the functions of the Sphinx,and asks a question of the soul upon the answer to which hangs his fate. Shallhe be condemned to wander in the realms of illusion? Shall he be turned back onto the planes of form, or shall he he permitted to pass on into the Light? Thisquestion is, Do you believe in the gods? If he answers Yes, he will he awanderer in the planes of illusion, for the gods are not real persons as weunderstand personality. If he answers No, he will be rurned back at the gate,for the gods are not illusions. What then shall he answer?12. The intuition of a poet has given us the answer.\"For no thought of man made Gods to love and honour Ere the song within thesilent soul began, Nor might earth in dream or deed take heaven upon her Tillthe word was clothed with speech by lips of man.\"13. Therein we have the clue to the riddle. The gods are the creations of thecreated. They are made by the adoration of their worshippers. It is not the godsthat do the vork of creation. This is done by the great natural forces workingeach according to its nature; the gods come in their processiOfl after the Swanof the Empyrean has laid the egg of rnaul festation in the darkness of thecosmic night.Mystical Qabala Page 14914. The gods are emanations of the group-minds of races; they are not emanationsof Eheieh, the One and Eternal. Nevertheless, they are immensely powerful,because by means of their influence over the imaginations of their worshippersthey link the microcosm with the macrocosm; for by meditation on the idealbeauty of Apollo the soul of man is opened to beauty in general.15. As man has analysed life and discerned factor by factor its prime motives,he has apotheosised them. Because man in all parts of the globe has found thatthe same needs and motives actuate him, he has evolved comparable pantheons.Because temperaments differ, he has evolved as different pantheons as theblood-thirsty fiends of Mexico and the radiant beings of Hellas.16. We may ask ourselves, then, whether the gods are whole subjective; whetherthey live solely in the imaginations of their worshippers, or whether they havean independent life of their own? The answer to this question is to be found ina fact of occult experience which cannot be explained by what we know of naturalscience, but which has to be taken for granted by every practical occultistbefore he can obtain results. In fact, one might say that the results he obtainsare in proportion to his faith, for it becomes true for him as soon as hebelieves in it. This fact is, that only a very small pro-portion of the existingmind-stuff of the universe whatever that may be, is organised into the brainsand nervous systems of Sentient creatures. The vast mass of what, for want of abetter name, we call mind-stuff, because that is its nearest analogy among knownthings, is free-moving upon what occultists call the astral plane, organisedinto forms within itself, but not necessarily attached to matter. Differentoccultists refer to this free mind-stuff by different names. Mme Blavatsky callsit Akasha; Eliphas Levi calls it the reflecting ether.Netzach represents the force aspect, and Hod the form aspect of this Akasha.17. Out of this mind-stuff are formed the moulds of all forms; and within thesemoulds are built up the framework of[Page 220]etheric stresses that function in the sphere of Yesod, and within which are heldthe molecules of matter which form the body of manifestation on the physicalplane.18. Normally these forms are built by the cosmic consciousness expressed asnatural forces, functioning each according to its nature; but as consciousnessbegan to develop in the creatures of the Creator, it exercised its function invarying degrees upon the astral mind-stuff which, by its nature, was amenable tothe influences of consciousness; consequently, \"the thought of man made Gods tolove and honour.\" These forms, once built, became channels of the specialisedforces they were designed to represent, concentrating them upon theirworshippers. In this enlightened sense initiates not only believe in, but adorethe gods.CHAPTER XXIIMystical Qabala Page 150NETZACHTITLE: Netzach, Victory. (Hebrew spelling: Nun, Tzaddi, Cheth.)

Netzach, the Sphere of Venus, is best understood by contrasting it with Hod,the Sphere of Mercury, these two repre-senting force and form on a lower arc, ashas already been seen. Netzach represents the instincts and the emotions theygive[Page 222]rise to, and Hod represents the concrete mind. In the macro cosm they representtwo levels of the process of the con cretion of force into form. In Netzachforce is still relatively free-moving, being bound only into exceedingly fluidicand ever-shifting shapes, and in Hod taking on for the first time definite andpermanent form, though of an exceedingly tenuous nature. In Netzach a particularform of force represents itself as a type of beings, flowing backwards andforwards over the boundaries of manifestation in an exceedingly elusive manner.Such beings have no individualised personalities, but are like the armies withbanners that can be seen in the sunset clouds. In Hod, however,individualisation into units has taken place, and there is continuity ofexistence. All mind is group-mind in Netzach, but in Hod the human mind has itsbeginnings.2. Let us now consider Netzach itself, both in its microcosmic and macrocosmicaspects, bearing constantly in mind that we are now in the sphere of illusion,and that what is about to be described in terms of form are appearances asrepresented by the intellect to itself and projected back into the astral lightas thought-forms. This is a very important point, and should be thoroughlyunderstood in order to avoid falling into superstition.Everything that is perceived by the \"eyes of the intellect and thecontemplations of faith,\"as the Yetziratic Text so graphically puts it, has its metaphysical basis inChokmah, the Supernal Sephirah at the head of the Pillar of Mercy. But withNetzach a great change comes over our mode of apprehending the different typesof existence assigned to each sphere. Hitherto we have perceived by means ofintuition; our apprehensions have been formless, or at least represented byhighly abstract symbols; there are no more of these after Tiphareth, but we cometo such concrete symbols as the rose, assigned to Venus, for Netzach, and thecaduceus, assigned to Mercury, for Hod.3. As has been seen, we conceive of the higher Sephiroth under the aspect offactors of martifestation and functionS. We saw in our study of Tiphareth howthe Mediating Intelligence, as the Sepher Yetzirah calls it, broke up the WhiteLight of the One Life as in a prism so that it becomes the Refulgent Splendourof many-rayed hues in Netzach.Here we have not force, but forces; not life, but lives. Appropriately,therefore, the Order of Angels assigned to Netzach are the Flohim, or gods. TheOne has been reduced to the Many for the purposes of manifestation in form.4. These rays are not represented as the pure white light by which we seeeverything in its true colours, but as many-hued, each one of which brings outand intensifies some specialised aspect of manifestation, just as a ray of bluelight will only show up those colours that are sympathetic to it, and will makeits complementary colours look black.Every life or form of force manifesting in Netzach is a partial but specialisedmanifestation; therefore no being that has for its sphere of evolution thesphere of Mystical Qabala Page 152Netzach can ever have an all-round development, but must always be a creature ofone idea, one single, simple, stereotyped function.5. It is the Netzach factor in ourselves that is the basis of our instincts,each of which, in their unintellectualised essence, gives rises to appropriatereflexes, just as an infant's lips will suck anything that is inserted betweenthem.6. The beings of Netzach, the Elohim, are not so much intelligences as theembodiments of ideas.7. These Elohim, to give them their Hebrew name, are the formative influenceswhereby the creative force expresses itself in Nature. Their true character isto be discerned in Chesed, where they are described by the Sepher Yetzirah asthe Holy Powers.\" In Netzach, however, which represents the upper stratum of thereflecting ether, they undergo a change, the image-making mind of man has begunto work upon them, moulding the astral light into forms that shall representthem to his consciousness.8. It is very important that we should realise that these lower Sephiroth of thePlane of Illusion are densely populated by thought-forms; that everything whichthe human imagination has been able to conceive, however dimly, has a form built[Page 224]about it out of the astral light, and that the more the human imagination hasdwelt upon it to idealise it, the more definite that form becomes. Consequently,subsequent generations of seers, when they seek to discern the spiritual natureand inner most essence of any form of life, are met by these images, thecreations of the created,\" and will be deceived therehy, mistaking them for theabstract essence itself, which is not to be found upon any plane that yieldsimages to psychic vision, but only upon those that are discerned by pureintuition.9. When his mentality was still primitive man worshipped these images, by meansof which he represented to himself the great natural forces so all-important tohis material well~heing, thus establishing a link with them, by means of which achannel was developed whereby the forces they represented were poured into hissoul, thus stimulating the corresponding factor in his own nature and therebydeveloping it. The operations of this worship, especially when it became highlyorganised and intellectualised, as in Greece and Egypt, built up exceedinglydefinite and potent images, and it is these that are generally understood as thegods. Generations of worship and adoration kuild a very strong image in theastral light, and when sacrifice is added to worship, the image is brought astep farther down the planes into manifestation and acquires a form in theder:se ethers of Yesod, and is a very potent magical object, capable ofindependent action when ensouled by the concrete ideas generated in Hod.10. We see, then, that every celestial being conceived by the mind of man has asits basis a natural force, but that upon the basis of this natural force isbuilt up a symbolic image Mystical Qabala Page 153representative thereof, which is ensouled and rendered active by the force itrepresents.The image, then, is but a mode of representation indulged in by the human mindfor its own convenience, but the force that the image represents, and whichensouls it, is a very real thing indeed, and under certain circumstances can beexceedingly powerful. In other words, although the form under which the god isrepresented is pure imagination, the force associated with it is both real andactive.11. This fact is the key, not only to talismanic magic in its broadest sense,which includes all consecrated objects used in ceremonial and for meditation,but to many things in life that we cannot fail to observe but forwhichwe have noexplanation. It explains a great many things in organised religion that are veryreal to the believer but very baffling to the unbeliever, who can neitherexplain them nor explain them away.12. In Netzach, however, we have the most tenuous form of these things, and theyare perceived far more by the \"contemplations of faith\" than by the \"eyes of theintellect.\" In the Sphere of Hod are performed all manner of magical operationsin which the intellect itself is brought to bear upon these tenuous and fleetingimages to give them form and permanency; but in the Sphere of Netzach suchoperations do not take place to any great degree; all god-forms in Netzach areworshipped by means of the arts, not conceived by means of philosophies.Nevertheless, for all practical purposes it is impossible to separate theactivities of Hod and Netzach, which are a functional pair, just as Geburah andChesed make up the two aspects of metabolism, the katabolic and the anabolic.The functions of Netzach are implicit in Hod because Netzach emanates Hod, andthe powers developed by evolution in the Sphere of Netzach are the basis of thecapacities of Hod.Consequently all magical operations of the Sphere of Hod work upon a basis ofthe tenuous life-forms of Netzach; and because the human intellect works up fromSphere to Sphere, a good deal of the powers of Hod have been carried over intoNetzach by initiated souls going on ahead of evolution. The two Spheres,therefore, are not clear-cut in their division and classification, but in eachone a certain type of function very definitely predominates.13. The contacts of Netzach are not made by means of conceiving its lifephilosophically, nor by means of ordinary image-making psychism, but by \"feelingwith,\" as Algernon Blackwood has so graphically expressed it in his novels, into[Page 226]which so much of the Sphere of Netzach enters. It is by means of dance and soundand colour that the Netzach angels are contacted and evoked. The worshipper of agod in the Sphere of Netzach enters into communion with the object of hisadoration by means of the arts; and in proportion as he is an artist in somemedium or other, and can therein represent his deity symbolically, will he beable to make the contact and draw the life into himself. All rites which haverhythm and movement and colour in them are aworking in the Sphere of Netzach.And as Hod, the Sphere of magical workings, draws its force from Netzach, itfollows that any magical operation of the Sphere of Hod must have a Netzachelement in it if it is to be ensouled effectually; and in order to provide abasis of Mystical Qabala Page 154manifestation, etheric substance has to be provided by some form of sacrifice,even if it he only the burning of incense. This question will be dealt withfully in studying the Sphere of Yesod, to which it belongs. It is necessary torefer to it here, because the significance of the rites of Netzach cannot beunderstood without a realisation of the means whereby manifestation is effected,and the god brought near to his worshippers.II14. Let us now consider Netzach from the point of view of the microcosmic Treeof Life-that is to say, the subjective Tree within the soul, wherein theSephiroth are factors in consciousness.15. The Three Supernals, and the first pair of manifesting Sephiroth, Chesed andGeburah, represent the Higher Self, with Tiphareth as the point of contact withthe Lower Self. The four lower Sephiroth, Netzach, Hod, Yesod, and Malkuth,represent the Lower Self, or personality, the unit of incarnation, withTiphareth as the point of contact with tne Higher Self, which is sometimescalled the Holy Guardian Angel.16. From the point of view of the personality, Tiphareth represents the higherconsciousness, aware of spiritual things; Netzach represents the instincts, andHod the intellect. Yesod represents the fifth element, Kether, and Malkuth thefour elenients which are the subtle aspect of matter. All that the average humanintellect can realise is the nature of dense niatter, Malkuth, and of theintellect, Hod, both concrete aspects of existence. It has no appreciation ofthe forces which build the forms, as represented by Netzach, the Sphere of theinstincts, and Yesod, the etheric double or subtle body.consequently we must make a careful study of Netzach because its nature andimportance are so little understood.17. We shall comprehend the nature of Netzach in the microcosm best if weremember that it is the Sphere of Venus, with all that that implies. Translatedfrom the symbolic language of the Qabalah into plain English, it means that weare concerned here with the function of polarity, which is a very great dealmore than mere sex as popularly conceived.18. It is important to note in this respect that Venus, or in her Greek form,Aphrodite, is not a fertility goddess at all, such as are Ceres and Persephone;she is the goddess of love.Now in the Greek concept of life, Love embraced much more than the relationshipbetween the sexes, it included the comr'deship of fighting men and therelationship of teacher and pupil. The Greek hetaira, or woman whose professionis love, was something very different to our modern prostitute. The Greek keptthe simple physical relation of the sexes for his lawful wife, who was secludedin the gynieceum, or harem, and was kept simply for breeding purposes in orderthat he might have lawful heirs; and she was a woman without education though ofgood blood, and was not encouraged to render herself attractive or ply the artsof love. Still less was she encouraged to worship the Mystical Qabala Page 155goddess Aphrodite, who presides over the higher aspects of love; the deities ofher adoration were expected to be the gods of hearth and home; Ceres theearth-mother was the ruler of the Mysteries of the Greek women.19. The Aphrodite cult was something very much more than the simple performanceof an animal function. It was concerned with the subtle interaction of thelife-force between[Page 228]two factors; the curious flow and return, the stimulus and the reaction, whichplays so important a part in the relations of the sexes, but extends far beyondthe sphere of sex.20. The Greek hetaira was expected to be a woman of culture; there were, ofcourse, all grades among them, {? £i'o~} the lower, who approximated to theJapanese geisha, to the higher, who held salons after the manner of the famousFrench blue-stockings, and were women of clean physical virtue to whom no manwould dare to make sensual advances; but because of the reverence in which thefunction of sex was held among the Greeks, it is probable that at no grade ofsociety did the hetaira approximate to the degradation of the modernprofessional prostitute.21. The function of the hetaira was to minister to the intellect of her clientsas well as their appetites; she was a hostess as well as a mistress, and to herresorted the philosophers and poets to receive inspiration and sharpen theirwits; for it was well realised that there is no greater inspiration to anintellectual man than the society of a vital and cultured woman.22. In the temples of Aphrodite the art of love was sedulously cultivated, andthe priestesses were trained from childhood in its skill. But this art was notsimply that of provoking passion, but of adequately satisfying it on all levelsof consciousness; not simply by the gratification of the physical sensations ofthe body, but by the subtle etheric exchange of magnetism and intellectual andspiritual polarisation. This lifted the cult nf Aphrodite out of the sphere ofsimple sensuality, and explains why the priestesses of the cult commandedrespect and were by no means looked upon as common prostitutes, although theyreceived all comers. They were engaged in ministering to certain of the subtlerneeds of the human soul by means of their skilled arts. We have brought to ahigher pitch of development than was ever known to the Greeks the art ofstimulating desire with film and revue and syncopation, but we have no knowledgeof the far more important art of meeting the needs of the human soul for ethericand mental interchange of magnetism, and it is for this reason that our sexlife, both physiologically and socially, is so unstable and unsatisfactory.23. We cannot understand sex aright unless we realise that it is one aspect ofwhat the esotericist calls polarity, and that this is a principle that runsthrough the whole of creation, and is, in fact, the basis of manifestation. Itis represented on the Tree by the two Pillars of Severity and Mercy. The wholeof the activity of force is comprised in the Mystical Qabala Page 156principle of polarity, just as the whole of the function of form is comprised inthe principle of metabolism.24. Polarity really means the flowing of force from a sphere of high pressure toa sphere of low pressure; high and low being always relative terms. Every sphereof energy needs to receive the stimulus of an influx of energy at higherpressure, and to have an output into a sphere of lower pressure. The source ofall energy is in the Great Unmanifest, and it makes its way down the levels,changing its form from one to the other, till it is finally\"earthed\" in Malkuth. In every individual life, in every form of activity, inevery organised social group for whatever purpose, whether army, church, orlimited company, we see the exemplification of this flowing of energy incircuit. The great point we need to realise is that in the microcosmic Treethere is a flow down and up the positive and negative aspects of our ownsubjective levels of consciousness, whereby the spirit inspires mind, and minddirects the emotions, and the emotions form the etheric double, and the ethericdouble inoulds the physical vehicle, which is the \"earth\" of the circuit.This is a fact that is generally realised, and its implications are easily seenas soon as attention is drawn to them.25. But a point we do not so readily realise is that there is a 'flow and returnbetween each\"body\" or level of consciousness and its corresponding aspect in the macrocosm.Just as there is an intake and output on the level of Malkuth whereby food andwater are received into the body as nutriment and rejected as excreta, which isthe food of the vegetable kingdom under the polite name of manure-so is there anintake and output between the etheric double and the astral light, and[Page 230]between the astral body and the mind side of nature, and 50 on up the planes,with the subtler factors represented by the Six higher Sephiroth. The essence ofthe Magical Qabalah, which is the practical application of the Tree of Life, isto develop these magnetic circuits of the different levels) and so strengthenand reinforce the soul. Just as the physical body is nourished by eating anddrinking, and kept healthy by adequate excretion, which might be called theoperations of the Sphere of Malkuth, so is the soul of man energised by theoperations of the Sphere of Tiphareth, which is also called the Sphere of theRedeemer, who brings health to the soul. We know how initiation develops thepowers of the higher psychism and enables the human understanding to apprehendspiritual truths; what we do not realise is that for the full gamut of humandevelopment we need also to develop our power to contact natural energy in itsessential form as represented by the Sphere of Netzach. We are accustomed totake the line that the spiritual and the natural are mutually antagonistic andthat we must rob Peter to pay Paul, and to conclude that if the spiritual is thehighest good, the natural must necessarily be the lowest evil; we do not realisethat matter is crystallised spirit, and spirit is volatilised matter, and thatthere is no difference of substance between them, any more than there is betweenwater and ice, but both are different states of the One Thing, as the alchemistscall it; this is the great secret of alchemy which forms the philosophic basisof the secret doctrine of transmutation."},{"pageContent":"Mystical Qabala Page 15726. But the transmutation of metals is of little save academic importancecompared to the transmutation of energy within the soul. It is this that theinitiates deal with by means of the technique of the Tree of Life; and asconsciousness transmutes up and down the Central Pillar of Mildness, orEquilibrium, so does energy transmute up and down the Pillar of Mercy, of whichNetzach is the base, and form transmute up and down the Pillar of Severity, ofwhich Hod, the intellect, is the base.27. In Chokmah, then, we get the tremendous drive of lile, which is the greatmale potency of the universe; in Chesed we get the organisation of forces intointeracting wholes; and inNetzach we get a sphere wherein evolution, ascending from Malkuth as organisedforce ensouling vivified form, is able to contact essential force once more.Netzach, the Sphere of Nogah, which is the Hebrew name for Venus-Aphrodite, istherefore an exceedingly important Sphere from the point of view of thepractical work of occultism. It is because most people who go in for occultismwork up the Central Pillar only, which is the Pillar of Consciousness, and payno attention to the side pillars, which are the Pillars of Function, that suchnegligible results are obtained from initiation. The blind are leading theblind, and the average would-be initiator in modern occult fraternities, who isusually more of a mystic than an occultist, does not realise that he has got toinitiate subconsciousness as well as consciousness, and illuminate the instinctsas well as the reason.III28. We have considered Netzach from the objective and the subjective points ofview; it now remains to study the symbolism assigned to this Sephirah in thelight of the knowledge we have already obtained.29. We shall observe at once that the symbolism contains two distinct ideas-theidea of power and the idea of beauty; and we are reminded of the love thatexisted between Venus and Mars according to the old myth. Now these myths arenot fabulous, save in the historical sense, but represent truths of the spirit;and when we find the same idea recurring in different pantheons, when we findHebrew Qabalist and Greek poet, whose mentalities were as far removed from eachother as the poles, presenting the same concept in different forms, we mustconclude that it is not accidental, but will repay careful scrutiny.30. Let us depart from our usual method of analysing the symbols in the givenorder, and classify them according to the two types into which they fall.31. The Hebrew title of the Seventh Sep hi rah is Netzach, rneaning Victory. Itsadditional title is Firmness, which[Page 232]Mystical Qabala Page 158carries out the same idea of masterful and victorious energy.The God-name is Jehovah Tzabaoth, meaning the Lord of Hosts, or God of Armies.The Order of Angels assigned to Netzach are the Elohim, or gods, the rulers ofNature.32. The four Tarot cards assigned to this Sephirab all contain the idea ofbattle, even if in a negative form. It is curious to note, however, that it isonly the Seven of Wands which has a good, or positive, significance, the otherthree Sevens are all cards of ill fortune.The reason for this becomes clear) however) when we understand the symbolism asa whole, so we will put it aside for the moment, and reconsider it later.33. Let us now turn to the consideration of the other set of symbolic images.The Mundane Chakra of Netzach is the planet Venus, and the magical image is,appropriately enough, \"a beautiful naked woman.\" The spiritual experienceassigned to this sphere is the Vision of Beauty Triumphant. The virtue isUnselfishness-that is to say, the capacity to polarise from the negative pole.The vices are the obvious ones of love abused-unchastity and lust.34. The correspondence in the microcosm is with the loins, hips, and legs.These, it will be noted, form the setting of the generative organs, but not thegenerative organs themselves, and bear out the idea previously shadowed forth,that the goddess of Love and the fertility goddess are not one and the samething.35. The symbols assigned to Netzach are the Lamp, the Girdle, and the Rose. TheGirdle and Rose are self-explanatory, for they are traditionally associated withVenus. The Lamp, however, requires more explanation, for the classicalassociations afford us no clue on this point. We must turn to alchemy.36. The four Elements are associated with the four lower Sephiroth, and of thesethe Element of Fire is associated withNetzach. The Lamp is the magical weapon used in operations of the Element ofFire.Hence the association with Netzach.The Element of Fire is associated with the fiery energy at the heart of Nature,and connects up with the Mars aspect of the Venus Sephirah.37. We see, then, from a study of the foregoing symbolism, that the Mars, orVictory, symbolism is associated with the Macrocosm, and the Venus, or Love,symbolism with the Microcosmic or subjective aspect. This gives us the key to avery important psychological truth, well understood by the ancients, but whichhad to await the work of Freud for its interpretation in modern language. Thismay best be expressed by saying that elemental energy, or the fundamentaldynamism of an individual, is very closely connected with the sex life of thatindividual.38. This is a very important fact in our psychic life, well understood bypsychologists though but little appreciated by mystics and psychics, whogenerally incline to an idealism which seeks to escape from matter and itsproblems. But to escape like this is to leave unconquered fortresses in ourrear; and the wiser way, the only way that can Mystical Qabala Page 159produce wholeness of life and a balanced temperament, is to give due place toNetzach, which balances the intellectuality of Hod and the materiality ofMalkuth, remembering always that the Tree consists of the two Pillars ofPolarity and the Path of Equilibrium between them.39. The true secret of natural goodness lies in the recognition o~ thecontending rights of the Pairs of Opposites; there is no such antinomy asbetween Good and Evil, but only the balance between two extremes, each of whichis evil when carried to excess, both of which give rise to evil if insufficientfor equipoise. Unb~dled licence leads to degradation; but unbalanced idealismleads to psychopathology.40. There are three types of persons who pass within the Veil - the mystic, thepsychic, and the occultist. The mystic aspires to union with God, and achieveshis end by putting aside all that is not of God in his life. The psychic is areceiver of subtle vibrations, but not a transmitter. The occultist must needsbe to some extent at least a receiver, but his primary aim is to be able tocontrol and direct in the[Page 234]invisible kingdoms in the same way that the man of science has learnt to controland direct in the kingdom of Nature.41. Tn order to achieve this end he must work in harmonv with thc invisibleforces in the same way that the scientist masters Nature by understanding her.Of these invisible forces some are spiritual, descending from Kether, and Someare elemental, working up from Malkuth. The Kether forces of the Macrocosm arepicked up by the Tiphareth-centre in the Microcosm, to use the Qabalisticterminology; the elemental forces are picked up by the Yesod-centre, but-andthis is the important point-they are directed and controlled by the manner inwhich the equilibrium is maintained between Netzach and Hod.42. Netzach, in the Microcosm, represents the instinctive, emotional side of ournature, and Hod represents the intellect; Netzach is the artist in us, and Hodis the scientist.According as our moods shift between restraint and dynamism will he the polarityof Hod and Netzach in the Microcosm which is the soul. If there is no Netzachinfluence to introduce a dynamic element, the over-preponderance of Hod willlead to all theory and no practice in occult matters. No one can handle magic inwhom the Sphere of Netzach is not in function, for the scepticism of Hod willkill all magical images before their birth.Like all things in nature, Hod, unfertilised by its opposing polarity, issterile. There must be something of the artist in every occultist who wants todo practical work. The intellect alone, however powerful) does not conferpowers. It is through the Netzach in our own nature that the elemental forcesobtain access to consciousness; without Netzach, they remain in the subconsciousSphere of Yesod, working blindly. It is taught in the Mysteries that each levelof manifestation has its own ethic, or standard of right and wrong, and that wemust not confuse the planes by expecting from one the standard ot another, whichis not applicable thereon. In the realm ot mind, the ethic is Truth; on theastral plane, which is the sphere of the emotions and instincts, the ethic isBeauty. We Mystical Qabala Page 160must learn to understand the righteousness of Beauty, as well as the beauty ofrighteousness, if we want to bring all the provinces of the inner kingdom intoobedience to the central power of unified consciousness.43. In entering upon the region of the four lower Sephiroth we are coming intothe sphere of the human mind. Subjectively considered, they constitute thepersonality and its powers. It is the aim of occult initiation to develop thesepowers and, if taken from the higher standpoint, as it always should be if it isnot to degenerate into black magic, to unite them with Tiphareth, which is thefocussing-point of the higher self, or Individuality. In discussing Netzach,therefore, we have definitely passed within the portal of the Mysteries, and aretreading upon the sacred ground reserved for initiates.44. I am no advocate of a secrecy which is s~mply priest-craft, but there arecertain practical secrets of the Mysteries which it is inadvisable to cry aloudlest they be abused.There is also the inveterate tendency of human nature to apply its owndefinitions to familiar terms, and to refuse to recognise them apart from theirfamiliar associations. If I lift a corner of the Veil of the Temple and revealthe fact that sex is simply a special instance of the universal principle ofpolarity, the immediate assumption is that polarity and sex are synonymousterms. If I say that although sex is a part of polarity, there is a great dealof polarity that has nothing to do with sex, my explanation is ignored. PerhapsI shall be understood better if I substitute the terminology of physics for thatof the more appropriate psychology, and say that life will only flow in circuit;insulate it, and it becomes inert. Let us take the human personality as anelectrical machine; it must be connected up with the power-house, which is God,the Source of all Life, or there will be no motive power; but equally it must be\"earthed,\" or the power will not flow. Every human being must be \"earthed\" tothe earth, both literally and metaphorically. The idealist tries to induce acomplete insulation of all earth-contacts in order that the inflowing power maynot be wasted; he fails to realise that the earth is one great magnet.45 Tradition declares from of old that the key to the[Page 236]Mysteries was written upon the Emerald Tablet of Hermes, whereon were inscribedthe words, \"As above, so below.\" Apply the principles of physics to psychology,and the riddle will be read. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.46. Finally we come to the consideration of the signiflcanc~ of the Tarot cardsassociated with Netzach. These are the four Sevens of the Tarot pack.47. As we are now coming within the sphere of influence of the earth-plane, itmay be as well to explain what these lesser cards of the Tarot pack represent indivination. They symbolise the different modes of function of the differentSephirothic forces in the four worlds of the Qabalists. The suit of Wandscorresponds to the spiritual level; Cups to the mental level; Swords to theastral plane; and Pentacles to the physical plane.Consequently, if the Seven of Pentacles turns up in a divination, it means thatthe Mystical Qabala Page 161influence of Netzach is playing a part on the physical level. There is an oldproverb,\"Lucky in love, unlucky at cards,\" which is but another way of saying that theperson who is attractive to the opposite sex is usually in perpetual hot water.Venus is a disturbing influence in worldly affairs. She distracts from theserious business of life. As soon as her influence comes through to Malkuth, shemust hand over the sceptre to Ceres and leave well alone. It is children, notlove, that keep the home together. The Qabalistic name of the Seven of Pentaclesis \"Success Unfulfilled,\" and we have only to look at the lives of Cleopatra,Guinevere, Iseult, Heloise to realise that Venus upon the physical plane has forher motto, \"All for love, and the world well lost.\"48. The suit of Swords is assigned to the astral plane. The secret title of theSeven of Swords is \"Unstable Effort.\" How well does this express the action ofVenus in the sphere of the emotions, with its short-lived intensity.49. The secret title of the Seven of Cups is \"Illusory Success.\" This cardrepresents the working of Venus in the sphere of mind, where her influence is byno means conducive to clearsightedness. We believe what we want to believe whenwe are under the influence of Venus. Upon this plane her motto tnight well be\"Love is blind.\"50. Only in the sphere of the spirit does Venus come into her own. Here hercard, the Seven of Wands, is called \"Valour,\" which well describes the dynamicand vitalising influence she exerts when her spiritual significance isunderstood and employed.51. Very interestingly do the four Tarot cards assigned to Netzach reveal thenature of the Venusian influence as it comes, down the planes. They teach us avery important lesson, for they show how essentially unstable this force isunless it is rooted in spiritual principle. The lower forms of love are of theemotions, and essentially unreliable; but the higher love is dynamic andenergising.CHAPTER XXIIIHODTITLE: Hod, Glory. (Hebrew spelling: He, Vau, Daleth.)

The two root-powers of the universe are represented on the Tree of Life byChokmah and Binah, Positive and Negative Force. It is held by the Qabalists thatalthough each Sephirah emanates its next in numerical order, that these twoSupernals of[Page 238]the Tree being once established, are reflected down it diagonally in aparticular way. This is clearly indicated in the Yetziratic Text of thisSephirah, wherein it says that Hod \"has no root by which it can cleave or rest,save in the hidden places of Gedulah, from whence emanates its proper essence.Gedulah, be it remembered, is another name for Chesed.2. Binab is the Giver of Form. Chesed is cosmic anabolism, the organisation ofthe units formulated by Binah into complex, interacting structures; Hod, thereflection of Chesed, is in its turn a Sephirah of Form, and represents thiscoagulating principle in another sphere.Mystical Qabala Page 1633. Chokmah, on the other hand, is the dynamic principle; it reflects intoGeburah, which is the Cosmic Katabolist, representing the breaking-down of thecomplex into the simple, thus releasing latent energy; and this reflects againinto Netzach, the life-force of Nature.4. It is important for the understanding of the five lower Sephiroth to notethat the present stage of evolution has brought some degree of development ofhuman consciousness in their Spheres. Tiphareth represents the higherconsciousness wherein the individuality unites with the personality:Netzach and Hod represent the force and form aspects of astral consciousnessrespectively. Because human consciousness has made a degree of development inthese spheres, their purely cosmic nature is considerably overlaid by itsinfluences; and as human consciousness, being developed in Malkuth, is aconsciousness of forms derived from the experience of physical sensations, theconditions of Malkuth are reflected back, though in a rarefied form, into Hodand Netzach, and in a lesser degree into Tiphareth; Yesod is even more markedlyconditioned by the rising influence of Malkuth.5. This is due to the fact that the mind of any being of a sufficient degree ofdevelopment to have achieved an independent will works objectively on itsenvironment, thereby niodifying it. Let us make this clear by an illustration.Creatures of a lowly development, such as the simple forms of life that have nomotile power, like sea-anemones, can exercise[Page 240]very little influence over their environment; but a highet and more intelligenttype of creature can exercise a great deal, forcing its environment, by itsenergy and intelligence, to conform to its will, as when a beaver builds a dam.Human beings, the highest of all the creatures of matter, have learnt toexercise a profound influence on their environment, so that the material globeis gradually being brought into sublection to man, whole spheres, in fact, beingthus harnessed.6. The conditions with regard to each level of consciousness are preciselyanalogous. The mind builds up out of mind-stuff and the spiritual nature out ofthe spiritual forces of the Cosmos in exactly the same way that the sea-anemonebuilds up its substance out of the nutriment brought to it by the water. Thehigher types of personality, however, are analogous to the higher types ofanimals in that they can in an increasing degree, according to their energy andcapacity, influence their subtle environment; the mind, built up out ofmind-stuff, making its influence felt in the plane of mind.7. We observe in dealing with the astral plane, which is essentially the levelof function of the denser aspects of the human mind, that the forces and factorsof this plane present to consciousness as ethereal forms of a distinctly humantype; and if we approach the subject philosophically, and not credulously,we areat a loss to explain how this can be.The initiate, however, has his explanation. He declares that it is the humanmind itself which has created these forms by representing these intelligentnatural forces to itself as Mystical Qabala Page 164having forms of a human type; reasoning by analogy that, because they areindividualised, their individuality must have the same kind of vehicle for itsmanifestation as his own individuality.8. This, of course, does not necessarily follow. In fact, these forms of life,left to their own devices, achieve incarfiation in natural phenomena, theirvehicles being co-ordinations of natural forces such as a river, a range ofmountains, or a storm. Wherever man comes in touch with the astral, whether aspsychic or magician, he always anthropomorphises and creates forms in his ownlikeness to represent to himself the elusive subtle forces that he isendeavouring to contact, understand, and harness to his will. He is a true childof the Great Mother, Binah, and carries his natural propensities for organismand form-making to whatever plane he is able to exalt consciousness.9. The forms perceived on the astral plane by those who can see there, are theforms that have been made by the imagination of men to represent these subtlenatural forces of other forms of evolution than the human. The intelligences ofother forms of evolution than ours, if they come into touch with human life, cansometimes be persuaded to make use of these forms, just as a man puts on adiving-dress and descends into another element. A certain, and fundamental, typeof magic deals with the making of these forms and the inducing of entities toensoul them.10. Let us consider what is done when such a process is afoot. Primitive man,who is much more psychic than civilised man, his mind not being so elaboratelyorganised by education, is intuitively aware that there is a subtle somethingbehind any highly organised unit of natural force that differentiates it fromevery other unit. Humans are subconsciously aware of this to a greater degreethan they will admit; it is not for nothing that a ship is \"she,\" and that wespeak of \"Father Thames.\" A savage, then, feeling this life behind phenomena,tries to get into touch with it in order that he may come to terms with it. Ashe obviously cannot hope to conquer it, he must make terms with it, just as hewould with other alien lives ensouled in the bodies of another tribe. In orderto come to terms there must be a parley. One cannot make terms with persons whowill not parley.The savage thinks, reasoning by his own primitive method of analogy, that thebeings behind the phenomena dwell in a kingdom similar to that in which his owndream-life goes on; as daydreams are close akin to the dreams of sleep, and havethe advantage of being inducible at will, he tries to approach these beings ofanother sphere by entering their kingdom; that is to say, he fabricates inday-dream or phantasy the closest approach[Page 242]he can to the visions of the night, and if he can achieve a hi~h degree ofconcentration, he is able to close down his waking consciousness and entervoluntarily into the dreann~state in a dream of his own determining.11. In order to achieve this end, he builds up in his imagination a mentalpicture intended to represent the being that is the presiding genius of thenatural phenomenon he wishes to come to terms with; he builds it up repeatedly;he adores it; he prays to it; he invokes it. If Mystical Qabala Page 165his invocation be sufficiently fervent, the being he is seeking will hear himtelepathically and may become interested in what he is doing; if his adorationand sacrifices are agreeable to it, its co-operation may be obtained. Graduallyit may become tamed and domesticated; and finally, it may be persuaded to ensoulfrom time to time the form that has been built up out of mind-stuff for itsvehicle. Success in this operation depends, of course, on the degree to whichthe worshipper can appreciate through sympathy the nature of the being he isbent upon invoking, and he can only do this in proportion as his own temperamentpartakes of its nature.12. If this process is successful, then we have the domestication of a portionof the life of Nature, and its incarnation in a form built for it by itsworshippers. As long as the astral form is kept alive by the appropriate kind ofworship, carried Out by worshippers who have the necessary capacity to enterinto sympathetic communion with that kind of life, there is an incarnated god,available for contacting, brought down within the range of human perception.Should the worship cease, the god withdraws to his own place in the bosom ofNature. 8hould. other worshippers come along, however, who possess the knowledgenecessary to build a form in accordance with the nature of the life that is tobe invoked, and the imaginative sympathy necessary to invoke it, it is acomparatively simple ~natter to attract into the form once more the life thatwas accustomed to ensoul it; no more difficult, at least, than to catch with abasket of oats a horse that has run wild on the ranges.13. Now, it may be said, all this is the wildest speculation and sheerdogmatism. How do I know that that is the way in which primitive man went towork? Because that is the way of going to work that has come down in the secretMystery Tradition from very ancient times, and because when it is used loyanyone who has acquired the necessary degree of skill in concentration and knowsthe symbols that are used for building the different forms, the method works,and back come the Old Gods to the altar fires re-kindled.Definite results are obtained in the consciousness of the worshippers; and ifthey borrow the technique of the spiritualist, and a materialising medium isavailable, phenomena of a very definite kind are produced.14. It is the method that is used in working the Mass by those priests who haveknowledge. There are two types of priest in the Roman Church: the beneficedparish clergy and the men who belong to monastic Orders and undertake parish,and especially home mission, work as part of their service. These monksfrequently bring to the working of the Mass a very high degree of magical power,as any psychic can testify. It is the ensouling of an astral form with spiritualforce which is the real act of Transub~tantiation. It is in the knowledge ofthese things, and in the possession of organised bodies of men and women trainedin their use in the encloistered Orders, that the strength of the One Catholicand Apostolic Church lies; it is the lack of any such inner knowledge which isthe weakness of the schismatic communions, a lack that makes the Anglicanrituals, even when worked with full ceremonial, as water unto wine when comparedwith the Roman rituals; for the men who work them have no knowledge of thesecret workings which are 'ttaditional in the Roman communion, and are nottrained in the technique of visualising. I am not a Catholic, and never shallbe, because I would not Mystical Qabala Page 166submit to their discipline, nor do I believe that there is only One Name underheaven whereby men may be saved, much as I revere that Name, but I know powerwhen I see it, and I respect it.15. But the power of the Roman Church does not lie in charter, but in function.It is powerful, not because Peter received the Keys (which he probably didn't),but because it[Page 244]knows its job. There is no reason why priests of the Anglican communion shouldnot work with power if they apply the principles I have explained in thesepages. In the Guild of the Master Jesus, which is part of my own Organisation,the Fraternity of the Inner Light, we work the Mass with Power because we applythese principles. When we first started we were offered Apostolic Succession forout ministrants, but declined it because we felt that it was better to use ourknowledge to make the contacts anew on our own account than to receive ApostolicSuccession from a source that was not above suspicion, and experience hasjustified our choice.II16. For the full understanding of the philosophy of magic we must remember thatsingle Sephiroth are never functional; for function one must have the Pair ofOpposites in balanced equilibrium, resulting in an equilibrated Third which isfunctional. The Pair of Opposites, by themselves, are not functional becausethey are mutually neutralising; it is only when they unite in balanced force toflow forth as a Third, after the symbolism of Father, Mother, and Child, thatthey achieve dynamic activity, as distinguished from the latent force which isfor ever locked up in them, awaiting to be called forth.17. The functioning triangle of the Lower Triad consists of Hod, Netzach, andYesod.Hod and Netzach, as we have noted before, are respectively Form and Force on theastral plane. Ye sod is the basis of etheric substanice, Akasha, or the AstralLight, as it is variously called. Hod is especially the Sphere of Magic, becauseit is the sphere of the formulation of forms, and is therefore the sphere inwhich the magician actually works, for it is his mind that formulates the forms,and his will that makes the link with the natural forces of the Sphere ofNetzach that ensoul them. Be it noted, however, that without the contacts ofNetzach, the force aspect of the astral, there could be no ensouling; and withNetzach, being the Sphere of emotions, the contacts are made through sympathyand \"feeling with.\" The power of the will projects the magician out of Hod, butonly the power of sympathy can take him into Netzach. A cold-blooded person ofdominating will can no more be an adept working with power than can afluidically sympathetic person of pure emotion. The power of the concentratedwill is necessary to enable the magician to gather himself together for hiswork, but the power of imaginative sympathy is essential to enable him to makehis contacts. For it is only through our power to enter imaginatively into thelife of types of existence different to our own that we can Mystical Qabala Page167pick up our contacts with the forces of Nature. To attempt to dominate them bypure will, cursing them by the Mighty Names of God if they resist, is sheersorcery.18. As we have already noted, it is through the correspond mg factors in our owntemperaments that we come into touch with the forces of Nature. It is the Venuswithin that puts us in touch with the influences symbolised by Netzach. It isthe magical capacity of our own mind that puts us in touch with the forces ofthe Sphere of Hod-Mercury-Thoth. If there is no Venus in our own nature, nocapacity to respond to the call of love, the gates of the Sphere of Netzach willnever open to us and we shall never receive its initiation. Equally, if we haveno magical capacity, which is the work of the intellectual imagination, theSphere of Hod will be a closed book to us. We can only operate in a Sphere afterwe have received the initiation of that Sphere, which, in the language of theMysteries, confers its powers. In the technical working of the Mysteries theseinitiations are conferred on the physical plane by means of ceremonial, whichmay be effectual, or may not. The gist of the matter lies in the fact that onecannot waken into activity what is not already latent. Life is the realinitiator; the experiences of life stimulate into function the capacities of ourtemperaments in such degree as we possess them. The ceremony of initiation, andthe teachings that should be given in the various grades, are simply designed tomake conscious what was previously subconscious, and to bring under the controlof the will, directed by the higher[Page 246]intelligence, those developed reaction-capacities which have hitherto onlyresponded blindly to their appropriate Stimuli.19. Be it well noted that it is only in proportion as our capacities forreaction are lifted out of the sphere of emotional reflexes and brought underrational control that we can make of them magical powers. It is only when theaspirant) having the capacity to respond on all planes to the call of Venus) caneasily and without effort refrain at will from responding, that he can be madean initiate of the Sphere of Netzach. This is why it is said of the adept thathe has the use of all things, hut is dependent upon nothing.20. These concepts are shadowed forth for those who have eyes to see in thesymbolism of Hod. The Yetziratic Text declares that Hod is the PerfectIntelligence because it is the mean of the Primordial. In other words, it ispower in equilibrium, for the word \"mean\"implies a position half-way between two extremes.21. The concept of inhibited reaction and satisfaction foregone is expressed inthe title of the Eight of Cups of the Tarot pack, whose secret name is\"Abandoned Success.\" The suit of Cups, in the Tarot symbolism, is under theinfluence of Venus and represents the different aspects and influences of love.\"Abandoned Success,\" the inhibition of the instinctive reaction which would givesatisfaction-in other words, sublimation-is the key to the powers of Hod. Butremember that sublimation is not the same thing as either repression oreradication, and it applies to the instinct of self-preservation as well as tothe instinct of reproduction, with which it is exclusively associated in thepopular mind.Mystical Qabala Page 16822. The same concept reappears in the secret title of the Eight of Swords, whichis \"The Lord of Shortened Force.\" We get a clear image in these words of thechecking, or braking of dynamic power in order that it may be brought undercontrol.23. In the Eight of Pentacles, which represents the nature of Hod manifesting onthe material plane, we have the Lord of Prudence-again a checking and inhibitinginfluence.But all these three negative, inhibiting cards are summed up under thepresidencY of the Eight of Wands, which represents the action of the Sphere ofHod on the spiritual plane, and this card is called the Lord of Swiftness.24. We see, then, that it is through inhibitions and refrainings on the lowerplanes that the dynamic energy of the highest plane is rendered available. It isin the Sphere of Hod that the rational mind imposes these inhibitions on thedynamic animal nature of the soul; condensing them; formulating them; directingthem by limiting them and preventing diffusion. This is the operation of themagic that works with symbols. By its means the free-moving natural forces areconstrained and directed to ends that are willed and designed. This power ofdirection and control is only obtained by the sacrifice of fluidity, and Hod istherefore aptly said to be the reflection of Binah through Chesed.25. Having considered the general principles of the Sphere of Hod, we are now ina position to consider its symbolism in detail.26. The meaning of the Hebrew word Hod is Glory, and this suggests at once tothe mind that in this, the first Sphere in which forms are definitely organised,the radiance of the Primordial is shown forth to human consciousness. Physiciststell us that light is only rende.~ed visible as blue sky owing to its reflectionfrom the particles of dust in the atmosphere. Absolutely dustless atmosphere isabsolutely dark atmosphere. And so it is in the metaphysics of the Tree. Theglory of God can only shine forth in manifestation when there are forms tomanifest it.27. The Magical Image of Hod affords a very interesting subject for meditation.Those who have grasped the significance of the preceding pages will see how wellthe form-and-force nature of magical working is summed up in this symbol of thebeing in whom are combined the male and female elements.28. Hod is essentially the sphere of forms ensouled by the forces of Nature; andconversely, it is the sphere in which the forces of Nature take on sensibleform.[Page 248]29. The Yetziratic Text has already been discussed at length, and to thatdiscussion the reader can refer for its elucidation.30. The God-name of Hod, Elohim Tzabaoth, God of Hosts, contains thehermaphroditic symbol in a very interest mg way, for the word Elohim is afeminine noun with a masculine plural, thus indicating in the manner of theQabalists that it represents a dual Mystical Qabala Page 169type of activity, or force functioning through an organisation. All threeSephiroth in the Negative Pillar of the Tree have the word Elohim as part of theGod name.Tetragrammaton Elohim in Binah; Elohim Gebor in Geburah; and Elohim Tzabaoth inHod.31. The word Tzabaoth means a host or army, and 50 we get the idea of the DivineLife manifesting in Hod by means of a host of forms ensouled with force, incontradistinction to the fluidic activity of Netzach.32. The assignation of the mighty Archangel Michael to Hod again gives us foodfor thought. He is always represented as trampling upon a serpent and piercingit with a sword, and frequently holds in his hand a pair of balances, symbolicof equilibrium and expressive of the same idea as the Yetziratic words, \"Mean ofthe Primordial.\"33. The serpent upon which the great Archangel treads is primitive force, thephallic serpent of the Freudians; and this glyph teaches us that it is therestrictive \"prudence\" of Hod which \"shortens\" primitive force and prevents itfrom overflowing its boundaries.The Fall, be it remembered, is represented on the Tree by the Great Serpent withseven heads which overpasses the bounds set for it and raises its crowned headseven unto Daath. It is very interesting to observe the manner in which thesymbols weave in and out of each other, and reinforce and interpret each other'ssignificance and yield their fruits to Qabalistic contemplation.34. The Order of Angels functioning in Hod are the Beni Elohim, the Sons of theGods.Again we have the concept of the \"God of Hosts\" or armies. One of the mostimportant concepts of arcane science concerns the working of the Creator throughintermediaries.The uninitiated and profane conceive of God as working as the labourer works,who adds brick to brick with his hands, fashioning the edifice; but theinitiated conceive of God as working as the Great Architect of the Universe,designing His plans on the plane of archetypes; to Whom come the overseers, thearchangels, for their instructions, ~hese last directing the armies of humbletoilers who add stone to stone according to the archetypal plan of the MostHigh. Whenever did the architect designing the edifice work upon it with his twounaided hands? Never, not even when the universe was abuilding.35. The Mundane Chakra, as we have already noted, is Mercury, and its symbolismas Hermes-Thoth we have already considered.36. The Spiritual Experience assigned to this Sephirah is the Vision ofSplendour, which is the realisation of the glory of God manifesting in thecreated world. The initiate of Hod sees behind the appearance of created thingsand discerns their Creator, and in the realisation of the splendour of Nature asthe garment of the Ineffable he receives his illumination and becomes aco-worker with the Great Artificer. It is this realisation of the spiritualforces manipulating all manifestations and appearances which is the key to thepowers of Hod as wielded in the Magic of Light. It is by making himself achannel for these forces that the Master of White Magic brings order into thedisorder of the Spheres Mystical Qabala Page 170of Unbalanced Force, not by deflecting the invisible powers to his personalwill. He is the equilibrator of the unbalanced, not the arbitrary manipulator ofNature.37. In this Sphere, which is the Sphere of Mercury-Hermes, god of science andbooks, how clearly can we see that the supreme virtue is truthfulness, and thatthe obverse aspect of this Sephirab is that which reveals Mercury in his aspectas the god of thieves and cunning rogues. In esoteric ethics it is realised thateach plane has its own standard of right and wrong. The standard of the physicalplane is strength; the standard of the astral plane is beauty; the standard ofthe mental plane is truth; and the standard of the spiritual plane is that ofright[Page 250]and wrong as we understand the terms; therefore there is no ethic except interms of spiritual value; all else is at best expediency. In the Sphere which isessentially the Sphere of the concrete mind how right it is that the Qabalabshould give the supreme virtue as truthfulness.38. The Correspondence in the Microcosm is given as the loins and legs, inaccordance with the astrological ruling of the planet Mercury.39. The symbols associated with Hod are given as the names and versicles and theapron.The names are the Words of Power wherein the magus sums up and evokes intoconscious ness the multiform potencies of the Beni Elohim. These names are by nomanner of means arbitrary and barbaric vocables, without etymology or meaning.They are philosophical formulae. In some cases their interpretation isetymological, as in the case of the Egyptian deities, whose names are built upout of the names of potencies and symbols when used to indicate compositeforces. In all systems of magic, however, which have their root in the Qabalah,the magical names are built up out of the numerical value of the consonants ofwhatever sacred alphabet is used; there is a Greek, an Arabic, and a CopticQabalah, as well as the better-known Hebrew one. These consonants, when replacedby the appropriate numerals, yield a number, which can be dealt withmathematically in many ways. Some of these ways are according to the methods ofpure mathematics, the results being then translated back into letters again, andshowing very interesting correspondences with the names of similar or relatedpotencles. This is a very curious aspect of Qabalistic lore, and in the hands ofcompetent exponents yields interesting results; it is, however, full of pitfallsfor the unwary, for there is no limit to what it can be made to yield, and onlya sound knowledge of first principles can tell us when the analogies arelegitimate or otherwise, and prevent us from falling into credulity andsuperstition.40. The versicles are mantric phrases, a mantra being a sonorous phrase which,when repeated over and over after the manner of a rosary, works upon the mind asa special form of auto-suggestion, the psychology of which is too complex to beentered upon now.Mystical Qabala Page 17141. The apron has immediate associations for the initiates of Solomon the Wise;it is the characteristic garment of the initiate in the Lesser Mysteries, who isalways deemed figuratively to be a craftsman, that is a maker of forms, and asthe Sepbirah Hod is the Sphere of the operations of the makers of magical forms,it will be seen that this symbolism is again apposite. The apron covers andconceals the Moon-centre, Yesod, concerning which we shall speak in itsappropriate place. As has already been noted, Yesod is the functional aspect ofthe Pair of Opposites of the astral plane.42. Concerning the four Eights of the Tarot pack, assigned to this Sephitah, wehave already spoken on a previous page.43. To sum up, then, in Hod we have the Sphere of formal magic as distinguishedfrom simple mind power. The forms that are formulated thereon by the magicianinitiating the forces of nature are the Beni Elohim, or Sons of the Gods.CHAPTER XXIVYESODTITLE: Yesod, the Foundation.

The study of the symbolism of Yesod reveals two apparently incongruous setsof symbols. Upon the one hand[Page 252]we have the conception of Yesod as the foundation of the universe, establishedin strength; this is indicated by therecurrence of the idea of strength, as in the Magical Image of a beautiful nakedman, very strong, the God-name of Shaddai,Almighty, the Kerubim, the strong angels, and the Nine of Wands, whose secretname is the Lord of Great Strength. But upon the other hand we have the Moonsymbolism, which is very fluidic, in a continual state of flux and reflux, underthe presidency of Gabriel, the archangel of the element of Water.2. How are we to reconcile these conflicting concepts? The answer is to be foundin the words of the Yetziratic Text, which says of the Ninth Path that it\"purifies the Emanations. It proves and corrects the designing of theirrepresentations, and disposes of the unity with which they are designed withoutdiminution or division.\" This concept is further illuminated by the nature ofthe Spiritual Experience assigned to Yesod, which is described as \"the Vision ofthe Machinery of the Universe.\"3. We get the concept, then, of the fluidic waters of chaos being finallygathered up and organised by means of the \"representations\" that were \"designed\"in Hod; this final\"proving, correcting, and disposing of the unity\" of these \"representations\" orformative images resulting in the organisation of the \"Machinery of theUniverse,\" the vision of which constitutes the spiritual experience of thisSephirah. In fact, Yesod might aptly be described as the Sphere of the Machineryof the Universe. If we liken the kingdom of earth to a great ship, then Yesodwould be the engine-room.4. Yesod is the sphere of that peculiar substance, partaking of the nature ofboth mind and matter, which is called the ~ther of the Wise, the Akasha, or theAstral Light, according to the terminology that is being used. It is not thesame as the ether of the physicists, Mystical Qabala Page 173which is the fire element of the Sphere of Malkuth; but is to that ether whatthat ether is to dense matter; it is, in fact, the basis of the phenomena whichthe physicist attributes to his empirical ether. The Ether of the Wise might, infact, be called the root of the ether of physics.[Page 254]5. The material universe is an insoluble riddle to the materialist because heinsists on trying to explain it in terms of its own plane. This is a thing thatcan never be done in any sphere of thought. Nothing can ever be explained interms of itself, but only by being resumed in a greater whole. The four elementsof the ancients find their explanation in a fifth, the Ether, as initiates havealways maintained. For it is a doctrine of esoteric philosophy that any fourvisible states always have their root in a fifth, an invisible state.For instance, the Four Worlds of the Qabalists have their root behind the Veilsof the Unmanifest. It is only by positing this unmanifest fifth, and assigningto it certain attributes deduced from the manifest four as being essential inthe prime cause, that we are able to arrive at any understanding of the natureof the four. So do we find in Yesod the unmanifest fifth of the four elements ofMalkuth, the fire of the ancients answering to the ether of the moderns, andearth, water, and air to the solid, liquid, and gaseous states of matter.6. Yesod, then, must be conceived of as the receptacle of the emanations of allthe other Sephiroth, as is taught by the Qabalists, and as the immediate andonly transmitter of these emanations to Malkuth, the physical plane. As theYetziratic Text says, it is the function of Yes od to purify the emanations, andto prove and correct them; consequently it is in the Sphere of Yesod that alloperations are carried out which are designed for the correcting of the Sphereof dense matter, or in any way to dispose of its unity of design.Yesod, then, is the all-important Sphere for any magic which is designed to takeeffect in the physical world.7. Now be it well noted that all Spheres operate according to their nature, andthat that nature cannot in any way be altered by any magical or miraculousinfluence, however powerful; we can only \"correct\" the \"designing\" of therepresentations. The things represented remain constant. The conditions of thematerial world cannot therefore be arbitrarily disposed of, even by the highestspiritual force, as is believed by those who pray to God to intervene on theirbehalf, healing their diseases or giving rain upon earth; neither can they anymore be influenced by the most powerful wizard with his spells. The onlyapproach to Malkuth is through Yesod, and the approach to Yesod is through Hod,where the \"representations\" are \"designed.\" Let us once and for all disabuse ourminds of the idea that spirit can work directly upon matter; it never does so.Spirit works through mind, and mind works through the 'Ether; and the 'Ether,which is the framework of matter and the vehicle of the life-forces, can bemanipulated within the limits of its nature, which are by no meansinconsiderable. All miraculous and supernatural happenings, therefore, arebrought about by the manipulation of the natural qualities of the 'Ether, and ifwe understood the nature of the 'Ether, we should understand the rationale oftheir production. We should no longer attribute them to the direct MysticalQabala Page 174intervention of God, or to the activities of the spirits of the departed, thanwe attribute nowadays the phenomena of combustion to the activities ofphlogiston, which a previous generation believed to be the active principle offire, whose presence or absence determined whether a given substance would burnor not. There are men living to-day who learnt about phlogiston in theirschool-days, and have seen the change of thought come about; equally, the daywill come when men will look upon psychic phenomena and \"spiritual\" healing aswe look upon phlogiston.8. At the present state of our knowledge it is not possible to give a very fullaccount of the nature of the Yesodic 'Ether. We can, however, state certainthings about it that have been learnt by experience. Much has been learnt byexperiments with ectoplasm, which is very close akin to it in nature; in fact,one might describe it as organic Ether, in contradistinction to the ether ofphysics, which is inorganic Ether. We know that ectoplasm takes on forms, andholds them and relinguishes them with equal readiness, showing that it is notthe form which confines the life, but the life that determines the form. Welikewise know that ectoplasm can be emanated and absorbed, though we do not knowthe conditions that[Page 256]govern this phenomenon. Ectoplasm is, in fact, a kind of ethereal protoplasm;and we might conceive of tbe {? YLtbCb} or Astral Light as bearing the samerelationship to ectoplasin as ectoplasm bears to protoplasm.9. But although we no more know the ultimate nature of the astral 'Ether than weunderstand the ultimate nature of electricity, nevertheless we know byobservation that it possesses certain properties. We do not merely deduce theseproperties; we know they exist by experience, because they enable us tomanipulate this subtle 5ubstance in certa~n definite ways, within, as hasalready been explained, the limits of its own nature. Two of these propertiesare all-important to the work of the practical occultist, forming, in fact, thebasis of his whole system.10. The first of these properties is the capacity of the astral 'Ether to bemoulded into forms by the mind; the second is the capacity of the astral 'Etherto hold the molecules of dense matter in its mesh-like lines of tension as in arack of pigeon-holes. It may be asked) how do we know that the other possessesthese qualities, so vital to our magical hypothesis? We answer that theexistence of these properties is the only explanation of the properties ofliving matter and conscious mind. We cannot explain either mind or matter interms of themselves alone; we cannot explain mind without employing terms ofsensation, and we cannot explain living matter without employing terms ofconsciousness. Sensation must always be an affair of both mind and matterinexplicable in isolation. To explain neural sensation we must posit a substancethat is intermediate between mind and matter; to understand purposive movementwe equally require the existence of such a substance-that is, which possessesthe power to receive and hold the impress of thought and to influence theposition in space of the atomic units of tilatter.These are the properties we assign to our hypothetical astral 'Ether, advancingthe same Mystical Qabala Page 175arguments in justification 0£ this proceeding as have been accepted on behalf ofa similar proceeding in the case of the ether of physics. We plead {? pi~C~dent}for our hypothesis; and if the arguments in favour of the ether of physics areacceptable, it is difficult to see why an 'Ether should not be permitted topsychology. It is an old maxim that hypotheses should not be unnecessarilymultiplied, but when an hypothesis such as that of ether has proved so fruitful,we are surely amply justified in experimenting with a similar one in the sisterscience of psychology. One thing is quite certain, psychology never made anyreal progress while it limited itself to the materialistic viewpoint andregarded consciousness as an epiphenomenon, that is to say as an irrelevant andpurposeless by-product of physiological activity if anything in Nature can becalled irrelevant and purposeless. Let us learn a lesson from coal-tar, theirrelevant and purposeless by-product of the production of gas-to be practicallygiven away to anyone who wanted to tar a fence, subsequently found to be thesource of most valuable chemicals, dye-stuffs, and drugs.II11. From the point of view of magic, Yesod is the all-important Sephirah, justas Tiphareth is the functional sphere of mysticism, with its transcendentcontacts with the Supernal. If the Tree of Life be considered as a whole, itwill be seen clearly that it works in triads. The Three Supernals having theircorrelatives on a lower arc in Chesed, Geburab, and Tiphareth. Anyone who hashad experience of practical Qabalism knows that for all practical purposesTiphareth is Kether for us while we tabernacle in this house of flesh, for noman may look upon the face of God and live. We can only see the Father reflectedin the Son, and Tiphareth shows us the Father.\"12. Netzach, Hod, and Yesod form the Lower Triad, overshadowed by Tiphareth asthe Lower Self is overshadowed by the Higher Self. One might, in fact, say thatthe four lower Sephiroth form the Personality, or unit of Incarnation, of theTree; the Higher Triad of Chesed, Geburah, .and[Page 258]Tiphareth form the Individuality, or Higher Self, and the Three Supernalscorrespond to the Divine Spark.13. It will be observed that although each Sephirah is considered to emanate itssuccessor, the Triads are always represented, when once emanated and inequilibrium, as a Pair of Opposites manifesting in a Functional Third. In this,the Lower Triad, then, we find Netzach and Hid equilibriated in Yesod, which isconceived as receiving their emanations. But it also received the emanations ofTiphareth, and through Tiphareth, of Kether, because there is always a line offorce working down a Pillar; consequently, as it received also from Netzach andHod the influences that they in their turn have received from their respectivePillars, it may aptly be called, in the words of Qabalists, the Mystical QabalaPage 176\"receptacle of the emanations\"; and it is from Yesod that Malkuth receives theinflux of the Divine forces.14. Yesod also is of supreme importance to the practical occultist, because itis the first Sphere with which he makes acquaintance when he commences to \"riseon the planes,\"and lifts consciousness above Malkuth. Having trodden the terrible Thirty-secondPath of the Tau or Cross of Suffering, and of Saturn, he enters Yesod, theTreasure House of Images, the sphere of Maya, Illusion. Yesod, considered byitself, is unquestionably the Sphere of Illusion, because the Treasure House ofImages is none other than the Reflecting Aether of the Earth-sphere, andcorresponds in the microcosm to the Unconscious of the psychologists, filledwith ancient and forgotten things, repressed since the childhood of the race.The Keys that unlock the doors of the Treasure House of Images and enable us tocommand its denizens are to be found in Hod, the Sphere of Magic. It is trulysaid in the Mysteries that no degree becomes functional until one has taken thenext. Anyone who tries to function as a magician in Yesod soon learns his error,for although he can perceive the Images in the Treasure House, he has no word ofpower with which to command them. Therefore in initiation upon the Western Path,at any rare (I cannot answer for the Eastern, not knowing it), the grades of theLesser Mysteries go straight up the Central Pillar to Tiphareth, and do notfollow the line of the Lightning Flash. In Tiphareth the initiate takes thefirst grade of adepthood, and from there returns, if he so desires, to learn thetechnique of the magician relative to the Personality of the Tree, that is tosay the macrocosmic unit of incarnation. If he does not desire this, but wishesto become free from the wheel of Birth and Death, he proceeds up the CentralPillar, which is also called by the Qabalists the Path of the Arrow, and passesover the Abyss into Kether. He who enters this Light cometh not forth again.15. Yesod is also the Sphere of the Moon; therefore to understand itssignificance we must know something about the way in which the Moon is regarderin occultism. It is held by initiates that the Moon separated from the Earth atthe period when evolution was on the cusp between the etheric phase of itsdevelopment and the phase of dense matter.Those who are familiar with the termonology of astrology will know that the cuspis that phase between two signs wherein the influence of both is intermingled.The Moon, then, has something of the material in its composition, hence theluminous globe we see in the sky; but the really important part of itscomposition is etheric, because it was during the phase of evolution when lifewas developing the etheric form that the Moon had its heyday, and for thisreason the phase is called by some occultists the Luna Phase of evolution. Thosewho want to know more of this subject will find it dealt with in The RosicrucianCosmo-conception, by Max Heindel, and The Secret Doctrine, by Mme Blavatsky. Asthe Qabalists use a different system of classification to the Vedantists, wecannot open up the vast subject of the \"Rays and the Rounds\" in these pages. Itmust suffice to give dogmatically certain facts known to occultists and indicatewhere the reader can find further information if he desires it.16. The Moon and teh Earth, according to the occult theory, share one ethericdouble.through their two physical bodies are separate, and the Moon is the seniorpartner; that Mystical Qabala Page 177[Page 260]is to say, in etheric matters the Moon is the Positive Pole of the battery, andthe Earth the negative one. Yesod, as We have already seen, reflects the Sun ofTiphareth, which in its turn is Kether on a lower arc. Astronomers have longtold us that the Moon shines by borrowed light, reflected from the Sun, and theyare now beginning to hint that the Sun may receive its fiery energy from outerspace. Translated into Qabalistic terminology, outer space would be the GreatUnmanifest, and the Qabalists have taught this doctrine since the days whenEnoch walked with God and was not, for G04 had taken him-in other words, he hadreceived the initiation of Kether.17. It will be seen from the above that Yesod-Luna is ever in a state of fluxand reflux, because the amount of sunlight received and reflected waxes andwanes in a twenty-eight day cycle. Malkuth-Earth is also in a state of flux andreflux in a twenty-four hour cycle, and for the same reason. LikewiseMalkuth-Earth has a three hundred and sixty-five day cycle, of which the phasesare marked bythe Equinoxes and the Solstices. It is the interacting set of thesetides which is all-important to the practical occultist, because so much of hiswork depends upon them. The charts of these tides have always been kept secret,and some of them are exceedingly complex. As these concern the secret workings,the genuine and legitimate occult secrets, which are only given afterinitiation, they cannot be dealt with in these pages. Enough has been said,however, to indicate that certain tides in the lunar 'Ether exist and areimportant, and that students of the occult are probably wasting their time ifthey try to operate without the necessary charts.18. These lunar tides play a very important part in the physiological processesof both plants and animals, and especially in the germination and growth ofplants and the reproduction of animals, as witness the twenty-eight day lunatsexual cycle of the human female. The male has a sexual cycle based on the solaryear, but in the artificially lit and heated houses of civilisation this cycleis not so marked, though the poet drew our attention to the fact that \"In thespring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love,\" and the referencehas been found so apt that it is almost too hackneyed for quotation.19. It is the light of the Moon which is the stimulative factor in these ethericactivities, and as Earth and Moon share one etheric double, all ethericactivities are at their most active when the Moon is at its full. Likewise,during the dark of the Moon, etheric energy is at its lowest, and unorganisedforces have a tendency to rise up and give trouble. The Dragon of the Qliphothraises his multiple heads. In consequence, practical occult work is best letalone during the dark by all but experienced workers. The life-giving forces arerelatively weak and the unbalanced forces relatively strong; the result, ininexperienced hands, is chaos.20. All psychics and sensitives are conscious of the set of these cosmic tides,and even those who are not avowedly sensitive are affected by them far more thanis generally realised, especially in illness when the physical energies are low.Mystical Qabala Page 17821. Not a great deal can be said concerning Yesod, because in her are hidden thekeys of the magical workings. We must therefore content ourselves withelucidating the symbolism in a somewhat cryptic form, though he that hath earsto hear is at liberty to use them.22. We have already noted the curious two-sided nature of Netzach and Hod, themagical image of Hod being a hermaphrodite, and Venus-Aphrodite sometimes beingrepresented among the ancients as bearded. In Yesod again we meet with this dualsymbolism, and yet again, as we shall see presently, in Malkuth. This indicatesclearly that in these Sephiroth belonging to the lower levels of the Tree wemust very definitely recognise a form and force side in each one. This comes outvery clearly in both Yesod and Malkuth, to Which both gods and goddesses have tobe assigned.23. Yesod is essentially the Sphere of the Moon, and as such comes under thepresidency of Diana, the moon-goddess of the Greeks. Now Diana was primarily achaste goddess, ever-virgin, and when the over-presumptive Actaeon annoyed[Page 262]her he was torn to pieces by his own hunting-hounds. Diana, however, wasrepresented at Ephesus as the Many-breasted, and regarded as a fertilitygoddess. Moreover, Isis is also a lunar goddess, as indicated by the lunarcrescent upon her brow, which in Hathor becomes the cow-horns, the cow beingamong all peoples the especial symbol of maternity. In the Qabalistic symbolism,the generative organs are assigned to Yesod.24. All this is very puzzling at first sight, for the symbols appear to bemutually exclusive. Carried a step further, however, we begin to find connectinglinks between the ideas.25. The Moon has three goddesses assigned to her, Diana, Selene or Luna, andHecate, the latter being the goddess of witchcraft and enchantments, and alsopresiding over child-birth.26. There is also a very important moon-god, none otber than Thoth himself, Lordof Magic. So then, when we find Hecate in Greece and Thoth in Egypt bothassigned to the Moon, we cannot fail to recognise the importance of the Moon inmatters magical. What thert is the key to the magical Moon, who is sometimes avirgin goddess and sometimes a fertility godders?27. The answer is not very far to seek. It is to be found in the rhythmicalnature of the Moon, and, in fact, in the rhythmical nature of sex-life in thefemale. There are times when Diana is many-breasted; there are times when herhounds tear the intruder to pieces.28. In dealing with the rhythms of Luna we are dealing with etheric, notphysical, conditions. The magnetism of living creatures waxes and wanes with adefinite tide. Jt is Mystical Qabala Page 179a thing that is not difficult to observe when one knows what to look for. Itshows itself most clearly in relations between persons in whom magnetism isfairly evenly balanced.Sometimes one will be in the ascendant, and sometimes the other.29. Now, it may be asked, if the Sphere of Yesod is etherie, why are thegenerative organs assigned to this sphere, for surely their function ispbysical, if anything is? The answer to that question is to be found in theknowledge of the subtler aspects of sex which appears to be entirely lost to theWestern world. It cannot be entered upon in detail in these pages, and it mustsuffice to point out that all the more important aspects of sex are etheric andmagnetic. We might liken it to an iceberg, five-sixths of whose bulk is belowthe surface. The actual physical reactions of sex form a very small proportion,and by no means the most vital portion of its functioning. It is owing to ourignorance of this that so many marriages fail to fulfil the purpose of thewelding of two halves into a perfect whole.30. We take no account of the magical side of marriage, despite the fact thatthe Church classes it as a sacrament. Now a sacrament is defined as an outwardand visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, and it is that inward andspiritual grace which is so seldom found in the marriage act of the Anglo-Saxonraces, with their relatively frigid temperament and contempt for the body. Thatinward and spiritual grace which makes of marriage a true sacrament after itskind is not the grace of sublimation, or renunciation, or a purity of denial andabstention; it is the grace of the blessing of Pan in the joy in natural thingsso beautifully expressed by Walt Whitman in his poem-series, Children of Adam.\"31. The assignation to Yesod of the perfumes and sandals is very significant.These two things play a very important part in magical operations. The sandals,or soft heelless Slippers that give free play to the foot, are always used inceremonial work to tread the magical circle. They are as important a part of theequipment of the practical occultist as his rod of power. God said unto Moses,Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holyground.\" The adept makes holy ground for himself by placing upon his feet theconsecrated sandals. The floor-cloth, of the appropriate colour and marked withthe appropriate symbol5, is also an important piece of lodge furniture. Jt isdesigned to concentrate the earth magnetism used in the[Page 264]Operation in the same way that the altar is the focus of the spiritual forces.Through our feet we pick up the earth magnetism; and when that magnetism is of aspecial kind) we use special slippers that shall not inhibit it.32. The perfumes, too, are very important in ceremonial operations, for theyrepresent the etheric side of the affair, Their psychological influence is wellknown, but the fine art of using them psychologically has been but littlestudied outside occult lodges. The use of perfumes is the most effectual way ofplaying on the emotions, and consequently of changing the focus ofconsciousness. How quickly do our thoughts turn away from Mystical Qabala Page180earthly things when the driftin~ smoke of incense comes to us from the highaltar; how quickly do they return to them again when we get a whiff of patchoulifrom the next pew!33. And in the four Tarot cards assigned to this Sephirab how clearly do we seethe workings of the etberic magnetism appearing. There is Great Strength when weare on the earth-contacts and blessed of Pan; there is also Material Happiness;in fact, without the blessing of Pan there can be no material happiness becausethere is no peace of the nerves. On its negative side, however, are to be foundthe depths of Despair and Cruelty; but with the earth-contacts firm under ourfeet there comes Material Gain because we are adequate to deal with the materialplane.CHAPTER XXVMALKUTHTITLE: Malkuth, the Kingdom.

It will be observed that the conformation of the Tree falls naturally intothree functional triangles, but that Malkuth participates in no such triangle,but stands apart, and it is said by the Qabalists that it receives theinfluences or emanations of all the other Sephiroth. But although Malkuth is theonly Sephirah that does not participate in a triangle, it is also the onlySephirah that is represented as parti-coloured instead of a unit, for it isdivided into four quarters, which are assigned to the four elements of Earth,Air, Fire, and Water. And although it is not functional in any triangle, itrepresents the end-results of all the activities of the Tree. It is the nadir ofevolution, the outermost point on the outgoing arc, through which all life mustpass before returning whence it came.2. Malkuth is said to be the Sphere of Earth; but we must not make the mistakeof thinking that the Qabalists meant by Malkuth only the terrestrial sphere.They meant also the Earth-soul-that is to say, the subtle, psychic aspect ofmatter; the underlying noumenon of the physical plane which gives rise to allphysical phenomena. Likewise with the four elements. These are not earth, air,fire, and water as known to the physicists, but are the four conditions in whichenergy can exist. The esotericist distinguishes these from their mundanecounterparts by referring to them as the Air of the Wise, or the Earth of theWise, as the case may be. That is to say, the Element of Air or of Earth as itis known to the initiate.Mystical Qabala Page 1823. The physicist recognises the existence of matter in three states. Firstly, assolid, wherein the particles of which it is composed adhere firmly to eachother; secondly, liquid, in which the particles move freely over each other;thirdly - gaseous, in which the particles all try to get as far away from eachother as possible, or in other words to diffuse. These three modes of mattercorrespond to the three elements of Earth, Water, and Air, and electricalphenomena corresponds to the element of Fire. Esoteric Science classifies allphenornena manifesting upon the physical plane under these four headings, asgiving the best clue to the real understanding of their nature ; and itrecognises that any given force can pass from one stage to another under certainconditions, just as water can exist in a state of ice and steam as well as itsnormal fluidity.4. The esotericist sees in Malkuth the end-result of all operations; not untilthe Pairs of Opposites have achieved the settled equilibrium which gives thestate of Earth, or coherence, can they be said to have completed any given cycleof experience. When this is achieved, they build a permanent vehicle ofmanifestation and stereotype its reactions; the machinery of expression thusevolved becomes self-regulating, and will continue to function with the minimumof attention, just as the human heart opens and shuts its valves with perfectregularity in response to a stereotyped cycle of nervous impulses and thepressure of the blood.5. The great point to remember in connection with Malkuth is that herein isachieved stability. It is in the inertia of Malkuth that its virtue lies. Allthe other Sephiroth are in varying degrees mobile; even the Central Pillar onlyachieving equilibrium in function, just as a tight-rope walker achieves it6. Like all the other Sephiroth, Malkuth can only be under-stood when consideredin relation to its neighbours. But in this case there is Only oneneighbour~Yesod. No understanding of Malkuth can be arrived at save through anunderstanding of Yesod.7. For while Malkuth is essentially the sphere of form, all coherence of parts,save simple mechanical stresses and electromagnetic attractions and repulsions,depend upon the functions of Yesod. And Yesod, though it is essentially aform-giving Sephirab, depends for the manifestation of its activities upon thesub~tance provided by Malkuth. The forms of Yesod are such stuff as dreams aremade of till they have picked up[Page 268]the material particles of Malkuth to body forth their forms. They are systems ofstresses into whose framework the physical particles are built.8. And equally with Malkuth, it is inanimate matter until the powers of Yesodensoul it.9. We should conceive of the material plane as the Outward and visible sign ofinvisible etheric activity. Malkuth, in its prime essence, is only known to theinstruments of the physicist. It goes without saying that where there is life,there is Yes od, because Yesod is the vehicle of life; but it should also berealised that where there is any kind of electrical Mystical Qabala Page 183activity or conductivity, whether of crystals, metals, or chemicals, there isYesodic force in function. It is this fact which makes certain substancessuitable for use as talismans, because they will take a charge of astral force.10. It is not possible in these pages to go into a detailed study of esotericphysics; enough must be said, however, to give the student an understanding ofthe principles underlying this concept of the material world, which sees it asvisible drapery upon an invisible framework.11. The exact nature of the relationship between Yes od and Malkuth must beclearly understood, because it is all-important for practical occult work. Yesodis, of course, the form-giving principle, and whatever form is built up in itsSphere will be bodied forth in the Sphere of Malkuth unless it containsincompatibles, for it will tend to draw to itself the conditions of materialexpression. Material particles, however, are extremely resistant andunresponsive in their nature, and it is only by working upon the most tenuousaspect of matter, to which initiates give the name of the Element of Fire, thatYesodic forces can produce any effects. Once a response can be obtained fromthis Elemental Fire, the other Elements can in their turn be influenced.12. Elemental Fire, however, is a kind of over-state of matter with which onlythe most advanced physics has any acquaintance. It might best be called a stateof relationship rather than a thing in itself. Elemental Air might be describedas a capacity to achieve these relationships, and as such, is the vitalprinciple of physical life; for it is only in so far as matter has a capacityfor Organisation that organic substance is possible. Elemental Water, the Waterof the Wise, is just plain protoplasm; and Elemental Earth is inorganic matter.13. Now each of these types of organised force and reaction-capacity has its ownvery definite nature, from which it will depart no hair's-breadth for any forcein the manifested cosmos. But as there are definite interrelations of influenceand expression between these four elemental states, it is possible, by usingtheir influence one over the other, to achieve results which for want ofunderstanding are called magical. It is, of course, the method of magic tomanipulate these tenuous elemental forms; but it is also the method of life todo the same thing, and if magic is to be anything more than auto-suggestion, itmust use the methods of life-that is to say, it must work through theintermediation of protoplasm, for protoplasm, in its curious web-like structure,carries the subtle magnetic force of the Fire of the Wise, transmitted throughelemental air. In other words, the operator has to use his own body as aself-starter; for it is the magnetism of his own protoplasm that supplies thebasis of manifestation of any force that is being brought through into theSphere of Malkuth. Carried to its logical conclusion, this is the principle ofgeneration, whether of protozoa or spermatozoa.14. The modern concept of matter approximates very closely to that which hasbeen held by esoteric science from time immemorial. What our senses perceive arethe phenomena attributable to activities of different types of force, usually inorganisation and combination. Only through an understanding of the nature ofthese forces is the nature of Mystical Qabala Page 184matter to be understood. Exoteric science is dealing with the problem byrefining its concept of matter till there is no substance left in it. What thephysicist now knows as matter is very far removed from the obvious.15. The esotericist, approaching the problem from the opposite direction, pointsout that matter and mind are two[Page 270]sides of the same coin, but that there comes a point in one's investigation whenit is profitable to change over terminology, and talk of forces and forms interms of psychology, as if they were conscious and purposive. This, he says,enables us to deal with the phenomena we encounter mucb better than we can do ifwe limit ourselves to terms only applicable to inanimate matter and blind,undirected force. We must always, by the nature of our intellect, use analogy asa help to understanding; if the analogies we use on this level of theinvestigation are the analogies of inanimate matter, we shall find them soinadequate as to be very limiting and misleading, and darkeners of counsel ingeneral.16. If, however, we use the terminologies of life and intelligence and purposivewill, duly diluted to the requirements of the very rudimentary state ofdevelopment of that wirn which we have to deal, we shall find we have an analogywhich is illuminating instead of limiting, and which will lead on to advancementin understanding.17. It is for this reason that the esotericist personifles the subtler forcesand calls them Intelligences. He then proceeds to deal with them as if they wereintelligent, and he finds that there is a subtle side of his own nature andconsciousness which responds to them, and to which, he fondly believes, theyrespond. At any rate, whether the response is mutual or not, his powers ofdealing with them are, by this means, greatly extended beyond those which hepossasses when he regards them as \"a fortuitous concourse of uncorrelatedincidents.\"II18. Malkuth is the nadir of evolution, but it should be looked upon, not as theultimate depth of unspirituality, but as the marking-buoy in a yacht race. Anyyacht that puts about on to the homeward course before it has rounded themarking-buoy is disqualified. And so it is with the soul. If we try to escapefrom the discipline of matter before we have mastered the lessons of matter, weare not advancing heavenwards, but suffering from arrested development. It isthese spiritual defectives who flock from one to another of the innumerablewildcat uplift organisations that come to us from the Far East and the Far West.They find in cheap idealism an escape from the rigorous demands of life. Butthis is not a way of advancement, but a way of retreat. Sooner or later theyhave to face the fence and clear it. Life brings them up to it again and again,and presently begins to use Mystical Qabala Page 185the whip and spur of psychological sickness; for those who will not face life,dissociate; and dissociation is the prime cause of most of the ills that mind isheir to.19. If we study the lessons of history we shall get much light on moral andspiritual problems from an unexpected angle. We see that all civilisation andinspiration arose in the East; a point to which those who are of Eastern race orfollow an Eastern tradition point proudly, saying that the West must sit at thefeet of the East if it is to learn the secrets of life.20. Now it cannot be denied that there are many things, especially the morerecondite aspects of psychology, concerning which the East knows a great dealmore than the West, and which we should be wise to learn; but it also cannot bedenied that, having originated in the East, the growing-point of evolution isnow to be found in the West, and that for every advance in the art of living onthis terrestrial planet, the East must look to the West unless it is content togo back to the spinning-wheel standard of life. But let it not be forgotten thatwith the primitive standard of life goes also the primitive standard of death.A primitive culture can only support a Sparse population. A great many peoplehave got to die, mostly the old and the young. When we return to Nature, shedeals with us after her own manner with her red tooth and claw. The unsoftenedimpact of Nature is not a pleasant thing. When human beings get too thick on theground, she Wipes them out with disease and starvation. With the white man'scivilisation goes the white man's sanitation.By refraining from all action one may achieve release from the bondage of thebody more quickly and effectually than one[Page 272]bargains for, if among the actions refrained from are those connected withcommunal cleanliness in a densely populated land.21. The Greeks understood the principle of Malkutli better than did anybodyelse, and they were the founders of the European culture. They taught us to seebeauty in perfect proportion and function, and nowhere else, The frieze offigures upon the Grecian urn turned the mind of Keats to the contemplation ofideal Truth and Beauty. There can be no higher ideal than this for the finitemind to contemplate, for in it the Law and the prophets are lifted far above thegrim forbiddings of the Mosaic code into the inspiration of an ideal to bepursued.22. It is in the Sphere of Malkuth that civilisation has wrought for the lastthousand years.It does not ii ced any astrologer to tell us that the Great War marked the endof an epoch, and that we are now in the dawn of a new phase. According toQabalistic doctrine, the Lightning Flash, having come down the Tree till it endsin Malkuth, is now replaced by the symbolism of the Serpent of Wisdom, whosecoils loop upwards on the Paths till its head rests beside Kether. The LightningFlash represents the unconscious descent of force, building the planes ofmanifestation, passing from active to passive and back again in order thatequilibrium may be maintained. The Serpent coiling upon the Paths represents thedawn of objective consciousness and is the symbol of initiation; by the MysticalQabala Page 186Path whereon the initiates have gone, ahead of their time, evolution isbeginning to go, taking with it the race as a whole. It is now becoming normalfor the average man to do what only the initiates used to do.23. We see the growing-point of evolution, then, beginning to rise out ofMalkuth and reach out towards Yesod. This means that science, both pure andapplied, is passing beyond the study of inanimate matter and is beginning totake account of the etheric and psychic side of things. This changing phase isvisible all around us for those who can read the signs of the times. We see itin medicine, in international relationships in industrial organisation. Last,and most reluctantly, we see it inaking itself felt in the sciences ofphysiology and psychology, which cling tenaciously to a materialisticexplanation of all things, and especially the life-processes, even afterphysics, which avowedly deals with inanimate matter, has abandoned thematerialistic position and talks in terms of mathematics.24. The occult division of Malkuth into the Four Elements gives us a veryvaluable key.We should regard matter as we know it as Earth of Malkuth. The different typesof physical activity, whether in molecules or masses, can be classified underthe two headings of anabolism and katabolism, that is to say the building-up andthe breaking~down processes; these can he classified in esoteric terminology asthe Water or Air of Malkuth, and whatever is said by esoteric philosophy orpagan mythology in relation to these elements will be applicable to these twometabolic processes and fonctions. The Fire of Malkuth is that subtleelectro-magnetic aspect of matter which is the link with the processes ofconsciousness and life, and to it all life-myths apply.25. When this principle of classification is understood, the terminology of thealchemists becomes less recondite and absurd, for it is seen that theclassification into Four Elements really refers to four modes of manifestationon the physical plane. This method of classification is of very great value,because it enables the relationship and correspondence between the physicalplane and the life-processes behind it to be readily seen. It is especiallyimportant in the study of physiology and pathology, and in its practicalapplication it is a most important key to therapeutics. The more advancedphysicians are beginning to feel their way towards this position, and theclassifications of Paracelsus are being quoted to-day by more than one leader ofmedical thought. The concept of diathesis or constitutional predisposition isreceiving attention. Psychotherapy, again, is beginning to see that the oldclassification into the four temperaments affords a useful guide to treatment,and that it does not do to handle everyone in the same way; nor yet that similarresults always spring from similar causes[Page 274]in the realms of mind, because temperament intervenes and falsifies the resuits.For instance, apathy in the phlegmatic type may simply mean boredom; whereas thesame degree of apathy in the sanguine type may mean a complete breakdown of thewhole personality. The analogies between material and mental things can be verymisleading; whereas the analogies between mental and material things can be veryenlightening.Mystical Qabala Page 18726. The four elements correspond to the four temperaments as described byHippocrates, the four Tarot suits, the twelve signs of the Zodiac, and the sevenplanets. If the implications of these statements are worked out, it will he seenthat herein are contained some very important keys.27. The Element of Earth corresponds to the Phlegmatic Temperament; the suit ofPentacles; the signs of Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn; and the planets Venus andLuna.28. The Element of Water corresponds to the Bilious Temperament; the Suit ofCups; the signs of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces; and the planet Mars.29. The Element of Air corresponds to the Choleric Temperament; the suit ofSwords; the signs of Libra, Gemini, and Aquarius; and the planets Saturn andMercury.30. The Element of Fire corresponds to the Sanguine Temperament; the suit ofWands; the signs of Aries, Sagittarius and Leo; and the planets Sol and Jupiter.31. It will be seen, then, that if we classify mundane affairs and phenomena interms of the Four Elements, we shall immediately see their relationship toastrology and the Tarot.Now classification is the stage that immediately follows observation inscientific method.A very great deal of scientific work simply consists in these two processes; infact, for the rank and file of science these represent the total range of theiractivities. If science is limited to these two activities, as it would be if welistened to our more pedestrian scientists, it would be no more than a compilingof lists of natural phenomena, as if the brokers were in on the universe. Butthe imaginative scientist, who alone is worthy of the name of research worker,uses classification not so much as a means of putting things away tidily, but toenable him to recognise relationships.32. From the imaginative scientist who perceives to the philosophic scientistwho interprets is but a step; and from the philosophical scientist whointerprets in terms of causation to the esoteric scientist who interprets interms of purpose, and so links science to ethics, is but another step. It is thetragedy of Esoteric Science that its exponents have nearly always beeninadequately equipped upon the plane of Malkuth, and consequently unable toco-ordinate their results with those obtained by workers in other fields. Aslong as we rest content with this state of affairs we shall continue to havemuddle-headed thinking and credulous assumptions as our inalienable lot.Esoteric Science needs to observe the rule of the yacht race, and make eachmagical operation round the marking-buoy of Malkuth before it is reckoned tohave achieved completion.33. Let us now interpret this simile from the point of view of technicaloccultism. Every magical operation is designed to bring power down the planesinto the reach of the operator, who then applies it to whatever ends he maydesign. Many operators are content if they can obtain purely subjectiveresults-that is to say, a sense of exaltation; others aim at the production ofpsychic phenomena. It should be recognised, however, that no operation iscompleted until the process has been expressed in terms of Malkuth, or, in otherwords, has issued forth in action on the physical plane. If this is not done,the force Mystical Qabala Page 188that has been generated is not properly \" earthed,\" and it is this loose forceleft lying around that causes the trouble in magical experiments. It may notcause trouble in a single experiment, as few operators generate enough power tocause anything, let alone trouble; but in a series of experiments the effect maybe cumulative, and result in the general Psychic upheaval and run of bad luckand queer happenings so often reported by experimenters. It is these sort ofthings that give experimental magic a bad name, and lead to its being regardedas dangerous and compared to drug addiction. The[Page 276]true analogy, however, would be with the dangers of X-ray research in its earlydays. It is faulty technique that gives rise to trouble, as it always must whenactive potencies are being handled. Perfect your technique and you get rid ofYour troubles and have a very potent force available for use.III34. The only means of transition from Yesod to Malkuth is through the mediumshipof living substances. Now there are various degrees of livingness. Theesotericist recognises life wherever there is organised form, for he says thatlife alone is the organiser of form, though in what are popularly calledinorganic substances the proportion of life is very small, and in some casesinfinitesimal. Jn some forms of inorganic matter, however, there is a by nomeans negligible proportion of life, just as in plants there is a by no meansnegligible proportion of intelligence. It is only recent advances inexperimental work, notably those of Sir Jagindranath Ilbose, that havedemonstrated this fact, but it has long been known empirically to the practicaloccultist. He has always made use of crystalline and metallic substances asstorage artreries of subtle forces. He has always regarded silk as an insulator.He has, in fact, availed himself of the properties of the same substances thatthe electrician employs to-day. The best talismans are considered to be disks ofpure metal engraven with suitable devices and kept wrapped in silk of a colourappropriate to the force with which the talisman is charged. A precious stone,which is of course a coloured crysral, is a very important part of certainoperations, because it is held ro act as a focus for the force. It is also avery important part of certain types of wireless receivers.The influence of colours on mental states is now well recognised. No worker isallowed to work for a lengthy period in the red light rooms of the manufacturersof photographic supplies, because it is recognised that such workers are liableto emotional disiuthance and even temporary mental unbalance. All these thingswe are rediscovering by means of modern scientific method and its instruments,but they were well known to the ancients, and their practical applications wereworked out to an extent that is not dreamed of to-day, save among the few whoare popularly known as \"cranky.\"35. Plants also we find credited with a varying degree of \"psychic activity.\"This is especially attributed to aromatic plants. The ancients had an elaboratesystem of attribution of plants to the difierent forms of subtle force. Some ofthese, of course, are Mystical Qabala Page 189fantastic, but there are certain broad principles which give guidance. Whereverwe find a plant traditionally associated with any deity we may be fairly certainthat that plant has been proven to have affinities with the type of force thatthat deity represents. It may be that the association appears to our modern eyesto be superficial and irrational, such associations as Freud has shown us thatthe dreaming mind employs; hut the worshippers of the deity, if the associationis hallowed by tradition, will have built up the psychic connection between theplant and the force, and as in all such traditional associations, onceestablished, the link is easily recoverable by those who know how to make use ofthe constructive imagination. Whether there is any intrinsic relationshipbetween the nature of the plant and the nature of the force to which it isassigned, as in the case of the rose to Venus and the lily to the Virgin Mary,such a relationship is speedily established by the worshippers of a cult andequally speedily recoverable by those who follow in their footsteps, even aftera lapse of centuries. Therefore for all practical purposes there is such arelationship, not only in relation to the plants assigned to a particular deity,but in relation to animals as well.36. An attribution which has especial practical importance is that of perfumesand colours. The colour attributions have already been given in the tables atthe head of each chapter. Concerning the perfumes, it is less easy to lay downhard and fast rules, as the available perfumes are almost countless, and theforces in practical working often tend to run one into the[Page 278]other. For instance, it is difficult, and in fact undesirable, to keep theforces of Netzach separated from those of Tiphareth, or those of Hod from Yesod,or Yesod from Malkuth; and anyone who tries working Geburab without Gedulabwould burn his fingers.37. Perfumes are used not only to enable the deity to manifest, but to tune theimagination of the operator. To this latter end they are most efficacious, asanyone will discover for themselves if they try to work a ceremony without theappropriate perfume. With inexperienced operators it is advisable to dispensewith the use of perfumes in case the psychic effect is too drastic for comfortor convenience.38. Broadly speaking, we can divide perfumes into those which exaltconsciousness and those which stir the subconscious to activity. Of those whichexalt consciousness the aromatic gums stand by themselves, and these areemployed exclusively in the manufacture of ecclesiastical incense, In additionto these, certain essential oils possess similar properties, espocially thosewhich are aromatic and astringent rather than sweet and spicy. These substancesare of value in all operations in which the aim is increased intellectualclarity or exaltation of the mystical type.39. The perfumes that awaken the subconscious mind are of two types, theDionysiac and the Venusian. The Dionysiac odours are of the aromatic, spicytype, such as smouldering cedar- or sandal-wood or pine-cones. The Venusianodours are of a sweet, cloying nature, such as vanilla. In actual practice thesetwo types of odours shade one into the other, and Mystical Qabala Page 190characteristic flower odours are to be found in both divisions. In the practicalwork of compounding the perfumes a blend of ingredients is almost alwaysemployed, as they enhance each other. Many perfumes which by themselves arecrude and acrid, or cloying and sickly, become admirable when blended.40. It has been said that synthetic perfumes are useless for magical work. In myexperience this is not the case, provided the essence is of good quality. Goodsynthetic essences are indistinguishable from the natural products save bychemical tests. As the value of perfumes is psychological, their action beingupon the operator, not upon the power invoked, the chemical nature of thesubstance is immaterial provided one gets the appropriate effect.41. The same applies to precious stones, rank heresy though it be to say so. Allone needs is a crystal of the appropriate colour, and whether it is a Burmeseruby or a Burma one makes no difference to anything except one's bank balance.That the ancients knew this is witnessed by the fact that in the lists ofprecious stones sacred to various deities alternative gems are always given. Forinstance, Crowley, in \"777\" gives pearls, moon-stones, crystal, and quartz asall being sacred to the moon-forces, and the ruby or any red stone as sacred toMars.42. It is believed by the occultist that the mental concentration of a currentof will, backed by the imagination, has an effect upon certain crystals, metals,and oils. He makes a use of this property in order to conserve in them forces ofa particular type so that these forces can be readily re-awakened at will, oreven exercise their influence all the time by means of a steady emanation. Mostceremonial depends in some degree at least upon the principle of the consecratedmagical weapons. It is noteworthy that all the more important equipment of achurch is always consecrated before it is taken into use. Whether thisconsecration is effective is not a matter of opinion. Any good psychic willreadily distinguish between consecrated and unconsecrated objects, provided, ofcourse, that the consecration has been effectual. It is a matter of experiencewith any practical occultist that a very definite change takes place in him whenhe takes his accustomed magical instruments in hand or purs on his accustomedrobes. He can do with these what he cannot do Without them. He also knows thatit takes rime to \"break in\" a new magical instrument. It is interesting to notein this respect that I am quite unable to write anything about the \"MysticalQabalah\" without my ancient and battered \"Tree[Page 280]of Life\" beside me. It is also interesting to note that when this Tree of Life,which was originally prepared for me by someone else, became so dingy as to bealmost undecipherable, I repainted it myself, and found thereafter that itimmediately took on a marked increase in magnetism: thus bearing out the oldtradition that one should always prepare one's magical weapons as far aspossible with one's own hands.43. The great problem in the practical working is to bring things through to theSphere of Malkuth. Many methods are described by the ancients - with how muchtruth one has no Mystical Qabala Page 191means of knowing. How far were actual materialisations obtained by the method ofblood-sacrifice described by Virgil, and how far did the exalted imagination ofthe participants in these awe-inspiring rites supply the basis of manifestation?44. But whatever may be the facts, the holocausts of the ancients are not apracticable method for the modern experimenter to follow. The basis of the idea,however, lies in the fact that freshly shed blood gives off ectoplasm. Thereare, of course, materialising mediums who also give off ectoplasm without theshedding of blood. But those who give off an appreciable quantity are few andfar between. When a number of psychically developed people are gathered togetherin a circle for the purpose of evocation they may, between them, give offsufficient ectoplasm to form the necessary basis for physical phenomena. Such amethod is not without its difficulties, not to say risks, and the esotericist,who is a philosopher ratherth an an experimenter, seldom makes use of it. It issufficient for him if he gets manifestations in the Sphere of Yesod andperceives them with the inner vision.45. The only satisfactory channel of evocation is the operator himself. In theEgyptian method of evocation, known as the assumption of the god-forms, theoperator identifies himself with the god and offers himself as the channel ofmanifestation. It is his own magnetism that bridges the gulf between Malkuth andYesod. There is no other method so satisfactory, for the amount of magnetism ina living being is far greater than in any metal or crystal, however precious.46. This ancient method is also known to us under another name; it is called bymoderns, mediumship. When the spirit speaks through the entranced medium,precisely the same thing is happening as happened in ancient Egypt when thepriest with the mask of Horus spake with the voice of Horus.47. When we consider the microcosmic Tree, the physical body is Malkuth; theetheric double is Yesod; the astromental body is Hod and Netzach; and the highermind is Tiphareth. Whatever the higher mind can conceive can readily be broughtthrough into manifestation in the subjective Malkuth. We do better to rely uponthis method of evocation rather than the extraneous devices of extrudedectoplasm or the outpouring of vital fluids, even if this latter device werepracticable in our modern civilisation.48 The best magical weapon is the magus himself, and all other contrivances arebut a means to an end, the end being that exaltation and concentration ofconsciousness which makes a magus of an ordinary man. \"Know ye not that ye arethe temple of the living God?\" said a Great One. If we know how to use thesymbolic furniture of this living temple, we have the keys of heaven in ourhands.49. The key to this use is given in the microcosmic attributions of the Tree.Interpreting these in terms of function, and function in terms of spiritualprinciples, we can unlock the door of the Storehouse of Force. The best and mostcomplete manifestation of the power of God is through the energised enthusiasmof the trained and dedicated man. We would be wiser if we looked for theend-result of a magical operation to come about through Mystical Qabala Page 192natural channels rather than to expect an interference with the course ofNature-an expectation that in the very nature of things is doomed todisappointment.50. Let us make this clear by illustration. Supposing we desire to healsickness, we should, working by the method of the Tree, employ a rite ormeditation of Tiphareth. But[Page 282]are we, for this reason, to limit our operations to the Sphere of Tiphareth andrequire the healing to be a purely Spiritual healing, as do the ChristianScientists? Or shall we modify our method sufficiently to allow of the laying onof liands and the anointing with oil, which are operations of the Sphere ofYesod, designed to conduct magnetic force? Or shall we, which appears to me thewiser method, make use of an operation of Malkuth also, thus bringing the powersteadily down the planes into manifestation without break or gap in thetransmutation and conduction?51. And what is an operation of the Sphere of Malkuth? Jt is simply action onthe physical plane. In an invocation of healing, therefore, I think we do betterto invoke the Great Physician to manifest His power to us through the humanphysician, for that is the natural channel, than to rely upon a spiritual forcefor which the only channel of evocation is the spiritual nature of the patient,who may or may not be able to rise to the occasion.52. That great spiritual forces can be brought to bear effectually upon thehealing of our diseases is beyond question, but they must have a channel ofmanifestation; and why be at great pains to build a psychic one when there is anatural one ready to hand? God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to performwhen natural law is a sealed book to us; but when we understand the ways ofNature's working, we see that God moves in a perfectly natural way, through theregularly established channels; the difference between the supernatural and thenatural does not lie in the channels of manifestation that are used, but in theamount of power that comes through them. Not in quality but in quantity does theflow of power alter when spiritual forces are successfully invoked.53. The whole problem of Malkuth is a problem of channels and connecting links.The rest of the work is done by the mind on the subtler planes; the realdifficulty lies in the transition from the subtle to the dense, for the subtleis so ill-equipped to work on the dense. This transition is effected by means ofthe magnetism of living things, whether organic or inorganic. C'est le dermerpar q~ co~te in magical operations.IV54. Three ideas issue from a contemplation of the Yetziratic Text related toMalkuth~the concept of the Resplendent In telligence which illuminates thesplendour of all the Mystical Qabala Page 193Lights; the relationship between Malkuth and Binab; and the function of Malkuthin causing an influence to emanate from the Angel of Kether.55. It may seem a curious idea that Malkuth, which is the material world, shouldbe the illuminator of the Lights; we can understand this, however, if we referto the analogy of physics, which tells us that the sky only appears blue andluminous owing to the reflection of light from the innumerable dust particlesfloating in the atmosphere; absolutely dustless air is unilluminated, and oursky would have the darkness of interstellar space if it were not for these dustparticles. We also learn from the study of physics that we see objects solely bymeans of the rays of light they reflect from their surfaces. When there islittle or no reflection, as with black cloth, it is almost invisible in a dimlight, a property made much use of by conjurers and illusionists.56. It is the formative, concreting function of Malkuth which finally renderstangible and definite what was, upon the higher planes, intangible andindefinite, and this is its great service to manifestation and itscharacteristic power. All the Lights, that is to say the emanations of all theother Sephi roth, become illuminated, visible, when reflected from the concreteaspects of Malkuth.57. Every magical operation must come through to Malkuth before it can bereckoned to have attained completion, for only in Malkuth is the force finallylocked home into form.Therefore all magical work is better carried out in the form of a ritualperformed on the physical plane, even if the operator is working alone, thansimply as a form of meditation operating upon the astral plane only. There mustbe something[Page 284]upon the physical plane, even if it be no more than lines drawn on a talisman,or the writing of signs upon the air, which brings the action through to theplane of Malkuth.Experience proves that an operation so terminated is a very different matter toan operation which begins and ends on the astral.58. The relationship between Malkuth and Binah is very clearly indicated in thetitles assigned to both these Sephiroth. Binab is the Superior Mother andMalkuth the Inferior Mother. As we have already seen, Binab is the primordialGiver of Form. Malkuth being the Sphere of Form, the relationship is obvious.That which had its inception in Binah has its culmination in Malkuth. This pointgives us an important clue by means of which to guide our researches among theramifications of the polytheistic pantheons. The Qabalistic system is explicitconcerning the doctrine of Emanations, whereby the One unfolds into the Many,and the Many are reabsorbed into the One. No other system is specific upon thispoint, though in all of them it is hinted under the guise of genealogies.The begettings and matings of the gods and goddesses, by no means always in holywedlock, give definite indication of the implicit doctrines of emanation andpolarity, and are not merely ribald phantasies of primitive man, creating thegods in his own image and likeness.Mystical Qabala Page 19459. A careful comparison of the information that has come down to us concerningthe rites by which the ancients worshipped their many gods soon reveals that theclear-cut myths so delightfully retold for children have little bearing on theactual religion of the folk who used them as the means of expression forspiritual teachings. The gods and goddesses melt one into the other in the mostperplexing fashion, so that we get the Bearded Venus, and Hercules, of allpersons, arrayed in female clothes.60. It is clear from a study of ancient art that the persons and characteristicsof the various gods and goddesses were used as a form of picture-writing toindicate definite abstract ideas, of which the convention was well understood bythe priesthood. Having to deal with an illiterate population for the most part,for learning was limited to a very few in those days, they wisely said, Look onthis symbol and think about this story; you may not know what it means, if youare looking in the right direction, the direction whence light arises; and inproportion as you are able to receive it, light will flow into your soul if youcontemplate these ideas. It is probable to the point of certainty that theillumination given in the Mysteries included the elucidation of the metaphysicsof these myths.61. Persephone, Diana, Aphrodite, Hera, all exchange their symbols, functions,characteristics, and even subordinate titles in a bewildering manner in Greekmyths and art. Likewise do Priapos, Pan, Apollo, and Zeus. The best we can sayof them is that all the goddesses are Great Mothers and all the gods are Giversof Life; the difference between them lying not in function but inhe level upon which they function. A distinction is drawn between the CelestialVenus and the goddess of earthly love of the same name; the discerning can seean equal distinction, and an equal underlying identity, between Zeus theAll-Father, and Priapos, equally addicted to fatherhood, but after anothermanner, the one being earthly where the other is celestial. Nevertheless, theyare not two gods, but one god: just as Binab and Malkuth are not two distincttypes of force, but the same force functioning on different levels. This is thekey to the understanding of the significance of phallic worship, which plays soimportant a part in all ancient and primitive faiths, a part so littleunderstood by their scholastic interpreters. Its real meaning is the bringingdown of the godhead into manhood in the hope of taking manhood up into godhead.A process which is also the basis of the Freudian therapy.62. The statement that Malkuth causes an influence to emanate from the Angel ofKether further bears out this idea. We see that the Great Mother, which isMalkuth, polarises with the All-Father, which is Kether.63. This classification, however, is too simple to serve us adequately, whetherwe are reducing a pagan pantheon to[Page 286]its simplest terms or dealing with the chances and changes of personal life. Butin the four quarters, or elements, into which Malkuth is divided we find the keythat we need.Mystical Qabala Page 19564. These four elements are said to be the Earth, Air, Fire, and Water of theWise-that is to say, four types of activity. They are represented in thenotation of esoteric science by four different types of triangle. Fire isrepresented by a triangle point upwards; Air by a similar triangle with a baracross it, thus indicating that Air may be esteemed as akin in nature to Fire,but denser. In fact, we should not go far wrong if we called Air, Negative Fire,or Fire, Positive Air. Water is represented by a triangle point downwards, andEarth by the same triangle with a bar across it; and to these two symbols thesame principles apply as to their predecessors.65. Supposing, then, we consider the Fire triangle as representing unconditionedforce and the Air triangle as representing conditioned force, the Earth triangleas representing totally inert form and the Water triangle as representing anactive type of form, we have another mode of classification available. In themost ancient myths, the air, or space-god, is the parent of the sun, celestialfire, and water is the matrix of earth. This comes out clearly on the CentralPillar of the Tree of Life, where Kether, space, overshadows TipLareth, thesun-centre, and the watery Yesod, the moon-centre, overshadows the earthyMalkuth.66. Or supposing we arrange the symbols composing the glyph after anothermanner, which it is the glory of the Tree that it enables us to do, and placethem as the four Elements, citrine, olive, russet, and black, in the sphere ofMalkuth, and consider the life-force descending from Kether as operating afterthe manner of an alternating current of electricity, which the doctrine ofalternating polarity teaches us to do, we find that force will sometimes beflowing from Malkuth to Kether, and sometimes from Kether to Malkuth.67. Now this is an all-important point when applied to the microcosm, for itteaches us that we need to be in circuit with the Earth-soul just as much aswith the God of Heaven; there is an inspiration that rises up from theunconscious quite as much as there is an inspiration that flows down from thesuperconscious.68. This comes out clearly in the Greek myths, wherein we find such positiveeart~forces as Pan, who, by virtue of his goat-symbolism, cannot be assignedotherwise than to the Sphere of Earth, for Capricorn is the most earthy of theearthy triplicity. Pan represents the positive magnetism of the earth uprushingin its return to the All-Father. Ceres, on the other hand, or many-breastedDiana, who are both very earthly Venuses and far from virgin, represent thefinal earthmg of the heavenly force in dense matter. Hera, who has been calledthe Celestial Venus or heavenly Aphrodite, represents the return of theuprushing earth-force to heaven, and is eatth-positive on a celestial level.69. These are things difficult to elucidate to those who have not seen the sunat midnight.They yield much to meditation, but little to disputation.VMystical Qabala Page 19670. In the Sphere of Malkuth are worked all divinations. Now the object of anymethod of divination is to find a set of things on the physical plane whichcorrespond accurately and comprehensively to the invisible forces in the sameway that the movements of the hands of a clock correspond to the passage oftime.71. For revealing general trends and conditions it is agreed by universalexperience of those who have studied such matters that astrology is the bestsystem of correspondences.But for obtaining an answer to a single questio~i it is not sufficientlyspecific, for too many factors may come in to modify the result. The initiateddiviner, therefore, makes use of the more specific systems, such as divinationby the Tarot or geomancy, when he wants to obtain an answer to a specificquestion.72. But it is of little use to go into a shop and buy a pack of Tarot cardsunless there is the knowledge necessary to build[Page 288]up the astral correspondences to each card. This takes time, as there areseventy-two cards to work with. Once it is done, however, the operator can takethe cards into his hands with a considerable degree of confidence that hissubconscious mind, whatever that may be, will all unwittingly deal the cardsthat refer to the matter in question. Exactly how the shuffle and deal isaffected we do not know, but one thing is certain, when the Great Angel of theTarot has been contacted, the cards are remarkably revealing.73. Having considered the general principles of the Sphere of Malkuth, we arenow in a position to study its special symbolism with profit.74. It is called the Kingdom~in other words, the sphere ruled by the King-andthe King is the title of Microprosopos, who consists of the six centralSephiroth, excluding the Three Supernals. We may regard Malkuth, or the materialSphere, as the sphere of manifestation of these six central Sephiroth, whichthemselves are emanated by the Three Supernals. Everything then, ends inMalkuth, even as everything begins in Kether.75. The Magical Image of Malkuth is a young woman, crowned and veiled; this isthe Isis of Nature, her face veiled to show that the spiritual forces are hiddenwithin the outer form. This idea is also present in the symbolism of Binah,which is summed up in the concept of \"the outer robe of concealment.\" Malkuth,as is clearly set forth in the Yetziratic Text, is Binah upon a lower arc.76. Now Binah is called the Dark Sterile Mother, and Malkuth is called the Brideof Microprosopos, or the Bright Fertile Mother, and these correspond to the dualaspects of the Egyptian moon-goddess as Isis and Hathor, Isis being the positiveaspect of the goddess, and Hathor the negative aspect. In Greek symbolism thesewould correspond to Aphrodite and Ceres. Now Aphrodite is the positive aspect ofthe female potency, for be it remembered that under the law of alternatingpolarity that which is negative on the outer planes is positive on the inner,and vice versa. Aphrodite, the Celestial Venus, is the Mystical Qabala Page 197giver of magnetic stimulus to the spiritually negative male; it is because herfunction is not understood in modern life that so much is wrong with modernlife. Binab, the higher aspect of Isis, is, however, barren, because thepositive pole is always the giver of the stimulus, but never the producer of theresult. The Malkuth aspect of Isis is the Bnght Fertile Mother, the goddess offecundity, thus indicating the end-result of the operation of Isis on thephysical plane.77. The situation of Malkuth at the foot of the Pillar of Equilibrium places itin the direct line of the descent of power from Kether, transmuted in Daath, theInvisible Sephirab, and passing on to the planes of form via Tiphareth. This isthe Path of Consciousness, whereas the two Side Pillars are Paths of Function;but the two Side Pillars also converge on Malkuth via the Thirty-first andTwenty-ninth Paths. Consequently everything ends in Malkuth.78. We who are incarnated in physical bodies are standing in Malkuth, and whenwe set out upon the Way of Initiation our route lies up the Thirty-second Pathto Yesod. This Path, straight up the Central Pillar, is called the Path of theArrow, which is shot from Qesheth, the Bow of Promise; it is by this route thatthe mystic rises upon the planes; the initiate, however, adds to his experiencethe powers of the Side Pillars as well as the realisations of the Middle Pillar.79. This aspect of the Central Pillar is expressed in the Yetziratic Textwherein it states that Malkuth causes an influence to emanate from the Prince ofCountenances, the Angel of Kether.80. The additional titles assigned to Malkuth bring out its attnbutes clearly.It is regarded as the Gate and the Mate. These two ideas are in essence oneidea, for the womb of the Mother is the Gate of Life. It is also the Gate ofDeath, for birth into the plane of form is death to higher things.81. Malkuth is also said to be Kallah, the Bride of Microprosopos, and Malkah,the Queen of Male kh, the King. This clearly indicates the function in polaritythat prevails between[Page 290]the planes of form and the planes of force; the planes of form being the femaleaspect, polarised and made fertile by the influences of the planes of force.82. The God-name in Malkuth is Adonai Malekh, orAdonai ha Aretz, which titlesmean, the Lord who is King, and the Lord of Earth. Herein we clearly see theassertion of the supremacy of the One God in the Kingdoms of Earth, and everymagical operation, wherein the operator takes power into his own hands, shouldcommence with the invocation of Adonai to indwell his temple of earth and ruletherein, that no force may break from its allegiance to the One.Mystical Qabala Page 19883. Thdse who call upon the Name of Adonai call upon God made manifest inNature, which is the aspect of God adored by initiates of the Nature Mysteries,whether Dionysian or Isiac-which concern the different ways of openingsuper-consciousness via subconsciousness.84. The archangel is the great angel Sandalphon, who is sometimes called byQabalists the Dark Angel; whereas Metatron, the Angel of the Countenance, is theBright Angel.These two angels are held to stand behind the right and left shoulders of thesoul in its hours of crisis. They might be taken to represent good and badkarma. It is in reference to the function of Sandalphon as the Dark Angelpresiding over the Karmic Debt that Malkuth is called the Gate of Justice andthe Gate of Tears. It has been said by a wit, with more truth than he knew, thatthis planet was actually some other planet's hell. It is in very fact the spherein which karma is normally worked out. Where there is sufficient knowledge,however, karma can be worked out deliberately on the subtler planes, and thismethod is one of the forms of spiritual healing..85. The Order of Angels assigned to Malkuth are the Ashim, the Souls of Fire, orFiery Particles, of which Mme Blavatsky says some very interesting things. ASoul of Fire is in actual fact the consciousness of an atom; the Ashim thereforerepresent the natural consciousness of dense matter; it is these which bestow onit its characteristics. It is these Fiery Lives, these infinitesimal electricalcharges, which are for ever weaving backwards and forwards with tremendousactivity in the background of matter and form its basis.Everything that we know as matter builds up on this groundwork. It is with thehelp of these Fiery Lives that certain types of magic are worked. There are butfew who can work such magic, for the denser the plane to be manipulated, thegreater must be the power of the Magus who commands it.86. The Mundane Chakra of Malkuth is the Sphere of the Elements. These we havealready considered in such detail as is possible in these pages.87. The Spiritual Experience of Malkuth is the Vision of the Holy GuardianAngel. Now this angel, which according to the Qabalists is assigned to each soulat birth and companions him till death, when it takes him into its keeping andpresents him before the face of God for judgment, is in actuality the HigherSelf of each one of us, which builds up around the Divine Spark that is thenucleus of the soul and endures for an evolution, sending down a process intomatter at each incarnation to form the basis of the new personality.88. When the Higher Self and the Lower Self become united through the completeabsorption of the lower by the higher, true adepthood is gained; this is theGreat Initiation, the Lesser Divine Union. It is the supreme experience of theincarnate soul, and when this takes place, it is freed from any compulsion torebirth into the prison-house of flesh. Thenceforth it is free to go on up theplanes and enter into its rest, or, if it so elects, to remain within theearth-sphere and function as a Master.Mystical Qabala Page 19989. This, then, is the spiritual experience which is assigned to Malkuth-thebringing down of the Godhead into manhood, just as the spiritual experience ofTiphareth is the taking up of manhood into the Godhead.90. The especial virtue of Malkuth is said to he Discrimination. This idea isfurther carried out in the curious symbolism of the ancients which declared thecorrespondence in the[Page 292]microcosm to be with the anus. Whatever in life is effete has to be excreted,and the macrocosmic excretion is into the Qliphothic spheres which depend belowMalkuth, whence the cosmic excreta cannot return to the planes of organised formuntil they find balance in equilibrium. There is, there-fore, in the Qliphothicworld, a sphere which is not Hell, but Purgatory; it is a reservoir ofdisorganised force emanated from broken-up forms, cast out from evolution; it isChaos upon a lower arc. It is from this reservoir of force that is accustomed toform, and therefore organises readily, that the Shells, or imperfect entities,build up their vehicles. It is also said to be drawn upon for the lower types ofmagic of an evil kind. The tendency of such forces as are available in theQliphothic sphere must always be to assume once more such forms as they wereaccustomed to before they were disintegrated and reduced to their primal state;as these forms were at least out of date, if not actively evil, it naturallyfollows that this matter of chaos is not a desirable substance to work in; andhad best be left there till its purification is complete and it has filteredback through the Sphere of Earth by the natural channels, and been drawn onceagain into the stream of evolution. It is for this reason that all theunderworld cults and the evocation of the departed are undesirable, for theforms the manifesting entities assume must be built in part at least of thissubstance of Chaos.91. It is the especial virtue of Malkuth, then, to act as a kind of cosmicfilter, casting out the effete and preserving that which still retains itsusefulness.92. The characteristic vices of the functioning of Malkuth are said to beavarice and inertia. It is easy to see how the stability of Malkuth can beoverdone, and so give rise to sluggishness and inertia. The concept of avarice,though not so obvious upon the surface, soon yields its significance toinvestigation; for the over-retentiveness of avarice is a kind of spiritualcostiveness, the exact opposite of the discrimination which rejects the excretaof life through the cosmic anus into the cosmic cesspool of the Qliphoth. It isinteresting to note that Freud declares that the miser is invariablyconstipated, and associates the dream of money with faeces.93. One of the most important things we have to do before we can rise out of thelimitations of life in Malkuth and breathe a wider air, is to learn how to letgo; how to sacrifice the lesser to the greater and so buy the pearl of greatprice. It is discrimination which enables us to know which is the lesser valuethat has to be given up in order to obtain the greater, for there is no gainwithout sacrifice. What we do not realise is that Mystical Qabala Page 200every sacrifice should yield a substantial profit in treasure laid up in heavenwhere neither moth nor rust do corrupt; otherwise it is mere useless waste.94. We have already noted one of the correspondences assigned to Malkuth in themicrocosm. It is also said, however, that Malkuth corresponds to the feet of theDivine Man. Here again we have an important concept; for unless the feet arefirmly planted on Mother Earth, no stability is possible. There are altogethertoo many top-heavy mystics who like to think that the Divine Man ends at theneck like a cherub, and give no place to the generative organs of Yesod, or theanus of Malkuth. They need to learn the lesson that the heavenly dream taught toSt Peter, that nothing which God made is unclean unless we allow it to becomeso. We should recognise the Divine Life in all its functions, and so bring themanhood up into Godhead and sanctify it. Cleanliness is next to godliness,especially internal cleanliness. If we evade and avoid a thing, how are we tokeep it clean and wholesome? The taboos of a primitive people have beenaltogether overdone in our civilised life, with disastrous consequences to thehealth and wholesomeness of humanity.95. The symbols of Malkuth are the altar of the double cube and the equal-armedcross, or cross of the elements.96. The altar of the double cube is symbolic of the Hermetic maxim, \"As above,so below,\" and teaches that what is visible is the reflection of what isinvisible, and corresponds with it exactly. This cubical altar is the altar ofthe Mysteries, in contradistinction to the table-altar, which is the altar ofthe[Page 294]Church. For the table-altar stands in the east, but the cubical altar stands inthe centre. It is said to be in proper proportion when it is the height of thenavel of a six-foot man, and its breadth and depth are half its height.97. The equal-armed cross, or cross of the elements, represents the fourelements in balanced equilibrium, which is the perfection of Malkuth. It isrepresented on the Tree by the division of Malkuth into four quarters, colouredcitrine, olive, russet, and black, with the citrine towards Yesod and the blacktowards the Qliphoth; the olive towards Netzach and the russet towards Hod.These are the reflections of the Three Pillars and the Qliphothic sphere, dulledand tempered by the veil of earth.98. Thus are all things summed up in Malkuth, though seen in a glass darkly, byreflection, and not face to face.99. The four Tarot cards yield curious results when subjected to meditation inthe light of what we know about Malkuth. The Ten of Wands is called the Lord ofOppression; the Ten of Cups, the Lord of Perfected Success; the Ten of Swords,the Lord of Ruin; and the Ten of Pentacles, the Lord of Wealth.Mystical Qabala Page 201100. As we have already seen, it is in Malkuth that spiritual forces come totheir fulfilment on the plane of form, and by taking these completed forms, and\"sacrificing\"them, we can translate them back into spiritual potencies.101. These four Tarot cards, it will be observed, are alternately good and badin their significance; in fact, the Ten of Swords is said to be the worst cardin the pack to divination. There is a curious alchemical doctrine which has abearing on this point. It is taught that the signs of the planets are compoundedout of three symbols - the solar disk, the lunar crescent, and the cross ofcorrosion or sacrifice; and these symbols, rightly interpreted, give the key tothe alchemical nature of the planet and its practical use in the Great Work oftransmutation. For instance, Mars, in whose symbol the cross surmounts thecircle, is said to be outwardly corrosive, but inwardly solar; Venus, in whichthe circle surmount sthe cross, is said to be outwardly solar, but inwardlycorrosive, or in the words of Scripture, sweet in the mouth, butin the bellybitter.102. In these four Tarot tens the same principle is seen to prevail. Each cardrepresents the working of a certain type of spiritual force on the plane ofdense matter. The most spiritual of these cards, the ten of the suit whose aceis said to be the Root of the Powers of Fire, is called the Lord of Oppression.This reaches us that the higher spiritual forces are apt to be outwardlycorrosive when operating upon the plane of matter. The powers of Fire, at theirhighest potency in the ten of Wands, are a refining fire. \"As gold is tried inthe furnace, so the heart must be tried by pain.\"103. On the other hand, all the symbolism of the suit of Cups, or Chalices,shows the Venusian influence very clearly; it is in this suit we find the Lordsof Pleasure, Material Happiness, and Abundance. But we also find the Lords ofIllusory Success, Abandoned Success, and Loss in Pleasure, which shows clearlythat this suit, though outwardly solar, is inwardly corrosive.104. Swords, again, are under the Martian influence, and the Lord of Ruin showsthe total sacrifice of all material things.105. But in Pentacles, earth of earth, the position is again reversed, and wefind that the ten of Pentacles is the Lord of Wealth.106. It will be seen, therefore, that those cards which are of suits primarilyspiritual in nature are outwardly corrosive on the physical plane; and thosecards of suits that are primarily material in nature are outwardly solar, orbeneficient on the material plane. This teaches a very useful lesson, and givesa very important key when used in those systems of divination which are designedto give discernment of the spiritual influences operating in a case.107. All mundane affairs rise and fall like the waves of the sea, creastfollowing trough, and trough following crest in rhythmical progression;therefore, when any mundane[Page 296]Mystical Qabala Page 202condition is at either its zenith or nadir we know that a change of tide is tobe expected in the near future. This knowledge is embodied in many popularsayings, such as \"It's a long lane that has no turning,\" and \"The darkest houris before the dawn.\" Harriman, the great American millionaire, said that he madehis fortune by always buying on a falling market and selling on a risingone-which is the exact opposite to what everyone else tries to do.Nevertheless, it is a farsighted proceeding, for a boom always topples over intoa depression, and a depression issues forth into a boom. This has happened sooften even within living memory that one would have thought speculators wouldhave learnt the lessons of history, but they never do. It was a knowledge ofthis fact that enabled the Fraternity of the Inner Light to be piloted steadilyamidst the post-war difficulties, and come through without having to curtail anyof its activities. There are times when it is necessary to be modest in order tobe solvent; but there are times when one can launch out boldly, despite alloutward seeming, because one knows that the tide is rising under one.108. These four cards, then, give a very true insight into the nature of theoperation of forces in Malkuth, and when they turn up in a divination, onealways prepares for the outward gold to turn to corrosion, and the outwardcorrosion to turn to gold sooner or later, and one takes in or spreads one'ssails accordingly.109. This is the true use of divination-to enable one to discern the spiritualforces concerned in any happening, and act accordingly. Of what use, then, isthe divination performed by one who has not spiritual discernment? And can oneexpect to find spiritual discernment in the hack occultist who gives so much forhalf-a-crown, and so much more for ten shillings? Spiritual things are not donein this way. Among the ancients, divination was a religious rite, and so itshould be among us, if it is not to bring a trail of bad luck in its wake.CHAPTER XXVITHE QLIPHOTHI. In a previous chapter we have referred to the Qliphoth, the evil and averseSephiroth; the time has now come to study them in detail, even though \"these areawful forms, dangerous even to think upon.\"2. It may be asked why, since these forms are reputed to be so dangerous even tothink about, it is necessary to study them. Were it not better to turn the mindaway from them and prevent the images of such evil forces from formulating inconsciousness? In answer to this question we may cite the precepts of Abramelinthe Mage, whose system of magic is the most potent and complete that we possess.According to his system, the operator, after a prolonged period of purificationand preparation, evokes not only the angelic forces, but also the demoniac ones.Mystical Qabala Page 2033. A good many people have burnt their fingers with the system of Abramelin, andthe reason is not far to seek; for if we examine their records we find that theyhave never followed the system in its entirety, but picked out a ceremony hereand an invocation there for performance as the mood took them. ConsequentlyAbramelin's system has got a bad name as being a singularly dangerous formula;whereas, performed in its entirety, it is a singularly safe one, because itdeals with all the reactions of the invoked forces under what might be termedlaboratory conditions and neutralises them.4. Whoever attempts to work with the positive aspect of a Sephirah must rememberthat it also has a negative aspect, and unless he can maintain the necessaryequilibrium of forces, that negative aspect is liable to come uppermost andswamp the[Page 298]operation. There is a point in every magical operation when the negative aspectof the force comes up to be dealt with, and unless dealt with will lure theexperimenter into the pit which he has digged. It is a sound magical maxim notto invoke any force unless you are equipped to deal with its averse aspect.5. Dare you invoke the fiery energy of Mars (Geburah) into your nature unlessyou have sufficiently purified and disciplined yourself to be sure that you canprevent the Martian force from going to extremes and leading to cruelty anddestructiveness? If you have any insight into human nature at all, you must beaware that everyone has the faults of his qualities-that is to say, if he isvigorous and energetic he is liable to fall into cruelty and oppression; if heis calm and magnanimous he is liable to the temptations of laisse-faire andinertia.6. The Qliphoth are aptly termed the evil and averse Sephiroth, for they are notindependent principles or factors in the cosmic scheme, but the unbalanced anddestructive aspect of the Holy Stations themselves. There are, in fact, not twoTrees, but one Tree, a Qliphah being the reverse of a coin of which the obverseis a Sephirah.Whoever uses the Tree as a magical system must perforce know the Spheres of theQliphoth, because he has no option but to deal with them.7. It is only upon the plane of Atziluth that there is but one Name of Powerassociated with a Sephirab, and that is the Deity Name. To the archangelcorresponds the devil, and to the choir of angels the cohort of demons, and theSephirothic Spheres have their correspondence in the Infernal Habitations.8. The student must carefully distinguish between what the occultist callspositive and negative evil. This is a very important point in esotericphilosophy, and a failure to realise its significance leads into far-reachingpractical errors and cripples the whole life and work of the initiate, or, forthe rnatter of that, of any human being who is endeavouring to develop a modicumof free-will and self-governance. It is a point which is but little understood,but it is a singularly important point in practice, because it influences soimmediately cur outlook, judgment, and conduct.Mystical Qabala Page 2049. Positive evil is a force which is moving against the current of evolution;negative evil is simply the opposition of an inertia which has not yet beenovercome, or of a momentum which has not yet been neutralised. Let us make thesedefinitions clear by an example. The natural conservatism of a mature mind isregarded as evil by the would-be reformer; the natural iconoclasm of youth isregarded as evil by the administrator who has established his system.Nevertheless, we cannot dispense with either of these opposing factors ifsociety is to be maintained in a healthy state; between them we achieve a steadyprogress that neither disorganises society nor permits it to sink into inertiaand decay. Both these factors are indispensable to social welfare, yet either ofthem, unchecked, would lead to harm.10. We cannot consider either of them, then, as a social evil unless it isoverdone. We should therefore, in the terminology of esoteric philosophy,classify conservatism as negative evil when considered from the standpoint ofthe reformer, and iconoclasm as negative evil when considered from thestandpoint of the conservative.11. Positive evil is a different matter. It may be of the nature of aniconoclasm carried too far that descends into sheer anarchy; or of conservationcarried too far, and becoming class privilege and vested interest militatingagainst the general welfare. Or it may take the form of actual politicalcorruption, which destroys the efficiency of the administrative machine; or ofsocial corruption, such as organised prostitution or child-labour, whichundermines the health of the body politic.12. The conservative impulse and the radical impulse will both draw tothemselves those who are in sympathy with their viewpoints, and their supporterswill soon organise themselves into political parties; these parties are not evilsave in the[Page 300]prejudiced eyes of their political opponents; the main body of the nationopposes and supports them impartially and turn about, recognising that theyrepresent compensating factors. Equally, the corrupt and criminal elements insociety will tend to organise a Tammany Hall of their own. Now the Conservativeand Radical parties might be likened to Chesed and Geburah respectively; TammanyHall might be compared to the Qliphah corresponding to Geburab, the Burning andContending Forces; and the organised Diehards to the Qliphah of Chesed, thePermitters of Destruction.13. Negative evil is the practical corollary of the principle of Equilibrium.Equilibrium is the result of the balance of contending forces; consequently theymust pull one against the other. We must not make the mistake of classing one ofa pair of contending forces as good and the other as evil; to do so is to fallinto the fundamental heresy of dualism.14. The instructed and enlightened expositors of all religions regard dualism asa heresy; it is only ignorant adherents of a faith who believe in the conflictbetween light and darkness, spirit and matter, which shall eventually result inthe triumph of the god and the total abolition and elimination of all opposinginfluences. Protestant Christianity forgets Mystical Qabala Page 205that Lucifer is the Light-bearer, Satan a fallen angel, and that Our Lord didnot limit His ministrations to humanity, but descended into Hell and preached tothe spirits in prison.We cannot deal with evil by cutting it off and destroying it, but only byabsorbing and harmonising it.15. In all our calculations and conceptions we must carefully distinguishbetween the resistance of the compensating Sephirah and the influence of thecorresponding Qliphah.The two Trees, Divine and Infernal, Sephirothic and Qliphothic, are usuallyrepresented as they would appear if the obverse Tree were a reflection of theCelestial Tree in a mirror at its base, reaching downwards in proportion as theother reaches upwards. We should get a better concept if we conceived of the twoglyphs as inscribed upon either side of a sphere, so that if a pendulum swingingbetween Geburah and Gedulah (Mars and Jupiter) overreached itself in eitherdirection it would commence to circle round to the reverse side of the globe andcome into the sphere of influence of the corresponding averse Sephirab. If itswung too far towards Geburah (Severity) it would come into the Sphere of theBurning and Destroying Forces and of Hatred; if it swung too far in thedirection of Mercy it would come into the Sphere of the Permitters ofDestruction, and there is much significance in that name.16. The mystic tells us that it is his aim to work in the sphere of pure spiritwithout any alloy of earth, and therefore he calls upon the Name of God alone;but the occultist replies As long as you are in a body of earth you are a childof earth, and spirit for you cannot be without alloy. When you call upon thelove of God it cannot come to you save through a Redeemer. The Sphere of theRedeemer is Tiphareth and its archangel is Raphael, the healer, for do we notrecognise the influence of the Redeemer through its healing influence upon bodyand soul? But the reverse of the Redeemer who harmonises are the Zourmiel, theDisputers, \"the great black giants ever working against each other.\"Do we not see their influence in the harsher doctrines of Christianity, in theidea of everlasting punishment under the dominion of the Devil as contrastedwith everlasting reward under the dominion of the vengeful and venal Jehovah? Ifthese are not Dual Contending Forces, what are they? Modern religious thoughtmakes a great error in not re~ising that one can have too much of a good thing.17. The only time when there is perfect equilibrium of force is during aPralaya, a Night of the Gods. Force in equilibrium is static, potential, neverdynamic, because force in equilibrium implies two opposing forces which haveperfectly neutralised each other and thus rendered each other inert,inoperative. Upset the equilibrium, and the forces are freed for action, changecan take place; growth, evolution, organisation can occur. There is nopossibility of progress in perfect equilibrium; it is a state of rest. At theend of a[Page 302]Cosmic Night it is said that equilibrium is overset, and in consequence anoutfiowing of power takes place once more and evolution begins again.Mystical Qabala Page 20618. The equilibrium of the universe may best be likened to the swing of apendulum rather than the grip of a clamp. It is not held immobile, and there isall the difference in the world between those two concepts. For in poise thereis always a slight vibration, a push~pull between the opposing forces that holdsit steady; it is a stability, not of inertia, but of strain.19. This is represented on the Tree by the two Pillars of Mercy and Severitywhich pull against each other. Geburah (Severity) pulls against Gedulah (Mercy).Binah (Form) pulls against Chokmah (Force). If this counter-pull ceased, theuniverse would collapse, as a man who is pulling on a rope collapses if the ropebreaks. We must clearly realise that this tension, this resistance against whichwe have to strain in whatever we may be doing, is not evil; it is the necessarycounterpoise of whatever force we are employing.20. As was pointed out in a previous chapter, each Qliphah arose primarily as anemanation of unbalanced force in the course of the evolution of thecorresponding Sephirah. There was a period when the forces of Kether wereoverflowing to form Chokmah, and the Second Path was in process of becoming, butnot yet fully established; therefore Kether must have been out ofequilibrium-overflowing but not yet compensated. We see this phenomenon of thepathological transition stage clearly exhibited in the case of the adolescentwho has ceased to be a child under control, and has not yet become an adult andself-controlled.21. It was this inevitable period of unbalanced force, the pathology oftransition, that gave rise to each Qliphah in turn. It follows then that thesolution of the problem of evil and its eradication from the world is not to beachieved through its suppression, cutting off, or destruction, but through itscompensation and consequent absorption back into the Sphere whence it came. Theunbalanced force of Kether, which gave rise to the Dual Contending Forces, mustbe neutralised by a corresponding increase in the activity of Chokmah, Wisdom.22. The unbalanced force of each Sephirab then, which arose unchecked during thetemporary phases of disequilibrium that occur periodically in the course ofevolution, forms the nucleus around which were organised all the thought-formsof evil arising in the consciousness of sentient beings or through the operationof blind forces that happen to be out of equilibrium, each kind of inharmonyseeking its own place. It will follow, then, that what was at first a mereoverplus of a force, both pure and good in its intrinsic nature, may, if notcompensated, become in the course of ages a highly organised and developedcentre of positive and dynamic evil.23. An example will once again help us to make this clear. An overplus of thenecPssary energy of Mars (Geburah), the energy that budges inertia and clearsaway that which is effete and outworn, would be certain to occur during theperiod prior to the emanation of Tiphareth, the Redeemer. As soon as emanated,the Redeemer would compensate the seventies of Geburah, even as Our Lord said:\"A new law give I unto you. Ye shall no longer say, an eye for an eye and atooth for a tooth . . .\" Now this uncompensated severity of Geburah gave us thejealous God of the Old Testament and all the religious Mystical Qabala Page 207persecutions that have ever been done in His unbalanced Name. It forms theQliphah of Geburah, and every cruel and oppressive nature is in sympathy withit. To its Sphere goes all the overplus of the force thev emanate that is notabsorbed by the opposing force in the universe-all the unslaked revenge, all theunsatisfied lust of cruelty; and these forces, whenever they find a channel ofexpression opening up, nse through it. Consequently the man who gives way tocruelty soon finds that he is not merely expressing the impulses of his ownundeveloped or misshapen nature, but that a great force like a stream in spateis urging him on, driving him from one outrage to another till finally he loseshis self-control and discretion, and is swept away to self-destruction by someincautious expression of his impulses.[Page 304]24. Whenever we make ourselves the channel of any pure force, that is to say anyforce which is single and undiluted by ulterior motiv&s and secondaryconsiderations, we find that there is a river in spate behind us-the stream ofthe corresponding Sephirothic or Qliphothic forces that is finding a channelthrough us. It is this that gives the single-minded zealot his abnormal power.CHAPTER XXVIICONCLUSION1. Having ended my study of that portion of the Holy Qabalah which is concernedwith the Ten Sephiroth upon the Tree of Life, I can find no other words to saythan: \"The little done, the undone vast\".2. This book will, I hope, be followed by other books. The Twenty-two Paths forma system of mystical psychology, being concerned with the relationship betweenthe soul of man and the universe. As the Ten Sephiroth, being concerned with theMacrocosm, are the key to illumination, so are the Twenty-two Paths, beingconcerned with the relationship between Macrocosm and Microcosm, the key todivination; and divination, taken in its true sense, is spiritual diagnosis, avery different matter to fortune-telling.3. The Spheres of the gods upon the Tree is also a matter of profound interestand immediate practical application, for they give the key to the rites thatwere performed as a means, and a very effectual means, of contacting andequilibrating those different forces that are personalised under the names ofthe gods.4. All these things, however, require detailed knowledge, and that can only begot together gradually. It is more than one pen can do unaided, and I shouldwelcome the correspondence of those who are interested in these subjects, not asresearch into antiquity, but as living forces that come home to men's businessand bosoms.5. All that remains to us of ceremonial in the West is in the hands of theChurch, the Masons, and the producers of cabaret. All three are effectual aftertheir kind: the Church Mystical Qabala Page 208[Page 306]evoking love of God; Masonry evoking love of man; and cabaret evoking love ofwomen.6. Viewed as a means of invoking the spirit of God, ceremonial is puresuperstition; but viewed as a means of evoking the spirit of man, it is purepsychology, and that is how I view it. It is a lost art in the West, but an artthat is well worth reviving.7. In these pages I have given the philosophical basis on which this art rests.Its practical application depends not only upon technical knowledge; but uponthe development of certain powers in the mind by careful and prolonged training,of which the first is the power of concentration, and the second the power ofvisual imagination. It is concerning the power of the visual imagination that weare so lamentably ignorant in the West. Coue'just missed the turning when he sought in prolonged attention a substitute forspontaneous emotion.DIAGRAMSMystical Qabala Page 209Mystical Qabala Page 210[index-211_1.jpg]Mystical Qabala Page 211"},{"pageContent":"DOCUMENT OUTLINE * kether * chokmah * Binah * Chesed * Geburah * Tiphareth * The Four Lower Sepiroth * Netzach * hod * yesod * Malkuth"}]
