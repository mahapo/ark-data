Knowledge f alls into two divisions - t he record of facts and the expla nation thereof. Knowledge ca n only consist of that which is pr esent in the mind. That which does not enter the mind cannot be known. Therefore you c an only know that which you have senses to interpret to you. As new senses open up, more planes of existence can be known. There is, however, a limit to the knowledge of the finite. Perception ceases at the barrier o f manifestation. Of that which lies beyond we can only know by analogy.The Unmanifest is pure existenc e. We cannot say of It that it is Not . Although it is n ot manifest it Is. It is the source from which all aris es. It is the only `Reality ’. It alone is substance. It alone is stable. All else is a n appearance and a becoming. Of this Unmanifest we ca n only say IT IS. IT is the verb `t o be’ turned back upon itself. IT is a state of pure `being’ withou t qualities a nd without history. All we ca n say of IT is that it is not anything that we know, for if we know anything it m ust be in manifestation for us to know it, and if it is in manifestation it is not unmanifest. Therefore the very fact that we can know it proves that it is not unmanifest. The Unmanifest is the Great Negati on; at the same time it is the infinite potentiality which ha s not occurred . It is best conceived o f under the image of inter- stellar space. In the occult teachings you h ave been given cert ain images, u nder which you are instructed to think of certain things. These images are not descripti ve but symbolic, a nd are designed to train the mind, not inform it. Therefore you m ay think of the Unmanifest as inter- stellar space; and of the Logos as a Sun surrou nded by His Sol ar System of Planets and of the emanations of the Logos as Rays. The Unmanifest is the only Unity. Manifestation begins when duality occurs. The prime duality is `Sp ace’ and `Movem ent’.The first manifestation was a current in space. The metaphor I must use may convey nothing to your mi nd. All I can say is that space was moving. You will find these clues a re a clue to much. Now when space moves it h as this peculiar qu ality - being frictionless it n ever loses m omentum but continues to flow. When space moves two forces are at work: (a) The force which ca uses it to move, being the desire of space for momentum. (b) The force which ha d hitherto caused it not to move, being the desire o f space for inertia. These two factors are present in all motion, but the desire for movement, being the stronger, overcomes the desire for inertia, and the desire for inertia continues as a check upon the movement. Therefore the move ment is pulled upon slightly. That is why there is no such thing as a straight line in the Cosmos. All movement therefore has a slight curve in its projection, therefore eve ntually it returns to the spot whe nce it started, and forms a spinning ring. Now the prime movement is just a flowing of space that returns after long ae ons whence it started, and then renews its jo urney. This sets up a spinning belt of enormous circum ference. This belt spins o n one plane for immense aeons of time; spins with a c hangeless spi nning. B ut its tendency is to communicate its motion to the space about it, which le ads more space to flow into the spinning (all this, remember, is metaphor). The spinning in one plane continues until the stresses which it ge nerates evoke a new movement, and a second current in space is set up at right angles t o the first, and the same process is rep eated. These spinning planes of force may be conceived of as resembling the Rings of Saturn. We have now t wo spinning planes which, a t two poi nts cut each other, and it is worthy of note that the second plane forms outside the first and is therefore larger in d iameter. For countless a eons these planes spin at right a ngles to each other, and the whole o f evolution turns upon the difference in size between the planes. When the larger has got up to the same speed as the smaller a nd older, it commences to attract one aspect of it, the conseque nce being that the older circle is drawn t owards t he newer. Now the first circle mu st be conceived of as having an upper and a lower surface. The upper surface of the outflowing arc m ay be conceived o f as positive an d the lower as negative. The reverse b eing the case in the inflowing arc. Likewise w ith the second circle to arise. These circles are mutually attracting a nd repelling each other; so that you c onceive the upper"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"surface of the outflowing arc of the first circle, be ing positive, rising up towards its c orresponding aspect in the second circle, and the lower circle in t he returning arc pressing downwards, so that you get a second movement imparted to the spinning disc. When this secondary movement has completed its first circuit and set up its steady revolutio n, the new Cosmos is in b eing. That is the prime beginni ng of a Cosmos express ed in the nearest approxima te metaphor. The secondary spin of the first circuit is the Ring-Pass-Not, and the circuit o f the second formation is that sphere which sets a bound to Chaos. On the outer sphere there is a secondary derivation, and though a spinning circle of motion, represents for that Cosmos, the prime stillness, - th e immobility in which it is ro oted; - it is t he thrust-block of the force of the Cosmos, that which resists, which alo ne enables momentum to be achieved and you m ay call it the Ring- Chaos the prime evil. It is evolved fr om the reaction of the prime force in order to take its thrust. It spins at right angles to the prime spin. It counteracts it. It was the attraction of the Ring- Chaos inducing a secondary spin in the Ring- Cosmos which forms the Ring-Pass-Not. Now that movement in the Ring- Cosmos, spinning in o ne plane and rotating while it spins as if upon an axis, se ts the bounds beyond which the creatures of that universe c annot pass, even in thought. B ut this universe is a sphere encircled by two lines of force - the Ring- Cosmos and the Ring Cha os - rot ating at right angles to each other. The momentum of the Ring-Cosmos is the source o f force from which evolu tion draws its m omentum; and the rotation of the Ring- Chaos is the source of force from which dissolu tion draws its p ower. Evolution is a thrust from the surface towards the centre. Devolutio n, or Dissolutio n is a suction into outer space. The Ring- Chaos does not belong to the universe it encircles, b ut to outer space. That is an important point in connection with it. The Ring- Cosmos has its desires tur ned towards t he sphere it encircles. The Ring- Chaos has its desires turned towards th e space that encircles it. The Ring- Cosmos seeks to extend the centre. The Ring- Chaos seeks to expand the circumference. The Ring- Cosmos tends to solidify by contraction. The Ring- Chaos to return to the Unmanifest, whe nce it arose, and therefore, if its influence were un checked, to reduce the universe it e ncircles to nothingness. The Ring- Cosmos, if its influence were u nchecked, would be static in the immediate present. These two influences are the source of all the force in the Cosmos - The Ring- Cosmos because it concretes - builds up. The Ring- Chaos because it diffuses - never g rows. Now these two Rings we will call Go od and Evil; Life and Death; Light and Darkness; Spirit a nd Matter; Being and Not-Being; G od and Devil; because each of these potencies h as its root in its res pective Ring. But let it be clearly conceived t hat the Ring “Go od” and the Ring “Evil” are not good and evil as you understand them, but merely spinning circles o f force at right angles to each other, and therefore in opposition, and it is merely the angle of the first to arise which is calle d “good” a nd the angle in opposition to the prime plane is calle d “evil” and it might well be that in another Cosmos the first plane would begin to spin at another angle - the angle o f your ”ev il”, it would still be ”good” t o its Cosmos, because “goo d” and “evil” do not depend upon any plane or angle, b ut are simply relative to each other. The first force to arise is called “good” because, from it arises t he line of force called evoluti on. All subsequ ent secondary forces are measured by that standard. In so far as they move in the same"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"angle they are recko ned to be ”good”. I n so far as they approach to a right angle they are reckoned to be in opposition and are called “evil”. Evil is simply that which is moving in the opposite directi on to evoluti on. Evil is that which approaches the plane of movement of the Ring-Chaos and therefore tends to revert to the Unmanifest. All evil that builds up with a universe is a ttracted towards th e Ring- Chaos and is sel f- destroyed, because the very name ”evil” means a force which tends to non-existenc e. So you c an conceive of evil under two aspects:- (a) That which e nables you t o lock up the forces of good by opposition, and so secure s tability - a foot-hold. Evil enables you to get a purchase on space. (b) Evil, if allowed t o function unopposed, is the `Scavenger of the Gods’ therefore said the Great One, our Master, “resist not evil”. When you resist evil you lock up good. You lock up the force of good which h olds the evil inert. This serves no useful purpose, unless you h ave a superabundance of good which shall sta nd upon the platform thus formed and leap up from it to greater heights . Therefore it is not enough to meet hate with love - evil with goo d. This is the course of the ignoran t and the reason why exoteric relig ion has made so little im pressio n in the world. You must hate with ha te sufficiently to cause a locking up of the force. You must hate the hate and, having rendered evil inert by op position, the love ca n take its stand upon the firm platform and use it as a thrust-block . Therefore you o nly oppose evil when you wi sh to do construc tive work - when you wish to make something new. You never oppose the evil when you w ish to destroy. You make a vacuum round it. You prevent opposition from touching it. Then, being unopposed, it is free to follow the law of its own nature, which is, t o join the motion of the Ring- Chaos. It, therefore, passes out to the periphery of the universe un til it meets the spin of the Ring-Pass-Not which it cannot get through, but it has gone to a place of such primitive simplicity that it is resolved into its own el ements, and these elements are drawn into the attraction of the nearest motion, which is th e nature of the Ring- Cosmos, which is th e nature of good. Therefore evil, when unopposed, resolves itsel f into the undifferentiated raw material of existenc e - the first form of manifestation. It ceases to be organised. It ceases to have qualities . It starts a fresh at the beginning, tra nsmuted through n eutrality into good. It is the spin of these two Rings which gi ve the influences that play upon creation. You are now in a position to know why the mystery of evil is the secret of the initiates, because when you u nderstand evil it is exceedingly useful. But the undisciplined man, if he knew the usefulness and goodness of evil, would use it dynamically on the positive side of its manifestation, not statically by availing himself of its negative qualities a s does the Initiate. You see, it is a matter of geometry. That is why numbers ar e so important, and remember, numbers in occultism refer to the degrees o f angles. The degrees of the numbers of White occultism ar e marked in the Ring-Cosm os. The degrees o f the numbers of evil are marked in the Ring- Chaos. Always think of the number in referring to the degree o f an angle of two intersecti ng lines of force, and remember that when you op erate on more than one plane you get the angles o f the intersecti ng of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the planes. You will have mor e instruction about that. Every plane has three Rings, like t he Cosmos. Also you can get intersections between different types o f movement like Time and Space. These things will be studied later. Chapter II. The First Trinity. You have found, no doubt, that the teaching is abstruse and unfamiliar. Believe me it is more difficult to give than to receive, for that which is d escribe d so greatly transcends the condition upon which la nguage has been built up, that the very images h ave to be built in your consciousness before they can be evoked by any sp oken word. You have to conceive o f the Cosmos, in its primal aspect, as consisting of three spinning movements. All that is nothing but movement - movement in space - pure movement. For the prime movement which g ives rise to all that is, commences before there is a nything to move. The Cosmos then, is bounded by that movement which is called the Ring-Pass-Not. But besides the Ring-Pass-Not there are move ments in two directions. There are the Ring Cos mos and Chaos - goo d and evil, an d they are the sources o f the forces which are known to you by these names. But though these forces influence that which is within th e Ring- Pass-Not, they cannot pass beyond it. These three Rings are the three `prim aries’ of the Cosmos - the first Trinity, that is why the Supreme Being is always conceived o f as a Trinity; and three is the fundamental number. Every thing in the end is reducible to these three influences. Whatever subsequ ent stresses arise m ay be analysed into the balancing o f these three forces:- (a) The force of the Ring- Cosmos which tends towards the centre. (b) The force of the Ring- Chaos which tends towards o uter space. (c) The force of the Ring-Pass-Not which holds the balance between them and prevents either of these forces from going to extremes. The Ring- Pass-Not, however, is derived f rom the Ring Cosmos and therefore partakes of its nature rather than of that of the Ring- Chaos. The Ring- Chaos must always be thought of as having its affinity with th e outer space of the Unmanifest, and a tendency to return to unmanifestation. It looks towards the past, and ever se eks the conditions of the past. The Ring- Cosmos endeavours to focus, as the Ring- Chaos endeavours t o diffuse. The tendency of the Ring- Cosmos is t owards th e future. The Ring- Chaos can never buil d anything, b ecause whatever forces it may originate diffuse, unconfined, into outer space, but the Ring-Cosm os, in conjunction with th e Ring- Pass- Not conserve its forces. For t he forces which the Ring-Cosmos radiated into that space within its circu mference cannot pass out again b ecause they are confined by the influences of the Ring-Pass-Not. Therefore they act and interact among themselves producing ever great er and great er elaboration of influences. Let us now return to the point in Time when t he Ring- Pass-Not h ad completed its first revolutio n and the Cosmos is in being. Any form of force, when it has reached the maximum momentum of its type of movement, gives rise t o the secondary movements which serve to carry off the excess of force which it is generating, f or force begets force when m oving under frictionless c onditions. The prime activity is MOV EMENT ."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The secondary activity is LIGHT. The third activity is SOUND. The movement of the Ring-Cosmos sets up secondary swirls within th e area of its influence, its tendency is to draw more and more space into its spin . It cannot extend itself externally because it is limit ed by the sphere of the Ring- Pass-Not, it therefore extends itself internally, so that the spinning b elt finally becomes a spinning disc with the centre immobile. The spinning disc, being rotated by the secondary movement, which is the Ring-Pass-Not, becomes the spinning sphere. The interaction of the two f orms of movement is naturally neutralising, conseque ntly there is a break-up of the simple m ovement of the disc i nto a series of compromises. The chief point of activity ceases to be the circumference and becomes the centre. Although the Ring- Cosmos, the Ring- Chaos and the Ring- Pass-Not e ach continue on one plane, and spin in their own place, the synth esis of their movements give rise to a series of revolving radii. These radii are the Rays. You must conceive o f them as a series of spinning rings linking ce ntre to circumference and see:- (a) The influence of the Ring- Chaos in the force which c auses the out-going curre nt to flow towards th e periphery. (b) The influence of the Ring- Cosmos in the force which causes the current to flow towards t he centre. (c) The centre is the synth esis of all the forces and the balancing of them. It will be perceived t hen that upon the Cosmic plane the Rays give rise to the Central Sun. We have now arri ved at a point when, i n addition to the three great `prim aries’, which are strictly external to the Cosmos they have genera ted, we have a purely Cosmic m ovement, the movement of the flowing Rays, the Rays that flow out and return. Now these Rays, th ese circular Rays, which ar e reflected back from the Ring-Pass-Not, must be thought of in pairs, each one being in special ass ociation with its opposite number, so that the true movement is a figure of eight, the out-going fl ow being ab ove in o ne half of the circle, a nd below in the opposite half. Herein is a very deep truth closely related to practical occultism . These new movements set up stresses among themselves which gi ve rise to a series o f concentric rings of movement, so that the Cosmos becomes divided up into segments of influence. The movements of the spinning Rays and the concentric circles are known as the `Gre at Secondaries’. There are twelve Rays and seven concentric circles. Within the segm ents are set up the move ments which ar e known as `Tangentials’. The nearest analogy to these is the Brownian move ment of atoms. The intersecting o f the Rings an d the Rays giving rise to angles, an d the sharp tangential movement thus occasioned introduces a new factor into the Cosmos. You now perceive that we have studied three types of movement: (a) The interaction of the primal Rings. (b) The interaction of the secondary Rays and Circles. (c) The Tangential move ments occasioned by the opposition o f"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the angles a nd the secondaries. In these tangential movements the lines of force are continually crossing ea ch other’s paths, being confined to small segments of the Cosmos. Where they cross t he Vortex is set up by the opposing influences modifying each others ac tions. There, instead of proceeding in t hese slight curves, which g ive rise to enormous circles, they are deflected into a new movement and gyrating about each other become relativel y static, thus setting up a composite unit - two f orces which no longer ar e influenced independently by the attractions of greater forces, but are influenced together. Thus are atoms formed. Two intersecti ng forces setting up a vortex and gyrating a bout each other, instead of circling the limits o f the Cosmos. I have describe d the formation of the `prim e atom’. These atoms, acting as units likew ise perceive the attraction of the units about them and begin to move in their turn, and the same process occ urs again. Atoms in m ovement meet and gyrate and so the process is co ntinued. The tendency of the Composite atoms is to travel towards t he periphery, and of the simple atoms to remain near the centre. It is thus that the planes of Cosmic ma tter are develop ed. So that, to recapitulate., we have:- 1. The primary movement of the Rings. 2. The secondary movement of the Rays. 3. The tertiary movement of the tangentials wi thin the segments. 4. The quaternary movement of the vortices. 5. The quintecular m ovement of the composite atoms. You will meet these numbers again . One refers to The Absolute. Two “ “ The Manifest. Three “ “ Evoluti on. Four “ “ Form. Five “ “ Life. Chapter III. The Building of the Atom. You have had described to you the types o f movement which ma ke up the Cosmos. The primary Rings, t he Rays and the secondary Circles. Now these are the basis of a Cosmos, and their influences are the underlying influences of that Cosmos. Their revolution, it is, which ma ke the great cycles th e days and nights o f manifestation. A Day being the time when an aspect of the Cosmos is within what you would call, t he positive area of the magnetic field generated by the spinning Rings; and the Night whe n it is in t he negative area. By a knowledge of these Cosmic Tides the `illuminated’ may avail hi mself of their forces, hence the power o f a knowledge of the Numbers o f the Secret Calendar. These then are the primary influences; they may b e thought of as the framework of the Cosmos. The Tangential forces, within the segm ents of their interaction, set up vortices, and these vortices are the primal atoms. You may perc eive that in the building of an atom the same laws are at work as enabled the Ring-Cosm os and the Ring- Chaos to build the Cosmos. It is the law of the opposing forces which pro duce stability. The opposing forces, having produced atoms, the atoms themselves be come forces, because they move in t heir turn, and so different types o f Tangential re actions occur; move ments influenced by more than one attraction. So that, from the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"simple right-angled movement, produced by a single o pposing force, vortices ar e describe d of a polyhedronal type. You can see the material form of such reaction in the different types of crystals to which t hey give rise upon your pl ane. So that you w ill get atoms, the Tangential p ath of whose component forces can be anything from a three sided figure upwards. You must realise clearly that the primal atom consists of two op posing movements which gyrate about each other. These are simply vortices, but the vortices c an move through s pace as a water-spout can move over the ocean, and these vortices c an be induced to assume a secondary movement. It is these secondary movements which I refer to as being of an angular path. So you wi ll get the different types of atom, which is merely a spinning to the spinning at om, which moves in a triangle; the type which m akes a square; the type which describes a five sided figure; and a six sided figure etc. These atoms attract each other, and can draw together and adhere to each other by means of what, metaphorically speaking, I will call the facets of their orbits. Thereby they can form alliances among themselves. Thus different types o f atoms aris e in the Cosmos and begin to gather themselves together into composite bodies. Each composite body, as it increas es in size incre ases als o its power of attraction, so that the tendency of the Cosmos is t o aggregation, and the aggregates form adjustments amongst themselves so t hat new forces arise periodically. These we shall consider in their turn. You will perceive that we have now describe d, in addition to the great Ring forces of the Cosmos, the formation of an infinite number of minute centres of stability of varying types, and the continued orga nisation of the reactions among these centres. You will perceive that great phases would be gone through i n the course o f this evolutio n, for each new force that arose had to radiate out through the entire Cosmos until turned back in its course by th e Ring- Pass-Not, a nd it would o nly be after it had returned from whenc e it arose, and so completed its circle, t hat it could become a constant influence with the Cosmos. Within the limits o f the Rays and the Circles the newly built atoms would c annon and rebound for aeons before any co- ordination would be induced among them. But as chance would govern th e occurrenc e of two or more moving parallel t o each other, where t his occurred t heir forces would rei nforce each other and draw yet more into the orbit of their activity, so that the mere rebound would gi ve place to the ordered recurrence of influences, a nd therefore to definite paths. There are already worked out in the Cosmos the grea t lines o f force which we call th e Rays, an d the curren ts of the Rays would gradually influence the great oceans of rebounding at oms to flow in their track. So that gradually the unco-ordinated forces are co- ordinated into the great ti des of the Cosmos, and through meeting their own tangential action, move also with the grea t tides. I am now going to put before you a c oncept which may seem strange to you, bu t which is t he basis of much in practical occultism . At the beginni ng of these teachings I said to you ”space moved”. W henever a movement has occurred in space the flowing action thus set up remains. Space, when s et in motion,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"never stops flowing because it is frictionless. A force has been generated which re mains. This force may b e blended with other forces, so that for all prac tical pur poses it ce ases to be a separate unit, yet it still retains its original character, and, could you a nalyse th e unit of which it f orms a part, you would f ind it there intact. Remember this point, - space, set in motion, flows for ever. Thus supposing, m etaphorically speaking, you m ove your pen across t he paper one inch, that movement would gi ve rise t o a curren t in space which would flow in its positive form in one aspect of the movement, and return in its negative form in its other aspect. That would rem ain, and whoso ever could discern that movement in space, could discern the action which gave rise to it. This is the basis of memory, and this is the reason that it is easier to repeat a movement which ha s been performed before, and the more often it has been performed the easier is the repetition, because the momentum of space is cumulative and will avail to carry the movement in its current . You will find this explains m uch. You have had spread before you a Cosmos which ar ose out of space through move ment, and which is move ment and nothing else; you h ave seen how the stresses of forces genera ted by these move ments have given rise t o an infinite number of vortices, b uilt upon exactly the same principle a s the Great Vortex which is th e Cosmos, because the same laws hold good upon every scale of manifestation, being laws of relationship. You will then see that relationship occ urs between the new centres of force thus built, and they tend to form new Cosmoi among themselves, b uilt upon the same principles . Dances of atoms give rise t o new Rings- Cosmos and the story begins ag ain. But these new universes, as they are called, while th ey have the same laws as the Cosmos before describe d, are also influenced by th at framework of the Cosmos which was built before they began, and you will find that this law holds good throughout all m anifestation. Chapter IV. The Evoluti on of the Atom. We will recapitulate the teaching in rel ation the Rays, the Circles and the Vortices. The Rays and the Circles ar e part of the primary movement of the Cosmos. These, together with the Rings, re main constant in the Cosmos and are referred to as the Cosmic currents. The Vortices are of another nature. The primary movements are circular , the Vortices st art as s traight movements which, e ncountering opposition, assume a secondary circular movement. There is therefore always a pair of forces concerned in the creation of the primal atom, and this fundamental duality extends into all combinations of which the atom is the base. You will observe th at whenever a particular sequ ence or series of units occur in the rhythmic al functioning of a movement, that this series acts as the conditioning frame of whatever subsequent elaborations and combinations may be built up upon that foundation. For instance supposing a prime movement of an atom to be a three-side d tangential, A to B, B to C, and C back to A; whatever sec ondary movements may arise (a nd remember this, that movement in a straight line is never ma intained after the original im pulse dies away ) conflicting f orces reduce it to a"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"modification of the primal circular , so that the atom, which in its movement originally pursued a triangular course, will finally arrive at a movement consisting of three spirals arranged in a triangle. Each spiral move ment will be execut ed under the conditions governing the A _ B segment, then the B - C s egment, then the C - A segment. Therefore, if you kn ew what t he influences were, you would k now the nature of the primary movement underlying the spiral which ap pears only to the superficial observer. This is the principle underlying Astrology, and this is the reason why the Science of Numbers plays an important part in all pr actical a pplicati ons of Cosmic principles. The prime movement of an atom is a Vortex - nothing else, a mere spinning ro und a core of motionless vacu um. The atom you h ave seen describe d is not a prime atom but an elaborate and complex structure. It is only when the prime atoms combine together that such secondary movements are set up. Now an atom which is o f a triangular s tructure , can form units with as many other atoms as it has facets. When each facet has become attached to an atom the grou p is complete and has attained a state of equilibrium of stress within itsel f. It can no longer grow by accr etion but must act as an unit, and can only enter into association with other units of like type whose angles o f stress ar e similar . The prime atom, as I have said, is a simple vortex, and the composite atoms of different types arise according to the number of tangential angles into which the circums tances of counter influences may draw the vortices. The vortices, b e it noted, first arise in the angles where th e Rays converge upon the central stillness. It is the close juxtaposition of forces which se t up the secondary currents. Therefore in the sphere which surro unds the central stillness are to be found the primal atoms. These however soon take on the secondary tangential movement and thus form alliances among themselves, a s before describe d. As you have a lready been told, in addition to the movement of the Rays there is the movement of the Circles about the Central S un. This movement gives rise to centrifugal action, and the atoms tend to swing out towards th e periphery. The more complex the atom the more strongly will it feel the centrifugal action, so that you wi ll find that the Circles contain atoms of gradually increasing co mplexity as they succeed one another. These atoms, arising in t he angles o f the Rays, when they feel the influence of the centrifugal force, go out along the line of a Ray. Each atom then, has in itself forces of two Rays which s et up the primal vortex and then goes o ut along the path of one of these Rays. Evolution upon the Cosmic pl anes may f irst be observed as the gradual filling of the circle of space with atoms; infinite aeons passing in t he process. Thus the prime atoms occupy circle On e. The first form of composites - circle Two; combinations of these composites - circle Three and so on. Now these types of matter, which we may call them, are thus spread in concentric s pheres throughout the Cosmos, out to the limit of the Ring- Pass-Not, going o ut along the lines of the Rays, so that while the first circle co ntains only atoms of its own type , each succeeding circ le has in its atom, interatomic movements representative of each of the inner circles. The"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"construc tion of the outermost atoms being ver y elaborate. When the atoms reach the outermost sphere a fresh force sets in; they have encountered the opposition of the Ring- Pass- Not. I may say in parenthesis, that the atoms of each plane form units among themselves by aggre gation, thus an atom, shall we say, of the 3rd plane or circle ( th ey are the same thing in other words, `circle’ is usually reserved f or the Cosmic) f orms union by means of its facets. Anything from a triangular figure upwards of its aggregate atoms, in exactly the same way as previously describe d in regard to the primal atoms. Therefore the atoms in the outermost circle are an exceedi ngly complex system of movements within move ments. Having gone out from the central stilln ess with a centrifugal force, they are now rebuffed by the Ring-Pass-Not, and, owing to the rebuff, return with a s piral movement. This it is which le nds its peculiar formation to the Rays. Having reached the centre they then speed outwards w ith a straight c entrifugal m otion along the line of the opposite Ray to the one by which they entered the centre, to return again in the same way, but at a slightl y different angle, which will cause them, upon the next outgoing path, to follow the next Ray to the preceding one, and so they work their wa y round the circle. W hen repulsed by th e Ring- Pass-Not, they make a circular m ovement upon the plane of the outermost circle, t hus feeling its f orces from all angles. They repeat this movement upon each plane as they return. Now as you h ave alre ady been told, each move ment in space continues as a movement, therefore every influence that plays upon these atoms is registered in the reaction of stresses within th eir structure, so that each atom returns to the central stillness infinitely more complex after each journey; each Ray, intersecti ng the circles at a different angle, causes the atom travelling upon its path, to experience different influences on its journey, therefore the final complexit y of these atoms, when the complete circuit h as been describe d, though it is capable of mathematical expression cannot be conveyed by th e finite intellect. But could you grasp t he geometry of these planes, could you know their numerical calc ulus, you would h old the key to the universe. These structures are still referred to as atoms, not, as in the case of chemistry , on the hypothesis that they cannot be resolved into any sim pler structure, being ho mogeneous, but on the basis that, though composite, when once formed they cannot be resolved at all, but are permanent units. It will thus be seen that the flowing out of the atoms to the circu mference and their ret urn to the circle m arks a phase of evoluti on of the Cosmos. And the completion of the circuit o f the Rays by an atom marks a phase of evoluti on of that atom. When it has completed this circuit it h as experience d all the forces that the Cosmos can offer it, and when all the atoms evolved have c ompleted the circuit (an d the evolution of atoms upon such tide is limit ed, because after a certain pr oportion o f force has taken up a tangential form a state of equilibrium is re ached within t he Cosmos) evolution proceeds from the first movement to a state of uncompensated force until equilibrium is reached - this is t he completion of an evolu tion - a state of equilibr ium, and therefore a relative stillness. You will observe th at we have now describ ed three phases of Cosmic evolutio n. The development of the Rings was the first"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"phase. They gave rise to each other, and acted and reacted on each other till a state of equilibrium was reached. Then, though they were sta tic in relation to each other, that is to say though in constant movement within themselves, they maintained their rela tionship constant towards each other and must continue ever so to do since there is nothing to disturb them. The Vortices, set up by the movements, however, give rise to secondary movements - the Rays and the Circles - and these, starting upon their respective co urses d evelope d them until they also became static in relation to each other, and a second stage of evolutio n was passed through. These likewise in t heir turn, gave rise to the tertial movements which built the atoms. It will thus be seen that a phase of development is succeeded by a phase of equilibrium during which th at which h as been develope d is maintained, but nothing becomes, its status is unchanged. These stages m ay be known to you under the names of the Days and Nights o f Brahma - the Day of evolutio n - the Night o f static bal ance - and then the overco ming of one set of forces by an other, which causes the balance slowly to dip into manifestation again. The equilibr ium is then over, and new forces are set going. These forces are based upon the relationships of the units previously built up and are influenced by these prime determinants - the Rings, the Rays and the Circles. Within these limits, and subject to the nature of the units upon which t hey act, they form fresh combinations, permutations, and rhythm s of action and reaction, until the new forces have found their equilibrium; and in their utmost completion and development when the final combination has been achieved, they again become static in t he Cosmic balance until such period as the balance may again be overset. The overset ting of the balance is due to the same forces as set up the primal Rings - the fact that movement generated movement and sets up a sphere of swirl outside its own pa th. That is why , though every fresh set of forces set in movement must attain to a final equilibrium d etermined by the factors of their natures, suc h an equilibriu m being only a maintaining o f position of movements rela tive one to another being therefore a relative stilln ess, must always overbalance and fly out into a new phase of evoluti on because it is a C osmos and built of movement - movement generates movement. Chapter V. The Genesis of a Solar Syste m. You have got , I think, a clear concept of what h as been called the framework of the Cosmos - the Rings, th e Rays and the Circles. These having long since completed their evolutio n, have set tled down to a static c ondition, the only change which occurs be ing that of the Ring- Cosmos passing through the positive and negative spheres of influences - four to the cycle. These make great phases - the phase when t he constructive influence is in tensified, and the phase whe n the destructive influence is in tensified. The Circles a nd the Rays flow steadily in their orbits, but when t he positive phase is in being the outgoing curre nts are speeded up, and when the negative phase is in being the incoming curre nts are speeded up. The great Rings - three in number - are the primal Trinity, known t o you as the `Absolute’ though the implicatio n of the word Absolute is known to few. That is to say, the term Absolute has been used by Masters in teaching p upils wi thout the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"pupils re alising its f ull import. Because there are three Rings the `Absolute’ is a triune force. These three, operating together with an indisolu ble interactio n, are the Three which are One and the One which is Three. Refer the terms of the Athanasian Creed to this Trinity and you will grasp the meaning of the Initiate who dic tated it. The Rays form together a complex system which wi ll be referred to under the name Zodiac. The Circles are the Cosmic planes. The Central Sun is that point in space which would b e reached if the line from the sun of your system were drawn to the star known as `Alp ha Centauri’ and thence projected. You have seen how th e atoms arise - as vortices in t he angles o f the Rays. Ho w, in their sim ple form, they remain upon the first of the Cosmic planes wherein they originated. When, however, they form alliances among themselves and become composite, their weight, metaphorically speaking, t hat is to say, their susceptibility to influences is increas ed, and susceptibility to influences is all that weight is esoterically . That fact forms the basis of levitation and flight through space. Cut off your influences and you ca n move freely. When the atoms become composite centrifugal forces drive them outwards, a nd, finding the path of the flowing Rays, they proceed by th ese as being the lines of least resista nce. When they reach the next Circle they remain there, having found their level of gravity. Then presently their composite atoms form associati ons and are again swung out by the path of a Ray. Therefore, you wi ll see that it is only when the extremely elaborate atoms of the 7th Circle form allianc es that they start back up the spiral to the Central Sun. You have heard how these atoms, in their journeyings, progress up and down the Rays, for they are too highly evolved, too composite to be allowed t o remain upon any pla ne. When an atom, however, has completed the circuit o f the Rays and seeks to start out again it finds its place taken by the atoms of later develo pment. It cannot enter that stress for it is f ull, it must therefore remain in the Central S tillness. N o atom goes twice aro und the Circuit, t herefore the Central Stillness grows as evolutio n proceeds, and those atoms which h ave come home rest from their pilgr image. And when the last atom has come home the whole cre ation sinks t o sleep, and the Cosmic ti des set inwards as the Ring- Cosmos swings to its negative ph ase. Meanwhile the Rays flow and return, and the Circles swin g on their path, but the atoms stir not, though each within itself contains an infinitude of balanced movement. When, however, the Ring- Cosmos passes in to its new phase fresh attractions flow towards t he periphery. Now the influence of the Ring- Cosmos and the Ring- Chaos must be clearly understood. When the influence of the Ring- Chaos predominates there is a n unbalancing force; that is to say, the Ring-Chaos is in its positive plane; and when the influence of the Ring-Cosm os predominates there is a compensating of force, it atones for the excessive f orce of Chaos. Now Chaos calls ou twards into space. Cosmos balances and compensates until a static condition is pro duced. We have seen that the first phase of atomic evoluti on has concluded with all the atoms evolved to their utmost complexity, withdrawn from the outer circles, a nd clustered round the Central Sun. The Ring Cosmos has done its work. All is balanced, static and sleeps. But as the cycle revolves the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Ring-Chaos has its turn and it oversets t he balance which h as been achieved, and the most composite of the atoms feel first the centrifugal forces urging them and yet agai n seek to come forth. So the great u nits come out once more, down the lines of the Rays, but they proceed, not now through empty space, but each circle is populated by these atoms of different degre es of complexity whose relative specific grav ity holds them at that distance from the Central Stillness. These composite organis ms, finding themselves thus surrounded by inferior organis ms, draw them about themselves by the force of their whi rling revolution, and thus, as they progress outward, e ach becomes surrounded by a sphere of the matter of each plane which it c arries with it. Now the great orga nisms, which c ome forth are built up around the prime atoms of different tangential angles, a nd these, according to their numerical c ompositions, differ in size and also weight, a nd therefore find their appropria te bourn on different planes or Circles where th ey are held by their relative specific gravity. The Rays can carry them no further. The first phase of atomic evol ution was ess entially concerned with the Rays, but in the second going f orth with the great organisms , the Circles have their phases, and these grea t organisms d o not go out and back, but revolve with th e Circles, each in its appointed track. Therefore evoluti on has now built up, in addition to the primal statics - th e Rings, t he Rays and the Circles - two mo re sets of statics - th e atoms, each in its plane according to type, that, owing to their nature, have settled down, having found their specific position; and the great organisms , which have als o settled down, e ach to its radius of movement. The atoms move tangentially among themselves, a nd the great orga nisms revol ve around the Central Sun, passing through the influence of the Rays as they revolve. These, therefore, are relatively static, subject only to the cyclic changes pr oduced by the phases of the Rings, and the influences of the Rays as they pass through t hem. Each of these great organisms can attract to itself as much of the matter of each plane that it passes through on its way out at the beginning o f the second phase of its evolu tion as it can hold by the attraction of its mass, and it can pass out as far as the momentum of its mass can take it from the Central Sun. Therefore its position is d etermined by the angles o f the facets of the primal atom upon which it was built. That is to say, if the Vortex set up in the angle of the Rays moved in a three-sid ed path it could go no further than the first plane beyond the Central Stillness , it would h ave to be a ten-sided figure to reach the sevent h plane. You will thus see that each of these great orga nisms h as for its key the number of the angles in t he path of the original vortex which gives rise to it. This forms its limit and determines the circum ference of its influence. This, it is, which determines its Ring- Pass-Not. We have therefore develope d a number of great orga nisms, which be ing expose d to the influence of the Rings, the Rays and the Circles, themselves develo p upon similar lin es. That is to say, each of these aggregates of atoms sort themselves ou t according to the nature of the atoms composing th em; and these atoms having develo ped under their prime influences, and having those influences established in their natures by the action and interaction they set up, form miniatures of the Great Cosmos, and these grea t organis ms, these, that is to say, which are of the seventh plane, are known un to you as Solar Syste ms."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"That, in brief outline, is the history of the genesis of a solar syste m, and of solar systems in general - of your own in particular . There are many other solar systems upon the seventh plane besides your own. Some of them are known to you as the stars, but the few you know are but an infinitesimal fraction of those, even of your own plane, which you d o not know; an d there are others upon other planes which ar e not perceptible to you in your pres ent phase of evolutio n. You will perceive that each phase of evolution gives rise to a grand unity, which is a unit, though complex. First, the system of the Rings - wh ich is the `Absolute’. Then the system of the Rays and Circles, which is t he Cosmos. Then the Cosmic atoms, according to their planes. Then the great orga nisms, which we w ill call the universes, also according to their planes. You have then, you s ee, the numerical series. I f you will number them you will see how the numbers run . The universes, or solar systems are of the fourth Cosmic phase of evoluti on. Now these universes undergo in ternal evol ution upon the same lines a s the Cosmos, and these phases of internal evolution continue until they also become static within themselves, and their composite atoms flow into the Central S un, each of its own system , and rest there. Then, when o nce again t he influences of the Ring- Chaos break up the Cosmic balances, the great organisms , develo ped in each solar system , go forth and burst through the Ring- Pass-Not of that solar system and, as satellites, circle round it. Whereupon, the solar system which u nderwent disintegration, starts once again a new ph ase of its evolutio n, whos e units are the composite atoms evol ved in its p revious evolutio n; passes again through all t he phases of evolution, and again flings off the `star se ed’. Meanwhile these grea t organisms , which are first scattered, are repeating the process, e ach in its turn, so that the solar systems become, in their turn, Cosmoi to those great organisations to which they gave birth; and so this process, which I wi ll call the stellar evolutio n, goes on until a static condition is re ached among the great organisms a nd their progeny; and then, the influences of the Ring-Pass-Not , coming into action, a great system is sent back to the Central Stillness t o come again forth when the influences of the Ring- Chaos call them out; and such process continues until suc h time as the organisation of the Cosmos becomes so mighty in the force it has genera ted, that it bursts the Ring- Pass-Not, and the great organisms rush forth into the Unmanifest, and by their swirling movement gather s pace about them, and, in their turn build new Cosmoi. Such is the history of a Cosmic evol ution. You will perceive that each plane of evolution begets an organised syste m of systems of forces. These forces react to all influences that play upon them, and register the reaction in the movements of the space that is under their influence. They are therefore sentient because they react and register t he reaction; and because they register t he reaction they develop through experie nce so that even the three primal Rings are sentient influences, capable of development But they are so vast, t hese Rings, a nd so simple,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"because the influences which act upon them are so few, that their individuality , though it excee ds the span of all imaginatio n, is exce edingly primitive. Yet it is u pon this vast and simple type t hat your individuality is built up. Therefore it is that you, s mall as you are , have your a ffinities with these Cosmic Beings and are influenced by their phases from the Absolute down to the atom of your own Earth, which is t he Secret Wisdom. For the uninitiated man is acted upon by these forces, but the initiat e, by his k nowledge, escapes from their influence and uses them for his own ends. Should his ends be those of the Cosmic evolutio n he grows and develops through all its p hases till he attains that static condition which is c ompleteness, and, following the laws of the great organisms of which h e is now one, he gives rise hi mself to a system . Chapter VI. Cosmic Influences on a Solar Syste m. You have duly received the first part of the work. Your minds need to be thoroughly imbued with th ese principles i n order that you may un derstand what is t o follow. I will briefly recapitulate. Motion in space is t he prime. When its circuit is co ncluded it forms the Ring- Cosmos; which gi ves rise to the Ring- Chaos; which, by its secondary influence, causes the Ring- Cosmos to form the Ring- Pass-Not. This is the Three or Trinity. The inflowing influences, converging upon the centre, and radiating to the periphery are the Rays - the twelve. The motion of the Cosmos gives rise to the seven - the bands or planes. The converging angles o f the Rays give rise to the Tangential motions. These, when in opposition, give rise to the Atoms. The Atoms, moving in their tur n along the paths of differing angularity , form the complex atoms, which centrifugal force sorts out upon their pla nes. These finally, in the outermost plane, when they combine again, not being able to go any further, return to the centre. These are called the journeying atoms. The others are the static atoms, because they have settled down. So that you have i n the Central Stillness, no atoms but only the Primal Forc es. Upon the 1st plane you h ave atoms whose p ath is a triangular one; therefore the Number u pon this plane is based upon 3; the simplest atom presents three aspects, and the most complex is a multiple of three. The atoms of the 2nd plane have 4 for their Nu mber, and the 3rd plane have 5, the 4th plane 6, and so on, down to the 7th which has 9. These are referred to as the Secondary Numbers, whereas t he number of the Cosmic Forces are the Primary Numbers. You have then, as Primaries 1, 3, 7 and 12; and as Secondaries 3 to 9 inclusive. The Prime Tertiary is 10. Ten is the number of evolution, because it is the atoms of ten angles t hat evolve. You will perceive from the foregoing that the Primaries give rise t o each other and have settled down t o stability, cycle following cycle in orderly progression. They have completed their course, and have a chieved the maxim um complexit y of which th ey are capable. Un der the influence of their"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"changing phases the secondary movements pursue their courses. The secondary movements obey the laws of their own natures, subject to the laws and conditions of the primaries. Likewise with the Tertiaries, each plane of existenc e pursues its co urse, subject to the influences of that phase which ga ve rise to it. For example the Ring- Cosmos passes through its positive and negative phases. The Rays therefore, are sometimes flowing faster upon the negative, and outgoing arc, when the negative phase of the Ring- Cosmos is prevailin g upon their segm ent; and sometimes the inflowing, or p ositive aspect, is s peeded up as their segm ent of the universe is c overed by the positive phase of the movement of the Ring- Pass-Not. Each segment of a Ray is influenced by the Circle in whose area it lies. Therefore it will be seen that a Journeying Atom will be subject at a given mo ment, to the influence of the Ray upon which it is travelling - to the position upon that Ray, whether upon the outflowing or inflowing aspect to the plane which it is p assing thr ough, a nd to the phases of the Ring- Pass- Not. Therefore, if you wish to understand the conditions of a given travelling atom it is not enough to know the facets of its path, you m ust also know the phases of the influences to which its nature is re acting. This is called Si dereal Astrology, but the phases of this Astrology are so vast t hat they concern only the lives of the solar systems, jus t as the planetary Astrology concerns the phases of the Planets. The nearest point of contact which you h ave to Sidereal Astrology is known to you a s the Zodiac. It is obvious then, if you co nsider t he life of a man, you must consider it i n relatio n to the solar system of which h e forms a part; and you mu st also consider that solar system in relation to the Cosmos. Sidereal Astrology will give you t he phases of evoluti on. You see then, that there atoms of specific types that have set tled down per manently upon each plane, and move at constant distances from the Central Stilln ess, in the same way that a liquid, c ontaining di fferent substances in solution will, if placed in a glass t ube and whirled rapidly round at the end of a string, sh ow clearly the sorting out of the component parts of the mixture acc ording to their specific gravity, the heaviest or most composite towards th e periphery, so that at the conclusio n of the process you can perceive the grad uated bands of different types o f substance. These atoms have proc eeded as far as their nature permits t hem to proceed in evolutio n. You will perceive that each new phase of evolution achieves th at utmost complexit y that its factors per mit, and then settles down to a rhythmic repetition of the sequence it has arrived at . The fresh phase of evoluti on, which b egins when t he next phase of the Ring- Chaos overtop ples the stability achieved, starts where t he last phase finished, because it already has in its nature all t hat the last phase has achieved. You see now th e signific ance of the maxim `As a bove, s o below’. The Cosmos is the framework upon which all is b uilt up. You start where God leaves off; therefore what was in God is in you, and something of your own which is c alled free-will, though it is a bad name. Now with regard t o the evolutio n of the travellin g atoms, these give rise t o solar systems. You will remember in the previous lectures that these"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"solar systems arose on different planes of the universe according to their Cosmic s pecific gravity. That is to say, they start their evoluti on at different phases of Cosmic development. But you will remember that the outgoing a toms gather up matter from each plane they pass through to build into their universe. Those systems which are developed upon other planes than yours I wi ll not deal with in t he present course of study, for they are too remote for practical p urposes. I will consider, however, the phases of development though wh ich the systems pass that originat e upon the seven th Cosmic plane, of which your solar system is an example. Let us therefore, trace the life of a particular travellin g atom which is to become your sun and attendant syste m of planets. You will remember that it has been round the circle o f the Cosmic Rays and experience d their twelve in fluences, both positive and negative; and that it has, in its co mposition, matter of the seven Cosmic planes. Its Numbers, therefore, are; 3 Because it is u nder the influence of the Rings, 7 Because it has matter of seven types, 12 Because it has been acted upon by the twelve Rays and each of the seven planes of matter will have its particular Number, from 3 to 9 inclusive. This, having passed out through the placid planes of Cosmic ma tter, and taking with it as much as it can draw from each plane, arrives finally at its own plane where a n equilibriu m is est ablished between the centrifugal and centripetal forces of the Cosmos and its own bulk. It then settles down up on its orbit. The Cosmic influences to which it is exposed can be calculated in an orderly sequenc e, because they are definitely established . It will pass round the twelve Rays, and experienc e the change of the phases of the Rings, an d in addition to this, the influences of the Great Organisms of the other planes will, whenever their orbits happen to bring them near to each other, for they move at different paces upon different planes, influence the matter drawn from that plane in the make up of that system. This Great organism that we are considering has settled down to its orbit , and you c an conceive of it as a nucleus o f that original travelling atom surrounded by g reat cloudy, unformed, unorganis ed belts of matter of the different planes. These are held about by attraction of its mass. The limit and extent of its attraction marks the extent of the system . Like all else in the Cosmos, this mass has a rotating m ovement which is derived from the original ce ntral atom. The movement of that atom within its orbit gradually, in the course of untold ages, flattens out into a spinning disc. Then the motions, which you s aw in the formation of the Cosmos, are gone through, b ecause the laws of motion are the same on every plane, and the solar system sorts o ut its matter into seven planes owing to specific gravity. Section 2. Chapter VII. The Evoluti on of a Great Entity. Conceive now the experie nce of existence as it is apprehended by th e dawning consciousness of a Great Entity. Hitherto we have looked at the evol ution of points of manifestation from without; we will now co nsider t he matter from within, a s it appears subjectively to that Cosmic unit of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"manifestation referred to as a Great Entity. First, conceive the sensation of a whirling, an d no other sensation at all. Co nceive yourself becoming so habituated to that whirling that its cessation would o ccasion a sensation but not its continuance. Conceive a secondary motion developi ng, perceived a t first because of its newness , and losing its stimulative power owing to habituation, as did the primary , and so on, in sequenc e. You will now perceive that movements that are habitual must be maintained if an absence of distrac ting sensation, which is th e basis of attention, is to be arrived at. Therefore the accustomed movements are implicit in t he `Being’ of that which is based upon them, and when awake ning into manifestation it will always seek to establish these motions as the basis of its existence. Now cast your m ind back over the teaching given you by your previous t eacher, and recall the phases of movement to which th e Great Entities be came habituated in the course of Cosmic evolutio n which led to their development, and you wi ll see that all these move ments have become implicit in t heir nature and will be reproduced when they, in turn, set out upon that inner elaboration which co nstitutes the next phase of Cosmic evolutio n, the phase of the evolutio n of the Great Entities, bearing in mind that upon whatever pla ne or Ring of the Cosmos the Entities settle down for a cycle of evoluti on, the numerical values of the evolutio n will be determined thereby. We will now co nsider t he evol ution of that Great Entity with wh ich we are especially concerned. Implicit in its nature are all phases of the Cosmos, hence the signi ficance of the Hermetic maxim `As above, so below’. Whatever is develo ped under a certain set of conditions reproduces those in the recapitulation through which it goes, prior to the undertaking of original d evelopment. The Great Entity then, having this basis of Cosmically evolved f actors to work upon, combines and recombines them into the infinite divers ity of a manifested universe. Therefore the infinite diversity of a manifested universe c an be dissolved into the prime simplicity of the Cosmic b eginnings. E ach phase or aspect of the universe ha s its origin in a similar p hase or aspect of the Cosmos. A Great Entity, having settled down u pon its Cosmic orbit, proceeds upon the work of evolutio n. Havin g had the Cosmic factors implanted in its nature by t he experiences , it proceeds to bring t hem into function independently of the Cosmic impulse of its own mo mentum, which mo mentum may be called a Cosmic Will. You will perceive that we are still speaking in terms of dynamics. It is not until a high degree o f evoluti on has been achieved t hat we can speak in terms of psycholog y, but there is an unbroken line of development from movement to thought. Tangential movement is a simple form of reaction. Thought is a n infinitely complex form of reaction. It is a questio n of difference of degree, n ot difference of kind. Fundamentally there is no difference of kind in anythi ng, because all ca n be reduced to the prime central stillness, but upon the planes of manifestation there are differences of kind, because the Rays issuing from the Central Stillness diverge as they proceed; and"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"as conscious ness is limit ed in its objective f unctioning to one plane at a time, a unity of the innermost cannot be conceived save by the consciousness that stands therein, and, as the transition from one plane to another of any Ray or line of force is marked by a subdivision of that Ray, you will perceive that there are differences of kind in manifestation, although there is a fundamental unity. Differences of degree are reckoned along the length of the same Ray. Differences of kind are reckoned in the sequence of Rays round the circle. This digression which, strictly speaking, be longs to another section of the subject, is made here to ensure clearness o f comprehension in the argume nt pursued. A Great Entity commences its evoluti on by develo ping, not the Cosmic Rings, but the concept of those Rings. That is to say, it puts in motion the memories of the experiences it underwent when t hat which afterwards c ondensed into its substance, was part of the primordial s wirlings. It knows goo d and evil, and therefore is a God. It is the knowledge of good and evil which enables it to manifest, because the good is a dynamism, and the evil is a thrust-block. The Ring- Pass-Not o f a universe is t he limitation of the attention of the Great Entity forming that universe. I t is its d etermination to concentrate its attention upon the task it has set itself. You get the equivalent i n the psychological mechanism of the censor, and in the processes of the concentration of attention. Chapter VIII. The Relation of a Great Entity to the Cosmos. A travelling atom, having passed through all the phases of Cosmic evolutio n up to that of which its production is the crown an d completion, makes a final journey to the Central Stillness. Then, by the overbala ncing of the equip oise, it issues forth, but with this difference, it has itself become, owing to its develop ment, a centre of attraction . Thereby it draws to itself a certain n umber of atoms of each plane through which it p asses until it arrives at the Cosmic belt which is decreed as its habitation by its own sp ecific gravity in relation to the centrifugal forces of the Cosmic wh irlings. There will be then, in this new organisa tion thus formed, a central n ucleus of the travelling atom. This central nu cleus will have implicit in it, the modes of reaction to which it became habituated during its experienc e of the phases of Cosmic evolution. In order to achieve the absence of sensation to which the presence and the continuance of habituated reactions in their acc ustomed ordered seque nce alone can give rise, this nuclear atom continues to make its accustomed reactions owing to the momentum of its particles . These actions upon its part induce the corresponding reac tions of the loose aggregations of matter from each Cosmic p lane that are gathered about it. Thus is built up a miniature Cosmos. As may b e perceived by a little thought, this C osmos, with the nuclear atom correspo nding to the Central Stillness, which, in the larger Cosmos transmuted all reactions, in this, the reflected Cosmos, performs the same function. At the same time the entire organis m is su bject to the phases of the Cosmic Forces. I ts synthetic aspect receiving an impulse during the phases of the Cosmic Day , so called, or those segments of the circle in which t he positive or sti mulative forces are predominant; and its analytical forces receiving a stimulus when passing through those segments of the circle in which the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"negative forces predominate. Likewise, as it passes, through the sphere of influence of each Ray, will the correspo nding forces of its own n ature rec eive an additional stimulus. You may co nceive, th en, this great organis m travellin g round a circle which is divided into four quarters - p ositive and negative alternately - and in addition to this each quart er is subdivided into the spheres of influence of three Rays. You have now th e key to the so-called Days and Nights o f Brahma, and to the periods of evolutio n; but, as this great o rganism we are now considering is itself a miniature Cosmos, you wi ll perceive that a more speedy cycle will be performed within its own nature. In addition to these influences there is a nother set of influences to be considered. These influences being the gravitational attractions of other great orga nisms u pon other planes of the Cosmos. The relations between one great organis m and others upon its own p lane are fixed and determined before evol ution commences, and, being co nstant, need not be considere d. But the revolutio ns of Great Entities upon other planes of the Cosmos are conducted at different paces and without relation to those Entities of other planes than their own. Therefore they will pass in line with ea ch other perio dically, momentarily blocking the pull of the central attraction upon those orga nisms f urther out than themselves, a nd also exerti ng a gravitatio nal attraction upon all particles o f their own pl ane and planes above their own, in the mass of a great orga nism on an outer path. This cutting off temporarily of the central a ttraction upsets the equilibrium of the outer organism, removing the centripetal check upon the centrifugal force, but the tendency of certain types of molecules to fly inwards towards th e attracting body tends to counterbalance this. Also the whole will of the nuclear atom of that organism is to maintain constant the habitual conditions which have b ecome the law of its nature. The habituated conditions it may be said, in parenthesis, are those sequenc es which ma n discovers and christens `Nat ural Laws’. Likewise the forces of the Cosmos tend to maintain equilibriu m compensating each other, but there occ urs, nevertheless , at irregular in tervals, conditions which require compensation, and these give rise to varying degrees o f irregularit y in the movement of Great Entities, and hence to the presence of positive evil, sin a nd disease within their spheres. The Cosmos itself has to strive to attain adjustment at the commencement of each phase of its evolutio n, and the irregularities wh ich occur b efore adjustment is effected, and which have to be pulled straight i n the course o f evolution, are the origin of this evil, in the sense in which the word is used popularly. Cosmic evil is a limitation, an opposition, and is the prime condition of manifestation. This Cosmic evil, th e Divine evil, the Divine death, is implicit in each Great Entity, and is the basis o f its manifestation and evolu tion. For without limitation, finiteness, there can be no manifestation, and witho ut death or discarding of the outworn, there can be no progress. These elements then of Cosmic opposition are always present in a manifested universe; but universal evil, un der its two aspects of sin or p erverted f orce, and disease or perverted form, are due to the irregularities of orbit caused by pa ssings"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"of great organisms u pon different planes of the Cosmos. These are always found in their extre me form at the beginni ngs of an evolution, and are generally adjusted in the course of an evolution as compensations are made, until, at the end of an evolution, a perfect and rhythmical ba lance of the whole C osmos has been achieved - a synthesis o f action and reaction which maintains stability. You may conceive of the Cosmos as extended in space and in time. But when you co me to consider a Gr eat Entity, its parts or aspects are not extended in space or time, but are implicit in its nature as habitual reactions which are made whenever and wherever the appropriate stimulus is forthcoming. Therefore, all the phases of Cosmic evolu tion - The Rings, t he Rays and the Planes - occupy neither time nor space in the organis m of a Great Entity, but are implicit in its nature. This is the fourth dimension - the dimension of the implicit nature of the nuclear atom, which d etermines the nature of the manifested universe which it pr ojects. We have seen then, that the travelling atom builds itself a form of Cosmic s ubstance out of the matter of the seven Cosmic planes; and this form, of which t he nuclear atom with its habituated reactions is t he ensouling li fe, is subject to the influences enumerated. We have now , you will perceive, trac ed two p hases of evolution, the Cosmos phases, and the more rapid recapitulation of the phases of the development of a Great Entity; an d we have studied that Great Entity in its relati on to the Cosmos which is its environment, and to the Central S tillness which is t he compensation of all forces of the Cosmos, which is its God. We will now consider the life of a Great Entity in rela tion to the universe of which it is itself the God - the Creator - the Conditioner - and the Sustainer. You will perceive that a Great Entity comes out from the Central Stillness and takes its pl ace upon its appointed circuit, and conducts its o rganisation under the influence of the negative or d estructive phase of the Cosmos, and this may seem strange to you, that creation should take place under the influence of a destructive ph ase of the Cosmos, or any o ther organisation which, by overbalancing the synthesis o f forces achieved i n a phase of evolution, causes them to embark upon a fresh phase of development in order to re-est ablish t heir harmony; and as they commence this phase with the experienc e of the preceding phase implicit in their nature, they commence where t he last phase ended. They climb u pon its shoulders; and thereby evoluti on arises to a great er complexit y, for it has now become an organisa tion of organisms. You will see this principle prevailing throughout all things, great and little, above and below, it is one of the Cosmic pri nciples, a nd one little known, i f known at all. Likewise the phases of development during which a Great Entity organises its elf are internal and therefore subjective. They are not carried out under the stimulus of sensations derived from external conditions, but under the stimulus of feelings arising from internal co nditions, and the phase corresponding to the phase of existenc e which a h uman soul passes through between death and birth. This phase, having been completed, a Great Entity, having arrived at the greatest degre e of organisa tion which it is capable of with th e conditions at its disposal, can go no further. Being organise d througho ut, each part is affected by, and responds to, changes in any other part. It is therefore"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"fully conscious, for consciousness is but awaren ess, and awaren ess is b ut reaction to a stimulus. The conditions of its nature, being ha bitual in their sequenc e, no longer give rise to conscious stim uli. The Great Entity has therefore a consciousness , but nothing of which it can be conscious exce pt itself. The Cosmos, be it noted, being entirely habitual to this Entity, forms the conditioning ba ckground of its consciousness , which is comparable t o the human sub- consciousness of the automatic level. It has then created, by the sensations of its own nature, a concept of itself, of which it is aware. Here then, is a novel s ensation, and it dwells upon it. This is the self- consciousness of a Great Entity. This is a creation. `And God made man in His own im age and likeness’. A universe is a concept in the mind of a Great Entity. It is created by the self-contemplation of a Great Entity. The consciousness of a Great Entity then, being aware of this image of itself as a whole, next becomes aware o f the changes in the proportions o f the forces of its own na ture caused by the influences through which it p asses, thus giving rise to fresh concepts concerning itself, and these concepts are added to the existin g complex, conditioning it h istorically . These are the different outflowings of creative force concerning which you h ave heard. This teaching co ncerning t he subjective and the objective as pects of a Great Entity is the key to the doctrine of pantheism, which is a half-truth, as generally understood. For a Great Orga nism holds in its memory the Cosmic conditions although It itself does not contain the Cosmos of which it is a part. Likewise the mental picture of itself projected by a Great Entity reflects that Great Entity in its e ntirety, being the product of perfected conscious ness, but it is not that Entity of which it is t he emanation, though it is e ntirely conditioned by the nature and experiences of that Entity, having no other origin and being expose d to no other influences whatsoever, for it has no other existence save in t he consciousness of the Entity conceivin g it, therefore it is n ot affected by Cosmic c onditions, being of another order of creation to the Great Entities which are the fellows of its Creator, and all of which, i n course of time, project their concepts of themselves. I t is, however, affected by the Cosmic phases because the Great Entity, which is the basis of its existence is a ffected by them. It is this fact that secures a universe from disturbance and permits of no intervening influence intruding in t he relations between it and its Creator and Sustainer - its God. Its God, therefore, is omnipotent as far as it is concerned, though Hi mself conditioned by the conditions of the Cosmos. Its God is infinite as far as it is concerned, because He is `all that is’ to it. What He is n ot, is not, as far as it is concerned. But He Himself is finite in relatio n to the Cosmos, which is infinite as far as He is c oncerned, being all that is for Him, though itself finite in relation to the Unmanifest. Omnipotence means free from the influences of any conditioning power . Infinite means the sum total of the influences towards which an organis m is ca pable of reacting.

The Projection of the Concept of the Universe. “And the Earth was without form and void, a nd darkness was up on the face of the deep” (Gen. I. 2). As we have alre ady seen, a Great entity projects its concept of itself. This, however, is not the beginni ng of objectivisation in a universe, t hough dealt with fi rst in the order of instruc tion in order to make that which follows more comprehensible ; for the Great Entity, when it projects the image o f itself found substance of the same nature as the projection, awaiting th e organis ation which that projection should bring ab out. It will be recalled that the Great Entity gathered about itself atoms of each Cos mic plane, out of which it f ormed its body. These atoms themselves are Entities, though of a lesser degree o f development than the Great Entity of which t hey form a part. Being of lesser development the full recapitulatory growth is achieved earlier. Each atom, having realised its elf, has created a concept of itself. These concepts, projected by the atoms, are not atoms, but so many units of knowledge o f ways in which reaction is possible. They are not, therefore, sorted out into concentric belts, because there is n othing in them upon which gra vitation can act. They are merely forms of reaction. Now the conscious ness of a Great Entity is not aware o f the individual reac tions of its atoms, any mo re than the consciousness of the cells c omposing its b ody. Therefore, when it seeks to conceive an image o f itself it has to take the reactions of the different types o f atoms in their respective aggregates, and is dependent upon the atomic concepts for the creation of the necessary atomic images. Therefore, the Great Entity has to create its concept of itself in objective substance, and is therefore limited and bound by conditions o f the nature of the already created images which it utilises. Thus the atoms, by conceiving their own im ages, p erform the primal act of creation. The first act of creation proceeds from the body of God, and is but a mass of unorganised u nits. “Darkness was up on the face of the deep”. These units having no organis ation, and consequ ently no relations among themselves, c ould not attain to objective co nscious ness, but as soon as the concept of the Great Entity, based upon its Cos mic experie nces, became projected, it organised them into relationships, and they then became conscious of each other - became affected by each other. It will thus be seen that the cosmic a toms created the atoms of each prime sub-plane of manifestation, and that the atoms thus created by be ing brought into relationship each with its own ki nd by ac tion of the Great Entity, develo ped into sub- planes. The prime atom of each plane then, has a direct relationship with its corres ponding plane of Cosmic substance, and conseque ntly is influenced by the Great Entities upon that plane. Hence there is always a certain o pposition to the Great"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Entity of a universe o n the part of the atoms which f orm its matter. This is ver y important point. We have seen then - first the projection of the atomic concepts; then later, the projection of the Great Entity’s concept of itself which organises t hose atoms into a miniature Cosmos which is c alled a universe in these papers to distinguish it from that stage of existenc e which gave rise t o its parent and Creator. Chapter X. The Relation between the Projected Image and the Logoidal Conscious ness. “And the Spirit o f God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said; Let there be light, and there was light”. You have heard in previous lectures how th e atoms, or units of manifestation of a universe, ar e formed; and also how the currents and tides of Divine Power are set flowing through them, so that an exact re plica of the Cosmos is formed in miniature, the corresp ondences being exact, s ave that the cycles of a universe, m oving in a smaller ra dius, have a more rapid rhythm. (Note, that a rhythm is bu t a series o f repetitions). Two phases of logoidal evolutio n have b een outlined:- (a) The phase of the development of the matters of an universe. (b) The phase of the development of the Tides and Rays. The one is the raw material ou t of which an universe is made. The other is the skeleton - the framework up on which it is built. We have then, enormous quantiti es of atoms differentiated only into planes, and sub-planes of planes. Seven dis tinct types and seven sub-types o f each type. We will now co nsider t he third phase of logoidal evolution. At the beginning o f an evoluti on the Logos is a lone in that sphere which is a fterwards to become its universe. I t is conscious only of itself, for there is no object in existence within th at sphere of which it ca n be conscious. It will thus be seen that the Logos reverses t he order of the psychologist’s concept of the evolution of consciousness, having first Cos mic conscious ness, then self-consciousness, and then objective conscious ness. The Logos then, is now aware t hat a thought-form has been projected from its consciousness into its aura. For, under one aspect, the universe m ay be conceived of as the aura of God. This consciousness of an object produces a reaction in the Logoidal conscious ness. There is a subject-o bject adaptation, and this adaptation produces a corresponding modification in the reflected universe wh ich becomes capable of an object-subject reaction. Thus a relationship, or reciprocity, is establishe d between the Logos, or Great Entity, and that projected image o f the Logoidal consciousness which is the incipien t universe It must not be thought, however, that the Logoidal consciousness is limited to awareness of its objectified universe. The Logoidal focused consciousness , or conscious consciousness , is thus limit ed. For a focused, or conscious consciousness , can only be built up out of awaren ess of, and reactions to, objects. But the logoid al sub-consciousness is aware o f the Cosmos and the conscious ness is in fluenced by the sub-conscious ness which is its b asis and backgrou nd; and as the Cosmic Tides ebb, flow, and move round the Circle, the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"corresponding as pects of the Logoidal sub-consci ousness are stimulated by their influences, a nd the sensations thus engendered in the Logoidal conscious ness ar e forthwith incorporated in the self-projecti on, which is t he universe, a nd the conscious consciousness of the Logos perc eives them there, so that an infinite series o f reactions, and modifications of reactions, proceeds. At first in broad and simple m ovements, but gradually multiplying into an inconceivable c omplexity. All these modifications influence the atomic ma tters of the incipien t universe, and determine their nature and characterise th em. It is these characterisatio ns that are subsequ ently discovered by ma n as Natural Laws, or observed sequenc es. Thus are the natures of things determined. They are built into them by the Logoidal re actions to the conditions of its Cosmic e nvironment, and these modifications are constantly proceeding. They do not endure for a phase and cease, but continue as long as the atomic sub-planes to which th ey correspond, are in existenc e. Thus an elemental evolutio n proceeds apart from the evolution of Life and Form as we kn ow it. Chapter XI. Auto-reactions and Cosmic Me mory. You have perceived in the course of these lectures that each phase of evolution , wheth er Cosmic o r Logoidal, starts with a new type o f action or reac tion; and every possible variation is worked o ut by adding the possibility of reaction to the reactions alrea dy established . It resembles the possible number of changes t hat can be rung upon a chime of bells, and the addition of a bell to a chime makes possible a great increas e in the number of variations which can be performed. Thus each new factor evol ved increases the complexit y of manifestation, and when the utmost diversit y, of which t he factor renders the universe capable, has been arrived at , that phase of evolution has reached its maxim um development, and there is a pause in the process while the Logoidal c onsciousness perc eives what has taken place, and sees that it is goo d and by absorbing it into Its consciousness affects a new reaction, which re action is, in its turn, projected into the manifested universe; s o that evolutio n resembles a series o f duplicating mirrors wherein the consciousness of the Logos projects its own i mage; b ecomes aware o f, and reacts to, the image thus projected; and the reaction affects the projection, and so the circle is everlastingly revolving. You will perceive that the Logos, or subject, has become aware o f an object; that object being a r eflected projection, or replica, o f the subject. Awareness of an external object on the part of the subject must be reproduced as a corresponding re flection of consciousness in the object, so that the object is eq ually capable of awaren ess of an extern al object. But the object, being of a different order of manifestation to the subject, cannot be aware of the subject but can only be aware of itself, and of the influences which proc eed to it from the subject. Hence the saying that “No man hath at any time seen God”. God cannot be seen by any unit of the manifested universe during a manifestation. He c an only be deduced. The objective awaren ess is no t confined to any one point of the manifested universe, b ut is a diffused aware ness, a round"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"what m ay be conceived o f as the Central Ring - metaphorically speaking - or to use more precis e but more abstract terms; those types of atoms that most nearly resemble the atoms of the Cosmic Centre, that are of the simplest type and least bound by complexities, form the basis of the awaren ess. But let it be clearly understood that the aware ness is n ot atomic re action, but it is entirely of the `force’ or `life’ side of things. It is a modification of the Logoidal conscious ness, not the projected atomic conscious ness. It is the first reaction in a universe which is rel ated to that universe alo ne, and does not originat e in and return to, the Logos. A subject has appeared in the object. Conscious ness m ay be defined as reaction plus memory. That is to say, an action takes place in a particular type o f substance and that reaction produces a secondary reaction in another type of existenc e, which is relat ed to the first in the same way as the atoms of universes are related to the atoms of a Cosmos, or the form of a universe is related to the consciousness of the Logos. That is to say, the subject conceives ideas concerning itself, and these react among themselves, and the reaction - to use a metaphor - leaves a track in space round which the movement of its reac tion continues to flow as pure movement apart from actual transition in space of the objects which perform the movement. That flowing of pure movement in space is Me mory - the reproduction of an image of an action in another plane of manifestation; and consciousness is b uilt out of memory, as distinguishe d from awaren ess, which is a form of reaction between two planes. It will thus be seen that the form, or framework upon which th e universe is built, has been made the basis of a third type of manifestation - the manifestation of auto-reac tions. Chapter XII. The Birth of Consci ousness in t he Universe. It is very necessary that a clear concept should be formed of the meaning of `conscious ness’ and this point will therefore be elaborated. You will recall that, in the teaching concerning the nature of a Great Entity, it was explaine d that consciousness was du e to the complete reciproc al reactions of all aspects of the factors and capacities f or reaction that had been develope d in the course of a Cosmic evol ution. Conscious ness is a n integratio n of reactions, so that any change in any part is res ponded to by the corresp onding adjustments of the whole. It is a principle o f compensation that is invol ved, and this all-inclusive compensatory adjustment may be termed the basis of Cosmic P ersonality. In its earliest p hases it c onstitutes the synth esis of the latent reaction-capacity of an Entity. It is essentially a set of relationships, not of mechanics, an d is therefore abstract, but with t he development of external objects that affect the Entity new influences are brought to bear upon the compensatory adjustments, and the new compensatory reactions are thus called into play. We then distinguish two levels of consciousness:- (a) The basic co nscious ness of the inherent constitution. (b) The compensations evoke d by environmental influences. A Great Entity, then, starts by evol ving a basic nature, projects its own image; and its aware ness of that image, in its"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"multifarious aspects, builds up the second aspect of its consciousness . These two p hases corres pond to those aspects o f a soul known as the Individuality and the Personality. An Individuality, wheth er of a Great Entity or of the microcos mos which is m an, is that series o f organise d reactions which reac hed an equilibrium in the preceding phases of evolution. Those phases, having pa ssed away, nothing of them remains but the capacities f or reaction that have b een acquired by that Entity. An Individuality then, is a set of stereotyped reaction- capacities. A Personality is that set of reaction-capacities which the addition of a new factor in evolutio n has made possible . Individuality and Personality, then, refer to the stages of development and have a historical signi ficance. They refer to Time, not to Form. That which is t he Personality today will be part of the Individuality tomorrow. A Great Entity, then, builds up its first Personality out of its reactions to the Cosmic P hases. It becomes conscious of the Self thus develo ped when recipr ocal ac tion of all its aspects is es tablished. That consciousness, which it t hus develops , is itsel f an existence, objective to the mind conceiving it. As soon as consciousness has focused it as a thought-f orm, it is cr eated and exists on its own acc ount, and has become an object of consciousness ; and in this thought-f orm thus created, the same interplay of forces is s et up which, i n the Cosmos, gave rise to the Great Entities, a nd the process c ontinues. As the Cosmos is reproduced in miniature in the great Company of Entities, by means of which its evolutio n is now proceeding, so the thought-form projected by a great Entity in its turn gave rise t o Entities. But these Entities begin their evolution at the point which th e Great Entity which projects them has reached at the time of their projection. For, just as the Great Entity has, latent in itself, all the phases of the Cosmos, so have they latent in themselves, all the capacities of the Great Entity. We see then in this projected thought-form of a Great Entity which we call a universe:- 1. The atoms, projected by the Cosmic atoms, drawn into the orbit of that travelling atom which became a Great Entity. 2. The lines of force and flowing currents, which ar e the projected consciousness of that Great Entity. 3. Out of the co-ordin ations established by th ese second-type forces of the atoms, we get the setting up of currents of pure movements in space, which are the analogues of the first movement in space which gave rise to the Ring- Cosmos. Thus evolution runs its cycle an d returns upon a higher arc to the door by which it issu ed forth. It is these currents of pure move ment (to be clearly distinguishe d from the transition in space of any obj ect) which form the basis of consciousness in t he projected universe. As before stated, action and reaction do not constitute consciousness . It is reaction plus memory which is th e basis of consciousness . And the currents in space in pure move ment are the basis o f memory because, being frictionless b ecause substanceless, t hey persist. We have then, action and reaction of manifest actions, and the persistenc e of the reflection of that reaction in a state which, relative to the plane upon which the reaction took"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"place, is unmanifest. Hence the saying that ”Out of Chaos issues Crea tion”. The Unmanifest has been organise d. Something exists which di d not exist be fore. Crea tion has taken place. These reactions speedily affect each other and so become organised among themselves, and this reciprocal r eaction is the basis of personality. Thus the first develo pment of conscious ness in a universe is one great and comprehensive Overso ul. The tracks of reaction which were developed in the Oversoul by a ction on the plane of the atoms, form invisible ruts which, when a ny atom cross es their track, cause it to follow that course until such time as the attraction, or pressure o f other influences overcom e that influence. Try and conceive of the first movement of an atom scoring a rut in `force’; o ther atoms getting ca ught in this rut, and following its c urve for a time, then breaking away to follow the impulses of their own nature and other atoms taking their place. And again c onceive the process as viewed from the plane of the atoms, you would perc eive the myriads of atoms engaged in their tangential dance, and from time to time you would perceive an atom suddenly change the mode of its action, pursue the new mode for a time, as if captive un der the influence of some invisible compulsion, and then break away and return to its original m ode of motion. If then, you exa mine the rut again, you would f ind it has been worn deeper and the next atom would be held longer be fore it broke away, and in addition to the path determined by th e rut, each atom dances with a movement of its own, the movement of the atom would produce modifications in the rut, and with each atom that it caught and forced to follow its path for a time, the rut would be modified. This is the first and simplest phase of the soul and the body. The tracks formed in space by gyrating atoms, catch other atoms and produce secondary movements, and the track gro ws in consequenc e. The atoms which f orm these tracks ar e analogous to the Travelling atoms of the Cosmos. Chapter XIII. The Beginnings o f Mind and Group Conscious ness. We are now dealing w ith the begin nings of mind, and it is necessary that these fundamentals be clearly grasped. You have alr eady been told that movement of any object leaves a track in s pace. The object comes to rest, but the movement, as apart from the object, continues as pure movement. It is pure movement - movement in the abstract - which gave rise to the Cosmos. This move ment gave rise even tually to the locked-up nodes of opposing forces, which are the prime atoms. It is the movement of these atoms which f orms the basis of manifestation. Manifestation, as you know it, is associat ed with the movement of objects, but Life - Mind - God - are abstract, and they are based upon pure movement unconnected with any object. In our studies we have reached the point where t he reflections of the Cosmic atoms, gathered about a Great Entity, have ma de the prime matter of a universe. And this prim e matter has been ordered and organised into a miniature Cos mos by the reflection of the microc osmic r eproduction of the Cosmic Macroc osm in a Great Entity. You will recall that, in the evolutio n of the Cosmos, the similar types of atoms settled down u pon their planes, but a more complex type of atom could not settle down, b ecause their"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"greater bulk caused them to re-ac t with a corresponding force to the centrifugal forces of the Cosmos, and instead of being held upon the 7th plane by the synt hesis o f forces, continued their outward pa th till they struck ag ainst the Ring-Pass-Not and were sent back to the Central Stillness . Likewise in a universe, the atoms appropriate to each plane drew their tracks in s pace, and because there is n o persistence of action, they are mutually cancelling. These tracks form the elemental essence of each plane. But these atoms which are too complex in structure to settle down u pon a plane, having gon e out to the uttermost plane, return thence, not to a Central Stillness, but to a central p oint of unmanifestation, where th e Unmanifest wells up and becomes Manifest. That is to say, that at that phase of developing manifestation wherein n ew aspects of the Logoidal c onsciousness are being realised , these travelling atoms find their nearest affinity. You will recall that it was previousl y said that the movement of an object leaves a track of pure move ment in the Unmanifest, and remember that the Cosmic state is unmanifest when viewed fr om the standpoint of an universe. The Logoidal images t herefore, have to pass from a Cosmic to a manifest condition, and in that transition they pass through a phase which is id entical with th at state of existenc e of the tracks in space drawn by the movement of an object. Therefore, being of the same nature, they can influence the tracks in space thus drawn. These tracks in space are always of the nature of a closed figure - like the tangential atom tracks - a nd as the different Logoidal c oncepts are externalised , these atom tracks are influenced by them, and so reproduce in miniature the Logoidal P hases. So that you ca n conceive great numbers of travelling atoms returning to the creative centre, and being, as it were, bathed in the influences of the Logoidal id eas. These Logoidal ideas, of course, are building t he framework o f the universe, and so creating a huge replica of the Great Entity which is its elf a replica o f the Cosmos. But within th at universe, b eing tracks i n space of the travelling atoms not the atoms themselves, are also replicas o f the Logos, for the reasons given. So that you have, upon the 7th plane of an universe, gathered about the creative centre, great numbers of two-natured entities:- (a) A travelling atom which, because it h as passed out through all the planes, has experienc ed the reactions of all the planes and therefore can react in each of these respective ways when subjected to the stimuli which produce that reaction. (b) You have als o, in addition to this atomic body, the track in space it describes in its atomic dance. This track it h as in common with all other atoms, but in the case of a travellin g atom which ha s returned to the central cre ative point, this track in s pace is impressed with the Logoidal image, and this distinguishes it from, what m ay now be called, the inanimate atoms. These atoms have come under the influence of the Logoidal s elf-consci ousness, and their tracks in space have been caused to re-act to that image by the sympa thetic ind uction of vibration , so that they have become miniature reflections of the Logos. W hereas they themselves have m erely generated a"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"tangential track of movement which had a simple rhythm of the repetition of that circular movement. They have imparted to them, by the Logoidal vibrations, the same rhyth m as the Logos is vibrating to. Now remember that a repetition of circular m ovements gives rise t o a rhythm, and that such a vibratio n is sim ply the impacting of a rhythm of one plane upon the substance of another. The Logoidal rhyth ms therefore, set the travelling atoms of an universe that experience their influence, vibrating to the same rhythm . Thus it is t hat the travelling atoms of an universe contain the potentialities o f reaction of which t he nature of the Logos is c apable. That is to say, that the Logos, or Great Entity, in the course of its Cos mic evolutio n, has acquired certain types of reaction. These are built into composite rhythms, and the composite rhyth ms are built into great chords. These chords are series o f rhythms within rhyth ms - loops upon loops, to use another metaphor. It is these composite rhythms that are impress ed upon the travelling atoms of the universe when t hey approach that phase of existe nce where the Unmanifest is co ming int o Manifestation and, by the development of their own nature, are able to contact that which is relatively unmanifest to their phase of existence. The concrete movement of an atom sets up an abstract movement-pure motion. Pure motion is the characteristic o f the Cosmos, and therefore is o f the same type of existence as a Great Entity, or Logos. So that, each moving atom in the universe, by its movement, creates a counterpart of itself, of the same type of existence as that which forms the Cosmos. Therefore of the same nature as the Logos of its universe, and therefore capable of reciprocal reac tion with that Logos. But the atoms of the planes, having settled down u pon their planes, do not come into direct contact with the Logoidal Mind in its re alisatio n of concepts. But the travelling atoms, because they have not settled down u pon the planes, have not become bound to their own forms - ar e not stabilise d - and therefore return to a primitive condition after they have r eached a highly evolved st ate, and the forces of that primitive co ndition cannot influence them, as they can the atoms of their own plane. These travelling atoms, then, have escaped from the laws of the manifested universe, which bi nd into forms (for the universe itself is a thought-form) and are therefore exp osed to the same laws which condition the Logoidal nature, and therefore receive an identical impress to that which t he Cosmos has imprinte d on the Logos. ”And God made man in His im age and likeness”. Having received this imprint, these atoms proceed to gather about themselves ot her atoms, because the track in space, having had a definite rhythmic al circular motion impress ed upon it, and no longer performing a cannoning tangential Br ownian movement, sets up a vortex, and the vortex draws other atoms into the sphere of its movement and holds them gyrating a bout it. Then you have this condition, an atom, the reflection of a Cosmic atom, which is too complex to settle down upon a plane of manifestation, returns to the centre, having developed, by its movement, a circuit o f pure motion which is o f a Cosmic type of manifestation. Its Cosmic a spect is st amped with a Logoidal"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"image, t uned to the Logoidal rhythm by the process described, and this abstract aspect of the atom, being thus conditioned with qualities, c auses its c oncrete aspect to move with a circular rhythm of a correspo nding type. And this circular rhythm, being thus held constant, as distinguish ed from the tangential move ments of the atoms of the planes, sets up a vortex, and the atoms about it are drawn into that vortex. Thus we have a Cosmic vibration of pure motion holding a travelling atom to a particular type o f movement, and the travelling atom by its m ovement, drawin g other atoms of the plane upon which this occurs, in to its orbit, and holding th em there. These three aspects are:- (a) The Sparks o f Cosmos, or Divine ensouling Spirit, which was first describe d as a track in s pace described by the atom. (b) The atom, which is th e beginnings o f a vehicle and is known to you a s the seed-atom. (c) The atoms of the 7th plane drawn int o the orbit of the seed-atom and constituting its 7 th plane body. Chapter XIV. The Seed-atom Building a Sevent h Plane Body. We have trac ed the development of a three-par t unit of evolution, and you wi ll see that three is again the number of manifestation - three Rings to the Cosmos - three aspects o f an universe - and also three factors to a unit of consciousness . These units of consciousness are each separate in so far as the seed-atoms, and those atoms of the 7th plane matter which surround them, are concerned. The seed-atom and its surrou nding e nvelope forms a definite system of stresses and reactions which are intercompensating. In their reactions to each others’ stresses they have achieved a n equilibrium, and therefore become an unit. A unit is that set of interacting f orces which have achieved a n equilibrium and thus become stabilise d. Such a stabilised set of interacting forces, which have achieved a definite rhythm of compensation, will react in unison to any outside influence, and, as no part of such a compensating system can be affected witho ut affecting all the rest, and causing th em to react, it will be seen that such an association functions as a unit. With regard to the tracks in space, howeve r, which have received the Logoidal impress (a nd may now be referred to as Divine Images - re flections - S parks from the Cosmic Fire - and will be referred to as Divine Sparks) the case is different. Let us take a single Div ine Spark and study its nature. It is expos ed to three sets of influences:- 1. The experie nces transmitted to it by th e seed-atom. 2. The influences of its fellow Divine Sparks. 3. It is `en rapport’ with the Logos. It is aware of the Logos, a nd the Logos is aware o f it. These influences are constantly changing in rhythms of different wave lengths, a nd the Divine Spark endeavours, by means of compensatory stresses, to blend all these into a regular t une. The Logoidal i nfluences change with the Cosmic Tides, which are very vast. The influences of the seed-atom are incomparably speedier, and the Divine Sp arks, its fellows, are all r eacting without correlati on to each other. The Cosmos phases reflected by the Logoidal Mind form"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"the first great stabilising influences, and the warr ing Sparks settle down to the tides of positive and negative phases, and gradually relationships are established, stress es are adjusted and compensated, and all Divine Sparks b ecome correlat ed among themselves in a `give and take’ of reactions. When this takes place, then evol ution has reached its zenith. Upon the `abstract’ aspect they present a perfect replica of the Logos at that stage o f its evol ution. And upon the `form’ side of things, a geometric form is pr esented built out of the atoms grouped about the nuclear seed-atoms, and this form is that to which the lines of force give rise, just as the crystal is a geometric form constructed by particles of matter arranged about lines of force. And as the Cosmos was built up out of three inter-revolving Rings, t he Logoidal symbol is spherical. And as the number of prime manifestation is three, the symbol of the first glob e is a three-sided figure - a three sided pyra mid within a sphere. You will thus perceive th at the first planetary form has been evolved. Upon the Cosmic aspect of things the position has been arrived at in which a Great Entity has developed a satellite. The Great Entity is aware o f its satellite. I ts consciousness conditions its sa tellite; and its satellite is aware o f the Great Entity. But, though the collective consciousness of the satellite is in fluenced by the Great Entity and therefore there is re action between Entity and satellite, it is not conscious of the Great Entity with its collective consciousness but with innumerable individualised consciousness es whose collective consciousness is m erely aware that they are aware, which is quite a different matter. There exists, t hen, in the satellite, a collective consciousness which is self-consci ous; aware of the conditions of its own existe nce as a satellite; a nd innumerable individual consciousness es which are aware of the conditions in the group of atoms gathered around the seed-atom with which t hey are associat ed but which are unaware o f the conditions of groups of atoms gathered around other seed-atoms, and which are also each and separately aware o f the Great Entity. The consciousness of the Great Entity towards its satellite r esembles the sight of a human eye, but the consciousness of the satellite towards the Great Entity resembles the sight of a spider’s eye - inn umerable facets reflecting inn umerable images which have to be focused in the brain. The brain correlating to grou p conscious ness. When all the Divine Sparks ar e perfectly adjusted to each other so that there is per fect reciprocit y of reaction through out their mass, then there is a collective conscious ness which f ocuses the images of the facets. When this is ac hieved there is reciprocal c onsciousness between the satellite an d the Great Entity, because they meet on equal terms. The form of the satellite has been determined by the Great Entity’s concept of itself, apart from the construc tive consciousness of the units composing it; and now the Divine Sparks, having attained reciproc al reaction, have achieved a collective focused consciousness and this consciousness functions as a unit and is therefore capable of objective consciousness , and the only object of its own pl ane within its sphere is the Great Entity. Now the Great Entity, being aware o f the conscious ness of the satellite, is aware o f the content of consciousness,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"which is th e sum total of the satellite’s experie nces, developing, which have already been recounted. The Great Entity, then, has become aware o f the evolution of a satellite, a nd this introduces a new factor into the consciousness of the Logoidal Mind, and this factor has to be assimilat ed to the rest of the content of conscious ness, a nd as stability has been reached by the satellite an d it has attained to a regular rhyth m, the monotony of the stimulus causing th e attention of the Great Entity to be withdrawn from it and conseque ntly free to attend exclusivel y to the assimilatio n of the new factor which it h as received int o its consciousness , and the satellite, b eing thus withou t extern al stimulus, sinks in to sub-conscious ness and thereby stereotypes its reactions. The Great Entity then, has sunk into subjective consciousness and is actively engaged in assimila ting the new factor, and again a chieving a synthesis o f consciousness. During this process all its forces are indrawn. It radiates nothing. It no longer ho lds its u niverse in c onsciousness. Therefore the universe is only held together by t he self- consciousness which that universe its elf has achieved d uring the inturning o f the attention of a Great Entity in the process of assimilating th e new idea presented to it by its u niverse. The universe is left to its own devices a nd therefore does not progress or change but constantly repeats the rhythm at which it h as arrived, a nd thereby stereotypes it, so that the equilibriu m of forces, at which it had arrived a t the time of the indrawing of the Great Entity’s attention, becomes set into form. The Great Entity, having thoroughly grasped and assimilat ed the new idea thus presented, in this case the idea of a three-fold unit - of a travelling atom with a consciousness upon one side and an enveloping bo dy upon the other - rous es itself from its introspection to the contemplation of a universe fashioned upon this model. The units of consciousness developed in the satellites are at once aware o f the new stimulus. They are aware o f the idea of action and reaction between a directing mind and an attached body, and upon this arc hetypal c oncept they proc eed to evolve. Thus a new se t of stresses is set up which overse ts the equilibriu m established in the group mind of that satellite, and therefore all the units composing that satellite a re dispersed and set out to follow the path again o f the wandering atoms but plus a Divine Spark of consciousness and a 6th plane body. The form of the archetypal satellite, however, which became stereotyped during th e inturning o f the Logos, remains as an archetypal f orm. This you may c onceive as circling about the Logos upon the 7th plane. The Divine Sparks, having progresse d outwards as far the 6th plane, by t heir rot ary movements gather around themselves new bodies of the 6th plane matter, and the process is repeated precisely as before, viz:- (a) The re-synthesis o f the Sparks. (b) The establishme nt of the compensating reactions, which constitutes group consciousness . (c) The reciprocal re actions of the group conscious ness and the Logoidal c onsciousness. (d) The in-turning of the Logos to assimilat e the new idea. (e) The stereotyping of the reactions of the satellite by"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"repetition. But there is this difference in the present case. During th e time that the evolu tion of the first satellite was proceeding th ere was no thing in existence in the universe, save the Logos, the satellite, and the planes of atoms. But during the evolution of the second satellite the first was undergoing a new phase of development. The Logos, h aving realised t he possibility of an endowment of atoms with the Logoidal likeness , thinks of the atoms in this way , and the atoms become thus endowed. Now the atoms of the 7th plane, as of all other planes, are continually undergoing a b ackwards an d forwards ti de-like movement, as the positive Logoidal p hases draw them towards t he centre, and the negative Logoidal p hases thrust them outwards. And as the attention of the dim conscious ness of the atoms is raised, in the positive phase of the Logos towards itsel f (for remember, that place in a projected thought-form universe, really means state) they receive the imprint of the Logos’ concept of them, and they are thus caused to vibrate i n the same rhythmic al tunes as the first evolving atoms had, at the time when the Logos became aware o f their content of consciousness. That is to say, at the conclusio n of their evolution. The new evolv ing atoms thus start where th e old ended. By the archetypal f orces of the first satellite they are speedily sorted into the same formation as their pre decessors, rapidly recapitulating their development. They have, then, but to arrive at a synthesis of reaction, which is collective co nscious ness, to become conscious of the Logos, and the same process is re peated as in the previous case. The first swarm o f atoms, having completed their evolution in the second satellite, as already describ ed, issue forth and undergo a third evolutio n upon the 5th plane. The second swarm in t he first satellite pr oceed likewise by the same path to the 6th plane and are there caught up and organised by t he already existing set of archetypal f orces left behind by th e first swarm. Meanwhile, a s the swarm o f atoms has been sent by t he Logos to people the first satellite, t he Logos now thinks o f atoms as having two enveloping s hells, an d so the new atoms are endowed with a capacity to gather about themselves matter of two pla nes. Thus the process goes on until the first swarm o f travelling atoms each surrou nded by an envelope of the matter of each plane upon which it h as evolved, h as built up a satellite upon the 1st plane, and each preceding satellite is peopled by hosts of Divine Sparks, each of which has built itself an envelope or series of envelop es according to the state of evolution at which it h as arrived. But the first swarm of Divine Sparks, by t he inherent forces of their natures, have devised t hemselves f orms, the Logos has become aware o f the fact and has sent out each succeeding swarm with the achievements of the first swarm implanted as archetypal ideas in their conscious ness. That is to say, that whatever rh ythms have been achieved ar e impacted as vibrations in each successive s warm. This is what is meant by Involuti on. Evolu tion is the expressio n of these in the matter of whatever plane it is u pon which evolutio n is proceeding. It will thus be seen from the foregoing, that in time, all the 6th plane atoms will undergo this process."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"You will note that, just as the symb ol of the satellite upon the 7th plane was a sphere with a three-sided solid figure - a pyramid with triangular sid es. The 6th plane is a four-sided figure, a cube - and so on down the planes. The 5th plane has a five-facetted figure. The 4th plane has a six-facetted figure. The 3rd plane a seven-facetted figure. The 2nd plane an eight-facetted figure. The 1st plane a nine-facetted figure. You will see that the numbers add up to ten, and that nine is the number of the sides of the facets forming the figure which s ymbolises the forces of the first plane. Therefore 3 times 3 is the perfect number in the first plane. Ten is the number of forces in manifestation for our universe but nine is the number of the Cosmic force which called that universe in to being when t hat force is ma nifested on the 1st plane. Chapter XV. Evolution of the First Planetary Form. In the previous lecture the evolu tion of the Divine Sparks was trac ed, from the time wherein all those of the same type gathered themselves toge ther and formed a grou p consciousness . We then traced the phases of the develo pments of these groups from one plane to another on each plane, adding a shell of the atoms of that plane to the concentric layers of atoms revol ving about the nucleus of the original travelling atom, until finally upon the 7th plane we find seven s hells about the central nu cleus of the Divine Spark. The relationships of the seed-atom, the travelling atom, and the seven shells ar e complex, and must receive further elucidation before we proc eed. The travelling atom is a projection, not of the Logos, but of the Cosmos. It is thus at the same time more primitive and more closely related to the ultimate source of existence than a projection of the Logos could be. The Logos pr ojects t he general f ramework o f forces and phases which co ndition the universe as a whole. The Cosmic atoms, which have c ome under the influence of the Logos, project the innumerable units, which t he Logoidal concept binds into an aggregate. The Cosmic atoms are really younger bre thren of the Logos - Cos mic uni ts themselves that have not reached the development which th e Logos has reached, but are of the same type. Therefore each atom of a Logoidal universe is, f or this reason, a potential Div inity. Remember now, that movement is the basis of all things. Abstract movements, which ar e opposed, lock u p force and render it static - fixed. It is these lock ed up forces which become`form’. A form is sim ply a force which is n ot free to move. Any series of changes which are completely compensatory settle down int o a cycle of action and reaction. As soon as such a cycle is e stablished it cannot change its mode of motion, and therefore a force is locked up, not in a motionless poi nt, but in a spinning Ring. The points are units. The Rings are organisms. Either a unit or a Ring, when o nce established, can move as a whole, and when this movement of an object takes plac e there are two f actors present, the object which m oves, a nd the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"movement it makes. The movement, apart from the object, is of the same nature as the movement which gave rise to the object. Whenever you get an unco-ordinated movement, such as the tangential move ment of atoms before they are co-ordinated, there is permanency of rhythms , and therefore no form is crea ted. But as soon as compensatory co-ordination is establishe d, forms of abstract movement are built. This principle a pplies to many considerations, and is therefore elaborated here in order that it may be available f or future reference, and when the abstract archetypes o f anything are referred to, you wi ll know that it is this replica of a rhythm that is impacted on another plane as a vibration which is referred to. This is the key to the nature of memory. Before proceeding further with the study of the evolution of the Divine Sparks, we w ill refer to the evolu tion of the archetypes of the globes or satellites, whos e origin has been describe d. The unifying of the Divine Sparks into a group consciousness gave rise, as aforesaid, to the organisa tion of their attendant atoms into correspo nding geo metrical form. After the dispersal of the atoms the archetypal f orm remains, according to the law above describ ed. This form is a miniature reflection of the Logos, u nder that aspect in which it is presented to its universe, that is to say, a system of stresses . This system of stresses organises the atoms of the plane of which it is, i nto its framework, and this equips its elf with a definite form. There will then exist, i n addition to the evolutionary swarm o f Divine Sparks, a Planetary Spirit w ith a spherical b ody, built up on a framework of stresses , and this Planetary Spirit will be profoundly imbued with the type of activity and organisation that was the characteristic o f the swarm o f the Divine Sparks during t hat phase of this evolu tion when they occupied its sphere. When the next swarm co mes to this phase they find that their evolutio n has to take place in relation to the Planetary Spirit which is t he Lord of that sphere, because it is the dominating influence thereon. They will, therefore, find ready made the conditions which their predecessors h ad to evolve, and they will start therefrom upon their own evolutio n. Each one, being equip ped with a shell of the matter of that plane, will, from this basis, pr oceed to gather about it a shell of the matter of the next plane. For rem ember, that although, in the Cosmos, the planes are extended in space, being based upon movement, in a universe t he atoms of the planes are not extended in space, being the products of an image held in consciousness , but are differentiated in type. It will thus be seen that the Divine Sparks do not have to change t heir place in space in order to gather a toms of another type about them, because atoms of all types are everywhere, b ut they mer ely have t o change their mode of motion in order to produce a type of movement in which th e atoms of another plane can take part. Whenever the co-ordination of movements takes place which ch anges a static uni t into a spinning Ring of cyclic rhythm, such a change takes place, and a cyclic rhythm always gathers about itself atoms of the plane below its own, b ecause its movement approximat es to theirs. For instance, as soon as a prime atom moves alo ng a tangential pa th it becomes a tangential atom. But supposing an"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"organisation of prime atoms moved along a tangential pa th, they would f orm a tangential mo lecule, and being larger than tangential atoms, would f orm a centre of attraction for those atoms, and would collec t a shell of attracted atoms about them. That is how all shells ar e built. To return, however, to the evolutio n of a Planetary Spirit, it wi ll possess, to begin with, merely an organise d sphere of the atoms of the plane on which it originated, and when the new evolutio nary swarm o f Divine Sparks reach it, they would f ind themselves with 7th plane bodies on the 7th plane planet. But in the course of their evolu tion in that planet they will build themselves 6th plane shells, a nd they will co- ordinate their conscious ness of these shells into a grou p consciousness , and when they depart on their evolutio nary journey, they will leave this group consciousness as an archetypal f orm in the consciousness of the Planetary Spirit, and this arc hetypal form will gather 6th plane atoms along its line of force, and the Planetary Spirit wi ll now have two bodies, because they are organised . This process is repeated with ea ch fresh phase of evolution, until each Planetary Spirit h as achieved its full complement of bodies and is, therefore, able to take a swarm through t he full circuit o f evolution. But as each Planetary Spirit is profoundly imbued with a type of activity which the swarm was engage d upon when its f orm was a building, each Planetary Spirit represents a different phase in evolu tion. They are therefore all different in character, and the evolutions conducted exclusivel y upon them have each a corresponding do minant note. For instance, on a 7th plane planet, the characteristics of the 7th plane will dominate all forms develope d thereon. The prime rhyth m of that plane will be the key note, and all subsequ ent rhythms will be multiples o f it. In a planet upon the 1st plane, the prime rhythm will be likewise the rhythm of that plane, but that rhythm, being a maxim um rhythm, all subsequ ent variations will be fractions of it, and on the intervening planes the prime rhythms will be as a decimal point. You will note that a swarm in evolu tion on a planet starts with the same number of bodies as that planet has, and builds an additional one in the course of its evoluti on, thereby endowing the planet with another body, until the maximum of seven is reac hed, and then devolutio n sets in wherein p lanets and Sparks divest th emselves of bodies. That subject will be dealt with later. You will also perceive th at the order of evolution in a universe is the opposite of the order o f evolution in the Cosmos, because a universe is re flected from the mirror consciousness of a Great Entity. Abstract movement gives rise t o forces in the Cosmos. Forms gi ve rise t o abstract movement in a universe, and thereby link themselves on to the Cosmos, of which more later. It is therefore essential in a universe, to have a form in order to evolve to Cosmic l evel, thereby enabling them to link themselves on to the Cosmic atoms that gave rise t o them, thereby making th ese Cosmic a toms into Great Entities. Thus do the atomic pl anes of the Cosmos evolve. This is the secre t of the God in man. He is rela ted primarily, not to the God of his universe, who is his conditioner, but his Creat or who is a correspo nding a tom in the Cosmos, who crea tes but has no power to condition, because it is itself conditioned by the Great Entity of which it f orms a part."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"But when the reflected atom of a universe develo ps a corresponding as pect to the nature of its Creat or and can thereby unite with it, that Cosmic atom receives int o itself all the conditions of the universe which was projected by the Great Entity of whose body it forms a part. And, as that universe is conditioned by the Great Entity, the Cosmic a tom thus becomes a replica of the Great Entity, and being thus completely conditioned by it, is n o longer being conditioned but has been conditioned, and therefore its conditioning is o f the past, and therefore in the present is unconditioned by the Great Entity, because it has achieved a state in which it conditions itsel f, and so is independent. It is made free of the Cosmic p lanes - is no longer held in bondage to the service of a Great Entity, but by means of this attachment of an evolved atom of a projected universe, it is raise d above the status of the atoms of its plane, and becomes, in its turn, a travelling atom, and together with its attached Divine Spark of the reflected universe, it makes the rounds of the Rays of the Cosmos, and thus, in its t urn, becomes a Great Entity and develo ps a universe. This is the goal o f the evolu tion of every reflected atom in a universe - to develop a Divine Spark - to complete the evolution from the human to the Divine in a reflected universe, and to unite with its Cosmic Creator, thus enabling th e Cosmic atom to evolve through the phase of a travelling atom into a Great Entity. It is this scheme of evolutio n which we are now considering. These last details have never been reveale d before. Human thought ha s never before passed beyond the conditioning Log os, but it is now revealed that, though the Logos is t he Creator of an universe, each atom in that universe is separately created by a separate Cosmic a tom, which aspires, by means of that reflected Life, to achieve a state whereby it can continue its own evolutio n. Therefore, it can be said of man that, by eating of the Tree of Knowledge, they should be as Gods. It is this knowledge which ha s been withheld on the outgoing pa th of evolutio n lest s ouls should be tempted to turn back and forestall th eir goal, but to those who p assed the nadir, it can now be reveale d. Chapter XVI. Evolution of the Lords of Flame, Form and Mind. We are now in a position to reconsider in greater detail the evolution of a Divine Spark. Let it be noted, to begin with, that the first swarm of Divine Sparks, di ffers from its successor i n many respects. To begin with, the first swarm is composed of the travelling atoms of the universe. Secondly, these Divine Sparks ar e subjected to no other influences than those of the Logos itsel f. Because, satellites not having been developed, they are not expos ed to the influences of the Planetary Spirits. Therefore the Sparks o f the first swarm have the Divine Image impresse d on them in all its purity , unblurred by ot her influences. There is a n absence of cross curre nts in the influences which pl ay upon the first swarm which ca uses them to attain to the Divine Ideal with m uch less stress and effort than their successors. In their composition the influences of the Cosmos predominate. Each subsequent swarm, howeve r, performs its"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"evolution in a more highly evolved universe, a nd therefore the influences of the Cosmos find a potent rival in the influences of the universe. Another point in which t he evolu tion of the first swarm differs from the evolution of any subseque nt swarm is this - the first swarm gat hers the material ou t of which th eir bodies are made from the undifferentiated atoms of the plane on which they evolve, th ey thus carry on these atoms with th em to the next globe of their evolution , and so on through out the planes. So that upon each glob e upon which they evolve the potentialities of reaction corresp onding to all the planes above it in the universe are established, by th e methods previously explain ed. These Divine Sparks, t hus passing down the planes leave behind them a series o f Archetypes, and when they pass back up the planes by a method to be describe d hereafter, they become the Powers and Potencies who c onduct the evolutio n of their successors. These are the Lords, the Principalities , the Regents of whom you have heard. The method of evolutio n of the subsequent swarms differs from those of the Archetypal Sparks. The Logos, having received from the Archetypal S parks the concept of their evolutionary achievem ent, impacts this upon the Divine Sparks of the second swarm, by th e method of vibration previously describ ed, so that they start out on their evolution with the innate capacities f or reaction laboriously built up by their predecessors, and find themselves un der the influence of a sphere of forces which the activities of the atomic portion of their predecessors f ormed into the sphere of a satellite. They, in their turn, collect s hells of the matter of the plane about their vortices in the course of their evolu tion. But there is this point of difference, that they have not got to build a group mind out of their conscious nesses. They have merely got to attune themselves to one which already exists. They have got t o become at-one with th eir sphere, which incl udes the influences of the previous swarm, a s well as their own swarm, a nd not merely at-one with themselves. When this at-onement is achieved and the Logos h as contemplated the result a nd turned inwards t o his subjective meditation, these Sparks d o not continue in the sphere of the satellite, as did their pre decessors o f the first swarm, but, the Logoidal attraction being withdrawn, t he mass of the globes upon the next plane attracts them, and they are disengaged f rom the centripetal forces of the globe on which they are, and pass onwards. Upon the next glob e they take up the next phase of their evolution in precisely the same way as their predecessors. Again recapitulate their pre decessors b ehaviour, up to the point of departure, to the 5th plane globe . Here a change occurs. The second swarm, having arrived at the second glob e of their evolutio n, do not pass on to the third immediately, but are now exposed (the Logoi dal attraction being withdrawn into the subjective state) to two sets of planetary influences - t hose of the 1st and 3rd glob es (the first swarm alwa ys keeping a globe ahead of them). They are therefore pulled two ways, and this conflicting influence is sufficient to overcom e the attraction of the individual atoms for their atomic shells. The atomic shells t hen fall to pieces, and return to their original condition a s atoms of the plane to which th ey belong, but, though they are freed from the influence of the Divine Sparks, they are immediately caught up by the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"influence of the forces of the sphere in which that evoluti on has taken place, and are retained therein. Thus upon the 6th plane a Planetary Spirit will have, not only the 6th plane atoms held along its line o f forces, but also the 7th plane atoms shed by the Divine Sparks. A Planetary Spirit, be it noted, is really the Group Spirit of the life that evolves in its sphere. The Divine Sparks that are thus robbed of their atoms, are reduced to their original state of a 7th plane atom attached to a Divine Spark, and in this state conseque ntly re-enter the sphere of the manifesting of the Unmanifest, which, in a n universe, corresp onds to the Central Stillness of the Cosmos, and therein they receive anew the impress o f the Logoidal Image, plus the fruits of the evolu tionary achievements of the Archetypal S parks. The Archetypal Sparks bei ng always a plane ahead of their evolu tion. The second swarm Sp arks alwa ys start out on their new round with the potentialities o f reaction of an additional plane. As they pass out through the phases they therefore gather about them the matter of each plane they pass through, forming it in to concentric sh ells, as has been previously describe d, until they arrive at the 5th plane. There they build up a shell of 5th plane matter with th e influence of the 5th plane planet, and repeat the process of assimilation to the Group Mind, the shedding of the shells, a nd the return to the Centre. It will now be perceived t hat there is a fundamental difference between each swarm. The first swarm is e ngaged solely with magnetic action and reaction and vibrations, and they are called in the technical terms of Occultis m, “The Lords of Flame”. The second swarm are concerned with the building of matter into the form of the Planetary Spirits, a nd they are called “The Lords of Form”. We will now de al with the third swarm. They issue forth, as before -7th plane atoms, stamped with a Logoidal I mage of a more evolved type t han either of their pre decessors, because the Logos has evolved by means of the evolutio n of their predecessors. They proceed to the planetary sphere of the 7th plane, and herein the difference of their evoluti on from their predecessors b ecomes apparent, for they do not collec t the matter of the sphere to form a body, but use only that matter which is un der the influence of the Planetary Spirit in whose sphere they are evolving, and as this matter is a ccustomed to react to an Ensouling Divine Spark, it is m uch easier to manipulate than the matter of space. Therefore evolution is more rapid. But as these Div ine Sparks ca nnot advance to the globe beyond that upon which they are evolving until the preceding swarm h as moved on, they are compelled to remain upon the globe of their evolutio n after they have exh austed its possibilities o f reaction, and the superabundant energies, t o whom the evolv ing channel is close d, make play among themselves. This is the first instance of free-will within the Cosmos, and its resultant activities building indiv idualised reactions into atoms, is c alled epigenesis. This is the first occasion on which the atoms are differentiated one from another, and this leads to the applying to this swarm of the name ”Lords of Mind”, b ecause individualised exp erience is the basis of personality. It will here be seen that a new evolving princip al is introduced, which is that the checking of progress in one"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"direction by preventing it from becoming mor e elaborate upon the original type, lifts, or sublimates it to a new aspect. If, however, the checking be too long continued it would c ause it to revert to a more primitive type. This, howeve r, cannot occur at the present phase because the synthesis o f forces upon these planes is per fect, but is merely referred to in passing in order that the correspondences m ay be seen. The process of evolving a new aspect of a checked force is called sublimation. The process o f returning to a simpler type of evolutio n is called degrada tion, and is alwa ys harmful, because the capacities of reaction acquired a t a more advanced level cannot be controlle d or checked by th e governing forces of a more primitive state,and develop a n extreme individualism, thus breaking up the synth esis of force on the plane on which they find themselves. You will, of course, perceive that it is the same type of process which se ts free a travelling atom for its evolution to a higher st ate of existence. But a travelling atom has completed the circuit before it undergoes t his exp erience, and may be termed “The Child of the Cosmos” - or “ The Universe” - a s the case may be ; born at full term. And the regressive, or degrade d atom is bor n out of due time - an abortion. If it lives at all, it lives as monster. This is the origin o f certain types of devil. These matters will be dealt with f ully in their proper place, and are merely referred to here in order that the correspondences may be seen. Fortunately the balance at this phase of evolution we are discussing is perfectly adjusted, because the influence of the Logos is t he only influence in the universe. Therefore, no such retrogression can take place among the primal swarms. I t is to epigenesis i n a transition state that we owe th e origin o f evil in a universe. Thus the swarms p ass on. The Lords of Flame leaving behind them galvanic stresses of all types. The Lords of Form leaving behind them a sediment of atoms which are built into great spherical shells by the galvanic stress es, so that each plane is dominated by a set of galvanic stress es which develop into a Planetary Spirit. And a set of the shells of the matter of other planes held into a form or body by that Planetary spirit, which develop i nto a planet, as known to Astrology. But be it noted, that each planet, although it ul timately possess es matter of all seven planes, has a Planetary Spirit formed of the stresses o f the plane on which it is. Thus the Planetary Spirit of the 5th plane would b e an abstract mind, and the Planetary Spirit of the Earth is an etheric double. We have now trac ed the three primary swarms of the outgoing arc, and you wi ll see how each carries a new factor from plane to plane. The first swarm - t he Lords of Flame - do not return to the central point of manifestation until they have c ompleted the Round. Have b een down t he planes, and back up the planes, and have thus completed their evolutio n. The second swarm, or L ords of Form, only return to the central p oint of manifestation after they have recapitulated their evolutio n and mastered an additional plane. That is to say, in their first outgoing, th ey progress through two globes and return. In their second outgoing - through three globes and return, and so on. Always following on the wake o f the first"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"swarm, with whose evolu tion they synchronise . Because, as soon as the first swarm h as achieved a new factor, the Logos assimilat es it, and enters a subjective phase to do so. During th at phase, as previously said, the universe is left to its own d evices. The first swarm, upon its glob e, settles down to stereotype its reactions, and it is the influence of that organise d globe in an otherwise unorganised universe, which breaks up the shells of the second swarm in the preceding globe and so sends them back to the central point of manifestation. Likewise the progress of the third swarm is synchro nised, because they have to wait for the second swarm t o withdraw from a planet before they can advance to it. The evolution of the first swarm is slowest because it is all original work for them. The second swarm occupy much time in their evolutio n because they are constantly recapitulating, and gathering up and breaking in, new matter of the different planes, and therefore synchronise well enough with th e progress of the first swarm. But the third swarm ha s much of its evolutionary work already done for it, and therefore has to wait. He nce it elaborates itsel f. Elaboration means differentiation, and differentiation means Personality. Chapter XVII. The Influence of the Regen ts upon the Globes. Having traced the evoluti on of the Lords of Flame as far as the 7th globe, which t hey form upon the 1st plane, we will now trace the course of their return to the centre. It will be perceived t hat, by their nature they have built those systems of magnetic stresses which constitute the framework o f the globes , and are afterwards ela borated into Planetary Spirits. On their return journey they travel back along the line of globes by which th ey came out. There is this difference, however. Instead of building th emselves a form in the matter of that plane they find the form already built, but they also find it inhabited by th e succeeding swarm of Divine Sparks who ar e undergoing evoluti on thereon. So that, on the 6th globe, two sets of lives are being lived. The second swarm on the outward arc, a nd the first swarm on the arc of returning. The first swarm, e ntering into the already prepared Group Mind have subjective consciousness. The second swarm, e ngaged i n building a Group Mind, have subjective co nscious ness only. Therefore, they are not aware o f their companions of the first swarm who als o inhabit this glob e, though they live in their influence; which has the effect of imparting t o the shells of the matter of that plane, which h ave formed about the Divine Sparks, t he same type of vibration as the seed-atoms of the first swarm are themselves v ibrating to. This is the familiar phenomenon of the impactation of a cyclic rhythm inducing a vibration . When this condition has been arrived at , the second swarm, b eing ab le to vibrate t o the same rhyth m as the first, become aware o f the members of the first - not by direct perception, but by perc eption of the changes of the outermost shell ind uced by the presence of the first. This, howeve r, does not occur u ntil the end of the period of evolution whereupon both swarms quit th at planet; the second to advance to the 7th globe, and the first to return to the 5th. In addition to the influence they exert u pon their"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"fellow sojourners i n a glob e, the first swarm have certain evolution to undergo on their own account. On their outward journey they have c ollected to themselves shells o f each plane, which th ey have not shed but have carried o ut with them. And on the return journey each shell forms a means of reaction to the matter of each plane on which th ey find themselves. B eing capable of both action and reaction these form vehicles of manifestation and means of perception. Thus the indwelling Spark is abl e to act on, and react to, the matter of each plane on which it finds itself, and, though it carried out its evolu tion in the sphere of attraction of the glob e on that plane, it can yet exte nd its activities a certain way beyond the sphere of the influence of that globe. This is a point whose signific ance will be seen later. Upon each globe , upon the return journey, the Sparks of the first swarm exercise their influence upon the shells that are be-ga thered about the Sparks of whatever swarm t hey encounter there. Upon the 6th globe they meet the second swarm. When they themselves depart to the 5th globe, the third swarm advance to the 6th globe, and so on. They just miss each other. So that the third swarm is distinguish ed by this peculiarity - it never meets the Lords of Flame. It never encounters an evolution higher than its own, an d therefore its predominating influence is t hat of the Logoidal I mage, and of the production of its own e pigenesis. That is why Mind has so much freedom as compared with Form or Force. It will be seen that, as each swarm meets the Lords of Flame on a different planet, it is a different shell that is influenced by them. This accounts for the differences in organisation of the vehicles u pon the different waves. It is a point closely connected with practical m agic, because whatever body has received t he impress of the Lords of Flame, that body will be used in workin g upon Nature Forces. The Lords of Form likew ise, when developing up on a globe, exert a similar in fluence upon their fellow sojourners there, but being pe culiarly and intimately related to the matter of that globe, their inter-reactio n with the shells of the Sparks o f the junior swarm is p eculiarly intimate. When, however, the Lords of Mind have p assed the nadir and begin to return up the globes, conditions of evolutio n are much complicat ed, because the freedom of individual action of the Divine Sp arks has been enormously developed by succ essive periods of epigenesis, an d in their diversity of reactions they produce the diversity of development in the swarms t hey contact. Chapter XVIII. The Goal of Evoluti on of a Life Swarm. We have trac ed the progress o f the first three Life Swarms a s far as the 1st plane. We will now trace the mode of their ret urn up the planes. It will be recalled that the Lords of Mind complete the full cycle before returning to the sphere of Divine influence wherefrom they issued. The Lords of Form evolved by means of a gradually lengthening series o f journeys. In the first journey they progress as far as the 6th plane and return ag ain to the sphere of Divine influence. On the second journey they progress through two glob es to the 5th plane, and so on down the planes until, on the 6th journey they reach the 1st plane. It will thus be perceived that upon the seventh journey of their outgoing th ey have alre ady within th emselves the capacities of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"reaction of all the planes and have nothing further to acquire in that respect. They have, however, to learn the lessons of the return journey, which will be dealt with in t heir place. The evolu tion of the Lords of Mind res embles that of the Lords of Flame in that it is a continuous journey, but at each pause, while th ey wait th eir turn for progress, they make original a dditions to the sum of factors of their reactionary complex. It will have been noted that, from the time the first swarm se t out on its homeward jo urney, two evolutio ns will always be progressing in a globe at the same time, and the senior evoluti on profoundly influences that aspect of the junior evolution which c orresponds to its own n ature. This is the prototype of the process known as Initiation. These matters cannot be dealt with in d etail until other aspects of the subject have been considered. They will then be reverted to. It will be remembered that upon each plane the Divine Sparks a cquired a fresh mode of reaction. They learnt of a plane, but were limit ed by th e conditions o f that plane. Upon the return arc they are not seeking t o penetrate into, and master the conditions of a fresh plane as a means of evolutio n, but to withdraw from a plane and thus to free themselves from its limitations, while at the same time retaining the capacities for reaction they learnt thereon. This freedom can only be obtained after the complete synth esis of reactions of that plane has been achieved by t he Group Spirit o f the swarm. The synth esis is so complete that the reactions, being mutually compensating, b ecome automatic, and demand no individual compensating. Habitude renders them sub-conscious , and the consciousness of the Sparks, being direct ed to the reactions of a higher pl ane, they function according to the type of that plane, and their reactions are such that the atoms of the lower plane can no longer accommodate themselves thereto and therefore are dispersed. In this way the Lords of Flame withdraw up the planes. The Lords of Form progress by a different type of evolution. For each lesson they learn they teach to the Logoidal c onsciousness before progressing further, and they await the impact of the Logoidal Image which is th e evoluti onary impulse which sends them forth on their journey. When they have been out to the uttermost plane and returned for the sixth ti me they have gi ven their final message to the Logoidal consciousness ; and the sevent h journey, which, as far as they are concerned is a repetition, can add nothing anew to the Logoidal c onsciousness. It is their function, however, upon each globe to make a contribution to the forces of formation in the manifested universe. Their essential type of reaction is the stereotyping of forms and they influence profoundly the atoms that are built into the plane body of the Planetary Spirits of each globe . The Lords of Flame influence the evolv ing Life Sparks of each globe they are on. The Lords of Form leave them untouched, but influence the globe itself. Were it not so this stereotyping o f form would pr event evolution in the Divine Sparks. As it is, t he stereotyping of form in the vehicles o f the Planetary Spirits ha s determined in them the most primitive type o f vehicle o f manifestation - the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"sphere - an inorganic a ccretion of matter around a nucleus of attraction. It is the Lords of Mind, however, who exert the predominating in fluence on the swarms t hey contact on each plane, because, owing to the fact that they have achieved individualisation , they are able to act upon individual S parks and are not merely obliged to influence a Group Mind t hrough a general atmosphere. It is a peculiarity of all vibratory objects that they tend to tune with their own v ibrations all objects of a slower rhythm than themselves, being only limited in this activity by the vibrationary capacity thus influenced. And whereas the Lords of Flame were limit ed in their power to raise vibration ary activities by th e sum total Group reaction, the Lords of Mind, (should individual junior sparks s how special re actionary capacities) are able to raise them individually . The sparks thus develop ed exercise a profound influence on the Life swarm of which th ey form a part, for they are Initiates. On the outgoing arc of evolution Initiation is performed by contact with the Life of a swarm o n the returning arc. Thus Initiation enables the Initiate to cut across th e arc of evolution, and to obtain the reactionary capacities by sympathetic induction, instead of the lengthy process of experience . Initiation on the returning arc is, howeve r, a different process, which will be considere d in due course. The function of Initiates on the outgoing arc is to enable their swarms to adapt themselves more speedily to the condition of a newly achieved plane, because they have acquired some concept of the nature of these conditions. Thus Initiation on the outgoing arc enables an Initiate to immerse himself more readily in matter. Let us now consider the condition of the first swarm when it returns on ce more to the sphere of Divine influence. It issued forth as a cloud of Sparks. It returns as an organised s et of magnetic, capillary, mass-mo mentum, centrifugal, c entripetal, and vertical stress es. The Logos is t hen confronted by an organisatio n that approximates in influence to its own. W hatever reac tions the Logos m ay impose upon its universe w ill encounter the organised opposition of the first swarm. The Logos, h owever, works no t in opposition to that which it h as itself created, but acts as a synthesiser be tween the Cosmos by which it is influenced, and the organisatio n which now f orms a conditioning influence in its universe. By its perception of this organisati on a corresponding im age rises in its c onsciousness, and the Great Entity is thus conditioned by the conditions of its universe, and therefore all Cos mic influences are transmuted under the influence of that conditioning before they are communicated to the universe. The Logos has now acquired the same reactionary capacities, by co ntemplation of the evolved swarm, that the swarm acquire d by experience of the planes. Therefore the Divine Entity and the Divine Ma nifestation vibrate synchron ously and are at-one; and, after a period of compensating action and reaction, they evolve a r hythm. The Logoidal vibratio ns are extended to the Group Spirit of the swarm, and the Group Spirit of the swarm is a bsorbed in the consciousness of the Great Entity. The individual Sparks, howeve r, maintain their"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"individuality but their Group Spirit is no longer a separate Entity but has become at-one with it, a nd therefore it is a t-one with the Logoidal c onsciousness, so that the oversoul o f the swarm is t he Logos its elf. This is the goal o f evoluti on of a Life swarm, the at- one-ment of the Group Soul with the Logoidal conscious ness, whereby the Logos received t he fruits of the evolution . It may n ow be asked `Whither go t he Sparks?’ In the case of the Lords of Flame they are so completely withdrawn from the manifested universe that they cease to be upon the planes of manifestation but remain at the central poi nt of impactation, maintaining a balancing ac tion and reaction between the Manifest and the Unmanifest. Some, however, succeed in making contact with t heir corresp onding Cosmic a toms and these pass out of the sphere of Logoidal evolu tion to experience the life of a Travelling atom in the Cosmos. Those that do not so proceed remain as conditioning influencers in the universe and, being at-one with t he Logoidal Mind, ar e able to execute the Logoidal Will. The forms which th ey built in the course of their evolutio n form part of the framework of the universe, a nd as such, are stereotype d. But, whenever the Logos desires to effect compensatory actions in response to the unco-ordinated responses of an evolv ing universe, it is by means of the Lords of Flame thus freed from the bonds of manifestation that this is achieved. “And He made His Ministering Spirits a flame of fire” and “Flames of Fire were His Ministering Spirits”. The Lords of Flame are concerned in basic Nat ural Forces . The Lords of Form likew ise, on completing their evolution, undergo similar a djustments, and when the Logos, having received a new concept from an evolv ing swarm, d esires t o impress a n archetypal concept upon a swarm in pr ocess of evolution, it is the Lords of Form that are employed for the process. Their method we will study later. The Lords of Mind likewise, upon their ret urn, are assimilat ed to the Divine Consci ousness, and employed as Mediators between the Logos and His universe. Now be it recalle d that the Lords of Mind e stablishe d individuation, and they deal essentially as individuals with individuals. Whereas the Lords of Form d eal with Group Souls. The Lords of Mind are the Initiators o f our pres ent evolution and as such, will receive much reference in the course of these teachings. They it is, who, a ble to react upon all planes of manifestation, range u p and down t he planes, performing adjustments by exercising compensatory stress es when the faculty of epigenesis h as disordered an evoluti on. Upon a plane where th ey function they are simply a centre of force, therefore they are unperceived by the denizens of that plane. They can, howeve r, by the assistanc e of a vehicle o f that plane, detach certain elements to form nuclei for the building of vehicles in the matter of that plane. Hence the concept of the Virgin birth. And therefore it is that those who are known as the `Saviours’ are always represented as born of agamogenesis. They bring t heir own lif e impulse. Nothing but the accre tion of matter is required for their ma nifestation. In this outline we h ave traced the development of a manifested universe up to the point where the Divine Sparks of the prime swarms h ave returned to the Logos - ac hieved a t-one- ment and function as intermediaries between the Logos and His universe. It will be recalled that the Logos has three prime"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"aspects. Each of the three prime swarms was projec ted into manifestation under an impulse of one of the prime aspects of the Logos a nd may therefore be regarded as the representative of that aspect to the universe. These three prime manifestations are of a different degree t o all the others. Subsequent Life swarms develo p under the Logos plus the Regents and as, in addition to the three prime aspects derived from the Rings of the Cosmos, the Logos a lso reacts to the influence of the twelve Cosmic R ays, subsequent evol utions are characterised by th e influence of the Rays which pre dominated at the time when t hey received th e Logoidal impulse. As these Cosmic impulses are rec eived by the Logos by means of the Zodiacal Initiations, the Group Spirits of the swarms th us developed are known as `Star Logoi’. These are clos ely concerned with types in the evolv ing Sparks. It will thus be seen that each swarm, a fter it has achieved a t-one-ment with the Logos, performs the part of Compensator or Counterpoise in the work of evoluti on, for, with the coming in of epigenesis, c omes also the risk of developments out of harmony with the Logoidal Nature. Likewise these evolved swarms are employed to convey to the outgoing Sparks the fruits of evolution that have been achieved, and thus save a needless rec apitulation of reactions already stereotyped in the universe. We have now co ncluded a descriptio n in outline of the evolution of the Logos and His Regents who condition all future evolutions. This concludes the second section of the teaching. Section 3. Chapter XIX. Tabulated Summary of Influences. 1. Logoidal I nfluences. (a) Cos mic influences acting on the Logos, the Rings, a nd the Rays as exemplified by the Zodiac, and other Great Entities. (b) Modifications of Logoidal consciousness produced by reactions to the evoluti on of the manifested universe. 2. The Influences of the Manifested Universe. (a) Plane conditions. (b) Influences of Star Logoi. (c) Influences of Planetary Spirits. (d) Influences of other evoluti ons sharing the same planet. 3. Factors of the Manifested Universe. These factors are stereotypes o f reactions which always function on appropriate occasions. Being built up by preceding evolutions, they form the inheritance of each subsequent evolution, and are innate capacities. There are very many. We will enumerate certain of the major ones:- (a) Law of action and reaction - equal a nd opposite. (b) Law of Limitations. (c) Law o f the Seven Deaths. (d) Law of Impaction or the transmission o f action from one plane to another. (e) Law of the aspects of force, or Polarity. (f) Law of Attraction of outer space. (g) Law of the Attraction of the Centre. Under the influence of these factors evolution proceeds, and to terms of these factors it can be reduced. The Logoidal i nfluence predominating a t the time that a new phase is being develo ped determines t he type of life or vehicle evolved."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Chapter XX. Cosmic Influences. We are now considering the influences under which hu man evolution takes place. You are accustomed to the concepts of Astrology which delineate the planetary influences affecting the personality. The subject of our discussio n is, the Cosmic in fluences affecting the individuality, which may be termed `sidere al astrology ’ in distinction from planetary astrology . You have no doubt realised from previous t eaching that the universe evol ves subject to the determining in fluence of the Logoidal c onsciousness, and that the Logoidal conscious ness experiences in its turn the influence of the Cosmic tides. Therefore the universe is mo dified indirectly by the action of the Cosmic ti des. The Cosmic ti des consist o f influences of the positive and negative phases of the Rings. These phases affect the Cosmos as a whole, so that the twelve Cosmic Rays and the seven Cosmic planes function alternately with th eir positive and negative aspects predominating. W hich means that when the positive phase predominates, the forces of action - the apex shall we say - may b e conceived of as in the centre. W hen the negative predominates the apex is a t the circumference. Thus in a positive phase a circuit would c onsist of an inflowing and outgoing. I n a negative phase, an outgoing a nd inflowing. The action of a Ray therefore, differs greatly according to whether it be experience d under a positive or a negative phase of the Rings. So that a Great Entity may b e conceived of as circling round the Cosmos in its or bit, and receiving the influence of the Rays as it passes through their areas, but receiving them alternately under their positive an d negative as pects. The evolu tion proceeding in t he universe wi ll be correspondingly modified according to whether that evolutio n takes place when t he Logos is exp eriencing a positive or negative Cosmic i nfluence. The calculating o f these influences constitutes sidereal astrology . This is the astrology which rel ates to the lives and fates of Group Souls and Planetary Spirits. I t concerns the nativities of the Heavenly Bodies themselves. The basis o f this calculatio n is the precessio n of the equinoxes. The equinoxes an d the Cosmic R ay phases correlat e, and there are four phases to a Ring phase. On that basis you ca n calculate out the sidereal influences affecting evolutio n. Remembering this, however, that these influences do no affect human lives directly , but affect the planetary Spirits wh ich, in their tur n, influence the mental and karmic at mosphere in which a soul reacts. And the Planetary Spirits themselves are modified by the tracks in s pace described about them by the evolution of a Group Soul of any Life Swarm that is progressing through t heir sphere. So that, although the Logoidal in fluences are remutable, modifications of these influences ar e introduced in the course of transmissio n. So that the astrology of the ancients, though fundamentally true, is not strictly accurate at the present day. The develo pments caused by evolution must be allowed for. Therefore, those aspects which, in primitive times might be interpreted as war and bloodshed, at the present time might be interpreted as a conflict of ideas. The Planetary aspects at the time of the Darwinian c ontroversy would h ave meant war at an earlier st age."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Sidereal astrology should always be calcula ted in relation to the Race before any horoscope of an individual o f that Race is cast. Group Mind and Group Souls are subject to sidereal astrology . Individuals t o planetary plus sidereal astrology . Work out the equinoctial po sitions. From that you c an calculate the Ring in fluence. This will enable you to know whether the Heavenly House is in its positive or negative aspect, and this will tell you what aspect of the Logos is i n function. Whatever aspect be thus energised will stimulate the corresponding as pects in all m anifestations. Breaking down a nd building up aspects depend on the Cosmic Rings, an d the particular form of destructio n or construc tion depends on the Cosmic R ay. These prime conditions underlie all others and frequently falsify the best made calculatio ns. In addition to these, the regular and calculable influences of the Cosmos, there are the irregular in fluences caused by the passing o f other Gre at Entities upon other spheres or planes of the Cosmos, as previousl y referred to. You will find the particulars on this subject in a previous c hapter. There is n o method which you are capable of grasping whereby such influences can be reduced to a calcula ble system , but they will be found to correlate with the approach of the comets. Some, therefore, are known to you, f or some of the comets have their orbits calculated. Some are still unknown to human thought, but give adequate notice of their approach by the disturbances induced in other heavenly bodies. The astrology of the comets have been but little worked out and would re pay attention. The best method of calculatio n is through t he spectrosco pic record of a comet. This will enable its chemical c omposition to be deduced, and the proportions o f the elements will give the necessary clue to the nature, especially the proportion of the metals, which, b eing referred to their appropriate corresp ondences, will furnish the key to the problem of good and evil, th e fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Thus it can be seen of what the force is the support or pillar, for that which it s upports will have its a ctivity intensified, so that, that which should be a negative phase may unexpec tedly become positive. The basis of calculation of sidereal astrology, then, is the equinoxes, s ubject to irregular m odifications of other Great Entities, many of which c an be calculated by m eans of the comets. The comets, it may be said, are aggregates of atoms drawn together by means of the electrical disturbance occasioned by the influences of Entities upon subtler planes. That is to say, Great Cosmic Beings t hat have no matter of the 7th Cosmic plane in their composition and therefore cannot form a universe which is perc eptible to the senses of a 1st plane Solar evolution. These comets do not generate a Group Soul which can evolve. They are sidereal idiots. Artificial elementals are their souls, and they are concerned - cert ain of them - with Cosmic scavenging. To them are sent those rare u nits of an evolution which, by t he persistent misuse of epigenesis, have dedicated themselves to destruction . The comet, in its orbit, takes such souls to the outermost bounds of the Cosmos wherein there are no influences to which t hey can react, and the Cosmic"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"atom-images, which go t o the building of their component parts, cease to be reflected. That is the unknown d eath. Such units cease to be - completely, and there is n o reincarnation, or fresh start. Even their kar ma is disi ntegrate d and touches not the Group Spirit. It is said of such that they exchange their planet for a comet. They elect to go far and fast, but they go too far and too fast for their forces of cohesion, and the comet to which t hey have yoked themselves, when it returns ag ain to the sphere of our solar system, is found to be without them. Solar evoluti ons proceeding fr om the Solar Logos - which is your Go d - synchro nise roughly with th e Ring in fluences of the Cosmos. That is to say that under the positive Cosmic influences the Logos will give the stimulus which sends a new swarm u pon its journey, but the length and speed of that journey synchro nise thenceforth with nothing els e, because there are so many counter-acting influences, save t hat it will have to make its passage thr ough the nadir at a time when the Cosmic tides are turning. Bu t it may have one or more Cosmic phases upon its outgoing arc. The change of a phase will always precipitate an evolutionary crisis, b ut until a Cosmic tide-turn occurs, when an evolu tion is a pproaching the limit of its developmental capacities, it wi ll not venture over th e dead centre, but will perform epige nesis a nd bide its time. Those Beings which ess ayed the task of passing the nadir under unfavourable influences failed to make the transition, reverted along the original path when the Cosmic tide came later, and become demons and devils. Hence the distinction of the Left Hand Path. The left hand path can be gained in two way s, by deliberate crossi ng of the arc from right to left after the nadir has been passed, or by retroversion before the nadir has been passed. This has reference to the squaring of the Lodge. You will see by this that it is n ecessary to watch t he Cosmic tides when u ndertaking any regenerative wo rk in relation to the spiritual guid ance of humanity. The great constructive period of the 19th century afforded a valua ble starting ground for any spiritual impulses. The first quarter of the 20th century was a phase of destruction. You will observe that movements upon all different phases that took their rise duri ng that period, especially during its middle years, h ave come to naught. The concepts may have been sound, but the season was u npropitious. Chapter XXI. The Logoidal R elation to the Manifested Universe. It will be realised from the study of the foregoing papers that the Logos is related sub-consciously to the Cosmos and consciously to the universe. Re membering also that the Logos is a ffected by the positive an d negative Cos mic phases, you will perceive that under the negative influence its consciousness will tend to subjectivity and therefore the Cosmic influences wi ll predominate in the Logoidal consciousness . At the same time that the Logoidal influences will be withdrawn to a great extent from the manifested universe which will be left to the control of forces which it had itself genera ted in the course o f its evolution . These periods are referred to as the days an d nights of Brahma. Be it noted, however, that there are the greater and lesser nights."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The relation of the Logos to his universe wi ll be best realised by re membering th at a phase of evoluti on is to the Logos what a n incarnation is to a man. The forthsending and returning of an evolutionary Life Swarm c onveys the same harvest o f experience to the Logoidal consciousness as the individuality of a man receives from the incarnating personality. The Logos its elf corresp onds to the Divine Spark. The universe, in its group soul aspect, to the individuality. The evolu tionary swarm t o the personality. Bearing th ese corresp ondences in m ind, you wi ll be able to interpret the Logos in the light of the man, and the man in the light of the Logos. The formation, develo pment, and devolutio n of a universe corresponds to the evolution ary cycle of the Logos, so that the Logos develops by me ans of a series o f incarnating impulses which are evolutio nary life waves or swarms. Each succeeding evoluti on penetrates deeper into the `form’ aspect of the universe; re nders it more complex in its organisation; brings it t o a stage further in the development of that perfect balance of forces which it is e nabled to reach as a whole. When the entire manifested universe a cts as a whole it is fully self-conscious . And soon as self-conscious ness is established , objective conscious ness becomes possible. The universe then becomes aware o f the Cosmos. Reciproc al consciousness between Logos and universe is es tablished . We have then, first, the self-conscious L ogos. Secondly, in order that the Logos may e stablish obj ective consciousness , the need of an object of which it can be conscious. The Logos, therefore, projec ts its concept of itself and becomes conscious o f that. The concept, in its turn, develops self-consciousness through succ essive phases of evolution. The Logos is aware o f these changes a s they take place, and is modified by the knowledge. Finally the universe, h aving attained full self- consciousness , becomes objectively conscious and is aware o f the Logos. B ut as the Logoidal conscious ness has developed, step by step, with a universal c onsciousness , they are identical, the only distinction being that the Logos has a background of Cosmic conditions, and the universal consciousness has a background of mundane conditions. The Logos, then, absorbs int o itself the universal consciousness , because the Cosmic f orces, by their attraction, overcome the cohesion of the mundane forces. All these systems of organised reactions, which h eld together the atoms of the manifested universe, ar e therefore withdrawn from the plane of the manifested universe into the Cosmic state of existe nce, and the atoms, of which the manifested universe was composed, return to their primary condition of tangential move ment, unco-ordin ated by any superior force. This is the lesser chaos and is referred to expressi vely as “old n ight” or the “night o f the ages”. It will be seen then, that the goal o f evoluti on is the development of a consciousness which ca n unite with t he Logoidal consciousness , and pass from the phase of a reflected , or projected existe nce - a phenomenal existenc e - to that of a real, actual or noumenal existenc e in the Cosmic s tate. This can only be achieved whe n the entire manifested universe is"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"perfectly synthesised. This represents the pralaya or nigh t of Brahma. A lesser pralaya, o ccurs a t the completion of each phase of evoluti on during the time in which the Logos meditates upon the concepts presented to it as the fruits of that evolutio n, thereby modifying its own consciousness. The succeeding swarm of Divine Sparks receives th e impressio n of the modified Logoidal consciousness, as previously explained, and therefore starts u pon its evolution with an elaborate reactionary capacity already develope d. The matter of each plane, having been used to build forms of a certain type, retains the reaction capacity of that type after the forms have been disintegrated, and therefore assembles i nto smaller forms with a greater readiness each time it is called upon to repeat the process until finally it holds these forms of its own orga nised forces. Thus subsequ ent life-waves are compelled to use these forms and are conditioned thereby. This is re trogressive, because each life-wave, having performed epigenesis, is mo re highly elaborated than its predecessor, and therefore cannot enter the same mould witho ut deformity. This matter will be referred to again when c onsidering the problem of evil. It must then be realised t hat each unit of a life swarm has, inherent in its nature, the reaction-capacities o f a Cosmos in its simplicity, and of all preceding lif e swarms in t heir complexity. Therefore, though fundamentally it has a perfect simplicity of principle, it has an infinite complexity of reaction-capacity. The Cosmic principl es are known an d are constant. To these each human soul is ob edient as to the fundamental laws of its nature. But the reactions of epigenesis ca nnot be calculated in relation to individuals b ecause of their complexity, and the number of possible m odifying factors. They can only be calculated in relation to evolutio ns because the number gives the average. He nce it is t hat epigenesis introduces the element known as free-will; and free-will, in the interval between its development and its synthesis t o the Logos, gives rise to the positive evi l of the manifested universe. ______________________ The teaching of the last two lec tures was d evoted to a consideration of the extra-universal in fluences. We are now in a position to consider the intra-universal i nfluences. Let it be borne in mind that the extra-universal influences firstly are of two types:- (a) The Cosmic influences which act upon the Logos, and to which th e Logos re acts, thus undergoing th e changes. (b) These changes, b eing reflected upon the manifested universe as variations and phases of the Logoidal in fluences. The Logoidal i nfluences are not constant, though tru e to type. This is an important point in which e soteric theology differs from exoteric theology which conceives of a God as changeless , whereas e soteric theology conceives of God as Himself evolving, an d as subject to mutation, according t o law. Secondly, the Logoidal i nfluences change ow ing to modifications in the Logoidal nature produced by his re actions to the evol ution of the universe. Thus, we may say, that the Logoidal i nfluences playing upon the manifested universe va ry in these two wa ys , and these have to be reckoned with in all calculatio ns of the influences to which evolv ing humanity is"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"subject, and they can be calculated - in the Cosmic typ e - by means of the equinoxes a nd the comets: and the evoluti onary reaction type by calcul ating the curve an d studying the phases of the biological hist ory. We will now proc eed to deal with the conditions in the manifested universe su bject to which ma n carries on his evolution. It will have been perceived, from a study of the foregoing chapters, that all action and reaction which is regular, becomes cycl ic, according to the law of universal curvature; and that cyclic reac tion makes a `track in s pace’ and thus becomes stereotyped. So that the manifested universe is at any given time a set of molecules and atoms held together by a framework of tracks in space. In other words, t he organised m anifestation of the `One Existe nce’ are simply a set of stereotyped reactions of which the tracks in space form the abstract mould. (The idea of the abstract mould is an important one and should be borne in mind). These sets of stereotyped reactions are of many different types, and they can be distinguish ed according t o the mode of their orig in. Some were left behind by the Lords of Flame in the course o f their evoluti on; others by the Lords of Form and others by the Lords of Mind; and each of these sets of stereotyped reactions form the natural laws which go vern the manifestations of those particular kinds of forms and activities which we re built up in the course o f that evolutio n, and these form the distinctions between one kind and another. But as each evolution makes use of the creations of its predecessor, the reaction types o f that predecess or will be found inherent in the successors, though the analytical mi nd can dissect them not. They also, however, exist as independent sub-strat a, and it is the knowledge o f the method of manipulating t hese - the elemental essences of each kingd om - which is t he basis of practical m agic; an d remember that each type o f manifestation has its elemental essence. You will recall that each phase of the manifested universe was built up in turn, and that these phases form the fields of develo pment of subseque nt life-waves. It therefore follows that each life-wave, at each phase of its evolutio n will be conditioned by th e conditions of the plane upon which th at is undergone. Therefore an understanding o f the planes is essential to an understanding of the problems of evolutio n, and of Initiation, which is sim ply condensed evolutio n. The laws of the first, or physical, pla ne are being worked o ut by means of the five physical senses which relate to that plane, and are well known to you u nder the generic name of Natural Sci ence, though why man should consider one of the planes of his existe nce natural and the rest unnatural is a strange fruit of epigenesis. These conditions, so far as the inanimate world is concerned, have b een well and truly observed, and subject to these laws, life will proceed with its evolu tion upon the physical plane. But scientific thought has made a mistake in believing that these laws are all t here are and this mist ake has vitiated the last hundred years o f scienc e. The ancients were wiser but not so well informed. Certain schools o f religious p hilosophy, however, make the opposite mistake and believe that life can work out its evolution regardl ess of the laws of the physical plane. This also is a mistake. The forces of a plane are supreme upon their own pl ane."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Controllers o f the plane below and, when in contact with the plane above, are in their turn controlled. Foe example, the laws of logic are supreme in the realm of mind. The images o f mind control the forms of the emotions but the images of mind are themselves controlled by th e spiritual forces. Each plane is capable of independent function, or of function in circuit, b ut as soon as the planes are put in circuit it is necessary that the curre nt should be completed by uniting th e arc upon the 7th plane, otherwise the open arc will short to the Left-hand path. For example, should the trained mind learn to control the body of emotions, and the body of emotions learn to control the physical vehicle, you have an arc in function of which o ne half is conscious or negative, an d the other half sub-conscious or positive, a nd the sub-conscious alwa ys gives the stimulus. If that arc be not completed into a circuit by junction through the Logoidal image on the 7th plane it will short from conscious to sub-consci ous upon the 4th or 5th accordi ng to type; and the sub-conscious b eing the positive or stimulator will assume the control. Now the sub-conscious was built up in the past, therefore the past will assume control. The past lies t o the left. That man will then return to an earlier phase of evolution and will be actuated by its m otives wh ile retaining the faculties o f a later form of evolution. Though these motives are adequate to the control of the simple faculties of that phase they are inadequate to the control o f the complex faculties o f a later phase, and that man becomes a danger t o evolu tion by d estroyin g the poise of the group soul of which he is a member and, as it will be remembered, it is the function of the Entities evolved in earlier life-waves to adjust the balance of compensating forces of the universe, h e will be dealt with by the Destroyers and will be reduced to his lowest co mmon denominator. That is to say, his later faculties wi ll be taken from him and he will be left only with those faculties suited to his impulses. C ertain types of mischievous malicio us idiots are produced in this way Chapter XXII. Influences of the Manifested Universe. Plane conditions, and Planetary Spirits. The doctrine of the planes cannot be understood without the doctrine of the Planetary Spirits. Let it be remembered that a Planetary Spirit was evolved with the development of each plane, but that as the Planetary Spirit itself was develo ped at the time that the plane was being evolved, its highest a spect will be of the subtlest aspect of the matter of that plane. Thus the subtlest aspect of the Earth is etheric. It is a plane of forms without intelligence. Each Planetary Spirit th en is the Archetype of the life of its plane, and it is the grea t dominating in fluence of that plane. In the course of the evolutio nary tides, however, matter of the planes below is gathered about that Planetary Spirit thus forming sh ells or bodies for it. But the matter of the planes above is n ot accreted. For these elements in its nature it depends upon the influences from superior planes which ac t upon its atmosphere, and that element in its atmosphere is m ore directly supplied by the corresp onding aspects in the lives inhabiting its sphere. Thus the Planetary Spirit is as a group soul of that"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"plane on which it functions through t he planes below it to the dense physical with which it has been supplied, but the elements of the plane above it, which serve it as an individuality, are supplied by the lives evolving in its sphere, and partakes of the nature of a Group Mind of the life of that planet. This is a subtle but important distinction, for it means that the Higher Self of the Planetary Spirit depends upon the lives dwellin g on it for its development. A Planetary Spirit is a vast ar tificial elemental for which hu manity builds a greater self, and while the Planetary Spirit determines the condition of all evolutio n and all function within its s phere, the higher as pects do not belong to it but are related to those Planetary Spirits who ar e its seniors. Therefore it is that, in relation to the Earth, the man who would a ttain the maximum evolutio n within her sphere - who would a chieve t he supreme humanity of the animal aspect - must make himself at-one with the forces of the Earth and of her subtle self - the Moon. But it only by the influences of the planets that he can raise c onsciousness to the higher planes, and upon the tides of the planets he must make the transition. He who takes the Earth as his planet becomes Earthbound and the time is s oon now, as Cos mic tim e is reck oned, that the present human evolution will be withdrawn from the Earth plane, and therefore the advance d souls of that evolu tion do not find their develo pment in communion with t he Earth Soul. It is to the children of the elements that Earth is an Initiator, not to the children of men. The Earth and the Moon Initiations are physical Initiations and concern the fall into matter and generation. The planets may be assigned as follows:- The Earth to the plane of the dense physical. The Moon her satellite, to that divis ion of it known as the etheric. Mars dominates the plane of the instincts a nd passions. Venus is the plane of the abstract e motions. Saturn is th e plane of the concrete mind. Saturn, be it noted, is the formative influence. Mercury is the planet of the abstract m ind. Jupiter the planet of the concrete spiritual. The Sun himself is the symb ol of the Logos on the 7th plane. Conceive then each planet as the archetype o f its plane. As radiating out its influence upon that plane and tuning that plane with its vibrations. And conceive each evolution as developing th e correspo nding factors within its n ature when sojourning o n a plane of the outgoing arc, and upon the returning arc a spiring to dominate those factors within itsel f and thereby to dominate the condition of the plane by means of the rapport thus developed with its ruling in fluence. The domination can only be completely achieved by securing the sympathetic co-o peration of the Planetary Spirit. Now as has been aforesaid, the Planetary Spirits ar e great but mindless Entities, therefore each has assigne d to it a Guide, and these Guides are of the first evolutio n - being Lords of Flame - and they are called the Archangels o f the spheres. It is through the knowledge o f these the dominion of the planes is secured. For t hat reason their Na mes are guarded, and known in their entirety to the Logos al one. For by th e Name in its entirety it is possible t o command, but in the Name in its consonants only it is possible to invoke."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"These Archangels o f the spheres have their own Initiates who know the consonants of the Names, and these are concerned with the evoluti on and regeneration of the planets to which they are assigne d, as the Masters, who m you kn ow, are concerned with the Earth plane. Influence of the Star Log oi. The Star Logoi have n othing to do with the Planetary Spirits, w ith who m they are sometimes confused, but with the signs o f the Zodiac, for they represent the influences of the Cosmos upon the solar syste m. They, likewise ar e built up as artificial elementals to whom are assigned Archangelic Gui des. But the Rays, be ing older than the planes are more highly evolved, a nd instead of being overshadowed a s in the case of Planetary Spirits, i dentification is complete. The Star Logoi ar e Lords of Mind. The elemental aspect of each Star Log os is built up by the evolution which takes plac e under its influence and a Star Logos migh t be termed the Group Mind of the evolu tion. Each evolutio n builds a Star Logos and thereby, as it were, focuses, stereotypes and tames that particular aspect of the Cosmic in fluences through which it evolves. These Logoi re main in function after the Cosmic Tide, which calle d them into being, has passed away, and thereby the Cosmic influences of that type are maintained in function in the universe, which evolutio n is develo ping into the form of a miniature Cos mos. Influences of other forms of Life. Finally there remains to be considered the influences of other forms of life - evolutio ns of a later and earlier day in p rocess of development. In the normal way these do not influence each other at all, but being of different states of conscious ness, though perchance occupying the same globe, have no point of contact. But under certain conditions contacts may be establishe d, and these contacts are popularly known as psychism. Psychism is of two types (a) the perception of that which is be low in point of evolutio n, and (b) the perception of that which is above; and the Earth, being at the nadir, these two wa ys of seeing may be conceived of as looking back along the left-hand path, or forward alo ng the right-hand path. It is permissible t o look forward a s far as the eye c an range because that will lead the soul forward, b ut to look backward leads the soul backward, f or where t he eye l ooks the feet will turn. We may never look backward up the planes - we ca n only look across the planes from the involuti onary to the evolutionary arc. Thus it is that those Entities which dwell upon, or can raise t heir conscious ness to, shall we say , the 3rd plane, may minister unto those in their sphere who are upon that plane on the outgoing arc, but those upon the physical pl ane may not look at the involutionary aspect of a subtler plane until they have m astered its evolutio nary aspect. The Initiators of the physical pla ne are those who h ave attained perfection on the 7th plane. Initiators alwa ys function across the diameter (upon a diagram you w ill see the significance of this) and the 7th initiates the 1st. Therefore man upon Earth is bidden to worship - no t the Nature forces of the 2nd plane, nor the saints of the 3rd, nor the Masters o f the 4th, nor the Angels o f the 5th, nor the Archangels of the 6th, nor the Christs o f the 7th, but the Logos Himsel f, whose Div ine"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Spark it is by which th ey live. But all through the intermediation of these Hierarchies they rise to the conscious ness of the Cosmos, but they never pause or achieve f inality upon any pl ane of the manifested universe, for there is no finality in manifestation. The 1st plane is the only plane upon which the Initiation of the Logos is gi ven, but it is this Initiation of the Logos which m arks the transmission f rom the involutio nary to the evolution ary arc, for it wakens the Divine Spark which h as well and truly been called the `God within’ and which evol ves into union with the `God without’. On the evol utionary arc, as he goes up the planes, man no longer looks s traight to the Logos but to his immediate Hierarchical s uperiors; but on the involutionary arc he neither looks back to the Logos, nor on towards matter, but across t he diameter of the plane to his gods, who ar e the evolved E ntities who are withdrawing from materialisati on, and in their withdrawal have reac hed the plane to which he has advanced. Therefore it is that the primitive relig ions are along polytheistic lines. Monotheism m arks the nadir of materiality and the transition from the involutio nary to the evolu tionary arc. The Jews, who f irst achieved this, are the most materialistic of all peoples. On the evol utionary arc the religions ar e not polytheistic for, having passed through the nadir, entities of this evolutio n have known t he One God. They are, instead, obedient to the Hierarchies ; for that Light which, when dimmed by the veil of matter, is bearable, would be unbearable, when matter no longer shelters. Therefore upon the subtler planes when consciousness is freed from the brain we never ap proach the Creator direct but always through those Intermediaries who transmit and translate the force from plane to plane, of whom the Group Mind, or Star Logos of our evolutio n is the ultimate. This teaching, you wi ll perceive embraces the symbolism of the Caduceus. You see the direct p ath from the base to the Crown; an d you s ee that the paths wind fr om side to side of each plane as the downflowing tide of life is made conscious of the higher as pect dwelling upon its plane, and the upgoing ti de has to made aware o f, and minister to the downflowing. The Cosmic Christ, or S tar Logos, presiding over each evolution is a Lord of Mind, but as he is of the 3rd evolutio n he will have the aspects of the earlier evolutio n in his nature. Therefore while 3 is the prime symbol of this evolutio n, because its Christ is three-aspected, 4 is the ultimate symb ol. The Trinitarian aspect is the basis, but the Tetragram matonic is t he completion. This is the clue to much. Remember never se ek to explain anything in m anifestation or out of it in terms of the static, for all is kine tic. Chapter XXIII. Teaching concerning other evolutio ns inhabiting a Planet simultaneously. In considering the subject of simultaneous inhabitation of a planet by different evolu tions it is necessary to realise that these fall into different classes:- (a) Those of the outgoing or involution ary arc. (b) Those of the more highly evolved evolutio nary arc. There may also be a third type o f classification in which th e types of life differ in kind instead of in degrees o f development."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"We will proceed to enumerate and describe the different types of life which may be distinguished upon a given planet.

The elements of inanimate nature are their children ; created by the conceptual action of their intellects in the same way that the Logoidal Min d projects the manifested universe. A Lord of Flame conceives a function, and having him self evolved b eyond the point at which he can develop further by this functioning, withdraw s to a higher pl ane, and projects the concepts of that functioning to maintain the function. These thought-f orms, by experie nce, develop a personality, but have not yet arri ved at an Individuality , therefore they are spoken of as soulless. You will observe th at the Divine Sparks d evelop, first a nascent Individuality and then a personality, but the creations of the created develop, first a personality and then aspire t o Individuality. Therefore they are spoken of as evil spirits - familiars, d emons and genii. They are not deliberately malevolen t, but are incapable of response to aught but the lower aspects, when approached upon their own plane. Their sole link with the Divine is through the consciousness of their creator. Therefore it is that those who would deal with them need to come with the authority of their respective originat ors of the different types o f Elemental Beings, then they become the Messengers o f God, for they are approached from their Div ine aspect, and the reflected Divinity within them responds; otherwise they are approached from the demoniacal a spect and in their lower aspect they respond. These, the servants of the Gods, maintain the co- ordinated rhythms of inanimate nature. They are the controlling forces of heat and light, o f gravity and all dyna mic reaction. The Lords of this evolutio n rule upon the 7th and 6th planes as Regents o f the Elements, or Lords of the Elements, as they are sometimes calle d, and, according to the operations of their nature, are the kinetic conditions of the manifested universe; and subject to this, man must perform the actions of his evolutio n. To these Lords man must give unquestioning obedience,"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"reverenc e to their greatness, and the gratitu de which is du e to those who, by ta king thought, sustain the conditions o f his being. To their servants or t hought-forms, the Elementals, he owes the gratitude due to those who, by th eir nature, serve, bu t who serve unintelligently. Should he seek to approach them he does so through the corres ponding aspects of his own etheric double, but does so at his peril, for though they will first vivify those aspects, they will subseque ntly absorb them. Now be it known that these Elementals ar e evolving upwards grade by grade through the personality towards Individuality, and in the event of his making co ntact with them, some among them might fall to the temptation of Black Magic whereby evolutio n is illegitimately hastened, and seek to appropriate an already develope d Individuality and thereby establish th eir contact with the Divine. In such an occurrenc e the opposite to the ordinary form of obsession occurs - th e personality is thrust out and an Elemental conscious ness takes its plac e; and of such an one it may be said the they have the stone of the Earth, or a wave of the sea, or the wind of heaven, or a flame of fire for a heart, for human heart they have not; and because of the strength o f the Elements they call into the elemental in mankind with a profound calling, an d such have alwa ys troubled the sons and daughters of men. For they come as beings of a strange and elemental power th at know not the bonds that bind humanity, and they may be known by th ese things - they ever seek their own kingdom and sorrow for it; for humanity for them is a crucifixion; and they ever call t o the same aspects of men and women, and those who answer they destroy, for they are too strong for them. It may als o happen that one who ha s made contact with the Elementals, instead of being ob sessed, may be mated. Then will the elemental aspect of their nature be linked to an Elemental and yearn t owards th at unseen lover who is n ot of human kind. Then there is s orrow for that one, for they thirst with a t hirst which ca nnot be slaked within t he flesh. To meet their lover they must issue forth in the etheric form. Much might be said of this, but not now. Should a human being, however, seek contact with the Lords of the Elementals he purifies those aspects of his nature which corres pond to their kingdom until they become the refined essence of their qualities. I n the stability of the Earth he is stable. In the mobility of the water he is mobile. In the speed of the wind h e is swift and aspiring. In the brightness of the flame he is zealo us. Then, being Lord of these things within hi mself, he is a Lord of the Elements in the microc osm, and may thereby claim kinship with the Lords of the Elements of the macrocosm, and the Messe ngers of the Elements are his servants. There is no other way than this. Those who us e the Names without the power invoke to their own destructio n. The Lords of Form are they who govern all p hysical a nd chemical a ffinities, a nd to them applies all t hat has been said of the previous evolutio n. By th eir aid we m ay penetrate into the knowledge o f the relationship of things - for `form’ is but a co-ordi nated relationship. The interaction between the Lords of Flame and the Lords of Form is ver y important, for the Lords of Flame are the Givers of Life and the Lords of Form are the merciful Givers of Death. It is from the Lords of Form that we learn the Laws o f Death -"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"the laws of escape and freedom. To master the forces of the Lords of Flame we invoke t he powers of the Lords of Form. To master the powers o f the Lords of Form we invoke the powers of the Lords of Mind. The Lords of Form are the Laws of Friction . They enable force to function by co nfining it, but by friction they disperse it. Therefore are the Lords of Form the Lords of Death, for they bring all things liv ing to an end, and all things kinetic to a standstill; but they make actual that which is p otential. They are the Educators. Discipline is t heirs, though punishment rests with the Lords of Mind. The Elementals of the Lords of Form determine the nature of all chemical el ements, combinations and reactions. The Lords of Flame are the laws of physics. The Lords of Form are the laws of chemistry. The Lords of Mind are the laws of biology. The Lords of Humanity will be the laws of Sociology . In considering the question of other evoluti ons occupying the same planet it must not be forgotten that if consciousness be raised above the physical pl ane to function in another state it is thereby lifted from the sphere of the Earth and comes under the Rege ncy of the Planetary Spirit corresponding to the plane on which it functions. (This is a matter to be remembered in casting the horoscope of psychics.) In this teaching, h owever, we will only deal with those influences operating on the Earth sphere. These include those influences operating on the etheric sub-planes while ap proaching the Earth on the involuti onary arc, and those which also influence the Earth on the evolu tionary arc. In the ordinary way, for the creatures of an evoluti on to look back to the conditions o f a phase which they have outgrown is re trogression, and to be deprecated. Those who h ave immediately passed beyond the Earth’s sphere are not permitted to look back lest they become earthbound. Hence the evil of interference with the spirits of the recently departed, save f or the purpose of giving quittanc e. There exists, h owever, a peculiar modification of evolution whos e effects are known to you under the general t erm of the work of the Great White Lodge. In the ordinary course of evolution the wood grow s with the growth o f the trees. That is to say, that the perfecting of the individual souls perfects the group life. But with th e coming in o f self-consciousness comes a modification of group life, and certain souls c hoose the path of the Redeemer rat her than the path of redemption. They elect to forego the fruits of their efforts and their good karma is added to the racial karma for its modification. Chapter XXIV. Influences which Humanity exerts upon Itself. It is not proposed in this teaching t o recapitulate known facts in evolu tion, but rather to supplement that knowledge by the revelation of unknown factors, and the explanation of the implicati ons of little known or m isunderstood factors. In previous lectures we have dealt with pre-h uman evolutions and their influence upon humanity. In the present lecture we w ill deal with certain littl e known influences which"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"humanity exerts up on itself. Do not let it be forgotten that all evol ution has a sequenc e in time - or technically, a sequence in cause and effect; and though the path of evolution be so broad that many are contemporaries, yet t he evolution ary types h ave a well marked sequence. The average o f the present humanity may be looked upon as being two- thirds of the way round the cycle; and it should also be remembered, with regard t o the individual, that just as all the latencies o f the past are innate in him, so are all the potentialities o f the future, and that some of these potentialities are on the threshold of actuality. The full range o f the possibilities o f human evolutio n thus falls into three sections: the latencies, t he actualities, the potentialities. The doctrine of the Group Soul is closely interwoven with that of the Planetary Spirit for, as has been shown, the Planetary Spirit is the Personality of the planet built up out of its exp eriences derived f rom the consciousnesses functioning within its s phere. No consideration of group or individual p sychology can be adequate unless allowance be made for the influence of the Planetary Spirit. This is sometimes referred to as the Earth pull, and as it was b uilt up in the past and contains nothing of the future, it is necessarily purely atavistic an d therefore, relatively speaking evil. In contra-disti nction to the Planetary Spirit it m ust not be forgotten that there is the Planetary Entity. This is the Logoidal realisati on of the existence of a planetary sphere, and the Logoidal c oncept of its mission and evolu tion. This corresponds to the individuality, and development of both aspects takes place till they meet. With regard to a Planetary Spirit, howeve r, it is built up out of the realisa tions of the conscious life of its sphere, and as it is not possible t o realise a thing until after its occurrenc e, the Planetary Spirit is al ways a stage behind humanity in its evolu tion. It will be seen that each phase of experience of a developing hu manity lays down a corresponding level of Planetary consciousness . This is a reflection, or projection,of evolutionary consciousness, and like all re flections , is reversed , so the lowest aspect appears on the surface and the highest is c oncealed in the depths. This is bor ne out by experience , for when we touch the Earth Soul we touch its most primitive aspects first, and it is not until we have p enetrated deeply into its sphere that we realise what it is capable of. It is very necessary, in approaching t hese matters, that we should not investi gate them until full self-consciousness has been attained. If we approach them by means of sub- consciousness we make ourselves one with them and the lesser is under the dominion of the greater - the individual of the mass. The Planetary Spirit may be conceived o f as the mass karma of the Earth, and all life on the Earth must be lived in relation to that karma, for it makes the mental atmosphere in which we live and move and have our being. In considering the horoscope insufficient attention is usually given to the phases of the physical pl ane - to the changing tides of the Earth and of the Moon. It is not enough to note the Moon’s position. It should be observed whet her she is in her negative or p ositive phase. Likewise with the Earth, the season of the Elements should be observed. All these play an important part in human affairs, for, though they are not"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"determining, t hey are conditioning. The past or biological consciousness then, lives in t he Earth karma and also lives in each individual identity, and the reaction between the individual and collective atavistic strat a are very important. Wherever the development of a particular aspect has had its seat or form, that aspect will dominate the atmosphere of the locality. Where the Druidical c ults built up their powers t hese powers w ill remain in evide nce and will stimulate that aspect of an individual which th ey were de signed to bring int o function, and while this method of bathing in the mental atmosphere is valuable for adjusting t he balance of the individual who is lacking in this respect, it is injudicio us for those who alre ady have an overplus o f it, and as these feel themselves to be alien in the modern civilisation they are irresistibl y attracted towards the ancient cultures an d an overset ting of balance may be the consequ ence. Each race maintains its cultural tra ditions, and each cult surv ives until the faculties which it was de signed to initiate have become the normal inheritance of the species. Then it ceases to become esoteric an d becomes exot eric. Cults do not die because they are cut off from the march of progress, but because their spiritu al principle is absorbed completely in the life of the race. That which they set out to teach is taken for grant ed and their day an d teaching is over, because the pupil knows the lesson. That which is sloughe d off is but the effete accre tions of human opinion seeking to explain that which transcends it. But as long as there are souls that require t he discipline, the cult lives on. The cults of the past gain their power by contacting th e strata of the Earth Soul to which th eir Initiation belongs. Now be it known that these strata have cl ose connection with the elementals, being used by th em for the building of the thought-forms which enable them to assume a species o f incarnation. Therefore the contacts of an atavistic cult m ay be far reaching. These things h ave their place in the armoury of spiritual weapo ns, but are to be approached with caution for they are two e dged. A knowledge of them is necessary in the study of psychical p athology, but not for self-development. These faculties ar e normal in us, and receive an undue stimulus if unduly fostered. To each man his own M aster. Do not select a Master of a lower or a different type of evolutio n to your own. Chapter XXV. The Law of Action and Reaction. Action and reaction are equal and opposite. The equivalenc e of the re-ac tion renders it calculable if the ratio of transmissio n be known.

Transmissio n takes place by Sub-planes. The potency of each sub-plane is the square of the potency of the sub-plane below it. This, you w ill see, is explained by the fact that two o pposing and equally balanced forces set up a vortex which is th e primal atom. When these two forces meet they neutralise e ach other and the result is a centre of stability which is d evoid o f force save in its subjective as pect. It may be noted that a static force is the subjective as pect of a force. If, therefore, you should be able to separate the gyrating curren ts which form a primal atom you wi ll have two sets of potencies e ach of which would be the equivalent of the latency of that atom. So that instead of one actual latency you have two potencies. S o that the atom has been multiplied by itself and transferred from one plane of manifestation to another. Whenever a thing is t hus multiplied it is tr anslated from one plane to another and into another dimension. When, therefore, action and reaction are said to be equal a nd opposite it must be remembered that they are so in the ordinary sense in which this term is em ployed o n the plane under consideration only. If, however, such conditions should occur that the force should be transmitted from a lower to a higher pla ne then the reaction is in t he equivalent potency of that plane, which is the square of the squared sub-plane of the plane from which the atom came. Hence it is that when you sublimate a force you multiply it by itself. When you de-grade a force, you divide it by itself. The term de-grad ation is here employed in its technical se nse as the opposite of sublimation, meaning de scent into matter. On the involutionary arc de-grad ation was the means of development. Hence it is that in the course o f Initiatory experiences in which the soul recapitulated evolutio n, it has to know the depths. Each atom of matter contains the fruits of an evoluti on. Involution is a decimal process. Therefore you wi ll see that if you could disintegrate the atoms of matter in an ounce of clay you could shatter the globe on which you st and, but before you could perform that magical pr ocess you would have, by the power of your w ill, to dissolve the cohesion of the Cosmos. Therefore"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"it is not to be anticipated that this experim ent will be success fully executed in the immediate future. Each Divine Spark by th e time it has reached the nadir of involutio n and is ready to embark upon the path of evolution whereo n it is s een to be characteristically human, possesses potentialities which you little realise . When subjective consciousness is raised from the plane of its habitual functioning to the next superior pl ane it conforms to the law alrea dy enumerated and an inertia is converted into two kineticisms . It is seldom that the consciousness centres of the lower pla ne are able to carry this force if the conversion is sudden and total. Hence the saying ”Thou canst not look upon My face and live”. Hence also the fact that where a lesser a nd more partial form of conversion takes place it is a pprehended simply as a blinding fl ash of light. W hen such conversion t akes place in its normal form it is performed by the method of addition instead of multiplica tion. That is to say, when the transmutation is per formed from one plane to another by the process of squaring, the result may be describe d in the words of scripture ”He walked with G od and was no t”. When the process takes the form of a many tim es repeated multiplica tion, you have the ordinary course of the Path, each grade of Initiation being a multiplicatio n. When you have the process a s an addition you h ave the normal course of evolutio n. Each grade of Initiation is perceived by the super- consciousness as a blinding flash of light, and by me ans of this flash the image o f the sub-plane to which it belongs is photograph ed on the sub-consciousness whenc e conscious ness re ads it at its leisure. So that if power be raised a plane polarity is insufficient and you must have a group. The form for a force raised from one plane to another is built up of the grou p mind. If a force is raise d a second plane, you m ust have a second grade in your group, you therefore get a grade for each planer. If, on the other hand, force be degrade d a plane, or a sub-plane, an entirely different process occurs, the force being rendered inert, the vehicle through which it functions is an empty channel, standing op en, anythi ng may fill it. This is the key to much, it explains obsession. Now remember that the term obsessio n is popularly used inaccurately when what is technically called “oversha dowing” is meant. Overshad owing is a controlling in fluence exercised by one entity over an other. Obsession only takes place when the soul has been precipitat ed by the process of the degra dation of consciousness . The term preci pitation is used because the analogy is exac t. When therefore a true case of obsession has to be dealt with, it is n ot only necessary to cast out the invading entity but to sublimate the soul. You will see a reference to this in the story of the man from whom the devils were cast out and into whom the seven devils entered finding the house empty. The degrada tion of the soul takes plac e through t he operation of lower types o f evolution with which contacts have been formed, it does not take place as a result of a deliberate act of will, but rather as a result of an inhibition of will. Therefore when you are dealing with a case in which the will functions from the inhibiting aspect rather than the kinetic"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"aspect, you m ust always take care lest such a pull downwards is set up. Inhibited will is a more dangero us thing than the perverted will, because it exp oses its possessor t o the influence of extra-hu man forces. You will see then that the occult signific ance of the maxim th at the law of Action and Reaction being equ al has two implicatio ns - action and reaction are only equal on one plane - but when the functioning o f seven planes is availabl e they are anything but equal. Action and reaction are equal a nd opposite on the plane on which t hey occur, but when an action, occurring on a plane, has its reaction on another plane the result is a transmutation of values. These values have already been explain ed to you. I t will no doubt have o ccurred to you that when a force, being transmuted from one plane to another, exerts its influence on a second plane and withdraws its influence from the first, an alteration of equilibrium will result. This is in deed the case, and it is therefore necessary for the Adept who p erforms this operation to maintain the adequate equilibr ium of stresses. For this purpose he must know the method of properly de-grading an equivalen t force. This is a n exceedingly important point in practical o ccultism , and concerns the utilisation of reverse aspects in their compensating po tencies. The Sephiroth, being reversed, are the Qliphoth. Therein is t he key to much, and therefore it is that in every magical op eration in which grea t spiritual p otencies are invoked, lesser entities ar e also employed i n their proper aspects and when what you would t erm a Master wishes to operate on the physical plane, he will of necessity employ an entity of a lower grade of evolutio n than his own, a nd he will be compelled to work through the personality of that person in order to restore the equilibrium which he is about to displace. He will then, metaphoricall y speaking, em ploy that entity as the nadir of his arc. The force he transmutes will be received by the highes t aspect of that entity and will be expresse d by the lowest an d most concrete aspect of the Individuality of that entity, and the personality will be used for the return flow from the physical plane. This would be expresse d in diagrammatic form by the letter Y of which t he two ar ms should repres ent the individuality and the personality, and the basal point the channel of outflowing and inflowing on the physical plane. Upon the Y superimpose an X and you will get the symbol of the outflowing and inflowing forces, the X being formed of two “C ’s” back to back, the left hand being marked with an arrow of outflowing, and the right hand with an arrow of inflowing. You will now perceive why chastity is demanded when o perations of practical m agic are in progress, b ecause the return flow, having to take place through the personality in its lowest and most primitive aspect that aspect has to be upturned so that the force of its expressi on may return to God who ga ve it. This is but another way of expressing the use of sublimation for the purpose of generating force in the upper planes. The pupil who receives f orce from his Master o n a higher plane for purposes of transmission to the physical pla ne must be prepared to effect the transmutation of the corresponding am ount of force in his own n ature from a lower plane to a higher in or der to preserve the necessary balance. It is the neglect o f this operation which ca uses the all too"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"frequent overweighting of the lower aspects of the Occultist. Chapter XXVI. The Law of Limitation. Limitation is t he first law of manifestation, therefore it is the first law of power. This is n ot sufficiently appreciated. Many people believe that a spiritual power is infinite, which is far from being the case. For the Logos to manifest It has to circumscribe its elf. But a spiritual power is so much greater than the potencies o f the lower planes that, when brought to bear upon them, it overco mes all resistances. But in order to bring any energy into manifestation it is necessary to provide it with a form or vehicle. The form is built in the substance of the plane immediately superior to that upon which it is d esired t o produce an effect, and through this channel is dir ected the force it is d esired to invoke. To invoke a force withou t directi ng it is to disperse it. It is only by a knowledge and utilisation of the Law o f Limitation that power ca n be conserved. I n order to achieve an end you must outline that end and limit yoursel f to it, rejecti ng all that is irrelevan t; and note this point, the first process i n the invocation of power is the rejection of that which is irrelevant. This is another name for concentration. The Law of Limitation means the concentration of power by the rejecti on of the irrelevant . This is n ot sufficiently understood. In all undertakings t he prime requisite for success is t o know what you cannot do. This is discrimin ation. The Law of Limitation is t he necessary corollary of the laws governing th e invocati on of power. When it is desired to put through an enterprise , first proceed to think the matter out in all its d etails, clearly outlining the end it is designed to achieve. Next co nsider t he means whereby that end may be achieved. Next proceed to eliminate all desire f or anything unconnected with that aim. This is a most important point. In other words you re nder yourself one-pointed. It may well be that in so doing you put aide certain legitimate human aims. Put them aside with the proviso that in due season their claims shall be considere d, and then proceed with utter ruthlessness to limit yoursel f to the matter in hand so that you have but one desire and all else is s ubordinate to it; and think of nothing else; read of nothing els e; dream of nothing else until the matter is finished. Then having achieved t his complete circumscriptio n of desire and limitation of the content of conscious ness, invoke the power for its performance and in a flash the thing will be done. Thorough preparation means quick completion. In these matters insufficient time is usually given to the preparation, and therefore the achievement is inc omplete. If it is your int ention to invoke spiritual p otencies you must prepare for them by the complete dedication of the content of consciousness. It must not be forgotten, howeve r, that such a narrowing of consciousness would destroy the balance of the nature if persisted in unduly. Therefore learn to alternate periods of concentration with peri ods of expansion in fullness o f life, so that the broadened consciousness and developed character act as a background for the intensification and limitation of desire which brings spiritu al potencies into manifestation on the physical plane. It is the lack of this proportion which le ads to fanaticism a nd lack of balance. It is by the limita tion of the content of consciousness that you ac hieve the concentration of power. But it is by th e"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"development and expansi on of consciousness that you a chieve t he basis of limitation, because limitation implies discrimina tion, and a limitation of conscious ness is e ntirely different to a limited consciousness. Limited conscious ness implies t he exclusio n of experienc e. Limitation of consciousness implies selection of experienc e and the focussing o f attention upon the chosen subject. It is the Law o f Limitation which is im plied in the power to focus. It is by availing ours elves of resistances that we are able to obtain a purchase upon diffused manifestation. The great er part of the resista nce experienc ed by th e neophyte in his attempt to practice the occult ar ts is the resistance of inertia. In order to set in motion that which is inert it is n ecessary for the Ego to obtain a purchase upon a similar resistance. Inertia is then balanced agains t inertia , and the kineticism o f the Ego avails to turn the balance. In this way results m ay be achieved that the unaided will, could not obtain. It is necessary that in the service of the Masters you should acquire a knowledge o f the magical arts , because these enable you t o invoke and concentrate power effectively. It is the use of these arts for evil ends which is f orbidden, but the use of them under the law is an economy of energy. Remember then that in all undertakings limitation is the secret of power. This does not imply, however, that you s hould always seek to achieve small things. Always correlate your effort with the Cosmos itsel f, and see your work in relatio n to the whole, but rigidly circumscribe t he section of that Cosmic whole which you t ake into your hands. To weigh yoursel f in the scale agains t that which is great er than yourself is to be outweighed by th e inertia of the mass, but to circumscribe a section of the mass and separate it from the whole, is t o enable yoursel f to achieve pi ecemeal that which you ca nnot achieve in bulk. In making this circumscriptio n look for the natural lines of cleavage, s eek the joints o f the problem. In all affairs there wi ll always be points where m atters can be segregated, and other points that will resist p artition. Look for these on the Astral plane among the emotions invol ved in the matter. The scheme as a whole m ay be envisaged a s One on the Mental plane, but upon the Astral plane the lines of cleavage may be seen. The object of immediate desire m ay be distinguishe d from the object of remote desire. The object which is de sired by on e aspect of a complex na ture may be distinguishe d from the object which is desired by another aspect. If you yourself circumscribe c onsciousness to a single point it will be brought to such a fine edge that it can be inserted along the lines o f cleavage of an uncircumscribed enterprise an d deal with that enterprise p iecemeal. It is the focus of consciousness which en ables power to be brought to bear, and work to be accomplished with that power, but it is the extension of consciousness that provides the necessary base upon which th at force obtains a purchase. The concentration at the apex must be supplemented by breadth at the base. This is a point which is o ften forgotten. The Law of Limitation is t he basis of practical application. It is the secret of power, therefore it is withheld from those on the probationary Path. They are taught of the existe nce of an infinite reservoi r of power, and to meditate thereon. They are taught to meditate upon the formless"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"power. This enables the power to use them, not they the power . But when the knowledge is acquired o f the method of channel-buildi ng through the lower planes, it is p ossible to direct power t o any gi ven end. When this is acc omplished power is translated from the planes of the individuality to the planes of the personality; not within the organis m, but witho ut. It is therefore necessary to have the knowledge o f the method of making forms “As a bove, so below”. When the Unmanifest willed to become manifest, motion flowed in a circle returning whenc e it originat ed. To make a form upon the concrete mental plane thought must move in a circle, re turning whenc e it originat ed. Starting with a c oncept it must proceed logicall y from that concept, reasoning fr om the general to the particular u pon the outgoing arc, and from the particular t o the general on the arc of returning, th us envisaging both sides of the question and correlating them. This is the first stage. The concept thus formed should then be transferred to the realm of feeling. This corresp onds to the second Ring to be formed. The concept should then be subjected to the driving force of the nature. This corresp onds to the Third ring. Now the Ring Cosmos is th e concept on the mental plane, the Ring Chaos is t he driving force of the instincts, and the Ring-Pass-Not c orrespo nds to the Upper Astral aspect. By meditating o n these corres pondences you wi ll learn much. This is your arch etypal f orm and within it will be built up all the actions and reactions arising in relation to the matter in hand, but this matter must always first be circumscribe d by the clear definition of consciousness . The secondary action of consciousness arises with regard t o the desires rela ting thereto, and the third aspect concerns t he use of the primitive forces for the generation of power. The use of the primitive force for the generation of power w ill be dealt with in a future lecture. The Cosmic aspect of the concept having thus been set up, manifestation in the world of form takes place within the circumscribed sphere. Without this circu mscriptio n there is n o manifestation. The prime law of the involutio nary arc is t he Law of Limitation. The prime law of the evolutio nary arc is t he Law of the Seven De aths. The Law of Limitation has for its basis the Law of Action and Reaction. The Law of Action and Reaction has for its basis the phenomena connected with th e curve. The curve sufficiently prolonged becomes a circle. A segment of a curve is an arc. The pendulum swings in a n arc. The pendulum is the type of action and reaction, equal and opposite. Prolong the arc describe d by the pendulum and you will form a circle, o f which the length o f the pendulum is the radius. This expl ains much in relation to the transmutation of forces from plane to plane. Incarnation is based upon the Law of Limitation. Karma or destiny, on the Law of Action and Reaction, and because it is only in a limited sphere that equal and opposite action and reaction, can take place, force has to be manifested in form, so that the fruits of its action may be returned again to the sphere whence it originated. The building o f a vehicle f or incarnation follows the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"lines alrea dy laid down. Again we h ave the circumscribing which delimits t he destiny to be worked o ut in that incarnation. Each soul determines with what p abulum the personality shall supply it. The Oversoul is the Lord of Destiny to each one. It is this you invoke in all matters connected with your f ate. You invoke your own Higher Sel f. The Law of Limitation is a nalogous t o the mathematical concept concerning measurements of surfaces. It has a two- dimensional aspect. It is by the introduction of a third dimension that we tra nscend the Law of Limitation, and man having a consciousness of three dimensions, can use the Law of Limitation by tra nscending it. U pon whatever plane the Law of Limitation acts it can always be transcended by the addition of a dimension to consciousness . This is the secret of the control of the Law of Limitation. The Law of Limitation is the means of calculating t he conditions under which an operation has to be carried out. If you do but determine these conditions you ar e controlled by these conditions, but if you ca n raise consciousness to the plane which can perceive them as a synth esis, can perceive the abstraction which c omprises them and can then delimit that abstraction and consider it in relati onship to the condition of its plane apart from the Law of Limitation, can conceive it in relation to the Cosmos, it is then possible, having in conception linked that idea to the Cosmos by e nvisaging the relation between the whole and the part, it is then possible for consciousness , bearing this Cosmic id ea in mind, to be redirected to the finite aspect of that idea and then to approach it on another and superior dimension, and while utilising the Law of Limitation to circumscribe t he matter in hand, to transcend the limita tions its elf. This method can be applied, not only to the handling o f any ma tter or affair, but also to the building o f the bodies in an incarnation, and to the handling of karma during inc arnation, for do we but once see our predestined fate in its rel ationship to Cosmic law we have mastered our fate. The Higher Self always sees it thus, because the Higher Self has a Cosmic relationship by means of the Logoidal i mprints on the Divine Spark; the lower self, having a terrestial rela tionship sees all things in relation to birth and death, beginni ng and ending. So long as consciousness dwells in the senses it will view things f rom the standpoint of the senses, of pain and pleasure, beginning an d ending. But when rais ed to the elevation of Cosmic things, it wi ll see all things in relation to evoluti on, to the curve that comes round the whole circle, not to the straight lin e of the partition in finiteness. The personality is what it is by vi rtue of the Law of Limitation. The individuality is what it is by vi rtue of the Law of the Nature of the Cosmos; and the ladder from the personality to the individuality has seven ru ngs, and these rungs are the Seven D eaths, for it is the Law of Limitation that brings t o birth, but it is the Law o f Death that brings to life. For birth is d eath, and death is birt h. All things are born blind, which m ercifully prevents them from knowing that they are dead. You do not realise th at your pl ane is the plane of death, and that our plane is the plane of life. Those who are in matter are in the grave, they are dead and buried. Death and Initiation produce the same results, therefore it is that all Initiations contain the symb olism o f death and burial. Always remember that upon the material plane death and loss mean freedom and resurrectio n. Possessi ons are as the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"earth that is heaped upon the corpse. Learn therefore to look down upon your dead bodies and to galvanise t hem with your life, but do not make the mistake of living in them. It is very useful to be able to project consciousness on to the mundane sphere but it is ver y disadvan tageous to be fettered by the conditions of that sphere. You are held to that sphere by two things - fear and desire. Initiation will enable you to live upon this plane, though still attached to brain consciousness . It is therefore that the degrees t each, firstly the overco ming of the desire, secondly the overco ming of fear, and thirdly death and resurrection . By knowing the Law of Limitation and transcending it you can use it. Having circumscrib ed the task you have set yoursel f, see it in relation to the Cosmos. By seeing th e Cosmic Archetype you will draw in the force of that ideal and by seeing th e circumscribed form which it is desired to manifest, you will focus that force. With regard to the practical ap plication of this, when a problem presents itself for solution, gather toge ther in meditation. First o utline the problem in debate, then meditate upon its Cosmic a spect, and invoke the Cosmic force. Chapter XXVII. The Law of the Seven D eaths. The 1st Death. As has been previousl y recorded, when two lines of movement intersect a vortex is set up. These two lin es of movement then cease to exist and become a centre of stability. This is the first death. The 2nd Death. Learn now th e implicatio ns of death. Action and reaction are equal a nd opposite upon the plane of their inception. They act, react, and continue to manifest in cycl ic form. When transmuted from one plane to another they cease to manifest upon the first plane and come into being in a different form upon the next plane. If this translation be viewed fr om the plane of the inception of these forces it is c alled death. If it be viewed from the plane of the reception of these forces it is called birth. If an involutio nary change be viewed from the more primitive aspect it is lo oked upon as death. If it be viewed from the more evolved as pect it is look ed upon as birth. This is the second death. Let us make this clear by an example. Life, having evolved b eyond the capacity of lowly forms to give it expressio n, builds its elf higher f orms. The fossilized remains of the abandoned lower forms are found among the debris of life, they have undergone death. Their race is extinct. They are no more. But the life has achieved rebirth into a higher type o f vehicle. It is only by the abandonment of the simpler form that life could enter the more complex, though conscious ness that is in the plane of the simpler form sees herein a tragedy because it cannot conceive the higher li fe and it sees its own passing prefigured; but the consciousness which is o f the higher li fe sees the birth of a new ma nifestation and rejoices , for it sees the fuller expressio n of its potentialities . The 3rd Death. Each individualised consciousness lives to die and dies to live. It is only by de ath that we can reap the fruits of life. We graze in the fields of Earth, and we lie down in t he fields of Heaven to chew the cud. It has been said `for one"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"hour’s study do three hours meditation’.

All would be concrete, unrelated, unsynthesised, but in the meditation which is death the abstract e ssence of life is extracte d and instead of a million c oncrete images t here is the abstract concept.

Let the chasm between the so-calle d living and the so-called dead be bridged by this method that men may cease to fear death. The 4th Death. Four is alwa ys the linking number; the fourth body being the highest aspect of the personality links it with th e individuality, and the fourth death is calle d the linking d eath - the teaching de ath - or al ternatively may be known as sl eep. Sleep is a m iniature death, just as death is the major sleep, and a knowledge o f the nature of sleep assists t o explain death. The nature of sleep is insufficiently understood. The impressio ns of sleep received by t he waking consciousness are misleading. In sleep the physical pl ane is dissoci ated from the other planes, and the soul thus freed receives no longer the impressio ns coming through the five gates of sense and we say `it sleeps and is passive’ but the individuality works and is active. In waking life the Individuality sleeps and in sleeping life the Individuality wakes. The Individuality is referred to in the sacre d writings as the `Angel th at ever b eholds the face of God’. During th e waking life of the body the Individuality is intent upon translating int o its own t erms of abstraction the concrete impressions flowing into the lower soul. When it is no longer thus inturned, subjective, b ecause the lower soul is n ot pouring up on it impressio ns, it becomes objective upon its own plane and beholds the `face of the Father’. It then measures itself by the Divine standard and makes such adjustments as are within its p ower; but the adjustments of the spirit are aeonial and are measured by the span of Heaven. During slee p the lesser so ul may n ot, however, sink into oblivion, but being much concerned with the unsatisfied desires of the flesh it will continue to function in relation to the thought-forms begot of these desires. It dreams the dreams derived from unsatisfied passions and the urge of the instincts. The Individuality is not freed and instead of beholding th e `face of the Father which is in Heaven’ beholds the reversed image o f the human form and thereby develops i n its own likeness. The Individuality, being unable to function on its own plane, makes no growth a nd remains unevolved, a nd the personality becomes an exaggerated caricature o f itself. From this it can only be freed by the third death, thereby enabling th e Individuality to assert itsel f. But"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"if the third death be incomplete the lower soul will continue to dream upon the Astral Plane; this leads us to the questi on of the Fifth Death. The 5th Death.

In the lower Hells he burns with de sire until the possibilities o f desire are burnt out. Desire t hen remains only as an abstract idea and is part of the Individuality . He then dies to the lower desires but continues to live in the higher de sires. These in their tur n he learns to be finite and mortal, he finds them to constitute barriers be tween himself and his Father `whose face he would b ehold’, and he desires to escape from them. He would n o longer love with t he personal love which loves a person, but the higher manifestation of love which itself is love an d loves n o person or thing but is a state of consciousness in which all is e mbraced. He then seeks freedom from the lesser love, a nd with this desire for escape from that which is goo d though finite in order to realise t he good that is infinite, causes the fifth death, and he is born into consciousness of the Individuality and lives upon the plane of the Individuality , perceiving `the face of his Father which is in Heaven’ but with th e waking of desire come again t he dreams and with the dreams come the recall into matter, the Spirit `beholding the face of its Father’ until consciousness is wear y with its brightn ess, clos es its eyes a nd sleeps, and sleeping, it dreams of its unfulfilled desires a nd so it is born again, for upon the plane of desire a state of conscious ness is a place, and as we desire so are we reborn, thus each man makes his own karma. It may b e asked how th en is it that men make for themselves su ffering and limitations which they could not desire? It is because they do not reap the fruits of fantasy but the fruits of actuality. They are given the results of that which th ey have per mitted themselves to desire, no t the thing they desire. To exemplify - th e man who de sired power would o btain vanity. To obtain power he would have t o desire the qualities which co nfer power - strength, foresight and wisdom. The man who desires p ower builds for himself the consciousness of the vain ego tist. The man who desires strength , foresight and wisdom, builds for himself the consciousness of power. The 6th Death. Is trance. In trance the body sleeps but the soul is awake.

The 7th Death. Is Initiation. In the Seventh Death consciousness is withdrawn from the personality and made one with the Individuality and then a man ever `beholds the face of his Father which is in Heaven’ even when he himself sojourns upon Earth. Thus it is that the Initiate is not as other me n. Initiation is a living death. Those who desire the things of the senses and the pride of life use the words `living death’ to explai n the most terrible fate that can befall a man, but those who have knowledge know that the living death means the freedom of the spirit brought through to the planes of matter. It means the consciousness of the Abiding Presence in the midst of the consciousness of the senses. It means awareness of Heaven whi le dwelling upon Earth. Therefore the Initiate goes to the living death which is f reedom while still in t he body, for death annuls the Law of Limitation, frees the potentialities o f the spirit, gives sight t o the blind, and power to the impotent. That for which we longed vainly in life we realise i n death, for death is life and life is death. To the wider consciousness the wom b is a grave an d the grave is a womb, the soul entering upon life, builds farewell to his friends who mo urn for him, and taking his courage in b oth hands, facing the great ordeal and submitting to suffering, enters upon life. His fi rst action in life is to draw breath. His sec ond action with th at breath is to set up a cry of distress, b ecause he entered upon the task of life with gr ief, and his aim in life is to make life bearable, but when h e enters the grave he passes through the gatewa y into the wider lif e of consciousness , and when the Initiate would p ass to the wider life of consciousness he passes through a gatewa y which symbolises de ath, and by his death to the things of desire he obtains freedom, and as one dead he walks am ong men. In the death in life, which is the freedom of the spirit in the bonds of the flesh, he transcends the Law of Limitation, being de ad he is free, being de ad he moves with power among those buried in the flesh, and they, seeing the Light s hining brightly through h im, know that he is dead, for the Light cannot shine through that consciousness, but when conscious ness is discarnate the Light shi nes through , and if the discar nate consciousness is still manipulating its body, then that life shines through into the world of matter and illumin ates man.

The Law of Impactation, or the Transmission of Action from One plane to Another. The true method of Impactation is but little kn own because it involves the inner princi ples of polarity. Impactation may be defined as the act of bringing a force of a subtler plane through to a denser plane upon the involutio nary arc. This must be distinguish ed from de- gradation. De-gradation is a similar ac t upon the evoluti onary arc. We speak of the de-grad ation or the sublimation of a force upon the evol utionary arc, and of impactation and disintegration upon the involutionary arc. An important concept concerning th e dynamic st andard of good and evil is contained in this distinction. Impactation then is the act of advancing a force in evolution by d eveloping it u pon the `form’ aspect. You must remember that the stream of evolving life issuing from the Logos has to descend into matter in or der to be organised, and having develo ped `form’ by its c onfinement in matter it uses that form as a mould, or more strictly speaking, a framework (for the subtler surrounds the dense), and when the framework o f the dense is withdrawn, the subtle maintains the form it assumed because the system of stresses t hen develo ped becomes a habit. The act of sublimation is t o separate the dense from the gross an d the gross from the subtle. But the act of impactation is to lock two tangential forces of the subtle into a node of the dense. This, you wi ll perceive, was th e method of the creation of the atom. Let us make this clear by example. It is desired, let us suppose, to realise an abstract concept in concrete form. To do this it m ust be realise d that there are two sides to every question and that each side has elements of good and bad - construc tion and destruction. Construc tion of the higher m eans destruction of the lower. All things di e to the birth. The involutio nary and evolutio nary aspect of every problem has to be envisaged. Perceiving then these two as pects you will see that there are certain considerations which if regard ed alone, would lead you to proceed in the opposite directio n to that which you contemplate. That is to say, you would abandon your original intention and turn back towards t he centre. Other considerations, however, induce you to press out towards t he circumference, you will therefore always find, in every consideration, you ar e torn two ways. A unanimous decision is impossi ble, and it is a unanimous decision which is ne cessary in order to bring to birth upon a denser plane that which is conceived u pon a subtler plane. It is, therefore necessary, that in such a matter you sh ould have co-operation from an entity of a different type t o your own, s o that the consideration will be reversed , so that that aspect of yoursel f which would ret urn to the centre finds itself complemented by a similar aspect in the co-op erator which would press outwards towards the circum ference - not two h alves but four quarters. Then comes the figure of the excha nge of partners and you have two wholes ins tead of four halves. One wholl y positive an d one wholly negative. One turns back towards t he centre. One sets"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"out towards th e circumference. They come into align ment and the force can pass through them. The force intensifies all qualities. That which sets towards the centre draws towards t he centre. That which s ets towards the circum ference draws towards t he circu mference. Then comes re-pol arisation . Each of the two h alves temporarily joined draws apart and affects re-pol arisation within its elf into a positive and negative aspect - conscious ness and subconscious ness - personality and Individuality - and re-forms itself. You then have four wholes on two pla nes. This is a subject which requires m editation. It cannot be comprehended without a key. Have you re alised t he import of that which h as been given? We have given you t he lock, but the key cannot be given you so freely. The key must not be written down. The drawing apart of that which inclin es towards t he centre from that which inclin es towards t he circumference explains many things. Firstly the gulf between personality and Individuality and heredity .... That which is pr ojected into the denser, being formed from the framework of the subtler, retains the stress h abit of its original. Equally, when the process is n ot that of the normal advance of life, but a special o peration undertaken at the bidding o f the will - not the desires - t hat which is impacted is a reflection of the combined nature of the impactors. The impactors, therefore, although they separate according to the Law of Reaction and the Law of Magnetism that like repels like, are permanently linked by m eans of the common bond to that which they have cre ated. The symb ol is that of the inverted A in which th e two converging bars represent the creators. The cross bar the line of demarcation between the planes, and the lower inc omplete triangle the created. The cross b ar is kn own as the bar of impactation and you will see its vital signific ance in all practical o perations based upon this principl e. The bar of impactation must be included in the projected aspect in order to complete it and make of it a triangle, t he simplest form of closed figure. The impactors can then detach themselves at the line of demarcation and be free to function as independent units upon their own pl ane, but the system of magnetic stresses remains behind attached to the bar of impactation which f orms the upper line of the triangle, a nd when the triangle se eks to cross t he bar and develo p into the mighty Alpha it follows the lines already laid down. Now these lines, being projec tions into subtle matter of the basic a ngle of the triangle, enable conscious ness of the type of the impactors to contact it. Hereby you se e the way in which th e Master approaches the pupil. There are two kinds of birth. Firstly that which is in the ordinary course of nature; and the incarnation of a consciousness of a loftier grade than that which requires manifestation in matter for its develo pment. In the latter case the soul impacts its elf with the assistanc e of another of a similar grade . The one which de sires to manifest presses towards th e circumference, and its partner in impactation returns towards th e centre, but these two maintain contact by t he prolongation of the angles. And when consciousness is raised you get the symb ol of the six pointed star which is the symbol of Initiation. This explains t he phenomenon of four quart ers instead of"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"two halves. It explains the phenomenon of the Christ a nd the Jesus, and of all great er and lesser selves. There are, no doubt, many points in the foregoing remarks o n which you wi ll meditate before you wi ll perceive their signific ance. The act of impactation is based upon the use of the Laws of the Attraction of the Centre and the Attraction of the Circum ference, and the use of polarity, and in all elaborations of the concepts of polarity the Law of Impactation comes into function because polarity gives rise to impactation, and impactation depends on polarity wherein u nion takes place horizontally and fissure takes place vertically. Chapter XXIX. The Law of the Aspects of Force or Polarity . Just as it was impossible t o consider the Law o f Impactation without considering the Law of Polarity, so it is impossi ble to consider t he Law of Polarity withou t considering the Law of Attraction of the Centre and the attraction of the circumference, because Polarity has its basis in t hese two laws. It is acc ording to whether the attraction be towards t he centre or the circum ference that the negative or positive aspects of force are observed. The attraction towards the centre gives the negative, and the attraction towards t he circum ference the positive aspect, and it is those two in polarity that produce the circulati on of force. You see the prototype of which this is the corresp ondence, in the positive and negative aspects of the Cosmic Rays. The glyph of this is c ontained in the Caduceus of Mercury . There you se e the black and white serpents of positive and negative functions twined from side to side of the staff. Taken in its m undane aspect the staff represents the Ray and the black and white serpents the positive and negative as pects of the Life-wave. A glyph needs generally for its understanding the superimposition of another glyph belonging to the next plane, thus representing a practical applicatio n of the Law of Impactation. Place upon the glyph of Mercury - otherwise Hermes, Lord of the Mind - t he glyph of Orpheus, Lord of the Elementals, place the musical scale upon the staff of wisdom and you will see the places m arked off on the staff. Then place the inverted A with its b asal angle u pon whatever plane you wish to consider and you wi ll see the implication of the prolongatio n of the angle. You will then perceive that, that which appears as a unity upon one plane is pr olonged into a duality upon the subtler p lanes. Take the two points of your duality, reduce them a plane according to the Law of Corresp ondences, taking th ese two lower points as the basal angles of the upper A and you can circumscribe your hexago n. You will then see that the highest angle of your hexagon is i n exact c orrespo ndence with the lowest angle, and that the two side Rays upon each side may b e connected by lines r epresenting th eir respective affinities. This gives you the clue to the horizont al and vertical pol arity which is th e Cross o f Regeneration. Polarity according to the horizontal account is horizontal - two of a kind, opposite in type. Polarity according to the esoteric concept is vertical and has its clue in corresp ondence. Place the Cross on the hexagon, a nd the hexagon o n the Caduceus and you wi ll see the signific ance. Let the basal point of the six-pointed star rest upon the densest"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"plane under consideration. Let each pair of lateral p oints rest upon a plane, and let the transverse bar of the Cross be the bar of impactation, you wi ll then see the manner in which any given set of forces will work. This is a method of divination. Now in considering th e Caduceus, which is t he symbol of polarity upon the planes, note that the serpent as it passes from side to side of the staff goes from the positive to the negative side of the Ray. This will teach you that a force which is po sitive upon one plane will be negative upon the plane above; whet her you ar e considering th e emanations of the Zodiac or the levels of consciousness this is equally true. Polarity is alwa ys inverted, plane by pl ane. This will give you a further clue to the signif icance of the four quarters. If you raise c onsciousness you ch ange polarity. Whenever un ion takes place between two aspects upon a plane, they develop a similar magnetism and becoming repellent thereby they are forced apart. If therefore contact is m ade upon but a single pl ane, repulsion and estrangement follows, but if contact takes place upon more than one plane alternation of magnetism is s et up and a circuit o f the type of a figure 8 is built. Four quart ers again. This holds good whether of men or of movements. Polarity upon the planes alwa ys exists as four quarters. This is the clue to much. You will have perceived in the foregoing teachings, certain a pplications of the abstract to the concrete which it is not expedient should be concreted even in the abstract. Taking these as your basis proceed further. When one desires to project a manifestation from a subtler p lane to a denser plane on the involuti onary arc, it summonses to its assistance another, and the two d etach and project each a part of their substance. Viewed f rom the denser plane the projection appears as one; viewed from the subtler plane the projection appears as it really is - a projection. Whenever the one is considere d it is n ecessary for its understanding to project it into the subtler planes until it reveals t he two, for of the dual nature it would par take, and it is this duality of nature which is the clue to so much in both men and things, t herefore remember that when dealing with any form, one can alwa ys be resolved into two, and for a production of a new obj ect two ar e always essential, and it is u pon this subtle action and reaction and balance of force that ultimate issues depend. Thought will enable you t o perceive that you h ave her ein an expla nation of the basis o f physical generation, you have also the expl anation of the creation of `familiars’ or artificial e lementals which th ough abused, have their uses. It is possible, however, to create and project a thought-form without the interposition of a second entity by polarising the personality and Individuality. Normally , if you read correctly the glyph of Hermes, you will perceive that the polarity of the seven bodies is alternating a nd opposite. If you effect the re-polarisatio n so that the whole personality should be negative, and the whole Individuality positive you effect the condition in which creation of minor forms is possible within the entity. These, however, cannot sustain any independent life, but have to be fed and maintained by their parent. This polarisation is e ffected by neutralising the characteristic activity of each body of the personality, and intensifying the activities of each body of the Individuality so that all inhibitions are removed, and this produces a state of"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"instability, and therefore cannot be sustained for long. You will perceive that here you have c ertain important clues to the practice o f that which induces that which is not in that which thinks it is, but is not. The opposite process in which you have the inhibition o f the Individuality and the intensification of the personality produces a certain type o f mundane genius which b urns brightly to its own d estruction. You will perceive then that there is the co-operation of the two for the production of the third, and the re-polarisation of the two a spects of the entity for the projecti on of an expressio n. There is als o another aspect upon group form. The consciousness of a group is an entity of a negative or female type. It requires to be stimulated by a positive force before it can become creative. That which functions on a subtler plane is positive in relati on to that which functions on a denser plane. Should a conscious ness conceive the aims of a group on a higher plane than that on which the group conceives them, it becomes positive towards t hat group and thereby can fertilise it. When fertilisati on of a group occurs e ach of the individuals of that group becomes pregnant with a new life and brings cre ative work to birth upon the physical plane. They will then have conceived t hat which the group leader has begotten and will then be upon the same plane as the Leader. Having conceived the same ideal they will then be of the same polarity as the Leader and it will no longer be possible f or him to bring a creative sti mulus t o that group. This will explain to you the process of florescence and degeneration which groups undergo, but periods of quiesc ence are not of necessity death. You will observe th at throughout all manifested life the co-operation of two factors is essential for all `form’ building. Force , howeve r, works as a unit because its polarity is in the Logos. Chapter XXX. The Law of the Attraction of Outer Space. In considering the Law of the Attraction of Outer Space we have f irst to enquire h ow it is that the attraction of outer space is able to overcom e the attraction of the centre. In order to understand this problem we have to consider certain b asic aspects of the universe which have been previously describe d. The Logoidal c onsciousness, having attained equilibr ium, has achieved p erfection, and having attained that which it h ad conceptually realised, propounds a further conception and seeks its realisatio n. These formal concepts alre ady conceived within the Logoidal c onsciousness are continued into more complex syntheses, thereby partaking of the nature of succeedingly developed phases of manifestation, or to express t he same idea in another terminology, are passed outward down the planes of manifestation. The growing points of the Logos are projected into manifestation as evolution ary impulses. The thrust outward t hen, is initi ated by the Logos and form succeeds form in phases of manifestation down the planes, the will of the Logos which proj ects the forms, ensouling t hem with life. Now it is ever the aim of will to function unconditioned, just as it is ever the tendency of form to condition the unmanifest, and the will-to-live of the Logos"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"always entering up on the conditioning form, (which, as it were, it pushes ahead of itself down the planes,) is irked by th e form; but in the later phases of the Logoidal life unconditioned will is impossible, a ll action being determined by preexistin g conditions, and the will-to-live of the Logos, which is the life of the manifested universe, h as to submit to conditions and be bound in form. Hence the warfare between spirit and flesh. The life and will of the Logos then, expresses its elf through s ucceeding ph ases of form until the densest phase is reached. It can no further project the conditioning vehicle o f its manifestation, and it strives to free itself from the bondage of form, and continue onwards - to employ a metaphor of space - towards th ose areas of the ether which have not been circumscribed and conditioned by the primal Logoi dal will. It is the endeavour of conditioned life to become unconditioned which f orms the prime urge - which projects it towards o uter space. Secondly there is the natural tendency towards equilibriu m, and of the forces under high pressure within a manifested universe to diffuse themselves int o the comparative vacuum of outer space. Thirdly there is the picture of the penumbra - all those moulds which are marred in the making - all those evolu tionary concepts which f ail in their realisati on - all m isplaced forces and souls that have failed in their tasks, b eing reject ed by their Individuality - all th at in fact, which it is d esired to reject from the Logoidal conscious ness and which has been disintegrate d agains t the inner shell of the Ring- Pass-Not, remains as an image in the reflecting ether of space upon what may be figuratively termed the outer surface of the Ring- Pass- Not immediately between that and the Ring Ch aos of that universe, and there may b e descried. Any consciousness then which vent ures to the nether side of matter will discern a cross the grea t gulf, which is th e Ring- Pass-Not o f the universe, t he reflected images o f all falsified hopes and abortive attempts at manifestation - and these , as it were, cravin g for the force which sh ould bring them into manifestation, call a cross th e gulf to whatever elements are akin to them in that which presents its elf at the barrier, and so it is that all evol ving force whet her in the universe or in the Individuality , having penetrated to fundamentals, looks across th e great gulf fixed by Cosmic l aw and sees the simulacra of its hopeless d reams promising f ulfilment, and is tempted to continue forward on that path of outgoing upon which the Divine momentum projected it, and by me ans of the further momentum acquired by its own mo tion to leap that gulf into the freedom of outer space where t here is no law and men are as gods. F or when a unit of conscious ness escapes from a manifested universe by transcending law , because law is consummated in a perfect obedience, it becomes the nucleating ce ntre of a new Log oidal Sun, this is the mystery of Godhead; but when a unit of consciousness that has not mastered the law so escapes, it is an unconditioned will, this is t he mystery of evil, personified as devil. This temptation of the nadir comes to all in the course of evoluti on. From the Divine upon the outgoing arc li fe has to penetrate into the fundamentals, and having touched the fundamentals, having attained the summit of its powers, it has to reject the temptation of the desire-images re flected from"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"outer space and retrace its steps in humility back to the source of its life, winning the realisati on that freedom is attained, not by escape from limitations and conditions, but by adjusting the balance to a perfect equilibrium. Equilibrium of conflicting forces, being attained, form is stereotyped and can be left to form the corresponding consciousness , and the ensouling li fe withdraws to a higher plane bearing with it the reaction-capacity acquired on the lower plane, but no longer bound by the conditions of that plane. This will be dealt with mo re fully in the succeeding lecture. The attraction of outer space then,is the attraction of unconditioned power , it is the temptation to escape from the laws that have built us up, and to exercise t he powers gained under these laws withou t the equivalen t responsibility . This may be seen exemplified in the life of the man who, en joying all the advantages o f a highly developed culture, brings to them the aims and the ideals of an unevolved state of existence. The attraction of outer space is the temptation to break awa y from evolution and the Cosmic law and to function as a god. Such gods are those who ar e propitiated in the rites o f devil worship. Chapter XXXI. The Law of the Attraction of the Centre. The Law of the Attraction of the Centre contains the secret of the myst ery of Love. It may be considered under three aspects:- Firstl y in relation to evoluti on, secondly in relation to Initiation, and thirdly in relation to devolutio n and the left-hand path. (1) In relation to evolu tion. When a form of life has attained its u tmost complexit y of material organisati on, unification begins. This is obtained by means of synthesis u pon a higher pl ane, and this having been secured, devolution of the physical f orm set in. This marks the transition through the nadir of the evolution ary arc. Let us elaborate this concept. Ideas of life expressio n, having been evolved by entities of a higher grade than the life-forms under considera tion, such ideas are projected upon these life-forms in the etheric kingdo m as they are approaching ma terialisa tion, and in the malleable matter of the etheric type they are worked o ut, and this acts as a framework f or the subseque nt physical form. The life forces, compelled to circulat e in the forms built in m atter, develop a set of magnetic str esses. These having been develo ped, the material form can be discarded, and the system of magnetic stresses r emains as an etheric mo uld. Thus does an inceptive idea pass through the plane of manifestation of matter and become a conceptive idea. There are many different devices em ployed for obtaining the same result, and though each of these owes its inception to a different inceptive idea - a different attempt to work out a design - th e conceptive idea of perfect adaptation is the same for all. So that that which was multipicity in its origin, by the perfection of its develo pment arrived at unity. One is the symbol of the First Manifest. Whatever reduces multiplicity to unity - or a `complex concrete’ to a `simple abstract - is approaching the centre. The approach to the centre is no t a movement in space, but a unification. Now note the difference between unification and simplification, because this is t he clue to much. Unification"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"is achieved by evoluti on and simplification is a chieved by devolutio n. Unification is t he full synth esis - simplification is the ultimate analysis, or re turn to type. One is the advance ment to completion, the other is a re-gression to the commencement. The concept of the return to the centre might be considered as an extension of the centre, for when return to the centre takes place the centre is th ereby exten ded, and we are taught that the return to the centre is t he goal of evolutio n. If this idea be meditated upon it will be seen that such a return to the centre should involve th e extension of the centre, for if all that is extern al becomes internal the boundary must be extended. In very truth it may be conceived t hat the return to the centre means that the centre is ext ended to the circumference and all things are as is the centre. This implies the spiritualisati on of all the planes. Such a concept has two aspects - the form aspect and the force aspect. Force flows toowards t he centre, withdraw ing from the circumference. It therefore follows that the centre, to accomodate it, must flow out. Thus it is the substance of each plane, having had its native form withdrawn, is rec ast by the influences of the extending centre into approximat e forms to those which prevail upon the seventh plane. The withdraw ing of force marks the end of a Cosmic Da y and the beginning of a Cosmic Night. The outflowing of the centre is the work of the Cosmic Night - an d the secrets of the Cosmic Night have n ever been revealed before. The outflow of pure spirit over all pl anes of matter takes place during t he Cosmic Night, a nd the Archetypal forms remaining in the vicinity of the magnetic stress es are thereby galvanised , but they have no real life, having as yet no reincarnating principle, and therefore no memory. And at the end of the Cosmic Night the spiritu al tides withdraw leaving the field to the emptiness of the Cosmic Da wn. But the forms over which th e Cosmic Tide has flowed have b een adjusted to Cosmic stresses a nd therefore all types o f evil have been correct ed. This is the cleansing of matter which t akes place between each Cos mic Day and neutralises the forces of inertia, and as the forces of inertia have their roo ts in the Law of Limitation, and the Law of Limitation has its roots in C osmic evil, you will see the significance of the work of the Cosmic Night, a nd you also see the deeper signific ance in the words `The Powers o f Darkness’. It is necessary, if you are to understand the deeper implicatio ns of occultism, that you s hould see that darkness leads through twilight into dawn, a nd day lea ds through twi light to darkness . Good and evil may be conceived o f as areas of light and shadow through which a spinning ring evolved, a nd evil has its work to do as well as good. The God of Light and the God of Darkness are but the actions of the Right a nd the Left Hand of the Father. The Right-Han d gives and the Left-Hand takes away . The Right- Hand gives that which is to be, and the Left takes away that which has been. The Right sends out into manifestation and the Left beckons back agai n; but you, looking as in a mirror, call Right Left, and Left Right. The attraction of the Centre takes place up the path of returning, a nd should that attraction set in prematurely it causes the life to flow back to an earlier aspect. This involves a devolution of life before there is a devolu tion of"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"form. When this returning flow takes place in relation to Life we see the development od parasitic types o f existence. This explains the problem of bacterial dis ease - other types of life which are saprophytic are not of this evolu tioon at all, but are functioning un der the dominion of the `Lords o f the Dark Face’ who are scavengers o f the Gods. It may b e said, in parenthesis, t hat there are two types of bacterial disease - parasitic an d saprophytic - which m ay occur independently or simultaneously. This is an idea which could be elaborated but it will not be done now. You will perceive from the foregoing that a return to the centre means a fading of a Day of Manifestation, and as the daylight fades the spiritu alising dark ness of the unmanifest flows over the fields of matter. And this must always be borne in mind in considering this problem, for as the light withdraws from the outer circuit o f matter, so the spiritualising influences begin to flow out from the innermost circuit of spirit, and this process continues until suc h time as all light be withdrawn, an d the concentric circle o f manifestation be completely overflowed with t he Cleansing W aters of Darkness; but meanwhile th ere is a transition stage d uring which the Waters of Darkess, which is a synbol of peace, cleansing an d regeneration, make preparation for new life. These waters th en, are percolating t hrough t he planes of manifestation so that the seen will be interpenetrated by the unseen. This brings us to the second aspect of the subject of the attraction of the centre, the question of Initiation. (2) In relation to Initiation. Those entities that have re turned to the centre at the conclusio n of their evolutio n flow out again a s the foreunners of the Shadow of the Spirit. It is these who ar e the Initiators. They themselves have been enabled to progress in advance of evolution by being themselves initiated by develo ped entities of previous evoluti ons according to the planes on which they took Initiation, the Lords of each plane being the completed fruits of the evolutio n which ha d its culmination on that plane. These are the Initiators of each evolutio n until those who are Initiated, themselves having passed through the life, are proceeding outwards again . By the action of these entities those who a re Initiated proceed from the surface to the substratum of their plane and it is only when t he Waters of Regeneration have penetrated through t he cracks a nd fissures o f receptive co nscious ness to a plane, that Initiation can take place on that plane. Thus it is that at this stage the grea ter illumination can only take place out of the body, for in this phase of evoluti on the Waters of Regen eration have n ot yet reached the physical plane. (3) In relation to devolutio n. The attraction of the centre has a third aspect in devolutio n, or the way of the left-hand path if applied to consciousness . In relation to evolu tion, devolu tion means the withdrawal of life from any given type of form, and the disintegratio n of these forms. The systems of magnetic stresses which lif e generated in them are then left as empty shells upon the etheric sub-planes. These shells sh ould wait the cleansing of the Waters of Regen eration that flow out in the tide of the Cosnmic Night. It sometimes happens, however, that souls which ar e"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"sufficiently develop ed have re ached the point when t hey feel the attraction of the centre upon the path of returning, yet are insufficiently developed in certain a spects to be ready for evolution because they have not yet su fficiently undergone involutio n, these may set out to return to the centre before they have passed the nadir. They will then be moving through planes from which th e life has withdrawn a nd whereon lie the empty shells awaiting the coming of the tides of the Cosmic Night. These souls wi ll then avail themselves o f the systems of magnetic stresses of primitive types for the expression of their functions. This will explain much if meditated upon. When, however, these souls, having outworn and destroyed the shells, a nd thereby impeded subsequent evolutio n, continue on their devolutionary path, they reach a point where t here are no more shells f or their ensouling, a nd they will then be unable to maintain form, and will dissolve int o the unorganis ed elements of substance and cease to be potent for evil or potential for good. That is the record of the left-hand path. Evolution by th e right- hand path is accomplished through the withdrawal of the perfected life from the forms which separate - the synthesis o f the principles which t he forms were designed to express - th e sublimation of the principles into ideals, and the realisatio n of the ideals by Cosmic consciousness . Such is the record of evolution upon the right- hand path. It will be seen then, that the essence of evolutio n is unification and the manifestation of the unificatory principle upon the planes of manifestation is Love. W hether that love be intellectual sympa thy on the plane of the concrete mind, or physical unity on the plane of matter, Love i n all its a spects is the symbol of the Logos as One. The aim of evoluti on is to make all things One, and upon the plane of manifestation there are but two things which make all things On e - death and Love. Death is the manifestation of the left-hand path, and Love is th e manifestation of the right- hand path. Whoso loves, h owever dim may be his concept of Love, is manifesting a unification and unification is t he goal of evolution. God is On e. Love m akes One - therefore it is tr uly said “Go d is Love”. Whosoever expresses Love bri ngs Spirit, wh ich is One, into manifestation. To be loving is to be good. Whosoever expresses hate brings separateness into manifestation. To be separate is to be dead. Therefore choose Love and live. ___________________ Additional Information: The additional material se t out here has the same authority as the body of the work, bu t was communicated some years a fter it.

Exa mination of the ” Ray-type “ of an individual would call for Sidereal Astrology - a far more complicated and deep astrology than astrology as now prac tised. (2) The Lords of Flame and the Lords of Mind do not meet upon the planes in the progress o f the First Three Swarms, b ut there is a process a t a later date where by a Lord of Flame can as it were fuse with a Lord of Mind, thus becoming to all intents a Lord of Mind. The process is ver y difficult to describe : there takes place a kind of absorption so to speak, somewhat c omparable to the coalescenc e of an Individuality with a highly developed Personality in a human incarnation, somewhat comparable but not the same. A Lord of Mind who chooses to carry on certain work for a Lord of Flame absorbs the ” experienc e “ of the Lord of Flame somewhat in the manner that an Individuality absorbs the experience of a Personality (but in this cas e the comparison is reversed since the Lord of Mind c orrespo nds to the Personality absorbing the experienc e of a Lord of Flame corres ponding to the Individuality) and goes forth as a Lord of Mind with the far-off contact (of a Lord of Flame) still workin g behind him. Many of the Lords of Flame are what we now call the Archangelic Forces, o thers guide c ertain c onditions i n the universe and have a special co ntact with the Solar Logos. It is these latter which so to speak steep certain Lords of Mind in their experie nce and pass their influence into them, thus working through them. The Lords of Flame all have a n especially strong L ogoidal c ontact and some were what m ight be termed sent forth again a fter the First Swarm h ad finished its work. It can be of special benefit to meditate on the Three Primal Swarms b ecause that part of the book which de als with them was set down in a necessarily very approxima te manner suited to the ” average in tellect.” I t is important to bear in mind that all that i,, said is o nly an approxima tion and far more than a merely intellectual appreciation can be gained through meditation on the First Three Swarm. The material in The Cosmic Doctrin e is capable of immense expansion-expansion, indeed, beyond the present limits o f human understanding. (3) To try to put into comprehensible language and yet gi ve something a pproaching a n adequate delineation of the power and majesty of the Three Primal Swarms is a difficult task indeed. The descriptio n given in the body of the work conveys little idea of the mighty work undertaken and performed by those Swarms. Those great Waves of Cosmic Life which built the Laws governing the universe, evol ution and man are of great importance at all times and especially at the inception of a new Age. Their influence remains behind in man and the universe, a nd according as man is in touch with t hese primal beginni ngs when his own Life-Spark first entered manifestation even so is t he type of his Individuality determined. He c annot even now get away from those early stages o f development because as his Essential Self took on the influences and reacted to them in the formative stage of his evolu tion so does each human being at this stage still carry the latent consciousness of those primal actions and reactions. He c arries eternally the seed of his own beginning even a s the oak carries eternally the acorn within it, and, as the acorn reacted to the soil in which it grew, as it received the air and the sun, in what measure its gro wth was made and it gradu ally cast off its outer shell and began to"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"shoot and become an oak tree, so in a sense did man first begin to become man. As a man reacted to the various pl anes through which he passed in these primal stages of the Life-Spark-and even then there was a measure, however small, of individual reaction - even so is that man today. As the Spark came down the planes, gathered substance from each plane, and then returned up again h e met other Sparks doing the same thing, and so again is it in his life today. In this mass of Sparks on its first descent of the planes there were so me which formed a smaller ma ss within th e whole, touching ea ch other more than other Sparks o r Groups of Sparks in the whole. Thus did certain s pecial re actions - “friendships” a s it were- begin in t he primal stages; and in later days o f evolutio n those same Sparks, clot hed with matter of all planes passed through, ag ain met those others equally clothed with matter of all planes passed through which h ad first contacted them in the primal stages. In passing t hrough t he planes the matter or s ubstance of each plane was interwo ven into the inner vehicles of man and in time built the different forms or vehicles we know now by var ious names (e. g. the “ Astral Body, “ “ Me ntal Body,” etc.) and these bodies have a lso certain subdivis ions. The great p lanetary spheres thr ough which ea ch atom and Divine Spark passed in the course of evolutio n also had a certain type o f influence over it a nd in a way this is t he basis of astrology, though the roots of that study are largely lost and forgotten. Astrology cannot be applied nowadays as the ancient races conceived it b ecause of change am ong the heavenly bodies, and man himself is changing also. In his passage down t he planes the evolving being ca me into contact with g reat planetary Powers which still exercise so me control over hi m-though he may not be aware o f it-for he has matter within his m ake-up which ret ains a form of contact with those great p lanetary Powers and their influence on his body, mind, and karma still remains at very primitive levels: f or example the Force describ ed as ” The Great Mother ” still remains The Great Mother of all living beings a nd the degre e to which a modem man can consciously become aware o f this contact is of importance to him. The great Laws of the Unive rse were made long before what we call “ man “ had evolved s ufficiently to come down the planes in the same manner as had come down the great a toms and group- forces which in t he beginning built the Universal P owers. The “ Group-Souls “ o f these latter are behind what we call the great archetypes a nd with these arc hetypes esoteric students can be much concerned. And as man eventually returns up the planes at the end of a chain of evolutio n he reaches on another level his own beginnings. He becomes as it were a god, a type of Logos, in himself at the end of many evolutio ns gathering together the great chains of experienc e which w ill have ma de himself no longer the individual b ut in a sense a group from which other units of mind-force emanate. For man begins as a group and individualises ou t of the grou p as evolutio n goes o n and in the end has to return to his own group which is then himself. Behind that teaching is t he ” Collective Princi ple ” or collective sense which, partly or even wrongl y understood as it often is, can be found in certain p olitical id eals and systems. This sense has a high ethical b asis and strives so to form the character that all should act as one, should act as a team and in a team ; for it is the greatest, most intricate and first Divine Law when properly understood. Nevertheless, u ntil the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"individual be developed to his highes t, he cannot be part of the collective unit of Divinity to which he should in the end return. And in each man is that which makes the Trinity - the Three Aspects o f the Manifesting Godhead - and these Aspects are in his innermost Spirit as its highest e thic. When this evoluti on will have finished, the experience and matter of this plane (Earth) will be garnered up and will pass on to other evolutio ns in other planets and some of its life- forces wi ll return again in another guise t o this planet again. When a man dies portions of his astral and etheric bo dies are probably lost for a while to his Individuality, but also they often go to make up certain parts of the new astral and etheric bodies he will have in h is new incarn ation. That, in a few words, is what h as happened all through evol ution-the form is broken up and the parts are carried on to build up the form of the next type o f life-form ; but it is not always known th at particles o f the denser vehicles- not the physical, b ut the astral an d etheric-the disintegrat ed astral an d etheric bodies of people who h ave die d, go to make up other Personalities. These Personalities m ay belong later to those Individualities from whos e former Personalities th e parts come, but it also happens that they may not, and Individualities o ften have Pers onalities co mposed of material which previously has been used in the vehicles o f others. This sometimes can account for strange re actions between people in incarnation, so that it is not always necessary to look to meetings in previous lives to explain suc h reactions . As the human being is in this way so, too, are planets and other heavenly bodies. Planets contain portions of other planets and of other Cosmic ti mes and other evolutions built into their auras, just as this earth is in t he aura of the moon* and has contact with ma ny “ lunar particles ” o f a former evolutio n. Life in its many-sidedness is n ot simple by any means, it is woven into a vast p attern which only very advanc ed Inner Plane Adepti can realise, a nd there is no pattern that is not in some way linked with all the rest. (4) The Planetary Being evolves with the planet and correspo nding plane. Its “ bodies “-up to the full complement of seven - and its content of conscious ness incr eased with the arrival and departure of the various Swarms. The activities of the Swarms 4- 7 were governed by the “ Lords ” of the Three Primary Swarms. Not until a Planetary Being ha d developed its full complement of ” bodies” could it take a Swarm t hrough t he full circuit o f -evolutio n, and not until then did the evolutio n begin of those Sparks which b ecame “ human beings “ as we un derstand the term. During th e descent of the first seven Swarms the influence -of the Logos r emained paramount in the universe, a nd any unbalance resulting from the epigenetic activities of the Swarms 4-7 was immediately correct ed so that the ” bodies ” o f the Planetary Beings we re not affected. After the full complement of seven b odies has been acquired by the Planetary Being, however, the influence of the Logos does not fully correct any unbalance because influences from the now fully embodied Planetary Beings intervene. It is at this point that epigenetic factors lay the foundations of individual basic Karma. Each Planetary Being is a stage b ehind the human evolution proceeding in its sphere, and thus acts as a drag upon it. (5) The Three Primary Swarms ca n be aligne d (through the Logos) w ith"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"the three Cosmic Rings and with the Essences of the Four Elements as follows: - * The present moon is not here referred to; the previous moon left behind it substance which goes t o make up the aura of the earth. This previous m oon left much substance, too, for the present moon, and a great deal of its “powers” or in fluences ar e there, but many, too, of its primitive powers and certain very important factors rem ain within t he earth (in what e soterically is called the “ Inner Earth ”), and both these are as well joined into one huge aura which is ar ound both the present moon -and the earth. (1) The Lords of Flame with t heir great “ stress es of movement “ appertain to the Ring Cosmos and to the Element of Fire. (2) The Lords of Form appertain to the Ring Chaos and to the primal Earth/Water Essence (the Elements of Earth and Water). (3) The Lords of Mind appertain to the Ring- Pass-Not a nd to the Element of Air. Individualism ca n reach a certain limit o nly and then is turned back on to a higher arc o f collectivism. The limits of the human mind are a safeguard of the human race. (6) There will come a time when the planetary spheres no longer h old any Swarms p assing d ownwards on the arc of involution. When this occurs th e condition left behind by the last Swarm wi ll gradually dissolve an d for a space nothing will happen. Then there will gradually come in a ” type of vortex “ from outside the plane, something that is seeking development, a kind of non- human “being” which will then go through an involutio n on a small scal e on the empty plane. It will be a very simple kind of life and it will event ually be drawn down to the physical pla ne; only an experienced student of the subtler sides of esotericism could ge t any un derstanding of this form of life-something approaching a new type o f Elemental is as adequate a descripti on as any. It should even tually have a c onnection with a Div ine Spark of a much more limite d range than the Divine Sparks o f the human beings. The subject is a very difficult one to put in words even f or approxima te ideas; it is in a ny case, very remote but has interest. (7) The Life-Swarms 4-7 are the common origin o f all humanity; in their passage d own the planes they have created the great archetypes o f humanity and the basic human instincts. They represent a great Group Soul, a collective sta te from which individual man has grad ually emerged. They have m ade that aspect of the universal Laws which are portrayed in the “ god-forms.” Not until these Laws had become establishe d did man begin to emerge f rom this grou p-state, his e mergence correspo nding with the acquisition by t he Planetary Beings o f their full complement of bodies-seven in all. It is this group-state in man that forms the ”collec tive unconscious” o f mankind, the archetypes o f which o n the evolutionary arc (as dis tinct from the involutionary) man first contacts in dream and vision. Racial division, therefore, came after this group-state, emergence from which was the beginning of separateness. Community life in its highest sense remains a worth y ideal for its principles s eek to replace separateness with cooperation. These Swarms gradually built what m ight be caned the immediately prehuman shape - even at the time of the fourth Swarm it was still ver y “embryonic”. They are of especial int erest sinc e on the manner of progression o f the Swarms is ba sed the beginnings"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"of what ar e known as the “ Root Race “ types . In these prehuman stages is to be found much of the History of Man, while the gradual formation and develo pment of the Archetypes might b e called “ Pl anetary Embryolog y.” The human shape as we know it was est ablished by th e middle period of the seventh Swarm and the Archetypal f orms were du e in a sense to the projected concept of the Planetary Being its elf which brings through additional concepts of another type t han the Logoidal c oncepts though not necessarily conflicting w ith those concepts. (8) The three “activities” re ferred to in Chapter 3 as “Movem ent”, ”Light” a nd “Sound” may be aligned with th e three Supernal Sephiroth of the “Tree of Life.” The numbers assigne d to the Sephiroth are connected with th e numbers of the corresp onding atoms (i.e. of the facets). F6r example the terrible sim plicity of the three-sided atom and the use of three in Binah symbols are obviously related. The four Threes of the Tarot cards have the same basis. Both the “ Tree of Life “ and the Tarot will be found to be in line with th e tenets of the “ Cosmic Doc trine “ if the seeker me ditates seriously on the subjects. (9) The “ Divine Sparks “ and the Great Entity that is the Logos of our system have a common origin in t heir Pri me (Cos mic) Atoms which derive fr om the Great Unmanifest. These Prime Atoms of a Divine Spark before that Spark comes under the Logoidal influence can be called the “Seed Atoms.”* * This “ Seed Atom “ refers to the Cosmos and its difference from the “ seed atom “ me ntioned at the end of Chapter XII is plain. There is a continuity of develo pment from the Prime Atom formed as described in the early chapters to the Divine Spark in each one of us. Just as the Great Entity has evolved fr om the ten- sided, or travellin g, atom of the Cosmos (which itself evolved from the Prime Atom) so have the Divine Sparks evol ved from certain o f the less co mplex atoms brought into the wake of the Travelling Atom, or Great Entity, out of whose concepts the Great Entity has created and projected Its universe. The difference at this point between a Great Entity and a Divine Spark is o ne of degree but not one of kind for the Great Entity has experience of all the Rays but the Divine Spark has experience of only one Ray-both have experie nce of all the Planes. Certain of the atoms “ br ought over ” f rom the Cosmos to the Universe by the work of the Great Entity became the Travellin g Atoms of the Universe. They are not as complex as the Great Entity but are too complex to settle down upon a plane of manifestation and they return to the centre. These atoms “ brought over “ by th e Great Entity, which b ecome the Divine Sparks ar e those which in their journeying to the Centre have their “ track i n space “ impress ed with th e Logoidal I mage and Influence. Thereafter these Divine Sparks b ecame conditioned by the Logoidal Consci ousness until the cycle is completed and they became “ freed ” from this influence and return to their original n ucleus of being as Seed Atoms. There are, therefore, two ways of considering th e Divine Spark. You may look at it from the point of view of the Cosmos or from the point of view of Solar Logoidal evolu tion: but, in reality the Divine Sp ark is o ne thing having its origin in the Unmanifest from which it derives its existe nce and energy. The Divine Spark does not derive from the Solar Log os but is"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"conditioned by the evoluti on of the Solar L ogos until the cycle of its Solar development is co mpleted. This takes place when t he Individuality, as a result of certain evolutio nary processes in the Solar L ogoidal jurisdiction c omes to the point where it n eed no longer stay in that jurisdiction b ut is able to recognize its own true being. At that point it is as t hough the “ outer “ development of the Divine Spark dro ps awa y from it and it becomes again p urely a seed-atom to which the Individuality thenceforward owes its a llegiance. Thus at that stage the Divine Spark, being freed from the limiting in fluences of Solar evolution gives rise to that state of perfect freedom within t he Individuality, the state of spaceless a nd timeless existe nce - consciousness . The great responsibilit y that then devolves upon the Individuality on the ”Right-Hand Path” comes from that Individuality’s now established contact with pur e and limitless ”energy.” The Individuality is conditioned only by its d egree o f realisation of this contact as it enters on a phase of creative activity; in very truth a god. Advance d initiations ar e concerned with the degrees o f contact of the Individuality with th e inner aspect of the Divine Spark (the seed-atom) and the realisatio ns thereof. The cycle of Solar development is governed by the ”Lords o f Karma ’ ’ and it includes the working ou t of the “ tracks in s pace “ left by The ” karma “ whe n the karma h as itself been worked o ut, for the Solar development occurs after the “ track in space “ (of ‘the seed-atom) has received t he Logoidal Imprint. Thus until the completion of the Solar develo pment the Individuality is not able to bring through pure power w ithout some of the power being diverted to its own n eeds. There is, of course, a wide range of gradation between the earlier and later phases but, broadly speaking, th e earlier are essentially concerned with the gradu al bringing of the Individuality (after preliminary work on the Personality) into contact with its own tru e being - the seed-atom - whereas t he later are the true creative work of those who h ave achieved in cooperation with their brethren. The preliminary work on the Personality has to be thoroughly carried out before these phases are entered upon. (10) The “ inanimate atoms ” and the Divine Sparks have a common origin in t he Great Unmanifest. They have both been “ brought over “ by the Great Entity which is o ur Solar Logos and from the aggregate of their conceptions of their own images t he Great Entity has projected Its universe. Everything th at has “ life “ in the universe d erives that life from its own se ed-atom. It is the aim of the Solar evolutio n to unite eventually the atoms of its universe w ith their seed-atoms in the Cosmos. It has been stated that there is a difference of degree but not of kind between the travelling atoms of a universe an d that universe’s Logos: si milarly there is a difference of degree b ut not of kind between a travelling atom and an inanimate atom. Only the more evolved of the Cosmic a toms brought over by the Great Entity became travelling atoms in Its universe at the beginning o f the Solar evolutio n and received t he Logoidal Impress on their ” tracks in space.” These - not including t he First Three Swarms - which are different-relat e to the human evolution and among them are differences in degree of development caused by factors inh erent in their make-up. The inanimate atoms are less evol ved than the travell ing atoms"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"and receive the Logoidal I mpress duri ng the Solar evolu tion according to their degree of develop ment because being in and of the Solar u niverse (th eir concepts having been used to create it) they are continually being bathed in the Logoidal in fluences and slowly absorb them. In this way we get the Oversouls o f plant and animal life, these Oversouls d eriving from the inanimate atoms, which are gradually acquiring a Logoidal Impress. (11) The basic ”so und” of a human being is im plicit in the development of a Divine Spark. The Logoidal I mpress can be more accurately conceived o f as a sound-vibration than a picture concept. This idea of primal or basic so und was behind the ancient teachings of number and numerical values. Sound implies rhythm and vibration . That “Aspect” of the Trinity of the Logos known as the Love-Asp ect is the part chiefly at work in the imprinting o f the Impress . The higher t eaching of the Church es is inspired by this . (I2) The three Primary Swarms were pr ojected into manifestation each under an impulse from one of the Prime Aspects of the Logos derived from one of the Primary Rings. These Primary Swarms, ar e set apart from the succeeding Swarms and are of a different degree. The Swarms t hat followed them develop ed under the influence of the Logos p lus the Three Primary Swarms, the Lords of Flame, Form and Mind. They are, therefore, under the influence of the three Cosmic Rings (as were the three Primary Swarms) b ut also, since the Logos reacts to the Twelve Cos mic Rays, th ese later Swarms are characterised by t he influence of the Rays predominant at the time they received the Logoidal impulse to go forth. Therefore the grea t phases of evolutio n between the sending forth of fresh Swarms are governe d by the influences from the Twelve Cosmic Rays. This has reference to the “ Houses “ o f the Cosmic Zodiac and to the precession of the Equin oxes. Those who energise these phases and typify them are Ray Exemplars; t hey sta nd, so to speak, between the Zodiac and the phases and reflect the Zodiacal in fluences, acting in a sense as Cosmic me diators. These influences then act upon the Planetary Beings. (I3) There are two o f the ancient god-f orms which ca n be called easily to mind as being readily alignable with the Essential Self, most other god-forms being representative o f particular aspects, Cos mic or u niversal. These two god-f orms are Horus a nd Eros. Of them the former could stand for the Divine Spark, the latter for the seed-atom. For all practical purposes we could say they ,stand for the outer and inner aspects of the seed-atom respectivel y. This supernal Er os is far removed from the popular conception which identifies him with Cu pid. He represents here the essence of Man which is Eros plus Anteros and springs from the Cosmic Egg like the philosophic concept of that Eros who was one of the -earliest of the Greek gods. This cosmogonic Er os was the earliest f orce bringing order out of Chaos and he presided at the Council o f the Gods and rules over the minds of gods and men: he was ,o ne of the gods o f the Samothracian Mysteries. (14) The star Sirius ha s always been held in esoteric teaching to have mu ch influence on Solar evolution. Astronomically speaking, of course, the position in space of Sirius is far outside the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"solar system but from a Cosmic st andpoint Sirius a nd many other stars ,,condition” t he Solar Logos and, since the Solar Log os is Itself Conditioner of and conditioned by Its universe, the influences of Sirius a nd other stars are transmuted correspondingly before being ,communicated to the universe. Therefore, in the purely esoteric s ense, stars in general and Sirius in particular (bec ause of its special in fluence) can be considered in relatio n to Solar evolutio n-more ,especially those which, like Sirius , have h ad a marked effect on it. The individual, howeve r, must have completed the cycle of Solar -develo pment before he can experienc e the pure influence of Sirius or other stars. (15) Orthodox s6ence studies the materials of which the body of the earth is made and their composition, but the ” deeps “ of the Inner Earth, the make-up of the Planetary Being is what is most important to esoteric studies. It can be helpful to think of the earth rather as a planet, a globe in the Solar system than as “ the world ” an d a development brought about by ma ny civilisations to one of which we now belong. That which sustained and nurtured those civilisations is t he Planetary Being. This tremendous force is s ometimes personalised a s “The Earth Mother,” but, personalisa tion or no, all should be aware of the gigantic f orce involved and of how they are beholden to it. The Archangelic Gui de assigned to the Planetary Being might be considered to supply higher as pects to it corresp onding to the “ Intellectual Principle ” in man. The names of these Archangelic G uides as known traditionally can be found in standard works of reference such as The Mystical Q abalah. (16) Each planet has within it the principl es of a universe (as indeed has the atom) so that the Group soul of the planet’s life comes through in aspects somewhat analogous to the Three Aspects of the Logos. There is something of the Aspect of “ Love, “ of “ Wisdom “ and - of “ Power ” in each planet. Planets have had their “ Le aders “ who have s hown forth certain princi ples by their conditions of life even as there have been Teachers who did this for the guidanc e of mankind. These planetary aspects affected certain sections of the human race for they affected the Life-Swarms a s they came down. Thus according t o the aspects prevalent on certain planets which were in c ontact with ma n as he then was so did a particular Swarm receive a conditioning. These great ” stress es of planetary substance ” have mu ch influence both in their own s phere and on the Earth because whe n the Earth was, so to speak, beginning its course in the heavens various in fluences and substances from different planets penetrated the then empty and uncoordinated mass which became the Earth: these stress es have l eft their mark on the Earth’s structure and innermost nature and account sometimes for disturbances of one kind or another-earthquakes, for example, for there is still a link between certain s ubstances in the Earth and the correspo nding su bstance in some other planet and the two activate e ach other and reactions are set up in both. That is largely the basis of the more accurate side of astrology , but it is too intricate and too remote for most today to study deeply or use as a basis of assess ment. In very early days the most advanced among the priesthood knew about the stellar a nd planetary ” stresses ” and the Earth’s magnetism and on that knowledge built a syste m of which, indeed, something re mains though the bases of the system have b een"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"forgotten. There are People on the Earth whose psychic f aculty can be stirred by such stresses ; some people, for example, are sensitive to earthquakes or atmospheric pressures in a way others are not. Such people have in t heir inner make-up some of the stresses corresp onding to those of the particular pl anet which is dist urbing the Earth. Certain planets influence the ”Water”, “Fire”, “Air ” and ”Earth” c onditions o f the Earth by acting on the Earth’s aura. The underlying princi ple is th at of the unity of all. The Earth is not unique; it should be considere d for what it is - o ne of the bodies in the Solar System which h as passed through s tates and conditions which h ave gradually condensed into what we call the ” Earth “ b ut which have passed down f rom the Moon, Venus, Saturn and other planets. The Planetary Beings can be considere d in one way as the Group Souls of the planets and may be given by the visual imaginati on a definite form - as indeed in ancient days was done. Out of these Planetary Beings as they affected the mind and character of man were later evolved by vision and imagination into astral forms the forces known to mythology. There is, therefore, a strong link between Planetary Beings an d the appropriat e god- forms as is studied by some eve n today. At the end of evolutio ns planets change over a nd different planets go in to action during t he succeeding evolutio n so that the subject of astrology at the present day has to contend with difficulties that are practically insurmountable. There is m uch to be learnt about the Life-Swarms a nd the way in which th eir coming down a ffects humanity generally in the present. All those ancient happenings an d developments must be included in any estimation of the condition o f man and his development. During th e various his torical peri ods certain Planetary Forces-for Planetary Forces is a more accurate descriptio n than ” Planets ”-in fluenced the Earth, each according to its special n ature; when these Forces ar e brought to bear again in their turn they bring to the surface conditions corresponding to their nature, they bring th em about in the Earth. Although we have used the term ” Planetary Forces “ we include also certain Stellar Forces work ing through the Solar jurisdictio n, such as the Signs of the Zodiac, but that subject is too vast to be dealt with in detail now. Bear in mind, however, the Sign o f Gemini, for the Forces signif ied by that Sign influenced Atlantis and will influence Earth again later in the present age. The stars are set in configurations somewhat similar to those which in fluenced the last days of Atlantis: certain m ajor Planetary Forces a nd Signs are influencing mankind again and though the combinations ar e different there is something o f the same kind of inner condition : the combinations are different but there is something of a similar in ner condition and the world, though not deluged by a water cataclysm, is f ull of clashes and strife of various kinds. (I7) Let us consider the Second Swarm, the life-wave of those grea t Regents of the Logos we call t he ”Lords of Form.” They might also be called the “ Builders ” f or through them all form, all shape is develope d. The shape that covers or encases the life consciousness is made by the Builders to hold that life for a time sufficient for the life to react as needed to the stress es of the Sphere on which it is a fter which the life withdraw s to another condition leaving the form to decompose into the elements of the Sphere.

The Lords of Form work with group souls more than with individuals b ut where a great teacher is instr ucting mankind (especially if the teaching concerns human evolu tion) the Lords of Form ar e at work adapting the “ planetary matter “ to the new and greater concept of life and evolutio n being brough t through. W hen The Christ u sing the body of Jesus of Nazareth, strongly influenced the planet Earth there were ver y definite though perhaps inc alculable changes in the actual lines of the Earth: these were no t observable by science perhaps but the Logoidal F orces ch anged to another course s o to speak and the inner forces behind the outer manifestation of the Earth - the etheric struct ure - began to alter. Form is not confined to outline but is essentially the whole s hape and fills the need of Life for a particular sh ape: the shape does not appear all a t once but grows and develops in the course of evolutio n, as indeed does the life. The actual outlines or configurations of Cosmic f orm such as the stars, planets, and large land masses are all i nfluenced by the Lords of Form. The ancients were aware o f these very early beings (th e Lords of Form) and their powers, rec ognizing them as great Titanic Forces much connected with fi re and metallic ores and paying homage to them in some of the earliest Mysteries. These Lords are behind the great c hemical (an d alchemical) fires. They construct shape by me ans of mingling and uniting th e Elemental Powers an d the metallic an d mineral forces of the Earth -building struct ures of every kind especially planetary structures for they it was who built the planets. You will notice that the larger and vaster f orms are always the simplest- the great spherical f orms are the simplest but smaller types increase in complexity, a comparison of the huge prehistoric animals with the present-day f auna will show. The ” outer “ structure of a planet is indeed simple. The Lords of Form may also be called the ”Lords o f Rhythm “ (just as the Lords of Flame may b e called the ” Lords of Vibration “) because of their rhythmical adva nce and retreat in the building o f the universe. That was the beginning of rhythm in the universe a nd it set the grea t rhythms ” De ath “ and “ Birth.” Thus can these Lords be called the ” Lords of Death “ and they are deeply connected with t he Ring- Chaos; they have the great driving force of reaction that will finally break up a form and release the force. They are at work behind the construc tion of mineral forms for these are after-develop ments of the form of the Earth and the life of the planet is within the mineral in a certain way. All the ancient legends of the great Powers of the Underworld -the chthonic Forc es of Hammer and Anvil, the hammering into shape of great s treams of force, the Blacksmith Gods, deal with the Builders and lesser types of Elemental beings co ncerned with work as servants of the Lords of Form. In a properly worked ritual the Elemental beings build certain forms on the astral which ho ld together the stress es of force until other forces take over: rhythm or repetition is important here for the frequent building of the forms eventually makes it as near “ solid “ as is possible on the astral plane. Just as the efficient and “ contacted “ occultist m akes use of the service and cooperation of these Builders s o, on a much larger scale,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"did the Logos use the powers o f the Lords of Form to construct not only the Earth but also the other planets of Its system. All the solar system is interlinke d and reflections of the attributes of other planets will be seen-within certain mineral forms of the Earth - cert ain precious s tones, for instance, are very closely connected with ot her planets and this connection is not based only on superstition. Similarly certain metals have a composition which links th em to certain basic outlines a nd substances of other planets giving not only an analogy with them but also a certain definite linking. An imaginative picture of these great Lords of Form could be made by visualising a vast amphitheatre under the earth in darkness filled with red flashes from the depths of inner earth. Through this dark ness can be heard a hammer on an anvil-very faintly at first for it is ver y remote. Imagine this sound as coming gradu ally nearer with a tremendous rhyth m, hard, strong, simple. A’s that rhyth mic sound increas es in in tensity giant forms grad ually begin to build in outline-vast f orms dimly and only partly seen in outline for they are too huge and to6 strong to be contained in space as we know it; feel the etheric intensification “ behind “ the dimly discern ed form. Within this work which is b eing done by the Lords of Form is a vast patience which is c ontent to take millions of years over the task it has set itself so that it can be perfectly done. Every time the Great Worker returns to a task he brings a new power derived from the Logos and from the Sphere in which h e accomplishe d his last work, and this new power gi ves a s omewhat changed type o f force to the work. And ever the great h ammer beats and beats and beats through Time - building, un building and building again: such are the grea t Regents of the Logos entrusted with this work. These Regents are also the servers of the Aspect of the Logos b6hind death, and regeneration and rebuilding. We can invoke t he Lords of Form to help us to earn our freedom from form when the time approaches. He who kn ows and understands death has already overcome it-he is a pupil of the Lords of Form. W e would do well to give a thought to the great Builders who h ave built us and the planetary spheres and who are behind the laws of shape whether on the astral or p hysical plane, with whom we can cooperate as agents of the Divine. (18) In The Mystical Q abalah there are references to the Archangels of the Ten Holy Sephiroth. These are the “ Intelligences of the Spheres and are of the First Swarm-L ords of Flame. That Intelligence works with the archetypal f orce of the Sphere and under its co ntrol ar e the “ Angels o f the Sphere “ which exec ute the wishes o f the Archangels a ccording to their natures. The Sphere of Malkuth comprises the mundane plane and the spiritual values which are immediately within d ense matter - in fact the “ Spirit o f the Atom and it is u nder the aegis of the Lord of the Four El ements we call Sandalphon. This Archangel is one to be invoked by those especially who find difficulty in coming t o grips with t he physical plane, for it is he who h as charge o f the “soul” of physical o bjects. If you could see with your physical v ision the exact i nner plane condition of a chair or a table you would ob serve a very slow vibration and movement of infinite numbers of tiny ” molecules “ ho lding toge ther the dense matter. Sandalphon is the Overlord of all these activities.

The Sphere of Yesod concerns a mong other things th e deeper and remoter etheric su bstance - the Akasha as it is sometimes calle d - and here the Archangel is that known as Gabriel, ruler of many subtle realms in n ature and in man. He is t he Lord of Dreams and of the subtle vibrations of a rare kind which ca n touch the clairvoyant faculties o f man. In Christianity he is associated with the Annunciation partly because he is ” The Mystic Announcer “- the controller o f a special ki nd of message which can reach to the human mind from far-off planes; he is, in fact, the Angel of Annunciation to many others than Mary. Thus he is also concerned with sle ep-that condition in which the dense body is inactive and the subtle vehicles ca n escape from it to other planes. It is a large part of his work to induce what is a part of “the Moon Conscious ness” in man; he tends to draw the soul magnetically even as a great water power draws and therefore his influence is a kind of sedative on the physical p ower - he draws the consciousness from it. He may be pictured as a huge ovoid of silvery substance with the delicate lilac a nd violet of Yesod in his “ wings “ and the sound of mighty waters which s how his special type of vibratio n. The Sphere of Tiphareth is presided over by th e Archangel Raphael. He holds the healing a nd sustaining powers o f sunlight - especially is he concerned with the modem methods of radiant heat and infra-red a nd ultra-violet rays, though these are as yet from the esoteric sta ndpoint only in their infancy. Finally, there is the Sphere of Kether whose Archangel is Metatron. He is said to have been responsible for the glyph of the Tree of Life’s being given to man. He works in t he great world of Cosmic Archetypes, and his influence is ver y rare. It is of the type that comes as a blinding fl ash of illumin ation of remote spiritual truths. Thus far we have dealt with t he Sephiroth on the Middle Pillar of the composite gl yph of the Tree of Life and the Pillars. Let us now consider the Sephiroth on the two Side Pillars. The Archangel o f the Sphere of Chokmah is Ra tziel - He brought through t he creative forces in early evolutio n. It is difficult to formulate in the human mind such beings as either Metatron (of Kether) or Ratziel, for they are beyond form as we kn ow it and are incapable of being ”reduced” to a symb ol in any way adequate save per haps that of great ”Pillars of Glory” with no fixed outlines. The Archangel o f the Sphere of Binah - Tzaphkiel - has been behind the formulation of all the mystic cults that have been sent down fr om time to time by the Inner Pla ne Adepti. He is the ”Archangel o f the Temple” and can be envisaged as a vast Presence shining with a certain living darkness with a rose- coloured glow in the centre. The Archangel o f Chesed - Tzadkiel - ha s a great influence giving an assurance of benevolence and the utter calm of eternal security and certainty. He could be of great help to any who are prone to irritation or unbalance of temper. The Archangel o f Geburah - Khamael - is t he Protector of the weak a nd wronged ; he is also the Avenging Angel who p unishes the breakers of Law The Archangel o f Netzach - Ha niel, - is t he Archangel o f the Sphere of harmony and beauty, and especially of inter- relationships whet her of Spheres, planets, plants or animal and"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"human life: the great archetype o f sympathetic vib ration.

The ancient Jews listed whole choirs of angels by name in addition to the great beings here enumerated, and to deal with them would require m uch time; but you have s ome indications about ten so grea t that they are - each in his own Sphere - in charge o f the mighty Emanations of God.

(19) The teachinig on the Ray Exemplars - es pecially contained in Chapter XX - is of great importance and should be carefully meditated upon. The teaching has been given in a very condensed form - largely owing to the abstruse and difficult nature of the subject which made it very difficult to put the ideas into adequate expression in language. A good way to obtain an understanding is to think of the great Teachers an d Redeemers of mankind who h ave guide d the various p hases of evolution in all conditions - both Cosmic and mundane. Think of the mighty influences and ”conditions” that pour through t he great currents of force marked by the Zodiacs - t he Greater Zodiac of the Rays, and the better - kn own Lesser Zodiac. In these great currents work various types o f the Redemptive Force of the Logos, or, to use a more Cosmic phr ase, the great Cosmic Force f uses in a special wa y on a special occasion with what might b e called the central as pect of the Logos in order the better to influence evolu tion. As the different types o f this great F orce touch our own evolutio n they give off to each one a definite influence - they act as nourishers, hel pers, feeders of that particular Di vine Spark. So it has always been in every phase of our evoluti on. The Being of whom we kn ow most is he who is s ometimes called ”The Lord of the Purple Ray.” He is, so to speak, the “group- mind “ of that Ray - a great grou p-mind which is at the super- phase in which it leads on our evolutio n to its conclusio n. The tremendous force of which I speak - the “Anointed Force” o f the Purple R ay - has focused to some extent from time to time in some great Guide or Leader who h as come down in to the world of men, but the Lord of the Purple R ay is, of course, unique. The intricacy of the subject m akes it nearly impossi ble to give a clear exp osition in words alone; words should be combined with deep contemplation and concentration rather than with only intellectual meditation to gain some begin ning of understanding which w ill continue to grow. The names and attributes traditionally given to the Ray Exemplars are of high importance, not only because they give some idea of the Being through whom the force focused in this world, but because they can put you in touch with a Cosmic power which excee ds the force of the Ray shown when their bearers were in the world. There is, naturally, a difference. between the “ Cos mic Christ “ and the Force o f the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Cosmic Christ f ocused in an individual, but the latter proceeds from the former an d could not manifest witho ut it. The forces of the Ray Exem plars are very strong and very deep. It can be of great valu e to link them mentally with those more abstract aspects of the individual c alled variously in esotericism the “ Higher Self “ or the Individuality. It is possible in suitably prepared conditions for this grea t Force to be contacted in ritual but great c are is n eeded as it can have a destructive effect in “ burning up the dross “ i f it is brought too near the earth-plane. Norm ally in ritualistic conditions it acts - to use the symbolism o f the Qabalistic Tree of Life - from the Supernal Triangle t hrough Tiphareth and does not come “ below “ that Sephirah but on occasion it may work through t o the astral a nd etheric levels using a group of people as a basis o f manifestation and bringing about repercussio ns whereby all in that group would be affected sinc e none could be in contact with such a Force and remain unaffected. The great ”Ray” impinges on the Higher S elf in such a manner as to impel it towards int egration with th e Personality, and everyone save those whose i ntegratio n was well advanced would f eel strong effects which might well be beyond their capacity at that stage to support. When this “ Ray “ is brought through the Personality has to absorb in a way the experienc e of the Higher S elf even as the Higher Self has to absorb the experiences of the Personality after physical death.This power o f the Cosmic Christ c an be thought of as that of the higher planes of ”the Sun-behind-the-sun” which so to speak unites the Ray with the Logos. The time has now come whe n the great Force a s a whole will no longer focus in a single b eing but in a group - ever w idening until it takes in the whole world. The inner plane ”body” now used by the Force c an be thought of as something like the highes t esoteric c onception of Horus. Neverthel ess the beings in who m the Force once manifested individually still work in remote planes and maintain in the Cosmos the distinctive power with which they once worked on earth. It is sometimes liable to cause confusion if a ”Ray” is associat ed with a special colo ur. The ” Ray ” of the Cosmic Christ is t hat of the Oversoul o f the Lords of Mind. It works through t he precessional Signs o f the Zodiac and contains within itself a whole spectrum or a set of strata of colours of which strata the so-calle d “Purpl e Ray” is a stratum. The Green Ray or green stratum of the same great Ray worked t hrough the force describe d in the legends of Osiris, Orpheus and Dionysos. I t is the true Ray -of Mind and leads to the innermost sanctuaries o f the “ Mysteries.” (20) Man’s primal l oyalty is to the One-Unity . “Loyalty” is hardly the correct word to use as the One is a Law-no other type o f existence is p ossible ; in It we live and move and have our being. It is, however, very necessary to understand that the One - the Logos - is a ctually the becoming manifest of the Unmanifest; It is Unity not because It is concentrated or limited but because It is undifferentiated. The nucleus of the being of each immortal so ul is a “nucleus of energy” in the Unmanifest. The Logos provides t he ordered substance of manifestation on all planes whenc e we build up the vehicles o f manifestation on each plane. Therefore is our manifested existe nce conditioned thereby, the Logoidal n ature being the law of existe nce to which we mu st submit if we would live harmoniously in manifestafion. The nucleus of each living"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"soul does not derive its existe nce from the Logoidal Being but from the Unmanifest Itself. However, as man manifests forth in the sphere of the Solar Logos m an must work in and through its conditions which ar e the laws of the Logoidal nature. The Solar Logos is t he God of the Solar System and gives it its laws; this Logos, workin g through t he Planetary Beings and their Archangelic G uides is the source of the differentiated energy manifesting within th e bounds of the solar n ebula. In brief, the Solar Logos is th e Conditioner and Sustainer of manifestation in Its universe: the Great Unmanifest is unconditioned. (2I) There are three titles which might be confusing un less a clear idea of the way in which they are used has been gaine d. They are (1) the Planetary Entity, (2) the Planetary Intelligence or the Archangelic I ntelligence , (3) the Planetary Being. The Planetary Entity is the Logoidal Idea of the “ planet “ as it is to become in its spiritual s ense at the end of evolution. The concept of this has many symbolic de scriptions , such as “The Kingdom ... .. The New Jerusalem,” etc. The Planetary Intelligence or the Archangelic Intelligence is the Archangel a ppointed to guide the ”planet” during its evolution; that Archangel is on e of the First Swarm . That assigned to earth is known in t he West as Sandalphon. He is s aid to have first come into close c ontrol of earth during the Lemurian Period when Fire was in a particular ma nner being introduced into earth. This Archangel, grea t as he is, is said to be not quite of the stature of the Planetary Intelligence of Venus or Mercury ; from our present viewpoint , howeve r, his greatness is s uch that the distinctio n to us is largely academic. He, too, is develo ping and reaching ou t, so to speak, towards another great Force-and this concept is indicated in certain e soteric allegories de aling with the symbolism o f marriages. Fro m time to time great entities from other and more developed ”planets” have been in touch with Sandalphon’s planetary work, especially from the planet Venus. The Planetary Being is as it were a vast Ele mental composed of the consciousness (using th e word in a wide se nse) of each one of its children-th e children b eing all t he lives upon the earth, humans, beasts, birds, reptiles , fish, insects, etc. In the great Elemental, the Planetary Being, all these are, or should be, one:and so they are, or should be, one in their relationship to each other; it is because that relationship h as been shaken, broken and betrayed that so many ills have come to pass. It can be assumed that when “the Kingd om comes,” when t he Logoidal Idea of this planet is truly manifested then indeed all earth- creatures will be one on a certain level. All should remember that as developed and developing hu man beings th ey have a grea t debt to the earth who is in very truth their mo ther, their parent; they are made of her substance and live upon her substance and all that they do here on earth, all that they discover in science, all that they make in art or industry are also parts of her. But she develops less quickly than her children and it is the duty of the children by their development to aid hers. Therefore, whatso ever you d o let it be not only for your own gain or in terest but also for the gain and keen interest of the Planetary Being. The more that you do that is consciously shared with this vast E lemental parent the more will those things pros per not only in her but in you. There is no thing on earth, no thought b rought through to earth which does not concern the Planetary Being - however great or lofty,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"however (un fortunately) mean or base. You have a very great responsibility not only to yourselves an d to each othetr but also to the great group-soul of the earth, the great mass-mo ther of you all.

Be mindful, too, in thinking o f the Planetary Being to think also of all other stages o f life upon her - birds , beasts, insects, Elementals and all forms of life for to these do you bear relationship. There has been much superstitio n and sentimentality connected with this Div ine Law o f Unity but keep well in mind the grea t truth of the interrelati onship of all when you shed the superstition .
