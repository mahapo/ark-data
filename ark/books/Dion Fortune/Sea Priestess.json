I once had the entertaining experie nce o f receiving one of my own books f or review, but if I were called u pon to rev iew this on e, I should find it difficult to know how to set about it. It is a book with an undercurrent; upon the surface, a romance; underneath, a thesis upon the theme: \"All wome n are Isis, and Isis is all wome n,\" or in the language o f modern psychology , the anima-animus princi ple. Various criticisms have b een levelled at it by those who h ave rea d it in manuscrip t, and as they will probably be repeated by th ose who read it in pri nt, I may a s we ll take the opportunity of a preface to deal with them, especiall y as there is no producti on-ma nager t o say to me: \"You must cut fifty pages i f we are to get it o ut at seven-an d-six.\" It was said by a reviewer of one of my previous bo oks t hat it is a pity I make my charac ters so unlikea ble. This was a great surprise to me, for it had never occ urred t o me that my characters were unlik eable. What kind of barber's bl ocks are required in order t hat readers m ay love them ? In real li fe no one escap es the faults of their qualities, s o wh y should they in fiction ? There ar e many drawbacks t o my her o as a s on, a brother, a husband and a business par tner, and he makes n o attempt to minimis e them; nevert heless I retain my a ffection for him , though I am quit e alive to the fact that he could no t compete with the crea tions of the late Sa muel Smiles. But then I do not know that I particul arly want him to. It has often seemed to me that as one cannot please everybody , one may as well please oneself, especi ally as I have. God be thanked, n o publisher t o consider , who would n aturally expect my b ook to contribut e its qu ota towards his overh ead expe nses a nd errors o f judgm ent. It was said o f this bo ok by a publisher's re ader, who o ught t o know what he is talking ab out, that the style is u neven , risin g to heights o f lyric beauty (his expression, not mine), a nd on the same page d esce nding t o colloquialisms . This raises a pretty point in technique . My story is wr itten in the first p erson; it is t herefore a onologue, a nd the same rule a pplies to it that applies to dialogue-- that the speak ers must speak in character . As my her o's mo od changes, his narr ative style th erefore changes. Any writer wi ll agree t hat narra tive in t he first pers on is a most difficult technique t o handle. The method of pres entation is in a ctuality that of drama, though ma intaining th e appearance o f narrative; mor eover everything ha s to be seen not only through th e eyes, b ut through t he temperament of the perso n who is t elling the story. A restraint h as to be observed in the emotional pa ssages les t the blight o f self-pity appear o n the hero. He m ust, at all c osts, k eep he reader's respec t while evoking his sympathy, and this he cannot do if he wallo ws in his emotions . Conseque ntly in t he most telling scenes , where an author would n ormally pull ou t the tremolo st op and tread on the loud pedal, only curt, b rief Anglo-Saxon may be used, for no one employs el aborate E nglish when in extremis. All effects have to be obtained by \"n oises off\". Therefore unless t he reader ha s imagination and can re ad cons tructi vely, the effects ar e lost . And this bri ngs m e to the questio n of constructive rea ding. Everybod y knows how much the audience contribut es to the performanc e of a play, but few people re alise how mu ch a reader must co ntribu te to the effect of a work of fiction. Perhaps I ask t oo much of my re aders: that is a point I am not competent to judge, and can only say with Martin Luther: \"God help me , I can do no otherwise.\" After all, t he style is t he man, and short o f castratio n, cannot b e altere d. And who wants to be a literar y eunuch? N ot me, anyway, which is perhaps t he reaso n wh y I have to do my own publishing. People re ad fiction i n ord er to supplement the diet life provides f or them. If life is f ull and var ied, they like novels t hat analyse a nd interpret it for them; if life is narr ow and unsatisfying, they supply themselves with ma ss pr oduction wish- fulfilments from the lending libraries. I have managed to fit my bo ok in between these two sto ols so neatly that it is har dly fair to say that it falls between them. It is a novel o f interpret ation and a novel o f wish-fulfilment at the same tim e. Yet after all, why should n ot the two be combined? They have to be in psycho-t herapy, where I learnt my tr ade.
