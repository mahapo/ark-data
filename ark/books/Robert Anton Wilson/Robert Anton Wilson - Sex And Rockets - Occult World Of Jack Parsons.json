He acted as scientist, as occultist, aspolitical dissident and often as a simple damned eejit (just lik e you and me).Scientists, a ware of his tr emendous contributions to space science , generallycall him John Parsons, and they’ve even named a crater on the moon after him.Those occultists who know of his work in their very specialized arts call himJack P arsons, the name he himself pr eferred; in some magick lodges the yconsider him second only to Aleister Cr owley as a pr ogenitor of the Ne w Aeon.His best-kno wn book, Freedom Is A Two-Edged Swor d, which incr easinglyinfluences the libertarian and anarchist movements, gives his name as JohnWhiteside P arsons on the cover and title page. And, as the present biographydocuments, this odd bird actually had the legal name Marv el Whiteside Parsonsimposed on him at birth.Oh, well, if my parents had named me “Marv el,” I w ould have changed my name,too, perhaps as often as Parsons did.For utmost scientific clarity about matter s usually left in m ystic murk orpsychobabble, I shall use all four of Our Hero’s names: John Parsons for thescientist, John Whiteside P arsons for the libertarian philosopher, Jack Parsons for the occultist, and Marv el Parsons for the original template: analienated and sometimes naiv e boy, a child of divorce, who tried to find andliberate what occultists call his True Self by creating the other threeParsonspersons and permitting them to fight brutal wars in the loneliness of hispassionate br ain until all three became One. When endured helplessly by a trulyfractured personality, w e gener ally call this civil w ar in the ps ycheMultiple Personality Disor der: when deliber ately pur sued as a path ofIllumination leading through Hell and Purgatory toward a vision (at least) ofParadise, we have no name for it in our curr ent culture but those few who, like Parsons, have taken the hermetic oath to Will and Dar e and Kno w and K eepSilence simply call it magick (pr onounced mage-ick, as in the Three Magi).Marvel Parsons, born in 1914 in Los Angeles but r aised mostly in the nearb y town of P asadena, began life lik e all of us in what Tibetans call the V oid andthe Chinese call wu-hsin (no mind). Gradually, out of the V oid, form emer ged.He made the distinction between Marv el and Ev erything Else; a glass w all thensepar ated Marvel from Everything Else. He gradually identified various parts ofEverything Else, as soon as he learned their names.Fatherless, Marvel had a conserv ative middle class mother who loved him a bittoo ar dently (she committed suicide within a fe w hours after his death, 17June 1952). She also taught him to hate his absent father, a pr oven “adulterer.” (Horrors!) Developing an early interest in psychology, Marveldiagnosed himself as having a classic Oedipus complex, a compulsiv e antipathyto “P atriarchy” (he used the word before the Feminists made it trendy) and anequally intense loathing for an y and all A uthority s ymbols, especially “Godthe Father.”But let us look at 19 14, the year of Parsons’ birth, more closely. Whatever youthink of astrology, with its extraterrestrial bias, a “secular horoscope”limited to Earthly portents always provides amusing insights. The terrestrialworld that shaped Marvel Parsons looked like this:The First World War had started on July 28 that year; before 1914 ended the first aerial bombing of civilian populations occurr ed (Germany did it to F rance),and the bloody battles of the Marne , Tannerberg, Ghent and especially Ypresdemonstrated that “civilized” modern humans could act even more inhumanely andinsanely than any barbarians of the past.Police arr ested the legendary labor her o Joe Hill in Utah on January 13 for amurder he almost certainly did not commit, and the State executed him the following year. His last w ords, “Don’t w eep for me , bo ys—organize!” became amantr a to union member s for decades after.In Colorado, John D. R ockefeller’s hired goons killed 2 1 people (including 11children) in a clash with other labor “radicals.” Leftists protested outside Rockefeller’s New York office and got arr ested for it: a court order banned anyother people with signs or banners from parading in fr ont of that sacr osanctshrine of the Almighty Dollar . Novelist Upton Sinclair appear ed the ne xt da ywith a blank sign, telling reporters that free speech had died. Suffr agettesmarched on Washington June 28, demanding equal rights for w omen.In England, Dubliners, the fir st book b y an Irish author named James Jo yce,appear ed; and in America Edgar Rice Burr oughs brought forth Tarzan of The Apes. Musically, w e all acquir ed three major treasures, “The Colonel Boge y March,” “Saint Louis Blues” and “12th Str eet R ag.” In film, D.W . Griffith’ s TheMother and the Law rawly showed the abuse of women by “the Patriarchy.”Margaret Sanger intr oduced the term “birth contr ol” in The Woman Rebel andthen fled to England to avoid imprisonment for the “crime” of publishingexplicit details on contraception.Charles T aze R ussell, founder of the Jeho vah’s Witnesses , announced that theapocalypse w ould begin on October 2—coincidentally or synchronistically, thevery day Marvel Whiteside Parsons [who w ould later , as Jack Parsons, callhimself the AntiChrist] emerged from his mother’ s womb, or from even darkerplaces, and began to investigate and meddle with this planet.Going back to England again: also in 19 14, Aleister Cr owley (rhymes with“holy”) and his curr ent mistr ess, violinist Leila Waddell, staged somethingcalled “The Rites of Eleusis” in London—several nights of quasi-masonic ritual,music, poetry, ballet and drama. On the first night, the actors informed theaudience, Nietzsche-fashion, that “God is dead” and mourned and grie ved overthe departed deity: things became even stranger after that, like the bardos inthe Tibetan Book of the Dead , and on the last night the audience received “TheElixir of the Gods,” a wine containing a high dosage of the ps ychedelic drugmescaline . While the y willynilly enter ed Chaos and the V oid a chorusannounced the dawning of a New Aeon based on R abelais’ Law of Thelema—“Do WhatThou Wilt” . . .And Doublemint chewing gum appeared on the market, produced by William Wrigley .. .All of this undeniably influenced Marv el as much as , or mor e than, an ydistant star s or planets . The horr ors of W orld W ar imprinted him with awounded perception of the dark side of “human nature”: some parts of Freedom IsA Two-Edged Sword sound as bitter as S wift or Twain at their most misanthropic. Marvel also acquired a genuine sympathy for working people, and anawareness of the brute for ce behind Capitalism and Capitalist Go vernmentsnever left him: although an ultr a-individualist himself. he had mor e than oneMarxist friend (which got him virtually tarred and feathered during the McCarthyera).Standing there as big as lifeAnd smiling with those eyes:“What they forgot to kill,” said Joe“Went on to organize.”Margaret Sanger and the suffr agettes also left a mark: no male writer sinceJohn Stuart Mill in the 19th Century has sho wn more empathy for Feminism thanJohn Whiteside Parsons.“Saint Louis Blues” helped cr eate the Jazz A ge in which Marv el began toevolve from boy to man. And, like Russell and the Jehovah’s Witnesses, he grewup convinced that the w orld had entered a life-and-death battle between Cosmic(or at least Archetypal) Forces—but he enlisted on the side of the rebels, sincehe hated what we now call the logophallocentrism of “God the F ather” even morethan our current crop of Feminist theologians do. Although (as noted) he couldsee the Oedipal roots of this bias, he also perceived/conceived it as a decisionfor Light and Liberty against Tyranny and Superstition.Aleister Crowley and his New Aeon would later transform Marvel into JackParsons.I don’t know how Wrigley’s Doublemint gum fits into this list of terrestrialSigns and Omens surr ounding the genesis of Marv el Parsons. But I feel suresome student of Crowleyana will write to me and explain it after this bookappears.Then another major influence mutated Marv el Parsons into John Parsons and JohnWhiteside P arsons and Jack P arsons: in his teens he disco vered a despised anddisr eputable genr e of pulp liter ature confusingly known (at the time) aseither science-fiction or science-fantasy. Seen from the present, the sci-ficrowd of that age look lik e closet surrealists who had re-invented the Novel OfIdeas and tailored it for magazines with names lik e Thrilling Wonder Tales. Theuncertainty about what to call their product typified the age of acceleratedchange in which Parsons and this literature both matured: after Jules Verne’s“fantas y” submarine appear ed in the w orld’s r eal seas , nobody with morebrain cells than a chimpanzee or a Fundamentalist felt totally secur e about thediffer ences betw een the pr obable, the improbable and the totally impossible.If V erne’s submarine could become materialized, wh y not his rocket to themoon? The question excited a lot of other boys besides Marvel Parsons: but,unlike most of them, he did something about it. He became John Parsons, almostcertainly (as this book documents) the one single individual who contributed themost to rocket science. Two of the institutions he helped or ganize, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at P asadena and the A erojet Corporation, still play largeroles in space exploration.You will learn mor e about John Parsons’ acknowledged scientific achievements inthe text to follow: I will concentrate on his other, still controversial labors. Just r emember that when he started building rockets they seemed as “w acko”to most people as an ything else he did. Y et his car eful scientific experiments and theories liber ated humanity from Terracentrism and showed us thepath to a starry destiny.Rocket engineer John Parsons also became friendly with the leading “fantasy” and“sci-fi” writer s in the Los Angeles/P asadena area and entered a subculture inwhich no idea seemed too cr azy to discuss: a world where established science,fringe science, pseudo-science, philosophic speculation and visionaryimagination all r an wild—in short, a world which anticipated and helpedgenerate most of the “w eird and k ooky” ideas which ha ve no w infiltr ated every aspect of our cultur e, e xcept for the most r eactionary Stone A geenclaves of Mississippi and the U.S. Congress.It did not require much of a jump, then or now, to move from theFuturist-Fantasist w orld into Se x, Drugs and Magick. If y ou r eally enjoyedthe Star Trek and Star Wars movies; or if y ou ever, even in fun, told a friend“Live long and prosper” or “May the Force be with you”; or pla yed Dungeons andDr agons, smoked a joint no w and again, participated to an y degree in the Ne wAge and/or the Neo-Pagan r evival—two popularized (diluted) aspects of Crowley’s New Aeon—or e ven if y ou e ver w anted to get the go vernment off ourfronts (sexual freedom) as well as off our backs (market freedom)—you havereceived part of the huge legac y of Jack P arsons and his merry crew of sciencebuffs, sorcerers and subversives.Look at it this w ay: in John P arsons’ 193 0s-1940s sci-fantas y world,everybody he knew had already started discussing the possible “humanity” and“human rights” of e xtraterrestrials and r obots; they created alternatesocieties much more rational and adventurous than most “normal” people of thattime could possibly imagine; they assumed (partly due to the influence of AlfredKorzybski and General Semantics) that information and technology would furtheraccelerate their synergetic accelerations even faster than they had in the previous century (Parsons’ friend, sci-fi-psi author A.E. van Vogt had studiedwith K orzybski per sonally); the y cr eated Alternative Worlds where anythingcurrently considered goofy—from new economic systems to long-suppr essed Gnosticdoctrines—might function as efficiently as the pencil sharpener.Robert Anson Heinlein, another friend of P arsons, wrote a novel, Waldo, inwhich all the arts of magick ha ve not only w on scientific acceptance but havebecome technologies used daily by everybody. Heinlein also wrote, a bit later,Stranger In A Strange Land, the first sci-fi novel to reach the New York Timesbestseller list, and some still say Jack P arsons’ magick/libertarian ideaspermeate e very page of it—pax, Mr. Carter!To leave the heady and trippy environment of chaps like van Vogt and Heinlein,and to encounter and endure the Official Reality of the U.S. of those daysprobably seemed to Parsons like time travel back to the Dark Ages.In that Official Reality, Christian piety and Capitalist predation coexisted asequally sacr ed Idols, even though the y totally contr adict each other.Stupidity, superstition and intoler ance imprisoned most Americans in medie valsqualor, both mental and economic: man y humans did not ha ve the “humanity” or“human rights” that Parsons’ friends would grant to technically sophisticatedrobots (e.g. all those humans who had dark er complexions than Sno w Whiteranked as non or-sub-human in popular opinion and in law. We actually fought awar against fascism with a racially segregated army.) Almost all r ational oradv enturous ideas encounter ed blind bigotry and often violent per secution;contr aception, div orce and abortion still remained illegal either locally orfeder ally; homose xuality and bisexuality did not exist, or at least nobody inthe major media could admit that they did exist; sex in general seemed so“dirty” that in the films of that time e ven married couples slept in separ atebeds, lest anyone suspect that the y might occasionally fuck each other; all ofthe other delights of lo ve enjoyed by most spouses r emained illegal withpenalties r anging as high as 2 0 years imprisonment; r eligious nutcasessimilar to F alwell and R obertson not only peddled hatr ed and intolerance to agullible public , but nobody dar ed to fight back or even make cynical jokesabout them; when the first scientific report on human sexuality appeared, itsauthor, Dr. Alfred Kinsey, got hit with everything but flyingmonkey-shit—according to his research associate, Dr . P omeroy, Kinse yliterally died pr ematurely from the abuse he suffered.Of course, irrational fear and superstition still stalk this nation; but inthose days, they totally dominated it.Parsons could only conclude that Americans, who claimed to love freedom,actually fear ed it, hated it and w anted to smother it with more and moretyrannical laws. They had willingly surrendered their liberty to “lying priests, conniving judges, blackmailing police” and other servitors of tyranny, as hewrote in 1946.But John Parsons, jet propulsion pioneer, had by then become Jack Parsons, sex-magician—after he disco vered and joined the Or do Templi Orientis.The Ordo Templi Orientis alleges that it descends directly from the 18th CenturyIlluminati of Ba varia. Let us look into that for a moment.WHO PUT THE LIGHT IN EN-LIGHT-ENMENT?“I need not add that fr eedom is a dangerous thing. But it is har dly possiblethat we are all cowards.”—John Whiteside Parsons 2 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-2] Amid endless controversy about them, all agree that the Bavarian Illuminatibegan on May 1, 1776, in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, created by a Freemason (and formerJesuit) named A dam Weishaupt. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica , theIlluminati managed to influence many masonic lodges and gained “ a commandingposition” in the movement of anti-r oyalist, anti-P apist and pr o-democratic“secular humanism.” They attracted such literary men as Goethe and Her der butthe whole movement came to an end when the Bavarian government banned theIlluminati in 1785. So says the standard reference.Many conspiracy hunters have more faith in the decidedly par anoid Memoirs OfJacobinism of Abbe Augustin Barruel, who believed that the Illuminati mer elyregrouped under other fr ont names after 1785, masterminded the F renchRevolution and still continued until the time he wr ote (1806). Modernanti-Illuminists think it still continues toda y, although the y often disagr eeas to whether the Illuminati r eally pr omotes secular humanism. Most Fundamtalists think the y do, but other s with liv elier fantasies suspect themof unleashing Jazz, R ock ‘n’ R oll, communism, fascism, anar chism, Satanism,international banking, ritual child abuse , or some combination thereof.According to masonic historian Albert G. Mack ey, the Illuminati at its peak hadonly 2000 members in masonic lodges in France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, P oland, Hungary , and Italy . Mack ey emphasizes that Bar on Knigge, oneof the most po werful and activ e members of the Illuminati, remained a devoutChristian all his life and would not have worked so har d for the or der if it really intended, as Abbe Barruel and others claim, the abolition of Christianity.A ne w Or der of the Illuminati appear ed in 1880, founded by Freemasonicdruggist Theodor R euss in Munich. In 1896 R euss, and fellow occultists LeopoldEngel and F ranz Hartmann co-founded the Theosophical Society of Germany, and in1901 Engel and R euss produced or for ged a charter giving them authority o verthe r e-established Illuminati of W eishaupt. In 190 1, R euss, Hartmann andmetallurgist Karl Kellner founded the Ordo Templi Orientis and about 1912 Reussconferred the 9th degree of the Ordo Templi Orientis upon Aleister Cr owley,claiming that Cr owley alr eady kne w the occult secret of that degr ee. (Crowley—rhymes with holy , r emember?—already possessed the 33r d degree of theScottish Rite and the 97th degree of the Order of Memphis and Mizraim.) Reusslater appointed Crowley his successor as Outer Head of the Orlo Templi Orientis.The Inner Head presumably remains invisible and unavailable to theunIlluminated. (Hint: meditate on the Zen k oan, “What w onderful magician makesthe grass green?”)Crowley includes A dam W eishaupt, the founder of the 18th Century Illuminati,among the Holy Saints in his Gnostic Catholic Mass, performed regularly in allOrdo Templi Orientis lodges. But that list of Holy Saints also includes alsosuch odd blokes as King Arthur, Mohammed, P arsifal, Buddha, R abelais, P opeAle xander Bor gia, Swinburne, Paracelsus, Sir Francis Bacon, John Dee, Goethe,Wagner, Nietzche, Simon Magus, King Ludwig II (“the mad king of Ba varia”) andpainter Paul Gauguin . . .Before dying, Crowley appointed one Karl Germer (a survivor of a Naziconcentration camp) his successor as Outer Head, but Germer himself neglected toattend to that little detail, and when he died suddenly several claimants arose.I counted 1005 competing Outer Heads at one time in the mid-1980s , myself amongthem. (I had r eceived that honor from a group of rebels against Kenneth Grant,an embattled Outer Head in London, who still calls himself the only real OuterHead. I always carry the card Grant’s disloyal opposition sent me; it says “TheBear er of This Car d is a Genuine and A uthorized Outer Head of the Or doTempli Orientis , so PLEASE treat him right” and magically/anachronistically hasthe signature of Aleister Crowley—or of a skillful forger.)Over on this side of the pond, the feder al courts have ruled that the title ofOrdo Templi Orientis belongs only and always to the guys and gals r epresentedon the W orld Wide W eb and ha ve further granted it tax-exempt status as acharitable corporation and religious entity. This gr oup descends dir ectly from the 193 0s -1940s A gape Lodge of the OTO, the one that Jack Parsons onceled.As we mentioned, Aleister Cr owley became an initiate of the OTO in 1912. Thishappened because he had published a mystic treatise and/or book of dirty jok esperversely or par adoxically entitled The Book Of Lies (F alsely So Called). TheOuter Head at that time , Theodore R euss came to Cr owley and said that, sincehe , Crowley, knew the secret of the 9th degr ee, he had to accept that r ank inthe OTO and its attendant obligations. Crowley protested that he knew no suchsecret but R euss showed him a cop y of The Book Of Lies and pointed to achapter which r evealed the gr eat secr et quite openly . Crowley looked at hisown words and “It instantly flashed upon me . The entire symbolism not only of Free Masonry but of man y other traditions blazed upon my spiritual vision . . .I under stood that I held in my hands the k ey to the futur e pr ogress ofhumanity .” 3 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-3] Crowley, of course,does not tell us which chapter contains the secet. You can spend man y happ yhour s, da ys, ma ybe e ven months or years, pouring over that cryptic volumeseeking the right chapter and the final secret.We should remember at this point that e ven before his inv olvement with the OTOAleister Crowley also received training, sometimes briefly and sometimes lastingmuch longer , in such tr aditions as Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Sufism; andwe should note that he majored in organic chemistry at Cambridge Univ ersity. Heoften reiterated his commitment to “the method of science, the aim of religion.”His work as Outer Head turned the OTO in radical new directions, both scientificand sexual.Now it gets really scary for the Fundamentalists.SEX AND DRUGS AND ROCK AND ROLL“In these experiences the ego will be totally alter ed or completely destroyedin the death that must pr ecede a rebirth into life. The ter ror, agony anddespair that accompany this process cannot be minimized.”—John Whiteside Parsons 4 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-4] Two recent books that shed some light on all these murky matters deserve someattention at this point—The Hiram Key and The Second Messiah.5[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-5] The author s of both books , Knightand Lomas , both Freemasons themselves, claim that they have received “supportand congratulations” from “hundr eds” of other masons—athough the y admit thattheir research has been greeted with hostile silence by the United Gr and Lodgeof England, one of the mor e conserv ative masonic bodies.Basically, Knight and Lomas try to pr ove that masonry not only dates back toancient Egypt—as only the most R omantic masons have hitherto claimed—but thatit also served as a major influence on “Jerusalem Christianity ,” the earliestform of the Christian faith, which St. Paul and other se x-maniacs persecutedand drove underground. When the official Romish Christianity became dominant,primordial or “Jerusalem” Christianity surviv d by hiding within various Gnostic“her esies,” Knight and Lomas sa y, and became a major force again only whenrediscovered and accepted as their own secret inner doctrine by the Knights Templar. When the T emplars were condemned by the Inquisition (13 08) the surivivors used v arious other names until emerging again as “Freemasons” in the 17thor 18th Centuries.Parts of this thesis ha ve appear ed in other books—the underground survival ofprimordial Christianity, for instance, underlies the entire argument of thefamous Holy Blood, Holy Gr ail by Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh—but Knight andLomas ha ve put the puzzle together in a more convincing way an any of theirprecursors.But what about the original Egyptian “m ystery” out of which this underground tradition emer ged? Do Knight and Lomas attempt to delve that far back and claimto find a convincing answ er?Indeed they do.The centr al masonic “m yth” of the wido w’s son, Hir am—the builder of Solomon’s temple , mur dered for r efusing to r eveal “the mason word” to threeruffians—derives from actual events in Egypt, they aver. The “mason w ord” doesnot mean a “w ord” in the usual sense but acts as coded euphemism indicating asecr et. (“Another damned secret?” I can hear y ou howl. Patience!)Every ne w phar aoh, befor e ascending the thr one, had to visit heaven andbecome accepted among the gods . Only after this otherworldly journey could thepharoah be accepted by the priests, and by himself, as one fit to fulfill thedivine , as well as political, functions of kingship, as conceiv ed in those days. This v oyage to the highest stars, where the gods live, involved a magickritual emplo ying what Knight and Lomas call a “nar cotic.” When the last pharaoh of the native dynasty refused to reveal the secrets of this ritual to the new Hyskos dynasty, they killed him in the manner of the wido w’s son. The lost “word” = the details of the Ritual of Illumination and the name of the “narcotic”used.It seems to me that Knight and Lomas have this last detail wrong, due to theirignor ance of ps ycho-pharmacology. Nar cotics do not allow you to walk amongthe stars and communicate with superhuman intelligences. They kill pain, theynumb anxiety, they knock you unconscious; and the y usually get y ou addicted:that’ s all the y do. Almost certainly, the magick potion used in the ritual didnot belong to the narcotic family but to the entheogens—the type of drugs alsocalled psychedelics. Entheogens produce “mystic” and godly e xperiences, and atleast one of them, and perhaps tw o, had widespr ead religious usage among theIndo-Eur opean peoples fr om ancient times, Amanita muscaria definitely andpsilocybin possibly, both of them members of the “magic mushr oom” group.You can easily find learned w orks supporting this interpretation of howhumanity fir st became a ware of Higher Intelligences . See espcially Pujarich’s The Sacr ed Mushr oom, Allegro’s The Sacr ed Mushroom and the Cr oss, Wasson’sSoma: Divine Mushr oom of Immortality, Wasson et al., Persephone’s Quest:Entheogens and the Origins of Religion, LeBarre’s Ghost Dance: Origins of Religion, Peter Lamborn Wilson’ s Ploughing the Clouds: The Sear ch for IrishSoma, my own Sex, Drugs and Magick—and especially see T erence McKenna’s Food ofthe Gods , which argues that all e xisting religions evolved from paleolithicrituals using entheogens and gr oup se x to achieve ego-tr anscendence andcosmic consciousness . You can still see the ancient se xual symbolism even insuch r omish ikons as the Sacred Heart and the Cr oss: the former does not looklike a heart at all but like a tumescent vagina and the latter has the shape ofa penis and testicles.Jack P arsons’ magick and John P arsons’ science ha ve a closer unity than mostpeople can imagine. They both aimed at the stars.By the w ay, all o ver northern Eur ope tr aditional art sho ws the fairy-peopleand sor cerers surrounded by mushr ooms, usually the “liberty cap” mushroom, nowidentified as psilocybin, the same used by Native American shamans for around4000 years. The Irish Gaelic name for this fabulous fungus , Pokeen, meanslittle god. (“Little fairy” in modern Gaelic , but pook derives ultimately fr ombog, the Indo-European root for “god.”)Crowley spoke for this tradition when he said true religion always invokes Dionysus, Aphrodite and the Muses , which he also called “wine, women and song.”Nowadays we call this magick trinity Se x and Drugs and Rock ‘n’ Roll, andcelebrate them at Raves that hauntingly resemble the earliest stirrings ofcosmic questing b y ancestors who dressed in animal skins and looked even morelike gorillas than we do.I have saved the worst shock to “good, decent Americans” for the end of thissection. In 1986, r esearchers found another (appr oximately) 2000-year-oldmanuscript near the same Nag Hammadi caves where the “Dead Sea Scr olls” hadcome to light. T ranslated into English by Mohammed al-Murtada and FrancisBendik under the title The Secret Book Of Judas Of K erioth, this text depictsJesus as the bisexual lo ver of both Mary Magdelene and St. John, and alsodescribes the Last Supper as an entheogenic sacr ament inv olving magicmushrooms.

It will blow the circuits of anyFundamentalists you know . . .Sort of sounds like the historical Jesus (as distinguished fr om the mythicalChrist) had a lot in common with Jack P arsons, doesn’t it?“The time to fight for fr eedom is the time when fr eedom is threatened,not the time when fr eedom is destroyed, for that later time is too late.Freedom is thr eatened now, the destr uction of fr eedom is not far of f.Now is the time to fight.”—John Whiteside Parsons 6 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-6] In every state of the Union, Fundamentalists still fight to ban all the sciencethey dislike and prosecute all who teach it. To them, “traditional familyvalues” denotes their right to k eep their children as ignorant as theirgrandparents (and to hate the same folks gr and-dad hated.)Our government’s war against “sin,” i.e. against all forms of individual tasteand whims y, currently costs the taxpa yers (federal and local) 450 billiondollars ($450,000,000,000) every year, according to Peter Mc Williams7[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-7] . This makes up the bill for allforms of government interference in people’ s private liv es—i.e. the footlessand hopeless attempt to stomp out “ consensual” or “victimless” crimes—porno,prostitution, gambling, r ecreational or r eligious use of entheogens , etc. Whodecides what consensual or victimless acts should become “crimes”? The so-calledChristians who dr ove original “Jerusalem Christianity” underground, establishedthe Holy Inquistion and still seem to suffer from what H.L. Mencken called “thehaunting fear that somebody, somewhere, might be ha ving a good time”: the“lying priests, conniving judges , blackmailing police” denounced b y JohnWhiteside Parsons in 1946. (Crowley, with his usual flair for humorousmelodrama, called them the Black Brotherhood in his books, and it took me yearsto figure out whom he meant . . .)In Ne wark, California, r ecently, police br oke into the home of a Koreanfamily, beat them all up and smashed all their furnitur e and dishes whileallegedly looking for verboten drugs. They found no drugs, but the narcsexplained to the press, “This is war.” 8[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-8]In Minneapolis , mor e tr agically, the police also br oke into the home of anelderly black couple, using flash-bang grenades which set the building on fireand killed both husband and wife . They offered the same “explanation” as inNewark: “This is war.” 9 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-9]As Oliv er Steinber g wr ote, “It is inaccur ate to speak of a W ar on Drugs . .. You don’t lock drugs up in jail, you lock up people . . . You can’t killdrugs—you kill people. Our government is not waging a war on drugs—it is waginga war on the people.” 10 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-10]Due to a strange and nefarious union of the F undamentalists and the fanaticwing of Feminism, we have had more than 60 witch-hunts or Satanic Panics since1980. Thousands of lives ruined, mass hysterias, millions of dollars wasted onprosecutions that usually collapsed in court for lack of real evidence: a largeprice to pay for the destruction of the Bill of Rights. After digging incountless “mass gr aves” of alleged victims of human sacrifice, the FBI’sBehavioral Science Unit, which deals with serial killers, found no victims atall, at all, and concluded that the whole mania had no basis in fact—which led,of course, to charges that the FBI itself functioned as part of the Satanicconspiracy.11 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-11]And none of this has an ything to do with the original Jerusalem Christianity.It emerged only from the Papist pretenders in Rome and their Protestantimitators, who make up the whole of what most people think of as “Christianity.”Nietzsche, who lived too soon to learn of that original Christianity regardedwhat passes under that label as the w orst disaster to e ver befall humanity. Ashe wrote in The Antichrist:The hatred of intellect, of pride, courage, fr eedom of intellect, is Christian;the hatred of the senses, of the delights of the senses, of all delight, isChristian . . . the concepts of “the other world,” “the last judgement,” “theimmor tality of the soul,” “soul” itself: they are torture instruments, they aresystems of cruelty by which the priests became masters. 12[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-12]Against this s ystem of cruelty Nietzsche r ebelled; and Cr owley rebelled; andJack P arsons rebelled: and because of them w e now stand on the brink of anexplosion of consciousness that literally can extend our minds and carry ourbodies to the farthest star s.“No God. No Master.”—Margaret Sanger 13 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-13] As you have gathered by now, I do not regard Parsons and Crowley as BlackMagicians or Satanists or an ything of that sort. Magick has many aspects, butprimarily it acts as a dr amatized system of “ps ychology” (or neuro-linguisticmeta-programming) to train us to break out of the cage of the sociallyconditioned ego and, b y plunging directly into the Chaos and Void from which weemerged, experience a rebirth into a ne w sense of self, of w orld, and of chaosand v oid, knowing directly, by experience, that all these names hide the samehidden unity—the w onderful magician who mak es the grass green, makes the sadman sad, mak es the angry w oman angry, and makes the loving heart overflow withfurther love endlessly.Dr. John Lilly called this pr ocess “metapr ogramming the human bio-computer”;Dr . Timothy Leary , conscious of his debts to both Crowley and Parsons, calledit “serial r e-imprinting” of our “r eality-tunnel.”As Terence McKenna often says in his lectures, you can do all this by yoga—butonly if you can spare seven years of your life, or longer, sitting around anashram meditating. Magick works faster, especially when united with the ancientshamanic ecstasies of full se xual release and the proper en-theo-gens.Crowley said, and Parsons liked to quote him on this, “THERE IS NO GOD BUT MAN.” (That sounds “se xist” these days, but y ou all kno w what he meant. He alsosaid “ EVERY MAN AND EVER Y WOMAN IS A STAR.”) To confuse this with atheismseems to me as wildly off the mark as confusing it with “Satanism.” It quitesimply means that all ideas/perceptions/experiences of the divine or theimmortal r efer directly back to the latent powers of the mind that containsthem. (In this context, see John 10:34.)As Jack Parsons knew, and as F reudians will readily see for themselves, thewhole magick al struggle in P arsons’ Babalon W orking recounted in ChaptersSeven and Eight unleashed, on one level, a violent confrontation with Marv el’sOedipus Comple x. Babalon r epresents the Mother and the Whore, the oppositearchetypes of the male mind. To say it aloud, when making love to Babalon asCameron, Jack Parsons did consciously what all men do unconsciously: he fuckedhis mother. After 2 000 years of Christian se x-hate and se x-guilt, only inthat total life-and-death battle with all inner inhibitions could he achievethat liberation which all of us seek, all of us fear, and all of us confronteventually, in the hour of our death, when w e finally don’t give a damn anymoreabout what other people think."},{"pageContent":"“Only in the irrationaland unknown directioncan we come towisdom again.” —John Parsons, letter to Cameron, 1946002 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_002_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Preface“How shall I write of the m ystery and the terror, of the wonder and pity andsplendor of the se v-enfold star that is Babalon?” I shall tell of the tr agiclife of her most devoted disciple and belo ved son—known to her as F raterBelarion, and to the world of men as Jack Parsons.In The Rebirth of P an, Jim Br andon says that “Parsons” is one of the few namesthat turns up repeatedly in reports of anomalous phenomena.

The rite failed, and just a fewyears later this same Parsons would sign an oath stating he w as the Antichrist.This man was at the same time the author of several onceclassified governmentdocuments on explosives and patented means of rocket propulsion, and the AerojetCorporation—which he personally founded—now produces solid-fuel rocket boostersfor the Space Shuttle based on his innovations.

Parsons was from the Boston area, born cir ca 1894, the son of an eggmer chant. Marvel does not appear in the Boston city dir ectories for the y ears19 10 through 1913, so he was either living at home with his parents or he wasfrom a small town just outside of Boston. When Marvel reached the age when menhave to make a living for themselves, he realized there w as no w ay he could doit selling eggs with his father . So Marvel decided to head west—to California,the land of sunshine and opportunity.Marvel arrived in Los Angeles in 19 13, a fact kno wn because his name shows upin the 1914 city directory as residing at 2375 Scarrf, where he was a tenant. Hew as employed by the English Motor Car Company of 1 132 S. Gr and A ve., which was not an imported car dealer but named for its president, P.A. English. On a1914 document, Marvel listed his occupation as ��� auto accessories,” so he wasprobably employed in sales.Parsons met Ruth Virginia Whiteside when he arrived in California and marriedher soon after . Ruth was from Ohio, but w as born in Chicago, Illinois, in late1893 or early 1894. Ruth had lived in several cities around the country and hadalso tr aveled to Europe with her parents on different occasions. I was unableto find her in any of the Los Angeles or Pasadena city directories prior to hermarriage. Marvel and Ruth Parsons gave birth to a son on October 2, 19 14 andnamed him Marvel Whiteside Parsons. He was their second child, the fir st havingdied at birth or in infanc y. The younger Marvel was born at Good SamaritanHospital, 1225 Wilshir e Blv d., Los Angeles , California, at 8:45 p.m. Theattending physician was Julian Coffey.About this time the senior Marv el did something that w as less common in 1914than it is toda y. It w as certainly less talk ed about then, and not condonedat all. Marv el had an affair with another woman. R uth r esponded to his affairb y doing something equally shocking: she divorced her new husband. Marvel canbe found in the 1915 Los Angeles city directory, living alone at 2401 Romeo St.,listed as owner of this home, where Ruth, listed as a house wife, and their sonalso lived for a while.Embittered by her ex-husband’s adulterous affair, Ruth began calling the bo y“John” r ather than “Marv el,” but she ne ver legally changed his name. As theboy grew, close friends and family w ould come to call him “Jack,” which is howhe is often remembered today. Because of these name changes , it is possible totell at a glance whether a biographical account of Parsons originates from thescientific community or the occult community as the latter uniformly calls him“Jack.” Member s of the scientific community call him “John,” which is how hewill be referred to throughout this book.Curiously, Ruth Parsons kept her ex-husband’s surname for herself and the boy,for she is consistently r eferred to as Mr s. Ruth Parsons for the rest of herlife. It may be that there was no legal divorce at all, as one of her son’ slater documents mak es reference to a “separ ation,” which ma y mean that hismother ma y ha ve mer ely kick ed Marvel out.In an ominous coincidence , Charles T aze R ussell, whose “Russellites” now callthemselves the Jeho vah’s Witnesses, predicted the end of the world would happenon October 2, 1914, the day of John Parsons’ birth, and just a couple monthsafter the start of World War I. When Russell announced to his congr egation inBrooklyn, New York, that the end had begun, he meant the finale was not aninstantaneous end to all things, but rather the beginning of the end as outlinedin the Book of Revelation—the appearance of the Antichrist and the harlot,Babylon the Gr eat, being two of the k ey events. It is ir onic that JohnParsons, who would later attempt to incarnate Babylon and who would also sign anoath stating that he was the Antichrist, was born the very day of Russell’seschatological event.Of his o wn birth, the m ystical Parsons wr ote in Analysis By A Master of theTemple 34 years later, “I chose this constellation [Libra] in order that youmight have an innate sense of balance and ultimate justice, responsive andattractive nature, a bountiful envir onment & sense of r oyalty and lar gesse,strength, courage & po wer combined with cunning and intelligence . Saturn[time] w as bound [i.e ., the planet was at aphelion] in order that you mightnot easily formulate a lower will which would have satisfied and overwhelmed youwith its spectacular success.”Parsons’ mother, Ruth, first appears in the Pasadena city directory in 1916, shown as living with her par ents, Walter H. and Carrie Whiteside at 537 S. Or angeGrove Ave., where Walter is listed as homeowner. After Marvel and Ruthseparated, Ruth’s parents apparently made the big sacrifice and mo ved west tohelp car e for their daughter and grandson. Whatever occurrence or sentimentthat had brought Ruth to California to begin with was evidently strong enough tomake her want to stay. Rather than packing up and moving home after separatingfrom Marvel, her home moved to her.South Orange Grove Avenue was known locally as “Millionair e’s Mile,” and thefamily’s presence here indicates Walter Whiteside was a successful man. Ruth’sobituary lists Walter’s occupation as president of both Ste vens Duryea and theAllis Chalmer s Manufacturing Company. Ruth and her par ents, along with y oungJohn, sta yed at 537 S. Orange Grove for a number of years. Ironically, JohnParsons’ life would end 37 y ears later just blocks fr om the very place wherehe grew up, at 1071 S. Orange Grove. The path he took to get ther e was a veryinteresting one, as we shall see.John’s father, Marvel H. Parsons, drops out of sight after 1915 and does notappear in an y of the Los Angeles or P asadena city directories again. W e dokno w that he joined the arm y, and though it is thought that he did so afterWorld War I ended in No vember 1918, the Department of V eterans Affair s has ar ecord of a Marv el H. Parsons who enlisted in August 1917, one year before thewar ended. This is the only Marv el Parsons in the VA’s files. The army seems anatural refuge for a former salesman who had lost his wife , his son, andpossibly his home.John P arsons’ FBI files r efer to his father as a captain (i.e ., “CaptainMarvel”), and one of the ne wspaper articles written at the time of John’s deathrefer to his father as a major . It has been said that Marvel worked for WoodrowWilson (President, 1913-1921) or Warren G. Har ding (President, 1921-1923), butthis information is unconfirmed.Marvel may have passed away in 1922, because the 1923 Pasadena city dir ectorylists R uth P arsons as a wido w for the fir st time . However, the Marvel H.Parsons in the V A records was retired from active duty in October 1939 anddidn’t die until Ma y 12, 1947, although he is evidently not buried in any ofthe VA’s national cemeteries. Rather than his ha ving passed a way in 1923, itseems mor e likely that a man who r ose from enlistee to captain or e ven majorwould require an entire career to do so, and four or fiv e years just isn’tenough. It may be that Ruth Parsons fibbed a little to co ver up the stigmaattached to her div orce.According to John, R uth (and perhaps her par ents) cultivated a hatred in herson for the father he never knew. In his essay Analysis By A Master of theTemple he wrote (in the third person), “Your father separated from your motherin order that you might grow up with a hatred of authority and a spirit of revolution necessary to my work. The Oedipus complex was needed to formulate thelove of witchcraft which would lead you into magick, with the influence of yourgrandfather activ e to pr event too complete an identification with y ourmother.”Of his childhood he wrote, “Your isolation as a child developed the necessarybackground of literature and scholarship; and the unfortunate experiences withother childr en [developed] the requisite contempt for the crowd and for thegroup mores. You will note that these factors developed the needful hatr ed forchristianity [sic] (without implanting a christian [sic] guilt sense) at an extremely early age.”In The Book of AntiChrist (written by him just prior to Analysis By A Master ofthe Temple) John Parsons alleges to have invoked Satan at age 13, cowering infear when he appeared. This event would have occurred in late 1927 or sometimein 1928. The r eason for the invocation is not given, but it may have had to dowith his problems with other children. It seems that in moments of distr ess nota fe w children have turned to magic, witchcraft or called upon “the devil.”In the dir ectory listing of 1928 the P arsons and the Whitesides show up at1105 Glen Oaks Blvd., Pasadena, where Walter Whiteside was listed as homeo wner.Glen Oaks w as a br and ne w street that year, not listed in any of the previouscity directories. There was only one other house on the str eet, which must have been the start of a new housing development. Evidently Walter was doing verywell at work, selling the old place and ha ving a brand new home built forhimself.Around this time, when he w as in the eighth gr ade, John made a lifelong friendwhen he found himself at the wr ong end of a bully’ s attention. One y oungfello w, Edw ard S. F orman, interv ened on Parsons’ behalf, and the two wereinseparable after that. Parsons and Forman soon learned the y shared otherinterests: For example, both read the works of Jules Verne, especially From theEarth to the Moon, and Hugo Gernsback’ s ne w magazine of “scientifiction”called Amazing Stories.The boys shared an interest in rockets that was more than theoretical. Theyloved to blow off fireworks in Parsons’ backyard, and in 1928 they began toexperiment with small, solid-fuel rockets. People who knew Parsons at the timesaid his y ard w as full of holes and burn spots fr om the constant activity .Inter estingly, F orman later stated that he and P arsons often used glue as abinder to hold together the various gunpowder mixtures they prepared for theirlittle rockets, a fact that will be important later on.The adult male r ole model in P arsons’ life w as his gr andfather Walter,though Parsons’ own writings show that Ruth was clearly the major influence inhis life . It seems P arsons never knew his birth father, growing up frominfancy with Walter and Carrie Whiteside in their house . John Bluth, ar chivistof NASA’s Jet Pr opulsion Laboratory, has speculated that some adult must ha veencour aged Parsons’ early inter est in r ockets and fir eworks. P erhaps it was merely a neighbor or a teacher, but it may have been his grandfather Walter.For some reason the family moved very quickly, appearing in the Pasadena citydir ectory of 1929 at 285 N. San R afael A ve. This address was a new number onthis street in this year, which leads one to assume that Walter Whiteside wastaking advantage of the expansion taking place in Pasadena. For the first timethe city directory lists Walter’s occupation. Her e he’ s sho wn to be themanager of Annandale Corporation, indicating a probable promotion.Years later, John Parsons would tell the FBI that he toured Europe in 1929 withhis “par ents,” a r eference that must ha ve been to his mother andgrandparents, who were the only parents he had. Such a trip would be affordablefor a well-to-do man like Walter. Ruth’s obituary said she tr aveled to Europeon several occasions with her parents. At least one of these trips must haveincluded her son.Of his teenage years, Parsons wrote in Analysis By A Master of the Temple,“Early adolescence continued the development of the necessary combinations. Theawakening interest in chemistry and science prepared the counterbalance for thecoming magical a wakening, the means of obtaining pr estige and liv elihood inthe formativ e period, and the scientific method necessary for m ymanifestation. The magical fiasco at the age of 16 [193 0 or ’3 1, referenceuncertain] w as needful to k eep you away from magick until y ou weresufficiently matured.”Around the time of this m ysterious “magical fiasco” in 193 1, John’s grandfather, Walter, passed a way. Carrie Whiteside subsequently listed her selfas a wido wer in the 1932 dir ectory. John Parsons, just turning 17, had no wlost his father figur e and r ole model. Most of his adult life John sought outothers to fulfill this role.In the year after his grandfather’s death, Parsons and his boyhood friend EdForman devised a successful e xperiment that shows their interest in rockets wasmore than an amateur concern: the y heated black po wder—which inv olved nolittle danger—and cast it into a wax matrix. Aluminum (pr esumably aluminum oxide powder) was also added as an o xidizer. During the heat of combustion, themixture would release oxygen, which further fueled the burn. P arsons and Formanremembered these early e xperiments later, when the y began to work on rocketsas a profession.That same y ear, 1932, P arsons took a job with the Her cules Powder Company ofPasadena, where Ed Forman may have worked as well, as certainly he did later on.In 1933 P arsons graduated from the Univ ersity School, which some ha veconfused with Univ ersity High School in West Los Angeles. The University SchoolJohn Parsons attended w as a small, priv ate establishment located at 985 E.California St. in P asadena. Attendance at such a priv ate school is anotherindication of the Whiteside-Parsons family’s wealth.Parsons and F orman attended Pasadena Junior College together , and though it remains is unclear what subjects the y studied, both spent two years at the expensive private college, USC (University of Southern California) but neitherman graduated.As they continued to indulge their passion for pckets, Parsons and Formancorresponded with Robert Goddard and some of the Germans and Russians working inthe field. One of the Germans w as science writer Willy Le y, who later fled theNazis to America. Le y was a member of the German Rocket Society in Berlin, aswas Wernher von Braun.14 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-14]Parsons and F orman probably also corr esponded with Hermann Oberth, the fatherof German r ocketry. Oberth had been born in Transylvania and then immigr atedto German y. Ley and v on Braun owed much to him. They no doubt contactedKonstantin Tsiolkovsky, Oberth’s peer in R ussia. The y ma y ha ve alsocontacted the Frenchman Esnault-Pelterie, though no mention is made of him inthe records. Esnault-P elterie w as contempor ary with Oberth and Tsiolkovsky,and was just as well known in the field.Forman later reminisced that they actually learned very little from thecorrespondence within this field, beyond the fact that nobody else had yetachieved much. Parsons and Forman eventually discontinued their letter-writingwhen the y realized they were being pumped for information about their own work,without the others revealing anything about what they were doing, a problem thata later associate of the Pasadena pair, Frank Malina, would also experience whenhe went to visit Robert Goddard.In 1934, John, R uth, and Carrie mo ved to 62 0 St. John A ve., Pasadena, whereCarrie is listed as homeo wner, even though at 2 0 years of age John must ha veassumed the role of man of the house . John left his high school years employerHercules Powder in 1934 to work for Halifax Explosiv es in the Moja ve Desert.Ed F orman was also employed by Halifax, though possibly at a later date.At this time Parsons bought a used car from a local dealership. The salesman was R obert B . R ypinski, who later w orked for Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).Rypinski liked Parsons immediately, and the two shared many interests, becominggood friends and remaining so for a number of y ears. A chance disco very atRypinski’s house a few years later would have great consequences for Parsons,but in the meantime the two enjoyed frequent weekends together, and Rypinksilater r emembered that P arsons “burned with a warm, gem-lik e flame.”In the spring of 1935, John married Helen Northrup in the Church of the LittleFlo wers. The couple met at a chur ch dance. Helen was the daughter of Burton A.and Olga Northrup, and w orked as a secretary at her father’s business, NorthrupBusiness Adjustments. John and Helen bought themselv es a home at 168 S. Terrace Driv e, Pasadena, while Carrie Whiteside bought a new house for herselfand Ruth Parsons at 723 Lincoln, possibly a smaller house just big enough fortwo widows.In his memoirs Parsons cryptically referred to a “loss of family fortune” aroundthis time, perhaps in connection with his gr andfather’s death. He wr ote, “Theearly marriage to Helen serv ed to break your family ties and effect atransference to her, away from a dangerous attachment to y our mother. The experience at Halifax and Cal T ech serv ed to str engthen y our self r eliance,scientific method and material powers. The influence of Tom Rose [referenceuncertain] at this period, as that of Ed F orman in adolescence, was essentialin de veloping the male center .” P arsons also r efers to “. . . Music , Lynn,Curtis , and Gloria, and the incr easing restlessness.” P arsons’ lo ve forclassical music w as gr eat—as w as his mother’s—but the r eferences to Lynn,Curtis , and Gloria, obvious early influences, remain uncertain.Something else happened that autumn, something that would cure the r estlessnessand change the dir ection of P arsons’ life for ever. After seeing an article inthe Pasadena Evening Post about a lecture given at the California Institute ofTechnology (Cal Tech or Caltech), Parsons and pal Ed F orman went to campus totalk to the speak er. The topic was the rocket experiments of the Austrian EugenSänger, and the lecture had been given by a graduate student named WilliamBollay, which is still on file in the JPL archives. Though the speech waswritten in 1935, it appear s to ha ve been pr esented se veral times—perhaps aslate as 1939. It concludes with speculation on the possibility of “stratosphericpassenger carriers,” i.e., “spaceships.”NASA’s Jet Pr opulsion Labor atory began in the 192 0s and w as known as theGuggenheim A eronautical Labor atory, California Institute of Technology(GALCIT). GALCIT started as an aerodynamics research laboratory funded by amember of the famous Guggenheim family and administered by Caltech. In 1926,GALCIT came under the direction of the w ell-known Hungarian pr ofessor Theodore v on Kármán (1881-1963).Born in Budapest on Ma y 11, 1881, v on Kármán w as descended from Rabbi JudahLoew ben Bezalel of Prague, and he often boasted of his ancestor’s reputationfor having created a golem, “an artificial human being in Hebrew folkloreendowed with life .” 15 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-15] Unmentionedin his autobiogr aphy, The Wind and Beyond , the golem appear s in severalsecondary sources. Though not relevant to our discussion of GALCIT, the creation of the golem is a topic w e will r eturn to later when we discuss“magical children.”After graduating Göttingen Univ ersity in German y, v on Kármán was awarded afellowship there, and began to conduct r esearch on aerodynamic drag in one ofEur ope’s first wind tunnels , which he built for this purpose . He later mo vedto the position of Chair of Aeronautics at the T echnische Hochschule in Aachen,German y, where GALCIT’s Clark Millikan found him in 1926. Clark Millikan wasthe son of Caltech president Robert Millikan and the head of the GALCIT lab whenhe recruited von Kármán away from Aachen.Von Kármán’s specialty was the new, wide-open field of aeronautics, and heeventually influenced a number of students who went on to great things in theiro wn right. One of his pupils w as a graduate student named Frank J. Malina, whowas born October 2, 1912 in the small to wn of Br enham, T exas, northw est ofHouston. In 1934, Malina earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering from TexasA&M in nearby College Station and was working toward his Ph.D. at Caltech whenParsons and Forman presented themselves to William Bollay at the latter’slecture on Eugen Sänger’s rocket experiments. For Malina, von Kármán became afather figur e, much like the one Parsons was still seeking.Although the older man did not actualize his father fixation, when Parsons waswith v on Kármán, he kne w was in the pr esence of a great man. In turn, v onKármán called P arsons “a delightful scr ewball” who “loved to recite paganpoetry to the sky while stamping his feet”—a r eference to Aleister Cr owley’s“Hymn to P an,” which Parsons loved to recite. At a party at the big house at1003 S. Orange Grove Ave. where he would eventually live, Parsons stood in abalcony above the gathering and r ecited the Hymn fr om memory after beingprompted by Andrew Haley, v on Kármán’s attorney. A erojet employee Fritz Zwickyr elated that P arsons invoked P an, the wild, horned god of fertility, beforeeach rocket test. Parsons was probably not the only one pr esent at such dangerous tests who said a pr ayer. His heter odoxy notwithstanding, v on Kármán wrote in 1958 that Parsons was the third most important person in the developmentof rocketry in the United States—behind only himself and Frank Malina. VonKármán praised Parsons’ “rich talent for chemistry” and perhaps induced byParsons’ beliefs, von Kármán found it necessary to say he read John Symonds’ TheGreat Beast, an early, somewhat sensationalistic biography of Aleister Crowley,the infamous “black magician” who exerted so much influence over Parsons.After appearing at Bollay’s lecture on Sänger, Parsons and Forman used theopportunity to ask Bolla y about working at Caltech, where they could get thenecessary funds for their e xperiments with r ockets. Though unable to dir ectlyhelp P arsons and F orman, Bolla y directed them to F rank Malina. Although Parsons and Forman held no degrees, Malina was able to spot their usefulqualities right away. Forman was the expert mechanic while Parsons knew powderexplosives backward and forward, even developing the practice of visitingindustrial accidents to determine cause of e xplosions. The two men revealedtheir love of rocketry and developing ways of making them work. People rememberParsons as the theor etician and Forman as the mechanic, perfectly complementingone another . The pair w ere an inseparable team and an inv aluable componentfor Malina, who later wr ote that P arsons “lack ed the discipline of formal training, [but] had an uninhibited fruitful imagination.” The lack of disciplineand uninhibited fruitful imagination w ould naturally spill o ver into otherareas of Parsons’ life.Inspired by Parsons’ and Forman’s support, Malina prepared a dissertation on rocket propulsion. Targeting Clark Millik an to sponsor his doctorate, Millikanrefused, an act that Malina resented from then on. Malina took his pr oject downthe Caltech hall to v on Kármán, who immediately appr oved of it and pr ovidedhis support. V on Kármán was well known for considering what other s thought tobe too kooky; after all, rockets were still viewed as science fiction by thepublic. The mer e mention of r ockets had people thinking of such impossiblethings as trips to the moon and r arely anything else. Von Kármán’s allo wed Parsons and F orman to use the lab at GALCIT despite their lack of affiliationwith the school.Malina later wr ote of being influenced b y reading Jules Verne’s From the Earthto the Moon at the age of 12, as had P arsons and Forman. (Malina actually readit in Czech, when he lived in that country with his parents for a few years.)All three enjoyed the excitement of trial-and-error experimentation, thoughMalina also understood the importance of theor etical w ork, upon which v onKármán alw ays insisted. Since P arsons and F orman were anxious to test rockets to prove brash theories, Malina best served his role by inducing them towork out their theoretical work. When experiments seemed to reach a dead end,Parsons would go to v on Kármán, who’d perform a fe w quick calculations and saysomething like, “Yes, John, it is possible to achieve success in the dir ectionyou are heading, but fir st you must work out se veral dependant v ariables inthe field.” Fieldw ork w as Parsons’ specialty; and for this v ery reason one istempted to think von Kármán should ha ve found him mor e important than Malinain his 1958 list of the most important people in aer ospace.Malina corresponded heavily with his par ents in Texas when he was de veloping rocketry with Parsons, F orman and v on Kármán. Significant portions of theseletter s are preserved in the JPL archives under the file, “Excerpts fromLetters Written Home.” Taken together with the memoirs Malina later wrote, thesemissives provide valuable insight and a complete picture into the earlydevelopment of rockets in the United States.The first mention of P arsons and Forman in Malina’s documents comes on February14, 1936. By March 30, Malina referred to the pair and himself as the “gr oup.”After r eviewing the scant liter ature on the subject of rockets, the groupdecided that their first goal would be to develop a working motor. Stationarytests of motor s, rather than launching test r ockets, w as the fir st priority. Other e xperimenters bypassed this important step, failing as a r esult. VonKármán persuaded GALCIT to lease three acres of land from the city of P asadenain the area known as the Arroyo Seco, which exists in the shadow of the SanGabriel Mountains , just above the dam called De vil’s Gate. The acr eage w asthe site of the ne w gr oup’s e xperiments. Today, NASA’s Jet PropulsionLaboratory is situated there.The great experiment started slowly. Malina writes on April 5 that Parsons and Forman take jobs at a po wder company. Presumably they returned to Halifax. Ev enthough r ockets were their passion, there was no mone y in it—y et. On April 13,Malina wr ote that he hadn’t seen either of them for at least se veral days;Parsons finally phoned Malina on Ma y 24, telling him that he almost had a rocket motor completed.A month later, on June 18, Malina writes of P arsons testing with powder, areference to a solid fuel called “ballistite ,” which is made by inserting acompressed black powder into the r ocket motor so it will burn more slowly andevenly. The compression is accomplished by heating smokeless powder at fir st,then extruding it under pr essure into long thin rods. Smokeless powder is a“double-base propellant” consisting of nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose, aformula known since the time of Alfr ed Nobel, the inv entor of dynamite. Thispr opellant was the fuel that e ventually powered bazook a rockets and was notmuch different from the wax and aluminum used by Parsons and Forman in 1932.Ballistite w as used in some of their tests prior to their work with GALCIT.The work took off r apidly once the testing started. On June 29, Malina wrote,“Parsons and I drove all over Los Angeles—looking for high pressure tanks andmeter s. Didn’t ha ve any luck. Two instruments we need costs $60 a piece and weare trying to find them second hand. I am convinced it is a hopeless task. Willhave to approach Kármán.” The group’s lack of funds reflects that GALCIT wasn’tanxious to bankr oll a pr oject the y felt w as far-fetched. Malina approachedProfessor Irving P. Krick, who made a lot of money forecasting weather for moviestudios. Though intrigued by the possibilities, Krick did not contribute .Parsons, F orman, and Malina w ere required to fund the project on their own.On July 18, Malina wr ote, “The early part of this w eek Jack Parsons and Icovered much of Los Angeles looking for equipment. Our next lead points to LongBeach. P arsons is planning to start manufacturing explosives with another fellow [Forman]. Up to the present time he has been w orking for an explosivesconcern. Hope they make a go of it. I have found in Parsons and his wife [Helen]a pair of good intelligent friends.” “Hope they make a go of it” almost soundsdefeatist, but Malina persisted.In the summer of 1936, Malina took the tr ouble to visit R obert Goddard(1882-1945) in R oswell, Ne w Me xico. Goddar d left Connecticut for Roswellyears earlier to work on his own rocket project, about which he was verysecretive. Goddard actually worked in Pasadena for a while during World War I,in the v ery Arroyo Seco where Parsons, Malina, and F orman were laboring.Malina visited Goddard to get ideas for his own research and to perhaps find anew position working for Goddard—who had funding—rather than at the cheap domainof Caltech.At the invitation of Harry Guggenheim and v on Kármán, who were interested inrecruiting him, Goddard visited Caltech. Unwilling to lea ve R oswell, Goddar dr equested that Caltech send Malina to Roswell to visit his facility, whichMalina did in September.During Malina’s visit, Goddard was polite on the surface, but displayed obvioustension. As Goddar d sho wed him ar ound, Malina realized his host didn’t sho wanything of v alue. Malina kne w right away that Goddard wanted another hand todo the har d work rather than a co-r esearcher. Malina r eturned to Californiadisappointed. Goddard later refused a position at Caltech offered by ClarkMillikan, probably understanding he would just be another scientist on a largecampus, rather than the head of his o wn program. In his memoir s, von Kármánmade some rather negative comments about Goddard’s research suffering fromself-imposed isolation.Back at Caltech, “the gr oup” was joined b y three others: Apollo M.O. Smith(called “ Amo” b y his friends), Carlos C. Wood, and Rudolph Schott, bringingthe total to six. Smith was a Caltech student like Malina, and r egarded aneccentric since he constantly w ore a pith helmet he modified by placing a smallcooling fan on top. Wood and Schott were just a couple of guys from town whowalked out to the test site and offer ed their assistance . Schott’s red pickuptruck became the gr oup’s standard means of tr ansporting test appar atus. Therewas also associated with the gr oup for a while an individual named Rockefeller(“Rocky”), but little mention of him e xists in the records. Someone operated amotion picture camera during some of the tests; Rocky may well have been thecamera operator.In September , 1936, Malina got a ne w r oommate: Martin Summerfield(1916-1996), a gr aduate student inter ested in r ockets who arriv ed at Caltechfr om Br ooklyn College in Ne w York. Summerfield went on and made greatadvances in the field of liquid propellants; the Summerfield Burning R ate Lawis named after him. Summerfield became fast friends with Malina, as the tw o hadmany things in common that Malina did not shar e with P arsons. Both Summerfieldand Malina were graduate students, well-versed in theory, while P arsons held nodegr ee and w as entir ely self-tr ained. A week after Summerfield mo ved in,Malina learned that he shar ed birthdays with Parsons, one of the last discoveries they would enjoy together as friends.

From Malina’s letters, one gets the impr ession that this important date meantlittle e xcept another series of tests ending in failure. Even if the daysignified failure to F rank Malina, a photogr apher w as pr esent to get shotsof Rudolph Schott, Amo Smith, Malina, Ed F orman, and John P arsons posing withtesting apparatus. Though the photo is referred to by JPL staff as “the NativityScene ,” Carlos Wood, one of the r esearchers, failed to attend the apparentlymomentous gathering.Once a y ear, on JPL’s Open House for the public , the Nativity Scene is recreated with mannequins just behind the JPL Visitors’ Center. For the 50thanniversary in 1986, JPL contemplated hiring live actors to portr ay the fiv efounder s. This e vent never materialized, but the P arsons mannequin and fourother s are stored at JPL today, stored for the ne xt Open House when the y’llbe put on display. It seems ir onic that this Nativity Scene took place onHalloween in 1936, containing the likeness of a man who signed an oath statinghe w as “the Antichrist.” Photogr aphs of the original scene and the JPLrecreation are reproduced in the photo section of this volume. (It should bepointed out that the Nativity Scene celebrates the test of liquid fuel, thoughthe gr oup worked with both solid and liquid fuel at this time .)The day after the Nativity Scene, an incident occurred that Malina thoughtsignificant to r eport: One of the fuel hoses pulled fr ee, and the fuelspilling out the end ignited. The hose started twisting and turning, a flamingserpent fr om which the y all r an for their liv es. After they composedthemselv es, the gr oup regretted not capturing the moment on film. Later testsfared somewhat better, but the group still measur ed success in ho w man yseconds the r ocket fir ed. By January 16, 1937, they were up to 44 seconds.The test apparatus at Arr oyo Seco was built with borrowed tanks and hoses, Forman later r ecalled. He machined the casing for the chamber himself andstated, “It w as a hand-to-mouth oper ation where y ou r ented machine time for$2 an hour and did the w ork yourself, in a day when wages were 25 cents anhour.” That’s half a day’s wages for one hour of shop time. Forman’s skill inthis precise field is what gave him his excellent reputation as a mechanic. Hecontinued to head the GALCIT/JPL mechanics department for as long as he stayedwith the group.The original schematic for the Nativity Scene test, is dr awn on tracing paperby Malina, who signed both his and Parsons’ names at the bottom. The schematicsshow oxygen flowing from one side, with methyl alcohol (the fuel) and nitr ogenflowing from the other side . Water cooled the r ocket during the burn. Thrustpushed do wn a spring that measured force. The deflection of the spring measuredthe force applied to it. A small diamond tip on the apparatus scratched a glassplate to mark the furthest point of deflection. The r ocket and mount wereprotected by sandbags, with the tanks (and the e xperimenters) well away fromit.Five pages of Parsons’ handwritten notes, which cover the period November 15,1936 to January 17, 1937, begin:The research is conducted with the view of acertaing [sic] the aplication [sic]of the rocket to altitude exploration and other fields, the properties ofvarious fuels and of metals at high temperatur es. Rockets to be investigated are solid fuel r ockets, utilizing explosives or combustibles and liquid r ocketsemploying liquid explosives or liquid or gaseous oxygen and variouscombustibles.Different motors and materials will be tried together with various methods offuel injection. Relevant previous data will be compiled, together with recordsof all tests + calculations. Schematic diagram of test setup for GALCIT rocket research drawn by Frank Malinain August, 1936.005 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_005_r1.gif]Data from the fir st test—the actual Nativity Scene—ar e missing. The secondtest on November 15 employed methyl alcohol at various pressures as a fuel,ignited by a remote battery. All three trials on that second test day ended infailure. In his notes, Parsons remarked that he should switch from rubber tubingto copper tubing to prevent the tubing from burning up during future tests.A third test, on November 28, yielded four burns of v arious duration, the bestof which w as 2 0 seconds. Parsons’ notes outline the various materials used inthese tests , as w ell as their pr ocurement sources, as w ell as a r ecord ofthe test tak en January 16, 1937. Obviously these field notes are incomplete.The long periods of time between each test are due to von Kármán’s insistencethat the group analyze each burn before they start another.While w aiting, Parsons and F orman launched their o wn powder rockets. Malinawrote, “[T]heir attitude is symptomatic of the anxiety of pioneer s of ne wtechnological de velopments. In or der to obtain support for their dr eams, they ar e under pr essure to demonstr ate them before they can be technicallyaccomplished.”Parsons is mentioned in Malina’ s letters a couple of times during this periodand the months follo wing. For the record, Malina wrote on November 21, 1936that P arsons had the flu the pr evious week. Though the first successful testof a solid-fuel rocket motor took place in January 1937, Malina didn’t thinkmuch of it at the time , as it is not even mentioned.The gr oup left the arroyo next April and mo ved on-campus at Caltech, locatedright in P asadena, where they worked out of one of the GALCIT lab buildings.Only v on Kármán w ould have been daring enough to let these unsophisticated researchers work on-campus. In May, Hsue-shen T sien, who had come fr om China ona scholar ship funded by Boxer Rebellion reparations, began working with thegroup, sharing an office with Amo Smith. W eld Arnold, a meteor ology student,contributed b y presenting the gr oup with $1000 in small bills wrapped in a newspaper. No one dar ed ask wher e he got them. A small fund w as opened atCaltech, and the mone y deposited. Curiously, at the end of the war there wasstill $300 left in the account. Arnold became the group’s unofficialphotographer for a while, riding his bicycle at least 20 miles from Los Angelesevery day.Campus residents soon resented the group’s presence. Testing was loud andviolent. Immediately after their arriv al on campus , the group met with theirfir st disaster. In the lab the y had mounted a rocket motor to a 50-footpendulum. They measured the swing of the pendulum to calculate the thrust produced. The fir st motor tested exploded, filling the building with a cloud ofmeth yl alcohol and nitrogen dioxide. A thin layer of rust formed on many piecesof valuable equipment thr oughout the lab . The other campus r esidents startedreferring to the group as “the Suicide Squad.” Parsons would remember this event four y ears later, when he finally figur ed out a way to put the volatilityof red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) to good use.Von Kármán moved the group outside, adjacent to the lab, and had them rebuildthe pendulum, this time making it fiv e times stronger than thought necessary.Two years later the pendulum was destroyed again during an explosion, when apiece of steel was hurled into the wall wher e Malina had been standing justminutes earlier . Fortunately, he had been called a way by von Kármán’ssecretary on some mundane matter concerning a typewriter. After this dangerousincident, back to the arroyo the group went.On March 22 there is another brief mention of Parsons in Malina’s letters, andon April 24 Malina r elated that Parsons was writing a paper “on the chemistryend of it.” This paper w as entitled “ A Consideration of the Pr acticality ofVarious Substances as F uels for Jet Propulsion.” The finished paper is datedJune 19, 1937, and is signed “J. Parsons, Halifax Explosives Company.” Despiteits origin, it was later classified by the government but has long beendeclassified and is on file at the JPL archives, the only paper in the archivesbearing Parsons’ name as the sole author. He was co-author on several otherpapers, but this one was his alone.The paper begins:In considering the practicality of various fuels and oxidizers for rockets,certain criteria apply which ar e not met with in or dinary internal combustionmotor problems.Since rocket performance is influenced by the ratio of fuel weight to totalweight, and since the r ocket must car ry all the oxidizer necessary forcombustion, the ratio of total weight of fuel and oxidizer to the available energy is of utmost importance. Since mass per unit flow is also impor tant, a highspecific gravity is preferred.In addition, ordinary considerations of safety , availability, cost andconvenient physical state should not be neglected.Parsons w as sa ying that the fuel must be dense to pack a r eal punch, and bepowerful enough to lift its o wn weight as well as that of the rocket and thecargo it may be carrying. This seemingly obvious statement is one that nevertheless must be made at the start of analysis. In the paper , Parsonspresents five tables of v arious fuels with some algebraic calculations andchemical equations determining various pr operties of each. These calculationsmak e it clear that Parsons was no amateur r ocket hobbyist. He w as, aseveryone said, the theoretician of the group, even if he was an impatienttheoretician. Parsons had obvious mathematical and scientific kno wledge to backup his assertions . Malina specialized in differ ential calculus, which does notappear in the work of Parsons.Parsons’ first table looks at the explosive gases acetylene, butane, butyne,hydrogen, and methane. He dismisses acetylene as inherently dangerous, withoutcarrying out the calculations of combustive properties. He further mentionspotential pr oblems with h ydrogen and methane. Liquid o xygen is not e ven inthe table , as P arsons eliminates it from calculations altogether as being toodangerous. He was right about this for decades . Only when the safe handling ofliquid oxygen was finally perfected did it r eplace the liquid fuel combinationsthat Parsons himself would help perfect.Table II contains the liquid h ydrocarbons methyl alcohol, eth yl alcohol, propargyl, benzol, eth yl ether, and heptane . All had gr eat availability, werecheap and easy to handle, but all had a low energy content.Table III contains self-combustibles (explosives) such as gunpo w-der, etc., theenergy content of which was low compared to gases and liquids, and which weredifficult to handle. With a few precautions, Parsons added, the y might be rendered useful. P arsons even mentioned that the y might be “moulded or pr essedinto sticks ,” which was the seed of an idea that w ould later lead to success.Table IV addresses metal or ganics and hybrids. Little was known about them,Parsons said, and the y were costly to handle and difficult to prepare. One ofthem, trimeth yl aluminum, is spontaneously inflammable in air . P arsons believed the y w ere w orthy of further investigation, though nothing seems to havecome of it.Table V is labeled “Various Elements” and contains figures for aluminum, boron,carbon, lithium, and magnesium. P arsons thought they may have some value whenblended with other substances, for which aluminum w as already being used in thefield of e xplosives. Parsons further thought the energy obtained from suchblends could be used indirectly to heat another substance, such as water.There is also a sixth table, which lists not fuels but oxidizers, substancesintr oduced into a chemical pr ocess to speed combustion. Much experimentationremained to be done with o xidizers, Parsons concluded. The 13-page papercontains six appendices sho wing values for differ ent materials obtained through actual e xperimentation by Parsons and others. These appendices representthe real-world follow-up to the theoretical calculations showed in the fir stpart of the report. The appendices reflects not only the up-front calculationsbut also actual tests of fuel mixtur es at Halifax. Documenting each steprepresents a lengthy but necessary pr ocess. No definite conclusions werereached, but Parsons always saw in each experiment the beginning of another.Each test led to ne w ideas for him, and he ne ver stopped thinking. The GALCIT Rocket Research Project - Plans and Program for Research at Cal.Tech. Dry Fuel Expeziences-hat can be done with powder rockets? The Rocketor’sWorkshop—Parachutes, valves.006 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_006_r1.gif]The cover of Astronautics uses a schematic diagram of Parsons’, Forman’s andMalina’s GALCIT liquid fuel research set-up.Malina credits Parsons’ paper with the development of red fuming nitric acid asa storable oxidizer. He also pointed out that Parsons first anticipated the useof bor on hydride as a fuel in this paper , putting him ahead of his time. Thekey, as von Kármán said, was to make the fuel burn slowly. In armamentsapplications the fuel w as burned as quickly as possible . Parsons and F ormanhad to unlearn this technique and find a new one.When the term ended the next month, Malina paid Parsons a visit. On May 22—before the paper w as actually finished, Malina wr ote, “Antelope Valley, near Ne wHall—This w eekend I accepted an invitation of Jack Parsons to spend at thehouse he has r ented near the powder company for which he w orks. Jack’ s wife[Helen] is her e which ensures good meals. We are about 40 miles from Pasadenain the foothills.”Antelope Valley is the curr ent site of Edw ards Air F orce Base—a largevalley—and it is uncertain if the po wder company Halifax, for which Parsonslabored, was anywhere near the base. Several explosives companies came fromAntelope Valley, all conveniently remote from the city. John and Helen Parsonsmust not have lived there very long, for the P asadena city dir ectories showthem living at 168 S. Terrace Drive from 1937 to 1940. Perhaps they retained thehouse at S. Terrace, which they owned, and rented the house intermittently inAntelope Valley until Parsons finished his paper in June.While writing the paper, Parsons commuted back to P asadena to do additionaltesting with GALCIT. That group achieved its best results yet in May, running amotor for longer than a minute . However, the graduate students finished theirterm and summer arrived and drifted away. Malina and Tsien focused on doctorateprograms. Weld went to New York. Those who stayed behind collected their paperson rocketry into what the y called “the Bible ,” copies of which e xist in theJPL archives. Parsons’ paper was among the half-dozen or so in the volume.Around this time , P arsons and Malina started to write “ a no vel with ananti-w ar plot” that w as also supposed to serv e as a mo vie treatment. Themanuscript is fr amed in anti-capitalist beliefs , with Malina documenting hisown struggles with corporate culture and the coming w ar in Eur ope. Some writers have claimed the manuscript was some sort of sci-fi story about a flight tothe moon, or about evil rocket scientists. This is not the case.The original script is in the possession of Marjorie Malina, Frank’s widow. Itis untitled and bear s no author’ s name, and is entir ely in Malina’shandwriting. Malina’ s memoir s make it clear that P arsons was a collabor atorand that Malina w orked on the manuscript at Parsons’ house. Indeed, Malinaexpressed being nervous about being around the tetr anitromethane in P arsons’kitchen—a chemical that Parsons was collecting though the army decided it wastoo dangerous to use due to its connection to se veral deaths. Because of its rarity, Parsons was stockpiling the stuff rather than disposing of it, and alsohad enough gunpo wder hoar ded “to blo w up a city block”—this according to EdForman’s first wife, who probably was not exaggerating. The gunpowder was in anopen barrel on the back porch. After Parsons’ death, Malina wr ote that“Parsons’ familiarity with e xplosives led to contempt.”The 38-page handwritten synopsis of the script is full of cr ossed-out passagesand other editing marks , indicating that the tw o men brainstormed together asMalina set it all to paper. The story is about a group of rocketscientists—obviously based on themselves and their associates at Caltech—who arestruggling to carry out pur e research while other factions have more selfishaims for their work—anti-capitalist at almost every turn. The character based onForman is a union organizer. The intellectual characters (and even theirmechanics) are all philosophical heavies. The “bad guys” are all big industrialtypes and those who cater to them. The story is full of side stories inv olvinglove interests and the like. It is also eerily prophetic.The character based on Parsons is named “Theophile Belvedere,” whose descriptionsho ws insight (and possibly a little humor) on Parsons’ part. Belvedere is “amystic who speaks for religion and the organized church.” He is “extremelyfanatical and is to used to add a sinister effect to the plot.” His descriptionis worth quoting verbatim, but it should be k ept in mind that the manuscript was an obvious first draft never taken beyond this stage.Theophile Belvedere is a tall slightly stooped, r osy cheeked man with a facewhose lines continuously change fr om those of joy to those of miser y. Shor tlybefor e the stor y opens he has been defrocked from the Franciscan or der uponhis own suggestion. In the monaster y he has pursued a study of astr onomy, asubject also of interest to the abbot. A small telescope had been built at thecor ner of the monaster y enclosur e wher e Belveder e spent many nights gazingat the stars. The monastery is located on a hill overlooking a small town ofSpanish atmospher e. Once each year a fiesta is held in the town and for manyyears the monks have watched thr ough niches in the enclosur e the parade thattook place on the closing night. On this night Belveder e, as usual, entered thespace between the obser vatory and the corner of the enclosure. He is suddenlysurprised by a young woman in pajamas who in her disarray clutches his arm. Thenext day Belvedere goes to the abbot and confesses his temptation and decidesthat he will leave the order. He learns that the young woman is the daughter ofthe abbot’s br other who has been visiting the monaster y. Belvedere returns toRock [Pasadena] wher e he finds his fanatically religious mother being abused byher dr unken husband. The family is on r elief. Belvedere, having an M.S. degree in science, applies for a public school teaching position in the Rock HighSchool. He is accepted and becomes a teacher of general science. Near the end of the story, Belvedere accidentally blows himself up trying tostop one of his e xperiments—it should be noted that this story was written 15years before Parsons died the same way, an eerie prophecy. F urther, the character based on T sien gets sent back to China under suspicion of communism anddr ops out of touch with the others, an incident that also later occurr ed. Manyof those who remain are investigated for their anti-capitalistic politicalbeliefs, and Malina’s greatest fear—that their w ork would be used for w artimeapplications—also came true . In the story it is a rich inv estor who actuallysells their secrets to the Nazis and Fascists.Included with the manuscript is another movie treatment, some of which is typedon MGM letterhead. F urther handwritten technical descriptions (andillustrations) were composed in Malina’s hand. The typed portion is dated June17, 1937 and entitled “Shado w of the Wing,” bearing Malina’s name as author.The treatment appears to be a different movie project entirely, one that an “M.Balcon” at MGM was evidently considering. “Shado w of the Wing” is the story ofa mock bomber mission from Australia to London that goes awry. The hero is thepilot, who lands the plane despite all odds . Both stories never w ent be yond apr eliminary stage, the fir st due to a sudden influx of funding for the r ocketpr oject, the second for r easons unknown. Lack of interest on MGM’s part,perhaps?On July 4, 1937, Malina wrote, “For our ‘fourth,’ Parsons and I are going tomake some tests with a powder rocket motor,” which sounds like a suitable way tocelebrate both the Fourth of July and the completion of Parsons’ paper just afew days earlier. On the 26th Malina wrote, “Parsons and I y esterday discussedthe possibility of seeing Goddard again. Perhaps he and wife and I would driveto Roswell in his car, he to r eturn while I go on to T exas . . .” The y didnot make the trip. The wording suggests that Parsons had visited Goddardpreviously, but such a trip is not r ecorded elsewhere.As the months proceeded, Malina focused on his doctor al thesis, which he hadbeen postponing for some time . Work on the thesis moved him closer toSummerfield and further fr om Parsons. Malina next refers to the rocket projecta full five months later, on December 18. “Parsons wants to mak e some teststhis w eekend” was all that Malina wr ote, causing one to w onder wh y he e venmentioned it. Later that December Malina lectur ed the local Sigma Xi chapter on“Facts and Fancies of Rockets.” And the group made the newspapers on January 26,1938, when Malina and Smith tr aveled to New York to present a paper to theInstitute of A eronautical Sciences. Clark Millikan had convinced the school toput up $2 00 for the trip—Caltech’s fir st dir ect financial support of the project. That da y in January, articles appear ed in the New York Times and theHouston Chronicle, as w ell as in the Los Angeles Times , New York HeraldTribune , and Time magazine.The story begins, “A scheme for shooting an exploratory rocket to a height of967 miles abo ve the earth w as unfolded today before a convention of aeronautical engineer s.” Malina and Smith told the convention “the idea works intheory . . . whether it will work in fact depends on the efficiency of therocket.” They proposed a three-stage rocket with a maximum velocity of 11,000miles per hour. As a result of the publicity , a Ne w York stuntman w anted toride a r ocket up 1000 feet and par achute down at county fair s, and one Hollywood radio station wanted to broadcast the sound of a rocket motor firing.On February 2, 1938, the Caltech student paper California Tech printed anarticle on rockets written by Malina with the help of Smith and Tsien. In Aprilof 1938, the Associated Pr ess released an item about the group’s work that isworth quoting verbatim, as it is contains valuable information unrecorded inMalina’s letters. It reads:Frank J. Molina [sic] and thr ee student-scientists [pr obably Parsons, Forman,and Smith] ar e working on a motor fr om which they hope to develop anotherwhich will take a r ocket nearly 100 miles above the earth’s surface.They see it car rying instr uments to obtain data useful in weather forecasting,records on cosmic radiation, facts valuable to astronomers and information forother scientific purposes.This motor, set up at the Guggenheim School of Aer onautics, CaliforniaInstitute of Technology, is a combustion chamber which mixes and bur ns gaseousoxygen and ethelene [sic] at 5000 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature about halfthat of the sun [!].The flaming gas comes out of the “exhaust” at a speed of around 9000 feet asecond. With a “step r ocket,” one with three motors, two of which would be released in flight, a speed of 11,000 feet a second might be reached, Molinasaid.“After experiments with gases, we will next tr y liquids,” said Molina, “forthat is what the rocket will have to use. We can allow only seven-tenths of thetotal weight of the r ocket for propellants.“The design of the r ocket will be highly impor tant because of the difficultyin keeping one in a straight course. Experiments have shown rockets may bedeflected in a change in air currents. A gyroscope may help meet this difficulty.“Our aim is to devise a r ocket which will carry scientific instruments toheights of about 500,000 feet, far above those r eached by sounding balloons.The record for a sounding balloon, I believe, is 110,000 feet. We are workingeverything out by theory, so far as is possible.”Molina said the decr ease with altitude in the ear th’s gravitational pull willbe a favorable factor in building r ockets to r each even greater heights. His reckoning is that this pull is one-tenth less 200 miles up than at the ear th’ssur face, and that it decreases proportionately with altitude.Soon after, Malina and the gr oup abandoned step r ockets altogether. The APitem spawned several more newspaper articles about the group’s work, but Malinalamented all the fuss, as is evidenced by the conspicuous absence of rockettravel from the above quote. (The public still identified rockets with trips tothe moon.) Malina did not appear in subsequent ne wspaper articles, but P arsonsand F orman readily did, and were photographed repeatedly. They clearly saw thisexposure as a way to gain attention—and perhaps some funding.Parsons also seemed to enjo y the status his w ork br ought and sometimesexaggerated his title when pr esenting himself to other s. He w ould callhimself “Engineer ,” a false title since he held no degree, though he actuallyhad a more practical knowledge of explosives than man y engineers who did ha vedegrees. The occupations listed for Parsons in the Pasadena city directoriessimply came from whatever the homeowner told the compiler of the directories.Parsons started out calling himself a “chemist,” and later on calling himself a“research assistant” at Caltech. A letter of recommendation he wrote for R obertDr oz bear s the signatur e block, “Pr oject Engineer , Aeronautics Department.”T wo GALCIT organizational charts in the JPL archives do make one thing clear: Parsons was the sole individual in charge of the solid fuel program.May 1938 found P arsons in the courtr oom, named by Caltech as their best explosives expert when the pr osecutor of a mur der trial contacted the institute. The case for which he serv ed as an e xpert witness was a mur der by car bomb.The trial lasted months and is well-documented in the Los Angeles Evening Herald and Express. Parsons is mentioned in articles on Ma y 6 and Ma y 10, thelatter of which has a photo of him.The defendants in the case were Captain Earle E. Kynette and his two aides,Lieutenants Roy Allen and Fred Browne of the Los Angeles city police’s “spysquad” who were accused of planting a pipe bomb in the car of another officer ,Harry R aymond. Raymond was a vice investigator; and apparently the threecrooked cops thought he w as getting too close for comfort. When R aymondstepped on the starter switch, the bomb e xploded, killing him. The mur der tookplace on January 14 of that year.After surv eying the a vailable e vidence, P arsons pr epared a mockup of thebomb for the jury to see . In the Los Angeles Herald and Express May 10 photo,Parsons is seen displaying his mockup to prosecutor Gene Williams. It is asix-inch piece of pipe , three inches in diameter, capped at both ends , with apair of wir es leading to it. Parsons stated that the original contained a poundof pressed powder and “jagged bits of metal.” The bomb destroyed both thevictim’s car and the garage it was parked in.After leaving the courtroom on May 6 Parsons went to the desert near Lancasterwith a w orking model of the alleged pipe bomb , destroying an old car with it.Despite intense cr oss-examination, Parsons r emained firm in his testimon ythat the bomb contained smokeless powder and not some other e xplosive. The LosAngeles Times speaks highly of him in this r egard. He could not be shak en,remarkable for a 23-year-old. JPL reconstructs the GALCIT project’s organizational chart of 1941 showing JohnParsons in char ge of its solid fuel program.007 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_007_r1.gif]Several police officer s refused to testify against their former colleaguesduring the course of the lengthy trial, but the three were convicted nonetheless. A bomb thr eat w as called in on the da y of Parsons’ testimony, the callerstating, “I am a friend of Kynette and a member of the police for ce, and y outell [special pr osecutor] Joe Fainer if he doesn’t la y off K ynette I’ll bombhim the w ay Harry Raymond was bombed.” F ainer was not bombed, but thisincident may have had something to do with Parsons’ death 14 years later.The same month of the trial, Ma y 1938, a technical article aimed at r ocketeersappear ed in Astronautics: Journal of the American Rocket Society, issue 41.Parsons was not mentioned. On July 15, the morning edition of the PasadenaStar-News printed a mor e sensational article, in which Parsons and Formanappear in a large photograph, Parsons in a dark suit, Forman in a cream-coloredjacket with matching driver’s cap. Forman smokes thoughtfully as both men leanon their elbo ws in fr ont of their launch appar atus. A small, single-stagemodel rocket hovers just overhead—obviously inserted into the photo by means ofdouble-e xposure. The article giv es some highlights of the pair’ s work in theArr oyo Seco. By this time T sien had taken leave from the group, laterreturning to work on Rocket Project No. 1 at Caltech, while P arsons and theother s worked at GALCIT in the arroyo.The Los Angeles Examiner ran its o wn account of w ork in the arroyo. Thearticle doesn’t vary from the Pasadena Star-News article, except for having adifferent photo. This L.A. Examiner photo is one of the best early photos of Parsons and Forman around. Unlike the Pasadena photo, it w as actually tak enindoors. The caption could have read “Gentlemen Rocketeers.” Both men wore darkjackets and ties, with hair slick ed back and mustaches w ell-trimmed. Parsonsstands on the left, holding a multi-stage rocket, while Forman kneels on theright, inspecting the spring-oper ated testing device.Unlike Parsons, Malina did not appr eciate publicity, feeling that the grouphadn’t accomplished anything worth publicizing. Nearly a year elapsed beforeMalina said anything more about Parsons in letters home, and one can almost feelthe tension as the “good intelligent friends” drifted apart. Malina’ s letter sw ere no w full of references to r oommate and fello w doctor ate candidateMartin Summerfield. On October 24, 1938, Malina wrote, “A ‘big shot’ from theArmy Ordnance division w as here today. He told of the arm y’s experience with rockets and thought ther e was little possibility of using them for militarypurposes . I silently r ejoiced, ho wever Parsons, who is about broke, was notso happy about it, as he hoped to get some funds for research from the army.”This sour ce of funding became another contentious point, as Malina w as againstall military applications of his w ork. He w as interested in civilian innovations only—namely , scientific applications that would benefit mankind, aswell as possibly (eventually) an improved means of travel. Parsons wasinterested in the end result—working rockets—and wasn’t concerned about how hegot there. As it turned out, both Malina and the “big shot” were wrong—therewere military applications for rockets just around the corner.At one point Malina was invited to visit Ruben Fleet, President of theConsolidated Aircraft Company in San Diego, who gave Malina a tour and asked himabout the possibility of rocket-assisted takeoffs of “big, heavy planes.” Malinaleft, intrigued, but nothing came of the meeting until thr ee years later, afterP arsons had spent some mor e time experimenting. In fact, seaplanes were notfitted with JATOs until 1943 and they were liquid-fueled.Malina also prepared a scientific paper for a contest in France that wassponsored by André Louis Hirsch, a banker with an above-average interest inrocketry. The contest was to award a cash prize to the best paper on currentissues in the field. Malina won, but because of the war he did not learn of hisprize until 1946—far too late for the winnings to help the pr oject. Tsienappears to ha ve helped Malina with the a ward-winning paper, though it bor eMalina’s name solely as author.At this time, an interesting reversal of responsibility is recorded in Malina’sletters home , in which he had written that P arsons and Forman “disappear forweeks or months sometimes with me trying to keep the project alive. They wereworking for the powder companies and testing their own rockets during thesetimes .” Malina took other time-consuming jobs, including wind-tunnel studiesand a soil conservation project. Such outside endea vors increased tension inthe group. Four months later, in a letter dated F ebruary 19, 1939, Malinawrote, “Parsons is doing some experiments with powder and is disgusted with mefor not putting mor e time in to the r esearch.” The results of the powderexperiments were written up by Parsons, who shar ed a b yline with F orman inissue 43 of Astronautics. Certainly this b yline was merely a courtes y, as thearticle is obviously Parsons’ work.The title of the article is “Experiments with Powder Motors for RocketPropulsion by Successive Impulses .” Like Parsons’ previous paper, it w asclassified during the w ar, though the article w as presumably still incirculation. The article begins with an editorial comment fr om the publisher tothe effect that “the American R ocket Society belie ves the liquid fuel r ocketmotor has v ery definitely proven its superiority over powder motors . . .” Thisassertion would be proven wrong in two years’ time.The article, the technical analysis of which leaves little doubt that Parsonswas the author, starts with a discussion of Goddar d’s work from 1919 forwardand includes Goddard’s early results with rockets using black po wder as a fuel,a method b y which he w as able to achieve altitudes of 8000 feet, i.e., amile-and-a-half up. Parsons then goes into a detailed explanation of his owntest apparatus, including very e xact specifications used to construct his rocket motor s. Hercules black powder alone was used in the first series oftests, and different results were obtained for differ ent degrees of compression (i.e., ho w densely the po wder was packed into the r ocket). Otherpowders were used in the r emaining experiments, including smokeless varieties,and different types of wads were used at the bottom to hold the fuel in. Mostchar ges were ignited by an electric wir e run through this wadding and into thefuel source.Parsons concludes the article with the assertion that po wder was indeedefficient enough to pursue further. Indeed, he and Forman got rockets to r eachvelocities of 7150 feet per second (4875 miles per hour) in this series of tests, which appr oached what Goddar d had achieved 20 years earlier. Parsons saidthey were working on an erosion-resistant insert of special steel as w ell as asatisfactory method of measuring chamber pr essures. Erosion was often a problem with the throat nozzle—the part of the rocket from which the burning fuelleaves the r ocket and pushes it up. In the article , Parsons thanked Malina,Tsien, a Mr. Spade of the Ludlum Steel Compan y, and a Mr. Henry N. Mar sh ofthe Her cules P owder Compan y, which w as Parsons’ original emplo yer from1932. A t the time the article w as written, Parsons was employed by HalifaxExplosives.Around this time some mone y finally came thr ough, and the school received a$10,000 grant to work on solid-fuel rockets, based on the gr oup’s pr ogress.About this time , F ritz Zwicky , who had taken graduate courses under Einstein,scolded Malina for thinking that a rocket could ever fly in space , asking howthe exhaust could push against a v acuum. What Zwicky didn’t r ealize w as thatdisplacement of mass w as all that w as needed. On Mar ch 13 Malina wrote,“Parsons and Forman are to work full time and earn enough money to affor dsmoking r eady-rolled cigar ettes. P arsons’ wife [Helen] will be happ y thatshe is not the only br eadwinner in the family.” Parsons’ good friend Rypinskirelated much the same thing, that Helen would “cry on his shoulder” that Parsonswould only save his money for rockets, and not spend it on her.This stroke of financial luck was the result of a visit by H.H. “Hap” Arnold,commanding gener al of the Arm y Air Corps . Arnold w as a sharp individual whowould work with von Kármán for many years after the w ar, and alw ays on thelook out for some ne w scientific development to be used for militaryapplications . Unlik e the previous military “big shot” who visited, Arnold w asintrigued b y the possible uses for r ockets. Ed F orman, for instance , recalled Arnold’s suggestion that r ockets might help airplanes tak e off whilebeing as much as 50% over payload.Arnold had w orked with v on Kármán befor e. Though Arm y Ordnance was againstexploring the possibilities of rockets, Hap was less conv entional, and had taken Malina and v on Kármán to Washington the year previously on an unrelatedmatter. He knew talent when he saw it and convinced the National Academy ofSciences’ Committee on Air Corps Research to fund the grant. Von Kármán andRobert Millikan were both members of the committee , which made Arnold’s jobmuch easier . There were actually se veral aeronautics projects being funded atthis time, but the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) avoided the rocket project, opting to w orking on the problem of deicing air craftwindshields. “Kármán can tak e the Buck R ogers job” said the head of their aeronautics department. Kármán was glad he did and later called the project “one ofthe most fascinating periods of my career.”On April 18, 1939, a pr oposal w as submitted to the Boar d of Directors atCaltech entitled, “Pr oposal for a Jet Pr opulsion Experimental Station at theGuggenheim A eronautical Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology.”The draft I have seen has the title “Chairman, Subcommittee for Jet Pr opulsionResearch” below the signature block. Presumably this “Chairman” w as von Kármán,though the work is probably Malina’s. Two pages of summary are followed by an$80,000 cost estimate for the initial annual budget, with a footnote explainingthat the figure does not include the cost for constructing the facility itself.As to the construction, F orman later told a Lockheed compan y newsletter thathe made an arrangement with a local bulldozer operator who worked for the cityto grade the experimental station arena in the Arroyo Seco. The group itselffabricated the buildings from timbers and other items found in the arroyo, a“complex” that was a far cry from the 6000-employee facility JPL of today. Inhis memoir, von Kármán says he originally obtained the land, countering Forman’s similar, and perhaps exaggerated, claim.In the follo wing months, Parsons and F orman are mentioned in passing inseveral Malina letters, and both earn a longer mention in his letter of A ugust21 when a lar ge explosion hit the building the y were working in on campus .The explosion occurred at 8:2 0 in the morning, “too early for Parsons andForman to be at work,” causing $10,000 in damage to the building—the entirevalue of the grant. The explosion caused an unr ecognizable film to deposititself on e verything in the building, and when Parsons and Forman finallyarrived, the Caltech staff were waiting for them with cleaning rags, expectingthe two to clean it up. As had happened after the e xplosion of 1937, the groupwas soon working back in the arroyo.On October 21, Parsons and Forman received invitations to a staff dinner at theAthenaeum, but old, social prejudices arose when they presented themselv es atthe door . “You tw o ar en’t Caltech staff. You’re from town,” they were told bythe overzealous doorman, who wouldn’t let them in despite their invitations.About this time Malina arrived and convinced the man the pair should be let injust this once, to save face for Caltech, claiming he would ensure that themistake of inviting them w ould not be made again. The doorman w as swayed, andthe two were finally allowed to enter.On No vember 26, 1939, the magazine supplement to the Los Angeles Sunday Timesran an article on Parsons, Forman and Malina featuring a photogr aph of the first two, stating that the thr ee “ are tired of explaining they are not trying tobuild a rocket ship for initiation of the fir st airline tour s to the moon.”Their goal, the article said, was the exploration of the properties of nearspace. No mention of Hap Arnold’ s pr oject w as made , but other scientists’ideas on accomplishing this exploratory feat were also discussed. Theaccompanying photo shows Forman at the controls of a liquid fuel test pit, whichreplaced the earlier open-air tests, as well as the old-fashioned sandbags stillin hea vy use . In the photo P arsons stands behind Forman, taking notes . Laterhe had the idea of photogr aphing the gauges rather than trying to writeeverything down during the short-duration burns, a policy that made it mucheasier to document the actual readings.Around this time Parsons made an interesting discovery in Robert Rypinski’slibrary, a disco very that w ould change the dir ection of Parsons’ personallife as much as Bollay’s lecture changed the direction of his pr ofessional life. When P arsons rummaged thr ough Rypinski’s library he found a cop y ofAleister Cr owley’s Konx Om Pax, published in 1907, which Rypinski had boughtyears earlier. The discovery, Rypinski said, was to Parsons “like real water toa thirsty man.” Rypinksi himself never had figured out the rather dense book, sohe gave it to Parsons, who soon told him he had entered into correspondence withits author.Although r ecorded in se veral places , including Nat F reedland’s The OccultExplosion and Sybil Leek’s Diary of a Witch , the story is untrue that Crowleyhad once been in Pasadena long enough to start a lodge for his mystical order,the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). In reality, Crowley did make a brief stopo verin Los Angeles in 19 15—and couldn’t wait to leave. Not until 20 years laterwould there be an official r epresentative of the OTO in the ar ea, namely Wilfred T albot Smith, at whose home P arsons was to present himself shortly afterhis discovery of Cr owley. It seems mor e than coincidental that the only lodgeof the OTO was located within a fe w miles of P arsons’ home.Some familiarity with the magus Cr owley (1875-1947) will be assumed throughoutthe remainder of this book, though I will elaborate on the elements of his w orkthat have a direct bearing upon the work of John P arsons. Readers wishing tolearn about Cr owley are referred to the w orks listed in the bibliogr aphy;however, a satisfactory biography of the powerful and enigmatic Crowley remainsto be published.Crowley’s Los Angeles representative, Smith, was from Tonbridge, Kent, about 2 0miles southeast of London. He started his magical career as a member of theoriginal Agape Lodge in Vancouver, British Columbia—the fir st North Americanlodge of the OTO—of which “Frater A chad” (Charles Stansfeld Jones , 1885-195 0)w as the founder. Smith had met Cr owley at the Agape Lodge in 1915, during thelatter’s second American tour, and had soon risen to a position of greaterauthority in the Lodge , as A chad (Hebr ew for “Unity”) fell into disfavor withCrowley and was eventually expelled for a variety of her esies. Smith mo ved toLos Angeles in 193 0, and, upon his arrival, began w orking on r eopening the Agape Lodge, sometimes referred to as Agape Lodge #2. Smith’s colleague wasRegina Kahl, who served as his High Priestess of the Gnostic Mass. The two aresaid to have run the Agape Lodge very strictly, almost tyr annically. Separ atephotos of K ahl and Smith ar e reproduced in Crowley’s OTO publication, TheEquinox, vol. III, no. 10.The Gnostic Mass was Crowley’s replacement for the “corrupted” mass celebr atedb y the R oman Catholic and Eastern Orthodo x churches. The text of the Mass,referred to as Liber XV, was written in Moscow in 1913. Partly inspired by theRussian Orthodox Mass, it is surprisingly Christian in its s ymbology, and there is nothing obscene about it despite what certain detractors may say. In fact,it is reminiscent of W agner’s Parsifal with its r epeated r eferences to“lance” and “Gr ail,” which ar e its most suggestiv e elements. As in theChristian Mass, the Holy Spirit is invoked often. The most openly erotic elementin the mass occurs when the priestess disrobes for part of the ceremony.The Gnostic Mass is too long to reproduce here but may be found in its entiretyin Crowley’s book, Magick. It is also r eprinted in section IV of Gems from theEquinox, edited by Israel Regardie, and The Equinox vol. III, no. 10, as well asvarious locations on the internet. It w ould ha ve been inter esting to see whatCr owley and the OTO would ha ve done with the Gnostic Libr ary disco vered atNag Hammadi by Egyptian Bedouins in 1945, two years before Crowley’s death.However, the library was not published until 1978; thus , the Mass was notinfluenced by any of its previously unknown texts.Originally intended by Crowley as the central ceremony of the OTO, both publicand priv ate, the Gnostic Mass is a rite conducted toda y by the EcclesiaGnostica Catholica (“ECG”—the Gnostic Catholic Church) and celebr ated regularlyin major cities ar ound the w orld. Evidently, visitors are usually welcome,provided they are willing to partake of the gnostic eucharist. The EGC is areligious body whose history and structure overlap that of the OTO.Parsons became inv olved with the OTO when an unkno wn scientific colleague tookthe r ocketeer to a meeting at Smith’ s house in Hollywood, after which Parsonsand his wife, Helen, began attending the various meetings of the lodge, as wellas the weekly performance of the Gnostic Mass . The “Chur ch of Thelema,” whichSmith had incorporated for this purpose, used the Gnostic Mass as a r ecruitingground for the OTO.In the OTO Parsons had found a ne w outlet for his r omantic notions. By day hewas a student of the ph ysical sciences; by night, of the occult sciences. InAnalysis By A Master of the Temple he wrote of his first impressions of Smith:“The alternate repulsion and attraction you felt the fir st year after meeting[Smith] w ere caused b y a subconscious r esistance against the or deals ahead.Had y ou had these experiences before, without such r esistance, you would havebecome hopelessly unbalanced.” The 25-year-old Parsons eventually discovered inSmith what Malina had found in v on Kármán: a father figure who could act asmentor to his hungry intellect, something Parsons had been sear ching for sincethe death of his gr andfather eight years earlier—indeed, since he was oldenough to hear the tales of how wicked his real father had been.

ItsGerman name is Orientalischer Templer-Orden (Oriental Order of Templars), andthere is purportedly a secr et meaning to the letter s “ OTO” as w ell. Theoccultic or der’s highest gr ades ar e said to inv olve w orking with “tantric”exercises, usually referred to as sex magic.Publicly the Ordo Templi Orientis claims descent from some of the great heretical mo vements such as the Ba varian Illuminati, the Rosicrucians, theAlbigensians and Cathars, the Knights Templar, and various early gnostic sects.These claims are very helpful, for they aid in placing the OTO within a properhistorical context, as we can guess much about it fr om its spiritual forebears. However, it is also desirable to learn about the secular origins of theOTO as well.The Or der tr aces its modern origins to tw o men: Carl K ellner and TheodorReuss (pronounced “Royce”). Kellner, born September 1, 185 1, was a wealthyAustrian industrialist who had made a good bit of mone y as a paper chemist.Reuss was born June 28, 1855 in Augsburg, Germany, about 15 miles northwest ofMunich. Both men were born not long after the German Revolution of 1848, andthus lived in a world of Prussian military expansion. Borders changed oftenduring their lifetimes . At various points throughout the men’s lives, Austriaand Germany were intermittently a part of Prussia, then a major western power.Reuss became a Mason in 1876, and w as also a singer, journalist and possible spy for the Prussian police . It is alleged that he infil-trated the SocialistLeague founded by Karl Marx’s daughter and her husband. It is inter esting tonote ho w many famous occultists ar e said to have had connections withintelligence organizations, the military, and the police , such as R euss,Crowley, Parsons, John Dee , Grady McMurtry, Anton LaVey, Michael Aquino, toname a few.Reuss was also w orking on a r evival of the Ba varian Illuminati, dispersednearly 1 00 y ears earlier, and w as at the same time the Grand Master of the Swedenborgian Rite in German y, as w ell as a Magus of the Societas Rosicruciana(“Rosicrucian Society”).Kellner was an initiate of the influential Hermetic Br otherhood of Light (HBL),founded by P.B. Randolph around 1870. The history of the HBL is not germane toour story , but its rites included sacr ed applications of sexual energy, andCrowley names the HBL in writing as the sour ce of the OTO’s “secret,” which isse xual in natur e. The reader desiring mor e information on the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light is directed to Allen Greenfield’s published history of theorder, listed in the bibliography herein.Kellner was also a high-r anking Freemason and a student of the Easternmysteries. In the 1890s , Kellner claimed to ha ve met thr ee adepts from theEast. One was a Sufi, Soliman ben Aifa, and the other two were Hindu tantrik as,Bhima Sena Pr atapa of Lahor e, and Sri Mahatma Agamya Paramahamsa. After theirmeeting, Kellner alleged he had found a “K ey” (German: Schlüssel) to “the Mysteries,” the heart of esoteric rites.The word KEY turns up so many times in the telling of this tale that it remindsone of the pulp publisher Ray Palmer, who always said he had a FACT which provedthe validity of Richard Shaver’s wild Dero tales. It’s as if the word itself hasa hidden meaning. Kellner’s Key, of course, was sex magic; perhaps theimplication w as key-in-lock sexual symbolism.In 1895, Kellner proposed to Reuss that they disseminate this newfound Key through an or ganized masonic rite . K ellner planned a reformation of the HermeticBr otherhood of Light in German y, a series of three degrees that would be openonly to the highest-r anking masons. Reuss used his masonic connections toacquire the 90th and 96th degrees of the Ancient and Primitiv e Rite of Memphisand Mizraim, and the 33r d degree of the Ancient and A ccepted Scottish Rite,from John Yarker, a masonic historian in England. Despite its initialassociation, the OTO eventually retreated from Masonry, beginning with Crowley,who abandoned any claim to “make” Masons.One of the K ellner-Reuss Or der’s platforms w as the Swedenborgian Rite , namedfor the S wedish m ystic Immanuel Swedenborg, which w as used for the fir stthree “Craft” degrees of Freemasonry (Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, andMaster Mason), with the other, higher degrees serving as a vehicle fordissemination of the Key. Things seem to have been finalized somewhat within theOrder in 190 2, at which time the Memphis-Mizr aim degr ees were acquired.Initiations began, but students who adv anced were often shocked at the revelation of the K ey; other s r eportedly found it absurd, and man y left theas-y et unnamed or der. Occultist F ranz Hartmann (1838-1912) was one earlymember who left, ar ound the time the order began calling itself “ OTO.”On June 7, 190 5, K ellner, no w kno wn as F rater R enatus, died. Reuss, whohad already taken the lead role, was fully in charge now, and it was apparentlyhe who chose the name Or do Templi Orientis, since the appellation e videntlydid not e xist before 1905. As to the significance of the name, the east(Orientis), of cour se, is where the sun rises, and is also where Kellner foundhis Key.Within this body of adepts , R euss w as kno wn v ariously as “Merlin” and“Peregrinus,” and it w as he who set up the 1 0-degree structure of the OTO thatremains in place today. He also wrote various rituals for each degr ee, but mostof these ar e no longer in use , having been replaced by those of Crowley.Several famous occultists were chartered by Reuss to operate OTO lodges,including R udolf Steiner (186 1-1925), founder of Anthroposophy, who w ascharter ed for a German lodge in 1906, although some of his spiritualdescendants pr efer to ignore this fact today. Dr. Gerard Encausse (1865-1916),better known as Papus, was chartered in France in 1908. The absorption of theEcclesia Gnostica Catholica formed another link betw een the P apus lineage andthe modern OTO.A Dr. Arnold Krumm-Heller (1879-1949), also known by the Aztec name Huir acocha,w as charter ed for all of Latin America, but he never took the Order anyfurther there and it seems to have died out. The use of Aztec names is still apractice among well-to-do Mexicans today.Aleister Crowley joined the OTO in 1910, thinking it w as just one of many otherEastern masonic lodges . He seems to ha ve collected degrees fr om initiatingbodies lik e some people collect postage stamps, and had been initiated all thew ay to the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite in Mexico some 10 years earlier. Hehad also been initiated into the 90th and 95th degrees of the Memphis-MizraimRite by the same John Yarker who had giv en the 90th and 96th degr ees of thatrite to Reuss. The OTO was just another order like any other—or so Crowleythought.The famous story concerning Cr owley’s initiation into the higher mysteries ofthe order goes like this: Crowley’s Book of Lies was published in 1912, at whichtime he was an honorary VII° member of the OTO (and rather disappointed about itat that). After reading the book, Reuss appr oached Cr owley angrily , accusingthe latter of ha ving revealed the secr et of the highest degr ee of the Or der,i.e ., the IX°. Reuss stated that Cr owley would be compelled to be initiatedinto that degree immediately, and thus sworn to secrecy.16[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-16]Crowley denied the allegation, so Reuss pointed out the offending passage tohim. Crowley would say that he instantaneously knew the answer to all the mysteries, the m ysteries of the OTO and of man y other spiritual traditions aswell: He had the Key.It is unclear what chapter of Crowley’s book contained the passage that hadriled Reuss. Robert Anton Wilson, popular author and writer of our introduction,says in Cosmic Trigger that it was chapter 69, but the most likely candidateappears to be chapter 36, the Star Sapphire, which is named in Crowley’s De ArteMagica as containing the secret of the OTO. In r eading some of the otherchapter s (15, e .g.) in The Book of Lies, it is difficult to believe thatCrowley did not at least suspect the Key before his meeting with Reuss.Regardless, Crowley was given the IX° in 1912, and the entir e written corpus ofthe Or der was at his disposal. He w ould soon r ewrite almost everything withinit to bring it into line with his o wn magical discoveries. On April 21, 1912,Crowley was given the X° and authority over the entire British Isles. His ownmagical record says he learned the Key in June of that y ear, in actuality a reference to when he tr anslated the documents from German into English. In 1916, Crowley appointed Charles Stansfeld Jones, whom we have already met asFrater Achad, to be his Viceroy to North America. Jones’ X° name was Parzival.On May 10, 1921, Reuss chartered Jones as Head of the OTO for North America, butCrowley overturned this action after succeeding R euss.Too many other charters and degrees were granted by the OTO to relate here. Oneof interest, although not part of our story, was to H. Spencer Lewis, founder ofthe Ancient and Mystical Order of the Rosy Cross (A.M.O.R.C.), i.e., “theRosicrucians.” Lewis was given a document referred to as a “Gage of Amity” in192 1, and his mail-or der mystery school San Jose , California, still thriv estoda y, e vidently without possessing the Key.In 1917, Cr owley rewrote the OTO degrees again, especially the lower ones,removing most of the masonic material and r eplacing it with thelema (explainedbelow). Reuss was in agreement, but other lodges would not be . In 192 0, R eusstranslated Crowley’s Gnostic Mass into German and began to tr anslate Liber ALas well, until he had a stroke in the spring of that year. Crowley then assumedan acting role as head of the OTO until November 27, 1921, at which time heproclaimed himself “Outer Head of the Order.” Jones and another X° initiate,Heinrich T ranker of the German Pansophia group, confirmed his position. Reussdied on October 28, 1923.There were other orders that, although not a part of the OTO, were officiallyassociated with it, man y of which w ere not pr epared to accept thelema when itwas finally revealed to them by Crowley at a German conference in 1925. Readersinterested in the histories of the various orders and br eakaway groups arereferred to The Equinox, vol. III, no. 10, and the various online histories ofthe Order.As noted, in 19 14 the A gape Lodge had been founded in Vancouver by Jones, AKAAchad/Parzival, under Crowley’s authority. Crowley visited the lodge in 19 15,at which time he met Wilfr ed Smith, who had been a charter member of the AgapeLodge. The two got along well at that point.Fifteen years later, in 1930, Crowley sent Smith to Los Angeles with the expressintent of opening another lodge , also to be called A gape Lodge. The lodge wasincorporated April 4, 1934, and its first meeting was held on September 21, 1935in Hollyw ood. Smith was appointed as “Head” for the United States, for whichoffice he bore the X° name “Ramaka.”In 1941, Grady McMurtry (October 18, 1918-July 12, 1985) was first initiatedinto the OTO by Wilfred Smith at Agape Lodge No. 2. In 1943, Crowley gr antedMcMurtry the IX° and the magical motto of “Hymenaeus Alpha,” in England, wher ethe latter w as stationed during the war. McMurtry worked with Army Ordnanceduring World War II, served in Korea and retired a major. Today he is betterremembered as the second Caliph of the OTO, while Karl Germer was the firstCaliph, though he ne ver used that term. The thir d Caliph, Hymenaeus Beta, hasbeen Outer Head of the Order since McMurtry’s death in 1985.The gr ades of the Or do T empli Orientis ha ve r ather inv olved names and echothe grades of various masonic rites, as well as those of the BavarianIlluminati. They are:0.MinervalI.Man & BrotherII.MagicianIII.Master MagicianIV.Companion of the RoyalArch of EnochV.Sovereign Prince of Rose Croix, Knight of the Pelican &EagleVI.Illustrious Knight Templar of the Order of Kadosh & Supreme Companion ofthe Holy GrailVII.Very Illustrious Sovereign Grand Inspector GeneralVIII.PerfectPontiff of the Illuminati, Epopt of the IlluminatiIX.Initiate of the Sanctuaryof the GnosisX.Rex Summus Sanctissimus, Supreme & Most Holy King The first three grades are open to all who request them and correspond roughlyto the “nur sery” gr ades of the Illuminati. The fiv e lower grades correspondto the “ chakras,” i.e., yogic/tantric energy centers, as well as to the“naked-eye” planets. Higher degrees are by invitation only. Most people aresurprised to learn the VII° requires a vow of chastity. There is also an XI°that is not part of the formal structure but was developed by Crowley.As noted, Crowley rewrote the OTO degrees, replacing the masonic material withwhat he called “thelema.” Thelema is the Gr eek for “will,” a word important inthe w ork of Aleister Crowley for several reasons. In 1904, Cr owley “received”The Book of the La w, technically called Liber AL vel Legis , through themediumship of his fir st wife, Rose Kelly, while the couple was in Cairocelebrating their honeymoon. The book was allegedly dictated by a discarnateentity calling himself Aiwass, also spelled Aiwaz before Crowley changed it fornumerological reasons.One of the precepts contained in The Book of the Law (abbreviated “AL”) is, “Dowhat thou wilt shall be the whole of the la w” (see AL III:13). Its oft-citedcomplement is, “Love is the law, love under will.” These two precepts arestandard salutations for members of the OTO even toda y. The w ords for “will”and “lo ve” in Gr eek—thelema (θεληµα) and agape (αγαπη), respectively—each havenumerical values of 93, a number important in Crowley’s system of magick.These phrases carry with them a great duty to live deliberately, to find one’sTrue Will and then do it and nothing else. Outsiders often interpret them asinvitations to “free love,” but that definition is not necessarily so. Ho wever,the w ord agape is a r eference not only to “charitable love” but also to the“lo ve feasts” of the second-century Christians, especially as interpreted bythe Christian Gnostics, which did include a se xual meaning. The A gape Lodge was not called “Agape” for nothing.A R osicrucian or der, the Golden Da wn—used as the basis for Crowley’s “ Astrum× Argenteum” magick al gr ading s ystem—was modeled more after the mysteryschools of the ancients, with the purpose of taking the candidate for initiationthr ough a series of m ystical exercises and ritual ceremonies.Around 1887, a manuscript in cipher was found in a bookstore by a Dr. Woodmanand/or Woodford. Woodman was a colleague of Dr . William Wynn Westcott, who inturn w as acquainted with Theodor Reuss. W oodman and W estcott called on Samuel“MacGr egor” Mathers to help them decipher it.The manuscript consisted of rituals and analy ses of the T arot cards, as w ellas the addr ess of a F räulein Spr engel in Nur emberg, Germany. Upon beingcontacted by them, Anna Sprengel, as “Sapiens Dominabitur Astris” [Wise Mistressof the Stars?], sent the three men a charter for a ne w lodge in England: theIsis-Ur ania Lodge of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Da wn, which opened onMar ch 2 0, 1888. All thr ee w ere charter ed at the 7°= 4 degree, “ AdeptusExemptus,” and soon opened other lodges ar ound the British Isles . The GoldenDawn seems to have had a surprisingly large network.According to the foundation m yth, Sprengel died soon after, and her r emainingGerman colleagues allegedly withdr ew all support from the English lodge; however, as it turns out, the y never really existed. The English were on theirown for now, but they felt assured that they had already received sufficientinformation to place them in contact with the mysterious “Secret Chiefs” of theOrder.Subsequently W oodman died, and in 1897 W estcott stepped down. Mathers beganclaiming to ha ve made contact with thr ee of the Secret Chiefs, a doubtfulassertion. Mather s also soon started to work on his greatest achievement, thetranslation of The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage , which he hadfound in manuscript in a Paris library, the Bibliotheque l’Arsenal. Thisdocument explains how one may attain to the “Knowledge and Conversation of theHoly Guardian Angel.”Crowley w as initiated into the Or der of the Golden Da wn on November 18, 1898,at the age of 23. This was his first initiation, and he took it with allseriousness. Many famous writers were also members of the Golden Dawn: ArthurEdward Waite, William Butler Yeats, and Arthur Machen, to name a fe w. OscarWilde’ s wife Constance was a member, as was Yeats’ mistress Florence Farr, anactress who was also the mistress of George Bernard Shaw.The degr ee s ystem of the Golden Da wn w as later adapted b y Crowley for theA∴A∴ and consisted of thr ee different schools or orders: the gr ades 1 thr ough4 in the Or der of the Golden Da wn proper; the gr ades 5 thr ough 7 in the Order of the R osy Cross (a Rosicrucian reference); and the gr ades 8 through 10in the Or der of the Silver Star.The grades from 0 to 10 respectively are:Probationer 0°=0Neophyte 1°=10Zelator 2°=9Practicus 3°=8Philosophus 4°=7Adeptus Minor 5°=6Adeptus Major 6°=5Adeptus Exemptus 7°=4Magister Templi 8°=3Magus 9°=2Ipsissimus 10°=1Crowley adv anced thr ough the lo wer gr ades pr omptly, and w as overall quitepleased with the Or der, becoming an “ adept,” as he moved from the lower gradesinto the Order of the Rosy Cross.The idea of the pr ogression through grades in the Golden Da wn was seen mor eas a teaching tool, some what like the Scottish Rite degrees of the Freemasons.A broad, religious order modeled after the Rosicrucians, the Golden Dawn, andsubsequently Crowley’s A∴A∴, are designed to bring the student to full spiritualpotential in all areas.The OTO, on the other hand, was conceived as a specialized rite to convey theKey that Kellner had discovered in the East. It then gr ew into a quasi-masonicinitiating body , though the lo wer grades were initially granted honorarily toMasons in good standing with other lodges, and w ould subsequently be“de-masonized” b y Cr owley. Unlike the OTO, the focus of the Golden Da wn w asnot se xual in nature, although Crowley later used sex magic for the purposes ofhis own continued self-initiation.As early as 1899, ther e was already dissent in the Golden Da wn, and in 1900Arthur E.W aite left to found his o wn or der. Another member br oke a way laterto form the Stella Matutina (“Morning Star”). In addition, Mathers had beencaught in his lie with Westcott regarding the e xistence of the Germans , andall the inner turmoil broke up the remaining order quite quickly, a developmentCrowley attributed to occult forces coming down on Mathers in retribution forhis having publishing the Abramelin book. The other members were angry forMather s having initiated Cr owley into the 5°=6 degree, Adeptus Minor, for avariety of reasons. The two had to left the country to do this initiation, traveling to Mather s’ home in Paris, where Mathers conferred the grade uponCrowley, during January 1900.Crowley initially supported Mathers but could not do so forever, as Mathers slidfurther and further into madness. A lawsuit ensued, and Mathers declared incourt that he w as one of the mysterious “Secret Chiefs,” an affair Crowleyparodied quite humorously. The parody is reproduced in The Aleister CrowleyScrapbook by Sandy Robertson.Crowley pur sued his Golden Da wn w ork independently , later admitting othermembers under the aegis of the A∴A∴, but he would eventually openly claim all ofthe 10 degrees of the Order.It w as into this str ange, esoteric and occult w orld that John Parsons steppedthat fateful day when he received from Rypinski his first Crowley composition.This enigmatic fusion of “sex and rockets” was to pr ove a fascinating development in the history of the aer ospace industry in America. The Parsons invention, the solid fuel JATO cannister, now displayed at theSmithsonian.009 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_009_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"fourParsons’ Double Life: 1940-1942In 1940, the editor of Astronautics magazine compiled quotes fr om famous peopleunder the heading “What They Think About Rockets,” a few of which are worthexcerpting here, as they indicate that, lik e John Parsons, even some of the“big thinkers” were looking to the star s. For example, the Secretary of theSmithsonian Institution, Dr. C.G. Abbot, stated:A few hundr ed thousand dollars invested today in the scientific development ofrockets would pay the nation dividends amounting to hundreds of millions ofdollars in the next two decades.World-renowned pilot Charles Lindbergh opined:The rocket offers the only known possibility of sending instruments to altitudesabove those r eached by sounding balloons. Observations taken outside of the earth’s atmosphere or even in the higher levels of the atmosphere, would be ofimmense value in the study of such subjects as astr onomy, meteorology andterrestrial magnetism.And Dr . John O . Ste wart, Associate Pr ofessor of Astr onomical Physics,Princeton University, declared:With rockets speeds of 1000 miles per hour are possible by 1950. By 2050 arocket trip to the moon at 25,000 miles per hour is not impossible.Despite such open-mindedness in the w orld at lar ge, within the GALCIT group,all was not well, and Malina found reason to complain about Parsons and Formanagain in a letter of April 7, 1940. The complaint had nothing to do with Parsons’ ne wfound inter est in the occult, which Forman seems to have shared toa lesser degree. Malina had his o wn unorthodo xies, including communism.Malina’ s mind was on mor e mundane matter s. He wr ote, “Need a good physicist. Forman and Parsons are all right for some types of w ork, sometimesthey are like inventors, in the worst sense of the word.” This instance is the very last time Parsons is mentioned in an y of Malina’s letters home, except whenhis name appear s with the other s on a list of Aerojet founders. The breakbetween the two was complete, although Parsons may not have realized it. Parsonsremained with Forman, but Malina was with Summerfield, who joined the group thatJuly. Later, Forman’s widow would relate that her husband and Parsons thoughtMalina was unnecessarily “cold and arrogant” toward them.In August 1940, Popular Mechanics devoted six pages to the work of Parsons and Forman in an article entitled, “Seeking P ower for Space Rockets,” which isinformativ e and w ell-illustrated. Malina is also mentioned but not pictured. Ashorter article, “New Experiments with Rockets,” appeared the following month inPopular Science and is also w ell-illustrated but ends with a discussion of thew ork of Robert Goddard and the potential military applications for r ockets.They ar e r eproduced in the pages that follo w. Only P arsons and Forman arefeatured, which speaks well to their level of involvement at this time. WhileMalina was head of the project in name by virtue of his status at Caltech,Parsons and Forman were the ones doing the dirty work.Also in 1940, the United States started sending ammunition and supplies toEngland, embar going Japan. Pr esident Franklin Delano Roosevelt and hisCongress increased defense spending 800%, fr om $1.9 billion to $17 billion. Von Kármán began making fr equent trips to Washington, D.C, trips that w ouldcontinue thr oughout the w ar. The city of Pasadena had 13,300 people working inthe aircraft industry that year, a figure that may sound like a lot, but by thenext year—after the United States entered the war—it had increased to 113,000.In order to r ecruit so man y workers, Boy Scouts w ere hired to distribute jobapplications door-to-door.In that year, von Kármán and Malina demonstrated on paper the feasibility oflong-dur ation burns in a confined space such as a rocket motor casing, aprocedure that von Kármán later listed as the first critical step in thedevelopment of rockets in the United States. As a result, the National Academyof Sciences immediately doubled the GALCIT group’s budget for 194 1, to $22,000.This action infuriated Goddard, working alone in Roswell, as he didn’tappreciate the young upstarts getting all the funding and attention. His decadesof work were indeed unappreciated by the world, mainly due to self-imposedisolation. Malina, Parsons and Forman shared the byline on their feasibilitypaper, entitled, “Air Corps Jet Pr opulsion Research, Final Report for 1939-40,”a cop y of which is on file in the JPL archives.010 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_010_r1.gif] Both John Parsons and Ed For man prominently appear in this August 1940 PopularMechanics feature; John wearing black leather jacket and black suit jacket, andEd clad in white.011 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_011_r1.gif]012 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_012_r1.gif]013 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_013_r1.gif]014 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_014_r1.gif]015 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_015_r1.gif]At this time, Parsons received recognition and accolades not only in theaerospace industry but also in his personal life. One of the people in P arsons’new esoteric cir cle of friends w as the actr ess Jane Wolfe, who had appearedin the silent films , The Woman Next Door (1919), Men, Women and Money (1919),and Behold My Wife (1920). Wolfe, who had chosen the magical name Soror Estai,had been with Crowley at Cefalu (his “ Abbey of Thelema” in Italy) befor ecoming back to California and the A gape Lodge, when Mussolini closed the Abbey.After her return she does not appear in any of the film guides. Adding to theParsons’ legend, Wolfe recorded her first impression of him in her “magicalrecord” for December 1940:Unknown to me, John Whiteside Parsons, a newcomer , began astral travels. Thisknowledge decided Regina [Kahl] to under take similar work. All of which I learned after making my own decision. So the time must be propitious.Incidentally, I take Jack Parsons to be the child who “shall behold them all”[i.e., the Mysteries of The Book of the Law . See AL I:54-56, below].26 years of age, 6′2”, vital, potentially bisexual at the very least, Universityof the State of Califor nia and Cal Tech., now engaged in Cal Tech chemicallaboratories developing “bigger and better” explosives for Uncle Sam. T ravelsunder sealed orders from the government. Writes poetr y—“sensuous only,” hesays. Lover of music, which he seems to know thor oughly. I see him as the r ealsuccessor of Therion [Crowley]. Passionate; and has made the vilest analyses result in a species of exaltation after the event. Has had mystical experienceswhich gave him a sense of equality all r ound, although he is hierarchical infeeling and in the established order.The passage in Cr owley’s The Book of the Law to which Wolfe refers (AL I:54-56)reads, “Change not as much as the style of a letter; for behold! Thou, oprophet, shalt not behold all these mysteries hidden therein. The child of thybowels, he shall behold them. Expect him not from the East, nor from the West;for from no expected house cometh that child.” A t 26, Parsons was still a “child” in the e yes of the older members, at least in the spiritual sense,regarded by Wolfe as this “chosen one,” so to speak.Parsons’ “mystical experiences,” if they were recorded then, have since beenlost and ar e unknown. For sake of comparison to Wolfe’s portrayal, Parsons’ FBIfile describes him as 6 ′1”, 185 pounds , with brown hair and brown eyes, mediumbuild, and fair complexion. The remark “potentially bisexual at the very least”may refer to his admitted attraction to Smith, as well as to another uniquecharacteristic: at least two former work associates have said that Parsonssweated profusely, which caused str ong body odor that he tried to mask withheavy cologne. A man who wore a lot of cologne at the same time that hedisplayed an above-average interest in another man may have inadvertently giv enthe impr ession of bise xuality. Parsons himself once expressed a latenthomosexuality, and Aleister Crowley, Parsons’ new idol, was well known for hisbisexuality.Like many other A gape Lodge member s, Wolfe was also in the A∴A∴. Crowley hadinitiated her at Cefalu as a Probationer 0°=0 on June 11, 1921, and had furtherrecognized her as a Neophyte 1°=10 in May 1940, after she had written him tolament her long term as a Probationer.Wolfe was not the last to identify P arsons’ potential. After mor e than a y earof attending meetings and the Gnostic Mass , John and Helen Parsons joined the Agape Lodge on F ebruary 15, 194 1, when they simultaneously joined the A ∴A∴.Just a fe w weeks after the y joined, in March 1941, Smith wrote to Crowley, “Ithink I have at long last a really excellent man, John P arsons. And starting next Tuesday he begins a course of talks with a view to enlarging our scope. Hehas an excellent mind and much better intellect than m yself . . . John Parsonsis going to be v aluable.”Parsons became “F rater T .O.P.A.N.” and w as known as “F rater 210” for short.His wife became “Sor or Grimaud.” The initials in Parsons’ magical motto stoodfor Thelemum Obtentum Pr ocedero Amoris Nuptiae , Latin for “the obtainment ofthelema—Will—through the nuptials of love.” The initials T.O.P.A.N. were also adeclaration of Parsons’ dedication: To Pan. In Hebrew the enumeration for T.O.P.A.N. is 400+7 0+80+1+50=601. P arsons counted it as I.O.P.A.N., giving themor e desirable sum 2 10, with “Io P an” being Greek for “Hail P an.” Indeed, Crowley’s “Hymn to P an,” which Parsons had memorized and often recited, begins,“Io Pan! Io Pan Pan!”The numbers 1 through 20 add to 210. In the book 777 Cr owley also speaks ofcertain number s important to each of the sephiroth (spheres) of the kabbalistic Tree of Life. The fir st has the v alue 1, the second 1+2 =3, thethir d 1+2+3=6, and so on; ther e are 10 altogether. Although Cr owley does notsa y so, a little quick math will show these 10 values add to 210. In 777Crowley calls the meaning of 210 “too holy” to divulge, an allusion to the“N.O.X. formula.” N.O.X., Latin for “night,” is akin to “L.V.X.” or “Lux”—light.Both are portrayed during simple rituals of Cr owley’s that came fr om theGolden Dawn.Coincidentally, the inter state highway running through Pasadena which makes a90-degr ee turn due north of the beginning of South Orange Grove Ave., headingstr aight to JPL, is numbered 210, as if some cosmic force numbered the highwayin Parsons’ honor.Helen’s chosen name, Grimaud, is a French name that ma y refer to a character inone of Lor d Bulwer-Lytton’s novels who acted as a “magical servitor.”Bulwer-Lytton is probably most famous for ha v-ing started a novel with thephrase, “It was a dark and stormy night.”Eventually, Parsons came to vie w Smith as the father he alw ays wanted, and thetw o stayed in touch thr oughout their liv es, despite the many problems betweenthem and with other member s of the lodge. While man y member s of the A gapeLodge drifted apart, Parsons and Smith continually came back to each other ,and, although Parsons called Crowley “Father” in his many letters to him, theimmediate presence of Smith was much more powerful.In addition, P arsons’ inter est in science fiction continued into adulthood,and he attended many of the weekly meetings of the Los Angeles Science F antasySociety ( LASFS), which met Thur sday evenings. LASFS started as chapter 4 ofthe Science Fiction League , one of many fan clubs begun in 1934 when HugoGernsback’ s magazine Wonder Stories announced the ne w program. All closed butchapter 4, which r emained a vital concern due to the w ork of one man—ForrestJ. A ckerman. A ckerman has said that he r emembers meeting Parsons once, thoughothers insist he must have met him on many occasions. Helen Parsons Smithremembers at least one meeting.In 1940, Ackerman’s group became the independent LASFS, which, as home base forLos Angeles-area fans and writers, was quite active. JPL archivist John Bluthhear d that man y science fiction people fr e-quented Parsons’ house, but it wasless common for Parsons to go to the LASFS. He was thus probably not a member,just an attendee.At one of the Thursday meetings in 194 1, Parsons met one of his favorite authors, Jack Williamson, who r ecords this meeting in Wonder’s Child, his autobiography. Williamson had written Darker Than You Think, which first appeared in themagazine Unknown in 1940, and was expanded considerably in 1948 for the bookedition. In Wonder’s Child, Williamson wr ote, “He [P arsons] had r ead m ynovel Darker Than You Think, which deals with the supernatur al. I wasastonished to discover he had a far less skeptical interest in such things thanI.” Nonetheless , it w as Williamson’ s fa vorite story as well, and heidentified with the main char acter, Will Barbee, who is horrified to disco verhe is really a werewolf, but gradually learns to accept his newfound powers.Williamson subsequently w ent to P arsons’ house for one of the Sunday afternoonmeetings of fans and writer s that P arsons sponsored every week. He recordedthe event in Wonder’s Child:I met John Parsons. An odd enigma to me, he was a r ocket engineer withunexpected leanings towar d the occult. He wanted to meet me because I’d writtenDarker Than You Think—a good many people have taken it mor e seriously than Iever did; witches now and then have taken me for a fellow Wiccan.Parsons belonged to the OTO, an underground order founded, I think, by thesatanist Aleister Crowley. One night Cleve Cartmill and I were allowed to climbafter him into an attic to attend a secr et meeting. The ritual wasdisappointingly tame. Ther e was no nude virgin on the altar. Satan was notinvoked.Yet the priest impressed me. He was a lean, dynamic little man with bright,light blue eyes, driven by a vir ulent hatred of God. Talking to him after theceremony, I found that he was the son of a British clergyman who must have beenthe r eal target of that savage animosity.From the above description it sounds as if Williamson got to meet Wilfred Smith.Darker Than You Think is the story of her editary werewolves who have discoveredtheir true bestial nature and seek to revive the old ways and the old gods. Theyaccomplish this revival under the leadership of the “Child of Night,” who is ther esult of a magical pr odigious birth, finding him in the char acter of WillBarbee . Williamson’s first science fiction treatment of werewolves (a novelapproach at the time) had been in 1932, when he wrote the short story, “Wolvesof Darkness.”The connection to Wicca and neo-paganism is obvious , as is the parallel toParsons’ magical “Babalon W orking,” which will be the subject of chapter s 7and 8. Darker Than You Think is even listed under “R eligion and Myths” in TheVisual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. Williamson’ s book e vidently influencedP arsons’ writing, such as follo ws, which sounds lik e a fair s ynopsis ofDarker Than You Think:To go deep you must r eject each phenomenon, each illumination, each ecstasy,going ever downward, until you reach the last avatars of the symbols that arealso the racial archetypes.In this sacrifice to the abysmal gods is the apotheosis that transmutes them tothe beauty and power that is your eternity, and the redemption of mankind. Edd Cartier’s illustration for the 1948 Fantasy Pr ess edition of Darker ThanYou Think, Jack Williamson’s sci-fi novel John Parsons found extraordinarilyinspirational.016 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_016_r1.gif]Several other authors visited Parsons, including A.E. V an Vogt, as well asregulars like writer Alva Rogers and science fiction illustrator Lou Goldstone .Another possible visitor w as E. Hoffman Price, a would-be writer who knew mostof the people in the circle of H.P. Lovecraft, the famous fantasy and horrorwriter, as well as in much of science fiction fandom. Price later br agged of having introduced occult ideas to Lo vecraft, whose tr eatments of Theosophicalelements are well documented in his letters to Price, thus revealing that someof the material did indeed originate with the latter.Parsons also met a young Ray Bradbury, or, rather, Bradbury met Parsons. As Bradbury told me , “I only met him once , when I wa s a teenager and he came tolectur e at the Los Angeles Science F antasy Society in the late thirties . . .I w as merely part of a small audience of about 2 0 or 3 0 who w ere fascinatedwith his ideas about the future.”One other per son who P arsons met at the LASFS was Gr ady McMurtry, who laterbecame F rater Hymenaeus Alpha and was Karl Germer’s successor as Outer Head ofthe OTO, running the Order until his death in 1985.Much has been made of a connection betw een Robert Heinlein and Parsons, and ithas been said that Heinlein w as the fir st person to whom P arsons intr oducedhis second wife , Camer on. Parsons is also thought to ha ve corresponded withHeinlein after his leaving Hollyw ood; unfortunately, Mr s. Heinlein destroyedall of her husband’s correspondence from the period before they were married.However, Mr s. Heinlein and L. Spr ague de Camp ha ve maintained that Heinleindid not know Parsons, although Cameron asserted their meeting occurr ed and waslater covered up. Claims that Heinlein’ s Stranger in a Str ange Land wasinfluenced b y Parsons and thelema are left to the r eader’s judgement.017 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_017_r1.gif]018 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_018_r1.gif]019 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_019_r1.gif] Popular Science, in its September 1940 issue, plays up Parsons, Malina and Forman’s explosive experiments in the Ar royo Seco. The magazine’s captionmistakenly says that a Caltech photographer is Parsons, and neglects to mentionthe identity of a lone figure in a white shirt. He’s John Parsons.020 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_020_r1.gif]An essay in Rapid Eye #3 entitled “Whence Came the Str anger” seems to documenta definite r elationship betw een Heinlein and Parsons. In this essay, AdamRostoker wrote, “Parsons and Heinlein were quite close friends . The y may havemet at the Los Angeles Science Fiction Fan Club [Science Fantasy Society], whichmaintained a reading room . . . [They] were certainly seen there together.” In afootnote he related that Marjorie Cameron, Parsons’ second wife, was the sourceof this information: “Heinlein was the first person Parsons ever introduced herto. She didn’t care for Heinlein too much; he was ‘too slick, too Hollywood. ButJack and he were good friends.’” Adam Rostoker is the same “AdamWalks-Between-Worlds” of the Church of All Worlds which w as inspired byHeinlein’ s Stranger in a Str ange Land. He may have published a similar articlein that or ganization’s Green Egg magazine.Williamson documents science writer and member of the German Rocket SocietyWilly Le y’s occasional pr esence at meetings of the Mañana Literary Society, aninformal science fiction discussion group which met at Heinlein’s house, soParsons may have met his old correspondent there—assuming he was in fact a partof Heinlein’s circle.Meanwhile, in \\P arsons’ other life , the GALCIT group realized its first bigsuccess in August 1941. Parsons had come to realize that the rocket motors, nowcalled jet-assisted tak e-offs ( JATOs) to avoid the charged term “r ocket,” hadto be used almost immediately , as the y could not be stor ed for long periodsof time or in e xtremes of temperature. He and F orman w ould get up v ery earlyand pr epare the JATOs, nap a little, then meet the others at March Field. VonKármán wrote, “He [P arsons] used a paper-lined c ylinder into which he presseda black-po wder propellant of his o wn composition in one-inch layers.” InAugust, the group was ready to test Parsons’ JATOs on actual aircraft, the firsttime this type of rocket had ever been used.The fuel used was called GALCIT-27, implying 26 failures before it. The airplanechosen was a hobby plane called the “Ercoupe,” chosen because it was small,light and har d to stall. The pilot w as Captain Homer A. Boushe y, Jr. of theArmy Air Corps, a graduate student of von Kármán’ s. Also pr esent was anothergr aduate student, Homer Joe Stewart, to whom was addressed a signed copy ofFrank Malina’s memoirs in the possession of the JPL archives.The GALCIT-27 event was recorded on color film, a cop y of which resides in theLibr ary of Congr ess. The silent original, along with some outtakes, is in theJPL archives. Both the original and the outtakes feature Parsons sporting agoatee and small mustache .By this time Weld Arnold had been r eplaced as the gr oup’s photographer byGeorge Emerson, an Englishman, after whose arrival the quality of still photographs improved dramatically. Emerson stayed with JPL for 40 years as the lab’schief photographer, while Weld went to New York and, in the 1950s, ended up onthe Board of Trustees at the University of Nevada, where Malina found him. Thetw o corresponded until Weld’s death in 1961.Parsons w as right about using the JATOs immediately, and, on August 6, 1941,one week after some nerv e-wracking static tests in which the JATOs “ explodedlike the F ourth” 12 of the r ockets were mounted under the wings of the Ercoupe. The JATOs each deliv ered 28 pounds of thrust for 12 seconds—336 poundsthrust total. The group had never seen a plane climb so steeply The film clearlyshows the plane le veling off immediately when the JATOs’ fuel supply w asexhausted. The JATOs were a success, and Parsons was to credit.Some of the footage w as shot fr om the air , in Clark Millik an’s small plane .The gr ound footage sho wing the Er coupe taking off alongside Millik an’s planer eveals quite dr amatically the differ ence the JATOs made: Takeoff distancewas reduced over 30%. During one of the tests a nozzle shot off the end of aJATO, bounced off the runway, and tore a hole in the plane’ s fuselage near thetail. “ At least it wasn’t a big hole ,” one of the gr oup joked. Undaunted, thepilot Boushey continued flying. The tests also continued, running until August12.The JATOs were envisioned for use wher ever short run ways were constructed. Ifthe Army Air Corps were in some remote locale with rough terrain or lots of trees, a short run way would save the labor and expense of a lot of men. Thesecond use was for quick getaways in the air. If an enemy plane came up behind apilot who had JATOs, the latter could ignite the r ockets and get out of theenem y’s line of fire. Footage of this sort of maneuv er is also included in theA ugust 1941 film. Hap Arnold’s original idea to utilize the JATOs to helpoverloaded aircraft take off was not a part of the tests, though it was put touse during the w ar.On August 23, the propeller was then removed from the Er coupe to demonstrateflight under rocket power only, the hole covered with three safety banners thegroup found at the site. One banner in particular amused them: “ Ask yourself:what about tomorr ow if I meet with an accident toda y?” To gain sufficientspeed to get it off the ground, the Er coupe w as to wed b y a r ope connectedto R udolph Schott’s r ed pickup truck. As the truck acceler ated to 25 mph,Boushey held the rope in his hand as long as he could, then dropped it andignited the JATOs. It worked, and the success of the o verall Ercoupe flighttest earned the gr oup a contr act with the Na vy. Parsons’ and Malina’s writtenreport on the Ercoupe tests is in the JPL archives. Three patents for liquid fuel discoveries wer e finally awarded Parsons andMalina a full two years after Parsons died.021 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_021_r1.gif]022 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_022_r1.gif]023 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_023_r1.gif]An oft-r eproduced photo fr om the Er coupe tests hints at the change inrelationship between Parsons and Malina. V on Kármán is shown writing on thewing of the Er coupe (suggesting the shot w as staged), while Cly de Miller ,Clark Millik an, Martin Summerfield, Frank Malina, and Homer Boushe y look on.This photo is usually referred to as the “technical group.” Why was Summerfieldthere? His specialty was liquid-fuel rockets, and this w as a solid fuel test.And where was Parsons? He was always referred to as the “theor etician,” withForman being the mechanic. Parsons is in a separate photo, with the “flight testcr ew”: Fred Miller (an “ explosives technician”), Ed Forman, Malina, Boushey,and a couple of Air Force mechanics. If the technical crew photo had been acandid photo r ather than a publicity photo, Parsons would have appeared;Summerfield would not. A large group photo from the same tests includes HelenParsons, John’s first wife. (See photo section.)It is r eported that patents e xist in P arsons’ name on solid-fuel JATOs andthat he shar es them with Mark M. Mills , one of his assistants. Frank Malinawrote that only P arsons would have thought of abandoning black po wder and smokeless po wder for mor e e xotic solid fuels, which w as way out of Malina’ s andHsue-shen T sien’s league. It w as also P arsons’ idea to pour in one-inch thickla yers, from the bottom up, to contr ol the burn rate, a process that had notbeen done before.It has been said that P arsons held a total of se ven patents altogether, butthe thr ee I was able to find w ere for liquid-fuel r ockets, not solid. Ondispla y in the Smithsonian Institution’ s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., is a specimen of an early solid-fuel JATO. The unit’ s sparkplug is not for ignition but for an insulated pathw ay into the fuel mixtur e; rather than going to the expense of constructing something ne w, the gr oup justhad F orman drill and thr ead a hole the size of a spark plug into the end ofthe JATO. The plug already had a built-in porcelain insulator surrounding theconductor, and wires were attached to either end of it, so electricity could bedirected safely inside the casing to ignite the mixture.In early November 1941 one of their “bo ys,” as Malina put it, got drunk andstole a car at gunpoint fr om a young couple:He was a mechanic working with Jack, and it seems that he had gone to Parsons’house. They’d had a seance—what they wer e doing I don’t know—anyway [he] had agun and he found a car on the street that was parked nearby. There was a couplenecking in it. He forced them out at the point of the gun, took the car , droveto Hollywood, evidently not quite knowing what he was going to do. And then,after a cer tain amount of time, he dr ove back to Pasadena. When he ar rived atthe flagpole by the Colorado [A ve.] bridge, the police were waiting for him.Malina continued:I went to the jail to talk to the fellow and asked him what exactly made him doa stupid thing like that. Well, he was very vague and I couldn’t get anythingout of Parsons or Forman as to why this had happened . . . It then became quiteevident that whatever it was that Parsons and Forman were playing with hadcertain worrisome aspects.Hypnosis, perhaps? F orman never did join the A gape Lodge, but Parsons and he were v ery close and ma y easily ha ve been sharing Parsons’ occult endeavors.The individual was released into Malina’s custody, and the whole incident w askept quiet, simply because of the work going on at the school. W ar was imminent(the attack on Pearl Harbor was only a month away); there was no need to disruptCaltech’s work with an embarrassing detail like this.Meanwhile, at the lodge Parsons was becoming increasingly influ-ential. In Marchof 1942, Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley:I believe Jack Parsons—who is devoted to Wilfr ed [Smith]—to be the comingleader, with Wilfred in advisory capacity. I hope you two get together some day,although your present activities in England seem to have postponed the date ofyour coming to us [which never happened]. Jack, by the way , comes in thr oughsome inner experiences, but mostly , perhaps, through the world of science. Thatis, he was “sold on the Book of the Law” because it for etold Einstein,Heisenberg—whose work is not permitted in Russia—the quantum field folks, whosework is along the “factor infinite and unknown” lines [see Liber 49, v. 36],etc. Y ou two would have a whale of a lot to talk over. He and Helen are lock,stock and barrel for the Order.r.That same year, Parsons also made an intuitive leap that changed the future ofrocket motor technology. There are apocryphal stories concerning the inspiration for his idea, but P arsons seems to ha ve taken the truth with him to thegr ave. 40 years later Homer Boushey told an International Association of Aeronautics and Astr onautics (IAAA) group in Oslo that the idea had come toParsons while watching some r oofers apply hot asphalt. F rank Malina said thatP arsons knew of “Gr eek Fire,” a mixture of pitch and other elements which theancient Greeks used as flaming projectiles, hurling them at enemy ships during wars. However, Helen P arsons told an intervie wer the idea had originated withher.As early as 1928, Parsons and Forman had used glue as a binder to hold theirblack powder and aluminum oxide in their little rocket motors. In 1942 P arsonshad the idea to use liquid asphalt for this purpose. The asphalt w as heated,then the fuel and the o xidizer were mixed in, and the mixture was poureddirectly into the casing rather than an intermediate molding and allo wed tocool. Dubbed GALCIT-53, the mixture did not shrink and cr ack as had earliermixtures. 17 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-17] The new JATOs could bestored indefinitely, at either extreme of temperature, without the threat ofexplosion during use—and they could now be mass-pr oduced. After Parsons leftAerojet, it was discovered that a hollow could be created in the center of thehardened fuel to provide increased surface area and thus an increased burningrate. At first they used a simple c ylindrical shape, then later a star shape tofurther increase the surface area. This method was used in the Minuteman andPolaris missiles.Mark M. Mills and F red S. Miller assisted P arsons with his w ork on theGALCIT-53 JATOs, which delivered 2 00 pounds of thrust for eight seconds—a 476%impr ovement o ver GALCIT-27. P arsons invented the method of pouring theheated, liquefied pr opellant, which involved priming the empty casing fir stwith a little bit of the liquefied solution, letting it cool just enough tostart to har den, and then pouring the r emainder of the fuel inside . Thismethod is still used today on the solid fuel booster s used on the SpaceShuttle.Parsons also had the equally monumental idea to start using potassiumperchlorate as an o xidizer, instead of aluminum and others. Successful variations on this idea included use of ammonium perchlorate for the samepurpose. Potassium perchlorate was actually listed in the paper P arsons wroteat Antelope V alley for Halifax in 1937, but he did not comment on its potentialat the time . What brought him back to it in 1942 is unkno wn.These br eakthroughs led to the formation of the A erojet Corporation on March19, 1942, now one of the world’s largest manufacturers of r ockets. The founders w ere v on Kármán, Malina, Summerfield, Parsons, Forman, and v on Kármán’sattorney Andrew Haley. Parsons and F orman had the idea to get a sponsor or forma corporation; Malina w as the one who pr oposed the idea to v on Kármán. Eachput in $2 00, though Haley actually loaned all but v on Kármán their share.Haley ended up putting in $2500, with the understanding that the others wouldpay him back later. The five assigned all future patents to the compan y, andMalina and Hale y came up with the name A erojet. Parsons and Forman immediatelyleft GALCIT for Aerojet. The group still worked on projects together, withAerojet employees selling their services as consultants to GALCIT. The companygrew quickly.Haley seems to have been a hands-on kind of guy, as his interesting book,Rocketry and Space Exploration, contains several photos of him working directlywith various manufacturing efforts at A erojet. Often he worked in the office byday and in the plant by night.The group’s next big success w as with liquid JATOs. Parsons was still trying tofind a w ay to use r ed fuming nitric acid ( RFNA) as an oxidizer with fuelssuch as gasoline and benzene . RFNA was the chemical that had caused the lar gee xplosion—and the big mess—when the Suicide Squad w as just getting started atCaltech. Curr ent tests resulted in motor s that burned but pr oduced unevenburning which led to thr obbing, caused b y late ignition: The fuel did notbegin burning immediately on contact with RFNA. Martin Summerfield’s“instability of burning” la w is still used to describe this phenomenon.On a trip east, an acquaintance of Malina’ s suggested using aniline to helpcontrol the burn rate of the mixture and reduce the throbbing. On the tr ainride home , Malina suddenly r ealized that RFNA and aniline ought to beself-igniting without the gasoline or benzene. He wired Summerfield back in Pasadena, who arr anged a test with engineer Walter Powell and others. The eventwas recorded on film: a small crucible sits on the ground, while a hand reachesin, holding a long pole at the end of which is another small crucible . When thecontents of one w ere poured into the other, the mixtur e did indeed ignite intoa huge flame, and the group was on their way to the perfection of liquid-fuelrockets.With the help of attorne y D. Gordon Angus, Parsons and Malina filed thr eepatents on Ma y 8, 1943 for v arious elements of this process. Parsons’ name ison these patents because he insisted on working with RFNA despite what other ssaid about the fuel, a fact documented by Malina in his or al histories withJPL. Ironically, two of the thr ee patents w ere not gr anted until after Parsons’ death in 1952. The patent number s are 2,573,471 (“Reaction MotorOperable by Liquid Propellants and Method of Operating It,” patented October 30,195 1); 2,693,0 77 (a division of patent 2,573,47 1, patented November 2, 1954,but with seemingly little if any difference from the first patent); and 2,774,214 (“R ocket Propulsion Method,” patented December 18, 1956, which is basicallythe same pr oposal submitted under a different category).The group’s acid-aniline mix was used as late as the Titan missile, at whichtime it was abandoned in favor of liquid oxygen, which had had finally been mademanageable . [In an odd “ coincidence,” the Great Beast Aleister Crowleyreferred to himself as “Teitan,” which is the original Greek spelling of“Titan,” because it adds to 666 in Greek gematria, a form of numerology.]The flight test of the new liquid fuel occurred on April 15, 1942 at Muroc Fieldin Antelope Valley, site of today’s Edwards Air Force Base. Liquid JATOs werethe first Aerojet project. A Douglas A-20A was flown first to the Burbankairport for pr eparations, then to the test field for the liquid JATO tests. Theplane weighed 20,000 pounds, as much as several Ercoupes combined. Major P aulH. Dane of the Arm y Air Corps was the test pilot. Be verly F orman, Ed’ scousin, sat in back of the plane. His job was to release the fuel mixture at theappropriate time. Two 1000-pound thrust JATOs were mounted under the A-20A’swings, each with a 25-second burn time. They were designed by Summerfield withthe assistance of Walter B. Powell and Edward G. Croft, and had five times thepower of GALCIT-53, although solid fuel maintained its value.A long, silent color film (thr ee reels) exists of this e vent as well, locatedin the Library of Congress, as well as in the JPL archives. One excellent shotshows von Kármán, Malina, and Parsons walking side-by-side down the runway,discussing some issue about the tests: the three men who made r ocketryviable—the gr eat man, v on Kármán, on one side, his protégé Malina in themiddle, acting as go-between, and the man of the w orld, John P arsons, on theother side . These same three men later appear ed in the same or der on v onKármán’s list of the top 1 0 people who had made American r ocketry apossibility, occupying the first three positions.Take-off distance was again reduced in excess of 30%. At the end of the tests,Malina said, “We now have something that really works and w e should be able tohelp giv e the Fascists hell!” V on Kármán called the de velopment “thebeginning of pr actical r ocketry in the United States .” The success of theA20-A test earned the gr oup another budget increase—from $125,000 in 1942 toseveral times that amount for the coming year, an incredible amount for the work of a few men. However, it was only one area into which the military waschanneling lar ge amounts of mone y in pr eparation for the w ar. DesignatedXLR-1-AJ-1, over 1 00 slightly modified liquid JATO units were sold by Aerojetfor use on Boeing B36 bombers during the w ar. Smaller units were also used tohelp launch Corsairs from aircraft carriers; it is unclear whether they usedliquid or solid fuel.Observing the tests w as Alfred Loedding, sent b y the Arm y Air Corps fromWright Field. Loedding’s later claim to fame w as as the military’s first UFOinvestigator in 1947: he started Project Sign, which sought to explain away allUFO reports and was the precursor to the Air Force’s better-known Project BlueBook.At Aerojet P arsons mostly w orked in solid fuels and w as the Project Engineerin charge of the Solid Fuels Department, although he wasn’t actually a degreedengineer. Forman supervised the mechanics’ shop and often went to the arroyo atGALCIT to perform static tests of his improved motors. Malina was working mostlywith liquids at this time, which was his friend Summerfield’ s specialty. Whenhe would visit the arroyo for tests, he would work out of his car.Aerojet’s first contract was for a solid JATO for the Navy Bureau ofAeronautics, and their second w as a liquid JATO for the Air craft Laboratory atWright Field that was used on the Douglas Havoc Attack Bomber. The originalAerojet offices were located on E. Colorado Ave. in Pasadena, but they soonmoved to 285 W. Colorado Ave., the site of a former juice v endor. T est and production facilities mo ved to Azusa the following year, about 40 miles east ofLos Angeles . A picture of the gr oundbreaking appear s in Hale y’s Rocketry andSpace Exploration. The Defense Plan Corporation paid $149,000 to build the plantafter some of von Kármán’s friends in Washington got involved. Aerojet’s thir dcontr act w as with the Air F orce, which committed $256,000 for solid-fuelJATOs.The ne w w ork at A erojet pr ovided plenty of opportunity for evening andweekend work, and uncompensated overtime was a fact of life. The e xpanded group became r ather close as a r esult; sack lunches were shared under a lar geoak tr ee. There was also a little tension. One time a mechanic cut off Malina’s tie during a visit from Caltech by the latter, because he thought the tie w astoo formal.One of the pr oject’s engineers from A erojet, Walt P owell, had a glider heliked to fly, as it helped him r elieve some of the str ess. He did this sooften that it became a distr action to the group, so Malina took it away and hadit locked up. Powell chased Malina with an ax when he discovered what hadhappened.GALCIT lost many young men to the draft. Project No. 1, however, the officialrocket project at Caltech, had a top priority; thus, its men were exempt. Theproject in the arroyo rated further down the scale. Aerojet had the same problem, at the same time it w as trying to expand to meet the new demand for itsproduct. Hap Arnold himself had to intervene when Andrew Haley was drafted.Haley was back to Aerojet within a w eek, where he replaced von Kármán as thecompany’s president, and w orked hard, demanding that his emplo yees work evenharder. They often took pa y cuts when he felt the company couldn’t afford thepayroll. Haley went on to become president of the International AeronauticalFederation. He traveled widely, and his book is full of pictures of himself withdignitaries like the Pope.Newcomers to Aerojet were often shocked by the uneducated and inexperiencedstaff the compan y had to hir e just to ha ve some bodies around to do the work.A company photo taken when Aerojet was only one year old shows well over 100people. Experienced engineers were not interested in rockets, so they had torely on young inexperienced engineer s fr esh out of college . Von Kármán latersaid this arrangement worked out to their adv antage, as the y didn’t ha ve tountrain an ybody. Amo Smith came back fr om Douglas Air craft to work at Aerojetwith his old classmates, and Fritz Zwicky also joined the company. Zwicky laterdesigned the e xperimental “terr apulse” vehicle, which w as intended fordrilling deep into the earth to ward its center. To my knowledge, it was neverbuilt.Zwicky claimed that when Aerojet first was able to purchase some nitromethane,Parsons stole it and r an some of his o wn tests on it right ther e on A erojetgr ounds. Zwicky also claimed that P arsons used to talk all sorts of occultdoctrine with the Aerojet secretaries in order to get them into bed. Apparently, it worked, although Parsons was considered a handsome enough guy that hedidn’t need much “smooth talk.”Unwilling to pass up an y lead, Parsons was sent to Ne w York in May of 1942 toobserve the work of a man named Ma ynor, who had written Caltech to tell themabout his own rocket project. A two-page handwritten note on file in the JPLarchives written b y Parsons to Malina from the Hotel Go vernor Clinton, NewYork City, on May 5, describes the situation. Ma ynor’s liquid fuel r ocket wasunsatisfactory mechanically, to say the least, and his pr ocedures were unsafe.Parsons told Malina that Maynor endangered himself and the spectators. Maynorclaimed 1000 pounds of thrust had been generated, but Parsons found hismeasuring appar atus and r ecordkeeping pr ocedures questionable. Ma ynor told Parsons that he held six “secr et” patents. Nonetheless, there was nothingfurther w orth investigating here. The second page of P arsons’ note includes afe w hand-drawn sketches of Maynor’s setup. In a two-page letter to Frank Malina in May 1942, John Parsons describes thestunning indequacies of another rocket project he was sent to New York City tocheck out.024 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_024_r1.gif]025 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_025_r1.gif]On A ugust 3 0, 1942, P arsons and Mark M. Mills submitted “Progress R eport onthe De velopment of 2 00-lb.-Thrust Solid-Propellant Jet Units for the Bureau ofAeronautics, Navy Department, Progress Report No. 1-1.” Multiple 2 00-poundunits were to be used together for a single tak e-off. Despite the fact that Parsons was at Aerojet at this time , this r eport is on file in the JPLarchives. On October 16, 1942, Parsons and Mills submitted “The Development ofan Asphalt-Base Solid Pr opellant, Report No. 1-15.” The photo of Parsons in atrench coat was taken around this time, on the occasion of a return to thearroyo from Aerojet for some tests. The photo may have been for the 2 00-poundunits in the A ugust report, or it ma y have been at the new Aerojet site inAzusa. (See photo section.)After Parsons and F orman went to A erojet, GALCIT’s next project was a rocketcar. Malina and Summerfield had r eceived a military contract to test the “Hydrobomb,” which w as a euphemistically-named torpedo. In or der to test the hydrodynamic properties of the Hydrobomb, the gr oup constructed a 5 00-foot long“to wing channel”—basically a long, shallow pit of water. The rocket car wasbuilt on a track above the pit, and the Hy drobomb was mounted on the undersideof the rocket car, with liquid JATOs used to propel it 500 feet at 40 mph, aspeed compar able to what it w ould experience underwater. Pressure gauges weremounted to the Hy drobomb to measure the effects of its motion thr ough the water. Humor ously, the tr ack ended right at the project director’s home.The project had problems, however, caused by acoustic instabilities in thedesign of the JATOs. Acoustics was a y et-to-be-discovered field and thus w asnot r ecognized as the pr oblem. The r ocket car finally self-destructed in ahuge blaze during one of the tests, and the project was abandoned. The dr amaticdemise of the r ocket car w as captured on color film. In 1942, author WilliamA.H. White , who wrote science fiction as Anthon y Boucher and m ysteries asH.H. Holmes (the name of an infamous Chicago mur derer), penned and hadpublished a cr ossover mur der m ystery/science fiction no vel about the rocketcar called Rocket to the Morgue. It was written and published in 1942, and laterreprinted under White’s “Boucher” pseudonym. The novel clearly portrays JohnParsons as one of the main characters. White later founded and edited TheMagazine of Science Fiction and Fantasy, as w ell as writing se veral storiesand no vels in both genres. He w as popular science fiction writer Philip K.Dick’ s editor for years.In Rocket to the Morgue, Parsons is the character Hugo Chantrelle, to whom Whiteoften simply refers as “the goatee.” Ed Forman is his assistant “Gribble ,” andR obert Heinlein is “ Austin Carter.” Science fiction writer and future founderof the Church of Scientology L. Ron Hubbard is “D. V ance Wimple ,” while John W. Campbell is “Don Stewart,” and Jack Williamson is “Joe Hender son.” In the“Afterword” of the 195 1 edition, White sa ys that Heinlein’ s Mañana LiterarySociety “existed in fact precisely as it is depicted in this book . . . I’v emanaged to captur e a moment that has some inter est as a historical footnote topopular cultur e. This is the w ay it w as in Southern California just befor ethe w ar, when science fiction w as being given its present form.” Because ofthis assertion, we must pay close attention to the fact that A ustin Carter(Heinlein) and Hugo Chantrelle (Parsons) spend a lot of time together in thebook, including some meetings at the former’s house. And it should also be notedthat the book was written a few years before Parsons actually met L. RonHubbard.White described Chantrelle as:[A]n eccentric scientist. In working hours at the California Institute ofTechnology he was an uninspired routine laboratory man; but on his own time hedevoted himself to those peripheral aspects of science which the scientificpurist damns as mumbo-jumbo, those new alchemies and astrologies out of whichthe race may in time construct unsurmised wonders of chemistry and astronomy.The rocketry of Pendray, the time-dreams of Dunne, the extra sensory perceptionof Rhine, the sea serpents of Gould, all these held his interests far more thanany research conducted by the Institute. He was inevitably a member of the Fortean Society of America, and had his own file of unbelievable incidentseventually to be published as a supplement to the works of Charles For t. Itmust be added in his favor that his scientific training automatically preservedhim from the errors of the Master [For t]. His file was car efullyauthenticated, and often embellished with first-hand reports.The entire book is worth reading for nothing else than the characterization of Parsons as Chantr elle. While it is obviously a liter ary portrayal rather than abiographical sketch, Rocket to the Morgue certainly depicts the author’ simpression of Parsons. White’s statement about Parsons being a member of the Fortean Society, for instance, may not be factual, but certainly P arsons w asinter ested in “Forteana,” the bizarre scientific anomalies found ar ound theglobe for millennia and chronicled by the indefatigable Fort.White’s reference to “the time-dreams of Dunne” was repeated elsewhere in thebook and concerns J.W . Dunne’ s An Experiment With Time, an odd little v olumefirst published in 1927. Dunne’ s hypothesis, which he supports with lengthydescriptions of his own dreams, is that dreams may often foretell future events.He goes to gr eat lengths to support this with a philosophical discussion of thenatur e of time. Austin Carter (Heinlein) w as also quite inter ested in Dunne’s book, according to White’s dramatization, in which Chantrelle spends much ofthe time describing his pr emonitions of the mur der and other ominous events,brought on by his “Extr a Sensory Perception,” which he repeats often, or hisequally mystical “awareness of past phases of seriotemporal existence.”Chantrelle mentions Starmaker author Olaf Stapleton as w ell as Fowler F oulkesas tw o science fiction writer s who had impr essed him, possibly favorites ofParsons’ as well.18 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-18] Chantrelle alsosays that “one of the greatest services science fiction can render to science”is to lead the public gr adually into accepting implausible concepts asfantastic, evidently referring to Parsons’ public acceptance of his own rockets,if this was indeed a comment of his.White’s account of the rocket car is a bit garbled, but the incidental materialhe documents surr ounding the science fiction writer s in Southern California atthe time is inv aluable to any historian. Based on his description, it is clearhe never visited GALCIT to witness a test of the rocket car, nor did he seem tounder stand exactly how it was configured. He does make it an interesting plotdevice, however: it is the mur der w eapon. P erhaps he hear d of the r ocketcar pr oject directly from Parsons, though Parsons’ involvement (if any) withthe project was incidental, possibly exaggerated by him, or he may have beenther e in some less-than-official capacity . A ccording to Alv a Rogers,White/Boucher visited Parsons’ house frequently enough to get much of hismaterial from Parsons himself.It is appr opriate that P arsons w as fascinated b y and inv olved in not onlyrocket science but also science fiction, since the latter is an inspiration forthe former, providing ideas about where humanity and the future are headed thatcan be acted upon and brought to fruition. Science fiction and fantas y alsobridge the tw o seemingly dispar ate worlds that P arsons occupied, i.e ., theaer ospace industry and the occult. The combination is not so strange, however,as numerous scientists, engineers, researchers and other professionals also havehad spiritual and religious lives. What is surprising to the average person,however, is that P arsons was apparently so unorthodo x and r ebellious, butthis “delightful scr ewball,” as von Kármán called Parsons, was never contentwith the conventional, ordinary and mundane. In both sides of his double life,he would always shoot for the moon."},{"pageContent":"fiveThe Return to South Orange Grove Ave.: 1942-1945On June 26, 1942, John and Helen Parsons moved from 168 S. Terrace Drive intothe old Arthur Fleming mansion at 1 003 S. Or ange Gr ove A ve., just blocks from where he had gr own up at 537 S. Or ange Gr ove A ve. Fleming Mansion was anexpensive and exclusive part of Pasadena, called, as noted, “Millionair e’s Mile,” with palm tr ees lining the str eets and flowering magnolias adorning the yards. Ther e was also a smaller coach house on the grounds, at 10031/2 S. OrangeGrove Ave., where Wilfred Smith lived. Life in P asadena in the early ’40s isaccur ately portrayed in James Cain’s novel Mildred Pierce, which was made intothe film starring Joan Cr awford.According to writer Iris Chang, Parsons had a mannequin dressed in a tuxedo onhis front porch, upon which he placed a sign sa ying, “The Resident.” Next tothe mannequin w as a bucket for the mail-man to place all mail so addressed.Built by its namesake out of r edwood around the turn of the century, the housewas modeled after the Norwegian homes of the time.19[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-19] There were 10 bedrooms on threefloors in the main house, with several mor e bedr ooms in the coach house behindit. A small domed portico supported b y six concr ete columns stood in the backyard. Parsons converted the estate buildings into appr oximately 19 apartments.The house w as razed in the late 1940s to mak e room for an apartment complex.Fleming, the original owner of the mansion, was a noted philanthropist and NobelPrize winner who had made a good deal of money in the Canadian logging industry. He had donated o ver $5 million to Caltech alone and w as the Chairman of itsBoar d of Directors. He also owned what would become Yosemite after he sold theacreage to the government at half-price for the purpose of establishing a park,r ather than selling out to commer cial interests who were vying for the land.Fleming had arriv ed in P asadena decades earlier , soon after which his wifedied. Fleming himself died on A ugust 11, 1940, and the big old house stood vacant until an attorne y named John M. Dean and his wife Dorothy bought theplace in 1942. Parsons leased the house fr om Dean, and the A gape Lodge relocated to “the Parsonage,” as it came to be called. Dean does not sho w up onthe membership rosters from that period, but he must ha ve been privy andsympathetic to the lodge’s activities, as he and his wife resided in the housealong with P arsons and the other s, according to the 1947 city directory.Parsons’ bedroom upstairs, which was the largest room, doubled as a temple.There was the obligatory copy (handcrafted) of the Stele of Revealing, anEgyptian tablet that had inspired Crowley during his trip in 1904 to Cairo,where it was object number 666 in the Museum of Antiquities.20[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-20] Crowley’s translation of the steleappears in Liber AL, a section of which, AL III:10, requires a copy for ritualpurposes. The Parsonage also contained a beautiful libr ary with w ood paneling,a large signed portrait of Crowley, hundreds of books on occult matters, and thenumerous letters exchanged between Crowley and Parsons. The living r oomcontained an e xpensive, modern hi-fi system—Parsons loved to play classicalmusic at very high volume.Parsons lived next to the estate of the late Lilly Anheuser Busch, widow ofbrewer Adolphus Busch, and the house backed up onto the famous Busch Sunk enGardens, which w ere beautiful and huge , at least 34 acres in size, by earlyaccounts. By Parsons’ time there were 11 acres left, which is still quitesizable for a well-maintained park in a residential area. One photo of Lillyshows her painting a landscape scene in the gar dens, surr ounded b y concr etey ard gnomes . Her estate was also the site of public Easter egg hunts for thecity’ s children. The city briefly considered making the gardens into a parkafter her death, but the land was sold and subdivided in the late 195 0s.Parsons shocked his conservative neighbors when he started renting out r ooms toless-than-desir able tenants. The fr equent visitors, noisy parties, andquestionable goings-on raised many eyebrows. One visitor wrote that “tw o womenin diaphanous go wns would dance around a pot of fir e, surrounded by coffinstopped with candles . . . all I could think at the time was that if those robescaught on fire the whole house w ould go up lik e a tinderbo x.” He also saidthat an opera singer and several astrologers lived in the house. It is amusingto ponder the contrast to the previous owner’s habits and what Lilly Busch andher friends thought about all this.

During these meetings Rogers soon fell in love with a young artist whoroomed there, and visited whenever he could, prior to mo ving in. In a 1962fanzine article entitled “Darkhouse,” Rogers wrote:In the ads placed in the local paper Jack specified that only bohemians, artists, musicians, atheists, anar chists, or other exotic types need apply for rooms—any mundane soul would be unceremoniously rejected. This ad, needless tosay, caused quite a flap in Pasadena when it appear ed . . .There was a fine selection of hand-picked tenants, characters all. A fewexamples: The pr ofessional fortune teller and seer who always wore appropriatedr esses and decorated her apar tment with symbols and artifacts of arcane lore;a lady, well past middle-age but still strikingly beautiful, who claimed to havebeen at various times the mistress of half the famous men in France; a man whohad been a r enowned organist for most of the gr eat movie palaces of the silentera. 21 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-21]Jack’s library (a lar ge wood paneled r oom graced with a comfortable leathercouch and a couple of leather chairs) was lined with books devoted almostexclusively to the occult, and to the published works of Aleister Cr owley.Dominating the r oom was a large photo-portrait of Crowley affectionatelyinscribed to Jack. He also had a voluminous correspondence with Crowley in thelibrary, some of which he showed me. I r emember in particular one letter fromCrowley which praised and encouraged him for the fine work he was doing inAmerica, and also casually thanked him for his latest donation and intimatedthat mor e would be shor tly needed. Jack admitted that he was one of Cowley’smain sources of money in America.The financial arr angements R ogers mentioned w ere as follo ws: Parsons wouldforward the money to Karl Germer in New York, who would send it on to Cr owleyin England. Germer (January 22, 1885-October 25, 1962) was known in the OTO as“Frater Saturnus.” These financial arrangements lasted until Crowley’s death in1947.Again, to quote Rogers:Jack was the antithesis of the common image of the Black Magician; in fact hebore little resemblance to his revered Master, Aleister Crowley, either in looksor in his personal conduct. He was a good looking man in his early or midthirties, urbane and sophisticated, and possessed a fine sense of humor . . . Ialways found Jack’s insistence that he believed in and practiced magic har d toreconcile with his educational and cultural backgr ound. At first I thought itwas all fun and games, a kick he was on for its shock value to his r espectablefriends; but after seeing his cor respondence with Crowley, and the evidence ofthe fr equent remittances to Crowley, I had to give him the benefit of thedoubt.The association becomes easier to r econcile when one consider s Crowley’s o wnvie w of magic , pr esented in Liber O vel Manus et Sagittae: “In this book itis spoken of the Sephiroth, and the Paths, of Spirits and Conjur ations; ofGods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may not exist.“It is immaterial whether the y exist or not. By doing certain things certain results follo w; students ar e most earnestly w arned against attributingobjective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.”Despite Parsons’ outward appearance, he was the subject of regular publicattention and rumor s that he w as the leader of a “black magic cult,” rumor sdenied b y his scientific associates , man y of whom were regulars at the house,if not members of one or the other orders. As early as 194 1, Parsons wasinvestigated (at his pr evious residence), but no arrests were made. Rather thanany occult activities, this investigation concerned some e xplosives he wasstoring at the house, either the tetr anitromethane Malina mentioned, or thegunpowder Forman’s first wife talked about, or both.In 1942, local police came to 1 003 S. Orange Grove to investigate an allegedbacky ard cer emony wher ein a pr egnant w oman had reportedly jumped nude through a fir e nine times. The police made it clear that the y thought the claimabsur d and that the y were only investigating because it w as their duty.Parsons easily assured them of his community standing: he was an importantrocket scientist with a professional reputation to uphold. Ironically, theceremony probably took place as described.A 16-y ear-old bo y r eported P arsons to the police , claiming that three of Parsons’ follo wers had for cibly sodomized him during a “Black Mass” at thehouse . Again the police inv estigated but found Parsons’ “cult” to be littlemor e than “ an organization dedicated to religious and philosophicalspeculation, with r espectable member s such as a Pasadena bank president,doctors, lawyers, and Hollywood actors.” The actor John Carradine, for example,read one of Crowley’s poems at the inauguration of Agape Lodge No. 2 in 1935.In September 1942, the P asadena police r eceived an anon ymous tip via a lettersent by an ex-member of the Agape Lodge bearing the signature “A Real Soldier”and postmark ed San Antonio, T exas that accused P arsons of “black magic and sex or gies.” Once again, Parsons was cleared of all char ges. An anon ymousletter w as also sent in October 1944.Local papers are said to have revived these stories during slow news periods,but I w as unable to find an y of the articles . The police always stood b ytheir original findings whene ver further accusations arose. Too many cries of“W olf!” made them turn a blind e ye. Although r ape w as not going on, plentyof other unusual (but legal) things w ere, and the neighbor s just had to learnto live with it.The Pasadena branch of the OTO had its other tr oubles, some of which werecaused by Parsons’ and Crowley’s financial go-between, Karl Germer. Germer hadarrived in the United States from a German concentration camp and settled in New York. His stated goal w as to work on building up the OTO in his new country;in actuality he did the opposite. Germer took a par anoid dislike to Wilfr edSmith, perhaps because he sa w him as a competitor for the lead position, andbegan a smear campaign, constantly writing Cr owley about Smith’ s activities inthe worst possible light.Wilfred Smith had a r eputation as a w omanizer which equaled that of Crowley,who viewed his own succession of “Scarlet Women” as a necessary magical aid.Smith’s affairs, however, seemed to be an opportunity for Germer to deride him.Ov er 2 00 letter s exchanged between Crowley and Smith during this period havebeen preserved, letters that evidently document the slo w but steady deterioration of the relationship between Crowley and Smith.Like P arsons, Lodge Master Wilfr ed Smith w as a good-looking man with acharming per sonality and a str ong love of women. One of Smith’s lovers wasHelen Parsons, John’s wife, who bore Smith a son in 1943. Germer convinced Crowley that this affair w as the last straw with Smith, who was now a detrimentto the work of the OTO, particularly with a child to r ear.Ironically, considering the “Gr eat Beast’ s” o wn salacious r eputation,Crowley wrote Smith that he was giving the OTO “the reputation of being thatslim y abomination ‘a lo ve cult.’ Alr eady in 19 15 in Vancouver, all I knew ofyou was that you were running a mother and her daughter in double harness—sincethen one scandal has followed another.”Crowley himself w as no str anger to scandal. In fact, he himself had had anumber of children by different women. This “black magician,” as he came to beconsidered in his native England, eventually committed many blasphemies againstChristianity , which, after his wretched childhood, he set out to destr oy and replace with “Crowleyanity” and his “La w of Thelema,” which he truly hoped wouldsweep the world.Married to Rose Kelley, whose brother Gerald would become the Knighted President of London’ s R oyal A cademy, Cr owley liv ed a leisurely life becauseof a large sum of money his father left him. He was an imposing figur e and thebeneficiary of numer ous unusual adventures. One night of his and R ose’shoneymoon, for e xample, was spent in the so-called King’s Chamber of the GreatPyramid, during which Crowley worked ceremonial magic.Crowley was not content to be monogamous, however, and he had a v oracious sexual appetite for both w omen and men. In fact, the “Key” to the OTO was sexmagick. Cr owley’s sex rites, however, were not to be tak en lightly orcasually, as he himself thought them to be very serious and powerful magic.Crowley’s ritual sex partners were often prostitutes and men he’d picked up inTurkish bath houses. Even with the women the Great Beast often insisted on having anal intercourse, so convinced w as he of its magical qualities. One of hissexual partners and first disciples w as Victor Neubur g, an orthodo x Je w whohad become agnostic and with whom Cr owley pla yed the passiv e r ecipient.Neuburg, who was in lo ve with the Gr eat Beast, was also the victim of Crowley’s sadism, enduring beatings , including one acr oss the butt with nettles.In his pr actices he also used his “Scarlet W omen,” including a young girlnamed Leah Hir sig, to whom Cr owley had tak en a fanc y in the spring of 1918.Leah did not serve as the Scarlet Woman, however, until 192 0, at Cr owley’sAbbe y of Thelema at Cefalu, Sicily , which he and Leah called the “College ofthe Holy Ghost” and which was “sexually free.” At one point at the Abbey, a malegoat was supposed to copulate with Leah, but he “failed to perform” and wassacrificed, splattering Leah with his blood.One scandal that nearly torpedoed Cr owley w as the death of a young acolyte whohad engaged in a ritual of drug-taking and drinking the blood of a sacrificedcat. The incident w as the source of sensational headlines in London: “Ne wSinister R evelations of Aleister Crowley. Varsity Lad’s Death. Enticed to ‘Abbey’. Dreadful Ordeal of A Young Wife. Cr owley’s Plans ,” as w ell as “YoungWife’ s Story of Crowley’s Abbey. Scenes of Horror. Drugs Magic and Vile Practices.” Crowley was accused not only of sexual deviation but also ofcannibalism. Because of such bad publicity, Crowley ironically riled Italy’sfascist dictator, Mussolini, no angel himself, and w as subsequently tossed outof that country and his abbey.The German br anches of the OTO were closed because of the Nazis, who alsoarrested and tortured Crowley’s main advocate and money-supplier, Karl Germer,one of whose friends, Martha Küntzel, became an ar dent admir er of Hitler and“r egularly bombar ded Crowley with letters loaded with praises of Hitler.”Adding to his scandals, at one point Crowley tried to make money selling “Elixirof Life Pills” that w ere supposed to enhance virility . Those who took them probably never realized they were composed of a “neutral base combined withCrowley’s own semen.” They were probably energized by some sort of se x magick.Thus, it is clear that Crowley’s excoriation of Smith was based not on anyso-called morals but w as merely an excuse for him to blast Smith. In reality,when Cr owley heard that Smith had legally incorporated the Chur ch of Thelema,he mistak enly took it to mean that Smith intended to r aise his ne w son to replace Cr owley. Germer played no little part in this deception.Crowley removed Smith thr ough an ingenious means . First, he drew up ahoroscope for Smith based on the unusual cir cumstance of his birth. Smith’ shor oscope had a comple x of eight planets , which one could easily interpret asif Smith were an avatar of some god. This comple x was something Cr owley hadfound in only one other instance, that of Shak espeare. He called it “one of themost astonishingly fortunate figures that Frater 666 [Crowley] has ever set upin his whole life!” and printed the hor oscope, intended only for Smith, underthe title, “Is Smith A God?” The 12-page document was also titled LiberApotheosis or Liber 132.Crowley wrote: The simple, the astounding tr uth, flooded the mind of Frater 666with light. It explains all obscurities; it reconciles all contradictions. Wehave all of us thr oughout been kindled by a single misappr e-hension, preciselyas if a Staff of Astronomers mistaking a planet for a star, observed its motion,and so found nothing but irritating, bewildering, inexplicable attacks upon the“Laws of Natur e.”All becomes clear on r ecognizing the fundamental mistake: Wilfred T . Smith,Frater 132, is not a man at all; he is the Incarnation of some God! He hoped Smith’ s ego w as big enough to fall for it y et he also secretlywondered if it w eren’t somehow true, as his belief in astr ology required it tobe true no matter ho w paradoxical he per sonally found it to be. The members ofthe lodge started referring to Smith as “the Unknown God,” a reference to theNew Testament verse of Acts 17:23, which reads: 0For as I [Paul] passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I foundalso an altar with this inscription, ‘T o an unknown god.’ What ther efore youworship as unknown, this I pr oclaim to you.It has not been documented whether Smith e ver claimed “Knowledge & Conversationof the Holy Guardian Angel,” which was a part of the A∴A∴’s 5°=6 rite.“Is Smith A God?” continues:The word “god” implies a fact; it is no question of convenience as when theEphesians called Barnabas “Jupiter” and Paul “Mercury.” [Acts 14]The incarnation of a god is an exceedingly rare event to become known, althoughfr equent enough when he makes it secr etly “to take his pleasure on the earthamong the legions of the living.” It being known, it is important to ascertainhis purpose, especially as (in the present case) the material envelope has beenso per fectly constructed that he is himself not fully aware of it.One must distinguish such cases very sharply indeed from that phenomenon—inthese days so common as to constitute an appeciable percentage of the populationas to exercise noticeable influ-ence upon society—of the incarnation ofelementals.Nor is a god her e to be confounded with a daimon or angel, even although hisfunction wholly or in par t prove to be that of an angel or messenger (cf. TheBook of the Law I , 7: there is no reason to suppose that Aiwaz is, or is not, aliving man).By “god” is to be understood a complete macr ocosmic individual as contrastedwith human-elementals who incar nate par tialplanetary or zodiacal-intelligencesof higher or lower rank in the Yetziratic Hierarchies; such are salamanders,undines, sylphs and gnomes in human form.It is of the first impor tance for those who would reap full benefit from thesojourn of such a King on this planet that they should understand his nature;they ought to know his name! To determine his identity is a task of notablemagnitude . . .It must therefore be his primary task to recognize himself. With this end inview he must first of all withdraw completely fr om further occasion ofcontamination; and he must devise for himself . . . a true method ofself-realization.It is not necessar y that the god should have incar nated at (or before) the birth of Wilfr ed T. Smith. A quite possibly significant moment might have been theSummer Solstice of 1916, or during the Winter of 1906 when ter rific forces wereset in motion by the Chiefs of the Order.The “child” (i.e. the “god”) might well have been begotten by the Paris W orking(Januar y, 1914) or as the r esult of some of the immense Enochian invocations:in the latter case the name of the god required might be found on the W atchTowers of the Universe [the Enochian Tablets], his natur e deter mined byanalysis of the squares concerned. Another possibility suggested by the place ofresidence of Frater 132 is that one of the aboriginal “Red Indian” gods may haveseized the opportunity somehow afforded by Frater 132’s state at the moment . ..Frater 132 has to realize and proclaim his identity and function very much asFrater 666 regards himself in the light of what is spoken of him in The Book ofthe Law. He ought to be able to say simply: I am Apu-t or Kebeshnut orThoum-aesh-neith, or as may be the case. It will not serve the present purposeto accept Asar [Osiris], or Ra, or one of the universal gods such as of whom allmen are in a sense incarnations.Crowley then sent Smith on a “Gr and Magical R etirement” to find the god withinhimself. Unkno wn to her, Helen was going to accompany him, but it is unclearwhere their son went during this time. The High Priestess of the Agape Lodge,Regina Kahl, was quite ill and spent much of this period in the hospital. Herlast attendance of a lodge meeting occurr ed in No vember 1942. After his “retirement,” Smith often tried to go back to the house according to GradyMcMurtry (later Hymenaeus Alpha X°), but he was not welcome there.At this time, Parsons was corresponding with McMurtry, who was stationed in Europe on military duty . McMurtry often sent P arsons poems he had written,usually of a m ystical nature. Parsons encouraged McMurtry to contact Cr owleywhile he w as in England, an act that led to Cr owley initiating McMurtry allthe w ay to the X° of the OTO. To Parsons’ surprise, McMurtry returned to theUnited States a few short years later as his superior in the Order. With Smithhaving left, Parsons was Acting Head of the Lodge at this time.Smith’s retirement took place at a turkey farm outside of Pasadena belonging toa member of the lodge named R oy Leffingw ell. In his quest to find the godwithin himself, Smith had to build a small altar from rocks he found the site.He also had to tattoo the “Mark of the Beast” on his for ehead or right palm and(if desir ed) over his heart and his mons veneris (sic). Everything thathappened to him during the retreat was to be carefully recorded and forwarded toGermer, the “Outer Head” of the OTO. Eventually, Smith was told by Leffingwellto leave the farm.While Smith thus floundered, Parsons had plenty of money for his occultactivities , as , b y the summer of 1943, A erojet w as doing $650,000 inbusiness. In June of that y ear, Parsons and v on Kármán were invited toNorfolk, Virginia, where they turned their attention to aircraft carriersbecause JATOs were unable to keep up with the bigger bombers and the ease withwhich run ways were now being constructed. Two of v on Kármán’s former studentsw ere now a captain and an admir al in the Na vy, and the Hungarian and P arsonsw ere invited to demonstrate their JATOs for the Secretary of the Navy and hisadmirals. This test took place on the USS Charger, which w as docked at Norfolk.Parsons outfitted a Grumman airplane with solid-fuel JATOs, but when the planetook off it co vered the Secretary and his admirals with a cloud of yellow smokethat left a nasty residue. A few of the officers got mad, but the Secretarymerely told them to find a way to get rid of the smok e and they would have acontract. This incident led to the development of Aeroplex, Aerojet’s brand namefor smokeless powder.Also in 1943 P arsons divorced Helen, ha ving struck up a r elationship with hery ounger sister (the y may have been half-sister s), Sara Elizabeth Northrup,AKA “Betty.” Another version of events says that Parsons took up with Bettybefore this, when Helen was out of town. Parsons told his old friend R ypinski,“I got rid of m y wife [Helen] b y witchcr aft.” Born April 8, 1925, Betty w astall (5 ′ 9 ” ), slender, with blondish brown hair. Like Helen before her, Bettyacted as Parsons’ priestess at the Gnostic Mass, the pair fulfilling the rolesleft vacant by Smith and K ahl. Parsons’ devotion was such that the Mass washeld every single day. Betty was also Parsons’ partner in the performance of sex magick—the “magic” of inducing alter ed states through prolonged sexualecstasy. K ahl, on the other hand, was a lesbian.At Parsons’ ur ging the 18-y ear-old Betty left the Univ ersity of SouthernCalifornia ( USC). Parsons was 11 years her senior, and her parents were not atall happ y about the arr angement. Parsons later noted the implied element ofadultery and incest in this r elationship with his wife’s sister was mostappealing. (The breaking of taboos is a typical “tantric” practice, but it mayalso be that Parsons felt stung by his wife’ s “betr ayal” with Smith.) P arsonsand Betty liv ed as a couple, although they never did marry.Interestingly, Parsons encouraged Betty to take other lovers, as he did, becausehe per ceived himself abo ve the petty jealousies felt b y normal men. F or atime , this sentiment w as true, and their v arious affairs seem to ha vestrengthened their feelings for each other , paradoxical as that may sound. Atthe end of the day, they always had one another to turn to.Of their relationship, Alva Rogers wrote:Betty, who had been living with Jack for a number of years, complemented himadmirably. She was young, blonde, ver y attractive, full of joie de vivr e,thoughtful, humorous, generous, and all that. She assisted Jack in the OTO andseemed to possess the same devotion to it and to Crowley as did Jack . . . Therappor t between Jack and Betty, the strong affection, if not love, they had foreach other, despite their fr equent separate sextracur ricular activities,seemed pretty permanent and shatterproof.As P arsons w as fond of Cr owley, so w as the magus in turn impressed byParsons, although he w orried about the y oung man’ s loyalty to Smith, in whomCrowley could only see trouble. Soon after Smith departed, Parsons sent an offerof retirement to Crowley, as he thought Crowley was treating Smith unfairly andtherefore didn’t feel right about taking his place. Crowley did not accept theoffer and, in July 1943, wr ote a letter to lodge member Max Schneider: “ As toJack: I think he is perfectly alright at the bottom of e verything; but he isvery young, and he has at pr esent nothing like the strength to deal withmatters within his jurisdiction objectively.” (Schneider and his wife had asmall cabin on Mount P alomar that the member s of the lodge often used forshort retreats.)Although quite reckless in his personal life, Crowley was a decent judge of character, and his opinion of Jack w as good, if some what guarded, consistentlydocumented in his letters to other members. In December of 1943, Crowley wroteto the actress Jane Wolfe, who had earlier alerted him to Parsons’ potential as“the child”:Jack is the Objective (Smith is out, an afaire classée: anybody who communicateswith him in any way is out also; and that is that, and the best plan is tosponge the whole slate clean, and get to work to build up Thelema on soundprinciples. And no mor e of this brothel-building: let’s use marble, not r ottenold boar ds!) Jack’s trouble is his weakness, and his r omantic side—the poet—isat present a hindrance. He gets a kick from some magazine trash, or an ‘occult’novel (if only he knew how they wer e concocted!) and dashes off in wildpursuit. He must learn that the sparkle of champagne is based on sound wine;pumping carbonic acid into urine is not the same thing.I wish to God I had him for six months—even three, with a hustle—to train inWill, in discipline. He must understand that fine and fiery flashes of Spiritcome fr om the organization of Matter, from the drilling of ever y function ofever y bodily or gan until it has become so r egular as to be automatic, and carried on by itself deep down in the Unconscious. It is the steadiness of one’sHeart that enables one to endur e the raptur e of gr eat passion; one doesn’twant the vital functions to be excitable.In F ebruary 1944, he wr ote to the Burlingames (also lodge members):. . . I am ver y glad indeed of your of fer to co-operate practically in any waypossible. I have left Jack Parsons in charge; he is quite all right in essence,but ver y young and easily swayed by passing influences. I shall look to you tohelp in keeping him up to the mark.In contrast, three Aerojet memos written by Parsons in August of 1944 clearlysho w him in char ge of his pr ogram there, working on smokeless powder withaluminum perchlorate as an oxidizer. Despite others’ failures with thesematerials , Parsons practically insisted on moving ahead with his o wnexperiments. He also attended a solid fuel conference during the summer and fallof 1944, of which his typed notes are now in the JPL archives.Obviously, Parsons liked to be in charge and not under authority, in both his professional and per sonal liv es. Sometime that y ear Parsons made an interesting statement in a letter sent to McMurtry: “I am a little sour on the OTOinasmuch as by experience I doubt the value of member ship coming in e xcept viapr evious experience and individual training of the A∴A∴ sort. It seems to methe early grades (which are all we have here) are too free in admittingnon-descripts and too lax in that they do not provide a definite program oftraining and qualifications. The better people I have met always seem to comevia an interest in A∴A∴ aspects.” This instance is not the fir st time Parsonsquestioned his association with the OTO, nor would it be his last. He had a longhistory of bucking authority; theO TO soon became one more “authority” trying totell him what to do.While he concerned with formal tr aining and qualifications in his “spiritual”life, Parsons had no need for it in his aer ospace occupation. Indeed, hethrived without such academic accomplishment and credentials, as did thebusiness and science he helped found. In 1944, GALCIT changed its name to theJet Pr opulsion Laboratory ( JPL), a term coined in a memorandum written by vonKármán, Malina, and Tsien on No vember 2 0, 1943. A t that time their budget was an astounding $65 0,000, and appr oximately 80 people w orked ther e, thoughSummerfield w as still oper ating out of his car . Malina w as soon namedDirector of JPL, a position he held until 1946, although he is usually r eferredto as the second Dir ector, v on Kármán b y default being the fir st. It seemsthat Malina w as retreating from his anti-capitalist stance, also expressing tohis parents just a little over a year earlier that “we are getting to be moreand more like capitalists.” However, Malina and his fir st wife w erelong-standing member s of the local communist “cell,” which certainly had muchto do with his getting out of the rocket business after the end of the w ar.Despite the impr essive budget, the JPL facilities were still r ather primitive.Eugene Pierce, a local architect, took a job as an administrative assistant around this time . Of his fir st trip to the arroyo he said, “I took one look atthose half-a-dozen nondescript, corrugatedmetal and r edwood-tie and stonebuildings and thought, m y God!—what have I gotten m yself into? Ther e’s nofutur e for an ar chitect here.” Inside, the buildings things were no better.The corridors were extremely narrow, and Pier ce shared an 8-b y-10 office withMalina and secretary Dorothy Lewis, with whom JPL historians were able toconduct an oral history interview in 1972. In the interview, Lewis told themthat P arsons “w as the clo wn of the gr oup. He lo ved to pla y jokes. That wasall right.” Dorothy’s office overlooked the liquid fuel test pit. Conversationhalted whenever a test was run.Malina and Summerfield launched a small series of r ockets called the “Priv ate”in 1944, when Malina paused long enough to r ealize that they now had the meansto carry out the original goal of the early GALCIT group. Constructed of littlemor e than JATOs to which fins and a nose cone were attached, the Privatessuccessfully carried meteorological equipment high into the atmospher e—for thepurposes of pur e research rather than military applications . This completedgoal made Malina happ y. The Priv ate A w as launched fr om Leach Spring, atCamp Irwin near Bar stow, California, an army base in the Mojave Desert.The following year, however, found Malina working with missiles meant to be fired into enem y territory . The pr oject ORDCIT—“America’s first long rangemissile and space exploration program”—was formed for this purpose , in the samearroyo where GALCIT was located. Two of the missiles de veloped, the solid-fuelSer geant and the liquid-fuel Corporal, were never deployed, but the later Regulus missile was. The Regulus was developed by others for deployment inwestern Europe during the Cold W ar. These small, mobile missiles were launchedfrom the backs of trucks and, as with the other early missiles, were simply madefr om large solid-fuel JATOs with a fe w minor modifications to make them fly.It is another odd “ coincidence” that the term “R egulus,” a star in theconstellation Leo, appear s in the w ork of Aleister Cr owley, appearing in thetitle of Crowley’s Liber V vel Reguli in its plural form. Reproduced in Regardie’s Gems from the Equinox, Liber V is “the Ritual of the Mark of theBeast: an incantation pr oper to invoke the Energies of the A eon of Horus ,adapted for the daily use of the Magician of whatever grade.” The “Mark of theBeast,” of cour se, is what Smith was supposed to tattoo on himself during his retreat.On March 11, 1945, Parsons wrote to McMurtry that he w as “trying to get outfrom under [the OTO] and more into A∴A∴ work which suits me far better and inwhich I think I can do mor e.” However, he was not quite r eady to lea ve theOTO at this time , and its appar ent influence on his life would continue.Despite his occult leanings , Parsons enjoyed respectability in his professionalwork. On Mar ch 15 the Saturday Evening P ost ran an article called “ JATOs Get’Em Up,” highlighting the v ery successful use of solid-fuel JATOs, with mentionof Parsons, Forman, Malina and Summerfield as the de velopers, under the direction of v on Kármán. The article discusses the differ ent w artimeapplications for which JATOs were currently being used, including on the Na vy’sPB-2Y seaplanes and the small Corsairs that were launched from aircraftcarriers. Because of the JATOs, which helped them launch without the advantageof a long, smooth str etch of w ater, Catalan Flying Boats were able to land inthe chopp y waters of the South P acific, undeterred by 18-foot swells, to carryout a r escue mission. Another dramatic rescue was made in Southern Californiawhen a Martin Mariner was forced down in a small lak e: the Mariner needed afull mile to take off, but the lake was only 3000 feet at its greatest width, soJATOs were mounted under the plane’ s wings, allowing it to get back into theair safely.Another one of the JPL group, Charles Bartley 22[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-22], made an improvement to P arsons’original asphalt binder in 1945. T o r eplace the asphalt, Bartley created apolysulfide compound, for which the word “thiokol” w as coined, fr om the Gr eekw ords for “sulphur” and “glue.” Called “Thiok ol LP-2,” the compound is apolymer , which means an artificial compound with a very repetitive molecularstructure consisting of long molecules joined together endlessly . The r egularmolecular structur e is what giv es polymer s their desir able qualities.The compound name can also be found in “Morton-Thiok ol,” a well-recognizedaerospace manufacturing firm today. As late as the Korean War, solid-fuel JATOswere used on Sabre Jet fighters, which would jettison the canisters after use,such that the Korean jungles must be full of them. Solid-fuel r ockets launchedthe P olaris missiles, a name corr elating to “P ole Star,” the monik er Parsonsused in writing to r efer to Smith. Solid fuel, of cour se, is also whatlaunches the Space Shuttle, of which Morton-Thiokol was the manufacturer untilthe Challenger disaster , after which A erojet got the contract.In 1945, Betty’s sentiment was recorded by Jane Wolfe who shared some otherconcerns about P arsons’ private life in a letter to K arl Germer:There is something strange going on, quite apar t from [Wilfr ed] Smith. Ther eis always Betty [N or thrup], r emember, who hates Smith. But our own Jack isenamored with Witchcraft, the hounfort, voodoo. From the start he always wantedto evoke something—no matter what, I am inclined to think, as long as he got a result.According to Meeka [Aldrich] yester day, he has had a r esult—an elemental hedoesn’t know what to do with. Fr om that statement of hers, it must botherhim—somewhat at least.Parsons’ ardent thrill-seeking was, of course, not just professional butpersonal, and he once wrote that one of the rituals he used w as “liable to produce dangerous side phenomena and sometimes permanent haunting in an ar eawhere it is r epeated.” Wolfe’s “witchcraft” r eference is to one of P arsons’pr ojects, called “The Witchcraft,” which, along with “The Gnosis ,” w as hisattempt to devise a religious system of his o wn that addr essed fields Cr owleyseems to ha ve stayed out of. The surviving paper s concerning The Gnosis andthe Witchcr aft are reproduced in the book Freedom Is A Two-Edged Sword.The elementals or spirits Parsons was invoking evidently disturbed the otherParsonage residents. One still-living and activ e member of the OTO and the A∴A∴today, Phyllis Seckler (“Soror Meral,” initiated by Wolfe into the A∴A∴),recorded:Meeka also reported to Jane that another two persons always had to do a lot ofbanishing in the house. They were sensitive and knew that there was somethingalien and inimical was there [sic]. When I had been ther e during the summer of1944, I also knew ther e were troublesome spirits about, especially on the thirdfloor. It got I couldn’t stand being up there, and a friend of mine couldn’teven climb the stairs that far, as the hair on the back of her neck began toprickle and she got thoroughly frightened.The “Meek a” referred to w as Meek a Aldrich, who pledged the grade of Minervalin August 1945 and was granted the I° of the OTO on August 25. Like HelenParsons had for a while, she served as the treasurer of Agape Lodge inSeptember, though she shared that office with another during the follo wingmonth. Meek a kept active in the lodge after that, and w as the one who foundplaces for the lodge to meet from late 1946 into 1948.As the w ar ended, the founder s of A erojet started looking for a way to mak ethe firm viable , because its futur e was suddenly v ery uncertain. It is ironic that P arsons’ w ork, despite its anti-military beginnings and goal, hadbecome the backbone of military oper ations, so much so that his company wasvirtually dependent on war. How he w as able to r econcile his pr ofession withhis per sonal life, which, while hedonistic, he ostensibly viewed as spiritual,is a quirk of the human mind in gener al, as millions of other s have been ableto do the same.Fortunately, the firm w as able to convince Gener al Tire to invest in it. If itsucceeded, fine; if not, Gener al Tire was big enough to absorb the loss as atax write-off. With the purchase, Aerojet became Aerojet General, today known asGenCorp Aerojet. Once General Tire bought in, it decided it w anted the wholepie but none of the old-timers hanging ar ound, so it sent its people out to strong-arm Aerojet’s founder s into r elinquishing their stock. All sold out butMalina, who happened to be in London at the time and who later wrote thatsunspot activity disrupted the telegr aph tr ansmission, such that he never gotthe offer. The solar storm proved a boon, however, as he became a millionaire asa result. In the ’60s, von Kármán calculated that if he himself had held ontohis stock he w ould have been worth $12 million.But it was hard to resist the offer Aerojet General was making. The war wasending, the futur e was uncertain, the gr oup had achie ved what they intendedto achie ve with r ockets, and no w A erojet was offering them $50,000 apiecefor their stock. Charles Bartle y remembers Parsons and Forman coming into hisoffice at JPL quite excited, bragging how they had managed to get out of thecompan y while they were still ahead. The w ar was over, they told him, and rockets were finished. The field had no futur e. They were going to start a chainof laundr omats with their mone y and become rich men. It is difficult tounderstand how the two obviously passionate men could have given up their youthful goals about r ockets so easily, particularly since they still hadn’tlaunched anything into space.In fact, P arsons had actually sold out befor e the w ar ended and intended tocontinue his hazar dous passions . In a letter dated December 14, 1944 to Gr adyMcMurtry, Parsons wrote that he had “sold out at Aerojet, purchased 1003 [S.Orange Grove Ave.], and am starting a ne w company engaged in chemical research.” Evidently interested in other danger ous pursuits, he added that he was trying to get the e x-High Priestess R egina K ahl to r eturn to the lodge .In apparent response to a question fr om McMurtry as to whether he could sendParsons anything from Europe, Parsons replied “a witch, young, red headed . . .”His letters to McMurtry are full of references to Europe being “witch country.”The “lady-killer” Parsons did not confine his sexual largesse to his private world, ho wever. Indeed, both he and F orman w ere w ell-known around the Aerojet office as w ell, and the office manager s cringed when the y sa w the randy pair come in because both men seemed to be w orking their w ay through thesecr etarial pool. Each had had affair s with se veral women there, according tothose who knew them then, and their relationships with these women interferedwith the secretaries’ work to the point of disruption. But the y were thefounders, and their pr esence had to be toler ated until they sold out and left.Zwicky claimed that Hale y had actually convinced Parsons to sell out prior tothe Gener al Tire buyout, simply because of his pr oblems at the office , but von Kármán and other s disagree with Zwicky on this count. Parsons told Rypinskithat he left because Aerojet was less inter ested in r esearch and mor einterested in pr oduction and sales. However, Parsons did not get back into research after he left.Parsons and Forman formed Adastra Research, a small explosives company that w asinvestigated for “ espionage” when the tw o were caught with a lar ge quantityof “x-nitr ate,” a powerful explosive. It was determined that the compound hadbeen pr ocured for e xperimental reasons, and the charges were dropped. Parsonsthen went to work for the Vulcan Powder Company in Pasadena, where he wouldremain for the next two years.Back in New Mexico, Robert Goddard had his o wn problems. At the end of the war, he fell into a depr ession, became ill, and died before the y ear w as out.Certainly his failur e with r ockets—and Caltech’s success—was a contributingfactor.In late A ugust of 1945, Lou Goldstone br ought L. R on Hubbar d over to meet Parsons, who lik ed Hubbar d immediately. As noted, Hubbard had been the modelfor D. Vance Wimple in White’s Rocket to the Mor gue. He told a lot of w arstories which, though har d to believe, were well-liked by most, and he fitright in with the unusual assortment of people who lived there.Hubbard had just come from the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in San Francisco andcomplained of v arious ailments including rheumatism, arthritis, hemorrhoids,conjunctivitis, and aches in his side , shoulder, stomach, and knee. Afterseveral hospital visits, Hubbard was given a medical dischar ge from the Navyand began r eceiving financial benefits when he told them he could no longerpractice his livelihood of being a writer.The Parsons circle included not only a circuit connecting Hubbard and Cr owleybut also one linking Cr owley to Lo vecraft, whom Hubbard had met throughLovecraft biographer Frank Belknap Long. (Writers have tried for years to linkLovecraft and Crowley in one way or another, but this is a dir ect connectionthat has not y et been explored.) In addition, Hubbar d and Parsons associatedwith people in P asadena who had met Clark Ashton Smith, one of Lo vecraft’sregular corr espondents, as w ell as of Cr owley’s “inner cir cle.” Lovecraft’s“The Colour Out of Space” had appear ed in the September 1927 issue of AmazingStories, the publication Ed Forman had written about, so Parsons had probablyread it. He may also have read Weird Tales, which regularly featured the work ofLo vecraft in the teens and tw enties. Judging b y Cr owley’s remark in December1943 in his letter to Jane W olfe, this was simply the sort of “magazine trash”Parsons was reading.Parsons had begun his magical w ork with Betty, Helen’s younger sister, afterHelen had left with Smith. His encouragement of an open relationship, whichdemonstrated his evolution beyond petty human jealousy, was to backfire on him,however, as Betty readily agreed to take up other lo vers and ended up withHubbar d. The r elationship was to be a source of extreme aggravation forParsons, who suddenly had more than he could bear.Hubbard charmed P arsonage r esident Alv a R ogers, who, lik e Hubbard, was aredhead. Indeed, Hubbar d confided his belief that all r edheads descended fr omthe Neanderthal r ather than pur e Homo sapiens. “Needless to say,” Rogerswrote, “I was fascinated.” The redhead-Neanderthal connection is interesting tokeep in mind when reading Williamson’ s Darker Than Y ou Think, the story ofwerewolves who return to their atavistic state. Rogers further wrote:It all began on an other wise undistinguished day in the late fall of 1945 whenwe got word that L. Ron Hubbard was planning to wait out his terminal leave fromthe Navy at “The Parsonage” . . . Short visits by such pr o authors as JackWilliamson, Edmond Hamilton, Tony Boucher, and other were fairly frequent; butRon was planning on an extended stay.Ron arrived on a Sunday, driving an oldish Packard and hauling a house trailerwhich he parked on the grounds behind the house. He originally intended stayingin the trailer , but within a few days someone moved out of the house and hemoved in.I liked Ron from the first. He was of medium build, red headed, wore horned rimglasses, and had a tr emendously engaging personality. For several weeks hedominated the scene with his wit and inexhaustible fund of anecdotes. About theonly thing he seemed to take seriously and be prideful of was his membership inthe Explorers Club (of which he was the youngest member) which he had receivedafter leading an expedition into the wilds of South America, or some suchgodforsaken place. Ron showed us scars on his body which he claimed wer e madeby aboriginal ar rows on this expedition . . . Unfortunately, Ron’s reputationfor spinning tall tales (both off and on the printed page) made for a certaindegree of skepticism in the minds of his audience. At any rate, he told one hellof a good stor y . . .Ron was a persuasive and unscrupulous charmer, not only in a social group, butwith the ladies. He was so persuasive and charmingly unscrupulous that within amatter of a few weeks he br ought the entire House of Parsons down around poorJack’s ears. He did this by the simple expedient of taking over Jack’s girl forextended periods of time . . . Ron was supposedly his best friend, and this wasmore than Jack was willing to tolerate . . .A reporter named Nieson Himmel also lived in the house, sharing room withHubbard, after the latter moved out of his trailer and into he house. Himmelwrote:Parsons was a superb chemist. He had this big old house up in Pasadena, amongsome huge old mansions. It was built by some rich people at the turn of thecentury. The coach houses were still back there . . . His specialty wasexplosives. He was a follower of Aleister Cr owley. He used to have meetingsther e. I knew him through science fiction, we had meetings of the sciencefiction society out there. They used to have these meetings come down the stairsin black r obes. There were two pyramid sor t of things where they held theirser vices. He converted the place into apar tments, about 19 of them. He put anad in the paper, “Apartments for rent. (This was at the end of the war when noone could find a place to live.) Must not believe in God.”There was an Englishman [Wilfr ed Smith] living in the coach house who was oneof the original Crowley followers. Parsons made no secret that he was a follower. There were woodcuts in Cr owley books and Parsons had some of the originals.There were two crowds out there—science fiction and Crowley . . .Parsons was living with a beautiful girl called Betty Nor thrup who I understandcame from a rich family. She was beautiful, just lovely. This girl did not getmar ried. Hubbard came in, he was ir resistible to women, swept girls of f theirfeet. There were other girls living there with guys and he went through them oneby one. Finally he fastened onto Betty. Parsons was desperately in love, butcould not countenance marriage because of his beliefs. The atmosphere became very tense. Y ou would sit at the table and the hostility between Hubbard andParsons was tangible . . . Betty was not her name, Sara was her name. Everyoneknew her as Betty, beautiful, sweet as nice could be, she had dr opped out ofschool to be with Parsons . . .There was a bunch of people there, 18-20 in the big house and 5-6 in the coachhouse. When he br oke it up into apar tments, I think there were about 19 ofthem. The atmospher e became so tense . . . Lou Goldstone, an artist, was livingthere and he was my entree to the place . . .I think Lou Goldstone intr oduced Hubbar d to the house. Although I thinkParsons was an early science fiction fan.Lou said he stumbled into a couple of meetings. I pr esume it was a black mass.People talked about it quite openly . . .Betty was beautiful—the most gor geous, intelligent, sweet, wonderful person. Iwas so much in love with her , but I knew she was a woman I could never have . .. Betty was a raving beauty .Alva Rogers was my first roomer, then Ron.Himmel went on to a long car eer in crime writing and per sonally knew severalmob bosses, including Bugsy Siegel and Mickey Cohen. He died in March 1999 atthe age of 77.Concerning Parsons’ growing resentment towards the Hubbar d-Betty affair, Rogerswrote:Although the three of them [ Parsons, Hubbard, and Betty] continued to maintaina sur face show of unchanged amicability , it was obvious that Jack was feelingthe pangs of a hitherto unfelt passion.As events progressed, Jack found it increasingly difficult to keep his mind onanything but the torrid affair going on between Ron and Betty and the atmospherearound the house became supercharged with tension . . . In the end, Jack reacted as any or dinary man would under similar circumstances.In September 1945, Hubbard was declared unfit for service due to an ulcer andleft the P arsonage to go to the hospital for a while to strengthen hisdisability claim. T o his cr edit, Hubbar d was sending what little he had tohis wife and children, who were still living with his parents in Washingtonstate.In early December, Hubbard was “mustered out” of the Navy. The very ne xt da yhe applied to the V A for his pension, claiming a sprained left knee, malaria,and other maladies. He told them he was a writer, that his income had been $65 0per month befor e the w ar, and that no w it w as zer o. Then he hopped into hisP ackard and pulled his small tr ailer to the P asadena, returning to the Parsonage and resuming his affair with Betty.Alva Rogers was one who r ealized the true pain hidden beneath Parsons’ cavalierfront. He wr ote of an accidental peek caught one night through the cracked-opendoor:As events progressed, Jack found it incr easingly difficult to keep his mind onanything else . . . the atmospher e around the house became supercharged withtension; Jack began to show more and more strain, and the effort to disguise hismetamorphosis from an emotionless Cr owleyite ‘super man’ to a jealousy-riddenhuman being became hopeless . . .The final, desperate act on Jack’s par t to reverse events and salvage somethingof the past from the ruin that stared him in the face occur red in the still,early hours of a bleak mor ning in December. Our r oom was just acr oss the hallfr om Jack’s apar tment, the largest in the house, which also doubled as atemple, or whatever, of the OTO. We were brought out of a sound sleep by someweird and disturbing noises seemingly coming fr om Jack’s room which sounded forall the world as though someone wer e dying or at the very least were deathlyill. We went out into the hall to investigate the source of the noises and foundthat they came from Jack’s par tially open door. Perhaps we should have tur nedaround and gone back to bed at this point, but we didn’t. The noise—which, bythis time, we could tell was a sort of chant—drew us inexorably to the doorwhich we pushed open a little fur ther in order to better see what was going on.What we saw I’ll never forget, although I find it har d to describe in anydetail. The r oom, in which I had been before, was decorated in a manner typicalto any occultist’s lair, with all the symbols and appur tenances essential tothe proper practice of black magic. It was dimly lit and smoky from incense;Jack was draped in a black r obe and stood with his back to us, his ar msoutstretched, in the center of a pentagram before some sort of altar affair onwhich several indistinguishable items stood.His voice, which was actually not ver y loud, rose and fell in a rhythmic chantof gibberish which was deliver ed with such passionate intensity that itsmeaning was frighteningly obvious. After this brief and uninvited glimpse intothe blackest and most secr et center of a tortured man’s soul, we quietlywithdrew and returned to our room, where we spent the balance of the nightdiscussing in whispers what we had just witnessed . . .The ritual seems to ha ve w orked, at least tempor arily. After Hubbard’sreturn, Parsons wrote in his diary, “I have been suffered to pass thr ough an ordeal of human lo ve and jealous y . . . I ha ve found a staunch companion andcomrade in Ron . . . R on and I are to continue with our plans for the Or der.”They did so a fe w days later, on January 4, 1946. P arsons wrote to Cr owleyaround this time:Most Beloved Father,About three months ago I met Capt. L. Ron Hubbar d, a writer and explorer ofwhom I had known for some time . . . He is a gentleman; he has red hair, greeneyes, is honest and intelligent, and we have become gr eat friends. He moved inwith me about two months ago, and although Betty and I ar e still friendly , shehas transferred her sexual affections to him.Although Ron has no formal training in Magick, he has an extraordinary amount ofexperience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deducehe is in dir ect touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his Guar dianAngel. He describes his Angel as a beautiful winged woman with red hair whom hecalls the Empress, and who has guided him thr ough his life and saved him manytimes . . . Recently , he says, because of some danger, she has called the Archangel Michael to guar d us . . . Last night after invoking, I called him in,and he described Isis nude on the left, and a faint figure of past, partlymistaken operations on the right, and a rosewood box with a string of greenbeads, a string of pearls with a black cr oss suspended, and a r ose . . . He isthe most thelemic person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our ownprinciples. He is also interested in establishing the New Aeon but for cogentreasons I have not introduced him to the Lodge.We are pooling our resources in a partnership that will act as a limited companyto contr ol our business ventur es. I think I have made a great gain, and asBetty and I are the best of friends there is little loss. I cared for her deeplybut I have no desir e to control her emotions, and I can, I hope, contr ol myown.I need a magical partner. I have many experiments in mind . . . The next time Itie up with a woman it will be on my own ter ms.Thy son, John.Even at 30, Parsons was still young enough and immature enough to be quite impressionable and vulner able, despite the fact that he had gone through repeatedupheavals during his short life. He was a romantic, a poet—not a businessman.Hubbar d made a big impr ession on him, so much so that P arsons forgot hisobligation and violated his oath to the Or der, revealing to Hubbar d the secrets of the highest grades of the OTO—grades which P arsons himself ma y not haveactually held but mer ely had access to some of the documents associated withthem. However, two of his letters refer to himself as holding this grade, so thematter is unclear. He may have been exaggerating again.With the w ar ended and the business buy out, it seems Parsons had a lot of timeon his hands and thr ew himself into the magical work, possibly also as a distraction from and remedy for his painful experience with Betty and Hubbar d. The“magical partner” P arsons envisioned was to be his partner in a “w orking” ofsexual magic—probably not a IX°, but one of his own devising that fell welloutside the system of the OTO. Parsons was known to invoke spirits calledelementals, so-called because of their association with the four elements of theancients: Earth, Air, Water, Fire. The classical symbols associated with eachare usually gnomes, sylphs, mermaids, and salamanders, r espectively. These are, of cour se, just s ymbols, such that modern replacements for each could befound: F or example, UFOs, perhaps, would be a good replacement for sylphs.According to Cr owley, to summon an elemental r equires a lar ge amount ofmagical energy, the kind said to be gener ated by an VIII° working, the VIII°being a solo se xual rite, i.e ., masturbation. As Parsons once wr ote, “The invocation of lesser for ces (spirit, angel, demon, elemental) is e xact, since love doesn’t usually enter in so much, in one sense [it is] far mor e danger ousthan inv ocation of Gods. In the higher w ork you are actually wooing the god—itis an act of art. In the lo wer you are compelling—it is an act of science .”(Whether Parsons actually followed the rites of the VIII° of the OTO is knownonly to initiates.)There ar e se veral w ays to go about doing what P arsons w as attempting, andhe wrote:The primar y methods ar e: 1. Goetia Daemonic, 2. Planetar y Clavicle of Solomon, 3. Enochian Elemental and Air es, 4. Solar Guardian Angel. I have found theEnochian the best (although complicated). The Tarot corresponds to the Enochiansystem obtained by Dr. Dee—the Trumps to the Aires, the Court Cards to the Gods,Seniors and Angels, and the numbers to the lesser angels.What it all boils down to is that Parsons experimented on his own withupper-degr ee OTO techniques usually char acterized as “se x magic,” i.e., toaffect or bring about e vents. In addition, he r emains the best example insupport of the OTO’s policy of keeping these techniques secret."},{"pageContent":"sixAn Intr oduction to Enochian MagicFrom Parsons’ ritual references and other aspects of the occult world in whichhe so ardently participated, we can piece together the atmosphere surroundinghis workings. For example, the Enochian s ystem r eferred to b y Parsons is aform of magic founded not b y the pr ophet Enoch but b y Dr. John Dee and SirEdward K elley in 16th-century England. Enochian magic is not necessarily sexualin nature; in fact, its Elizabethan originators deliberately refused injunctionstowards sexual immorality.John Dee was born July 13, 1527 in Mortlak e, England, a small village on theThames just outside of London. Dee was a bright boy, enrolling at the universityat the age of 15. He began a lar ge private library at his home and eventuallybecame proficient in various sciences including mathematics, navigation (much ofwhich he learned firsthand during his world travels), astronomy, optics, andcartography. He also studied the hermetic sciences and was appointed to be theRoyal Astrologer to Elizabeth I.Dee had been imprisoned b y Queen Mary after dr awing up an unfavorablehoroscope for her (at her r equest). Elizabeth pardoned him, and in addition tohis otherw orldly duties he also acted as an agent of espionage, signing hissecret communiqués to her “007.” He seems to have developed some sense ofesoteric duty to Elizabeth’ s person or position, as ther e is e vidence heidolized her as the Egyptian goddess Isis . Indeed, his “ esoteric duty” ma yeven have included an application of the famous INRI formula, the “key word”used in Crowley’s magic, in one of its many variations.Dee married relatively late, in 1574, at the age of 47. History does not r ecordthe name of the wife , who died the follo wing y ear. He remarried, this time toa Jane Fromond, one of the Queen’s ladies-in-waiting. Dee’s studies continuedindependently, and by 1581 he felt he had exhausted all known sources of worldlyknowledge and that the only way to continue his quest for knowledge was to turnto the otherworldly.A godly man, Dee w as a good Christian and a member of the Church of England. Headmir ed Enoch, the fir st man after the F all said to have walked with God.According to tradition, Enoch was the author of se veral apocryphal books , inwhich he w as said to ha ve recorded what he learned during these walks. Theselost books were in fact pseudepigraphical, i.e., not written by Enoch, but Deelonged to find them and proposed to do it with the help of angels .Addressing God, he pr ayed, “I ha ve read often in Th y books & records, howEnoch often injo yed Thy favour & conversation; with Moses thou was familiar;And also that to Abraham, Issack & Jocob, Joshua, Gideon, Esdr as, Daniel, Tobias & sundry other s Th y good angels w ere sent b y Th y disposition, toInstruct them, informe them, helpe them, y ea in w orldly and domestick affaires, y ea and sometymes to satisfie their desir es, doubtes & questions of Th ySecrete.”In his quest, Dee acquir ed from various sources several magical “shewstones,”with the intent of taking up cry stal-gazing. Try as he might, however, hecouldn’t do it, as he was just too logical a thinker and his r ational brainresisted all attempts to impose a tr ance state upon it. He decided he needed ahelper and enlisted the services of Edward Kelley, who had changed his name from Talbott. Kelley had a reputation as an alchemist; it was said he had producedgold once. It also seems he was something of a rogue. John Weever recorded thefollowing adventure of K elley’s in the 16th-century Ancient Funerall Monuments,the spelling of which appear s to have been somewhat modernized:This diabolical questioning of the dead for the knowledge of future accidentswas put into practice by the said Kelley, who, upon a certain night in the parkof W alton-le-Dale in the County of Lancaster with one Paul Waring (his fellowcompanion in such deeds of darkness) invocated some of the Infer nal Regiment,to know cer tain passages in the life, as also what might be known by theDevil’s foresight of the manner and time of the death of a noble younggentleman, as then in war dship. The black cer emonies of the night being ended,Kelley demanded of one of the gentleman’s servants what corse was the lastburied in Law chur chyard, a church thereunto adjoining, who told him of a poorman that was buried ther e but the same day. He and the said Waring entreatedthis foresaid servant to go with them to the grave of the man so lately interred, which he did; and withal did help them to dig up the carcase of the poorcaitif f, whom by their incantations they made him (or rather some evil spiritthr ough his or gans) to speak, who deliver ed strange predictions concerningthe said gentleman. I was told this by the said serving-man, a secondary actorin that dismal abhorred business, and divers gentlemen and others ar e nowliving in Lancashire to whom he hath related this story. And the gentlemanhimself (whose memory I am bound to honor) told me a little before his death ofthis conjuration of Kelley, as he had it by relation from his said ser vant andtenant, only some cir cumstances except, which he thought not fit to come to hismaster’s notice.Kelley, called “the crop-eared wizard” because he had had his ears cropped as apunishment for earlier sorceries, moved with his family into a room in Dee’ shouse, where they subsisted on a £5 0 per year salary paid by Dee.On a cold evening in 1582, March 8, Dee and Kelley sat down and gazed into oneof the she wstones. Impatient, Dee soon got up and moved to ward the fir e, butwithin 15 minutes K elley w as seeing angels. Dee came quickly but sa w nothingand became content to assume the role of scribe, recording what Kelley relayedhe was seeing.According to K elley, the angels sho wed him large tablets bearing unusualletter s, which supposedly formed the oldest language of them all: the languageof the angels . Kelley described the tablets to Dee, who wrote down what wassaid. The angel then pr oceeded to dictate the lost books of Enoch to K elley,by spelling them out letter-by-letter. The angel would point to a letter, andKelley would tell Dee which letter it was.During these tr ansmissions, K elley was so afr aid that the mer e mention ofthese letter s would be sufficient to inv oke demons, that he only would callout the row and column of each letter as the angel pointed to it. Dee w ouldthen look up the corr esponding letter and write it down. There were many moretablets, Kelley told Dee, which were not dictated.The books completed, the angel next dictated the 30 “Aethyrs” (or “Aires”) andtheir 19 Calls , which are for summoning angels to the caller, for the purposeof “scrying” or vie wing what w as in the Aethyr. The first five Calls wereconsidered so powerful that the angel dictated them backwards to avoid conjuringup the guardians of the corresponding Aethyrs; the remainder were dictated inthe usual way.The Aethyrs are likened to the spheres of the ancients , the planetary orbitsthought to surr ound the earth. A ccording to ancient mythology and r eligion,souls ascending to hea ven had to pass through each sphere in succession, aidedb y a series of holy names and passwords. Unsuccessful attempts led toreincarnation at best, or to hell. Tradition holds that many of the Aethyrs areguarded by harsh angels, even demons, who have no patience with men ormagicians.After the hazar dous dictation pr ocess was completed, the angel provided Kelley with the English tr anslations, which r equired that Dee had to go backover the entire collection of transcripts and substitute the English. Althougheach Enochian letter has its English counterpart, it is not a letter-for-lettersubstitution or a code The letter correspondences were only pr ovided as a pronunciation guide. An actual dictionary was dictated, and Dee had to tr anslateaccordingly. Enochian is thus a language unto itself, with its own grammar andsyntax. It is very succinct and has an odd relationship to English that it doesnot have with other languages. One example of Enochian is the w ord “Babalon,”meaning “harlot” in Enochian, as in the “Whore of Bab ylon.” The Enochian system being complicated, the entire process of dictation and tr anslation tookse ven years, from 1582 to 1589.Amazingly enough, considering the language’ s comple xity, the Enochian Callstranslate into English remarkably well. Regardless of the fact that they weredictated backwards and forwards, and that the translations were only pr ovidedlater, Enochian turned out to be a coherent language previously unknown to man.The Calls, when translated, are quite evocative, and contain some very beautifulpassages . Although it could easily be claimed K elley was making the wholething up, the Calls were nothing at all like his usual writing style, which wasquite crude even when he wrote verse. It seems improbable for Kelley to havedefrauded Dee in this regard, as the system is just too immense and w ellstructured.Along with the Calls w ere dictated instructions , such as when scrying or crystal-gazing the tw o were to arr ange a special cedar table, ar ound theperimeter of which w as inscribed in Enochian, “This is the place of theoutpouring of for gotten treasure in the form of ecstasy. Only fire issubstantial her e. This is the w ay of Babalon and of the Beast who is the first form. The eyes only need rest upon the name of an y guar dian and its representative will speedily be encountered.” The whole thing is scr ambled inthe original, and the name “Babalon” is e xtremely so, in or der to a voidsummoning the Harlot.In addition, a special ring and r obes had to be w orn. Some of these artifactsare preserved in the British Museum. The angels pr ovided additional messages asw ell, some of which w ere cause for great concern on the part of Dee and Kelly. These communications parallel unorthodox messages received from19th-century fairies and 20th-century occupants of UFOs. For example, at onepoint Dee and Kelley were told:1. That Jesus was not God.2. That no prayer ought to be made to Jesus.3. That there is no sin.4. That man’s soul doth go fr om one body to another childes quickening [i.e.,reincarnation].5. That as many men and women as are now, have always been.6. That the generation of mankind fr om Adam and Eve, is not historical butallegorical.Such seemingly blasphemous messages made K elley balk, and he grew more and morereticent to continue with their work. Dee had a devil of a time keeping him on,despite the £5 0 salary. The stress of the constant scrying once sent K elleyrunning into the str eet like a madman, at which point Dee had to catch him andcalm him do wn.However, being a pious man, Dee had occasional misgivings himself. At one pointhe burned his entire collection of “angelick” works, allegedly to find thr ee ofhis books intact a fe w days later. Another time K elley knock ed o ver a lampand accidentally burned se veral valuable manuscripts of Dee’s.Other messages w ere less oner ous, such as one instance in which the angelsupposedly began dictating in Greek. Kelley, however, did not kno w Greek andsoon thr eatened to stop dictating if the angel per sisted with this “Ghybbrish.” Nevertheless, enough came through for Dee to r ecognize the message asa w arning not to trust Kelley.According to the story, the angel later told Dee and Kelley to swap wives, butthe tw o were so shock ed at this message that the y and their wives all signeda pact (at Dee’s prompting) never to reveal this message to an yone. As noted,the br eaking of r eligious and se xual taboos, from the eating of meat and wineto incest and homose xuality, is considered a part of tantra. The shock isintended to decondition the initiate from his usual lifestyle. In the case ofDee and Kelley, living in prudish Elizabethan England, it w as asking toomuch—at least for no w. They did finally per suade their wiv es to agr ee tothis seeming commandment from God: Dee recorded in his diary on May 3, 1587, “I,John Dee, Edward Kelley and our two wives, covenanted with God and subscribedthe same , for indissoluble and inviolable unities, charity and friendship keeping betw een us four , and all things between us to be common, as God bysundry means willed us to do.”Dee and Kelley left Mortlake for a tour of Europe in 1583, continuing their workwith the angels as they traveled. When they returned in 1587, the y w erehorrified to see that a super stitious mob had sacked Dee’s house and burned thecontents, destroying most of his valuable library.Undeterred by such a faith-destr oying event, the tw o continued, their workwith the Calls ending one da y when K elley was scrying alone in the 7th Air e,during which time he r eceived the follo wing proto-thelemic message:I am the daughter of For titude and ravished ever y hour fr om my youth. Forbehold, I am Understanding, and science dwelleth in me; and the heavens oppressme. They cover and desir e me with infinite appetite; for none that are earthlyhave embraced me, for I am shadowed with the Circle of the Stars, and coveredwith the morning clouds. My feet ar e swifter than the winds, and my hands ar esweeter than the mor ning dew. My gar ments are from the beginning, and mydwelling place is in myself. The Lion knoweth not where I walk, neither do thebeasts of the field understand me. I am deflowered, yet a virgin; I sanctify andam not sanctified. Happy is he that embraceth me: for in the night season I amsweet, and in the day full of pleasure. My company is a harmony of many symbols,and my lips sweeter than health itself. I am a harlot [BABALON] for such asravish me, and a vir gin with such as know me not. Pur ge your str eets, O yesons of men, and wash your houses clean; make yourselves holy , and put onrighteousness. Cast out your old strumpets, and burn their clothes and then Iwill bring forth children unto you and they shall be the Sons of Comfort in theAge that is to come.The entire passage is r eminiscent of the gnostic te xt, “Thunder Perfect Mind,”unearthed at Nag Hammadi in 1945 but written at least 1700 years earlier.This message w as the last str aw for K elley, and he finally snapped, robbingDee of a lar ge sum and lea ving town with Dee’ s wife. The two did not returnbut ended up in Germany, where Kelley endeared himself to the Emperor. Focusinghis attention increasingly on practical alchemy, Kelley was soon knighted butwas later imprisoned (either for killing a man or simply to k eep him close tothe Emperor), and died during an attempt to escape . Dee w as also imprisonedwhen James I, patron of the King James Bible, ascended to the English throne in160 3. Despite his own personal, extrabiblical peccadilloes, the pious KingJames was scared of magic and put a quick end to Dee’ s career as royalastrologer.Dee was subsequently put on trial for witchcr aft but was acquitted and spenthis remaining years penniless. In 1608, he died, financially ruined butspiritually whole , appar ently ha ving used the Enochian s ystem for little more than the satisfaction of his o wn curiosity. The paper s he had hidden a waynear the end of his life were not found for 1 00 years, and his diary w as notfound for 2 00 years, but for at least one later student Dee’s personal tragedywould eerily appear to repeat itself.As is well known in the world of the esoteric and occult, cry stal-gazing is notthe only w ay one ma y scry in the A ethyrs, as tantric energy, or se x magick,may also be used to induce the same sort of ecstatic states that K elley used solong ago. The pr ovocative Parsons used this method, as did his libidinousmentor Crowley, who claimed to be the reincarnation of K elley, although thatrole would in reality be played to Parsons’ Dee by another man in his per sonaldrama. In addition, Crowley further heightened his a wareness through the use ofpsychoactive drugs (see his Liber LXXXIV vel Chanokh). Crowley’s The Diary of aDrug Fiend , both w ell-received and vilified, w as accused of encour aging drugabuse . During the cour se of his life , Crowley consumed massiv e amounts ofalcohol, opium, cocaine , hashish, peyote and heroin, to which he was addictedat his death.Like Dee and K elley, Parsons eventually found himself in tr ouble, seemingly atthe hands of the infamous Babalon, the Enochian Whore of Babylon, thetraditional spirit of Rome who subjugated the children of Israel. Babalon, asthe Harlot, is also a symbol of the material world in general, the root “mater”also meaning “mother,” as in “Mother of Abominations.” Adherents to the Jamaicanr eligion of R astafari use her this sensual w ay, as any listener of r eggaemusic might kno w. A similar symbol for certain gnostic sects in the Middle Eastw as the “Land of the Dead,” i.e ., Egypt. Like Egypt, Bab ylon was the land ofcorruption to the composers of the Bible, as in Revelation 17:3-6:He [the angel] car ried my spirit away to the deser t. I saw the Scarlet Womansitting on the Beast with seven heads and ten horns, covered with blasphemousnames. The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold andprecious stones and pearls, with a golden cup in her hand filled withabominations and the unclean things of her fornication. On her forehead a namehad been written, a myster y: Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots and ofthe abominations of the Earth. I saw the woman was drunk from the blood of theSaints, and from the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. Seeing her, I wonderedgreatly.According to P arsons, Babalon is the gnostic Sophia, slighted b y John theRevelator, but justifiably so, as she is still in her fallen state. John failsto offer her r edemption. She is also the Helen of Simon Magus mentioned b y Parsons in his Analysis By A Master of the Temple. She is the Chokmah of theKabbalah, the Holy Wisdom who cries out in the first and eighth Psalms, foldedinto the Shekhinah of the Hebrews.The Greek name Babylon is derived from the Semitic Bab-Il, meaning “the gate ofGod.” At one time or another every holy city believed it was at the center ofthe w orld, the mystical center where the gate between the upper and lo wer worlds is located. So it is with Jerusalem today for three of the world’s majorreligions, with Benares for the Hindus, and with Mecca and R ome. Like so manyother r eligious symbols, however, gates have a sexual symbolism as well.The Hebrew for “gate of God” is Bab-Al, usually written Bab-El or simply Babel.The name (actually a title) of God usually translated El (if tr anslated at all)is actually spelled with an “ A” (or aleph in Hebrew).Although he no doubt follo wed the Enochian spelling, Cr owley claimed to ha ve“ corrected” “Bab ylon” to “Babalon” to giv e what was to him a meaningfulgematria, a term used b y medieval Jewish scholars to describe the ancient practice of substituting number s for the letters in a word or name and addingthem up to get a significant result. Gematria comes fr om a Gr eek w ord meaning“to measur e (land),” and this practice dates at least to Bab ylon, when singleletters were used to stand for numbers rather than spelling them out. In an agethat has used Ar abic numerals for centuries, the significance of thisachievement may be hard to appreciate.In this system of numeration, A = 1, B = 2, and so on. After the 10th letter (“I” in the Hebrew and Greek alphabets, sometimes written as “Y”) there was noneed for an 11 since “IA” stood for a 10 followed by a 1, which is the w ay weform numer als in our base 1 0 system. Eleven, in fact, is Cr owley’s “number ofmagick.” The 1 1th letter is “ K,” which, accor ding to gematria, equals 2 0,and so on. Thus BABYLON = 2 + 1 + 2 + 400 + 80 + 800 + = 1335, which is not ameaningful result.In the Book of R evelation the original Gr eek is BABYLON with an upsilon (Y),rather than an alpha, while the final vowel is not omicron but is the long “o,”omega. Crowley’s “corrected” spelling BABALON = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 30 + 70 + 50 =156, a number significant to John Dee as the pr oduct of 12 and 13, thedimensions of the table upon which he received the Enochian alphabet from theangel.Crowley referred to the number 156 as that of the “City of the Pyramids,” whereinitiates would spend the “Night of Pan.” Babylon was known for its ziggur ats,stepped pyramids built for the gods to descend and humans to ascend, serving asa model for the biblical Tower of Babel, also immortalized in the 16th car d ofthe Tarot.In the Enochian s ystem, the City of the Pyr amids lies in the 14th Aire, abovewhich (i.e ., 13th) is the Gar den of Nemo, Nemo being Enochian for “Master ofthe T emple.” The 12th Air e belongs to Babalon, and the 11th is called the HolyCity The 10th Aire will be discussed in a later chapter. While Dee and K elleymay have discovered the Enochian system and Babalon the Harlot, Parsons was tomake the latter more infamous.23 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-23]027 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_027_r1.gif]"},{"pageContent":"sevenThe Babalon Working, Part 1: Januar y-Febr uar y 1946Now that he had achie ved extraordinary success in his physical jet propulsion,it seems Parsons was intent on creating high-flying adventures on themetaphysical plane. In early 1946, using the Angelic language of John Dee andEdw ard Kelley, P arsons planned his magick al oper ation, k eeping diligentrecords per Cr owley’s constant advice . The surviving fr agments of Parsons’Babalon W orking have been cir culated since the da ys of mimeograph machines,and ar e widely posted on the W orld Wide Web. They are not a part of Freedom IsA Two-Edged Sword, though the near futur e may see collected writings of John Parsons printed under one cover.The working began January 4, 1946. At 9 p.m. Parsons wrote, “I followed thisprocedure for eleven days, from January 4 to 15,” which is actually 12 days.Presumably, Parsons miscounted and carried on the working for one e xtra day, asimple mistak e difficult to belie ve of a rocket scientist.To begin the working, Parsons chose one of the squar es from the Enochian “AirTablet” (there are four 12-b y-13 tablets, one for each element), also known asthe “Great Watch-Tower of the East.” He did not record which of the 156 possiblesquares he chose. After preparing the other magical w eapons, at 9 p.m. he prepared and consecrated his “Air Dagger.” An actual dagger purchased for thispurpose, the weapon, he said, was the “special talisman of the oper ation.”Parsons then copied the s ymbols contained within the chosen square onto virginparchment. These symbols consist of one of the seven planetary signs, one of the12 zodiacal signs, a unique permutation of the four signs of the elements, andan Enochian letter in the center. Present as “Scribe” for the entir e operationwas none other than Hubbar d, in what w ould e ventually r esemble the Dee-Kelley operation. The ritual was ready to begin.Parsons fir st inv oked the “P entagram of Air ,” a fiv e-pointed star traced inthe air with the dagger. It starts at the upper right-hand point of the star,representing water, goes left to wards air, then tr aces the remainder of thestar thr ough fir e (lo wer right), spirit (top), earth (lower left), then backto water. As he proceeds in the ritual, the magician must visualize the outlineof the pentagram in brilliant purple (different for each element inv oked) as well as the s ymbol of air in the center. This ritual includes the oft-hear drecitation invoking the four archangels as representatives of the four cardinaldirections, and hence the four elements. “Before me, Raphael; Behind me,Gabriel,” etc.Parsons probably should ha ve invoked with the he xagram next, which is the w aythe rite usually goes , but he does not r ecord this being done. It may be thathe assumed this step w as understood, or that he deliberately left it out of hiswriting to deter prying eyes from repeating his oper ation. There are he xagramsinvoked later in the operation, during the inv ocation of the “Six Senior s,”and he ma y have felt these were sufficient.Next Parsons recited from memory the “Invocation of the Bornless One,” a shortinvocation translated by Crowley and appearing at the beginning of his andMathers’ translation of the Goetia, or Lesser Key of Solomon. It starts:Thee I invoke, the Bornless One.Thee, that didst create the Earth and the Heavens.Thee, that didst create the Night and the Day.Thee, that didst create the Darkness and the Light.Thou art Osorronophris, whom no man hath seen at any time.Thou art Jabas.Thou art Japos.Thou hast distinguished between the Just and the Unjust.Thou didst make the Female and the Male.Thou didst produce the Seed and the Fruit.Thou didst form Men to love one another, and to hate one another.I am Mosheh [Moses] Thy Prophet, unto whom Thou didst commitThy Mysteries, the Ceremonies of Ishrael [sic].Thou didst pr oduce the moist and the dr y, and that which nourishethall created Life.Dear Thou Me, for I am the Angel of Paphr o Osorronophris; this isThy True Name, handed down to the Prophets of Ishrael . . .”The original inv ocation is tr aditionally ascribed to Moses , but it bears anEgyptian flavor reflecting the mysteries of Egypt, into which the Bible saysMoses was initiated. Later v ersions “corrected” some of the spellings to bringthem in line with Cr owley’s w ork: “Osorronophris” became ASAR UN-NEFER (a formof Osiris), for example. It w ould ha ve been this corr ected v ersion that Parsons used. The complete text can be found in “Liber Samekh” in Cr owley’sMagick, and represents the lengthy rite Crowley used at Boleskine to attain tothe Kno wledge and Conv ersation of his Holy Guar dian Angel and thus to the 6°=5 of the A∴A∴, in the v ersion quoted abo ve. Although evidently undocumented,it is possible that success during this ritual would have allowed Parsons toclaim the 6°= 5 .Parsons next recorded a “Conjur ation of Air,” a “Consecr ation of the AirDagger” (appar ently a redundancy), and the K ey Call of the Third Aire, thelatter of which is not to be confused with the element Air. The dagger is one ofthe four standard magical weapons used by the magician. The other three are thepentacle (or disk), the cup, and the wand.24[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-24]It seems that P arsons actually r ecited the “Third Key” (or Thir d Call), whichis different from the Key Call of the Third Aire, as there is only one Key Callfor all 30 Aires. However, the Third Call is appropriate to summon EXARP, theAngel of the Air T ablet, so it seems to have been a mistak e in nomenclatur eonly. In other w ords, Parsons used the correct call but called it by the wrongname in his notes. The Third Key, in English, is:Behold! Saith your God! I am a circle on whose hands stand twelve Kingdoms. Sixar e the seats of living br eath: the r est are sharp Sickles, or the Horns ofDeath. Wherein the creatures of earth are and are not, except in mine own hands;which sleep and shall rise!In the first I made ye stewards, and placed ye in twelve seats of government:giving unto every one of you power successively over the 456 true ages of time:to the intent that from the highest vessels and the cor ners of your governments you might work my Power, pouring down the fires of life and increasecontinually on the earth. Thus you are become the skirts of Justice and Truth.In the name of the same your God, lift up, I say , yourselves!Behold! His Mercies flourish, and His Name is become mighty among us. In whom wesay: Move! Descend! And apply yourselves unto us as unto the par takers of HisSecr et Wisdom in your Creation.All this invocation should have been done from memory. Next was an Invocation ofGod and of the King associated with the Air T ablet. The Secret Name of Godassociated with the Air T ablet is ORO-IBAH-AOZPI, meaning “He who cries aloudin the place of desolation.” The King associated with the Air Tablet is namedBATAIVAH, which means “He whose v oice seems to ha ve wings .” These odd namesar e all formed fr om the letter s on the Enochian tablets tak en in differ entorder, much like a seek-and-find puzzle in the ne wspaper.Parsons ne xt inv oked the Six Senior s of the Air T ablet, whose names ar eHABIORO, AA OZXAIF, HTNMORD A, AHA OZAPI, AVTOTAR, and HIPOTGA. They areequivalent to the “airy” parts of Mars, Jupiter, the Moon, Venus, Mercury, andSaturn, r espectively—six of the se ven “planets” visible to the nak ed eye, theseventh (the King) being the Sun, the same as the se ven days of the w eek,albeit in a differ ent order. The Kings and Seniors are each invoked with theirown special hexagram, in this case a He xagram of Air. Thus Parsons drew sevenconsecutive hexagrams in the air, visualizing the appropriate names and colorsand pronouncing the names, then addressing each in turn, individually, withcertain Enochian greetings. Again, from memory.The next step is rather hazy in the record. Parsons says he invoked “blank byblank and blank to visible appearance.” OTO scholars have filled in the firstand last blanks, but the middle one remains a mystery. This first is written asRDZA, by which is sur ely meant ARDZA, Enochian for “He who pr otects,” one ofthe “Calvary Cross” names, another long series that forms a certain pattern ofletter s traced out on the four elemental tablets.ARDZA is the name that controls the force of the “Air of Air” (upper left)quadrant of the Air Tablet. This force, not recorded by Parsons, is namedIDOIGO, “He who sits on the Holy Throne.” Since the upper left is where theletters ARDZA (in Enochian) appear on the Air Tablet, the proximate name IDOIGOis probably what Parsons left unrecorded in the middle blank, as that is theonly possible complement to ARDZA in this rite.The last blank is filled in with the name EXARP, again the Angel of the AirTablet, who controls all forces associated with the element of Air, the Kingsand Senior s being invoked merely to preside over the rite. Parsons would havebeen facing the dir ection of the pr evailing winds in Pasadena while invokingEXARP and, indeed, throughout the entire ceremony.25[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-25]The next statement is the simplest in Parsons’ magical record, yet it is alsothe most important. P arsons merely writes, “Invocation of wand with materialbasis on talisman,” the “material basis” of which is the “Marr ow of the Wand,”the Wand, of course, representing the penis or phallus of the magician, whilethe Marr ow is the semen. During the rite, the magician is to inv oke the spiritand, while concentrating upon it, masturbate o ver the talisman. P arsons herewas “energizing,” even “fertilizing” the little par chment square bearing thechosen squar e from the Air Tablet, the form s ympathetic magic takes: asymbolic fertilizing of Parsons’ desire through a very literal application ofthe usual means of fertilization. Crude , perhaps, but traditional.Parsons then wrote “Invocation with [Air] Dagger,” presumably an invocation ofthe elemental he wished to attr act, although he does not say. Lastly ar e the“License to Depart,” a purification, and the banishings, which ar e a sign thatthe rite is o ver. The License to Depart is in the Goetia, or Lesser Key ofSolomon, which Mathers and Crowley had translated years earlier. The firstEnglish-language edition appeared in 1903.The License to Depart runs, “O thou Spirit N. [name of spirit, in this caseEXARP], because thou has diligently answered unto my demands, and hast been very ready and willing to come at m y call, I do her e license thee to departunto thy proper place; without causing harm or danger unto man or beast. Depart,then, I say, and be thou very ready to come at m y call, being duly e xorcisedand conjured by the sacred rites of magic. I charge thee to withdr aw peaceablyand quietly, and the peace of God be e ver continued betw een thee and me!Amen!” The invocation also occur s in Cr owley’s later Magick, as w ell as inother texts by various authors.Banishings ar e as equally inv olved as the inv ocations, as the y involverecreating (or, rather, “erasing”) the v arious hexagrams and finally thepentagram in reverse of the original way they were traced. Needless to say, thisis a very long ceremony, lasting at least an hour, and again, all fr om memory.All the Kings and Senior s have to be banished, one at a time . Inter estingly,the pr ocedure outlined her e from the initial pentagr am to the final banishingis slightly differ ent from the textbook Enochian invocations. Parsons must haveimpr ovised somewhat.In 1943, Parsons had published a brief poem in the Oriflamme, an OTOpublication:I hight Don Quixote, I live on peyote,marijuana, morphine and cocaine,I never know sadness, but only a madnessthat burns at the heart and the brain. I see each charwoman, ecstatic, inhuman,angelic, demonic, divine.Each wagon a dragon, each beer mug a flagonthat brims with ambrosial wine.As documented by John S ymonds and Robert Anton Wilson, narcotics andhallucinogens were a basic staple of Crowley’s magical diet, as the y e xist inesoteric cer emonies of se veral r eligions. Cr owley recorded using these drugsin his Confessions, as well as in the published portions of his Magical R ecord.Within the world of magick, it is well known that it is easier to induce astr alvision when one alternately dulls and e xcites the senses b y chemical means .Indeed, the role of drugs in magick is common, and it is fairly certain theywere a part of the Babalon Working. In The Book of Law, (AL II:22), for example,Cr owley wrote, “To worship me [Nuit] tak e wine and str ange drugs whereof Iwill tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof!” In addition, Helen Parsons Smith toldan intervie wer that Parsons got into drugs after their split in 1943, the sameyear he wrote his Don Quixote poem and three years before the Babalon Working.Apparently she had been his anchor to r eality, and, once she w as gone, he waswide open to just about anything. She continued to follo w the path of whitemagick, she said, while he turned do wn another, darker path.Parsons’ drug use also manifests itself in “Nar cissus,” one of his poems fromhis later collection Songs for the Witch Woman, which is dedicated to Cameron,the woman Parsons would claim to be the elemental he had purportedly inv okedduring the Babalon W orking. “Narcissus” reads:Drug me with drugsSlow acting, sensuous, sweet,Co-mingle gin and musk,Hashish and amber,Let me drink and breatheAnd hear slow, devious musicUntil arousedTo subtle, languorous moods,Until I seeOchre and mazarine and purpleEmit lascivious sounds.Then I shall goThrough dark and gothic ruins,Gray and golden mistsDown to a forest, greenWith an old dream.I shall go nakedAnd magnolia and oleanderDatura and jasmine,When blossoms will open and vaginally flowerIn infinite time, for a relative hour,Whose white, subliminal flowersWill caress my breasts.And I shall perform statelyPhallic arabesquesIn the moonlight,Pale and white.The possibly drug-enhanced w orking continued the e vening of January 5, whenParsons noted “a strong windstorm beginning suddenly about the middle of the first invocation,” which was no surprise, as EXARP is the Angel of the Air Tablet.In writing, the “ first invocation,” Parsons was referring to the fact that he repeated the entire rite after finishing it the fir st time. The entire processtook a full two hours, such that Parsons must have been reciting at break-neckspeed to finish so soon.On January 6, Parsons continued the invocation, which means he ran through theentire rite twice. The windstorm also continued. On January 7, he inv oked twicemor e, and the wind subsided. A t this point he began pla ying Ser gei Prokofiev’s Violin Concerto No. 2 as background music; the actual r ecording ofwhich is still a vailable to the diligent searcher. 26[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-26]The w orking continued, and on January 8 P arsons wr ote, “Invoked twice, usingblood” (pr esumably as a substitute for the “material basis” of January 4, orelse applied to the W and directly à la Crowley’s Mass of the Phoenix).On January 9, he wr ote, “Inv oked twice, r eplenishing material basis,” whichevidently means he did not apply the “material basis” (semen) to the talisman(the little par chment square) on the nights of the 5th through the 8th. In thisse x magick, it seems he “inv oked the w and” (gained an er ection) but deliberately denied himself release so the secr etions (sperm) created would beabsorbed b y the body, a pr actice found in tantr a. This “magical masturbation”w as evidently carried out in front of the Scribe, i.e., Hubbard.On January 1 0, Parsons invoked twice and r etired to bed ar ound 11 p.m. He wasawakened at midnight b y nine loud, une xplainable knocks.27[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-27] When Parsons got out of bed to investigate the knocks, he noticed a lamp la y smashed on the floor , which shouldha ve been taken as an omen, as it is not the desired result and represents amagical misdirection of energy. Parsons recognized as much in his record, butcontinued regardless. Considering Hubbard was the Scribe during this ritual, itis an interesting coincidence that HUBARD means “living lamps” in Enochian, asis the fact that a knock ed-over lamp features in Dee and Kelley’s enterprise aswell.On January 11, Parsons wrote, “Invoked twice, using blood,” and on the 12th,“Inv oked twice. A heavy windstorm.” The inv ocations and the windstorm bothcontinued on the 13th.January 14 w as the second-to-last da y of the w orking—a v ery interesting day.As Parsons began invoking at 9 p.m., the electricity went out. Parsons recordsthat “another magician who had been staying in the house and studying with me was carrying a candle across the kitchen when he w as struck str ongly on theright shoulder, and the candle knocked out of his hand.” According to Cameronand others, this other magician was Hubbard, which is odd in that Hubbar d wasconsistently referred to as “Scribe” throughout Parsons’ record of the BabalonWorking, rather than “magician,” indicating the r ecord may have been garbledhere.He [the other “magician”] called us [the “us” appar ently referring to Parsonsand some unknown other] and we observed a brownish yellow light about seven feethigh in the kitchen. I banished with a magical sword, and it disappeared. His[the other magician’s] right arm was paralyzed for the rest of the night. The final day was January 15, when Parsons wrote: At this time the Scribe [Hubbar d] developed some sor t of astral vision,describing in details an old enemy of mine of whom he had never heard [CaptainKynette, the car-bombing cop?], and later the guardian for ms of Isis and the Archangel Michael. Later , in my room, I heard the [nine] raps again, and abuzzing, metallic voice crying “let me go fr ee.” I felt a gr eat pressure andtension in the house that night, which was also noticed by the other occupants.There was no other phenomena, and I admit a feeling of disappointment.Parsons sleepily performed the License to Depart, and the spirit was free toreturn to its home. In his r ecord of the w orking Parsons wrote that the“tension and unease continued for four days” and that he didn’t know what to donext.Around this time , Jane W olfe wrote to Cr owley, “Last e vening, when Jackbrought me these various papers for me to post to y ou, I saw, for the firsttime, the small boy, or child. This is it that is bewildered, does not quite know when to tak e hold in this matter , or where, and is completely bowled over bythe ruthlessness of Smith—Smith, who has a master hand when it comes to dealingwith this boy.”Also around this time, Wilfr ed Smith described his o wn state to Crowley:Ill started, ill maintained, ill ter minated. The shrine is desolate of thedivine; has ever been; and I am completely empty; so much so, I do not know if Iwrite accurately about myself. In fact I don’t know anything at all. Havenothing; am nothing . . .The worst of it is, I have some years yet to go and the prospect of having tolive with myself is—I assur e you—not at all pleasant. For I can’t see but thatmy brain will continually flog me till I go to sleep once and for all. I haveill understood your dealings with me these many years, and I am no better informed at this moment.And Parsons wrote Crowley, “I have diligently followed the VIIIth Degreeinstructions as (a) creation of new orders of beings with consecrated talismanicimages . P ossible connectiv e r esult: incr ease in writing output [a reference to Freedom Is A Two-Edged Sword?]; (b) Invocation of Mother Goddess ,using Priest’ s call in [Gnostic] mass and silver cup as talisman [for thematerial basis?]; sometimes using suitable poetry such as V enus. P ossibleconnectiv e result: loss of Betty’s affections as pr eliminary to (c) Invocation of Air Elemental Kerub [Cherub] . . . in Enochian Air Tablet.” The“suitable poetry” is not r ecorded in his account of the w orking. The riteended with Parsons commanding the elemental to appear in human form.The “Kerub of the Air” of Air quadr ant is called ERZLA. There are four Kerubsfor each of the four Tablets, and 12 Lesser Kerubic Angels and 16 Lesser Angelsfor each as w ell, part of the complicated (but highly structured) system.The Priest’s Call in the Gnostic Mass is a short recitation in Greek that thePriest makes when the Priestess is behind the v eil. It apparently was apreliminary to the lengthy rites of the Babalon W orking (24 complete invocations in 12 da ys!) and is a call to the cr eative power of the Priest asrepresented by his “lance” (i.e., phallus). The call is:IO IO IO IAO SABAO KYRIE ABRASAX KYRIE MEITHRAS KYRIE PHALLE. IO PAN, IO PANPAN, IO ISCHYROCH, IO A THANATON, IO ABROTON , IO IAO. CHAIRE PHALLE CHAIRE P ANPHAGE CHAIRE PANGENETOR. AGIOS, AGIOS, AGIOS IAO, which is O, O, O, IAO, Sabao,Lord Abrasax, Lor d Mithras, Lor d Phallus. O Pan, O Pan Pan, O Str ong One, OImmor tal One, O Divine One, O IAO. Hail Phallus, Hail All-Devourer, HailAll-Begetter. Holy, Holy, Holy IAO.Iao, Sabao, and Abr asax ar e Gr eek deities with long histories: They are solarin nature, and the rising sun is the Phallus invoked in the call.Following the working, Parsons was at first despondent: “Nothing seems to havehappened. The windstorm is very interesting, but that is not what I ask ed for,”he wrote Crowley. On January 18, P arsons and Hubbard went into the MojaveDesert to relax. At sunset the feeling of tension suddenly left P arsons, and heturned to Hubbar d “in absolute certainty that the oper ation w as accomplished”and said simply, “It is done ,” echoing Jesus’ “It is finished” spok en on thecross.At this time, Grady McMurtry, whom Parsons met at a science fic-tion meeting, returned fr om England and mo ved to San F rancisco with the intent of starting alodge there. He spent the week of January 14th to the 2 0th at 1 003 S. Or angeGrove, interviewing the v arious members of the lodge to determine what w asgoing on and what could be done about it. Cr owley had sent him in to see ifther e was any w ay to fix the mess he had been hearing about. McMurtry’ sreport is dated January 25 and includes signed statements fr om Parsons andseveral others. Parsons was surprised to see McMurtry , who had left as aninferior in the Or der, return as his superior.McMurtry told Cr owley that Parsons was “. . . a man of integrity andaspiration, all he lacks is an e xperienced instructor. He is easily theoutstanding personality of the whole gr oup.” He also mentioned a new femaleinterest of Parsons’ named Helen Parker, but apparently nothing of notedeveloped between the two.McMurtry’s report found the lodge in a messas many of the members were bickeringabout almost everything, yet he saw hope for the future. Parsons, he said, w as“shaking the debris of A gape from his shoulders and preparing to make a cleanstart with a more ambitious program than ever. A lesser man would have washedhis hands of the whole affair.”McMurtry further outlined a pr ogram of adv ertising, initiation, training, andperformance of the Gnostic Mass as the immediate needs of the lodge . Parsonswanted to incorpor ate the OTO, which McMurtry endorsed. Parsons would stay inPasadena with the Agape Lodge, while McMurtry would return to San F rancisco andopen the Thelema Lodge. This plan did not materialize until 1977, long afterParsons’ death.Parsons w anted to pur sue the adv ertising campaign as a “Synagogue of Satan”;McMurtry thought this angle w as fine for some but not all-inclusive. He wantedto pursue a less sensationalistic campaign in San F rancisco, modeled after theAbbe y of Thelema in Cefalu, Sicily.McMurtry closes b y referring to A gape Lodge as “Hodge P odge Lodge,” which hesa ys the r esidents of 1 003 S. Or ange Grove call “Ghastly Gables .” Neithertitle is flattering. P arsons’ attached statement says that he sold the big hometo finance an e xplosives manufacturing plant, such that he e vidently didn’t own the house v ery long. Another member, Max Schneider, with whom Parsons seemsto have been bickering the most, said Parsons was trying to “combine a Lodge, apr ofess house, and a r ooming house for thrill seek ers all under one roof.”The other statements speak well of Parsons, but say that the influence of Smithwas still too strong.One interesting remark was made b y Roy Leffingw ell, who told McMurtry that Parsons w as “impr egnating statuettes with a vital force by invocation, and thenselling the statuettes .” He further said that Parsons reminded him “of the young Crowley—he is so set on overturning the present system that he will stop atnothing.” No mention is made of the Babalon Working in any of McMurtry’sreports.Parsons’ disappointment at the r esults of the w orking had been alleviated bythe ne xt month, when, on F ebruary 23, 1946, he triumphantly wrote to Cr owley,“I ha ve my elemental! She turned up one night after the conclusion of the Operation, and has been with me since, although she goes back to Ne w York nextweek. She has red hair and slant gr een eyes as specified. She is an artist, strongminded and determined, with strong masculine characteristics and a fanaticalindependence. If she returns she will be dedicated as I am dedicated!”The elemental w as Marjorie Elizabeth Camer on, sprung fr om Parsons’ head lik eSophia from the Godhead or P allas A thena from Zeus. She actually arriv ed atthe lodge befor e Parsons left for the desert with Hubbar d. McMurtry had justleft, and the Babalon Working w as still in pr ogress (but w as not kno wn toCamer on). Cameron came back tw o weeks later after some friends of P arsonstracked her do wn at the emplo yment office. This time she came to stay.Parsons described Cameron as an “air of fire type with bronze red hair, fieryand subtle, determined and obstinate, sincere and perverse, with e xtraordinaryper sonality, talent, and intelligence .” She remained in the dark about theBabalon W orking until long after it was finished—even though she w as toparticipate in its ne xt phase. Parsons made her a pr otective talisman, whichshe w ore around her neck for years until police took it a way because it had apotent poison sealed inside.Parsons exultantly wrote in his notes that Camer on answered all therequirements of the elemental he had inv oked. She adopted the magical name“Candida” (the Latin root of “candid”), calling herself “Candy” for short. He wrote that she “demonstr ated the natur e of woman to y ou [referring to himself]in such unequiv ocal terms that you [Parsons] should have no further r oom forillusion on the subject.” Parsons and Cameron would marry in October of thatyear, just eight months later. Shortly after they met, the ever-romantic Parsonscomposed a poem for her, “Witch Woman,” which opens his poetry collection Songsfor the Witch Woman:I hear your voice low in the duskLike the notes of the harp playerThat carve the still airInto a sensuous and subtle imager y of sound. And my senses are drownedBy the scent of the oleander and the muskOf the datura dimly shining in the dark,While your voice troubles the still air,And I recallAn ancient garden and a secret callAnd your slant eyes and your red hairEngender dreams of days beyond despair. And under your sorcery I fare forthTo fabulous lands and meadows green with SpringAnd caught on the gossamer web of eveningI behold incredible things no poet ever told.Marjorie Cameron was born on April 23, 1922 in Belle Plain, Iowa, which islocated in Benton County in east centr al Iowa. Her parents were Hill LislieCamer on, originally fr om Illinois , and Carrie V . Ridenour, a nativ e of Iowa. Camer on actually gr ew up in northern Wisconsin, “ a country of fer ociousgr andeur.” When she met Parsons, she was 5′5”, 126 pounds, fair-complected withfreckles, red hair and blue (not green) eyes. An “air of fire type,” as Parsonscalled her, is typically a Leo in the Enochian s ystem (on the Fir e Tabletrather than the Air T ablet), and is associated with the Prince of Wands in theTarot.Cameron had served in the WAVES during WWII, at which time she had beenstationed in W ashington, D.C. She had also serv ed as an aide to the JointChiefs of Staff ther e, after entering the Na vy as an Apprentice Seaman onDecember 9, 1942 at Chicago, Illinois . She was honorably discharged fromWashington, D.C. as a photographer on November 16, 1945, after which she movedto Los Angeles, where one of her Na vy friends took her to the A gape Lodge.Interestingly, Cameron, Hubbard and Heinlein were all in the Navy. A Freedom ofInformation Act request revealed that the FBI had no file on her.From January 19 (the very day Cameron arrived!) to February 27, Parsons dailyrecorded that he “inv oked the Goddess BABALON with the aid of m y magicalpartner, as was proper to one of m y grade.” The magical partner was, of course,Cameron, though some writers have tried to make it Hubbard, who was in actualitynot present. The grade Parsons referred to is the IX° of the OTO, a rite involving sexual intercourse in much the w ay that the VIII° involves masturbation.However, Parsons evidently never held this grade, nor was this a IX° working,based on the w ay Crowley ran the higher gr ades in the 1940s. At that time,Agape Lodge was the only oper ating lodge of the OTO. Members there couldrequest the grade, as it w ere, and Crowley w ould confirm their right to w orkit despite the fact that they had not attained the intermediate grades. However,just because a few members were working with the IX° material does not mean theycould demonstr ate attainment, as ther e w ere no other legitimate IX° memberspresent to guide them and confirm their r esults. The Babalon Working inparticular was far too unorthodox to have been a part of this degr ee; it wasspecially designed by Parsons for this one purpose.According to Camer on, the rite consisted of her and P arsons spending two weeksin bed. Unfortunately, Parsons did not record the details of his daily invocations, or if he did the y have not survived. Cameron said the two talkedincessantly: “He educated me . . . that’s what he w as supposed to do.” She alsor elated that he made her aware she “had a mission in the world.” Of course, shewas ignorant of the entire Babalon Working, of which she was supposed to be theelemental invoked, until well past its completion.On F ebruary 27, Camer on w ent back to Ne w York to visit her boyfriend, aphotogr apher named Napoleon, spending tw o w eeks there, during which time shedumped him. She later said she returned to Pasadena when she disco vered she waspregnant by Parsons. The day after she left for New York, Parsons returned tothe Mojave Desert without Hubbard, who had gone a way for awhile, perhaps to theVA hospital in San Francisco. Parsons invoked Babalon in the desert, presumablythrough a solo sexual rite of some sort, though he does not say. What r esultedwas phenomenal: “The pr esence of the Goddess came upon me ,” he wr ote, “and Iw as commanded to write the following communication.”The communication Parsons was commanded to write w as Liber 49, often mistakenlyreferred to as The Book of Babalon , of which it is only a part. Liber 49 is toolong to reproduce here, but it has been reproduced widely in print and on theinternet in unauthorized v ersions. The communication falls w ell outside theorthodo xy of the OTO’s system, their test of its genuineness and spiritualcoher ence being its claim to be the fourth chapter of Liber AL—which isdescribed internally as “threefold.” 28[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-28]Parsons took Liber 49 to be an affirmation of the need to pr oduce a “magicalchild.” Liber 49 has 77 verses: The se ven-pointed star is sacred to Babalon(which has seven letters), and 7 × 7 = 49, a number also sacred to Babalon.Besides being two sevens side-by-side, 77 is 7 × 11, and 11, as we have alreadyseen, is the number of Crowley’s magick.Parsons came to see Liber 49 as the fourth chapter of The Book of the Law.Parsons saw the four chapters as corresponding to the four letters of theineffable name of God: YHWH, the Hebrew Yod Hé Vau Hé. He assigned one chapterto each letter and to what each letter represented: F ather, Mother , Son,Daughter , or God, Holy Ghost, Christ, and the gnostic Sophia, the Puer, Vir,Puella, Mulier of Liber 36.Of the 77 original v erses of Liber 49, 73 survive. Liber 49 begins:1. Yea, it is I, BABALON.2. And this is my book, that is the four th chapter of the Book of the Law , Hécompleting the Name, for I am out of NUIT by HORUS, the incestuous sister ofRA-HOOR-KHUIT.Five of the surviving verses mention fire, flame or burning, which seemsappropriate for a man w orking with r ockets and e xplosives. Three mention the“Black Pilgrimage ,” which w e will also discuss later. Two mention the number 11, albeit one incorr ectly: Verse 65 calls it the number of a witches’ co ven,but that number is 13. References to Cr owley’s w ork, especially The Book ofthe Law , abound, and those familiar with that w ork will find this one eas yenough to interpret.Verses 28 and 29 r efer to Cr owley’s Liber Astarte, with the statement that thew orking is of “nine moons .” Liber A starte vel Berylli sub figura CLXXV is“The Book of Uniting Himself to a Particular Deity by Devotion” and is reproduced in Cr owley’s Magick, but not in Magick in Theory and Pr actice. Thedeity in P arsons’ case w as Babalon. There is no timefr ame specified in thebook, but Babalon’ s purported message to Parsons regarding a nine-month workingseems excessive, and there is certainly no surviving record to bear this out.Parsons may have interpreted this nine-month figure to mean that the working inthis case involved a magical birth rather than a literal one.Verse 48 reads, “Now is the hour of birth at hand. No w shall m y adept becrucified in the Basilisk abode ,” a r eference to Cr owley’s Magus initiationfrom 1916. One of the entries in Cr owley’s magical record for the period reads, “He hath crucified a toad in his basilisk abode,” reflecting the time Crowley christened a frog “Jesus,” crucified it, then ate its legs and burned ther est. This incident w as a ritual affirmation of the super session of what Crowley called “the slave-gods.”The “basilisk abode” refers to the womb, as tradition held that the basilisk, or“legendary reptile with fatal breath and glance,” was born of menstrual blood.In Greek, basileos means “king,” and the frog is a symbol of transition, livingas it does in two worlds (water and dry land).Two chapters survive of P arsons’ original The Book of Babalon . One, “The Starof Babalon,” is in Freedom Is A Two-Edged Sword. It consists of dir ections fromBabalon to the e xpected Magical Child, and is not to be confused with P arsons’r ecord of the Babalon Working. The other chapter consists of quotes from asecret OTO document of the VIII°."},{"pageContent":"eightThe Babalon Working, Part 2: March 1946In March 1946, the r ed-haired elemental Camer on r eturned fr om Ne w Y ork andmo ved in with Parsons. She w as to be an integr al part of the Babalon Working, though did not kno w it at the time . She did feel lik e she w as in themiddle of something, so much so that she felt as if she w ere “sp ying.” Parsonswrote that he kne w not in whom Babalon w as incarnate, but Cameron said he hadbeen w arned in the desert not to tell her it w as she . To prove herself tohim, Camer on would provide a sign, which she claimed w as her sighting of asilv er, cigar-shaped UFO. This incident was the only time the two everdiscussed UFOs, she said. She actually derided his magick at the time, but laterproved to herself that it worked.On March 1, P arsons again pr epared the altar and the v arious magical weapons,this time “in accor dance with the instructions in Liber 49.” What changed? Inverses 18 through 22, Babalon specifies sandalwood incense, a gr een and goldcloth to co ver the altar, her book (Liber 49) and the other magical implements, including a three-inch copper disk with the sevenfold Star of Babalon paintedin gold on a blue back ground, which w as to be the ne w talisman, replacing theparchment talisman of the original Enochian rite . The talisman was to beanointed in much the same w ay, although this time with the se xual secr etionsof both partner s—Parsons and Cameron.The operation began as directed on March 2, when Hubbard, who had been awaysince the 27th or 28th of F ebruary, returned with a description of “a vision hehad that e vening of a savage and beautiful woman riding naked on a greatcat-like beast,” Parsons wrote. “He [Hubbard] w as impr essed with the ur gentnecessity of giving me [Parsons] some message or communication. W e preparedmagically for this communication, constructing a temple at the altar with theanalysis of the key word [INRI]. He was robed in white, carrying the lamp, and Iin black, hooded, with the cup and dagger [tw o of the magical weapons]. At hissuggestion w e played Rachmaninoff’s ‘Isle of the Dead’ as background music, andset an automatic r ecorder to transcribe an y audible occurr ences. A t approximately 8 p.m. he began to dictate, I transcribing directly as I received.” 29[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-29]After Parsons’ initial contact with the astral plane during this second working,Hubbar d began acting as seer , although Parsons continued to call him “Scribe”in his notes , and it was actually he who was “scrying in the A ethyr” while Parsons took notes . In r egard to Hubbard’s vision of the catlike beast andnaked woman, it should be recalled that Crowley repeatedly referred to the Beastand his Scarlet Woman in the Book of Revelation, which Crowley identified ashimself and his curr ent consort, corr esponding also to the Gnostic-Christianher esiarch Simon Magus and his Helen. The w oman was Sophia incarnate, andHubbar d’s vision was once again seen as the cover picture for the fir stedition of Williamson’ s Darker Than Y ou Think (from 1948).It is uncertain whether or not the tape recording of the March 1946 sessionstill e xists, but the incr edible transcript has surviv ed, ho wever, quotedhere verbatim, since a summary would not do it justice.

Discuss nothing of this matter until thou ar t certain that thine understanding embraces all.Upon the completion of Babalon’ s message, Parsons immediately set aboutfollowing the instructions dictated by her, as well as those received the nightbefore (March 1), although he did not record what those instructions were.As a part of this March 2 ceremony, he recited passages from several key worksof Crowley’s and elsewhere, passages that are vital to understanding the rite:1. The Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram.2. Excerpt from the Gnostic Mass.3. Excerpt from Crowley’s The Vision and the Voice.4. A short verse dedicated to Babalon.5. The Key Call of the Seventh Air e.6. Excerpt from Crowley’s Tannhäuser.Parsons opened with an esoteric analy sis of what he called “the key w ord,”INRI, which is a part of the “Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram” he actuallyperformed, though he did not r ecord the fact by name and only wrote “analysisof the key word.” He probably also performed the other rituals of the He xagramand Pentagram, but he does not say.Parsons recorded the analy sis of the k ey word as follo ws: “The temple isopened with the analy sis of the k ey word: INRI. Yod Nun Resh Yod. Virgo IsisMighty Mother. Scorpio Apophis Destr oyer. Sol, Osiris slain and risen. IAO. Thesign of Osiris slain (giv en). The sign of the mourning of Isis (giv en). Thesign of Apophis and T yphon (given). L.V. X., Lux, the Light of the Cr oss.”During the ritual, the magician must adopt at each stage of the analysis certainpostures. Crossed arms, for example, represent Osiris slain, as the posture acorpse takes during burial. The entire ritual is recorded by Crowley in Magickand elsewhere. The gods invoked are Egyptian gods.INRI is not a word but an acronym, representing the initials of the messagePontius Pilate had nailed upon the cross in the gospel story: Iesus NazaraeusRex Iudaeorum, Latin for “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.” The acronym isoften seen depicted in paintings of the crucifixion, possibly arising as apainter’ s e xpedient. Medieval clerics manipulated the letters to finddifferent phrases that described Jesus while conforming to the same acronym.Mystics and alchemists found other, less orthodox interpretations as well. InMorals and Dogma, Albert Pike gives a few possible meanings of INRI, withholdingthe one which he sa ys Masons learn when they attain the 18th degr ee ofScottish Rite F reemasonry, known as Knight Rose Croix (Rose Cross). Themeanings Pik es does give are: Igne Natura Renovatur Integr a (All of Natur e isR enewed b y Fire); Igne Nitrum Roris Invenitur (The Cleanser of Fire Comes LikeDew); and the Jesuits’ alleged Iustum Necare Reges Impius (To Judge not but theImpiety of Royalty).35 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-35]In the Golden Da wn the analy sis of INRI was part of the 5° = 6 material. Crowley records a few of the interpr etations in his Sepher Sephiroth (“Book ofBooks”): Igni Natura Renovata Regnum (Birth by Fire R enews the Kingdom), IntraNobis R egnum deI (Within the Noble is the Kingdom of God), and e ven Isis Naturae R egina Ineffabilis (Isis, the Ineffable Queen of Natur e). This last interpretation may be the one Pike chose to withhold; it also hearkens back to John Deeand Queen Elizabeth.In the gospel tale , the original message w as posted in thr ee languages:Latin, Ar amaic (Hebrew), and koine Greek. Yod Nun R esh Yod are the Hebrewnames for the letters INRI. They are also words in the Hebrew tongue:hand-fish-head-hand, respectively. Each of these has further esoteric meaningsthat could be e xpanded indefinitely. The hand, for instance, represents thecreative force, as it is with our hands that we build tools, heal the sick,express our love. Yod is also Hebrew slang for “penis ,” another sort of creative power. Nun, the fish, is Scorpio, hence death. Resh is the back of thehead, and looks like a lar ge yod; for this r eason Crowley associated it withthe kundalini , the mysterious energy source in yoga that runs along the spineand out the top of the head. A whole treatise could be written on the analysisof INRI; the same could be said of TARO, which Babalon mentioned on March 2.The analysis complete, the invoking hexagrams are drawn in the air in the fourcar dinal directions (representing the four elements), and the name ARARITA“vibrated” in each quarter . When one “vibrates” a name, it is not merely spokenbut visualized as written, originating within the magician and going outw arduntil it fills the entire universe. ARARITA is also mentioned in theStar-Sapphire ritual from The Book of Lies and is a Hebrew acronym for one ofthe names of God.The second part of Parsons’ invocation is from the Gnostic Mass, recited as thePriest steps onto the fir st step leading to the altar, and as the Priestessdisr obes behind the v eil. Parsons recited the part of the Priest, and Camer on(representing Babalon) r ecited the part of the Priestess:THE PRIEST: “O cir cle of Stars [the Milky W ay] whereof our Father [the sun] isbut the younger br other, marvel beyond imagination, soul of infinite space,befor e whom T ime is ashamed, the mind bewildered, and the understanding dark,not unto Thee may we attain, unless Thine image be Love. Ther efore by seed andr oot and stem and bud and leaf and flower and fruit do we invoke thee.”[Parsons deleted the second par t of this invocation, which is a quote of ALI:27]. THE PRIESTESS [here Parsons actually wr ote “BABALON”]: “But to love me isbetter than all things; if under the night-stars in the desert thou presentlyburnest mine incense befor e me, invoking me with a pur e heart and the Serpentflame [kundalini] ther ein, thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom. For onekiss wilt thou then be willing to give all. But whoso gives one par ticle ofdust shall lose all in that hour . Ye shall gather goods and stor e of women andspices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations of earth insplendour and pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall ye come to myjoy . I char ge you ear nestly to come before me in a single r obe, and cover edwith a rich head dress. I love you! I year n to you! Pale or purple, veiled orvoluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the innermostsense, desir e you. Put on the wings, and ar ouse the coiled splendour[kundalini] within you: come unto me! T o me! To me! Sing the raptur ouslove-song unto me! Bur n to me per fume! Drink to me, for I love you! I loveyou! I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset, I am the naked brilliance of thevoluptuous night sky. To me! To me!”This priestess’s recitation is an expansion of AL I:61.The third part of the invocation comes from Crowley’s The Vision and the Voiceand was part of his w orking of the 12th Air e in 1909, spoken to Crowley by acelestial “charioteer”:Glory unto the Scarlet W oman, BABALON 36[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-36] the Mother of Abominations, thatrideth upon the Beast, for She hath spilt their blood in every corner of the earth, and lo! She hath mingled it in the cup of Her whoredom.With the breath of Her kisses hath she fermented it, and it hath become the wineof the Sacrament; the wine of the Sabbath; and in the Holy Assembly hath Shepour ed it out for Her worshippers; and they have become dr unken thereon, sothat face to face they beheld my Father. Thus ar e they made wor thy to par takeof the Mystery of this holy vessel, for the blood is the life.Beautiful art thou O BABALON, and desirable, for thou hast given Thyself to everything that liveth, and thy weakness hath subdued their strength. For in thatunion Thou didst understand. Therefore art Thou called Understanding, O BABALON,Lady of the Night!O my God, in one last rapture let me attain to the union with the many. For Sheis Love, and Her Love is one, and She has divided the one love into infiniteloves, and each love is one, and equal with the One, and therefore is She passedfrom the Assembly and the Law and the enlightenment into the anar chy ofsolitude and darkness. For ever thus must She veil the brilliance of Herself.Parsons actually abbr eviated this passage , as he did with the excerpt from theGnostic Mass , and did not r ecite it v erbatim. It is longer in the original.The fourth inv ocation was, “ O BABALON, BABALON beloved, come now, partake ofthe sacrament, possess this shrine. Take me now! Let me be drunken on the wineof your fornications; let your kisses wanton me to death. Accept thou thissacrifice willingly given!” This passage seems to ha ve been an original v erseby Parsons, not found anywhere in the works of Crowley.The fifth inv ocation was written as the K ey Call of the Se venth Aire, but thetext Parsons recorded is actually the Se venth Call, e vidently the same type ofshift P arsons made when he wr ote that he used the “K ey Call of the Thir dAire” but actually utilized the Thir d Call. The Seventh Call in English is:The East is a house of Virgins singing praises among the flames of first glory[the rising sun] wherein the Lord hath opened his mouth; and they are become 28living dwellings [the phases of the moon, hence days] in whom the str ength ofman r ejoiceth; and they ar e apparelled with ornaments of brightness, such aswork wonders on all creatures. Whose kingdoms and continuance ar e as the Thir dand Fourth [Aires], strong towers and places of comfort, the Seats of Mercy andContinuance. O ye Servants of Mercy, Move! Appear! Sing praises unto theCreator; and be mighty amongst us. For that to this r emembrance is given power, and our str ength waxeth strong in our Comforter!The following is the original Enochian, in Roman letters. Although the words arethe same , Parsons’ spellings v ary considerably from those recorded by Crowley.Ra-asa isalamanu para-di-zoda oe-cari-mi aao iala-pire-gahe Qui-inu. Enaibutamonu od inoasa ni pa-ra-diala. Casar emeji ujeare cahirelanu, od zodonacelucifatianu, car esa ta vavale-zodir enu tol-hami. Soba lonudohe od nuame cahisata Da o Desa vo-ma-dea od pibeliare itahila rita od miame ca-ni-quola rita!Zodocar e! Zodameranu! Iecarimi Quo-a-dahe od I-mica-ol-zododa aaiome. Bajirelepapenor e idalugama elonusahi—od umapelifa vau-ge-ji Bijil—IAD!”The original ends with “IAD,” which means “God” (Crowley translated it “comforter,” which usually r efers to the Holy Spirit). In Parsons’ notes he hasreplaced “IAD” with “BABALON.”The sixth invocation was from Crowley’s play Tannhäuser, alternating v ersesoriginating with the w orshiper and his goddess . A Wagnerian opera, Tannhäuserwas based on a 13th-century German epic poem. The main character, Tannhäuser,was a mortal who spent some time as the goddess V enus’ lo ver but e ventuallyleft her to return to earth and the sweetheart of his youth. Tannhäuserinadvertently reveals his try st with Venus, a disclosur e that means certaindeath. His mortal love, Elisabeth, pleads for his life, and he is spared butbanished as punishment for his deed. Alone, he longs for Venus. She hear s him,and is about to r eturn him to her when Elisabeth intervenes once again. Tannhäuser is r edeemed, and is escorted b y angels to paradise.Here again, P arsons and Camer on pr obably took turns r eciting theirrespective lines. Parsons played the part of T annhäuser, while Cameron wasVenus. Parsons began the romantic interlude:Isis art thou, and from thy life are fedAll showers and suns, all moons that wax and wane,All stars and streams, the living and the dead,The mystery of pleasure and of painThou art the mother, thou the speaking seaThou art the earth, and its fertility,Life, death, love, hatred, light, darkness return to theeTo Thee! Hathoor am I, and to my beauty drawnAll glories of the Universe bow down,The blossom and the mountain and the dawnFruits blush, and women, our creations crownI am the priest[ess], the sacrifice, the shrineI the love and life of the divineLife, death, love, hatred, light, darkness are surely mine, Are Mine! Venus art thou, the love and light of ear th,The wealth of kisses, the delight of tearsThe barren pleasures never came to birth,The endless infinite delight of years.Thou art the shrine at which my long desireDevoured me with intolerable fire.Thou wert song, music, passion, death upon my lyr e—My lyre. I am the Grail and I the glor y now;I am the flame and fuel of thy br eastI am the star of God upon thy br ow;I am the queen, enraptured and possessed,Hide thee sweet river, welcome to thee, seaOcean of love that shall encompass theeLife, death, love, hatred, light, darkness return to me—To me!After the completed invocation, which was more like a bard’s love poem, Parsonsburned the Enochian Air T ablet he had used in the January stage of this working. He then smashed a small statue of Pan, which had been a fa voritepossession. He r ecorded that at the same instant the r oof on his guest housecaught fir e and w as damaged, apparently attributing this destruction tosupernatur al forces, although the burning parchment may have had something todo with it as well.Regarding such sacrifices as the smashed statue , Crowley’s Liber Astarte, verse37, reads:Having made by thine Ingenium a talisman or pantacle to represent the particularDeity, and consecrated it with infinite love and car e, do thou burn itceremonially before the shrine, as if thereby giving up the shadow for thesubstance. But it is useless to do this unless thou do really in thine hear tvalue the talisman beyond all else that thou hast.Crowley noted in his Confessions, “I have noticed that every time I receive animportant initiation, some cherished article mysteriously disappears. It may bea pipe, a pen or what not: but it is alw ays an object which is impregnated withmy personality by constant use or special veneration. I cannot r emember asingle occasion when this has not happened. The theory is that the elementals orfamiliar spirits in attendance on the Magician e xact, so to speak, a tip on allimportant occasions of r ejoicing.” In such magical w orkings, e vidently, if you don’t offer something to the spirits , they will tak e it anyway.At 11:30 p.m. that same night, P arsons prepared three questions as dir ected,and at midnight he ask ed them of Babalon (and w as answered through Hubbard).How can I communicate dir ectly with BABALON, hear her , see her, feel her, besure that I am working aright?At the altar in meditation, as you know how. Also, invoke me carnally with allyour passion. Thus will you feel my desir e and increase my substance.How can I ser ve best?Follow instructions exactly and in detail. A void loose inter ruptions. Bediligent. Do not hesitate or question, act. All depends on your time.How can I be certain of the vehicle [of incar nation]?Do not trouble yourself with this. It does not concer n you. I will provide thevehicle, I will show you a sign, and signs. It is the now which concerns us.Keep your faith, think not over much.While meditating the following morning, Parsons was interrupted by one of histenants , whom he then cur sed “in the Anglo-Sax on fashion.” The man becameill, and Parsons realized he had erred. He apologized to him, but the da ycontinued badly. That night Babalon purportedly continued her message, but thespeaker, curiously, seems to be another (all parenthetical remarks are copiedfrom the original):In the presence of our Lord PAN, at the feet of Our Lady BABALON, at the feet ofHer (servants?) (changing?) we declare unto thee this message (consecrated,dedicated, never to be defiled?) (the Scribe was uncertain here) containing therituals of the second and thir d days, of the welcome and pr eparation in theName of Our Lady of the N ight most gracious, to pur e lewd and whor esome LadyBABALON. Oh thou who ar t mortal tremble; given it is unto thee a feat neverbefore performed in the annals of your histories, never before accomplishedsuccessfully . Many have dar ed, none succeeded.Our Lady BABALON must descend to triumph.Mortality. We have not asked this of another, nor shall we ever. Even now wedoubt thy faith. Is this accepted, are you willing to proceed. Answer aloud.I am willing.Then know thou ar t alr eady faulty in thy deliver y. These ar e extraneousthings. The elemental was not pr operly released (this was corrected), thou wertguilty of human rage, the current of force has been disturbed. Bewar e, shouldstthou falter again, we will sure slay thee.But insofar as thy working was consecrated it has succeeded. Rectify thy mor talfault and er ror. Consecrate all. Now r eceive the second and third rituals.Consecrate thyself as instructor of Our Lady Incarnate.Take the black box, concentrate upon its emptiness for one hour, gaze into it,and thou wilt see, imprinted upon it, a shape, a sign, a sacred design, whichshall be the sign delivered by Our Lady Babalon Incarnate. When thou hastfinished, when thou hast r ecognized this pattern, construct it in wood. 37[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-37]This is the sigil.Ten be the hour appointed. Invoke long, to music indicated. 38[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-38]When thou canst feel Our Lady incar nate in thy being, take the black box andper form the consecrated rite. W ear thou scarlet, symbolic of birth. Be sashedin black. It matters not the quality of goods. Take then the box, make then thesign.Paint upon it a second sign which thou knowest. If thou hast forgotten, gazeinto thy crystal.Meditate while gazing on the qualities of an instr uctor. Thou inscribe in Herbook, for Her guidance.Thou art forbidden to leave thy room.The end of the second ritual.At this point, Hubbard rested a while, then they continued.Begin four hours prior to dawn.A period of eradication of all inimical influences. Complete perfection. Wearblack. Cut fr om thy breast the red star. Renew the blood. Lay out a whitesheet. Place upon it blood of bir th39[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-39], since She is born of thy flesh, andby thy mor tal power upon earth.Thou shalt r ecognize by the sign. BABALON is born! It is new birth, all thingsar e changed, the signs, the symbols, the ever ything!Thou shalt compose with the aid of the muse suitable invocation of the bir th ofBABALON, and this thou shalt deliver to the flames which now burn too.This last instruction certainly refers to Parsons’ poem, “The Birth of Babalon,”which, fortunately for us, survived the flames. The mystical yet racy messagecontinued:Now thou shalt flame the third, chanting the invocation. She is born in thethird flame.In verse, seven verses of seven lines, seven magick wor ds. Stand and chantseven times. Envision thyself as a cloaked radiance desirable to the Goddess,beloved. Envision Her approaching thee. Embrace Her, cover Her with kisses.Think upon the lewd lascivious things thou couldst do. All is good to BABALON.ALL.Then rest, meditating on this:Thou as a man and as a god hast str ewn about the ear th and in the heavens manyloves; these r ecall, concentrate, consecrate each woman thou hast raped.Remember her think upon her, move her into BABALON, bring her into BABALON,each, one by one until the flame of lust is high.Then compose a verse of undeter mined lines on this, to BABALON. This verseshall be used in worship when she appears . 40[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-40]Then meditate upon thy desir e, think upon Her , and, touching naught, chantthese verses. Recall each lascivious moment, each lustful day, all set them intothe astral body, touching naught.The part about “ consecrating each w oman thou hast r aped” is likely not meantliter ally, and the instruction to “touch naught” e vidently r efers to atantric pr actice, as does the entir e instruction, essentially. It resumes:Preserve the material basis . 41 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-41]In the box?Yes.The lust is hers, the passion yours. Consider thou the Beast raping.Leave thy casual loves—all belongs to BABALON, thy lust is BABALON’s. She iswith thee thr ee days. The sign is hers, secr et, and no man knows itscorrespondence. Guard!The instruction was followed by “a prophecy” of unknown length, which Parsonsdeliberately omitted recording.Directly following the message , Parsons records instead a poem entitled “TheBirth of Babalon” that he wr ote as a means b y which to invoke Babalon. It isunclear at which point in these pr oceedings he used it, but it ma y have beenthe seventh part of the inv ocation, as a six-fold invocation makes little sensehere. Parsons also seems to have ignored the instructions to burn it, alreadynoted.A longish, well-composed poem, “The Birth of Babalon” begins:What is the tumult among the stars that have shone so still till now?What are the furrows of pain and wrath upon the immor tal brow?Why is the face of God turned grey and his angels all grown white?What is the terrible ruby star that burns down the crimson night?What is the beauty that flames so bright athwar t the awful dawn?She has taken flesh, she is come to judge the thrones ye rule upon.Quail ye kings for an end is come in the bir th of BABALON.Afterwards, Parsons expressed his confidence in the w orking, but wrote, “Now Ican do no mor e than pray and w ait.” On the sixth of March, Parsons recorded ina letter to Cr owley:I hardly know how to tell.I am under the command of extreme secrecy.I have had the most impor tant and devastating experience of my life betweenFebruary 2nd and March 4th.I believe it was the r esult of the 9th [degr ee] working with the girl[Cameron] who answered my elemental summons. (She is now in New York.)I have been in dir ect touch with One, who is most Holy and Beautiful, mentionedin The Book of the Law.I cannot write the name at present.First instructions were received direct, further through Ron acting as seer.I have followed them to the letter.There was a desire for incarnation.I was the agency chosen to assist the bir th, which is now accomplished.I do not yet know the vehicle, but it will come to me, bringing a secret sign Iknow.Forgetfulness was the price.I am to act as instructor, guardian, guide, for nine months.Then it will be loosed in the world.That is all I can say, now.There must be extreme secrecy.I cannot tell you the depth of r eality, the poignancy, terror and beauty I haveknown. Now I am back in the world, weak with r eaction.But the knowledge remains. I have found my will. It is to ser ve, and serve Ishall. All I am or will be is pledged.I must put the Lodge in Roy’s [Lef fingwell] hands, pr epare a suitable place,and car ry on my business to pr ovide the suitable material basis . . .It is not a question of keeping anything fr om you, it is a question of notdwelling or even thinking unduly on the matter until the time is right. Premature discussion or r evelation would cause an abortion.A manuscript is prepared, which will be r eleased to the proper persons at theright time . . .All the tests are right, all the signs are right. There is no danger, save inweakness or pride.Although he claimed there was no danger, in his metaphysical life, the fearlessParsons thus showed the same methodology he used in his rocket propulsion work,a tenaciousness in testing and a thrillseeker’s lack of caution concerning whathe ma y “conjure.” Secretly Parsons did write the name of the “One , who is mostHoly and Beautiful”: he called her Babalon. He further directed Crowley tocontact no one sa ve himself or Hubbar d r egarding this matter . Unfortunately,he does not seem to have tested this spirit with the rigorousness of his rocket-testing or thor oughness that Cr owley used when he w as contacted b yentities such as Abuldiz, Amalantr ah, Aiwass, and Lam. Cr owley always requiredproofs during such contacts, proofs established b y the gematria of certain k eywords, i.e ., the entity’s name, location, or some other word or phrase. IfParsons subjected “Babalon” to such a test, no r ecord survives.Again Parsons wrote, “For the last three days I have performed an operation ofbirth, using the air tablet, the cup, and a female figur e [Cameron?], properlyinvoked by the wand [penis], then sealed up in the altar. Last night I performedan oper ation of symbolic birth and delivery.” This operation is not part of theinstructions contained in Liber Astarte, which Liber 49 told him to enact, butit seems to have satisfied Parsons.On Mar ch 15, Cr owley sent P arsons an admonishment about Cameron: “I amparticularly interested in what y ou have written me about the elemental [Cameron], because for some little time past I have been endea vouring to interv eneper sonally on y our behalf. I would however have you recall [Eliphas] Levi’sadvice that ‘the love of the Magus for such things [elementals] is insensate andma y destroy him.’” “Eliphas Lévi” was the pseudonym of Alphonse-LouiseConstant, a “magic theor etician” who wrote two books, Dogma and Ritual of HighMagic and History of Magic , published in 1854 and 1856, respectively. Althoughhe died in 1875 in relative obscurity, his works gained popularity with F renchintellectuals such as Victor Hugo. Lévi’ s popularity stems fr om his ability tobe r omantic yet rational at the same time. Crowley was so impressed that heconsidered himself the reincarnation of Lévi. Crowley’s claim to have intervenedpersonally on Parsons’ behalf is interesting, as it certainly took place by useof the OTO’s “key,” i.e., magically.Crowley cautioned Parsons yet again about his own worst traits, in the letter ofMarch 15, 1946:It seems to me that there is a danger of your sensitiveness upsetting yourbalance. Any experience that comes your way you have a tendency toover-estimate. The first fine careless rapture wears off in month or so, andsome other experience comes along and carries you off on its back. Meanwhile youhave neglected and bewildered those who are dependent on you, either from aboveor from below.I will ask you to bear in mind that you have one fulcr um for all your levers,and that is your original oath to devote yourself to raising mankind. Allexperiences, all ef forts, must be referred to this; as long as it remainsunshaken you cannot go far wrong, for by its own stability it will bring youback fr om any tendency to excess.At the same time, you being as sensitive as you ar e, it behoves [sic] you to bemore on your guard than would be the case with the majority of people.As it had so many times before, the warning fell on deaf ears.The same da y, Parsons wrote Cr owley a letter, in which he formally turned theoperation of Agape Lodge over to R oy Leffingwell, so he could focus on his project. Parsons wrote that the “ IX ths”—meaning Leffingw ell, Jane W olfe, andhimself—w ould hold council monthly to discuss lodge policy. Whatever hadhappened to Parsons in the desert must ha ve been quite amazing for him to react so. He finally had dir ection, something he had lost when he sold out ofAerojet—something he ne ver really had spiritually , except perhaps when hefirst encountered Crowley and the OTO. A letter dated one day later was sent toall Agape Lodge members, declaring Leffingwell “executive head” of the lodge.Crowley was now a dying man with a heroin problem brought on by his ph ysician’streatment of his r espiratory problems. As further letters arriv ed fr om theStates , he became incr easingly unhapp y about Parsons’ claims, no doubtconcerned about the futur e of his life’s work.On April 19, Crowley wrote Parsons, “You have got me completely puzzled by yourremarks about the elemental—the danger of discussing or cop ying anything. Ithought I had a most morbid imagination, as good as any man’s, but it seems Ihave not. I cannot form the slightest idea what y ou can possibly mean.”And to K arl Germer, Crowley wrote, “Apparently he, or Hubbar d, or somebody, ispr oducing a Moonchild. I get fairly fr antic when I contemplate the idiocy ofthese goats.”42 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-42]The purpose of Parsons’ Babalon Working seems to ha ve been the birth of achild—the Moonchild—into whom Babalon would incarnate. It had said in The Bookof the Law four decades earlier that this child would be “mightier than all thekings of the Earth” (AL III:45). Aleister Crowley had once thought F rater Achad was this magical child, the birth of which occurs on the astral planerather than the physical and represents a possession of sorts . Jane W olfewrote that Jack P arsons might be this child, but Parsons himself thoughtdifferently.The fact that Cameron later claimed to have been impregnated by Parsons duringtheir first two weeks together casts doubt upon the literal application of theterm Moonchild. She said she had an (illegal) abortion with Parsons’ consent(and another abortion later on), then just a few days later they were performinganother working. If a literal child were what he was seeking (remember, shedidn’t know the purpose of the w orking), the purported pr egnancy probablywould have gone another w ay. This abortion story actually serv es as goodevidence that Parsons was looking for an adult female to arriv e, perhaps in amanner similar to Camer on’s arrival.In any case, the “magical child” is an ages-old concept found in the mythologies of certain cultur es. The magical child concept Parsons was pursuingwas given definition by Crowley, of course. In De Arte Magica Aleister Crowleywrote, “It is said by certain initiates that to obtain Spiritual gifts, and toaid Nature, the Sacrament should be as it were a Nuptial of the Folk of theEarth; but that Magick is of the Daemon, and that b y a certain perv ersion ofthe Office , may be created Elementals fit to perform the will of the Magician.”The “perversion,” no doubt, refers to unorthodox acts of sex by which may becreated elementals or “magical” children.Also called a “homunculus” (“little man”), the Moonchild’ s cr eation isdescribed in Cr owley’s novel by the same name, Moonchild (originally titled TheButterfly Net):But other magicians sought to make this Homunculus in a way closer to nature. Inall these cases they had held that environment could be modified at will by theapplication of telesmata or sympathetic figures. For example, a nine-pointedstar would attract the influence which they called Luna—not meaning the actualmoon, but an idea similar to the poets’ idea of her . By sur rounding an objectwith such stars, with similarly-disposed herbs, per fumes, metals, talismans,and so on, and by carefully keeping off all other influences by parallelmethods, they hoped to invest the original object so treated with the Lunarqualities, and no others. (I am giving the briefest outline of an immensesubject.) Now then they proceeded to tr y to make the Homunculus on ver ycurious lines.Man, said they, is merely a fertilized ovum properly incubated. Heredity isthere even at first, of course, but in a feeble degr ee. Anyhow, they could arrange any desir ed envir onment fr om the beginning, if they could only manageto nourish the embr yo in some artificial way—incubate it, in fact, as is donewith chickens to-day. Furthermore, and this is the crucial point, they thoughtthat by per forming this experiment in a specially pr epared place, a placeprotected magically against all incompatible for ces, and by invoking into thatplace some one for ce which they desired, some tremendously power ful being,angel or ar changel—and they had conjurations which they thought capable ofdoing this—that they would be able to cause the incar nation of beings ofinfinite knowledge and power, who would be able to bring the whole world intoLight and Truth.I may conclude this little sketch by saying that the idea has been almostuniversal in one form or another; the wish has always been for a Messiah orSuper man, and the method some attempt to produce man by artificial or at leastabnormal means.Crowley speaks of a (female) magical child who would be the product of her environment rather than her her edity, a de velopment that distinguishes magicalchildr en fr om the r egular type. One r elatively recent attempt at producing amessianic child occurred with the occult society of Theosophy, whose leaders atthe time tried to raise the young Indian boy, Jiddhu Krishnamurti, as their o wnWorld Savior. The plan failed, as Krishnamurti e ventually abandoned theTheosophists and started his own movement, for which he became w orld-renowned.In Parsons’ case, however, he (and Crowley) seem to have been using the phrases“magical child” and “Moonchild” interchangeably—and not as literally asCrowley’s description would suggest.Although like Jones before him Parsons himself was viewed as the magical child,he e vidently felt otherwise , such that he w as determined himself to pr oduceit—or, rather, her—as Parsons wrote of a female messiah. Indeed, the purpose ofP arsons’ operation has been -underemphasized, as the Babalon W orking itself was a pr eparation for what w as to come: a thelemic messiah. This messiah w ouldmature in a magically influenced envir onment. She w ould then assume aleadership role. In addition, the word “child” was symbolic, intended not for aninfant but for one w oman in particular (or perhaps even all women in general).It seems clear that P arsons was seeking not an idea but a living being, whoevidently was not Cameron. “There was a desire to incarnate,” he wrote. Heconsidered Cameron his elemental, though he did occasionally (and paradoxically) refer to her Babalon—as she later did herself. But the Babalon Working was clearly aimed at bringing Babalon down to earth from somewhere else.This plan backfired.It was not nine months but nine y ears later that Camer on would claim to beBabalon herself and to have given birth to a magical child on the astr al plane.In the meantime , Parsons started to look elsewhere for this “ child”—to aphysical incarnation embodied in some unknown person. He wr ote, “The invocation of Babalon serv ed to exteriorize the Oedipus comple x; at the same time, because of the forces involved it pr oduced extraordinary magical effects .However, this operation is accomplished and closed—you [referring to himself]should have nothing mor e to do with it—nor e ven think of it, until Hermanifestation is r evealed, and pr oved beyond the shado w of a doubt.”With the Babalon Working, it may also be that Parsons was trying to competeagainst Smith for Crowley’s attention, even though Smith had been forced intoexile. Indeed, the Babalon Working has parallels with Crowley’s Liber 132, inwhich he exalted Smith in order to send him on a “retreat.”028 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_028_r1.gif]"},{"pageContent":"nineParsons’ Final Years: 1946-1952On February 20, 1946, in between the two parts of the Babalon W orking, Parsons,Hubbar d and Betty formed a compan y called “ Allied Enterprises .” T o Hubbard’s $1,183.91, Parsons put up $2 0,970.80, which w as his “laundr omat money,”while y oung Betty contributed nothing. In this enterprise , they w ere to buyboats on the East Coast and sail them back to California for r esale (or to wthem b y trailer, if cheaper). The y also stated an inter est in inv estments ofa “v aried and eclectic natur e,” from which it may be inferred that they wentbeyond boats—perhaps into explosives. Some of the mone y, Parsons said, as did Rypinski, was used to buy the house at 1 003 S. Or ange Grove Ave. as w ell,which Parsons leased first.In April 1946, after the second part of the Babalon W orking, Ron left withBetty and $1 0,000 of the compan y’s mone y. Later that month Parsons started tothink that they had cheated him. He threatened to chase them, but a call toHubbar d soon calmed him do wn. Astrologer and initiate Louis Culling o verheardthe call and couldn’t believe the formerly angry P arsons could be so easily swayed. Parsons ended the call with, “I hope w e shall alw ays be partner s, Ron,”a comment that made Culling cringe.Culling wrote to K arl Germer on Ma y 12, “As you may know by this time, BrotherJack signed a partnership agreement with this Ron and Betty wher eby all mone yearned b y the three for life is equally divided between the three. As far as Ican ascertain, Brother Jack has put in all of his money . . . meanwhile, Ron andBetty have bought a boat for themselves in Miami for about $10,000 and areliving the life of Riley, while Brother Jack is living at rock bottom, and Imean rock bottom. It appear s that originally the y ne ver secr etly intended tobring this boat ar ound to the California coast to sell at a pr ofit, as theytold Jack, but rather to have a good time on it on the east coast.” Indeed,Hubbard had written the Chief of Na val Personnel before he headed east, askingpermission to sail to South America and China.On May 22 Crowley wired to Germer, “Suspect Ron playing confidence trick—John Parsons w eak fool—obvious victim—pr owlingThanks for yours of May 23r d enclosing one from Frater Achad [Charles StansfeldJones]. It is ver y good that he should come crawling back to the penitent’sform after thirty years, but I do not quite see how it is going to make up forthe time he has wasted on his insane vanity, and you might let him know thisview.I am glad that his submission should have taken place at this moment, however,because his case ser ves as ver y useful to quote in discussing the business ofJack Parsons . . .The question of Frater 210 [Parsons] seems to me very typical. He reminds me upto a point—though he is on a much lower plane than they—of two men who joinedthe Or der shortly after I took it over [Jones and Victor Neubur g]: both casesseem to me to have certain significance if applied to the present position ofFrater 210.It seems to me on the infor mation of our Brethren in California (if we mayassume them to be accurate) Frater 210 has committed both these errors [i.e.,those of Jones and Neubur g].Both cases were alike in this—that after a ver y short period of training bothhad more than fulfilled their early promise; they could claim not onlyattainment, but achievement—and that in no small degree. I am sorry that thereis no possibility of making any similar claim on behalf of Frater 210 . . .He has got a miraculous illumination which rimes [sic] with nothing, and he hasappar ently lost all his personal independence. From our brother’s [LouisCulling] account he has given away both his girl and his money—appar ently it isthe or dinary confidence trick.Of course, I must suspend judgement until I have heard his side of the story,but he promised me quite a long while ago to write me a full explanation, and todate I have r eceived nothing from him . . .By June, a sadder but wiser P arsons could w ait no longer and went to Floridaafter Hubbar d and Betty , discovering they had purchased three boats. He foundtwo of the boats, but not Ron and Betty. One, the Harpoon, w as anchor ed at Howard Bond’ s Yacht Harbor. Another, Blue Water II, was at the American ShipBuilding Company. Parsons then r ented a r oom and w aited. Two days later,someone from Bond’s called Parsons to say that the Harpoon had just sailed. Hewas too late to catch them, so he r eturned to his room and consecrated acircle. Parsons wrote Crowley on July 5:Here I am in Miami, pursuing the childr en of my folly . . . Hubbar d attemptedto escape me by sailing at 5 PM, and I per formed a full invocation to Bartzabel [a form of Mars] within the Cir cle at 8 PM. At the same time, so far asI can check, his ship was str uck by a sudden squall off the coast, which rippedof f his sails and forced him back to port, where I took the boat in custody . .. I have them well tied up. They can not move without going to jail. However Iam afraid that most of the money has alr eady been dissipated. I will be luckyto salvage three to five thousand dollars. In the interim I have been flatbroke.Bartzabel had a little help from the U.S. Coast Guard, who rescued and detainedthe pair. Betty later described her and Hubbar d’s situation during the storm as“desperate,” relating that the two were very scared that they would not make itback to shore.On July 1, 1946, Parsons sued Allied Enterprises in Dade County, Florida Circuit Court, case number 1 01634. In an instance of remarkably swift justice ,the court appr oved a settlement on July 10, and on July 1 1 the three partnerssigned an agreement dissolving the compan y. Parsons recovered tw o boats: BlueW ater II (a schooner) and Diane (a yacht). Hubbard was allowed to retainpossession of the Harpoon, a tw o-masted schooner, and use it as collateralagainst a promissory note in the amount of $2900. Hubbar d was also or dered topa y Parsons’ legal fees . Parsons returned to Pasadena and ne ver hear d fromeither party again. Hubbar d and Betty eventually married and had a daughterHubbard’s career with Scientology is well-documented, in various versions,elsewhere.The incident affected not just Parsons, as his bad luck now forced him to stopsending money to his ex-wife, Helen, and Wilfred Smith, who had married. Thefact that he w as sending mone y to them in the first place reveals how much hethought of Smith, as well as his generosity. P arsons’ r egular contributions toCr owley, ho wever, would continue until the latter’ s death the next year. Atthe time of the financial disaster, Smith wrote to Crowley:It all seems to be folding up together. [Jack] can’t send any more money.Grimaud’s [Helen] is r unning out. These, and the fier ce stab of Regina’s[Kahl] death occurred all within a day or two. But above all I feel I have shotmy bolt, such as it was, and missed the mark.From the utterly desolate state in which I star ted out, which held for months,I am glad to say ver y recently the joy in some of the masterpieces has returnedto me. I expected never to write to you again; hardly know why I do. But thereis a feeling one owes a gentleman a letter when one fails to tur n up at adinner engagement. Besides, I don’t think I could get Grimaud to write you this;she refuses steadily to accept my negative view of this Grand MagicalRetirement. You must be so inur ed to disciples’ failur es that just one morewon’t surprise you.On August 20, Parsons sent a formal letter of resignation from the OTO to Crowley. Instead of the usual “Thrice Illuminated, Thrice Illustrious, and V eryDear Br other” salutation, he began it “Dear Aleister.” He gave no explanationbut merely said the resignation was his will, although it certainly may havebeen a reflection of his disillusionment in the face of such misfortunes. Heexpressed his continued sympathy to the Cr owley’s “Rights of Man” (Liber OZ),quoted below, but finished b y saying, “I do not belie ve that the OTO, as anautocratic organization, constitutes a true and proper medium for the expressionand attainment of these principles [the Rights of Man].” Many resigning membershave made similar remarks.Regarding P arsons’ sour ce of e xtra income , Louis Culling remarked thatParsons was “bootlegging nitroglycerine,” presumably meaning he w as selling itillegally . But to whom? Camer on apparently was bold enough to help him in thisenterprise , whatever it was. She and P arsons w ere married in San Juan Capistrano on October 19, 1946 by a Justice of the P eace named Mar co F. Forster, withEd Forman and his wife Jeanne witnessing the event. Recorded in the OrangeCounty Recorder’s Office, the marriage took place just before P arsons’ JPLpartner F rank Malina w as invited b y Julian Huxley to go to F rance and workfor UNESCO. Rypinski opined that Malina left the country to distance himself from the scandal r evolving around Parsons, as there apparently was aninvestigation into the house and possibly some ne wspaper exposure. But Malinahimself says he was just looking for something differ ent to do, which ringscloser to the truth.In late 1946, Parsons and Cameron left 1003 S. Orange Grove Ave., and the lodge,which met at several different places after this. The big house was later torndown to make way for apartments. Parsons also left his job with the V ulcanPowder Company, having been offer ed employment with the North American Aviation Corpor ation in nearby Ingle wood, California, wher e he w orked until1948, when Hughes Aircraft in Culver City hired him.In addition, Parsons engaged in consulting work. As such, he was often called onby the Los Angeles District A ttorney’s Office, the Los Angeles P oliceDepartment, the Los Angeles Superior Court, Northrup Air craft Compan y, General Chemical Compan y, the National Defense R esearch Council, and the Office ofScientific Research and De velopment. Parsons was also a member of se veraltechnical societies , including the American Chemical Society , the Institute ofA eronautical Sciences , the American Institute for the Advancement of Science ,the Society of Sigma Xi, and the Arm y Ordnance Association. His obituary saidhe had refused several honorary degrees, but there is no further evidence tosupport this claim. A membership in Sigma Xi seems unlikely due to his lack of adegree but is reported by two different sources, such that it is possible hisreputation was enough to gain him entr ance.Disillusioned b y the incident with Hubbar d and Betty , P arsons drifted a wayfr om magick and focused his will on his technical career, although the twoaspects of his life could never be completely separated. Unfortunately, hismisfortune continued, and he had little success, nothing to equal the glory ofhis W orld War II efforts . On May 17, 1948, his tw o worlds collided, as helost his go vernment security clearance “because of his membership in areligious cult . . . believed to adv ocate sexual perv ersion . . . or ganizedat subject’ s home . . . which had been r eported subv ersive.” Elsewhere theFBI describes it as a “mythic love cult,” despite Parsons’ insistence it was“dedicated to the fr eedom and liberty of the individual.” The same old plagueswere still haunting him.In a letter to Karl Germer dated June 19, 1949, Parsons said he lost theclearance for membership in the OTO and for publicly circulating Liber OZ, astatement of “the rights of man.” Kno wn also as Liber LXXVII, certain elementsof the statement are understandably disturbing to different factions of societyand, although P arsons may have viewed himself a teacher destined to affect thepo wers that be , the latter, accor ding him, e vidently per ceived him and hisideas as a security risk. Liber OZ reads in full as follows:The law of the strong: this is our law and the joy of the world.—AL II:2Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law .—AL I:40Thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay—AL I:42-3Every man and every woman is a star.—AL I:3There is no god but man.1. Man has the right to live by his own law—to live in the way that he wills to do:to work as he will:to play as he will:to rest as he will:to die when and how he will.2. Man has the right to eat what he will:to drink what he will:to dwell where he will:to move as he will upon the face of the ear th.3. Man has the right to think what he will:to speak what he will:to write what he will:to draw, paint, carve, etch, mould, build as he will:to dress as he will.4. Man has the right to love as he will:—Take your fill and will of love as ye will,when, where, and with whom ye will.—AL I:515. Man has the right to kill those who would thwar t these rights.The slaves shall ser ve.—AL II:58Love is the law, love under will.—AL I:57According to Parsons’ FBI file, however, the investigation was actually causedby his association with kno wn Communists , a pr oblem shared by his JPL/GALCITcomrades Frank Malina, Hsue-shen T sien and Martin Summerfield. As early as1938, the self-described anti-war, anti-capitalist P arsons had subscribed tothe Daily P eople’s World, a Communist paper, and had attended a fe w meetingsof different groups during the subsequent y ears, joining the “subv ersive”American Civil Liberties Union in 1946. One of the early victims of what wouldbecome the McCarthy witchhunts, Parsons later testified in closed court that hisinter est was merely an intellectual one . He told them that thelema, the “will”aspect of Crowley’s work, was definitely anti-communist and anti-fascist, whichit is, and his clearance was finally reinstated on March 7, 1949. Nonetheless ,Cameron left him soon after.Humorously, Parsons’ FBI file is full of r eferences to the “Chur ch of Thelma.”Ther e is also an unclear r eference to P arsons doing something on September 21, 1948 to bring the attention of go vernment officials upon him once mor e, butapparently nothing came of it. Parsons then spent tw o years on the staff of theUniv ersity of Southern California’s Pharmacology Department starting in 1948.Despite his occupational troubles based in part on his occult activities —orpossibly because of them—Parsons was unable to avoid the exotic lure. OnHalloween of 1948, Babalon called on Parsons in some unspecified manner and urged him to r esume his magick. Lik e so many who suffer the ills of the physical world, Parsons would turn once more to religion in his time of need,beginning a 17-day “working of the w and” (17 is a masculine number because ofits association with Mars), the climax of which was Babalon’s manifestation in adream. He had Smith christen him “Belarion Armiluss Al Dajjal, AntiChrist” as hetook the Oath of the Abyss. Oddly enough, considering the friction between them,Parsons remained close to Smith, the man who had married P arsons’ wife and whow as also his superior in the A∴A∴. Their relationship was probably more formalthan personal by this time.At the conclusion of his 17-da y w orking, Babalon instructed Parsons on an “astral w orking,” i.e ., an out-of-body e xperience. Parsons had, by his ownaccounts, a “well-developed body of light,” so apparently this travel was aneasy task for him. Indeed, he claimed success with a vision wherein he “wentinto the sunset with Her sign and into the night past accur sed and desolateplaces and c yclopean ruins, and so came at last to the City of Chor azin. Andthere a great tower of Black Basalt was raised, that was part of a castle whosefurther battlements ruled over the gulf of star s.”Chorazin was a small town on the Sea of Galilee that, according to the gospelstory , Jesus cur sed when the citizens w ould not r epent (Mt. 1 1:21; Lk. 10:13). Later legends claimed that the Antichrist would be born in Chor azin,whose modern name is K erazeh. The black basalt ruins of the city’s oldsynagogue to which Parsons refers are still standing.Regarding the title with which P arsons had himself christened b y Smith,Belarion is an alternate spelling (presumably from the Greek) of “Belial,” ademon named in the Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Jewish apocrypha (hiddentexts of dubious authenticity) whose name means “Without God,” as “Bel” or“Ba’al” means “God” or “Lor d.” Belarion is often identified b y Christianwriter s with the Beast in Revelation, with whom Aleister Cr owley in turnidentified himself. Rather than emulating his mentor , ho wever, P arsons ma yha ve acquired the moniker from a fantasy novel which featured a character bythat name.The term Armiluss is the Jewish equivalent of the Antichrist. As the end approaches, Je wish eschatology states , the Messiah ben Ephraim (“born of Ephr aim”or Isr ael, the northern kingdom) will come first, following by Armiluss whowill lead the armies of Gog and Magog against the armies of the Messiah at thebattle of Armageddon, murdering him. Ben Ephr aim’s corpse will be left for thescavengers, but the Messiah ben Da vid (whom the Christians believe was Jesus)will appear and resurrect him.The next word in Parsons’ title, Al-Dajjal, is the Islamic version of theAntichrist, whose name is Arabic for “the deceiver.” He does not appear in the Koran but rather in the hadith, which are the sayings of Mohammed as recorded byhis disciples. Al-Dajjal is blind in one eye but is able to perform mir acles,the gr eatest of which will be bringing order to a w orld in chaos . On JudgmentDa y he will be defeated by the Mahdi, whom most Muslims belie ve is the returnof Mohammed.The beastly-named P arsons then took the Oath of the Ab yss. “Crossing the Abyss” inv olves the total denial of the w orld and detachment from the ego. Theoath has survived along with some of Parsons’ other papers from this period andbegins as follo ws:I, who am called John Whiteside Parsons in the outer and Fra. 210 in the inner,do hereby in the presence of Fra. 132 [Wilfred Smith], take this oath of aMagister T empli [Master of the Temple], which for me is the Oath of Antichrist.And I swear that my name is BELARION ARMILUSS AL DAJJAL, ANTICHRIST who am cometo fulfil the law of the Beast 666 [Crowley].And I hereby accept all things needful for the fulfillment of my will, and doswear to persevere in this my chosen work unto the end.Parsons’ personalization was followed by the Oath of the Abyss or “GreatObligation” that Aleister Crowley took and that is contained in his 1908 diary“John St. John” in The Equinox vol. I, number 2 special supplement:Then did I take upon myself the Great Obligation as follows:I. I, O.M. & c., a member of the Body of God, hereby bind myself on behalf ofthe whole Universe, even as we are now physically bound unto the cross ofsuffering:II. that I will lead a pure life, as a devoted ser vant of the Order:III. that I will understand all things:IV. that I will love all things:V. that I will perform all things and endure all things:VI. that I will continue in the Knowledge and Conversation of My Holy GuardianAngel:VII. that I will work without attachment:VIII. that I will work in truth:IX. that I will rely only upon myself:X. that I will interpret every phenomenon as a par ticular dealing of God withmy soul.As a part of this v enture, Parsons prepared two important papers: Analysis By AMaster of the T emple, which is autobiogr aphical in nature, and The Book ofAntiChrist. Analysis seems to have been prepared prior to P arsons’ attempt tocr oss the Ab yss, as “F rater Belarion” speaks to Parsons in the third person,saying “I await you in the City of the Pyr amids.”Subsequently writing as Belarion, Parsons refers to the OTO as “an excellenttraining school for adepts, but hardly an appropriate Order for themanifestation of Thelema,” a statement tantamount to heresy. Obviously, he wasfrustrated by attempts to discipline him, and his notion of Thelema w as almostfundamentalist, based on little mor e than Liber OZ. Trying to make lemonade outof lemons, he writes in the thir d per son, “The e xperience with the OTO and Aerojet w ere needed to dispel y our romanticism, self deception, and r elianceon others. Betty was one link in the pr ocess designed to tear y ou away fromthe no w unneeded Oedipus comple x, the o vervaluation of women and romanticlove.”Evidently on account of such failur es, Parsons listed seven things to beginworking on immediately:Works of the Wand—of the Will alone avail in this state. No other weapons shouldbe used, no other ritual save the hymn to the Unnamed One in the Anthem of the[Gnostic] Mass.You should be meticulous in all obser vations pertaining to the Will, even themost petty . Fulfill all obligations and pr omises, undertake nothing which youcannot fulfill, be pr ompt in the discharge of each responsibility.Be neat in personal and domestic habits; indicate your self respect to yourself.Do not become unduly involved with any person, and practice all your hard-earnedwisdom in your relations with women.Set up your personal af fairs in business or der. Keep your accounts current andyour papers neatly filed.Finish your poetr y for publication. Finish the synthesis of the Tarot and start work on the pr eparation of the lessons of class instruction from your book.Pay no attention to any phenomena whatsoever, and continue in a sober andresponsible way of life under all circumstances.Originally in Crowley’s play The Ship, which he wrote shortly after learning theK ey of the OTO, “The Hymn to the Unnamed One” is recited during the GnosticMass , wher e it is r eferred to as the “Anthem.” Written to portr ay theessence of that K ey in dr amatic form, the hymn invokes the “ centre and secretof the Sun/And that most holy mystery/Of which vehicle am I.” 43[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-43]After taking the oath, which he and Smith both signed, P arsons endured anunspecified 40-da y or deal—longer than the entir e Babalon Working—thatprobably involved a retreat of some sort and fasting. He emer ged to claim thegr ade of a Master of the T emple. Parsons was 33 when he took the Oath of theAbyss; Crowley was 34 when he attempted the same. Little survives of Parsons’account; all we have is his statement in The Book of AntiChrist . Parsons shouldhave kept detailed records of his attempt at crossing the Abyss, but if suchrecords existed they must ha ve been lost or destr oyed. It is doubtful hesucceeded in his attempt.In or der to try to r econstruct what P arsons might ha ve done to cross theAbyss, we need to review what Crowley himself did in this regard. It ma y not bethe same pr ocedure as that attempted b y Parsons, but it was in print at thattime as The Vision and the Voice, and Parsons did in fact idolize Cr owley, suchthat he pr obably stuck to the original, at least to some degr ee. It isimportant to note that crossing the Abyss is a part of the A∴A∴’s doctrine, andhas nothing to do with the OTO. In fact, b y this time P arsons had resignedfrom the latter.Crowley carried out his Ab yss-crossing process during 1908 and 1909. A key partof this working was a 30-day walk across the Algerian desert, upon which he tookalong Frater Omnia Vincam, known in the “world of men” as Victor Neubur g, theacolyte who w as in love with him and received Crowley’s abuse. Although thisendea vor was a full three years before Crowley would learn the sexual secret ofthe OTO, on one occasion he used Neubur g in an act of se x magic, taking thesubmissive role to Neuburg’s dominance. Neuburg took notes as Cr owley describedwhat he saw.The cr ossing of the Ab yss is part of the old Enochian s ystem, which posits auniverse of 3 0 concentric Air es (or Aethyrs) with the earth at the center,much as the ancients did with the se ven planetary spheres, although there areother arrangements. The 30th Aire is the lowest; hence, it is the closest to theearth. The Fir st Aire is thus the highest, but ther e ar e said to be unkno wn,unnumber ed Air es above it.Each Aire, as seen in the discussion of the Babalon W orking, has its angels,kings, Seniors, cherubs, etc. associated with it. W orking with each Air e requires inv oking these entities , just as P arsons invoked EXARP in January1946. The full ritual is full of consecrations, hexagrams and pentagrams, andtakes at least an hour to perform for each Aire. The ritual must be recited frommemory, and “vibrated” in the original Enochian language.The Air es ar e tr ansversed in r everse or der, as the highest numbered Aire isclosest to the earth. Crowley worked with the 30th Aire first, then the 29th,and so on. On the 2 1st day, the day of his w orking with the 1 0th Air e, Crowley had his Ab yss-crossing experience. The 10th Aire is guarded by the demonChoronzon, who dwells in the Abyss.For Crowley, Aires 30 through 11 involved astral vision (“skrying in theAethyrs”). The working of the 10th Aire involved a full-blown possessionexperience in which Cr owley’s psyche was overtaken by Choronzon for a time .Neubur gwas e xtremely frightened b y this intense change in his usuallyamicable master , and w as glad that Crowley was bound inside a consecr atedcircle. Unlike the inv ocations of the pr evious nights, there was no physicalcontact between the two men. The possession lasted until the energy produced bythe blood of three sacrificed pigeons ran out, and then it ended.Crowley emerged with his sanity intact, having survived a face-to-face encounterwith the blind forces of the Abyss. He had tasted madness and survived. He hadcr ossed the Abyss by giving up his ego. He was now a Magister Templi (Master ofthe Temple) in the A∴A∴.Crowley scryed the remaining Aires during the course of the next nine days, thenfinished the rite (and his desert w alk). A detailed account of these endeavorsand his ordeal can be found in Crowley’s The Vision and the Voice, as well as inhis Confessions.As noted, it is unclear to what extent Parsons emulated his master in his Abyssworking, for which he may very well have retired to the Mojave desert, as Crowley had to that of Algeria. This period w as a low point in Parsons’ life: hisformer glory lost, he w as employed at a gas station. The w orking lasted 40 days, whatever form it took—longer than the entir e Babalon Working, and longerthan Cr owley’s own Algerian w orking with Neubur g. Unfortunately, most of therecords documenting the endea vor ar e no w gone , if the y even existed.Whatever form it did tak e, this oper ation w as P arsons’ Black Pilgrimage,foretold by Babalon three years earlier in Liber 49, vs. 33, 58, and 61. Afterthe end of the 40 days, Parsons wrote a two-page document called The Book ofAntiChrist . In it he predicted the manifestation of Babalon upon the earthwithin seven years, which he would not have done had he consider ed Camer on tobe Babalon. He also pr edicted that an entire nation would embrace Thelema.Babalon told him these things w ould come to pass only if he surviv ed the ne xtse ven years. He did not, and it is odd that Babalon, or P arsons’ own psyche,or whatever it was, would even suggest that the young man might not, as if it orhe knew his sad fate.In “The Black Pilgrimage,” which was the first part of The Book of AntiChrist, Parsons compar ed himself to se veral infamous but obscure figures from the past.He referred to them as past lives of his, though probably just as a literarydevice. The first, Simon Magus, was the legendary fir st-century Samaritanmagician who made a living selling miracles to the populace. According to theBible, after his baptism by Philip (A cts 8:9 ff), Simon continued to peddle hisw ares under a Christian guise , giving rise to our w ord “Simon y.” Simonpreached a gnostic message in which his consort Helen, found in a brothel, w asthe fallen Sophia (i.e ., wisdom) whom he had redeemed.The second past life was Gilles de R etz (usually spelled “R ais” or “Raiz”), achild tortur er and killer also kno wn as Bluebear d the pirate. P arsonsmentioned an incident appar ently not documented elsewhere, in which de R ais(ca. 1404-1430) allegedly tried to make Joan of Arc (ca. 1412-1431) the “Queenof the Witchcr aft.”The thir d figur e w as “F rancis Hepburne , Earl Bothw ell,” but Parsons musthave been referring to Francis Stewart, the fifth Earl of Bothwell. The fourthEarl had been named Hepburn. The fifth Earl was the “ Arch-Dianist” of Scotland,meaning the spiritual leader of the Diana-worshipping witches, who sa w in Stewart the incarnation of the “horned god.” He also had a claim to the throne,toward which he dir ected his supernatur al efforts . In fact, Ste wart w as thefir st cousin of King James VI of Scotland, the same murderous King James I ofEngland whose tr anslation of the Bible r emains a standard, and who had JohnDee arr ested. As noted, the King fear ed witchcr aft greatly, and he sa w inhis cousin the v ery devil whom he kne w the witches w orshiped. When Ste wartbusted into the King’ s house on July 24, 1593, the King asked whether Stewartcame for his life or for his soul. Had James died heirless , Ste wart could have claimed the throne. Some of Stewart’s anti-Christian writings are even usedin our age. Parsons mentioned him specifically in r egard to a Gille Duncan,about whom there seems to be no information.The fourth life w as Count Cagliostr o, the famous 18th-century alchemist whostudied under St. Germain, the supposedly immortal miracle worker, and Seraphina ( AKA Lorenza Feliciana), Cagliostr o’s wife. During the witchhunts , Seraphina testified against her husband—admittedly under the threat of torture—andhe was sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life in prison, andSeraphina was allowed to retire to a monastery of nuns .44[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-44]The common thread in all of these past liv es is the poor r elationship with women: P arsons w as still beating himself up for ha ving trusted Betty. Inaddition to pummeling himself, Parsons also trounced Christianity and “the lyingpriests, conniving judges, [and] blackmailing police,” ending the second part ofThe Book of AntiChrist , called “The Manifesto of the AntiChrist,” with thefollo wing:I, BELARION, ANTICHRIST, in the year 1949 of the r ule of the Black Brotherhoodcalled Christianity, do make my Manifesto to all men. And I, THE ANTICHRIST,come among you, saying:An end to the pretense, and lying hypocrisy of Christianity.An end to the servile virtues, and superstitious restrictions.An end to the slave morality.An end to prudery and shame, to guilt and sin, for these are of the only evilunder the Sun, that is fear.An end to all authority that is not based on courage and manhood, to theauthority of lying priests, conniving judges, blackmailing police, andAn end to the servile flattery and cajolery of mobs, the corona-tions ofmediocrities, the ascension of dolts.An end to r estriction and inhibition, for I, THE ANTICHRIST, am come among youpr eaching the Word of the BEAST 666, which is, “There is no law beyond Do whatthou wilt.”And I, BELARION, ANTICHRIST, do lift up my voice and pr ophesy, and I say: Ishall bring all men to the law of the BEAST 666, and in His law I shall conquerthe world.And within seven years of this time, BABALON, THE SCARLET WOMAN HILARION willmanifest among ye, and bring this my work to its fruition.An end to conscription, compulsion, r egimentation, and the tyranny of falselaws.And within nine years a nation shall accept the Law of theB EAST 666 in my name,and that nation will be the first nation of ear th.And all who accept me the ANTICHRIST and the law of the BEAST 666, shall beaccursed and their joy shall be a thousandfold greater than the false joys ofthe false saints.And in my name BELARION shall they work miracles, and confound our enemies, andnone shall stand before us.Therefore I, THE ANTICHRIST call upon all the Chosen and elect and upon all men,come for th now in the name of Liber ty, that we may end for ever the tyranny ofthe Black Br otherhood.Witness my hand and seal on this [deleted ] day of [month deleted], 1949, thatis the year of BABALON 4066.“Hilarion” was the magical motto of the Scarlet W oman Jeanne Foster, anAmerican member of the A∴A∴, whom Crowley called “the Cat.” Foster had completeda w orking with Cr owley in 1915 that he later belie ved pr oduced a MagicalChild in the form of Charles Stansfeld Jones (Frater Achad). The name “Hilarion”comes from one of the “Mahatmas ,” or Ascended Master s, of Theosoph y: HilarionSmerdis, who was said to have been the angel who dictated the book of Revelation to St. John of P atmos. It is unkno wn wh y P arsons referred toBabalon by this name, which was later one of Camer on’s magical names as well.She may have chosen it because of this document.On May 8, 1949, some months after the Abyss working—and possibly because of it,in P arsons’ mind—he w as hired by the Hughes Aircraft Company. At that time, hewrote Crowley, “It has now been almost a year since I last wr ote—at that time Iwas near mental and financial collapse. Since that time I have laboriouslygained some sort of mental equilibrium and gradually regained something of aposition in my old field in a lar ge aircraft company. My one aim is to r ebuildmyself.”Also in 1949, Cameron returned from Mexico and made Parsons a green box with theHebr ew letter shin painted in red on the lid. He kept his Babalon Workingdocuments in it.In January of 195 1, Parsons made a striking disco very and wrote Germer:I have the text of Dee’s skrying in the Seventh Aire, which as he said “. . . soterrified him that, beseeching God to have mercy upon me, I finally answer edthat I will fr om this day for ward meddle no more herein.” The Voice, speakingfrom Kelley, resulted in a sinister dissociation of Kelley’s personality . Theparallel with my own Working with Ron is appalling. After this Kelley r obbedDee, absconded with his wife, and developed [“continued” would be moreappropriate] a criminal confidence car eer . . . In view of the fact that thismss [manuscript] was unknown to Hubbar d and I [sic], the parallelism is r eallyextraor dinary. I have another prophecy in Khaled Khan,45[bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-45] which I shall send later.This realization of history r epeating itself ma y have hit P arsons too late todo an ything about it, but he w as not defeated. P arsons worked in thePropellants Section at Hughes, and by March 1950 he was listing his title as “Group Leader in Char ge of Pr opellants, Propulsion and Launching Group of theResearch and Development Laboratories.” Circumstances had gone well from thedate of his hiring May 8, 1949 until June 195 0, at which time the Isr aelis,with whom he had been negotiating since October 1948 via the American TechnionSociety, requested a detailed proposal for “the construction of Explosive Plantsand the development of rockets and other armaments,” which Parsons would design,build and operate. In order to accomplish this goal, he planned to r elocate tothe ne wly formed Israel. According to Parsons’ FBI file he negotiated with noless than the head of the American T echnion Society , a man named Rosenfeldt.Parsons worked on the proposal in July and August. In September, Hughes had himw orking on a pr oposal for a “R ocket Pr opellant Loading Plant.” The pricingdata in this pr oposal was what Parsons needed to finish his pr oposal to theIsr aelis. He took 17 of his o wn documents fr om Hughes , man y of which w erestill designated as “Confidential” or “Restricted,” and passed them on viaCameron to a friend for typing. His FBI file says this (female) friend w as apart of the typing pool at Hughes . This incident occurr ed, in Parsons’ ownwords, “about the 16th of September,” at the recommendation of von Kármán, who was also intervie wed b y the FBI with r egard to the Chinese Tsien’s espionagecase. Von Kármán’s participation was later found to be incidental in both cases.These 17 documents were said to be rough drafts of the proposal he was writingfor Hughes , but the y were mostly old JATO documents Parsons was using to padhis résumé. His “friend,” whom he said he had kno wn for fiv e y ears, turnedhim in, and on September 25 the FBI confiscated the documents. On September 26at noon, they interviewed Parsons. His signed statement denies any wrongdoing,relating his claim that he w as merely using excerpts from those documents,specifically the pricing data, to help complete his proposal to the Israelis,who had not seen any of the documents, or e ven the e xcerpts. In fact, the onlyper son who had seen them was his “friend” the typist. P arsons said he kne wthat she and her husband both had confidential clearances, so he didn’t see where an y violation of security had occurr ed. This incident transpired before themore recent and restrictive “Need to Kno w” rules were in effect.Parsons did admit that removing Hughes Aircraft property without permission wasa “serious error of judgement,” but he had a property pass that he sho wed tothe guar d when he r emoved the paper s, a common pr actice, Parsons told them.Displa ying his char acteristic trust and generosity of spirit, in his statementParsons nobly absolved his “friend” of an y complicity. He further said that heintended to check with the State Department when his pr oposal was complete,before sending it to Israel, where he only planned to work on projects that theU.S. had approved, and that the Technion Society had been set up to regulatesuch things.Copies of Parsons’ statement were forwarded to the Air Force, the OSI, and theCIA. The Air Force replied that the incident was an Army matter. Subsequentstatements were taken, and many acquaintances of Parsons and Camer on wereinterviewed. One referred to the couple as “characters and scr ewballs.” Anothercalled Parsons a “crack-pot.” R eferences to earlier inv estigations of his “cult” at 1 003 S. Orange Grove occupy much of the FBI file. One witness claimedto have gone to the house for a “w eekend party” that turned into a rite whereineverybody removed their str eet clothes, put on cer emonial robes, and weresubsequently drugged.Another witness’ statement bears quoting in its entirety:[T]he Parsons are an odd and unusual pair in that they do not live by thecommonly accepted code of mar ried life, and are both very fascinated byanything unusual or morbid such as voodooism, cults, homosexuality, and religious practices that ar e ‘dif ferent.’ Subject seems very much in love withhis wife but she is not at all affectionate and does not appear to return hisaffection. [Two lines deleted.] She is the dominating personality of the two andcontrols the activities and thinking of subject to a very considerable degree.It is the opinion [deleted] if subject wer e to have been in any way willfullyinvolved in any activities of an intentional espionage nature, it would probablyhave been on the instigation of his wife.An FBI memorandum of January 27, 195 1 sho ws Parsons was at that date stillunder inv estigation for “ espionage,” stating that Parsons intended to turn thedocuments o ver to an individual who had offered him the promise of a positionin Isr ael. It also describes him as a “former emplo yee” of Hughes , meaningthat he had been fired b y then. Appar ently he w as fir ed immediately inSeptember , when the breach of security was discovered. In the file is also arouting slip signed by J. Edgar Hoover.In Mar ch 195 1, P arsons mo ved fr om the house at 424 Arr oyo Terrace inPasadena to 1200 Esplanade in Redondo Beach, California, the addr ess giv en b yJim Br andon but which does not appear in Parsons’ FBI file. Other addressesprovided for Parsons and Cameron are 34 16 Manhattan A venue and 32 12 HighlandA venue, both in Manhattan Beach, California.On October 25, 1951, the Assistant United States Attorney decided not toprosecute the case, even though on December 15, 195 0 seven additionalclassified papers were found to be in P arsons’ possession during the cour se ofthe inv estigation. These additional paper s had highly technical titles such as“Ignition Studies of Restricted Burning Solid Propellant Jet Motor s.”Curiously, the titles of the original 17 documents Parsons took (13 finishedpapers and four drafts) are still censored from the FBI file as of this writing.Although it is unverified, it has also been said that Parsons inadvertentlyemployed jargon used by the Manhattan Project, the U.S. nuclear weapons programestablished in 1942 by Enrico Fermi.On January 17, 1952, after one year and four months of investigation, the Boardinformed Parsons this they were pulling his clearance, which was neverreinstated. The lack of reinstatement is curious, as officials atWright-Patterson Field informed the investigators that the entire project hadbeen declassified right after the w ar, even though some of the individual papers were still classified. Indeed, the y recommended declassification of the papers in Parsons’ possession, as most of them w ere rather old. R egardless, hissuperior s just didn’t trust him an ymore. The combined effects of se veral investigations into the magical and se xual activities at the house on South Orange Grove Avenue, alleged communistic activities, previous loss of clearance,and two separate cases of taking classified documents all added up to mistrust.This tragedy hastened Parsons’ decline.The investigation stressed Parsons, and sometime in late 195 0 he turned to hischosen form of spirituality for r elief, despite its tr oublesome implications .Expr essing his discontent, P arsons wr ote a short text addressed to theMoonchild who was yet to come. The text was to be a part of the Book of Babalonand read mournfully:My daughter, it is now four years since I enter ed the infer nal chapel, and partook of the sacrament of your incar nation. Since then, much that was prophesiedat that time has come to pass. I have been stripped of wealth, of honor, and oflove; and have participated not once but twice in my own betrayal, as it wasforetold. But how else would I come to the understanding needful to make thisyour Book?For thereby I have taken the Oath of the Abyss, and entered my rightful city ofChorazin, and seen ther ein the past lives whereby I came to this, the grossestof all my Workings. Now it would seem that the further matters of the prophecyare at work; events press on tumultuously, and ‘T ime Is’ is write lar ge acrossthe sky [see Liber 49, vs. 3].And against the time when ‘T ime Has Been’ looms up in blood and fire tocomplete this labor , for your instr uction and for the instruction and help ofall men and women who shall sur vive that day.God knows, ther e is much unsaid and badly said; obscurity , peevishness, hasteand bad workmanship mar these pages, until sometimes I wonder if I do not dodisser vice to our cause. Ther e is so much needful, so little available. Yet,since I have been chosen, I do my best.Although I have had indications, they ar e not cer tain. I do not know who youare, nor where you are at this writing; nor have I ever sought to know. This Ido know—that you ar e incarnate, that you will manifest at the appointed time,to car ry on the work that is from the beginning: that shall be until we haveall entered the City of the Pyramids. The links ar e cer tain—the Beast 666 [Crowley], the Pole Star 132 [Wilfred Smith], the dark passionate star Regina[Kahl], the bright deceitful star Cassup [Betty Nor thrup], the disastrous starof the White Scribe [Hubbard], and the wandering star, now nameless, in whom youwere incarnated.It is through them that this work is possible. T o them, you are BABALON, andthrough you to all men it is dedicated.Parsons didn’t abandon demonic spirituality , or his lo ve for women. He andCameron reunited after a short separation, moving into the coach house of the F.G. Cruikshank mansion at 1 071 S. Orange Gr ove A ve. Cruikshank still liv edin the house , while Parsons and Camer on and se veral others rented rooms abovethe garage at 1 0711/2 S. Orange Grove, just three doors down from theParsonage. At this location, P arsons spent his nights painstakingly creating anexact duplicate of Dee’ s Enochian tablets, which have not survived.Prior to the FBI investigation, Parsons had been planning to quit his job atHughes Air craft and finance a trip to Isr ael to pursue the proposal he hadbeen trying to sell them for se veral years. Parsons and Cameron were nowheading to Mexico to test an explosive “more powerful than an ything yet invented,” to quote filmmak er R enate Druks, who was an acquaintance of Camer on.Parsons was also still working on what he called “The Gnosis” and “The Witchcraft,” and reportedly had employment possibilities in Spain.During this period, in one of his last letters to Karl Germer (Frater Saturnus),Parsons wrote:No doubt you will be delighted to hear fr om an adept who has undertaken theoperation of his H.G.A. [Holy Guar dian Angel] in accord with our traditions.The operation began auspiciously with a chromatic display of psychosomaticsymptoms, and progressed rapidly to acute psychosis. The operator has alternated satisfactorily between manic hysteria and depr essing melancholy stupor onappr oximately 40 cycles, and satisfactor y progress has been maintained insocial ostracism, economic collapses and mental disassociation.These statements are mentioned not in any vainglorious spirit of conceit, butrather that they may ser ve as comfort and inspiration to other aspirants on thePath.Now I’m off to the wilds of Mexico for a period, also in pursuit of the elusiveH.G.A. before winding up in the guar d finally via the booby hotels, thegraveyar d, or—? If the final, you can tell all the little Practicuses [3° = 8inthe A∴A∴] that I wouldn’t have missed it for anything.[Signed] No one. Once called 210.Although he had intimately e xpressed to Germer some of the strain he w asunder, Parsons hated the German man he wr ote, who succeeded Cr owley as head ofthe OTO, and the letter w as actually intended to sneer at Germer , as Parsonswas leaving behind another job at a filling station for much gr eater things.Expressing the glory of his life , Parsons wrote a poem, one of his lastsurviving, called “Star ,” which closes the v olume Songs for the Witch Woman:I rememberWhen I was a starIn the nightA moving, burning emberAmid the brightClouds of star fireGoing deathwardTo the womb.Oh moonRed moon of my desireMy sisters’ and my brothers’ fireDown the great hall of heroesI the star seedWooed the incredible flower. I aloneMy need, my powerattained the dark houseand my bride. I rememberWhen I was a godIn my hourand like a god I diedBy the deep waters,Crucified. And I dreamedand the great powersmoved over meAnd a voice cried Go free, star, go freeSeek the dark homeOn the wild skyGood bye, star, good bye.029 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_029_r1.gif]"},{"pageContent":"tenDeath and BeyondBy 1952, Parsons’ various appeals and endea vors seemed to ha ve been w orking,as good fortune appeared to be shining upon him again at last. In fact, he w asworking for se veral different concerns, including one with JPL employee CharlesBartley, who had a pyrotechnics license and let Parsons store explosives at hisP acoima facility, at which the tw o worked as consultants doing special effectse xplosions for films . Parsons also was working at least part-time for theBermite P owder Compan y in Saugus, California, where Cameron helped him mixexplosives. And he had the job at the service station.This seeming upturn was short-lived, however, as the ultimate catastrophe la yjust ar ound the corner . Six y ears earlier, on Mar ch 2, 1946, Hubbar d hadchanneled an eerily pr ophetic message , after which, Parsons wrote, the ex-Navyman was “pale and sweaty”: “She [Babalon] is the flame of life, power ofdarkness, she destroys with a glance, she ma y take th y soul. She feeds uponthe death of men. Beautiful—horrible . . . She shall absorb thee, and thou shaltbecome living flame before She incarnates.”In addition, utilizing one of the tw o abilities Camer on claimed Parsons hadtaught her, i.e., to use her epileptic seizures to enter the astral plane (theother one being the tarot), Cameron claimed to have discovered a bottle ofmercury beneath the floorboards in his laboratory, which, if P arsons hadplanted it ther e, was extremely careless for someone so e xperienced withdanger ous chemicals . Ho wever, Parsons was indeed somewhat reckless withchemicals, which in the end may have been his doom.On Tuesday, June 17, 1952 at 5:08 p.m. an e xplosion erupted in the lower levelof 10711/2 S. Orange Grove Ave. that was heard as far as a mile away. Tragicallyand horribly, Parsons was at the center of it. A second e xplosion occurredalmost immediately, as if set off b y the first. Flame consumed Parsons, asBabalon had predicted, and his right for earm w as blo wn off so completely thatonly a fe w small pieces of it were found. The blast broke his other arm andboth legs, left a “gaping hole” in his jaw, and shredded his shoes. Parsons wasconscious when upstair s neighbors dragged him out fr om under an old-fashionedwashtub, which can be seen in a photo r eproduced in the Los Angeles Times onJune 18.The lower level of the coach house had been a stable , and the upper level hadbeen servants’ quarters, which had been turned into apartments that P arsons,his mother , and Camer on occupied until June 1. At the time of the blast, Parsons’ mother, Ruth, had taken a summer position as caretaker for one Mrs.Carpenter, who was out of town with her husband, residing at 21 W. Glenarm St.with her friend Helen Rowan who was confined to a wheelchair.The explosion blew the stable door s from their hinges , knocked over two walls,and tore a hole in the ceiling as w ell as a hole in the floor. Smaller doorsand windows were blown from their frames, and two greenhouses 25 feet away wereshattered. A grand piano upstairs shifted enough for one of its legs to br eak,and a chandelier fell. Windows were broken on the home next door. ArtistSalvatore Ganci, one of the upstairs residents, was on the phone when the explosion occurred. “I was lifted off the couch b y a violent blast,” he told thePasadena Star-News reporter. The apartment w as shared by 21-year-old Jo AnnPrice , an actr ess and model, as w ell as actor Martin Foshaug, 31, and hismother Alta. No one upstair s was hurt.Ganci and Mr s. F oshaug rushed do wnstairs and pulled P arsons from thewreckage, propping him up against a wall until paramedics could get there.Parsons was coherent enough to giv e them instructions as he w as loaded intothe ambulance and tak en to Huntington Memorial Hospital at 1 00 Congress St. inP asadena. The remarkable man died there at 5:45 p.m., some 37 minutes after theexplosion. In March 1946, P arson had cryptically written, “ And in that da y[the manifestation of Babalon] my work will be accomplished, and I shall beblown away upon the breath of the father.” As Parsons lay dying, according toJohn Bluth, his last words are said to have been, “I wasn’t done.” According toJane Wolfe, Cameron related them as, “Who will take care of me no w?” But it was not he who needed looking after , as he had passed on into the other sidethat he had so fervently tried to bring into this world.From his birth, both Parsons and his mother shared a strong bond. After thesickening tragedy, Ruth Parsons and Helen Rowan went to a friend’s home at 424Arr oyo Terrace, where her son and Camer on had been staying since June 1, whichwas described in a newspaper as a “two-story mansion.” Another friend, Mrs.Nedia Kibort, age 59, of 32 0 Waverly Drive, was in the house with them, wher epr esumably they sought a little comfort after the dr eadful news. Ruth wasdrinking heavily, and took tw o Nembutals fr om a pr escription she receivedafter the explosion. When she learned of her son’s death she shouted, “I can’tstand to liv e without him. I adored him.” She also said that she had a gunupstairs and then gulped the remainder of the sleeping pills—23 or 43, dependingon the account—while Mr s. Rowan looked on helplessly. Another friend, a nur senamed Nellie Smith, arrived soon after and found R uth slumped o ver in a livingroom chair. She phoned Dr . J.R. Huntsman of 65 N. Madison A ve., who pronounced Mr s. P arsons dead at 9:06 p.m. Her death w as investigated by Lt.John C. Elliott, who had been at the scene of her son’s death, and by Sgt. WoodyPollard.Cameron w as buying supplies for the Me xico trip at the corner grocery when thee xplosion occurr ed. The Pasadena Independent reported Cameron as being “stoicin the face of her double loss.” She told reporters and police that she and herhusband w ere headed to Mexico for a vacation. Their luggage was sitting in thehallway at 424 Arroyo Terrace when Ruth committed suicide. Others told adifferent story.Cameron’s brother Robert, age 28, of 125 N. Rampart Blvd., stated that Parsonswas headed to Mexico on business, “the nature of which was v ery secr etive.” Presumably R obert w ould kno w, as he and Cameron’s other brother, sister andfather all worked at JPL. Someone else told the Independent that Parsons wasgoing to set up his o wn business in Mexico, but Cameron insisted it was merelyan extended trip. The amount of baggage, however, indicated a long-term stay. Infact, the couple w ere headed next to Israel, where they intended to raise afamily.Motorcycle officer Ernie Ho vard w as the fir st policeman on the scene of theexplosion and was later joined by Donald M. Harding, a Pasadena police for cecriminologist. Har ding found numer ous containers of explosives, many of whichhad already been placed outside by Parsons, in preparation for the trip, which was obviously not for sightseeing. The legality of the e xplosives wasquestioned, and the 58th Arm y Or dnance Disposal Unit w as called in fr om Fort MacArthur to help determine the cause of the e xplosion, as well as toinspect the immediate area and the house at 424 Arroyo Terrace for further explosives. As photogr aphers took flash photos , Har ding shielded certain ofthe r emaining bottles, afraid that the light w ould set them off as well. TheDisposal Unit removed the rest of the explosives from the pr emises, and the investigators and other s began to speculate as to what caused theblast—nitroglycerin? Rocket fuels? Or the more exotic-sounding trinitrobenzeneor PETN? 46 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-46]In addition to the e xplosion, Har ding found numer ous scientific notes in thedebris, most of which contained chemical formulas. One interesting documentcontained Parsons’ notes concerning industrial explosions: “Texas City DisasterReport: 433 dead, 128 missing. [The explosive] cannot be detonated with riflebullets , blasting caps or dynamite.” Parsons also had notes about a Los Angeleselectroplating company explosion in 1947 that killed 15, and another e xplosionat Aerojet that killed eight. He had been a member of the coroner’s jury on the1947 incident.A more curious fragment was obviously not a part of his pr ofessional work. Thenote r ead, “Let me kno w th y misery totally . And spare not and be not spared.Sacrament and Crucifixion. Oh my passion and shame . . . Mother s . . . Sisters. . .” Unfortunately, he got his morbid wish, as did his de voted mother.Harding eventually determined that the blast occurred just behind Parsons, andto his right, just above floor level. Had the building not been of heavy timberconstruction, it probably would have been leveled. As it w as, the entire halfof the lo wer level containing his lab was gutted. Firemen reported that theynoticed a “funny odor” when they arrived on the scene. Interestingly,considering she had purportedly found mercury there, Cameron said that theexplosion occurred beneath the floorboards, lifting them up.Martin Foshaug said that Parsons “had been e xperimenting in an effort to produce a ‘Super’ fog effect for motion pictur es,” but this work certainly hadnothing to do with the blast that killed him, since Parsons had left his specialeffects job with the Bermite P owder Company on the previous Friday, June 13.On June 19, the newspapers reported that the cause of the e xplosion had beendetermined to be “fulminate of mer cury,” a very sensitive and powerfuldetonator that Army Ordnance had stopped using because of the number of deathsit had caused. Ho wever, the size of the explosion seems e xcessive forfulminate of mer cury. Har ding, who had just joined the P asadena police force, was assigned to his first investigation with the P arsons blast. He could have both been inexperienced and had based his conclusions on hearsay, rather thanscience, about mercury. Harding was told by a neighbor that Parsons wasmanufacturing the mer cury explosive (illegally) in the gar age laboratory. Itwas to be his last batch, Parsons had told the neighbor. Obviously, he w asright. Har ding searched for other stor age places Parsons might ha vemaintained, and stated that enough e xplosives remained in the lab to “blo w uphalf the block.”Harding’s determination of the bomb device’s origin was based on his discoveryin the rubble of ingr edients needed to make fulminate of mercury. Shr apnelfrom a coffee can w as found in the w ooden floor and in the w alls, radiatingout fr om the hole at gr ound zero, which led Harding to surmise that Parsonsmust have reached for the can when it dr opped but w asn’t quick enough. This development, Harding inferred, was why the e xplosion occurred low to the floorand why Parsons’ right arm was missing, since it w as closest to the blast.Harding believed Parsons was mixing the chemical in the can when it dropped.Fulminate of mercury, he reasoned, “is made w et and gets more sensitive as itdries . A little friction, per cussion, heat or agitation is enough to set itoff.”Based on Har ding’s findings , Detectiv e Lieutenant Cecil H. Burlingame wastold by the coroner’s office that no inquest would be held. After an autops yperformed the ne xt day b y Deputy Cor oner I.G. Mcfarland, the death w as ruledaccidental and attributed to “multiple injuries of entir e body .” Burlingametold r eporters that police had received reports in 1942 that Parsons wasillegally storing explosives at 1003 S. Orange Grove Ave. Nevertheless, a searchconducted in conjunction with the FBI had turned up nothing.The Pasadena Independent talked to J.H. Arnold of the Bermite Powder Compan y,who told them that P arsons had sta yed long enough with his company to finish aspecial effects pr oject. Parsons had, in fact, been w orking on a “r ocket propellant detonation and pyrotechnic short-interv al dela y” project, which w asa confidential program at the compan y. Contrary to Camer on’s testimony, hiscoworkers related that he had told them he w as heading to Me xico to continuehis research with explosives and miniatur e special effects. Arnold had askedhim to stay long enough to see the tests of the confidential project, but Parsons was eager to get to Me xico. “He had been working har d,” Arnold told theinv estigators, also stating that Parsons was extremely safety-conscious . SaidArnold, “He w orked carefully, had a thorough knowledge of his job and wasscrupulously neat.” But Har ding called him “ criminally negligent” in the w ayhe handled the explosives at his home lab. Arnold was surprised to hear thatParsons had so man y explosives at home, which police learned had been there atleast six months. Arnold added that Parsons at one time had his o wn powdermagazine near Rialto, which w as a legal storage place. His home , however, wasin obvious violation of the Pasadena fire marshal’s code. In addition, Arnoldnoted, six or eight months earlier P arsons talked about going into the dynamitebusiness. Other comments came from T.E. Beehan, Secretary-Treasurer of Aerojet,who described P arsons as a “loner” and said, “He lik ed to wander, but he wasone of the top men in the field.”In their r eportage about his life and death, the Pasadena Independent dug upsome of the older stories about P arsons when he was at 1003 S. Orange Grove andrecalled that in 1942 a letter had been sent from San Antonio, T exas by “A RealSoldier,” who wr ote that a “black magic” cult was operating in the house. Thesame Detective Lt.Burlingame had inv estigated the letter incident and w as told b y Parsons thatthe “ cult” was merely a “non-sectarian and non-political fraternity” which“held open forums on Sunda y afternoons, and discussed philosophy, religion,personal freedom, and fortune telling.”However, in 1944 police investigated a small fire at the house, during which investigation Detective O.A. Nelson found “ considerable paraphernalia . . . whichindicated that spiritual seances ma y have been held in the house .” SaidNelson, “It appear s to be the home of some type of secret society.”Nevertheless, the matter was dropped.Smelling a good story , the sensationalistic Independent announced in itsobituary that on July 19 “secret rites” were held for John Parsons at Turner &Stevens Mortuary, Marengo Ave. and Holly St. However, the funeral home referredto the ceremony as a “private prayer service .” The obituary used his birth name, Marv el, and reported that Cameron was the only survivor. It also stated thatcremation took place earlier that da y at the Liv e Oak Cr ematory and that hisbody was embalmed by W.T. Stahlman. The Social Security number giv en on hisdeath certificate , pr esumably pr ovided by Cameron, is incorr ect and belongsto a Vir ginia Wilson, also of California, who had been born the same y ear as Parsons and who lived until 1980.On July 2 0, a priv ate service w as held for R uth Parsons, also b y Turner &Ste vens, and her body w as cremated as well. She was survived by a Mr s. EmmaAldrich of Santa Monica, California, apparently no relation to lodge member Meeka Aldrich.On June 22, both the Los Angeles Times and the Pasadena Independent addressed anew development: George W. Santmyer (or Santmyers), a Los Angeles chemicalengineer w orking with Parsons in a Na val Ordnance Department r esearch projectsince January 1, suggested to the paper s that something w as amiss with the investigation. Police had found 5 00 grams of cordite (an ammunition component) andsix filter papers containing fulminate of mercury residue in Parsons’ trash can,which was either at the back of the lab or just outside it, depending on theaccount. “F or Parsons to have disposed of such materials in that manner ,” saidSantm yer, “w ould be the same as for a highly trained surgeon to operate withdirty hands. It’s completely out of char acter for him.” Criminologist Har ding,when asked, admitted that P arsons’ supposed sloppiness seemed “incongruous.”Harding also said that enough cordite and fulminate of mercury were found in thetrash to blow up the garbage truck and drivers who would have picked up the can.In his statement to the papers, Santmyer argued that someone else must have putit ther e, that P arsons would not ha ve disposed of highly dangerous explosivesat the last minute , nor w ould he ha ve prepared them for tr ansportation on along driv e into Me xico, as everything he needed to produce fulminate ofmercury could be easily pur chased once he arriv ed ther e. Santm yer alsostated that Parsons was “on the tr ail” of a completely ne w explosive that “was to be far superior to an y existing commercial blasting material” and muchsafer to handle. According to Burlingame, however, Santmyer’s questions w eren’t“sufficient to w arrant us r eopening the case .” Nevertheless, Santmyer was notthe only person who smelled something fishy in the untimely death of JohnParsons.Something else w as allegedly found after the death of P arsons that didn’t makethe 1952 Los Angeles Times . Amateur r ocket advocate Harold Chambers, whoworked at a technical bookstore in downtown Los Angeles for 40 y ears, was toldon separ ate occasions b y both Harding and Santmyer that an “odd, bizarre,fairly big box, decorated with snakes and dr agons” w as found in a tr ailer atP arsons’ r esidence. The odd bo x was found to contain home mo vies of Parsonsand mother ha ving se x, not only with each other , but also with Ruth’s “bigdog.” According to reports from Pasadena police, passed down to their friend Harold Chambers, we now have circumstantial evidence that John P arsons indeedfulfilled his goal to “ exteriorize [his] Oedipus complex.”Ruth Parsons’ “big dog” also made it difficult for police to attend to hersuicide scene . After being attack ed by R uth’s agitated beast, Pasadena policeofficers shot the dog in the head.Chambers also r eports that Don Har ding, ha ving disco vered a syringe amongthe blast debris , partially filled with a morphine-lik e substance, believesthat P arsons’ drug use contributed to his mishandling of explosives.The high-reaching pioneer Parsons was gone but not for gotten. In 1969, DarkerThan Y ou Think author Jack Williamson wr ote, “In Pasadena not long ago, walking acr oss the gr ounds of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I was jolted tosee Parsons’ name on a memorial tablet set up to honor the first martyrs tospace. He had written me once about testing multicellular solid-fuel rocketsdesigned after those in my story ‘The Crucible of Power.’ When I first heardabout his death I w ondered if m y own r ockets had killed him, but [L.] Sprague de Camp tells me that he dropped a bottle of picric acid.” It w asn’tpicric acid, but he had the right idea.Rather than any “martyrs to space ,” the JPL plaque actually honors the firstsuccessful series of JATO tests, which began on Halloween 1936. The monument was unveiled on Hallo ween 1968, the 32nd anniversary of the original date. “TheCrucible of P ower,” contained in the anthology The Best of Jack Williamson,describes the multi-cellular, solid-fuel rockets as follows: “[I]t was afour-step rocket, each step containing thousands of cellules, each of which wasa complete rocket motor with its own load of alumilloid fuel, to be fired onceand then detached.” No doubt P arsons would have also been inter ested in thesolar r eligion of the story’ s Martians, whose high priest w as called the“Lance of the Sun.”While the police w ere content to let the tr agedy stand as an accidentostensibly caused b y his pr ofessional endea vors, others felt it had to dowith the occult. In The Occult Explosion (published 1972), Nat F reedlandintervie wed filmmak er R enate Druks , who said, “Cameroun [sic] stayed with meat m y Malibu Beach house for six months, pulling herself together after Jackdied. I ha ve every reason to believe that Jack Parsons was working on some verystrange experiments, trying to create what the old alchemists called ahomunculus, a tiny artificial man with magic po wers. I think that’ s what he was working on when the accident happened.” Druks e vidently was the source ofMichael Hoffman’s statement in Apocalypse Culture that “In 1952 Parsons wasblown up in what is officially described as an accident but which others havesaid was a homunculus experiment that went bananas.” Before moving in withDruks, Cameron stayed briefly with Wilfred and Helen Parsons Smith. She alsospent time alone in the desert.Parsons’ friends did not belie ve he killed himself, at least intentionally.Indeed, he had too man y plans, as r eflected b y his dying words: “I w asn’tdone .” It is some what ironic that these w ere the dying w ords of the man whoclaimed to be the Antichrist, while , according to the gospel tale, the dyingwords of Christ were the opposite: “It is finished.”Druks, who later w orked with a vant gar de filmmak er K enneth Anger and whoalso studied magic under Jane W olfe, r elated that Parsons was going to Mexico“to experiment with his new formula for an explosive ‘more powerful thananything yet invented.’” According to JPL employee Charles Bartley, Parsons toldhim he was going there to start a fireworks company, yet von Kármán stated thatParsons told him it was an explosives factory—which is admittedly not muchdifferent—that the Mexican government had hir ed him to set up. V on Kármán alsosaid that Parsons told him the government was furnishing a 17th-century castlefor him to stay in while he was there. Since there are few if an y castles inold Me xico, perhaps P arsons or v on Kármán confused palacio for castillo.Camer on r elated a similar account but stated it w as in Baja California, rather than Me xico proper. These e xperiments were to be a step to ward their eventual plans for working with the Israelis.Decades later Camer on spoke of the e xplosion as coming fr om under thefloorboar ds, implying mur der rather than an accident or suicide. In the OTOnewsletter The Magical Link , she stated that a good suspect w as the explosives expert against whom P arsons had testified and who had been par oledimmediately prior to the fatal explosion, a r eference to Captain K ynette ofthe Los Angeles “sp y squad,” found guilty of murdering another police officerin 1938. The weapon Kynette used w as a car bomb , and P arsons’ testimony hadbeen crucial in his conviction.In recent years, one r esearcher was informed b y the City of Los Angeles’ Hallof R ecords that Parsons’ will was still sealed and that he would have to getpermission from the executor to obtain a copy. The executor was Ed F orman, whois dead. When I visited the Hall of Records, the clerk was unable to find an ylisting for Parsons’ will in the probate records for Los Angeles county. Thewill, in fact, w as never probated.On August 13, 1952, just a month after his tr agic death, People Today publisheda half-page piece on Parsons in its “People in Crime” section, which included adelightfully sinister photo of P arsons. The article was entitled “L.A.’s LustCult” and is worth quoting in full, to demonstrate the general attitude towardParsons at the time. The bold print appears in the original.Rich, rock-ribbed Pasadena, famed for its r oses, the Califor nia Institute of Technology, and as a r etirement haven for Easter n millionaires, looks like thelast place a black magic cult dedicated to sex would thrive. Never theless, theChurch of Thelema (the name means “will”), a cult practicing sexual per version,has been making converts of all ages, sexes, there since 1940. Among thebelievers: many pr ominent r esidents of the Pasadena-Los Angeles ar ea; atleast one member of Hollywood’s movie colony.The existence of the cult, r eported to police in an anonymous letter mailedfrom San Antonio, Texas, in September ’42 by “A Real Soldier” and in an October’ 44 letter, was only pr oven this June with the “accidental” death of highpriest John W . Parsons.Parsons, bushy-haired, 37-year-old scientist who was one of the inventors ofJATO (jet-assisted take-off), was killed when an explosion r ocked his lab inthe car riage house of the old F .G. Cruickshank [sic] estate along Pasadena’s“Millionair e’s Row ,” where he lived with his artist-wife and mother. Withinhours of her son’s death, the elder Mrs. Parsons had committed suicide byswallowing 50 sleeping pills. The estate, investigators soon learned, had beenthe ‘T emple’ wher e Thelemites ran their strange sexual orgies.Parsons had ser ved as high priest since the death, in ’ 44, of local prophetWilfred Smith, a disciple of Aleister Cr owley, called “the sinister man” byFrench authorities. Crowley’s chief commandment: “Take your fill of love . . .with whom ye will.”Says an ex-member: “The inner circle followed this rule, especially at the fertility rites at the spring and fall equinoxes.” Torch-carrying hooded cultists,chanting prayers to “Thou burning rapture of girls, that disport in the sunsetof passion,” concentrated on “begetting ar oyal race befor e dawn.” Otherrituals: a Black Mass, patterned on a r eligious ceremony, in which HighPriestess disr obed to tune of uninhibited chanting; “purifying” fir e tor ture.Members ar e accepted in the cult—which also existed in Chicago and New York—ona probationary basis, must pass thr ough 10 degrees before qualifying forparticipation in sex rites.With the bizarre death of Parsons and the suicide of his mother, Thelemites havegone fur ther underground. But, still active, they conducted a secret funeralfor their dead high priest.A sidebar to the article reads:Thelemites follow code set down by founder Aleister Cr owley, Englishman whodied 25 years ago after a stor my life. Expelled from France and Italy, exiledfrom England, Cr owley published his teachings under the title: Equinox. Itsgist: Do anything you please.Both the article and the sidebar contain a number of erors, including the dateof Crowley’s death, which was in reality in 1947, and of Smith’s, which was in1957.In addition, at the time of the e xplosion Parsons was not the “high priest,”since, as early as January 1946, Crowley wrote a letter naming a successor to Parsons. Indeed, b y October of the y ear Cr owley had become disillusioned withParsons and wrote to Culling, “About J.W. P. [Parsons]—all that I can say isthat I am sorry—I feel sure that he had fine ideas, but he was led astrayfirstly by Smith, then he w as robbed of his last penn y b y a confidence mannamed Hubbar d.” And in December he wrote, “I have no further interest in Jackand his adv entures; he is just a w eak-minded fool, and must go to the de vilin his own way. Requiescat in pace.”Although Crowley may have found Parsons naïve and ineffectual, there are manywho r ealize his k ey role in the aer ospace/military industries, and not a fe wwho belie ve he accomplished amazing things esoterically , lea ving behind an extraordinary legac y that included “flying saucers,” which would not besurprising considering his fervent interest in space and his attempts bothchemically and alchemically to “shoot for the star s.”030 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_030_r1.jpg]In fact, Kenneth Grant writes, “The [Babalon] Working began . . . just prior tothe wave of unexplained aerial phenomena now recalled as the ‘Great FlyingSaucer Flap.’ Parsons opened a door and something flew in.” Indeed, this notionhas entered certain fringe areas of pop culture.Crowley sensationalizer F rancis King mentions that P arsons felt flying saucers “w ould pla y a part in conv erting the w orld to Crowleyanity.” When Camer onlater became obsessed with flying saucers she ne ver whisper ed a w ord about Parsons’ inter est. She believed saucers were not high-tech, but r ather a “restoration of the elemental powers.”An unconfirmed statement attributed to conspiriologist John Judge claimed thatParsons may have flown with the pilot K enneth Arnold, who in 1947 sa w severalsilver disks over Mt. R ainier in Washington State and coined the term “flyingsaucer” to describe them.Another Aerojet employee, Daniel F ry, saw a saucer in 195 0 and went on tobecome an activ e figur e in 195 0s contacteeism. Some wonderful footage of himin his final y ears is r ecorded in the film Farewell, Good Brothers. Stillanother occult-oriented employee in the aerospace engineering industry , theCalifornian Orfeo Angelucci, claimed to have been a contactee in the 195 0s.Other momentous events were attributed to Parsons. Referring to the date ofParsons’ death, Arthur Lyons said, “It was 13 years later, the period of humanmatur ation, that twins w ere born in San Francisco—the counter culture and theChur ch of Satan.” Ger ald Suster, in his biography of Israel Regardie, creditsParsons with helping birth the sixties.After his death, Camer on continued P arsons’ w ork—not the Babalon W orking,but that inv olving per sonal gr owth and e xploration. She moved to the desert,living in an American artists’ colony in northern Me xico (San Miguel deAllende), ne xt door to Da vid Siquieros and Max Ernst’ s wife Lenor aCarrington. Camer on and Soror Estai (Jane W olfe) struck up a v oluminous correspondence. Here’s hoping that this potentially fascinating communication willbe made public by the OTO or whomever has it.On December 15, 1952, Camer on wrote to Jane W olfe, “Se ven years ago, Jackbegan an oper ation which he r eferred to as the Babalon Work—and this set intomotion the second part of a great force which w as divided into thr ee. AleisterCr owley began the first, three years before I was born [a possible r eferenceto F rater Achad]. I ne ver knew the man, y et his desir e ga ve me birth. Hispaternity sings in m y v eins.” Camer on is sa ying that she is the third andfinal part of that “for ce”; she referred to her life as one of the “str angestand wildest v oyages into the unkno wn that has ever been told.”Cameron declared that Babalon actually came to e xist as her o wn self. This large claim comes despite the kno wn fact that P arsons believed Camer on was anelemental who he hoped w ould later giv e “birth” to Babalon. He w ould not have pr edicted Babalon’ s ph ysical manifestation to occur within se ven years,as he did in 1949 in The Manifesto of the AntiChrist, if she were already onearth. After the three-day working of March 1946, Parsons proclaimed, “Babalonis incarnate upon the earth today, awaiting the proper hour of Hermanifestation.” In 1949 Parsons revised this statement, perhaps anticipatingCameron’s return. The year 1949 must have been significant to Parsons—the bookthat purportedly came from Babalon is titled Liber 49.Parsons’ Songs for the Witch Woman is dedicated to Cameron, “in whom She isincarnate .” But in “The Star of Babalon” P arsons says that Her spirit iswithin all w omen who pr oclaim their equality to men. If this is indeed thecase , a billion women on planet Earth ar e now wearing Babalon’s tiara.In 1953, Cameron wrote:For some months now I have been aware of the heightening intensity of what Icall a thir d beam of hearing. I can describe it as the sound of a radio beamthat one picks up on shor twave. It is independent of my normal hearing—if Iclose my eyes it is not affected in any way. There are moments when it is sointense that I can actually tune it in—by turning my body. It seems to beheightened in power by the presence of some other humans . . . I have thefeeling that ther e is someone on the other end, or let me say that I have thefeeling that the beam transcends time and space and that I am hearing the soundof my transmitter echoed in incr edible places.While her auditory experiences were being inhumanly heightened, Cameron saw aflying saucer. In a letter to Jane Wolfe dated January 22, 1953, Camer onspeculated the UFO was the “w ar-engine” mentioned in The Book of the Law III:7-8 (“I will give you a war-engine. With it ye shall smite the peoples; and noneshall stand before you.”) Eight years earlier Crowley wondered if the atomicbomb constituted this engine.In another letter Cameron wrote about:[Mars], which I believe, is somehow my home. Earth will explode in a collisionwith the two Star Islands which ar e reported now moving towards each other inthe heavens [r eference uncertain]. And resulting ther efrom, my star , the great Seven-pointed Star of Babalon, shall be bor n in the heavens. [Mar ginaliascribed by Gerald Yorke in 1969 on a copy of Liber 49 states Camer on is “nuttyas can be.”]In order to contact her “Holy Guardian Angel,” Cameron began to illustrate Songsof the Witch Woman with her “desire.” We don’t have any record of Camer oncontacting her Guardian Angel, but soon w e will have Cameron’s illustrations ofParsons’ poem in print, or so it is said by their current owner, CarlAbrahamsson.The fateful y ear of 1953 also sa w the death of Mark M. Mills , Parsons’ formerassociate, in a helicopter crash at an Eniwetok atomic bomb test site. Millsholds some of the solid fuel patents with Parsons and also co-authored someonce-classified papers on solid fuel.Next year Cameron played both the Scarlet Woman and Kali, the Hindu goddess ofdestruction, in K enneth Anger’ s short film, Inauguration of the Pleasur eDome. Notorious for his under ground films and authorship of the HollywoodBabylon books, Anger is also known for rescuing Crowley’s paintings and ephemerain the Sicilian “Abbey of Thelema,” from which Crowley and company were tossedby Benito Mussolini in 1932. In a letter to W olfe, Cameron said that ritualsacted out in Anger’ s film helped bring do wn Babalon.The wido wed Camer on married a man named Sharif Kimmel. With some bikers onCatalina Island in 1955, she destroyed the black box from the Babalon Working.Cameron had a daughter, Crystal, as well as gr andchildren and great-grandchildren. Wilfr ed Smith, with whom she had lost contact, died in 1957.Jane W olfe died a fe w months later, in 1958.In 1957, a drawing by Cameron in Wallace Berman’s Semina magazine pr ompted a raid on the F erus Gallery b y the police and an obscenity trial, after whichBerman serv ed a few days in jail. Dean Stockwell paid his bail. The pictur eshowed a sun-headed man penetrating a w oman fr om the r ear. A photo of Cameron w as on the cover. Cameron the painter was also involved in the L.A. artscene of the 1960s, with Geor ge Herms, Bruce Connor and W allace Berman, andcontinued showing her work well into the 1980s.The American actors Dennis Hopper and Dean Stockw ell are said to have beenCameron’s roommates. In fact, Cameron appeared with Hopper in the 1961 CurtisHarrington horror film Night Tide, playing a Lo vecraftian “Deep One”—her fe wlines spok en in “R’ly ehian.” Harrington appeared in Inauguration of thePleasur e Dome as well; his film Wormwood Star is an impressionistic profile ofCameron.Ithell Colquhoun’ s The Sword of Wisdom , written in 1975, mentions an “ OTOLunar Lodge” with which Camer on was supposedly working around 1960, somewherein California. However, it does not seem to ha ve been charter ed, and those whokne w Camer on sa y there was no lodge at all.On Halloween 1968, JPL honored the 32nd anniversary of its nativity bydedicating a plaque behind its visitors’ center. During the dedication, JPL helda lar ge celebration, even going so far as to invite wives and e x-girlfriendswho had been pr esent during the tests. But they did not invite Ed Forman orRudolph Schott, both of whom were still alive and living in the area.Nonetheless, Forman donated an old rocket and papers he had saved from theoriginal tests, all of which have since been lost.In 1969, the London Sunday Times ran an article on L. R on Hubbard’s early involvement with magick. The Chur ch of Scientology protested, and in r eturn thepaper printed v erbatim the Church’s statement concerning Hubbard’s involvementwith Parsons.Hubbard br oke up black magic in America: Dr . Jack Parsons of Pasadena,California, was America’s Number One solid fuel r ocket expert. He was involvedwith the infamous English black magician Aleister Crowley who called himself‘The Beast 666.’ Crowley ran an organization called the Or der of TemplarsOrientalis over the world which had savage and bestial rites. Dr . Parsons washead of the American branch located at 100 Orange Gr ove Avenue, Pasadena,California. This was a huge old house which had paying guests who were theU.A.S. nuclear physicists working at Cal. tech. Certain agencies objected tonuclear physicists being housed under the same roof.L. Ron Hubbard was still an officer of the U.S. Navy [and] because he was wellknown as a writer and philosopher and had friends among the physicists, he wassent in to handle the situation. He went to live at the house and investigatedthe black magic rites and the general situation and found them ver y bad.Parsons wrote to Cr owley in England about Hubbar d. Cr owley “the Beast 666”evidently detected an enemy and war ned Parsons. This was all proven by thecorrespondence unearthed by the [London] Sunday Times. Hubbard’s mission wassuccessful far beyond anyone’s expectations. The house was torn down. Hubbardrescued a girl they wer e using. The black magic gr oup was dispersed and neverr ecovered. The physicists included many of the sixty-four top U.S. scientistswho were later declared insecure and dismissed from government service with somuch publicity.47 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_ftn_r1.html#FTN-47]Despite the vilification and br ouhaha, in 1972 the International AstronomicalUnion in France honored Parsons by naming a crater on the moon after him.“Parsons Crater” is at 370 N latitude, 1710 W longitude, and, appropriatelyenough, on the dark side of the moon. Due to the Ranger survey, the first tophotograph the dark side and reveal hundreds of new craters in need of names,NASA turned to its own past to provide them. Parsons was the only GALCITscientist to earn this honor, in which Frank Malina, now living in France, mayhave had a hand.Parsons’ buddy, Ed F orman, died in 1973 of heart tr ouble while employed byLockheed in El Segundo. Despite his lifelong closeness with Parsons, Formannever joined the OTO. (Parsons’ mother, Ruth, also worked at Lockheed during thew ar.)It is evident that Parsons was considered an important if dangerous figure bythe authorities. His FBI file, which was requested prior to the Freedom ofInformation Act as part of a JPL history project, is heavily censored. AlthoughFOIA rules have since changed, when one requests the file one normally gets aphotocop y of the file that has already been processed. There have been noupdates, simply because the FBI hasn’t noticed or doesn’t want to bother withit.Among the many reasons Parsons was investigated was not only the “black magic”but also his association with communist s ympathizers. Fellow GALCIT groupmember, Frank Malina, whose efforts served the U.S. quite effectively, was alsoa victim of the Communist witchhunts. After the w ar, Malina had become head ofthe scientific research division of UNESCO in France, a post he held until hispolitical beliefs and longstanding member ship in the Communist P arty werediscovered. He r esigned and turned to a successful car eer in “kinetic art.”Several of his pieces are still on display in England, and the art/sciencejournal he founded, Leonardo, is still published b y MIT. Malina died in Francein 1981.It may have been Malina who first introduced the late John Parsons to theUFO-researcher and debunker, Jacques Vallee, who was the role model for the French scientist in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Vallee suggests that JPLwould deny Parsons ever existed; but, as e videnced by a memorial plaque on JPLgrounds (and numerous conversations with the staff of JPL) the opposite isactually the case.After the w ar, group leader and r ocket scientist v on Kármán w as invited toGermany to inspect various Nazi research installations like the one at Peenemünde. This visit occurred at the invitation of Hap Arnold and his other oldfriends in Washington. Von Kármán’s autobiography, The Wind and Beyond, containspictures from his trip to Germany, including one shot of him interrogating aGerman scientist. As pr eviously noted, v on Kármán w orked in German y duringthe decade follo wing World War I. After W orld War II, he w as instrumental inrecruiting Nazi scientists to the United States. Declassified documents r eferto this effort as “Oper ation P aperclip.” Some of Parsons’ letter s to Camer onar e fr om Alabama, wher e P aperclip rocket scientist Wernher von Braun was aprisoner of w ar, and it is possible the tw o had met. V on Kármán spent the next two decades engaged in various aeronautics research projects and died in1963, a giant among men.GALCIT member and alleged spy Hsue-shen Tsien had an interesting if troubledlife after the war ended. Evidently he was accused of being a Communist simplybecause he was Chinese, as, years later, Malina’s widow told an interviewer, “Wenever saw him at any of the cell meetings.” This incident embarr assed Tsien somuch he decided to r eturn to China—something he thought he’d never do. However,immigration stopped him at the docks and detained him for fiv e years, by whichtime, the authorities figur ed, an ything he kne w w ould be obsolete . Thenthey deported him, and subsequently he singlehandedly built the Chinese missilepr ogram from scratch using what he had learned at GALCIT. Tsien’s fascinatinglife is r ecounted in Iris Chang’ s biography, Thread of the Silk Worm.In 1989, a collection of Parsons’ unpublished essays, Freedom Is A Two-EdgedSword, appeared and renewed interest in the man, which has sur ged with the advent of the W orld Wide W eb. The book includes Parsons’ commentary on the “RedScare.” Much of the other material reproduced in Freedom Is A Two-Edged Sworddeals with two of Parsons’ post- OTO projects: The Gnosis and The Witchcr aft.The former was an attempt to set up a regular form of worship for Parsons andfor whomever would follow.Parsons christianized his Gnosis by having Sophia, the incarnation of wisdom,play the role of the daughter of God, equating her with the Holy Ghost. InParsons’ version, Sophia’s union with Christ was equal to God. In “tr aditional”Gnosticism, Sophia w as usually the mother of God, and Christ the savior ofboth. Only in Parsons’ work do we find the alternative formula, to which endParsons wrote “On Magick,” “The Gnostic Creed,” and “The Gnostic Doctrine .”Parsons’ other project was The Witchcr aft, a course on magick for the layman.Surviving documents include “Basic Magick: Fundamental Theory and Practice,”“Manifesto of The Witchcraft,” and a few chapters of a book called The Cup, theSword and the Crux Ansata. Parsons wrote the manifesto June 15, 195 0, but hestill thought enough of Babalon to note this as the y ear 4000. However, thedate is inconsistent with pr evious Babalon-influenced dates . In 1946, Hubbar dpr oclaimed the year Babalon 4063, and in 1949 Parsons dated The Book ofAntiChrist 4066. The year 4000 may indicate a change of his numbering system; itis not a misprint.Parsons’ purpose in creating these texts was clear: To Cameron he wrote,“Simplicity has been the k ey to victory in all the idea w ars and, at present,Magick does not have it. There is the skeleton in the Rights of Man [Crowley’sLiber OZ ], and the coverings in the main literature. But the true body hasnever been shown forth.”In addition, short outlines on “General Field Theory” that Parsons leftunfinished could almost be taken as precursors of the late Rupert Sheldrake’s“morphogenetic field theory .” Notes on W agner’s The Ring take us to the finalchapter of Freedom: it is “The Star of Babalon,” already mentioned. Part ofParsons’ The Book of Babalon , this chapter consists of instructions receivedfrom Babalon herself for the Magical Child. Much like the magical letter in thebeautiful gnostic “Hymn of the P earl,” these instructions w ould serve toeffect an anamnesis (awakening) on the child’s part, to further her mission onEarth. This text serves as further e vidence that it w as not Camer on who wasto become Babalon, but someone as y et unknown.As noted, Camer on occasionally sho wed her art, but she ne ver sold it. Infact, much of her early w ork she destr oyed. The r est remains in privatecollections, although several showings have been held, such as at the LosAngeles Municipal Art Gallery and at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in1989. Camer on w as included posthumously in the “Beat Gener ation” sho w at theWhitne y Museum in Ne w York in late 1995. Near the end of her life sherequested permission fr om JPL to giv e her gr andson Silv er a tour , wantinghim to see wher e his “gr andfather” had worked, a request that was granted.Cameron died of cancer on July 24, 1995, aged 73.Having reviewed the life of John P arsons in more depth than most writers, I have come to the conclusion that he has been misunderstood—even misrepresented.Historians of rocketry and the space program seem to have underestimated hiscontributions to the field, while writers on the occult have romanticized him assome sort of great sorcerer. Without his contributions to both solid and liquidfuels , the American space program would not be wher e it is today. In less thanfive years, Parsons accomplished what Robert Goddard could not do in a lifetime.The list concerning the top leader s in the world of rocketry contained in v onKármán’s 1958 letter, written the same y ear as the solid-fueled Explorer I, wasself-aggrandizing, as v on Kármán himself admitted. To wit, Malina had writtento v on Kármán concerning opinion on who were the top 10 Americans who hadcontributed to the program. “Starting, of course, with ourselves, the list is ofthe follo wing,” von Kármán replied. Parsons name was at the top.While one cannot tak e von Kármán’s name off the top of that list, there isjustification for placing P arsons’ name abo ve Malina’ s, as Parsons is theindividual who per severed in the face of r epeated failures, and Parsons andthe others funded their own research until someone (Hap Arnold) finally tooknotice . Furthermore, Parsons was the one in the field blo wing up rocket afterrocket until he found just the right combination that w orked. V on Kármánencour aged him, but Parsons did the difficult and e xtremely hazar dous w ork.Ev erything today in the field of solid fuel r ockets is essentially P arsons’work, if slightly modified. Obviously , it cannot be said that P arsonssinglehandedly won the war, but his JATOs were deployed in several areas for itslast thr ee y ears. In addition, the global compan y A erojet w as founded uponParsons’ innovations with solid fuels, and nothing else.It is lik ely that P arsons’ underestimation had little to do with his occultactivities, which seem to ha ve been tolerated as one of man y eccentricitiesassociated with his brand of genius. Amo Smith had his pith helmet, Malina was acommunist, and v on Kármán talked about the golem—this w as the normal state ofaffair s at Caltech. In r eality, Parsons is forgotten because he was not a partof Caltech pr oper, not a “scientist” in the stuffy sense of the word. He didnot hold a degree from an accredited university.One of the biggest questions r emaining is wh y P arsons and Forman abandoned rockets altogether at the end of the w ar. Their early work was diverted intoother dir ections as the w ar demanded new technologies, yet it was not they butMalina who took up pur e rocketry after the w ar ended. Was Parsons’ work withthe OTO more important now than his profession? Did Aerojet make him sign anon-competition agr eement? W as he r esting on his laur els when he should havebeen pursuing other fields of research? Or was there simply no funding for suchthings an ymore? Hopefully, and likely, considering Parsons’ mentality, hisoriginal inter est was mor e than a matter of mer e profit, but what had startedas a passion got lost in the distraction of war and personal upheavals.Today, P arsons’ inspir ed ingr edient for r ocket fuel, ammonium perchlorate,is causing its o wn pr oblems. A ccording to Jonathan Parfrey, president ofPhysicians for Social Responsibility, toxicological studies by the EP A showthat perchlorate is an endocrine disruptor which also harms fetal development.Perchlorate has also been linked to conditions like aplastic anemia and hypothyroidism. After having leached into gr oundwater at A erojet’s Sacr amento,San Gabriel and Chino Hills facilities , multimillion-dollar per chloratecleanups ar e currently underway.In contradistinction to the under estimation in the field of r ocket science andthe aerospace industry, Parsons’ accomplishments in the arcane sciences havebeen highly overrated and grossly exaggerated. As a magician he was essentiallya failure. As a Thelemite he learned the har d w ay what w as r equired. He loved Cr owley’s “La w” but couldn’t adhere to it—though he tried harder thanmost. He violated the rules, undertook unauthorized and unorthodo x magical operations, and claimed the gr ade of Magister Templi without first completing allthe gr ades below it. He couldn’t handle w orking under authority—his ego w astoo big. His r ecord of failur e is v aluable in that regard. He w as a gr eatpr omulgator of thelemic ideals in his essays, but as an idealist his elitismruined his w ork. Indeed, some would say he was guilty of hubris, which the godsalways punish.In his (short) per sonal and business liv es P arsons also scor ed poorly. Hisromantic naiveté led him to trust those whom he should not have trusted. Hechose some v ery good friends but also some very bad associates. He wiselyjoined in on the founding of A erojet, only foolishly to sell out a fe w shortyears later, which, admittedly, even the great man v on Kármán did. Ho wever,there is little e xcuse but naiv eté for what P arsons did with the mone y he received from that sale. In addition, his mix-up with the Israelis was perhaps asimple mistake in judgement, but one that he could ha ve avoided quite easily.He admired them but misjudged U.S. policy.The whole matter of his death has also been gr eatly overemphasized. Suicide issimply not tenable, and the only clear possible murder suspect is K ynette, thecr ooked cop, although ther e ma y be others. A U.S. scientist who attempted topass go vernment “secrets” onto the Isr aelis, and who w as loading e xplosivechemicals on a truck bound for Mexico and then Israel, may have won himself afew anonymous enemies.Despite these suspicions and the fact that P arsons was an e xperienced handlerof explosives, his death may truly have been accidental. As noted, P arsons sweated pr ofusely, as tw o separ ate acquaintances have testified, one of themalso pointing out ho w hot it was that June day in 1952. Even a safety-consciousexpert could let a tin can slip out of a sw eaty hand. The hole in the floor,the shrapnel stuck in lo w places, the loss of the right arm, all point to adropped container . And it is questionable just ho w “safety-conscious” was aman who stored all sorts of dangerous explosives in his kitchen, on the backporch, in unlicensed labs in residential areas.The only evidence not easily e xplained is the detectiv e’s original commentthat the e xplosion occurred behind Parsons, and the fact that the trash can wasfull of explosive substances which should not have been ther e. Mur der cannotbe ruled out, but a sad accident seems more likely. Had the notorious LosAngeles police investigated the scene, w e could consider a co verup. But it was the Pasadena police, assisted b y Arm y Or dnance. If someone had w anted himdead, a car bomb would have been easy enough to rig. But fulminate of mercury isnot stable enough for a mur der scheme that had to be clever enough to fool anexpert. Had it been mixed ahead of time and planted in his lab, Parsons wouldhave noticed it right away. It’s true that fulminate of mercury becomes moredangerous as it dries, but as soon as P arsons had seen a can of dried fulminateof mer cury, he would’ve known someone had planted it ther e. Of cour se, unlessit was beneath the floorboard, as Cameron claimed to have discovered, andcordite with a fulminate of mercury fuse may be a possibility.Based on the evidence—admittedly obscured by 40 years of time—it seems that JohnP arsons’ death w as accidental. Of cour se, there remain the accusatory remarksof Cameron—not the best witness for later events, but she was the closest personto Parsons at the time of his death. F urthermore, the disco very of additionale vidence might lead one to believe that it was murder.As a boy, I read an odd little science fiction story, one that Parsons nevercould have seen, as it was published in 1955, three years after his death. Thetitle w as “End as a W orld,” and the author w as F.L. Wallace. I found thestory in an anthology edited b y H.L. Gold entitled The Third Galaxy R eader,for which I paid a dime at a gar age sale. “End as a World” wasn’t the beststory in the book, but it w asn’t the worst, either. It was a different kind ofstory. Its surprise ending stuck in my memory for a long time.The story started with newspaper and radio accounts of the end of the world.Day-to-day activity stopped as people look up and wait for the end. Suddenly aloud noise was heard, and a bright flash of light was seen overhead. It was notwhat was expected, i.e., the explosion of the planet: It was the first rocketship. It was indeed the end of the world, the story concluded, but the beginningof the univ erse.John P arsons, self-pr ofessed Antichrist, ma y not ha ve br ought about the endof the w orld, but through his contributions to science he played a part inbringing about the beginning of the univ erse.031 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_031_r1.gif]"},{"pageContent":"AfterwordHelen Parsons Smith died July 27, 2003 at Tahoe Forest Hospital, close to herlongtime home in King’ s Beach, CA. She w as survived by her son K wen Smith andhis wife , along with their two children and their two grandchildren. Helen wasthe oldest OTO initiate at the time of her death, the numer ologicallysignificant age of 93. Her obituary sa ys that for a long period in her life“she may well have been the only regularly active priestess in the world whocarried forth the celebr ation of the mass of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica.” Perher wishes there was no funeral; she enjoyed her privacy to the end.One other notable event took place since this book w as first published four years ago. I w as able to unco ver the inspir ation for Parsons’ Black Pilgrimage, which I discussed in chapter 1 0. The source was M.R. James’ short story“Count Magnus ,” published in 1904. It has been reprinted in several places; mycopy is in Collected Ghost Stories , published b y W ordsworth Editions , Ltd.in 1992. I believe the story may also be found online .The fictional Count Magnus De la Gardie was a late 16th-century/ early17th-century mage residing in a huge manor in Vestergothland, Sweden. He seemsto have been named for a real Count Magnus who lived in the same ar ea from 1622to 1686, but the tw o have nothing else in common. The center of the story isthe m ysterious Black Pilgrimage he w as said to ha ve undertak en, what form itactually took, and what he brought back from it. The nature of the pilgrimageitself is never discovered, though the thing he brought back is hinted at. Itseems to ha ve been some sort of supernatur al beast, a demon or familiar spiritthat protected Magnus even in death.James does specify the destination of the Black Pilgrimage. It was Chorazin inPalestine (now in Israel), the city which Jesus cursed, the city which laterlegends said w ould birth the Antichrist, the city which Parsons also named asthe destination of his pilgrimage . Its unique black ruins still stand; the yare black because they are made of the local basalt. Of all of Chor azin’sruins, the best-kno wn is the unfinished synagogue. James has Magnus write ofhis Liber nigr ae peregrinationis, “If any man desires to obtain a long life, ifhe would obtain a faithful messenger and see the blood of his enemies , it isnecessary that he should first go into the city of Chor azin, and there salutethe prince [of the air].” The story doesn’t specify ho w long Magnus lived, butbased on internal evidence one may deduce it was around 120 years. The storydoes mak e clear that Magnus obtained his faithful messenger, and did haveoccasion to see the blood of his enemies.On F ebruary 28, 1946 P arsons wr ote Liber 49 , a book fr om Babalon whose 58thv erse sa ys, “Thou shalt mak e the Black Pilgrimage.” No further details w eregiven until P arsons wrote The Book of AntiChrist a few years later. In The Bookof AntiChrist , the first section of which is entitled “The Black Pilgrimage ,”Parsons wrote that he began his pilgrimage in November of 1949, in response to adream he says came from Babalon. He describes the pilgrimage as an astralworking conducted in his temple.Parsons wrote, “And I went into the sunset with Her sign, and into the nightpast accursed and desolate places and cyclopean ruins, and so came at last tothe City of Chor azin. And ther e a gr eat tower of Black Basalt was raised,that was part of a castle whose further battlements reeled over the gulf of thestar s. And upon the to wer was this sign [a circle inscribed with an invertedtriangle]. And one heavily robed and v eiled showed me the sign, and told me tolook, and behold, I sa w flash below me four past lives wherein I had failed inmy object.” P arsons goes on to name these past liv es; I ha ve described eachof them in detail in chapter 1 0. After this he writes , “And ther eafter I w astak en within and saluted the Prince of that place . . .,” echoing Magnus’instructions to go into the city and salute the Prince of the Air. Judging fromhints in Parsons’ letters to Karl Germer in 1949 and later, his purpose was notlong life, a faithful messenger, nor to see the blood of his enemies; it wasalways the furtherance of Thelema. (But if the further ance of Thelemanecessitated an y of these , P arsons sur ely hoped the y w ould follo w. Hespecifically names Christianity—all of Christianity—as the enem y of mankind.)The pilgrimage itself is not mentioned again in his surviving writings.In Ghosts & Scholars issue 26, Jamesian scholars Rosemary Pardoe and JaneNicholls discuss the possible literary and historical sources for James’ BlackPilgrimage . The y document James’ kno wledge of the apocryphal Revelation ofthe Pseudo-Methodius (fourth century) in which Chor azin is fir st mentioned asthe birthplace of the Antichrist, as well as his familiarity with W. Bousset’sDer Antichrist, published in 1895, which also documents the legend. James’favorite story b y the early Irish horr or writer Sheridan Le F anu w as “TheFamiliar,” in which the phr ase “the prince of the po wers of the air” occurs.The phr ase originates with St. P aul, who r efers to Satan in this manner inEphesians 2:2, and James w ould have known about its Biblical origin as well.Pardoe and Nicholls also document James’ familiarity with John Dee. James editeda list of Dee’ s manuscripts in 1921, compiling his list from several others andfrom original sources. One of the titles on Elias Ashmole’s list was LiberPeregrinationis Primae (The Book of the First Pilgrimage ). The author sspeculate that this title influenced James’ Liber nigr ae per egrinationis (TheBook of the Black Pilgrimage). This may be, but it only takes a basic knowledgeof Latin to translate such a title. (Dee’s book describes magical conversationsrecorded during a trip to Kr akow in 1583.)Pardoe and Nicholls e xcel when the y sho w just ho w P arsons could’veencounter ed James’ story—and it occurr ed only months before he received hisinstruction to go on the Black Pilgrimage from Babalon. Samuel D. Russell wrotean essay on James which appeared in the Fall 1945 issue of The Acolyte (afanzine). Russell and Parsons both frequented the Los Angeles Science FantasySociety (LASFS), so it’s fairly certain that James was discussed there. Parsonsreceived his instructions on February 28, 1946, which seems to imply he had beenreading James recently.Unless further e vidence appear s, it appear s that M.R. James invented theBlack Pilgrimage as a liter ary device based on legends of Chor azin, r atherthan its being a genuine magical tr adition. Parsons took inspiration for amagical working based on this concept, just as he had tak en inspir ation fr omother fantas y w orks (for instance, his fa vorite no vel w as Jack Williamson’s supernatur al thriller Darker Than Y ou Think , discussed in chapter 4.) Recall Crowley’s letter criticizing Parsons for taking such a lo w form ofliterature so seriously. Despite the criticism, Parsons continued to take hisinspiration wherever he would find it.James doesn’t tell us how Count Magnus died; his death is a mystery, as isParsons’. In contrast, however, Magnus had something that Parsons didn’t. He hadhis “faithful messenger ,” the thing that he brought back from his BlackPilgrimage, the thing that protected his estate e ven after his death. P arsonsdoesn’t seem to ha ve brought anything back from his pilgrimage to protect him,and his messengers were few. The foremost of these were Cameron and Karl Germer,who preserved his writings and his message for futur e gener ations. They aregone now, and with the passing of Helen the story has come to a close.

Recor ded onDecember 20, 1937, it was per formed by the Boston Symphony Or chestra, andconducted by Ser ge Koussevitzsky, while Jascha Heifetz played violin. Prokofiev(1891-1953) was still alive at the time. Lasting just over 34 minutes, it is ahaunting r ecording, though sentimental in places. It is unclear whether theScribe restarted the record when it finished, or if the participants justallowed it to r un until it stopped. The original was a 78-rpm phonographrecord, and its CD is available on Biddulph from England. It is also availableas item number 9167 in the Pearl-Koch catalog, entitled Jacha (sic) HeifetzConcerto Recordings Vol. IIBrahms et al., a version released October 13, 1995 aspar t of a two-disc set.27 [bano_9781932595666_oeb_c07_r1.html#Ref-FTN-27]This occurrence is curiously similar to the nine r egular knocks that WhitleyStrieber felt confirmed the existence of his other worldly Visitors in his“non-fiction” book Communion.

Recorded April 20, 1929 with the Philadelphia Or chestraand released on 78, it lasts 18 minutes, which means Parsons let it r un outduring the invocation, or else the Scribe had to restart it several times.
