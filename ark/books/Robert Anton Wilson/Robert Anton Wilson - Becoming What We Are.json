And in sci ence, the names of Einstein, Dir ac, the Cur ies, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schroe dinger, John Be ll etc. live on beca use non e of them took Newton as Holy Gospel: the y all made unique an d unpredictable innovations in bas ic theory.

Buckminster Fuller did not copy the cubic al form of previous arch itects, but invented the geodes ic dome; at last count, over 3OO ,OOO of his buildings existed, making h im the most visibly successful arc hitect in history. Steve Wozniak did n ot copy the co mputers of his day, but invented one that even an \"b loody eejit\" [lik e me] cou ld use [and even enjoy!] Bill Gates create d new kinds of soft ware. Etc. We all need constant reiterati on of these truism because we live in a world wh ere a multitude of very powerful forces have worked up on us, from birth throug h schoo l to work, attempting to sup press our individuality, our creativit y and, above all, our cur iosity -- in short, to destro y everything that encoura ges us to think for ourselves. Our parents w anted us to act like the other ch ildren in our ne ighborhood; they emphatically did not w ant a boy or girl who seemed \"weird or \"d ifferent\" or [Heaven forefend] \"too damned clever by far.\" Then w e enter grade scho ol, a fate worse than Death an d Hell combined. Whether w e land in a pu blic sch ool or a private religious schoo l, we learn two basic lessons: 1] There exists one correct answ er for every questio n; and 2] education cons ists of me morizing the one corr ect answer and re gurgitati ng it on an \"exa mination.\" The sam e tactics continu e through hi gh schoo l and, except in a few scienc es, even to the universit y. All throu gh this \"ed ucation \" we find o urselves bombarded by organized rel igion.

After 18-to-3 0+ years of all this, we enter the job m arket, and le arn to become, or try to beco me, al most deaf, dumb and blind. We must always tell our \"su periors\" what they want to hear , what suits their prej udices and/or their w ishful fantasies. If we notice something they don't want to know about, we learn to keep our mouths shut.

Half of the people you meet do indeed see m dumber than a box of rocks; but they did not start out that way. Parents, peers, schoo ls, churches, advertisers and jobs made them that way. Every baby at birth has a re lentless ly curious and experim ental temperament. It takes the first third of our lives to destro y that curiosit y and experi mentalism; but in most cases, we become placid parts of a docile h erd. This hu man herd all started o ut as potenti al gen iuses, before the tacit conspir acy of social co nformity blighted their brai ns.
