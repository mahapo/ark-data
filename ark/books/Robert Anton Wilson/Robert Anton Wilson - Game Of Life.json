This concept is easilydemonstrated in the development of the human embryo (which at various times hasgills and a tail), but seldom extended to the whole lifespan of the individualas here. You will find in The Game of Life, as in Intelligence Agents andExo-Psychology, not only the idea that evolution is proceeding intopre-programmed post-human stages which will carry us off this planet, but alsothat some human beings are (have always been) literally ahead of their times inhaving activated what Dr. Leary calls “circuits” of their nervous systems yearsor even centuries ahead of general human development. Recapitulation is thusonly a part of a genetic process which throws (“castes”) out futique as well asantique forms. This would explain the development pre-scientifically of conceptsnow being explored in such modern sciences as human ethology (sociobiology) andquantum physics.Imprinting—The idea that during pre-programmed periods in an individual’sdevelopment the organism is open to fixating on certain behaviors is stillmainly confined to animal psychology (Konrad Lorenz). That this might extend tohuman behaviors is only now being investigated by such researchers as Dr.Marshall Klaus of Cleveland and psychologist Donna Kontos of Toronto, who appearto be amassing evidence that human infants (and mothers) experience a period ofheightened suggestibility following birth in which both baby and mother willimprint each other as love/care objects—or in which both gain the impression,through hospital procedures, that the other is not really there for hir.If you put these two ideas together, you can see the possibility that, from agenetic point of view, a whole species might experience periods of greatsuggestibility during which it might make great leaps ahead inintelligence—learn to make fire, develop a planetary perspective.The timeliness of this book is in the context of the dominance in SouthernCalifornia—the last terrestrial frontier—of what Dr. Leary once called“suntanned, graceful, sensory-equipped, yogic” Fifth Circuit (see Part III)individuals. As a result of his insight that this flowering of beauty andself-actualization is not the end of human evolution (nor a mere sign of Westerndecadence), Dr. Leary points to the next step—a fusion of human energies to liftlife off the planet and thus open up the ecological and economic system of Sol3. The human species is accelerating to escape velocity.What kind of transmission would be most helpful in facilitating the explorationof human communities tolerant and knowledgeable enough to withstand theacceleration/radiation of post-terrestrial individuals? One answer lies in humanethology: in the exo-psychological concept of seasonally varied geneticdifferences in human nervous systems. Exo-Psychology’s success in prediction isbacked by Dr. Leary’s career of anticipating the movements of humanconsciousness.And your success in surfing the evolutionary waves to come may be dependent onthe extent to which you understand the concepts presented here. As forcomprehending Dr. Leary’s work, I’ll give you George Koopman’s advice: read eachsentence as though it were a paragraph.Now: surf’s up! (Serfs are down!

Again weshall make the comparison with atomic physics. Democritus pointed out over twothousand years ago that all matter was composed of atoms, but in spite of thisclue, Newtonian physics, which is neuro-muscular, disregarded the elementalenergy-structure of matter. Assume that the larval symbolic mind, using thelower circuits of the nervous system, has, in exactly the same fashion, producedmagnificent and complex systems of muscular thought in ignorance of theelectrochemical neural structure of consciousness and intelligence.The Einsteinian formulae demonstrated the metamorphic relativity of energy, timeand matter and made possible the transmutation of elements and the release ofenormous energy by means of fission and fusion.Symbols are Newtonian representations of reality created by laryngeal muscles(words) or by manual muscles (artifacts).Neurologic studies the fluid, metamorphic, transmutational relativity ofevolution, as experienced by those who have activated post-terrestrial braincircuits which fission and fuse symbols in new combinations."},{"pageContent":"EVERYTHING EXISTS AS A NERVOUS SYSTEMHuman beings are robots operationally programmed by (1) neurogenic templates,(2) neural imprints, (3) social conditioning [part0005.html#toc_ch2]images/img-16-1.png [../images/00013.jpeg]Who ME??

[part0005.html#toc_ch3]Exo-psychology suggests that a rudimentary understanding of the operation andmanagement of the nervous system would clarify and enlighten every aspect oflife—allowing human beings to decode the answers to the basic genetic questions:why are we here?where are we going?how do we get there?It is time we had some answers to these riddles beyond the pompous (andunproven) dogmas of larval religion, the bland no-answer of Zen, or the humorousresignation of the wit who wrote:We’re here because we’re herebecause we’re herebecause we’re hereimages/img-18-1.png [../images/00017.gif]This is Genetic Elitism!And our answer must begin with examination of the instrument of investigationitself: the human brain.Let us review our neurological ABC’s. Nobody but the most naive would claim thata dog perceives the same room as his human companion. We know, for instance,that human beings differ from other animals in using vision more than smell toorient themselves; we use the vision circuitry of our brain as much as thosequite distant relatives, the birds. The dog (like the wolf, tiger, hamster andother mammals) marks his territory by smell, identifies friend and foe by odor,lives in what would appear to us an incredibly rich and subtle olfactorycontinuum, and sees perhaps only two basic colors to our eight. The dog’snervous system, lacking the symbolic-linguistic circuits of ours, codes thesemostly-olfactory signals into pre-linguistic categories, mostly keyed toimmediate glandular-emotional response.The mosquito flying in through the window has a very different brain circuitryand realizes a room different from that of either dog or WoMan.Finally, since no two humans are alike in 1. genetic wiring 2. neural imprinting3. social conditioning and learning, no two people ever “see” (smell, hear,taste, integrate) the “same” room. The Sufi parable of the twenty-four blind menand the elephant remains the paradigm of neurologic, reminding us that humanbeings come in very different models, wired with different brain circuits.Now, this is more or less understood in optics, in general neurology, insemantics, etc., but we still tend to attribute a kind of universal reality toour very unique neural abstractions.images/img-19-1.png [../images/00018.jpeg]In the terminology of Carlos Castaneda’s books on Mexican shamanism, we liveinside a “bubble” of concretized, extrojected abstractions and we mistake the“bubble” for consensual reality. Or, as Alan Watts said so charmingly, we are aweird bunch who can’t tell the menu from the meal.We do not regard our impressions as “part of ME,” my creation, mylogical-artistic map of the world with my thoughts and aesthetics woven into itsvery fabric. We can be shown, with optical and neurological diagrams, how thesignal from the space-time event travels to our receptors and is transmittedthrough the unique circuitry of our nervous system, but we still retain theparadoxical feeling that the final sensory abstraction (our “perception” of theevent) is more “real” than the energy-signals themselves.We fear that accepting the proven scientific facts and redefining our concept ofreality will plunge us into subjectivism, hippie Zen, agnosticism, loss of allstandards, moral impotence, confusion. Or, if we can conquer this fear (whichbasically exists in confronting every new discovery) we still can’t see the needfor re-programming our circuits to remember, moment-by-moment, what is actuallyhappening as we receive, code, classify, integrate energy signals. Thus, wevoluntarily retain the lazy, inaccurate, unscientific assumption that it isreasonable and safe to continue acting as if the world were no more than ourprivate map of it.images/img-19-2.png [../images/00019.gif]I hope Humans are ready for this!Each human dyad is Robinson Crusoeand Friday, two alien intelligences,groping for signals that can transmitexperiences across space-time.In a deeper sense, each DNA-robot abstracts via its unique nervous system aseemingly complete model of the universe. This model seems complete in that itis “whole,” integrated, harmonious, includes all data consciously apprehended bythe organism, meshes with continuous sensory input (or is rapidly revised), andis regarded as “real.” The habit of treating this private model as if it werethe universe is called identification by both Korzybski, the semanticist, andGurdjieff, the “mystic.” This habit produces reality dogmatism, realityintolerance, reality fanaticism.Exo-psychology assumes, in evolutionary sequence, 8 circuits or 24 stages ofneural integration. At each stage, the nervous system responds to differentsignals, recognizes different levels of energy and meaning, integrates a newmodel of the universe. On the primitive levels of development there is aninescapable tendency to make the identification: my model = universe. Theprimitive nervous system has no way of becoming “conscious of abstracting,” nomethod of learning that the private model is not the universe. At later stagesof neural evolution, this tendency still has to be battled, but is no longerirresistible. Yogis, shamans, alchemists, using primitive but directreimprinting techniques, and modern scientists working in such diverse fields asoptics, neurology, neurologic, semantics, relativity physics, bio-psychology,psychology, etc., can gradually become conscious of their own abstractingprocesses, recognize the relativity of nervous systems, and begin consciouslyevolving toward ever-higher modes of knowing and being.We may write the equationsRl = F (Stage 1)R2 = F (Stage 2) etc.R24 = F (Stage 24)images/img-21-1.png [../images/00020.jpeg]where R1, R2, etc., to R24 are the various Reality Models (or “maps” as thesemanticists say), F as usual means “a function of” and Stage 1, Stage 2...toStage 24 are the evolutionary stages of the neurogenetic array. Eachevolutionary stage produces its own functional model of the universe, accordingto the signals received, integrated and transmitted by the circuitry. Slot 3(Taurus) cannot “share” the universe of Slot 12 (Aquarius) because the Caste 3brain is wired differently from the Caste 14.This theory is entirely general. My Stage 10 is never your Stage 10. We alwayshave differences in genetic templating, neural imprinting, social conditioningand life experience. Learning, then, is endless. Each new nervous system withwhich we interlock, however briefly, can be a whole new learning-teachingexperience. Each dyad is Robinson Crusoe and Friday, two Alien Intelligences,groping for signals that can transmit experiences across space-time.We search everywhere for it and all the while it is carrying us about. It is ournervous system.images/img-22-1.png [../images/00021.jpeg]This is the point of the old Sufi parable in which Mullah Nasrudin, the sage whoalways pretends to be a clown, races through town on his donkey. “Where are yougoing in such a hurry, Nasrudin?” The neighbors ask.“I’m looking for my donkey!” He replies.Like other Sufi jokes, this is intended to amuse the general population, receivewide circulation among both adults and children, and be in the memory-banks ofany robot who turns up at a Sufi school seeking re-wiring. At some point in Hirtraining, then, the candidate will be told the joke-within-the-joke. The donkeyrepresents the “magical technique,” the “hidden knowledge,” the “alchemicalElixir,” the great “Philosopher’s Stone” which gives wisdom to the adept. Wesearch everywhere for It and all the while It is carrying us about.

Taxonomy always precedes evolutionaryrevelation at any level of energy. Thus we see how the conscientious speciesclassification of Linnaeus provided Darwin with the raw material from which hededuced the evolution of genetic families interacting with each other.A great achievement of the mid 19th century was the classification of chemicalelements by Mendeleyev. Like Linnaeus, Dimitri discovered that each element is aspecies grouped into families, division and classes. Each element being definedby its interpersonal interactions with members of other species.The taxonomy of Mendeleyev made possible the insights of the 20th centuryphysicists that chemical elements evolve and mutate.We now understand that each of the natural and each of the experimentallyproduced elements is a species and belongs to a family. The octave arrangementof the Periodic Table goes from the down-to-earth metals up to the “noble”gases.When Mendeleyev began his task of classification 65 elements had been defined.But the elements were a jungle of disorder and no taxonomic principles existedfor relating and predicting elements and their familial interaction. Chemistrywas in the position of biology before Linnaeus and psychology today. What wasneeded was an ordering principle, a taxonomic system which would logically andempirically relate the bewildering diversity.The Periodic Table of Elements which is known to every school child is theresult of Mendeleyev’s intuitive genius. The realization that this periodicordering of elements in terms of their atomic weight is also a description ofthe evolution of matter and corresponds in an uncanny way with the periodicrhythm of the evolution of biological species.The central thesis of this manual is that the classic alchemical-philosophicsystems (including I Ching, Tarot, Zodiac, Chess) are expressions of theordinal-sequence of energy-matter as codified in the Periodic Table of Elements."},{"pageContent":"MENDELEYEV GIVES KEY TO LIFE PLANimages/img-26-1.png [../images/00025.jpeg]Dmitri all smiles as he receives prize for neuro-cryptographyA grab-bag of unrelated facts does not define a science any more than a heap ofbricks and lumber constitutes a house. It is the artistic achievement of thescientific de-coder to sift the facts into coherence, order, structure; just asit is the scientific discipline of the architect to let his building materialsfuse into a dwelling machine. Many theoretical structures are possible, but onlya few mesh with the actual energy-structure of the universe.

Decoding the grand strategy of the Gameof Life.* [part0011_split_000.html#ch4_nts1]Actually, the basic structure of thePeriodic Table was announced by the English chemist, J.A.R. Newland, 4 yearsearlier.He was laughed at in a public meeting of the Royal Society and roundly rejected,evidently because the eight-part division of the table recalled the attempt ofPythagoras to relate all physical laws to the 8 notes (octave) of the musicalscale and thereby suggested “mysticism.”"},{"pageContent":"THE EIGHT FAMILIES OF ELEMENTSARE ARRANGED IN ARHYTHMIC, DIRECTIONAL SEQUENCE [part0005.html#toc_ch5]So let us review, in personal, interpersonal and evolutionary terms, theMendeleyev table.Group 1 The Alkali Metals. The elements in this unstable family have only oneelectron in their outer shell. The one electron is easily lost, zapping off tofuse with other species. This family of metals is easily bound into molecules,heavy, terrestrial and is not found in the air or in space.Group 2 The Alkaline Earth Metals. The species in this family are “down-toearth.” They are found in rocks, indeed, they are basic to geologicalformations—and are not found as frequently in the airy atmosphere.Group 3 The Boron Family. Here we deal with species which make up much of theearth’s crust. They are trivalent (having three electrons in the outer layer)and thus combine easily with other species. We are again reminded of thedefectional tendency of the families of elements—they move from earth upward tothe gaseous atmosphere.Group 4 The Carbon Family. With four electrons in the outer shell these elementscombine wildly in a wide diversity of compounds. The carbons form organicmolecules—almost twice as many compounds as all the other inorganic species. Allliving matter is organic, i.e. carbon derived. All living matter lives on thesurface of the planet, which, as we have seen is formed of the alkaline, earthand boron families. The scum of film which covers the planet is carbon-based.The movement upward away from the earth’s core is the direction of the periodicrhythm of matter.Group 5 The Nitrogen Family. Nitrogen is a gas and makes up 78% of ouratmosphere. This family exists in many forms in nature—gaseous and solid. Themovement upward-outward is thus continued. From the lightest (nitrogen) to theheaviest (bismuth) this family moves from non-metallic to metallic. We deal herewith a group which is transitional from earth to heaven.Group 6 The Oxygen Family. These elements possess six electrons in their outershells. They are both gaseous and solid—again representing the transition fromearth-core to space.Group 7 The Halogens. Fluorine and chlorine are gases. Bromine is a liquid atroom temperature. We deal here with fast-moving species, spacey,super-terrestrial.Group 8 The Noble Gases. Here is an aloof, haughty, aristocratic, “high” familythat disdains to descend to form compounds with the earthy folk. The outer shellof these species are completely filled with electrons—so that they have noearthly needs to combine with other elements. Here the evolutionary trip— fromearth core, to earth crust, to atmosphere to post-terrestrial status iscompleted.images/img-28-1.png [../images/00026.jpeg]The Borons sound Jewish to me!"},{"pageContent":"HE LISTED ON CARDS ALL HE KNEW ABOUT EACH ELEMENTimages/img-29-1.png [../images/00027.jpeg]A sixteen month search leads Mendeleyev to a Swiss ski resort where he discoversCarbon and Chlorine.We are, of course, interested in the psychology of Mendeleyev because it was hisnervous system which first translated, integrated and transmitted the numericalkey. Mendeleyev, we are told, arrived at his insight in the most “get-down,”personal manner. He became friends with the elements whose nature he sought tounderstand. He studied their personality characteristics, literallypsychoanalyzed their interactive tendencies, traced their “family” relations,probed the vicissitudes of their development. He experienced them!It takes an unusually open, confident, we might even say loving person, to getsynergistically involved with the external world in this fashion. Topersonalize, we are not surprised to learn that Dmitri Mendeleyev was,apparently, this sort of human—a lover, an active, sharing person, a committedparticipant in the risky libertarian events of his time. As is the case withalmost every monumental alchemist-philosopher in history, he was in trouble withthe law and risked imprisonment because of his liberal political and culturallifestyle."},{"pageContent":"This book is an attempt to relate the cards of Mendeleyev to the cards of theTarot. [part0005.html#toc_ch6]Most relevant to the theme of this book is the technique used by the Russiansage to organize his knowledge. He listed on separate cards everything he knewabout each element. He carried the cards with him, continually sorting them invarious arrangements, seeking the rhythmic sequence of relationship. He wasoften teased by his friends for centering his scientific activities on the gameof “Patience,” i.e., “Solitaire.”The key to scientific understanding of natural laws—at every level ofcomplexity—is to personalize the events; to experience them, to empathize withthem.The nervous system is the instrument for experiencing.Neurons are composed of atoms and RNA-constructed organic molecules. The nervoussystem, thus has within its own structure, the elemental and molecular eventswhich scientists study in the outside world.Humans whose 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th circuits have been activated are able todirectly experienceimages/img-30-1.png [../images/00028.gif]The unfolding, evolving sequence of the chemical elements sets up an ordinalrhythm which must be related to cycles of evolution at more macroscopic levels.If we can personalize, experience the elements as they evolve and as theyinteract with each other, we may understand not only chemistry but also theperiodicity at the molecular-genetic and the neurogenetic levels.Popularizers of modern science, in dramatizing the high velocities of the modernmetamorphic-evolutionary view (in contrast to the ancient Aristotelian-Euclideanmodel of a static, rigid world) often refer to the “mad dance of atoms.” This isinept semantic fumbling. The metamorphic dance of energy, as revealed in the 8pirouettes of the Periodic Table, is elegant as any ballet. Swan Lake itself maylook quite “mad“ to a naive observer, before the rules, rhythms andperiodicities are recognized."},{"pageContent":"MINERALS, PLANTS, ANIMALS,HUMANS, POST-HUMANSALL DANCE TO THE SAME TUNE [part0005.html#toc_ch7]images/img-31-1.png [../images/00029.jpeg]As Korzybski notes in Science and Sanity:> One of the most baffling problems has been the peculiar periodicity or> rhythmicity which we find in life.

Bose, whodemonstrated around the turn of the century that reaction curves in metals andliving systems are often mathematically identical. “Further work began toconvince Bose that the boundary line between so-called ‘nonliving’ metals and‘living’ organisms was tenuous indeed. When he chloroformed plants, Bosediscovered that they were as successfully anesthetized as animals, and that whenthe narcotic vapor was blown away by fresh air like animals they revived.” Bosealso got similar curves on muscles and metals responding to the effects offatigue or of stimulating, depressing and poisoning drugs.4[part0059.html#part1_fn4]Sir Robert Austen, leading authority on metallurgy, also believed metals are“alive” and hinted at this before the Royal Society, but was rebuffed. He laterdefended Bose’s researches vigorously.Said Dr. Bose himself: “It was when I came upon the mute witness of theseself-made records”—of metal, plant and animal response-patterns—“that Iunderstood for the first time a little of that message proclaimed by myancestors on the banks of the Ganges thirty centuries ago: ‘They who see but onein all the changing manifoldness of this universe, unto them belongs EternalTruth—unto none else, unto none else!”’images/img-32-1.png [../images/00030.jpeg]Bose is a fuzzy Hindu but he’s got the right idea."},{"pageContent":"ORDERED VARIETY AND SEQUENTIAL UNITYREPLACE BLAND HINDU “ALL IN ONE”The danger of such pantheistic insights about the unity of nature is that theyoften freeze thought precisely where it is most illuminating and amusing toenquire further.

If there is any code, any basic pattern to life it mustsurely be based on or relate to this eightfold sequence.This book explores the possibility that the eightfold rhythm of the PeriodicTable defines the metamorphic course of neurogenetic evolution—earthly andpost-terrestrial. And, the possibility that the Periodic Table is the basis forthe great systems of neurogenetic philosophy which have been passed on fromantiquity in the code-form of:The Tri-Octave Systems (24)The TarotThe Greco-Roman PantheonThe Hebrew AlphabetThe Zodiac (Zodiac I + Zodiac II)The Backgammon BoardThe Playing Card DeckThe Octave Systems (64)The I ChingThe Chess BoardWe recall that the Periodic Table is not a static system. The elements evolvethrough the atomic numbers. They decay, fission, fuse, link-up. The PeriodicTable is an evolutionary, metamorphic array.Using this clue we shall study the alchemical-philosophic system of Tarot to seeif it expresses a metamorphic system, an evolutionary code.A second clue is provided by the February 19, 1979, issue of Brain/MindBulletin, in which the question is raised, “Why are all the elements involved inbiological systems—calcium, magnesium, potassium, for example—adjacent in theperiodic table of elements?” Quoting recent research by Louis Kevran, HistokiKomaki and Frederic Jueneman, the article suggests that these elements “may havebeen transmuted from one another” and that “Such a transmutation obviously wouldhave great significance for evolutionary theory,” since it implies a derivationof organic chemicals from metallic chemicals—much as we would expect from theresearch of Bose and Lillie already mentioned.Another line of investigation, by such physicists as Dr. Nick Herbert, Dr. JackSarfatti and Saul Paul Sirag, suggests a similar continuity between thesub-microscopic quantum jumping of the inner-atomic world and “macroscopicquantum behavior” of living systems—e.g. the rhythmic staccato of crickets’chirping, the migratory habits of various species, the mutational cycles ofinsects and of nervous systems, etc. In all of these periodicities we seestructure as a basic fact not in space but in space-time.images/img-35-1.png [../images/00035.gif]images/img-36-1.png [../images/00036.jpeg]*MYSTICISM.

These eased the agonies ofhis many inexplicable illnesses, which modern biographers tend to regard aspsychosomatic. It is usual to explain that Darwin was so often ill because ofthe psychological stress of his extreme sexual timidity and social shyness.Kenneth Burke, more incisively, has suggested that the great evolutionist, whowas the son of a clergyman and the husband of a pious Methodist lady, knewall-too-well the pain, rage and fury his scientific work would cause inChristian nervous systems. His illnesses, then, were both a self-punishment forhis “blasphemy” and a bio-neural dramatization of his self-doubt.Opium and opium derivatives produce “little death” experiences and suck the userinto fibrous, coiling vegetative realities. It is part of the junky mystiquethat each “hit” is an overdose gamble. The Game of Addiction is to come as closeas possible to the botanical one-way Exit."},{"pageContent":"DOPE FIEND GENIUSimages/img-38-1.png [../images/00037.jpeg]Darwin’s insight into the deep-dark regions of vegetative consciousness was dueto the fact that he was a confirmed opium addict. Most of the great Victorianpoets used opiates and their verse is haunted with the same vegetativedeath-rebirth- metamorphoses imagery, the same Gothic horror, that Darwinorganized so brilliantly and painstakingly into the Theory of Evolution byNatural Selection.Charles Darwin was also an obsessively dedicated scientist, a hard worker ofheroic endurance. It is recorded that when dissatisfied with some details in hisinterpretation of barnacle evolution, he laid aside all other work andremorselessly concentrated on barnacles for nearly seven years. His youngestson, assuming this was the normal adult male role, once asked a neighbor’schild, “What sort of barnacles does your father work on?”At the point of death, or near-death, or in the opiate quasi-death, vastevolutionary perspectives often appear. We define this as the seventh circuit ofthe nervous system. Darwin has been proven right on many points where his actualscientific evidence was wrong or inadequate. We suggest that his seventh circuitneurogenetic visions guided him almost as well as his careful scientificresearch. Most biographers stress his love for and empathy with all forms oflife. His book on worms, behind its objective style, has all the tenderness of apopular dog story for children."},{"pageContent":"PLANT KINGDOM SENDS NEURO-CHEMICAL INVITATION TO APESimages/img-39-1.png [../images/00038.jpeg]The synergetic combination of pain-and-dope will prove to have much explanatoryvalue to future exo-psychological historians and biographers. In addition toDarwin, we think of Nietzsche, who battled his chronic migraine headaches withso many patent medicines that Stefan Zweig described the philosopher’s tiny roomas looking like “a pharmacist’s shop”; Gurdjieff, whose Nietzsche-old visions ofevolution from mechanistic robotry to Cosmic Consciousness were all writtenwhile suffering acute pain from war-wounds and dosing himself with cocaine andhashish; James Joyce, whose painful eye problems, leading eventually toblindness, were treated with cocaine, and who created his own hilariouslynon-Euclidean “in risible universe” as normal vision faded and “it darkled(tinct! tinct!) all this our funnanimal world.”5 [part0059.html#part1_fn5] inthe repeated cycle of pain-bliss-pain-bliss some especially gifted individualscan obtain neurological vistas far beyond the reflex robotry of yokelterrestrial life.Of course, it soon emerged that Darwin’s English-Imperialist view of evolutionin terms of merciless competition did not explain all, or even most, of thefacts. It had to wait half-a-century for the rediscovery of the works of anequally shy and timid individual, the monk Gregor Mendel, before the geneticmechanism itself was understood. Modern geneticists have noted that there issomething rather implausible about Mendel’s luck in picking for his experimentsjust those species of peas which were capable of producing genetic patternsexpressible in simple arithmetic. In fact, the odds against such “luck” areastronomical. Some have even proposed that Mendel “fudged” his results a little.Others, unwilling to cast such suspicions on a great scientist, propose that oneof Mendel’s assistants did the “fudging.” The stark truth is that, according toprobability, Mendel should have chosen any of thousands of other species whichwould have yielded results not capable of expression in any mathematics known tohis time; not expressible at all until the invention of the genetic calculus byEnglish mathematician-biologist J. B. S. Haldane in our own time. Where and howdid Mendel receive this revelation from Egg Intelligence?images/img-40-1.png [../images/00039.jpeg]It must be remembered that Gregor Mendel was a monk in an ascetic order. He wastrained in the Catholic form of yogic meditation, which consists (in vernacularterms) of monotony and isolation from hive pressure. Modern researchers callthis “sensory or social deprivation” and have noted that it producesneurological effects similar to various neurotransmitter drugs, e.g. LSD andmescaline. (The interested reader can pursue this subject in the works of JohnLilly, M.D., who has conducted extensive and courageous self-experiments withboth LSD and social deprivation, as recounted in his Programming andMetaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer, The Center of the Cyclone andSimulations of God.) Mendel, it is possible, had passed through a neurological“little death” in which hive imprints and conditioning are suspended viameditation and social deprivation, and was able to receive signals from theneurogenetic archives (Seventh Circuit).The philosophical meaning of the discoveries of Darwin and Mendel were notunderstood in 1979, even by the “intellectual” classes.When Watson, Crick and Franklin discovered the double-helix of the DNA molecule,the energy laws underlying Darwinism and Mendelism became clearer.Despite the mathematical beauty of Mendel’s (and, later, Haldane’s) geneticlaws, despite the increasing revelation of beauty and harmony throughout theenergy sciences, the power of Darwin’s grim, prim vision hooked biologists(outside Soviet Russia, where Marxist dogma ironically led toward a Lamarkianapproximation of the now-emerging true picture). Darwinian “blind mechanism”allegedly explained everything, even the facts it most glaringly didn’t explain.We know that DNA pre-programs evolution in much the same sense that a humanoperator programs a computer.

Since we propose thatthere are eight potential circuits in the human nervous system, it is possiblethat kundalini yoga is a primitive system for reception, integration,transmission, programming, reprogramming and meta-programming on these circuits.Other primitive neurogeneticists have also discovered various properties ofthese eight circuits—the neurological octave—and have sent us transmissions, inthe mythic-poetic language available in their historical epochs.

Whytwenty-four?Because each of the eight neural circuits has three sequential functions: * reception of signals; dendritic, the Siva function * integration of signals (intelligence); cell-body, the Brahma function * transmission of signals; axonic, the Vishnu functionThese three functions are based on the structure of the synapse itself. To quotefrom Dr. Herrick’s Introduction to Neurology, “The structure of the simplereflex circuit [may be illustrated as follows]…The receptor (R) may be a simpleterminal expansion of the sensory nerve-fibre or a very complex sense organ. Theeffector may be a muscle or a gland.” In any case, the receptor must firstreceive a signal, the nucleus must then integrate the signal and the effector(E) must then transmit the signal onward to whatever nerves, muscles, glands,etc. may be appropriate."},{"pageContent":"THE BASIC TRINITY OF HINDUISMSYMBOLIZING THE RECEPTIVE, INTEGRATIVE AND TRANSMITTING FUNCTIONS OF THE NEURONimages/img-67-1.png [../images/00066.jpeg]As Herrick notes, “A simple reflex act involving the use of so elementary amechanism as has just been described is probably never performed by an adultvertebrate.” Instead, chains and networks of such reflex-arcs are activated. “Itmust be kept in mind that in higher vertebrates all parts of the nervous systemare bound together by connecting tracts (internuncial pathways)… These manifoldconnections are so elaborate that every part of the nervous system is in nervousconnection with every other part.”9 [part0059.html#part1_fn9] But at each levelof complexity, this three-beat pattern remains: reception, integration,transmission (or action).The Chinese describe the dogmas of Lao-tse, Buddha and Confucius as the ThreeTeachings.It is easy to discern the three neural functions in this oriental trinity:Lao-tse re-presents the passive, self-indulgent, unattached dendritic aspect ofthe teaching. Siva.Buddha integrating, comparing, seeking the Middle Path reasoning re-presents theneural cell-body. Brahma.Confucius re-presents the axonic stage of the neural impulse—concerned withsocial fusion, external connections, interpersonal linkages. Vishnu.In contrast to the Newtonian rigidity of the Judaic doctrine which was to takepossession of the Western world, the three Chinese teachings are seen to beprimitive Einsteinian. They are personal, relativistic, tolerant doctrines. Theyare doctrines of a Way, a Path, a genetic Nobility. In short they areevolutionary. They avoid the dogmatic Newtonian commitment to one-church,one-static-truth, one ritual and are perfectly in tune with the neurologicalstructure of reality. As pointed out by H.G. Wells, “This attitude is flatlyantagonistic to the state of mind that was growing up in the Jewish communitiesof Judea, Egypt, and Babylonia, in which the thought of the one God was firstand foremost. Neither Gautama nor Lao-tse nor Confuscius had any inkling of thisidea of a jealous God, a God who would have ‘none other Gods,’ a God of terribleTruth, who would not tolerate…any trifling with the stern unity of things.”images/img-68-1.png [../images/00067.jpeg]RECEPTION The first stage of each circuit unfolds after migration, afterrejection of adulthood. Self-indulgent, self-defining. The Dendritic network ofthe newly-evolved, emerging circuit must expand and open up to incoming signalswhich are not registered by the lower circuits. The First Circuit infant, forexample, does not receive the kinasetheic signals which are the input of theSecond muscular-dominance circuit. At puberty, the post-adolescent becomes awareof myriad sexy signals (invitations to sperm-egg transfer) to which the ThreeBrained child is blind.As soon as a new circuit is activated, usually after a migration to a newecological niche, the species and the individual go through a passive-receptivephase of exploring and rejoicing in the new spectrum of signals. We call thisthe dendritic “consumer” phase. Self-discovery. The left-hand column of theNeurogenetic Table lists the eight narcissistic passive stages. Thisself-indulgent stage is symbolized by the Siva function of the Hindu Trinity.Because it involves a juvenile paedomorphic abandonment of the Adult Hive.INEGRATION Dendritic fibres carry the signal to the cell body. The centralcolumn of the Table represents the integration which occurs in the cell-body ofthe neuron, and in the higher plexes of the nervous system. The neural centerreceives incoming dendritic messages, stores, analyzes, evaluates and relatesthus creating the local reality, via transmission. Eight levels of Intelligence,of Self-Actualization, of Reality Creation are thus defined. This integrativestage is symbolized by the Brahma function of the Hindu Trinity.TRANSMISSION Each neuron and neural circuit is hooked up to and designed fortransmission. The axon. Linkage, fusion is the third sequence in thecon-telligence process. The aim is communication. Synergic linkage multipliesmeaning, migration and intensity. This social-fusional stage is symbolized bythe Vishnu function of Hindu Trinity.The right-hand axonic column of the Table is active-transmitting, migrating,moving, linking and defines the eight levels of synergic fusion, i.e., formationof new gene pools by self-actualized migrants.TABLE ITHE NEUROGENETIC TAROT ARRAYimages/img-70-1.png [../images/00068.gif]At each stage of evolution—personal or species—the histone layer insulating theunused portions of DNA, is peeled back a section.

The destiny of the species is to evolve through these 24stages. History and current observation suggest that species and individualstend to emphasize one metamorphic stage. Within certain advanced species, wheredivision of labor is used for gene survival, genetic templating has designed arange of subspecies or castes. The DNA, for example, programs certain species ofthe Class hymenoptera (ants, bees) to produce digger, guard, nurse, worker,warrior, drone, winged-sexual, and queen types. It is similar with human beings.The DNA produces twelve human types to keep the human hive colonies going, toplay the twelve roles necessary for terrestrial evolution. The human hive needspassive receivers, active transmitters and synthesizers—twelve larval humantypes to keep the gene-pool moving through time.Although each species and each individual humant moves through the stages, eachspecies and each individual is wired to perform a special hive function.Assume that DNA also is designed to produce twelve post-larval human typesnecessary to keep the chain of post-terrestrial-hive evolution going in thefuture. There is apparently a similarity between the position of a slot in theterrestrial array (first twelve) and the same relative positions in thepost-terrestrial array. The Pisces-Fool (Stage 1) is the mundane form of thepost-hive Floating WoMan (Stage 13). The Taurus-Empress (Stage 3) is the mundaneform of the new-hive Tantra-Temperence slot (Stage 15), etc.The point is this: The same caste functions are needed to keep the new hivegoing at the next level of reality, i.e., ecological niche.Neurological con-telligence means, among other things, freeing one’s self fromthe old-hive genetic template, i.e., metamorphizing beyond one’s mundane zodiacrole.

Planet Earth is one of many million (or billion) life-inhabited planets in the local galaxy. 2. Life is routinely seeded (directed panspermia) on planets like Earth by Bio-genetic Intelligence by means of amino-acid templates which contain the pre-programmed blueprint of the multi-billion year larval planetary cycle. The planet is a womb, a hatchery. When life has evolved through 12 embryonic stages it leaves the planet and assumes self-actualized existence in the galaxy—fabricating H.O.M.E.s, High Orbital Mini-Earths. The unit of life is the gene-pool. In advanced species—social insects, humants—the genetic unit is the hive. The key factor of evolution is the formation of new hives by the fusion of self-actualized winged elite out-castes—who migrate from the old hive, into a new ecological niche. 3. The nervous system meta-morphizes through 24 stages (8 ecological niches). 1. In water 2. On land 3. In artifact shelters (tribal) 4. In cities (insectoid) 5. In Hedonests fabricated by self-actualized bodies 6. In H.O.M.E.s fabricated by self-controlled brains 7. In self-fabricated DNA hives 8. In quantum-gravitational fields 4. The first four circuits of the nervous system (which have unfolded over the last three billion years) are larval, gravity-bound and designed for survival in the 4 niches of the placental planet. These neural circuits fabricate realities and mediate adaptation to the four directional attitudes of planetary life: 1. the ventral attitude, facing forward to accomplish bio-survival linkage in water. 2. the attitude of rising up vertically on land to the appropriate survival posture of dominance-submission, approach-avoidance. 3. three-dimensional attitude; precise manual-laryngeal manipulation of artifacts and manufacture of symbols facilitated by the dominance of the left cerebral hemisphere. 4. the in-out attitude; the development of sociosexual behavior (sexual impersonation) which manages sperm-egg transfer and the subsequent hive domestication roles necessary to protect the young.images/img-83-1.png [../images/00082.gif]Hey!

The only extra-terrestrial being is the angelin card 7, a peripheral figure not mentioned in the label of the card. The Wheelof Fortune, a neurogenetic-egg-principle card, exceptional in several respects,will be discussed later. We note that the Wheel of Fortune shows a circle(planet earth) and floating in clouds around the circle, form winged figures.This card seems to summarize the neurogenetic theory. Migration from terrestrialhives to post-terrestrial hives.These twelve archetypes are the Twelve Old Men who haunt the dreamer’s sleep allthrough Finnegans Wake, reappearing as twelve customers at the bar, the twelvejurors at the trial, u.s.w. Joyce commentators have noted that they are thetwelve apostles (hence the refrain, reminiscent of the Last Supper, “Pass thefish for Christ sake”), the twelve labors of Hercules, the twelve signs of theZodiac, and so forth; as indeed they are in the universal symbolism of Joyce’s“monomyth.” But basically they are the twelve castes of terrestrial humanity,the twelve genetic types that keep the earthside trip dancing within the sameparameters generation after generation.Photos Reveal There Are 12 Basic Normal Terrestrial CastesEVOLUTION MOVES HUMANITY FROM THE EARTH DIRECTLY TOWARD INTERSTELLAR LIFE…The numerical order of the primitive Tarot cards presents a consistentdirectional trend. The twelve lower numbered cards portray the vicissitudes andadaptations of terrestrial hive survival. The higher number cards (12-21)portray extra-planetary hive stages.This trend in the Tarot matches the Neurogenetic theory which holds thatevolution moves humanity from the Earth directly toward interstellar life. Werecognize, also, that this mythic evolutionary direction has been crudelydramatized by all the larval human religions which teach that Humanity struggleson Earth for survival; then leaves for an extra-terrestrial existence. Heaven isthe Hive in the Sky.The same trend, interestingly enough, is found in the ancient Chinese Yin-Yangphilosophy especially as systematized in the I Ching. The two polar factors ofthe Taoist Book of Changes are Earth and Heaven. Eight elemental energies aredefined. A Neurogenetic transformation of the I Ching will be found in The Gameof Life, Vol. III.It has been mentioned earlier that ancient neurogenetic scripts should harmonizewith the energy formulae and the theoretical models of science. So we are notsurprised to find that the Mendeleyev Periodic Table of Elements follows thesame directional trend. The Periodic Table divides the elements into eight“families” based upon atomic weight and number of electrons in the outer shell.The alkali and earth metals have lower numbers of outer electrons; the gaseshave higher numbers. Again we see the movement from earth to air. Consideringthe directional trend of increasing atomic weights (sometimes described as thecurve of binding energy and the temporal hierarchy of matter) we find trends(increased radio-activity, instability) which may have neurophysical andneurogenetic meanings beyond the scope of this rudimentary transmission."},{"pageContent":"LAST 10 TAROT CARDSPortray Post-Terrestrial Realities [part0005.html#toc_ch19]THE POST-LARVAL, EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL CARDSHanging Man: portrays a man floating serenely upside down in a zero gravityatmosphereDeath: a skeleton riding a giant horseTemperance: an enormous winged angel; solar explosions in backgroundDevil: a mythical winged creatureTower: lightening bold fissioning a tower; two giant stylized figures floatingthrough the airThe Star; an enormous red star, seven smaller stars and the naked figure of awomanThe Moon: lunar landscape with stylized moon reflecting lightThe Sun: giant sun over a baby riding a horseLast Judgement: enormous figure of winged extra-terrestrial blowing horn; tinynaked figures arising from containersWorld: Universe, GalaxyA brief glance at this list of 10 cards reveals that no natural, terrestrialhive scenes are portrayed.

Neurogenetic theory looks toatomic physics for explanatory guides. The Periodic Table of Elements is alogical foundation for any model of energy manifestation, even as peripheral asthe psychological and sociological. The Periodic Table defines eight (7 plus 1)families of elements.

Let the Tarot be an Interstellar Neurogenetic Code accurately mapping the unfolding sequence of evolution of the twelve larval stages and the twelve post-larval stages. 2. The most advanced Human technology has approached the stages of genetic self-actualization (cloning, life-extension) and nuclear self-actualization (controlled nuclear fusion). Each human being, indeed, each living entity, has carried the evolutionary process to a certain point along the path by means of serial activation of neural circuits. Knowing the map makes it possible to know how far and from whence one has come and what lies ahead. The map is an ordering of the brain circuits as they sequentially emerge. 3. Each version of the Tarot describes the entire voyage in terms limited by the location of the author. Persons whose nervous systems are imprinted to Domesticated Morality (Circuit 4) will portray all cards in terms of hive roles and hive ethics.images/img-92-1.png [../images/00090.jpeg]Question: What precedent is there for adding new elements to an ancient system?Answer: “Dimitri Mendeleyev, a leonine man of dauntless spirit.” It is notsurprising that Mendeleyev, who figured out the periodic rhythm of physicalmatter, is described in the biographies as one of the sexiest chemists. In lateryears, when he took a second wife while not yet divorced from his first, theczar’s reported comment was, “Mendeleyev has two wives, yes, but I have only oneMendeleyev.”images/img-93-1.png [../images/00091.jpeg]I have only one MendeleyevAs Mendeleyev was writing his classic text, Principles of Chemistry, eventuallypublished in 1868, he, like all previous chemists, was frustrated by the absenceof any systematization of the enormous body of facts about the behaviors of thedifferent elements. Influenced by cabalist and alchemical theories he began tobuild up a dossier on each element. Like any good detective or intelligenceagent he patiently listed all the evidence about each element on cards, shapedin the oblong form of playing cards.On each card Mendeleyev wrote the numerical properties and personalitycharacteristics of each element—seeking the “periodic,” repeating order—themodus operandi, the hang-outs and partners-in-time. Dimitri discovered a basicrhythm—of lateral rows and vertical columns which reflected the physical andchemical correspondences among the families of elements.The fascinating issue was this: Mendeleyev was able to arrange the elements in atabular order based on symptoms, i.e., external behaviors, without understandingthe underlying atomic structure and without realizing that the elements havebeen and still are evolving, mutating, transmutating in a predictable patterndetermined by their species and familial characteristics.As Dimitri arranged the Tarot Table of the Chemical Elements he noted thatcertain slots in the table were empty. He therefore courageously predicted thatthe missing elements existed. “It is possible,” he said, “to foretell theproperties of still-unknown elements.”And here we encounter, once again, the message of this book: it is possible toforetell the properties of still-unknown stages of our own evolution—as speciesand as individuals."},{"pageContent":"HIVE THOUGHT:POLICE REPRESS TAROT MEANING THE ESSENTIAL MEANING OF THE TAROT HAS BEENCONCEALED BY DELIBERATE AND ACCIDENTAL DISTORTIONSDiscoveries about the evolutionary process have always been controversial,indeed—taboo, prohibited, dangerous.images/img-94-1.png [../images/00092.jpeg]How come I’m not Taboo?!The Tarot card deck is an ancient formula of neurogenetic symbols which has beenpassed down over the centuries. A complex psychological signal of this sortwhich persists in time across many generations surely must have someneurogenetic meaning and must relate somehow to modern scientific energy models.Occult systems are time-scripts, neurogenetic messages sent across millennia.They are crude, blurred, short-hand descriptions of energy processes, genetictypes, hive castes, both temporal and structural psychophysical formulae,compressed representations of enduring philosophic, alchemical (i.e.neurochemical) principles.Discoveries about the evolutionary process have always been controversial,indeed, taboo—prohibited dangerous.

The tides of historywashing over such records inevitably wash out their meaning. Symbols loseprecision, Semantic meanings are outdated. Prosody replaces numerical precision.Errors are made in transmission.

We have, for example,designedly incorporated three errors into this script, which will be detected bythe receiver who understands the signal. Alchemical codes preceded thecryptograms of modern chemical companies. One of the classic dangers in thetransmission of energy-knowledge comes from popularization and vulgaracceptance. As soon as a psychophysical principle becomes hive-orthodox, it istaught in authoritarian, rote fashion, and the experimental meaning, the directneurological significance is lost.Errors, both accidental and deliberate, operate like this: “Multiplicationtable; children, repeat after me: one times two is two; two times two is four;three times two is six; four times two is ten; five times two is eight.Such an error is repeated and repeated, bound into texts and bibles,uncritically passed down from teacher and student for generations. For example,the Aristotelian dogmas, the Ptolemaic imperatives, the Euclidean axioms.Occasionally a detached out-caste observer catches the error. To point out that“two times four is eight” invites rejection as a crank or trouble-maker. Onlythe person who understands the principle can detect and correct the errors whichcreep into all communication systems.

Crowley says that his task will be completed by his successor who willmake it more quantitative, scientific and objective.” (Brian Barritt)The cases of Crowley and George Gurdjieff are similar.

Where, one wonders, is thrift and cleanliness?On the surface at least, the Cabalistic array seems to the uninitiated to be aTalmudic laryngeal-mind defense of Domesticated Primate morality.What is missing from the Crowley Tarot is the scientific, evolutionaryperspective. Crowley does broadcast an erotic magnificence, a graceful, tawnylasciviousness, a gleaming phallic radiance, a soft hashishine luxury. TheCircuit V energy seethes and murmurs; but eventually fades, turned in on itself.Even the most perfect neurosomatic union eventually becomes boring. “Keep mehigh,” She murmured. But rapture dissolves. Two sweaty bodies, pulled back bylarval insecurities, worrying about passports and the rent.The evolutionary process moves or freezes. Aleister Crowley represents humanintelligence at its transition point. The rapturous body, floating detached fromterrestrial-life lines, all wired up and nowhere to go.

Gravity and the inability of currenttechnology to reach escape velocity kept him from breaking out.

Every man and every woman is a star. 4. Help me, o warrior lord of Thebes, in my unveiling before the Children of Men!”And throughout the Book of the Law runs the refrain of Nuit, the star-goddess,who represents galactic intelligence in Crowley’s symbology, and who continuallycalls us home:“Come forth, O children, under the stars and take your fill of love.” …“I am above you and in you.” …“They shall gather my children into their fold; they shall bring the glory ofthe stars into the hearts of men.” …“Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law, love under will.” …“I love you! I learn to you!...Put on the wings and arouse the coiled splendorwithin you: come unto me!”“To me!

(It certainly works that way up to the present. Conception isfollowed by a rigorous sequence of predictable changes. Thus it is not occultistto assume that the future is working out according to plan.)The Egg-Wisdom seems to have designed nervous systems to continually evolve (inboth species and individuals) so that at each subsequent stage (up toadulthood—menopause in the individual and up to adult specialization in species)it handles more complexity, wider frequencies of energy input, more precise,faster power of communication, transportation and higher altitude (in the senseof being able to look backward and down at what has happened and, therefore, toscope what is to come).The general outline of the Egg-Wisdom Plan seems obvious from this post-DNAperspective. But until recently even discussion about a “plan” was placed undersevere taboo by both of the monotheistic hive-orthodoxies.Monotheistic species are committed to a creator (Jehovah) whose intelligence andmorality is that of a savage paleolith.Nineteenth century scientists reacted passionately against MonotheisticCreationism by inventing a genetics of blind, repetitious change in whichevolution favored the most murderous seeddispensors.

All monotheisms areobviously the residues of primitive neuro-political stages.For 200 years (1800-200 a.d.) all of the terrestrial hive energies were throwninto patriotic support of one or the other of these ludicrous negative,pessimistic dogmas.The evolutionary plan obviously required a global struggle of the twomonotheisms—usually labelled right-wing Christian and left-wing Marxist—in orderto mobilize hive collectivities in frantic technological competition. Theinevitable results of white-ant versus red-ant rivalry were the great scientificbreakthroughs which allow, indeed, compel the human species to move intoSelf-Actualized Control of:> physiological realities> neurological realities> genetic realities> quantum-nuclear-gravitational field realities.The thesis of this book is that the Tarot array recapitulates andpre-capitulates (i.e. predicts) the Eight Great Steps in Evolution that takeslife from unicellular form (in the primitive oceans of a Flower Planet) up tothe construction and intelligent management of the galaxy itself.

The passive, unattached primordial stage of unicellularbio-survival. Marine, liquid. In the species this stage is AMOEBOID. In theindividual this stage represents the new-born baby.This primitive brain-circuit (which was first built by DNA some 3 billion yearsago) is still wired into your nervous system.

The infantile-receptive consumer phase of the First Circuit.This is initial caste in the evolutionary system; the plastic, unformed,unattached, flexibility of the new-born organism. Occultists call this card thePrimum Mobile, the first life principle, innocent, liquid, dreamy,self-contained wise potential. The Tao infant sage. Fresh and moist from thegenetic pool. Not really adjusted to terrestrial life. The Babe. In-Sanity.“The Fool” is portrayed as youthful. SHe carries a bag. Let the bag in thisequation represent the genetic-material-ovum-sperm.

The attitudeis loose. The direction aimless. Eyes not focussed on Earth. Dreamy,in-different. SHe “lives in lonely understanding of truths too far and deep toexpress in words or deeds.”From the Neurogenetic position of this card we can understand the classicPiscean divinatory meanings assigned to the Fool: folly, disorganized mania,intoxicated incoherence, aimless floating, depth, apathy, nullity, autism.images/img-114-2.png [../images/00108.gif]Don’t weep you Pisces…your divinity appears in Caste 13"},{"pageContent":"YOUR AMOEBOID BRAIN DEMANDS TO BE INDULGED: BEWARE ITS OPIATE, VEGETATIVEINVITATIONimages/img-115-1.png [../images/00109.jpeg]Stage 1 thus reflects newborn other-worldly innocence. The Fool is usuallyportrayed as floating toward danger, Hir back turned away from safety. Thiscaste person is unformed—not quite at home in a mechanized, organized society,where social conformity is required. In looser tribal situations the passivedetached Fool, the Adult Infant, is tolerated and even seen as a source ofsocial strength. This card represents the positive (Laing-ian) aspects ofin-sanity. Opium wisdom—distillation of the fluid, underworld DNA mysterieswhich are RNA-actualized within the vegetative nervous system.This structural caste, the Pisces Personality, represents technologicalincapacity to fabricate external sources of reward. Disinterest in externalcontrol or fusion—biological, emotional, political, domestic. Ambition,competition, engineering manipulation, have no appeal to compare with the richvisceral life. Disregard for rules, indifference to threats and punishments. Thepath of least resistance. Privacy. Amoral flexibility. Oral greed.The Fool is self-rewarding, self-indulgent, self-stimulating, self-contained andself-undoing.Crowley correlates this card with such mythic Jungian archetypes as the “AprilFool” or spirit of spring in the Frazerian vegetation cults: nature’s newbornchild, rising again after death (winter). The Holy Ghost, he says, is theChristian equivalent, and Hoor-par-kraat the Egyptian congate. Hoor-par-kraat isusually depicted with finger in mouth,like a newborn, and symbolizes meditation:the yogic hippy drop-out. Parcifal, also mentioned by Crowley, is a specialcase, in which the mutation to the extraterrestrial equivalent (Pisces II, Stage13 Hanging Man) is clearly indicated; Crowley calls him “the Pure Fool,” sincehis unearthly vision can give him many qualities of the prophet, wandering wiseman, the Mysterious Stranger who is a Magician, etc.In many traditions, fairy tales and allegories, the king’s daughter (symbolizingGaia, earth wisdom) can only be won by such a Pure Fool, who must be an alien, avagabond. A new arrival on the planet.

For each caste we have included the drawing of a chemicalelement based on the logical assumption that bio-neural evolution must berelated to the evolution of physical chemical elements. These element drawings are based upon a revision of the Mendeleyev periodictable of the elements which has been designed by two brilliant 21st-centuryintelligence agents, Jason Saleeby and Francis Busco. The new arrangement ofelements is a double spiral helix! It makes sense, does it not? While it is true that a simple-minded twodimensional table fits nicley in 19th-century books, on the wall of chemistrylaboratories and in the square minds of primitive chemists, still we know thatthe spatial topological relationships among atoms as they evolve and build up incomplexity must be at least three dimensional. And the periodicity whichMendeleyev diagrammed in the rows and columns of his table are more accuratelyexpressed as recurring degree points on an expanding spiral. The Saleeby-Busco periodic spiral of the elements will be detailed in thenext volume in the Future History Series: How to Joyfully Survive the Collapseof Civilization During the 1980s. Here, we simply call the reader’s attention tothe fact that every stage of neurogenetic caste development corresponds to astep in the periodic spiral of elements. We thus remind ourselves that theevolution of the individual nervous system is best understood as relating to theaddition of electron-protons in evolving elements and that the fusions andconnections among humans are best described by the way elements hook up inchemical molecular bonds. The reader is referred to Appendix 1, Page 350 for a brief description of theperiodic spiral of evolution."},{"pageContent":"THE MAGUS [part0005.html#toc_ch28]Portrays your Swimming-Biting Neuro-Technology [part0005.html#toc_ch28]Caste 2NEUROGENETIC TECHNOLOGICAL STAGE: Squirming, biting, swimming.

No insight into the difference between robot impregnationsexuality and pre-parent sexuality that expresses itself in aesthetics, erotics,romance, poetry, inhibited sublimation, broadened search for identity, new formsof caste differentiation. Thus we are not surprised to see this structural andtemporal imprint-mode portrayed by the renunciate figure of the monk. SHe isbachelor-spinster turning away from the uterine Wheel of Parental Adulthood(Caste 11, the integrating-mind of the Fourth Circuit).The Hermit-monk is often described in the glowing terms of naive occultist asseeking the inner-light, the higher wisdom, etc. The medieval symbolism isintuitively correct. The Hermit-monk rejects or post-pones hive-parentalresponsibility and searches for a new way, a higher role. Monkish renunciationof sex is a luxury available only in an affluent culture which can afford to letable-bodied fertile young men and women avoid parental responsibilities and hivework duties. Extended adolescence is the genetic blossom of the successfulspecies, the key to evolution.The Cabalistic letter for Caste 10 is yod, alternately translated as spermatozoaor FIST. Either reading nicely fits the theme of adolescent neoteny. The flower,of course, is Narcissus. Crowley explains the magical instrument association,“Lamp and Wand,” explicitly as “Virile Force reserved.” The gods Aphrodite, Marsand Attis are associated, evidently as images of youthful virility-virginity;Attis, it should be remembered, is said to have castrated himself, eitherdeliberately or accidentally—the myths differ. Similar self-castration by thepriests of Attis is held by some historians of religion to have been imitated bythe psychological castration (celibacy) of the Roman Catholic priesthood. TheEgyptian divinity given by Crowley is Isis, which he kindly explains with thenote: “(as Virgin).”Crowley comments mysteriously, “[The Hermit’s] Serpent Wand...is thespermatozoon developed as a poison…Yod images/nec-172-1.png[../images/00201.gif]=_ Phallus images/nec-172-2.png [../images/00202.gif]=_Spermatozoon images/nec-172-3.png [../images/00203.gif]=_ Handimages/nec-172-4.png [../images/00204.gif]=_ Logos images/nec-172-5.png[../images/00205.gif]=_ Virgin.

In thenormal course, the young woman is automatically, reflexly fertilized. On apopulation basis, human pregnancy is as routine as the breeding habits of fishor fowl.

At thesummit [of the wheel] was another monster with the body of an indeterminatebeast, wings on shoulders and a crown on head.” The mutational-genetic flavor ofthe imagery is unmistakable even when transmitted by pre-Darwinian agents.The Wheel of Fortune card is of interest because it compactly summarizes many ofthe principles of Exo-psychology.The terrestrial-extraterrestrial perspective is illustrated by the circularearth surrounded by clouds.The earth is bisected by four diameters—horizontal, vertical and two diagonal,perhaps symbolizing the spatial parameters of Euclidean survival. The four “S’s”of terrestrial life: Safety, Security, Sanity (hive-acceptance) and Socio-Sexualrole.On the circumference of the circle are a snake and two mythological half-man-half-animal creatures—all symbolizing, perhaps, the process of evolution andmutation.Four winged creatures float on the extraterrestrial clouds, clearly forecastingthe four circuits of post-terrestrial technology: Body, Brain, DNA, Atomic.The book of Ezekial is the classic biblical description of the descent ofextra-terrestrial beings to Earth.

Socialism would abolish the leisureclass that is the mainstay of culture and cater instead to the taste of themass. He who cannot raise himself to the level of those above him, can at anyrate drag them down to his in the name of brotherhood.”Nietzsche then describes the futational nature of Stage 13 in the famous poeticpassage:> “Man is a rope stretched between beast and Superman—a rope over an abyss…> “Man is great in that he is a bridge and not a goal. Man can be loved in that> he is a transition and not a perishing.”images/img-197-2.png [../images/00246.jpeg]Hey!

There is no suggestion of gallows, rope, punishment. SHe is suspended inthe attitude of rapturous detached passivity. Entrancement. De Laurence says,“the face expresses deep entrancement, not suffering...the figure as a wholesuggests life in suspension, but life and not death.“It is a card of profound significance, but all the significance is veiled. Oneof his editors suggests that Eliphas Levi did not know the meaning, which isunquestionable—nor did the editor himself. It has been called falsely a card ofmartyrdom...of prudence...of duty; but we may exhaust all publishedinterpretations and find only vanity. I will say very simply on my own part thatit expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and theUniverse.”Note that this interesting comment by de Laurence attributes no mundane meaningto this card. He refers to “The Divine and the Universe.” The modern meaning of“universe” is post-terrestrial, post-hive.De Laurence goes on to say,“He who can understand that the story of his higher nature is embedded in thissymbolism will receive intimations concerning a great awakening that ispossible, and will know that after…[terrestrial life]…there is aglorious…Resurrection.”1 [part0059.html#part3_fn1]“Great awakening” refers to the Turning-on of the Fifth Circuit...the amused,liberation of the body from terrestrial imprints, the discovery that one is notan Earthling, that the body can get “high”, can be experienced as a gravity-freepleasure machine.

They are apparently not designed for habitationor defense. They resemble pylons or launching towers. Between them is asolar-star. The towers framing the sun can be interpreted as symbols ofspaceship flight. Extra-terrestrial migration. Upward pointing.“The natural transit of man to the next stage of his being...is…one form of hisprogress, but the exotic and almost unknown entrance, while still in thislife…is a change in the form of consciousness and the passage into a state towhich ordinary death is neither the path nor gate.”De Laurence thus hints that the new level is a higher form of biological life.He is coming close to seeing that the first step in post-mundane consciousnessis into the Body. The notion that the Soma must be turned on, that the path toevolved consciousness and accelerated intelligence lies through theSelf-Rewarded Body is taught by certain Hindu, Sufi, Tantrist, Sex-magic andBuddhist schools, but this lesson of Eros and Soma is usually taught indirectly,subtly, because it outrages larval thinking, is anathema to hive-concepts of sinand social irresponsibility.It comes as a great shock to the socialized, hive mind that the first step inneural mutation is via Body consciousness. The world is my body. The firstreality is Somatic. The cunning hive morality warns that it is necessary toinhibit sensual-somatic pleasures in order to survive. If you indulge yourselfyou cannot indulge the hive. The last terrestrial element—Card 12,Justice-Virtue—solidifies this insectoid repression against fleshly experience.Genetic templating, social imprinting and hive conditioning mobilize againstpleasure feed-back and somatic rapture. The RNA instructions of the first fourcircuits define Physiological Self-Reward and Rapture as dangerous, helpless,sinister and sinful.The first element in the Fifth Circuit—the ReversedFloating-Man—Hanging—Serenely prepared us for the break-through revelation. Bodyas Automobile Time-Ship. All the dimensions, meanings and virtues of hive-lifeare suspended, reversed in post-terrestrial existence. This is the lesson whichthe N.A.S.A. bureaucrats and Russian cosmonauts did not learn. The larvalmaterialism of Earth does not work in space. Caterpillar ethics and strategiesdo not apply to the butterfly reality.The resurrected Body is the post-hive vehicle. The face of the horse merges withthe launching tower. Note that the eye of the horse is on the star!In the topology of the three Fifth Circuit cards, the Horse (Stage 14) movesaway from the floating passivity of the Hanging Man (Stage 13) and moves towardsensual fusion and linkage of self-actualized mates (Stage 15). We master thebody, not for passive receptive rapture, not for yogic raptured detachment butfor linkage. Hippie sensuality and Buddhist meditation are delightful, freeforms of T.M.

It’s not too late.By 1979 the production of somatic-electricity between two self-actualizedHedonists was as obvious (and to the uninitiated, as mysterious) as BenjaminFranklin’s experimental summoning down of lightening bolts. The experiment canbe easily replicated at home by any intelligent scientists.1) Retire to a comfortable bedroom where there is total privacy.2) Ingest an adequate amount of a neurosomatic drug. The amount and the name ofthis neuro-transmitter varies from niche-to-niche and from brain to brain. Suchdrugs have, at times, been called MDA, X.T.C. (New York, 1978).3) Arrange the two naked bodies in any standard face-to-face tantricattitude—legs intertwined, woman’s yoni above man’s lingam.4) The two experimenters then softly stroke each other’s bodies for at least anhour. The soft friction of the two aroused skin surfaces then produces anelectrical aura. This usually appears first on the hands—often seen as filmlikegrids between the fingers. Or as loose “rubber-glove-like” auras around thefingers. The grids are clearly electromagnetic structures in that objects can bepassed through them. But they can be manipulated by moving theelectrically-charged finger close to them. The magnetic attraction is oftenvisible as thread-like filaments growing up from the arms. Tiny electricpoint-flashes are also observed. In some cases these filaments become like thethreads emitted from certain marine forms (Portugese men of war, for example)which contain at the ends electrical charges. The charges in this case arepleasurable rather than defensive.The production of such magnetic auras indicates that the neuro-electric circuit(Stage 16) is being activated.The classic Tarot nomenclature is designedly wrong in the case of the “HangedMan” and “Death.” However, “Temperance” is a reasonably accurate vulgarizationfor this element in the sequence. The raw avalanche of body sensation must betempered, harmonized, linked, exchanged. Crowley’s title, “Art,” is moreelegant.images/img-219-1.png [../images/00279.jpeg]In the west, the role of alchemist classically personalizes this Tantric phase.The lesson of alchemy is solve et coagule.

Stage 14establishes personal control, self-reward. Stage 15 links up. The fusion isaesthetic. Merging of self-actualized minds in the Tantric union. The successfulalchemists worked in secret male-female pairs; fusing the somatic magneticpolarities. The fact that the energies of the body must be transmitted, fused inerotic-aesthetic union, was the censored, well-hidden secret of Europeanalchemy.Any body has to be some body to some body to be every body."},{"pageContent":"THE TRANSITIONAL-MIXING-AMBIOT STAGES CREATE THE GENETIC SCHIZOPHRENIASIt is clear that the “trinity” castes we have designated as “ambiots,” “mates”or “matings”—3) Empress, 6) Hierophant, 9) Strength, 12) Justice and now 15)Temperance—represent ecological bonds.

The glue which holds the hive together isthis sense of confidence in the unity principle.Note that megalomanic totalitarianism is acceptable, indeed, necessary to run asuccessful socialist unity. At the same time John F. Kennedy was telling theAmericans to ask what they could do for the hive, the populace was pleased thatthe First Lady, Jacqueline, was flamboyantly and conspicuously, indulgentlypleasing her own aesthetic desires. In a well run totalitarian society the needfor aesthetic-hedonic exhibition is recognized—when limited to the ruling caste.Fourth Circuit schizophrenia occurs when the hive leaders do not accept thecaste-pluralism. When vengeful peasants take over and wish to drag the hive downto the equalitarian level of barnyard brutality—e.g. the Soviet Union.

The individual (and species) discovers thatthe brain is a relativistic instrument which can be dialed, tuned, focused. ThisStage discovers that all reality is composed of electro-magnetic vibrations,patterns of energy. It has been experienced accidentally or naturally by peoplewho in the past have been called mystics (or schizophrenics). Recently thislevel of consciousness has been attained by several million persons who haveexperimented with brain-changing drugs. We refer here to the typical LSDexperience. Sensations from every sense organ are experienced as electricallyalive. In human history this stage has appeared in a small percent of thepopulation who were genetically preprogrammed to attain access to this circuitof the brain. Such experiences were described as “voices” or “divineilluminations”. The deliberate activation of this Stage by use of drugs occurredon a mass basis in the 1960s and thus marked a new stage of species evolution.Caste 16, portrayed as Tarot card DEVIL represents the passive-receptive phaseof the Sixth Circuit.

Neuro-active drugs which fission and accelerate consciousness—notused for discipline-control or link-up but for passive-receptive enjoyment.In many Tarot diagrams the Devil is portrayed as an extraterrestrialsuper-natural winged being who has chained a naked man and woman apart. DeLaurence has this card signifying “the Dweller on the Threshold without theMystic Garden when those are driven forth therefrom who have eaten thepower-given fruit.” When an individual or species evolves to a higher level ofenergy, the initial reaction is to use the energy for self-definition,self-gratification and to strengthen lower hive circuit programs. Externeural,electronic and atomic energies are used for War, I.T.T. profits, CIAsurveillance, political control, electronic hedonism, hucksterism, “G-rated”movies and TV programs supportive of hive morality. On the inner sideneuro-electric receptivity is used for occult mystification, spiritualism,showman-shaman-magic.In 1955 it was capriciously ingenious of Edward Teller, Father of the Hydrogenbomb, to arrange his facial muscles to resemble the Tarot Devil, thusillustrating the “evil” use of post-terrestrial energies for hive warfare.This card reminds us that Einsteinian technology and brain reward drugs are now(1978) being mis-used to pacify, tranquilize, “passify,” mystify, robotizehumanity.The evolutionary function of electronic-atomic energy is to equip humanity forpost-terrestrial linkage. To send and receive interstellar signals. To designand propel Time-ships. Telepathy. To build High Orbital Mini-Earths. (H.O.M.E.s)The use of electronic energies to intensify Fifth Circuit raptures—rock’n’rolleroticism, pornographic films and video-tapes, electric brain stimulation ofpleasure centers—are useful because they support self-definition as electronicconsumer dialing and tuning realities.

But mass-activation of the Sixth Circuit (Stages 16,17, 18) could not happen until the electronic-polymer-fabrication-of-new-shapeswas available and widely used in technological hives.The thought that Einstein had in his teens was this: “What would the world looklike if I rode on a beam of light? Suppose this tram were moving away from thatclock on the very beam with which we see what the clock says. Then, of course,the clock would be frozen. I, the tram, this box riding on the beam of lightwould be fixed in time. Time would have a stop...in keeping up with the speed oflight I have cut myself off from the passage of time.”This simple anecdote may be the key to Einstein “genius.” He obviously was ableto personalize the events he studied; sought to experience his subject matter.Einstein’s third circuit brain (before sexual impersonation) apparentlyimprinted a relativistic symbol-reality.images/img-233-1.png [../images/00300.gif]The 1st generation of Plastic Consumers passively imposed tired old forms on thePlasticity.The 1st generation of LSD Consumers passively imposed tired old “Hippie-Hindu”forms on the New Plasticity."},{"pageContent":"THREE FUTURE STAGES OF EVOLUTIONimages/img-234-1.png [../images/00301.jpeg]drawing by Harold W.

Exploration: Another group used government-sponsored unmanned space probes> to explore the solar system.> 3.

The first group with Carl Sagan and Francis Drake as spokes-1. man (both from the Cornell Center for Interplanetary Studies) wished to construct a five-billion dollar radio-wave reception device called Cyclops. The aim was to search the skies for signals from Higher Intelligence. Passive reception. Project Cyclops was a brilliant reflection of neuro-electric passivity, as symbolized by Caste 16. Project staff members would live near the device in a government-suburb, maintaining conventional hive life-styles while hoping to be contacted by Higher Intelligence! This plan was a more sophisticated version of passive UFO watching. 2. The second external-technological application of post-terrestrial energies involved sending neuro-electronic equipment into space for surveillance-exploration. We cite the examples of un-manned probes of Venus, Mars, Jupiter. And the Russian success in establishing permanent space-stations (Salyut-Soyuz) in High Orbit. 3. The third stage in the post-terrestrial activation of the brain involved a swarming of self-actualized persons in control of their own nervous systems. When this temporal caste appears, it is realized that linkage into new hives is the next genetic step. New personal ecological niches in High Orbital Mini-Earths.

Here we meet the herdsman-shepherd caste whichjealously watches over the survival of gene-pools called flocks and herds;preserving the seed-destiny of domesticated animals.During the Neurogenetic Renaissance (1976 - 1986) Human Ethology replacedreligion, philosophy. sociology, psychology, personology, astrology, psychiatryand every other primitive system of behavioral theory and practice.images/img-272-1.png [../images/00359.gif]Concepts such as temporal and structural caste in social animals, the key roleof migration, population-swarming, hive-limited culture, the emergence of new:post-human species, and human-robotry relegated to antiquity every previoustheory of human behavior.The parents of this first scientific philosophy were the Wilson Brothers, Edwardand Robert—who performed for psychology what Einstein did for physics.

It is no accident thatthe beginnings of evolutionary thinking in the 18th and 19th century can betraced to botanists. Rudolph Jakob Camerarius, Richard Bradley, Philip Millershocked and scandalized the Hive Authorities of the 18th century with theirdiscoveries that plants had sex organs and used them. The great botanist andtaxonomer Linnaeus based his monumental work of species classification on asexual system.

And the man called thewoman Eve.CHAPTER 3Now the Flowering Trees were more subtil than the nomanids and they sent signalsto the woman that She should eat of the flowers and fruit of the Flowering treesand thus be happy and wise and immortal.2 But the woman said, No, for has not God the Powerful macho Man said that if weeat of the flowering trees we shall die.3 And the perfumes and the colors and the soft shapes of the flowers whisperedto Eve, If you cannot experience beauty freely, and if you cannot become wiserand if you are doomed to death, why then are you not dead already?4 So Eve pondered on this and then said, Yes, I trust the message of the flowersbecause they are like me, soft, and giving, and beautiful and wise, and I shallnot obey the Sperm God who imprisons us and threatens to kill us. And if,indeed, this Eden is controlled by such a Sperm God then it were better that Idie and the man, Adam, my husband be saved.5 But if, indeed, the fruit and blossoms and resins of the flowering trees aregood for us then I can share with my husband.6 And when the woman saw that the flowering trees were good to eat, and pleasantto the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she did eat.7 And then She felt great beauty and wisdom and love for all.

One obvious purpose of this life network is to terraform ourplanet and keep it fit for life.The Gaia hypothesis was, naturally, originated by the collaboration of a male,James Lovelock, and an unconventional female cell biologist, Lynn Margulis, whohad been obsessed for years by the realization that the modern cell had beenformed by interspecies “clubbing” and symbiotic linkage of primitive organisms.The Gaia Hypothesis originated in studies of the atmosphere of planet earthwhich continually balances thousands of delicate chemical interactions.Why did our planet not follow the path of irreversible processes that made Marscold and Venus a hot-house inferno?Lovelock made the supposition that life itself controlled the temperature andchemical environment to ensure its own survival, even in the face of greatchanges in the intensity of energy coming from the Sun. It was not luck.Lovelock suggested, but unconscious cooperation among living organisms, frommicrobes to elephants, that kept the Earth in the peculiar state in which allspecies could prosper. Thus living matter, together with the air, the oceans andthe continents, made up a giant and complex system which behaved almost like aliving organism that maintained its internal milieu by subtle feedbackprocesses. To this hypothetical creature Lovelock gave the name Gaia at thesuggestion of a Wiltshire neighbour, the novelist William Golding. Gaia(pronounced gayeeah) was the Earth-goddess of the early Greeks.Great feedback processes in the biosphere were already well known to scientists:for instance, the way plants took in carbon dioxide and gave out oxygen as theygrew, while animals took in oxygen and gave out carbon dioxide; or how somemicrobes fertilised the soil by ‘fixing’ nitrogen from the air, while otherbacteria returned the nitrogen to the air.Dozens of such cycles were well recognized. But the Gaia hypothesis assigned amuch more positive and systematic role to organisms and to their unconsciousknack of keeping things just so. Gaia might always remain more of a metaphorthan a scientific hypothesis open to formal tests, yet it was a fruitful sourceof new interpretations and experiments.The idea became sharper when an American cell biologist, Lynn Margulis of BostonUniversity, joined Lovelock in the early 1970s as a votary of Gaia.To Margulis, Lovelock brought the problem of what could be maintaining the‘anomalous’ gases in Earth’s atmosphere in the presence of oxygen. She was ableto offer a long list of micro-organisms that produced hydrogen, methane, ammoniaand so on. They did so at a great cost in energy, ultimately derived from theenergy of sunlight. In other words, Gaia was working hard to maintain thepeculiarities of the Earth’s air. In Lovelock’s theory, the air acts like thebloodstream of an animal, bringing essential supplies to all of the Earth’sinhabitants and carrying waste products away. Countless numbers of humble andunregarded micro-organisms play their parts in keeping this ‘bloodstream’purified and replenished.images/img-281-1.png [../images/00375.gif]Which came first–the chicken or the egg?images/img-281-2.png [../images/00376.jpeg]The chicken is a mobile unit for manifesting DNA information.images/img-282-1.png [../images/00377.gif]Margulis and LovelockHIGH VELOCITY MALE CHEMIST, LOVELOCK AND SWAMP ORIENTED FEMALE BIOLOGIST,MARGULIS, COMBINE ON NEW THEORYGaia’s key controls seem to be located in relatively neglected parts of theEarth’s surface—in marshlands, in the mud at the bottom of estuaries and in thewaters of the continental shelves. Dry land and the wide open oceans are not asimportant as their large areas might suggest. For example, the airlessconditions in relatively small bogs and enclosed seas have deposited and buriedcarbon fuels, thereby helping oxygen to persist in the atmosphere of the wholeworld. Yet the proportion of oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere does not climbabove twenty-one per cent. A student of Lovelock’s found out that, should itrise by only a few percent, vegetation would become so inflammable that even thetropical forests would burn to ashes. That might be a drastic way of consumingoxygen and restoring the status quo, but Gaia seems to prefer to keep thepotentially dangerous oxygen within bounds. Just how the trick is done remainsto be discovered.10 [part0059.html#part3_fn10]Lovelock and Margulis, we must understand, were Evolutionary Agentsimpersonating scientist-priests in the primitive 20th century. Thus they foundit necessary to use merchanist qualifications such as “unconscious cooperationamong living organisms”; describing Gaia as a “giant and complex system whichbehaved almost [our emphasis] like a living organism.”Implicit in the Lovelock-Margulis theory is the notion of a biologicalintelligence which uses DNA-RNA-sperm-egg selection to activate species in theright space/time niche to perform the evolutionary function.Now this collaboration is “unconscious” only to those human beings who are dumbenough to invent a less intelligent theory of evolution–creation. Once our Caste20 nervous systems grasp the tactics and goals of evolution then we canplanfully and effectively contribute to the Gaia plan.From the vantage of the 21st century we can look back tolerantly and smile atthe attempts of Darwinians (and Monotheists) to explain evolution. Thebarbarous-sperm notion of natural selection of the fittest can be cumbersomelyused to explain most genetic events. We recall that pre-Copernican astronomerscould explain stellar-planetary motions in terms of a geocentric theory byadding more and more complex refinements to their formulae. The humiliation ofheliocentricity had to be warded off by good Christians. When the Copernicantheory was accepted then celestial mechanics became sweetly symmetrical. UntilEinstein.The same is true with the Darwinian theory. It is possible to wrestle with thefacts to justify the Ptolemaic “natural selection” so dear to the heart ofmales. But the crush of new data is making this scholastic dance too ridiculous.The Gaia theory simply provides the simplest explanations.The melanization of moths as a result of industrial pollution is a nice example.According to the fight-fuck Darwinians, the darkening of trees by soot innorthern England caused white moths to be visible and edible. The darker mothssurvived to copulate and pass on their genes. As pollution controls eliminatedthe soot, then the dark moths got eaten and the lighter moths survived tocopulate.The Gaia intelligence solution seems simpler. When the moth RNA signalled DNAthat soot levels were increasing then Gaia turned the melanization dial andselected darker sperm to change the species coloration.The story of the foxes in France is a classic example of genetic savvy.Urbanization and population increase was threatening to wipe out the foxes. Whenworried naturalists studied the few remaining fox families they made asurprising discovery. The average fox litter was eight or nine of whichtwo-thirds were female cubs. Usually a mother fox dropped only two cubs—dividedequally between male and female. How does the Darwinian theory explain thisfinding?The Gaia explanation is straightforward. The fox DNA acted just like a humanmanager would act. When the swarming excursion brought the message back—CNS toRNA to DNA—“Hey, our numbers are dwindling,” the Gaia brain just pushed twodials—more, and more females.If Lovelock, Margulis, Leary and other earth-bound fore-castes in the 20thcentury could sketch in the basic tactics Gaia uses to evolve speciesintelligently, there can be little doubt that She could have perfected thedetails in fifteen billion years of evolution.images/img-284-1.png [../images/00378.jpeg]“The closer I was pulled into the sun-surface the more I felt myself dissolving,merging with the whirlpools of warm in-formation.”images/img-284-2.png [../images/00379.jpeg]Which came first–the sperm or the egg?images/img-284-3.png [../images/00380.jpeg]The sperm is an infectious viral guest which she wove into the empty slots inHir DNA blueprint"},{"pageContent":"THE TIME HAS COMEFor You to Create New Speciesimages/img-285-1.png [../images/00381.jpeg]The 20th Caste, portrayed by Tarot SUN, has attained Biological Wisdom, acompassionate, responsible control of DNA.

The strongest,fastest would breast the ovum finish line—the victor! Miss Egg, it was assumed,would dutifully and gratefully give the laurel crown to the champ whoimmediately moved in to issue his chromosome commands.“I recall,” says one Evolutionary Agent, Caste 20, “being approached at acocktail party by a biologist who clapped me on the back and shouted,‘Congratulations. You were the one that made it!’“ ‘Made what?’ I replied.“ ‘You were the sperm that won the race.’ ”"},{"pageContent":"I HEARD HER SAY: I WANT YOU!images/img-291-1.png [../images/00391.jpeg]“ ‘Get away from me with this locker-room jock talk,’ I replied.

But Ididn’t join the race. My sperm-navigation manual told me that this was anaesthetic-intelligence test. So I was in no hurry. I floated along anddiscovered to my delight that Mom’s recreational system was the most wondrousexciting environment!

Finally the tide-tow floatedme closer and closer to the goal. The Egg! First, let me tell you of itsmagnificence. The ovum is fifty thousand times bigger than the sperm body. Itcan only be described as a sun—radiating light and powerful vibrations. As Iapproached I saw, to my surprise, that the Ovum, far from being a passive blobwaiting to be penetrated by the phallic sperm, was surrounded by magnetic fieldsand bristled with radar scanners and laser defenses. As each sperm plowed intothis field it was scoped, studied, and then lasered into shriveled debris.“ ‘This discovery confirmed my intuition not to rush in with macho zeal. I laidback, observing carefully the many sensory apertures, trying to decipher theelectro-chemical signals that SHe was emitting. Trying to figure out what SHeliked, what SHe wanted. After a while I sensed-felt a soft magnetic pull andproceeded gently up an energy channel that brought me closer to the radiant sun.I could feel myself being scanned and, in a strange way, instructed. I tried toconvey my admiration and my understanding of the truly magnificent conversationthat we were conducting. I felt tremendously excited, amused, energized andilluminated.

Plantspatiently and humorously select and train animals to transport, court, care-for,and impregnate plants. Vegetative Intelligence rides in the driver’s seat of thelumbering animal body. Even in the late 20th century males could not deal withEgg Superiority. Note, in this review, how the writer continues theJudeo-Christian image of the wicked-lurid-wanton-insatiably sexy female!Plants invented sex and deceit. One of the best at both arts is the bee orchid,Ophrys apifera, which has evolved a replica of female bee genitals. The floweropens early, before female bees are around. The eager male flies in anddiscovers the exact color, texture and scent he is looking for. During thepseudo copulation, the flower’s male sex organ attaches a sticky disc to thebee. The female organ of another orchid peels off the pollen-bearing disc andanother generation of flowers is on the way.Sex among the flora seems as round-about as it is among the fauna—with someimportant differences. Plants’ biggest problem is how to copulate from adistance. Some species depend on wind to carry pollen. Others have evolved RubeGoldberg systems for tricking insects and other organisms into serving as sexualintermediaries. Orchids use a quick-setting glue to attach pollen. Milkweedsshackle visiting insects with sets of clips, the equivalent of leg irons. Thearum lily plays a more dangerous game—it relies on flower-eating snails. If asnail plays too rough, the lily sprays it with a caustic juice, which can scaldit to death.Sexual reproduction evolved in plants, as in animals, to avoid the dangers ofinbreeding. Most plants are hermaphroditic and capable of self-pollination, butuse that process only as a hapless last resort. If no bee comes along, the maleorgan of the bee orchid withers and droops near the female stigma—betterself-love than no love at all.Other species have developed stratagems to avoid solo sex. One jujube opens itsmale and female blossoms at different hours. The sea pink has coarse pollen andsmooth stigma in one plant, and smooth pollen and coarse stigma in another.The beauty and fragrance of flowers are by-products of a complicated sex life.Wind-pollinated species, with no need to dress up for insect visitors, aregenerally drab. Dazzling blossoms are for bugs, with shallow, wide-petaledplants adapted to primitive species, and deeper flowers with frillier petalsluring more sophisticated insects.As in the current spate of books on the animal world, the unstated aim is totake uppity humans down a peg. There seems to be no human sexual problem thatshrubs have not suffered for millions of years.

Darwinians are male chauvinist prigs. We can understand andsympathize with their problem. It was their exciting duty to introducescientific evidence which changed the orthodox cosmology of the times. For twothousand years the Judeo-Christian hive-collective had brutally imposed abarbarous theory of creation. (The cosmology held by a hive, i.e. its theory ofcreation is the basic structure which unifies and organizes the Egg Collective.)To link-up and manage the large multitribe collectives necessary to produce anindustrial society it was necessary to impose monotheism. Thus a simple-minded,crude shepherd Jewish tribe divinity was elevated to cosmic importance.

But Darwin and Freud were too timid toburst out of the hive and allow an untidy Egg-Pluralism. So they replaced theBible with another Male Model—grim chance, natural selection, struggle forexistence, survival of the fittest.

Each particle has afixed angular movement in the same way that it has a characteristic internalstructure and magnetic charge.When two spinning particles interact, the result depends on how they arespinning. For instance, the path taken by a particle after a meeting can beaffected by the entity’s self spin just as the “English” applied to a pool ballcan change the ball’s trajectory. It had long been held, however, that theeffect of spin should decrease as the intensity of inter-particle interactionincreases. The thinking behind this hypothesis was simple: the energy involvedin a particle’s self spin is constant, and thus it should become an everdecreasing fraction of the overall energy as the interaction becomes moreintense. According to this Newtonian notion, in very intimate, close, intenseinteractions of protons it should make no difference whether the two arerotating the same way or in the opposite direction.Only in the past few decades have neurophysical experiments been devised to testthis hypothesis. It has been clearly disproven. The effect of self spin does notdecrease as the energy of an interaction increases. On the contrary, self spinappears to play a more important role as the interaction becomes more intense.Recent studies of high velocity interactions have shown that particles rotatingin the same direction are much more likely to increase their velocity andcomplexity than particles rotating in opposite directions. Particles withopposite spin usually appear to pass through each other without interfacing atall.The meaning of these researches seems clear. One interpretation holds thatwithin the proton there are smaller particles which account for most of theproton’s self spin. These internal particles must be rotating very quickly. Sometime before these data were published it had already been suggested that theproton has an internal “personality” structure. One theory proposed that eachproton has a tiny, dense center, a “brain,” which directs its movements. A modelin vogue today suggests that every proton is composed of three tiny, powerfulentities called quarks. There is considerable experiential evidence to supportthe quark model. However, other research has shown that these internal traitshave characteristics somewhat at odds with the quark model. Spin seems to bemuch more important than previously thought.Angular movement (i.e. the attitude) of a particle is proportional to its spinvelocity and is also affected by the personality structure of its mass. Everyentity has two kinds of attitudinal movement: orbital (or planetary) movement,and self spin. Orbital movement was personalized in the planetary model of theatom proposed by Neils Bohr in 1909 and the planetary migration-momentum modelof human behavior suggested in 1979 by Timothy Leary. The planetary angularmovement of an electron in a Bohr-Leary model is proportional to the speed withwhich it rotates around its center (i.e. the earth) and its altitude (the radiusof its orbit) and to its internal personality characteristics, i.e. mass.Orbital angular movement also appears in any brief encounter between entities.Even if the entities never encircle each other they still momentarily spinaround their mutual center of gravity.Spin angular movement calibrates the movement of a single entity around its owninternal center (self). In quantum mechanics as in neurologic andexo-psychology, self spin is very different from orbital angular movement. Anentity can increase or decrease orbital angular movement depending on theattractiveness and comfort of the ecological situation, as when an electron inan atom suddenly migrates from one energy niche to another and thus from oneorbit to another. Self spin on the other hand is an enduring trait of eachparticle. The velocity of the spin can be altered only by changing the imprintof the entity itself.Spin movement is often described as an attitude, a personality posture, whichhas both a magnitude and a direction. The spin attitude can be portrayed as anarrow parallel to the axis of rotation and with a length representing theintensity of the spin. “The direction of the arrow is defined by the arbitraryconvention called the right-hand rule. If the fingers of the right hand arewrapped around the particle in the direction in which it is rotating, then thethumb indicates the direction of the spin vector. According to this convention,the spin angular momentum of the earth could be represented by a vector at theNorth Pole pointing up.”These two concepts of orbital spin and self spin which revolutionized physicstoward the end of the 20th century helped produce a similar quantum leap in ourunderstanding of human behavior. Each human being was able to diagnose hir ownself spin. Forespinners interacting with each other along the vector ofplanetary spin (i.e. the genetic runway) were able to generate the energy tojump into a higher orbit (i.e. migrate). Back-spinners were able to guide thosewith similar eastern orientation to jump orbits down. This is the harmony andbalance of the planetary atom maintained. While fore-spinners swarm along theSunset Strip generating the energy to migrate to higher orbits, back-spinners,in the Middle East, were feverishly jumping down to the Biblical and Koranicorbits."},{"pageContent":"THE SPIN OF THE PERSONWhen two persons interact, the outcome depends on which way the persons arespinning. The effect seen in high intensity collisions suggests that spin is oneof the basic determinants of human behavior.All the fundamental levels of of human behavior (the four hive circuits plus thesomatic, neurological, and genetic) seem to involve spin. Rotation is one of theintrinsic properties of the behavior of every living organism. Each human beinghas a fixed angular momentum in the same way that SHe has a definite caste and abio-electric charge.When two spinning humans interact, the outcome often depends on how they arespinning. For example, the path taken by a human being after a meeting can beaffected by the person’s spin just as the “english” applied to a billiard ballcan alter the ball’s trajectory. It has long been thought, however, that theinfluence of spin should decline as the energy of the interpersonal interactionincreases. The reasoning behind this assumption is simple: the energy associatedwith a person’s spin is constant, and so it becomes an ever smaller fraction ofthe total energy as the interaction becomes more intense. According to thisNewtonian psychology in very intimate, close, intense relationships it shouldmake no difference whether the two people are spinning in the same direction orin opposite directions.Only in the past few years have neurological experiments been devised fortesting this assumption. It has turned out quite wrong. The influence of spindoes not diminish as the closeness of a human interaction increases. On thecontrary, spin seems to become more important as the relationship becomes moreintense. Recent studies of high-velocity marital-couples has shown that peoplespinning in the same direction are much more likely to increase theirvelocity-intelligence than persons spinning in opposite directions. Persons withopposite spin often seem to pass through each other without interfacing at all.An example of a person spinning east (back spinner) is Woody Allen. A prominentwest-spinner (fore-spinner) is Thomas Pynchon. Ho hum. There is no evidence thatthey have influenced each other at all. The authors of thisbook—fore-spinners—have been tremendously accelerated by Pynchon. Thewest-spinner, having passed through eastern sectors, understands them; theAyatollah Khomaini does not “see” Thomas Pynchon; whereas the California writerdoes understand the past-caste mullah.images/img-341-1.png [../images/00450.jpeg]At the early stages of development we rotate around the center of the localimprint—i.e., the neural reality. Children before adolescence and humangene-pools before civilization rotate only around the personal neuro-ecology.But when the individual attains adolescent mobility and when the gene-pool hasattained migratory competence then fixed-spin in relationship to the rotation ofthe earth becomes the most important genetic determinant.images/img-341-2.png [../images/00451.jpeg]A moment’s reflection will verify the truth of this astounding fact: Ninety-ninepercent of all successful human gene-pool migration during the last 2000 yearshas been East-to-West. Against the spin of the planet. Can you think of onegene-pool which has succeeded by moving eastward? It awaits to be seen whetherthe Australian migration is a genetic side-alley or whether, some time in thefuture, intelligent life-signals are emitted from “down-under.”When we consider north-south migration we note that there has been less of it.There is no clear vector of human swarm-movement in relationship to the magneticpoles. And those that do exist—Europeans to South America, Europeans to SouthAfrica and Africans into the northern hemisphere have been notoriouslyexploitative, unattractive, consistently conflictful and unassimilative.The importance, the exclamation-point intensity of the East-West migration islost to humans who are still involved in the leap. But in terms of energy-scansof this planet—the movement along the Genetic Runway from east to west in thelast 2000 years qualifies as a quantum-jump. From the placid bullock-fields ofAsia to the jet-jammed runway of LAX in one fast flash.We can only deduce that the smart (high-energy dealing) gene-pools squirted westor they were made smart by migrating.images/img-341-3.png [../images/00452.jpeg]Each time you move one time zone west you jump to a higher orbit!

From famed psychologist and Harvardprofessor to LSD Guru, to stage and film star, computer junky, and more.Tim leaves no stone, or for that matter, person unturned.As an unrepentant advocate of personal freedom and development, he was on amission to wake humanity up, to encourage us to use our brains and open ourminds up to different ways of thinking. One of his favorite mottoes was \"Thinkfor yourself and question authority.\"The Game of Life is an organic computer, (although when Leary wrote it he wasn'tyet into hyper-interactive computer intelligence.) In this book he updated themeaning of Medieval Tarot Cards and Chinese I Ching Triagrams and used thesymbology to express his fascinating theories within a multi-dimensionalstructure. With a unique intelligent wit, he expresses his perceptions, wisdomand ideas that evolution is proceeding into pre-programmed post-human stageswhich will carry us off the planet, but also that some human beings are (havealways been) literally ahead of their times in having activated what Dr. Learycalls \"circuits\" of their nervous systems years or even centuries ahead ofgeneral human development.The Game of Life is not simply a book: it is an experience."}]
